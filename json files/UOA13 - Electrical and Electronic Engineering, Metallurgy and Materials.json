These spin-outs currently employ over 150 people and a\u000d      global impact has been attained with world-wide sales totalling more than\u000d      &#163;30m per year, with significant benefits to patient wellbeing (numerous\u000d      lives saved) and reduced costs to healthcare systems for patient care.\u000d      This success has led to the establishment of the European Connected Health\u000d      Alliance, led by McLaughlin, which has 150 members including Intel and\u000d      Bosch and provides a strategic consultation role which impacts directly on\u000d      NI Government and global business policy. With an award of &#163;5m funding we\u000d      have established the Connected Health Innovation Centre (CHIC) as an\u000d      industry-centred competence centre, which focuses on rapidly translating\u000d      academic research into innovative medical products.\u000d    Our spin out companies are Heartsine Inc.

[3] which was sold\u000d      to Verathron [text removed for publication]. All company products are\u000d      well- established with full CE and FDA approval. The product portfolio,\u000d      based on licensed NIBEC patents, includes devices such as PRIME ECG, Vital\u000d      Signs Wireless Patch, 12-lead holter- telemonitoring, AED defibrillators,\u000d      telemonitoring platforms, ECG electrodes and a range of algorithms to\u000d      licensed companies such as Samsung, Tyco and Meridian Medical. In\u000d      particular, our licensed electrode technology has created the world's\u000d      best-selling disposable ECG electrode [3], with $70m sales and sold by\u000d      Tyco, HP, Ludlow and Space Labs, among others. The Automatic Equipment\u000d      Defibrillator developed with Heartsine, is the most compact AED with an\u000d      annual turnover of &#163;20m; the telemedicine based 12-lead electrodes systems\u000d      licensed to SHL Telemedicine has generated $5m sales and a 120 electrode\u000d      ECG mapping system called PRIME ECG is now selling via Heartscape\/Veratron\u000d      (USA) [3].\u000d    Intelesens Ltd, with McLaughlin as current CTO, has developed a\u000d      miniaturised chest worn platform incorporating wireless, algorithms for\u000d      arrhythmia and motion detection and impedance-based monitoring of\u000d      temperature and respiration patterns [8].

Intelesens and the current 44 qualified staff\u000d      complement is set to rise as manufacturing is developed worldwide via GE\u000d      Healthcare, who launched in the US, the Surveillance Carescape 300 Product\u000d      in May 2013 [2]. In 2011 Intelesens won the prestigious202f\"Most Promising\u000d      Technology Award\"202fat the 4th Annual Silicon Valley Technology Leaders\u000d      Awards and in the same year Intelesens was awarded class 2 regulatory\u000d      approval by the FDA authorities in the USA [6]. Although the company has\u000d      already around &#163;1m a year turnover, international sales of its\u000d      defibrillator pad range and V-patch sensor systems is increasing and full\u000d      commercial realisation is expected in late 2013 when GE Healthcare fully\u000d      launch the globally FDA approved `Surveillance Carescape 300', which\u000d      brings ECG arrhythmia recognition, respiration rate, fall detection, body\u000d      temperature and heart rate into one wearable platform [2].\u000d    HeartSine's development of the world's most compact AED was based on\u000d      NIBEC's chest impedance and arrhythmia algorithms, in conjunction with\u000d      novel bi-phasic waveform patterns. This company [text removed for\u000d      publication], employs 80 people in Belfast and Pennsylvania, has 2 NIBEC\u000d      licensed patents and is currently exporting to over 40 countries,\u000d      including the USA [1]. The company has its headquarters in the USA and has\u000d      been highlighted as a top example of smart portable lifesaving healthcare\u000d      systems.\u000d    Recently one of Heartsines products hit the headlines when it was used in\u000d      the miraculous survival of former Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba (2012).\u000d      HeartSine now manufactures 2,500 units a month and as noted by the Prime\u000d      Minister David Cameron in recent speeches, its AEDs are to be found in the\u000d      White House and on AirForce One. They are also favoured by many\u000d      international airlines, sports bodies and emergency services, from Shell\u000d      Oil super-tankers to American Airlines and the Singapore EMS service [1,\u000d      9].\u000d    With McLaughlin as a Director of the European Connected Health Alliance\u000d      (&#163;500k Collaborative Network &amp; &#163;500k EU), as a member on a number of\u000d      influential Government Task Forces (Connected Health and Prosperity Board;\u000d      the NI Connected Health ECO System Board, the Connected Health Innovation\u000d      Centre Board) and an advisor to Task and Finish Groups on the subject of\u000d      Connected Health, the expertise derived from NIBEC research and commercial\u000d      realisation now impacts on core government policy and industry direction\u000d      within this sector [4, 5]. This work is currently expanding our links with\u000d      the New York State and the San Diego regions, where similar activities are\u000d      growing.\u000d    The ECHAlliance, which was set up in 2010 to follow-on to the European\u000d      Connected Health Campus, is an initiative designed to support and promote\u000d      the wider adoption of healthcare and wellbeing (including sports and\u000d      fitness) products, services, applications and innovation. In bringing\u000d      together commercial, academic and healthcare stakeholders, ECHAlliance\u000d      facilitates focused leadership for the development of `Connected and\u000d      MHealth' markets and practices across Europe and beyond. The scope\u000d      includes the economic development of the full range of eHealth, EHR\u000d      TeleCare, TeleHealth Telemonitoring and MHealth sectors. At present there\u000d      are 150 members including Intel and Bosch.\u000d    NIBEC, through McLaughlin, in partnership with O'Connor (Chair of the\u000d      ECHAlliance) have played a pivotal role in establishing Connected Health\u000d      initiatives in N. Ireland which have directly resulted in an increased\u000d      focus at ministerial level, an inter-department MOU between our Department\u000d      of Health and our Department of Enterprise and Trade, changes in policy,\u000d      expanded government's Connected Health activities and created measurable\u000d      economic and health benefits over these past 4 years [4, 5]. Over 50 local\u000d      companies and over 150 organisations (www.ni-chic.org\/ni-capability.html)\u000d      are benefiting from our new ECO system and the associated &#163;10m of recent\u000d      investments. These benefits include increased employment (e.g. GE\u000d      Healthcare investments at Intelesens with over 40 jobs), Foreign Direct\u000d      Investment (e.g. Arc Devices, 10 jobs initially) and the rolling out of\u000d      new systems such as NI's Patient Record System involving major investment\u000d      by Orion (15 R&amp;D jobs).\u000d    In order to help deliver the impact of our research directly to patient\u000d      wellbeing and hospital economics, we have established strong links with\u000d      regional hospital trusts through our Centre for Advanced Cardiology\u000d      Research, which hosts cardiologist McEneaney as a Visiting Professor. We\u000d      have established international collaboration through MoUs and formal\u000d      agreements with e.g. Partners Healthcare (Massachusetts General, USA);\u000d      CIMIT (Boston) and many other international hospitals. All of this leads\u000d      to device adoption and the saving of lives which benefits this region\u000d      significantly. This impact was highlighted recently at the Ulster Business\u000d      Festival and Investment Conference, chaired by McLaughlin.\u000d    Much of the work at Intelesens and Heartsine has been validated by the\u000d      EPSRC IRC MATCH Centre (Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology Centre\u000d      for Health) (BM) and published work demonstrates up to 30% cost savings\u000d      associated with syncope patients and in the case of AED's key algorithms\u000d      save the lives of up to 20% more patients [10]. Similar high impact\u000d      studies have been highlighted in the MATCH Impact Final Report in which Dr\u000d      Mary Jo Kurth of Randox (www.randox.com)\u000d      highlighted \"The work that MATCH-NIBEC carried out has been critical in\u000d      demonstrating the value of the diagnostic test and has been widely used in\u000d      sales presentations and in Randox brochures thus enhancing our sales.\" The\u000d      impact of NIBEC research in Connected Health related disciplines can be\u000d      summarised as follows:\u000d    \u000d      Over 150 jobs created across the three NIBEC Connected Health spin-out\u000d        companies, over &#163;37m of investment and in excess of &#163;30m sales per year.\u000d      Low cost technology for critical care use which saves many lives\u000d        annually (estimated to be hundreds per year), improves the quality of\u000d        life, especially for the elderly and cuts costs.\u000d      Enhanced global interest in the possibility of home and hospital based\u000d        wireless monitoring (e.g. GE Healthcare, Intel investments and 5 recent\u000d        inward investments)\u000d      Technology uptake by the Wellcome Trust, UK Government, CIMIT (Boston)\u000d        and various companies as exemplars of the future of healthcare sensor\u000d        systems.\u000d      New funding and business models are being established which involve\u000d        strategic partnering with multi-national companies (e.g. GE Healthcare,\u000d        Intel); best practice techniques for model clinical agreements;\u000d        platforms for faster FDA and CE approval and encouraging the high\u000d        quality staff to continuously re-train and develop.\u000d      Moulded the shape of NI Government Strategies, through MATRIX and NI\u000d        Innovation Strategy panels and inspired a unique MoU between Department\u000d        of Health (NI) and Department of Enterprise and Trade in NI.\u000d    \u000d    Our research has highlighted the value of tri-lateral partnerships with\u000d      industry (local and international) and clinicians which will establish\u000d      market and clinical roadmaps for each product family along with field\u000d      testing and rapid feedback.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    NIBEC connected health related research over the past 20 years has led to\u000d      three high value spin- out companies.

Innovations in medical technology can offer a cost effective\u000d      solution in many areas, in particular reducing the labour and resource\u000d      burden of routine medical observations, as demonstrated through our large\u000d      MATCH projects [5]. Our research has led to a direct impact in this area\u000d      through the commercialisation of miniaturised medical devices with remote,\u000d      wireless, patient monitoring capability.\u000d    Following the pioneering work of Pantridge, Adgey and Anderson in mobile\u000d      coronary care with the invention of the world's first mobile\u000d      defibrillator, research collaboration over 20 years at Ulster between\u000d      McLaughlin in sensors, Anderson (d. 2012) in medical electronics and\u000d      McAdams (Ulster until 2009, currently ENSA-France) in medical electrodes\u000d      has resulted in the successful development of medical sensors [1], and\u000d      electro-stimulation devices with over 35 patents licensed.\u000d    Our work on developing novel low impedance silver - silver chloride [2]\u000d      colloid inks customised for flexible substrates [3, 6] and incorporating\u000d      patented annular designs led to an innovative low cost manufacturing\u000d      technique that was licensed to Tyco (1998 - 2012) and created the world's\u000d      largest selling disposable ECG electrode [4]. On the basis of this\u000d      technology, a spin out company NIRAD Ltd (later Meridian Medical and then\u000d      Heartscape) was established in 1986. Subsequent NIBEC designs were\u000d      patented (1994 onwards) and exploited through Heartscape to create a range\u000d      of telemedicine products, including the Dry Electrode ECG monitor, a\u000d      Wallet Based ECG System and a dry-electrode Holter monitor. This\u000d      technology was subsequently licensed to one of the world's first Connected\u000d      Health companies, SHL Telemedicine Israel, and eventually to Philips\u000d      Healthcare.\u000d    Our research has expanded into the areas of pattern recognition,\u000d      integrated electronic systems and body worn Wi-Fi and was coupled to novel\u000d      body sensing techniques for vital signs monitoring based on our electrode\u000d      fabrication expertise. We focussed on reducing electrode impedance,\u000d      through Ag-AgCl plasma surface modification [2], and body motion artefacts\u000d      using a mixture of advanced microfabrication techniques, with a\u000d      manufacturing focus, and signal processing. For example, MAFF and EU\u000d      funding supported the development of electrode micro-needles and\u000d      implantable electrodes that were subsequently patented and licensed to Air\u000d      Products in 2008.\u000d    McLaughlin (currently CTO), Anderson (d. 2012) and McAdams founded\u000d      Intelesens in 2001 in order to exploit their research and develop products\u000d      based on the integration of robust algorithms for arrhythmia and motion\u000d      detection along with impedance-based monitoring of temperature and\u000d      respiration patterns that utilises a miniaturised wireless (Wi-Fi)\u000d      chest-worn platform. Since then other patented products have been\u000d      developed, e.g. chest-worn integrated optics for SpO2\u000d      monitoring, PVDF pulse wave velocity sensors and electronic nose type gas\u000d      sensor technology.\u000d    Our research into advanced medical products based around low impedance\u000d      electrodes [6], reduced ECG lead sets with associated signal processing\u000d      and integrated RF electronics was funded through a range of sources such\u000d      as MRC (PRIME - ECG), EPSRC [5], Wellcome Trust [6], NASA, INI, TSB and\u000d      joint NSF(US)-SFI(Irl)-DEL(NI) grants.

McIlhagger and now led by Dr A. McIlhagger\u000d      (2008). R McIlhagger was an original pioneer in the field of composites\u000d      and championed their research and development within the major aircraft\u000d      companies, where eventually his ideas took hold. ECRE has continued and\u000d      built upon his work and is now nationally and internationally recognised\u000d      as a leader in the design and manufacture of advanced textile preforms,\u000d      advanced composites and in the development of associated manufacturing and\u000d      analysis processes.\u000d    Weaving technology is increasingly being used to produce dry\u000d      multi-layered preforms that are subsequently infused with a liquid matrix\u000d      material to produce high performance composites. Three dimension (3D)\u000d      woven composites, in particular, have been shown to possess many\u000d      advantages compared to traditional preforming methods with the ability to\u000d      tailor fibre placement in the X-, Y-, and Z-axis directions. Manufacturing\u000d      and performance advantages include, for example, improvements in\u000d      compression-after-impact (CAI) strength compared with two-dimensional (2D)\u000d      laminated composites and the ability to produce `near-net-shape' preforms.\u000d      The 3D woven composites produced at ECRE exhibit crack propagation values\u000d      an order of magnitude greater than 2D woven structures and therefore a\u000d      significantly higher resistance to delamination growth (AMcI, EA, JQ).\u000d    ECRE has attracted significant funding from Centre of Excellence\u000d      Programmes and collaborative industry &#8212; Invest NI partnerships to\u000d      undertake industrially focussed materials research into structural\u000d      composites, the simulation and modelling of 3D woven fabrics and the\u000d      investigation of composites manufacturing through pilot process\u000d      development [1-4] as well as involvement in industrially-led programmes in\u000d      the design and manufacture of preforms [5]. Associated avenues of research\u000d      include collaboration with Rolls Royce via DEL CAST Awards on the\u000d      modelling and integration of sensing technologies and the development of\u000d      hybrid structures (metallic and thermoplastic yarns) in collaboration with\u000d      the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, Sheffield University\/Boeing.\u000d      Through a Bombardier sponsored PhD programme, and in collaboration with\u000d      Nanotechnology groups at Ulster, ECRE has undertaken research on the\u000d      incorporation of new nanomaterials (e.g. carbon nanotubes, nanoclays and\u000d      graphene) into the composite matrix and our composite design and\u000d      manufacturing experience has been transferred into the field of\u000d      bio-composites. ECRE research expertise in fibre preparation and 3D\u000d      weaving for tailored preform manufacture has expanded into the use of\u000d      alternative fibres such as carbon, glass, basalt and polymeric fibres\u000d      (including aramid, UHMWPE) and the use of natural fibres including wool,\u000d      flax and viscose rayon for the production of 3D woven textile\u000d      reinforcements aimed at the automotive and construction sectors. More\u000d      recently this has developed into designing, developing and manufacturing\u000d      textile structures for the defence industry through DSTL supported PhD\u000d      programmes and private venture funding. The translation of research\u000d      outputs into industrial uptake and the study of commercial feasibility is\u000d      a core philosophy of the group. Examples of recent activities include a\u000d      funded Proof of Concept study into the commercial viability of the reuse\u000d      of carbon fibre and thermoplastic materials and, in partnership with\u000d      Bombardier, research and development of the latest advanced preforming\u000d      processes based on spatially reinforced composites (SpaRC). This was\u000d      funded through the InvestNI managed SpaRC LLP commercial programme.\u000d    The Advanced Metal Forming Research (AMFoR) Group at Ulster is at the\u000d      forefront of materials characterisation and modelling for the sheet metal\u000d      forming industries and has a close working relationship with international\u000d      aerospace manufacturers. This has led to mutually beneficial advancement\u000d      in understanding of mechanical metallurgy and forming processes. The group\u000d      has established a unique laboratory within the EU, combining conventional\u000d      and special purpose test equipment. AMFoR works collaboratively with\u000d      leading researchers in the field of metallic formability and with European\u000d      aerospace manufacturers, including Bombardier Aerospace and CERTETA\u000d      (Romania), providing a unique blend of capabilities including mathematical\u000d      modelling of plasticity, mechanical metallurgy along with materials\u000d      characterisation and industrial forming process optimisation. It\u000d      collaborates with ECRE to investigate and exploit synergies in modelling\u000d      e.g. modelling individual grains [6].\u000d    In response to the complex interactions observed while solving industrial\u000d      forming problems, AMFoR has developed a rare approach in the field of\u000d      applied metal forming that involves a mix of curiosity led scientific\u000d      research and pragmatic engineering. The introduction and exploitation of\u000d      fundamental materials characterisation for industrial sheet metal forming\u000d      materials and process development remains a strategic objective of the\u000d      group (AL).\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"999","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    AVX Ulster has had on-going links with AVX Ltd for over 25 years\u000d      with the company funding research, providing PhD studentships and offering\u000d      industrial support for numerous collaborative R&amp;D projects. Most\u000d      recently (2009), NIBEC and AVX commenced a large scale project to improve\u000d      the quality of the dielectric layers in the Multi-Layer Ceramic Capacitors\u000d      (MLCC) that the company produce in millions of units per day. This project\u000d      was highly successful with major improvements in nanoparticle dispersion\u000d      which the company have now fully integrated by into their volume\u000d      production lines (including Czech Republic).

This project has already identified\u000d      improvements in BME ink formulation and processing. [text removed for\u000d      publication]. This has arisen due to the direction and outputs achieved\u000d      from the materials characterisation and the understanding associated with\u000d      electrical characterisation of both raw materials and devices. Improved\u000d      control of de-agglomeration and dispersion of barium titanate powders and\u000d      metal oxide dopants along with feedback from nanoscale measurement and\u000d      characterisation data (impedance analysis, dispersion and binder-particle\u000d      interaction) have allowed the company to greatly enhance their\u000d      manufacturing processes [1, 4].

This work has led to an\u000d      expansion of SiSaf to seven staff, increased laboratory space and\u000d      enhancement of their patent, IP and knowledge assets. High quality silicon\u000d      nanoparticles (50-100nm) are routinely batch-produced, functionalised,\u000d      doped with drugs and characterised for trials and marketing samples to\u000d      customers.\u000d    This interaction has already led to a better understanding of the\u000d      fundamental properties of Si nanoparticles, its dependence of the\u000d      formulation route and a more efficient processing protocol. The research\u000d      has directly impacted on the valuation of the company with NIBEC staff\u000d      producing key reports and know-how in a number of important areas, namely:\u000d      the nature, size and surface characteristics of the 50 nm silicon\u000d      nanoparticles; three technical reports on the scale-up viability for\u000d      nanoparticle production via (i) arc deposition, (ii) via - milling and\u000d      (iii) via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) for production of smaller\u000d      particles. Biocompatibility (and in particular nano-toxicity) has been\u000d      investigated by NIBEC and a technical report issued which has impacted\u000d      beneficially on investor confidence through our findings of non-toxicity\u000d      which would have been a major barrier to full commercialisation. The\u000d      company now has a valuation of &#163;3.5m and is completing a set of &#163;1.5m\u000d      human trials in the USA to determine the suitability of the product for\u000d      topical application. It has a Silicon Valley office at ITLG with John\u000d      Hartnett as lead investor along with IUL, Crescent Capital and a set of\u000d      private angels [7,8]. The impact of having NIBEC team on board is\u000d      significant and the following points were key to improving the company's\u000d      overall value: nanoparticle fabrication (via plasma, CVD, wet etching and\u000d      milling); nanoparticle characterisation via HRTEM, dynamic light\u000d      scattering and zeta potential dispersion analysis, pharmaokinetics and\u000d      nanotoxicity testing with human cell lines [2]. In summary the company is\u000d      in a strong position, with over &#163;2m of investment to date and with Human\u000d      Clinical trials near completion, Suzanne Siebert (CEO) has said\u000d        \"NIBEC's impact on the company has been critical, and as we develop even\u000d        stronger international relationships in India, USA and throughout\u000d        Europe, these engineers, who underpin our work are highly important\u000d        partners\".\u000d    SEAGATE: In 1994 the then core nanotechnology team at NIBEC, in\u000d      conjunction with colleagues in QUB and local government agencies, were\u000d      instrumental in attracting Seagate Technologies to locate a major\u000d      production facility in the UK (in competition with South America, eastern\u000d      Europe and Asia). The subsequent NIBEC relationships with Seagate R&amp;D\u000d      in both the UK and the USA were developed around nanoscale coatings of\u000d      diamond-like carbon on a new generation of GMR read-write head devices.\u000d      The NIBEC team utilised a novel plasma immersion technique called Filtered\u000d      Cathodic Vacuum Arc (FCVA) that was developed in conjunction with Veeco\u000d      Instruments (USA). This, along with our development of specific metrology\u000d      protocols for analysing AlTiC ceramics, led to ultra-hard layers (30 GPa)\u000d      with a credible measured thickness of 1.5nm, the world's thinnest\u000d      continuous carbon coatings [3].

The\u000d      ultimate result was a read-write head with a significantly increased iron\u000d      content and a reduction in head-disc flying-height (due to the protective\u000d      nature of the dense carbon layer). [text removed for publication].\u000d      Seagate, in conjunction with InvestNI, invested over &#163;5m in three key\u000d      projects associated with the augmentation of this initial work, from 1996\u000d      to 2009. NIBEC and Seagate are currently planning a new programme of\u000d      engagement in the area of Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording with a focus on\u000d      our proven nanomaterials capability [3].\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Nanomaterials research at Ulster into materials including diamond-like\u000d      carbon (DLC) ultra-thin films, carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene, silicon\u000d      and metal oxide nanoparticles has resulted in direct uptake by major\u000d      industrial manufacturers and led to a directly quantifiable socio-economic\u000d      impact via added value, improved efficiencies and cost-savings and has\u000d      secured or increased the employment of skilled engineering staff.

We have an established track record in the preparation,\u000d      analysis and processing of materials including diamond-like carbon (DLC),\u000d      carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene, and various nanoparticle systems (Si,\u000d      group IV alloys, ferroelectric ceramics, and metal oxides). This area has\u000d      received substantial support from EPSRC, the Royal Society, the EU\u000d      Framework Programmes (FP4 - FP7) and InvestNI in collaboration with and\/or\u000d      through direct funded from industry (Seagate, AVX, SiSaf, Intel,\u000d      Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Schrader Electronics, Analog Devices, TFX Medical,\u000d      Medtronic, Labcoat, Kelvatech, Randox). The strategic aim of this research\u000d      is to advance the understanding of nanomaterials for device fabrication\u000d      and to promote its integration into advanced industrial manufacture [5].\u000d      The associated publications highlight our expertise in fabrication &amp;\u000d      advanced characterisation that led to direct industry impact (PP, PM, PL).\u000d    A number of targeted equipment grants have led to the creation of one of\u000d      the most advanced academic nanomaterials research facilities in Europe\u000d      (&#163;15m of capital investment in the last 10 years from SRIF, RCIF, DEL,\u000d      EPSRC)[6]. Recent highlights include novel equipment for the creation of\u000d      ultra-thin carbon\/CNT\/graphene films, a nanoparticle production laboratory\u000d      and advanced characterisation based on our new HRTEM. Our fundamental\u000d      strengths have centred on; (i) advancing metrology for measuring\u000d      nano-scale hardness, film thickness, internal stress and adhesive strength\u000d      on ultra-thin (1-50nm) carbon layers; (ii) nanoparticle fabrication (via\u000d      laser, microplasma, milling and wet chemical synthesis) and\u000d      characterisation of both the materials and the synthesis processes; (iii)\u000d      nano-scale surface-engineering and functionalisation with associated\u000d      high-resolution analysis (HRTEM, ToF-SIMS, XPS). The recently established\u000d      &#163;2m nanoparticle laboratory is key to the synthesis, characterisation and\u000d      understanding the unique properties of dispersed nanoparticles and it has\u000d      attracted industry (AVX, Bombardier, SiSaf and Randox) to support our\u000d      research.\u000d    For material synthesis, our primary strength is in plasma-based\u000d      deposition, surface engineering and functionalization. We have at hand a\u000d      large number of plasma systems operating from DC up to microwave\u000d      frequencies and from vacuum to atmospheric pressure. We host advanced\u000d      pilot-scale industrial systems supplied through collaboration with\u000d      equipment manufacturers. These include a custom-built microwave plasma\u000d      system (Seiki, Japan), which was the world's first system for the\u000d      deposition of highly oriented nanotubes [1- 3] and a FCVA - filtered\u000d      cathodic vacuum arc system (NTI Technologies, Singapore) for the\u000d      deposition of hydrogen-free highly diamond-like carbons for Seagate. The\u000d      research groups involved have also designed and constructed a suite of\u000d      advanced multi-functional plasma systems in-house, including pilot\u000d      (reel-reel) production systems with integrated specialist diagnostic tools\u000d      for concurrent measurement of plasma and material properties during the\u000d      growth of nanoparticles.

In-house materials\u000d      characterisation is complemented by access to international synchrotron\u000d      (Daresbury, Diamond, CERN) and neutron diffraction (Rutherford Appleton)\u000d      facilities via numerous CCLRC and EU awards.\u000d    We have secured funding for 15 projects related to nanomaterials and of\u000d      these, two major research awards, totalling &#163;1.6m since 2008, involve\u000d      collaboration with AVX Ltd (TB, PL). The research aims to link\u000d      fundamental ceramic nanoparticle properties to industrial processing\u000d      conditions. The resultant impact on the electrical and reliability\u000d      characteristics of multi-layer capacitor devices has allowed the company\u000d      to develop a new generation of high value products. Core elements of this\u000d      work along with the processing expertise developed are now also being\u000d      targeted at the development of ceramic\/clay fillers for Bombardier.\u000d    SiSaf Ltd are a 2009 spin-in company with NIBEC staff on the board\u000d      as CSO\/Director. A collaborative research venture with NIBEC aims to\u000d      produce and functionalise nanoparticle silicon for use in drug and\u000d      therapeutic transdermal delivery applications (TB, JMcL, BM). This work\u000d      relies on the provision of high-quality and precisely controlled 50nm\u000d      particles of Si with defined porosity\/surface properties in order to allow\u000d      specific functionalisation and drug attachment. This has involved in-vitro\u000d      testing of Si particle nano-toxicity at the NIBEC Cell Culture Facility\u000d      (BM). The data has provided the platform for a vitamin C dissolution study\u000d      in an animal model which indicated that the SiSaf delivery system is 30%\u000d      better than a standard drug delivery system. Current studies are examining\u000d      the use of nano-silicon for transdermal therapeutic delivery involving a\u000d      USA based human clinical trial. SiSaf won the 2010 Award for Most\u000d      Promising Technology at the Irish Technology Leadership Group (ITLG)\u000d      awards ceremony in Silicon Valley, USA.\u000d    The majority of the carbon-based ultra-thin film and nanoparticles work\u000d      commenced in 2000 arising from the burgeoning global interest in\u000d      diamond-like carbon (DLC), carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene for\u000d      electrical, optical and mechanical applications (PM, PP JMcL). Our\u000d      research was guided in the main via company initiated collaborations with\u000d      Seagate Technology, Daewoo Electronics and TFX Medical [4,\u000d      6]. Each company had a particular requirement for ultra- thin, low\u000d      friction, dense (pin-hole free) and durable films of 1 nm (Seagate) - 20\u000d      nm (TFX) in thickness. The experience gained in delivering the challenging\u000d      specifications set down by these globally leading companies provided the\u000d      model for the NIBEC technology transfer process and it is currently\u000d      focussed on the controlled growth and properties of CNT arrays for\u000d      biomedical and biosensor applications. Original work in the application of\u000d      CNTs has led to the development of inventive electrochemical platforms for\u000d      bio-sensing applications, several of which are now patent protected. Also\u000d      a spin-out company, Graphene International Ltd (2012) has recently\u000d      been established by PP with patents and licenses in the area of graphene\u000d      production scale-up.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2782","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Overall, our work has demonstrated that fire toxicity can be replicated\u000a      on a bench scale, using the steady state tube furnace apparatus (SSTF).\u000a      This method was adopted by ISO as a technical specification in 2007 (ISO\u000a      TS 19700); Prof Hull has been ISO Project Leader since 2004. This\u000a      is a publicly available document and, now the interlaboratory\u000a      reproducibility has been demonstrated, is currently (2013) published as\u000a      ISO\/FDIS 19700 (final draft international standard) due to be published as\u000a      ISO 19700 in 2014. This provides the first robust framework for the\u000a      realistic bench-scale quantification of fire effluent toxicity as a\u000a      function of fire condition. As the major killer, and major source of\u000a      injury in fires, this provides the vital tool for improving fire safety.\u000a      Some industries (for example the glass and mineral wool insulation, and\u000a      electric cable industries) have recognised the importance of fire\u000a      toxicity, supported our research, and are using it to market products of\u000a      greater fire safety. Recently, we have used the SSTF to show that\u000a      phosphorus based fire retardants are much safer than the brominated\u000a      materials they replace4, of great\u000a      interest to their manufacturer, Clariant, and the environmental groups\u000a      concerned about brominated flame retardants.\u000a    The adoption of performance based design by fire regulators, as an\u000a      adaptable strategy to free designers from the inappropriateness of\u000a      specific regulations that have no significant fire safety benefit,\u000a      includes a requirement to estimate the available safe escape time. This is\u000a      the time between detection of a fire and the safe evacuation of occupants.\u000a      The toxic product concentration along the escape route must be low enough\u000a      not to hinder or prevent escape. This requires prediction using robust\u000a      data on toxic product yields as a function of fire condition, and so far\u000a      the SSTF has proved the only apparatus capable of providing such data. In\u000a      addition, the SSTF provides regulators with a tool to quantify hazards,\u000a      and if necessary to restrict the use of the most dangerous materials in\u000a      the highest risk applications (e.g. mass transport, high rise buildings,\u000a      electrical and electronic components etc.)\u000a    Closer regulation of fire toxicity has saved lives, and forced industry\u000a      to replace dangerous products with safer materials; the progressive\u000a      switch-over from PVC to \"zero-halogen\" cables across Europe is the\u000a      clearest example. Meanwhile, for many years, the older products will\u000a      remain installed and sometimes in use, making it very difficult to\u000a      quantify the benefit in terms of reduced fire deaths and injuries. Thus,\u000a      while there is a clear societal benefit to reducing the toxicity of fires,\u000a      the short term cost has to be offset against the longer term benefits of\u000a      better designed materials and products (from which there is generally\u000a      greater profit) as well as improved fire safety. Industries already\u000a      manufacturing fire safe products, such as the zero-halogen cable and\u000a      mineral and glass wool insulation industries have been the immediate\u000a      beneficiaries in terms of increased sales.\u000a    One of the most tangible current outcomes has been the introduction of\u000a      the acidity classification in the European Construction Products\u000a      Regulation (305\/2011\/EU &#8212; CPR) &#8212; requiring all cables in Euroclasses B, C\u000a      and D to be classified according to the hazardous properties of gases\u000a      developed in the event of fire, which \"compromise the ability of the\u000a      persons exposed to them to take effective action to accomplish escape\",\u000a      allowing users to discriminate between high toxicity (PVC) and low\u000a      smoke\/zero halogen (LSZH), low fire toxicity cables. This is illustrated\u000a      below, showing the acidity of the effluent as 0.15 measured by the EN\u000a      50267-2-3 regulatory test (a lower pH value means greater least toxic\u000a      acidity; cables with pH&lt;4.3 do not meet the 0.05 low hazard \"acidity\u000a      classification\"), against the toxicity (quantified using ISO 19700\u000a      expressed as Fractional Effective Dose &#8212; the higher the value, the greater\u000a      the toxicity). This clearly shows the relationship between the acidity\u000a      classification and the toxicity, was presented in the IWCS paper, and was\u000a      used to persuade the regulators of the need to introduce such as\u000a      classification in the Construction Products Regulation (2011), which came\u000a      into force across Europe in 2013.

While deaths and injuries from burns (80% of total in 1955)\u000a      showed a modest increase, deaths and particularly injuries from inhaling\u000a      toxic smoke increased rapidly, and continued to rise until 2000 (over 50%\u000a      of total in 2011). Eventually, the rise was attributed to the increased\u000a      use of synthetic polymers, especially polyurethane foam furnishings.\u000a      Although much work was undertaken from 1980-1995, the difficulty of\u000a      replicating this toxicity on a bench-scale meant that investigation of\u000a      fire toxicity could only be achieved using large scale fire tests\u000a      (prohibitively expensive). Instead, efforts in fire safety focussed on\u000a      reductions in ignitability and heat release, rather than the toxicity of\u000a      effluent. Moreover, as coroners require evidence that fire was not used to\u000a      cover-up murder, and that the victims of fire were breathing at the time\u000a      of the fire, they quantify carbon monoxide inhalation as blood\u000a      carboxyhaemoglobin concentration. Unfortunately, this data has been used\u000a      to support the erroneous conclusion that carbon monoxide (which forms\u000a      carboxyhaemoglobin) is the only significant toxicant present in\u000a      fire effluents1\u000a    As a fire grows, it becomes ventilation controlled and the yields of\u000a      toxic products (especially carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide) increase\u000a      by factors of between 10 and 50. Most bench-scale fire apparatuses cannot\u000a      replicate these under-ventilated fires as too much radiant heat from the\u000a      flame is lost to the surroundings and the test fire is extinguished when\u000a      the oxygen concentration falls. The steady state tube furnace was designed\u000a      specifically to replicate each stage of fire growth in order to quantify\u000a      fire effluent toxicity under all conditions, including the most toxic\u000a      under-ventilated conditions, by surrounding the flames in a high\u000a      temperature, high radiant flux environment.\u000a    From the initial concept, by UCLan's visiting Prof Purser, (then based at\u000a      the UK's Fire Research Station, now BRE Fire and Security), the\u000a      development of the steady state tube furnace (SSTF) was led by Prof Hull,\u000a      based at UCLan from September 2007. In October 2007, Dr Stec was\u000a      appointed to a Lectureship, then Readership at UCLan, to lead the\u000a      development of the fire toxicity research. In addition to the SSTF\u000a      development, she quantified the fire toxicity of many important materials;\u000a      recognised the importance of particulates in toxicity; identified the need\u000a      to obtain more large-scale validation data to correlate against behaviour\u000a      observed in the steady state tube furnace; and set-up the Large\u000a      Instrumented Fire Enclosure (LIFE) facility to achieve this, at Lancashire\u000a      Fire and Rescue Service's Washington Hall Training Centre. This led to\u000a      further funding from EPSRC (&#163;125k) to understand the problems of fire\u000a      toxicity in real fires.\u000a    The first breakthrough came when the group rationalised the toxic product\u000a      yields from burning polymers as a function of stoichiometric equivalence\u000a      ratio. They then developed the realistic bench scale measurement of fire\u000a      toxicity, from bespoke research equipment to international standard. They\u000a      have over 60 publications on the subject. In May 20102\u000a      their book, \"Fire Toxicity\" was recognised as the \"best currently\u000a      available understanding and application of fire toxicity\"3\u000a      by the editor of the Journal of Fire Sciences.\u000a    This research has:\u000a    \u000a      Developed, and characterised a method for replicating large scale fire\u000a        behaviour on a bench scale.\u000a      Established relationships between fire effluent toxicity, material\u000a        composition, temperature and ventilation conditions for a wide variety\u000a        of materials.\u000a      Investigated the effect of fire retardants and nanofillers on fire\u000a        effluent toxicity.\u000a      Developed a methodology for separation and analysis of soot particles\u000a        from fire effluents.\u000a      Established a unique (LIFE) facility at Lancashire Fire and Rescue\u000a        Service's Washington Hall Training Centre, for investigation of large\u000a        scale fire behaviour.\u000a      Demonstrated the validity of the approach by monitoring effluent\u000a        toxicity from the real fires in domestic houses (prior to scheduled\u000a        demolition).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3921","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Economic impact\u000a    The value of the electronics manufacturing industry worldwide is ~US$2tn;\u000a      Europe accounts for ~20% of this.

The project helped to establish MicroStencil Ltd, a\u000a      spin-out company formed to commercialise the low cost and high precision\u000a      electroforming technology developed from the project. MicroStencil has\u000a      recently moved to Singapore to be closer to its customer base and entered\u000a      a partnership with DEK Printing Machines Ltd, a world leading stencil\u000a      printing equipment manufacturer, to produce a new brand of stencils.\u000a    The university's work supported the successful implementation of Ball\u000a      Grid Array (BGA) semiconductor packaged components for Tranche 2 of the\u000a      radar signal processor for the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft.

Our work in assessing the manufacturing processes and\u000a      subsequent reliability of electronic components using material\u000a      replacements such as Tin-Silver-Copper solders has helped our industry\u000a      partners meet these challenges, as well as avoid the placement of harmful\u000a      materials such as lead in landfill. Although RoHS only applied to certain\u000a      sectors (eg high reliability sectors have an opt-out), the use of\u000a      commercial lead-free components in high reliability systems means that\u000a      most sectors have had to abide with the RoHS legislation.

It predicts how multi-component, multi-material systems will\u000a      behave in myriad situations including variations in temperature, pressure,\u000a      vibration, humidity, and over time. A central theme of the work is\u000a      multi-physics process modelling and physics of failure reliability\u000a      analysis of Microsystems (micro-electronics, power electronics, MEMS,\u000a      etc).\u000a    A) Design for manufacture\u000a     Research began in 1998 when we developed multi-physics models to predict\u000a      the assembly of semiconductor dies onto printed circuit boards &#8212; the so\u000a      called flip-chip assembly process [3a]. Due to EU environmental\u000a      legislation (Reduction of Hazardous Substances) there was an urgent need\u000a      to extend our work to investigate lead-free solder assembly which we\u000a      achieved for both Tin-Silver-Copper solders [3b] and Conductive Adhesives\u000a      [3c]. These projects sought to enable high-volume production of the next\u000a      generation of intelligent products, eg mobile phones, visual display\u000a      equipment and medical devices, by providing industry with a process using\u000a      appropriate microsystems technologies. We developed computational\u000a      modelling techniques (eg through our multi-physics software tool PHYSICA)\u000a      and advanced materials analysis which identified a process route\u000a      to integrate microsystems-based components using low cost flip chip\u000a      assembly, and adopt microsystems technology such as UV-LIGA to manufacture\u000a      stencils with ultra-fine apertures in order to print solders and adhesive\u000a      materials onto a substrate ant sub-100um pitch [3.1, 3.2]. These results\u000a      were used by our industrial partners Henkel, Celestica, MicroEmmisive\u000a      Displays, and DEK Printing Machines to implement the technologies.\u000a    Using our modelling expertise we have also worked with a number of\u000a      companies to assess the impact of manufacturing processes and product\u000a      design on the performance of electronic systems for the high reliability\u000a      aerospace sector. Examples include the project ENDVIEW (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1aXpPok)\u000a      [3d] where we used our modelling techniques to predict optimal heat sink\u000a      designs, and LED backlight designs for ruggedized displays for use in\u000a      harsh sunlight environments. The results from our work have allowed\u000a      GE-Aviation to optimise these new LED displays for cockpit environments.\u000a      In addition to this we have been supported by the US Government [3e] and\u000a      aerospace companies such as Selex-ES, Rolls Royce, Micross Semiconductors,\u000a      and General Dynamics (USA) to assess the performance of a robotic\u000a      controlled process that refinishes lead-free components so that they are\u000a      suitable for high reliability applications (eg submarines, avionics, etc)\u000a      [3.3].\u000a    B) Design for reliability\u000a    Design for manufacture aims to ensure the microsystem developed from\u000a      manufacturing is of high quality. The next step is to assess how reliable\u000a      this component will be. We have used the physics of failure approach to\u000a      predicting reliability of microsystems. For example with regards to\u000a      lead-free solders and conductive adhesives, we have assessed the\u000a      reliability of these interconnects particularly at sub-100um pitch [3.4].\u000a      This capability has led on to many consultancy projects with industry. For\u000a      example consultancy work with Selex-Electronics Systems has used our\u000a      expertise to predict the reliability of solder joints, and assessment of\u000a      underfill materials for the radar signal processor used for the\u000a      Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft [3.5].\u000a    Our expertise has also been used in developing physics of failure\u000a      reliability models for power electronics components &#8212; particularly\u000a      insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules. This started in 2005\u000a      through support from the Innovative Electronics Manufacturing Research\u000a      Centre (IeMRC http:\/\/bit.ly\/HbNs2Y)\u000a      for the Flagship Project in Power Electronics [3h]. Here we developed a\u000a      number of physics of failure reliability models for solders, wirebonds and\u000a      bussbars and demonstrated how these can be adopted in a prognostics and\u000a      health monitoring framework [3.6]. This work was also supported by\u000a      Department of Trade and Industry project &#8212; Modelling Power Modules (MPM)\u000a      [3i] which started the development of our software tool PowerLife which\u000a      embeds algorithms to calculate the reliability and robustness of power\u000a      modules. Working closely with our industrial partners such as SEMELAB and\u000a      Dynex Semiconductors we have further advanced this tool through the EU\u000a      project PEMREL [3j]. This tool is now used within both companies to\u000a      optimise designs of power modules before physical prototyping.\u000a    Key staff: Professor Chris Bailey - Director of the Computational\u000a      Mechanics and Reliability Group and project manager; group members include\u000a      Dr Stoyan Stoyanov (Reader), Dr Hua Lu (Reader); Dr Chunyan Yin\u000a      (Lecturer), Dr Nadia Strusevich (Lecturer), Dr Tim Tilford (Lecturer), Dr\u000a      Pushpa Rajaguru (Lecturer).

CSCAN, comprising staff from the\u000d\u000a      School of Computing and Mathematics at Plymouth University, have expertise\u000d\u000a      in IT security, communication and network technology and are specialists\u000d\u000a      in the design of efficient linear error correcting codes. The team is led\u000d\u000a      by Prof. Martin Tomlinson (Professor 1982-to date) and includes Dr. Marcel\u000d\u000a      Adrian Ambroze (Lecturer 2003-to date), Dr. Mohammed Zaki Ahmed (Lecturer\u000d\u000a      2001-2008, Senior Lecturer 2008-2010, Associate Professor 2010-to date)\u000d\u000a      and Dr. Cen Jung Tjhai (Lecturer 2007-2010).\u000d\u000a    The research published its first results in 2005 and commercial\u000d\u000a      translation began with through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with\u000d\u000a      Bombardier Transportation UK, Ltd. that ran for two years between\u000d\u000a      2006-2008. The company started in Plymouth in 1959 as ML Engineering, and\u000d\u000a      manufactures signalling systems for trains. Bombardier Transportation\u000d\u000a      designs, manufacturers, and delivers rail control and signalling solutions\u000d\u000a      at its Plymouth site. The research continues with a direct synergy between\u000d\u000a      the development of the research and its commercial application.\u000d\u000a    The research undertaken focused on the development of the latest\u000d\u000a      generation track circuit unit for rail control safety systems. Error\u000d\u000a      correcting codes are specified by the number of information symbols and\u000d\u000a      the number of codeword symbols. An efficient code is one that has the\u000d\u000a      largest distance between codewords for a given number of information\u000d\u000a      symbols and codeword symbols, with the best known codes normally published\u000d\u000a      [R5]. The research carried out at Plymouth has developed new codes that\u000d\u000a      were proven to be better for communications systems than previously used\u000d\u000a      codes.\u000d\u000a    The research created a coded track system that was substantially more\u000d\u000a      advanced than existing coded railway signalling. The Plymouth team\u000d\u000a      designed a very specific new error correcting code that was suitable for\u000d\u000a      the unique noise and interference challenges of the railway signalling\u000d\u000a      channel. This new error correcting code provided a very robust solution\u000d\u000a      that was subsequently the basis of the EBI Track 400 product. Part of the\u000d\u000a      on-going challenge after the KTP was to prove the safety case for the new\u000d\u000a      train detection system. This is a highly complex and important process\u000d\u000a      before a new system such as this is adopted for use, since it is safety\u000d\u000a      critical and lives depend upon its effective and constant operation in the\u000d\u000a      field. Dr Ahmed provided subsequent support in verifying the safety case\u000d\u000a      for the EBI Track 400 that was highly acclaimed by Network Rail [I9].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4595","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research team in Plymouth worked as part of a Knowledge Exchange\u000d\u000a      project with De La Rue to design a quality assurance system for specialist\u000d\u000a      security features used in their banknotes. The team designed, developed\u000d\u000a      and constructed a complete system to reliably detect and identify security\u000d\u000a      measures with a tolerance better than 5%. Such precision is currently\u000d\u000a      impossible to recreate in counterfeiting. The patented technology used in\u000d\u000a      the sensors was invented by Plymouth University academics and has also\u000d\u000a      been used to provide applied solutions for a number of other companies.\u000d\u000a    The University team worked to tight deadlines to meet De La Rue's\u000d\u000a      production start date for the manufacture of their new technology feature.\u000d\u000a      The project involved a combination of mechanical design, sophisticated\u000d\u000a      magnetic sensor design, electronic circuit design, and working in\u000d\u000a      partnership with another De La Rue subcontractor. The team have\u000d\u000a      successfully installed and commissioned working detection systems at the\u000d\u000a      De La Rue, Bolton &amp; Loughton sites.\u000d\u000a    This technology is highly confidential and subject to non-disclosure\u000d\u000a      contacts for much of the detail. The precise details of the implementation\u000d\u000a      cannot be described for these reasons. In outline, invisible encrypted\u000d\u000a      features are identified by specialist magnetic detectors precisely\u000d\u000a      designed to optimise the recovered signal from the security thread. These\u000d\u000a      heads are micro-fabricated in the Clean Room facility at Plymouth to\u000d\u000a      ensure maximum security. The recovered signal is decrypted using novel\u000d\u000a      information processing algorithms, also developed at Plymouth, to allow\u000d\u000a      the tiny signal to be reliably recognized with very low signal-to-noise\u000d\u000a      ratios. The latest evolution, included in all Euro and other banknotes,\u000d\u000a      allows innovative optical effects linked to more complex structures which\u000d\u000a      do not increase the production cost of the banknotes.\u000d\u000a    Specifically, the development with Plymouth has resulted in two\u000d\u000a      technologies, Magtext&#174; and MagForm&#8482; which are found on banknotes. The\u000d\u000a      University technology was applied specifically to the De La Rue\u000d\u000a      requirement and has resulted in a completely bespoke system which has now\u000d\u000a      provided quality assurance for over 5 billion banknotes. MagForm&#8482; can only\u000d\u000a      be identified on the expert level.

Potential future losses through\u000d\u000a      counterfeit have been mitigated by the improved quality assurance systems.\u000d\u000a      The new technology has been adopted by De La Rue, the world's largest\u000d\u000a      commercial currency printer and papermaker. This research has considerable\u000d\u000a      reach in that De la Rue is involved in the production of more than 150\u000d\u000a      currencies worldwide including the EURO. Almost half of all banknotes\u000d\u000a      issued into circulation in the past two years across the world were\u000d\u000a      created by De La Rue.\u000d\u000a    The technology is now used on all issued UK Bank of England notes. The\u000d\u000a      Bank of England has confirmed that \"Plymouth have developed a sensor\u000d\u000a        technology based around a novel structured magnetic read head to monitor\u000d\u000a        the quality in banknote production and fraud detection.

As counterfeiting\u000d\u000a      gets more sophisticated, more technological approaches are being adopted\u000d\u000a      to combat fraud.

The technique gives unique information on\u000d\u000a      the phase chemistry and microstructure of engineering materials. Under the\u000d\u000a      leadership of Smith and Cerezo in the UOA, two research themes have been\u000d\u000a      pursued since 1998:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      advances in the performance and capability of the Atom Probe\u000d\u000a        technique; and\u000d\u000a      advances in metallurgy and engineering materials based on the\u000d\u000a        application of the technique to a wide range of engineering problems.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Improvements in performance and capability resulting from research in the\u000d\u000a      UAO included the idea of incorporating a reflectron lens to improve mass\u000d\u000a      resolution by energy compensation of the extracted ions (European Patent\u000d\u000a      No. 0231247, International patent PCT\/ GB98\/02678 16\/09\/98; US patent\u000d\u000a      6,580,069 17\/06\/03). This innovation enabled the complete separation of\u000d\u000a      closely spaced mass peaks in spectra from complex alloys, and allowed the\u000d\u000a      precise analysis of engineering materials not possible in earlier\u000d\u000a      instrument designs [3.1]. Later, the UOA developed a movable extraction\u000d\u000a      electrode and the 3-wire delay-line detector to replace wedge and strip\u000d\u000a      anodes [3.2].

These two innovations improved the throughput\u000d\u000a      of samples and increased the data collection rate by a factor of more than\u000d\u000a      100. A final stage of development was the wide-angle reflectron (U.S.\u000d\u000a      patent 6,661,013, 09\/12\/03) that improved energy resolution in instruments\u000d\u000a      incorporating moving electrodes in the voltage pulsing mode.\u000d\u000a    The UOA also exploited these developments in the study of a wide range of\u000d\u000a      materials, generating more than 250 peer-reviewed papers. Key achievements\u000d\u000a      included the first 3DAP studies of titanium and uranium alloys,\u000d\u000a      investigation of precipitation reactions in commercial aluminium alloys\u000d\u000a      and atomic scale chemical studies of semiconductor and catalyst\u000d\u000a      nanostructures. A substantial body of work concerned precipitation\u000d\u000a      reactions in nuclear pressure vessel steels [3.3]; for instance, the UOA\u000d\u000a      published influential results on the nanoscale precipitation that\u000d\u000a      embrittles steels, contributing to safety cases for the Sizewell B\u000d\u000a      reactor.

In 1998 the company received Millennium Product\u000d\u000a      designation for the Energy Compensated Position Sensitive Atom Probe, and\u000d\u000a      this instrument was the forerunner of all commercial Atom Probe\u000d\u000a      Instruments.\u000d\u000a    Based on the strong IP position developed in the UOA, the company was\u000d\u000a      sold first to Polaron in 2002 and then in 2006 to Imago, now Ametek.\u000d\u000a      Research and development in the UOA has thus led directly to designs\u000d\u000a      critical for the performance of the current market-leading instrument, the\u000d\u000a      Ametek-CAMECA Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4957","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aIn addition to scientific expertise, Jones brought essential commercial and KT know-how to this\u000d\u000aimpact.

DSTL has a remit to ensure that the UK retains a\u000d\u000areliable and sovereign armour ceramics manufacturing base. Consequently, DSTL is a beneficiary\u000d\u000aof this impact since XeraCarb is the only supplier enabling it to meet this requirement [J].\u000d\u000aRecognising XeraCarb's position as an essential supplier for future UK armed forces capability,\u000d\u000aDSTL has awarded it a &#163;284k, 2-year contract [vi] to develop pressure-cast versions of the current\u000d\u000aUK armour system. This work will aim to achieve rapid manufacturing capability and improved\u000d\u000amaterial properties and consistency. Requests for trial materials have also been received from\u000d\u000aeight UK manufacturers of armour systems \/ armoured vehicles.

A number of alternative material\u000d\u000acompositions have been developed, targeted at applications for which cheaper and\/or more wear\u000d\u000aresistant materials are required. Trial wear-tiles have been placed with Broadbents Ltd, a major UK\u000d\u000amanufacturer which supplies centrifugal mineral dewatering machines globally. Wear- and high-temperature-corrosion-resistant grades have also been trialled by Omegaslate Ltd. Also, a\u000d\u000arefractory nozzle supplier (Melle Ltd) has requested design and manufacture of test nozzles for gas\u000d\u000aburner applications. A 15 month TSB SMART Proof of Concept award, with a project value of\u000d\u000a&#163;175k [v], has been won to develop and test further material grades suitable for a range of\u000d\u000aabrasive wear and refractory applications.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aXeraCarb Ltd is a spin-out company formed in 2011 to exploit a class of ceramic composite\u000d\u000amaterials co-invented by Jones.

In this role he has led a range of contract research projects to analyse and\u000d\u000aimprove the wear resistance of ceramics, coatings and other hard materials. Within this body of\u000d\u000awork, studies into the properties and performance of Si3N4- and SiAlON-based ceramic composites\u000d\u000a[1,2,3], two of which were submitted under his name to RAE2008, are pertinent to this case study:\u000d\u000athey underpin Jones' expertise in this field. He was promoted to Principal Research Fellow in 2009\u000d\u000aand has been at the University throughout the REF period.\u000d\u000aThe spin-out XeraCarb is founded on research IP, expertise and experience relating to novel\u000d\u000amaterial compositions and production processes. The materials involved are silicon carbide\u000d\u000aceramic composites in which an alloy of silicon nitride and aluminium oxide (SiAlON) is used as the\u000d\u000abinder phase. Jones developed these materials with Dr Anthony Pick, an experienced industrial\u000d\u000aceramicist, after the two met in 2008 at an outreach event within the Routes to Innovation (R2i)\u000d\u000aKnowledge Transfer (KT) programme (REF3a(b)). Pick had worked for 40 years in the industrial\u000d\u000aceramics and refractory industry, mostly in the production of silicon carbide refractory products. He\u000d\u000ahad been independently developing research ideas based on his experience prior to 2008.\u000d\u000aHowever, it was not until his ideas were combined with Jones' previous expertise in SiAlON-based\u000d\u000aceramic composites that the novel aspects underpinning this case study were developed.\u000d\u000aThe central novelty of Jones and Pick's research relates to the identification of appropriate\u000d\u000acombinations of SiC, SiAlON and sintering additives required to achieve enhanced materials\u000d\u000aproperties using low temperature (&lt;2000&#176; C) production methods. The key findings relate to\u000d\u000aceramic composites made through appropriate combination of SiC, Al2O3, Si3N4, and 5 other\u000d\u000aingredients, including rare earth sintering aids. These ceramics proved realisable using\u000d\u000aconventional (non-vacuum) furnaces at much lower temperatures than sintered SiC due to\u000d\u000autilisation of a reactive sintering route in which SiAlON forms in-situ from Si metal.\u000d\u000aThe initial feasibility study for this work was conducted in MERI by Jones and Pick in Jan-Mar\u000d\u000a2008 using a 3-month seed-corn grant [i] obtained from the R2i KT programme. This study\u000d\u000adetermined composite formulations which significantly out-performed pre-existing commercial\u000d\u000agrades of a similar composition (e.g. nitride bonded SiC) in terms of density, strength and Weibull\u000d\u000amodulus. Specifically, Jones and Pick developed new materials that were 10% less dense than\u000d\u000asintered SiC and 30% less dense than Al2O3, two conventional body-armour materials. Achieving\u000d\u000aequivalent performance with reduced component weight provides an obvious potential benefit in\u000d\u000athe context of body-armour panels for military personnel.\u000d\u000aThe results from the R2i feasibility project provided the basis for a 2009 UK MoD funding\u000d\u000aapplication. This led to a 6-month Centre for Defence Enterprise project [ii] conducted in MERI to\u000d\u000atest the viability of SiAlON\/SiC composites, made via reactive sintering, for use as lighter and\u000d\u000acheaper armour materials. After a positive evaluation, this was followed (2010) by a further 6-month project [iii] conducted in MERI to make prototype armour components for testing by the\u000d\u000aMoD's Defence Science &amp; Technology Laboratory (DSTL). This work explored routes by which the\u000d\u000anew materials could be produced in complex shapes and as large components. The materials\u000d\u000awere, thus, developed in such a way that they could be easily slip-cast with potential for pressure\u000d\u000acasting (a more efficient method for scale-up purposes). This proved a critical development in\u000d\u000aterms of commercial potential, since it made the materials significantly cheaper to produce than\u000d\u000asintered SiC and competitive with Al2O3. It also opened up a number of alternative applications\u000d\u000a(see section 4). A third 6-month project funded by DSTL (2012) examined the effects of\u000d\u000aincorporating hard phases (TiB2, c-BN, B4C) into the base composite materials [iv].\u000d\u000aIn order to protect the IP in this work, it was written up first in two patent applications [4,5]\u000d\u000asubmitted in Dec 2012. As set out in section 4, this timing and the use of patents rather than\u000d\u000arefereed papers in the open literature was a requirement for securing investment funding.\u000d\u000aOngoing research work, supported by a &#163;175k TSB SMART Proof of Concept award [v],\u000d\u000ainvolves developing and testing grades suitable for a range of abrasive wear and refractory\u000d\u000aapplications. Also, a new research programme on pressure casting, funded by a &#163;284k DSTL grant\u000d\u000a[vi] and &#163;100k of XeraCarb investment, started in Oct 2013 in partnership with the MoD and other\u000d\u000acommercial contractors.

Liquid Granite concentrates on fire retarding\u000d\u000a      applications, selling AAM-based precast\u000d\u000a      lintels meeting the highest fire resistance specification for fire plug\u000d\u000a      applications in buildings - total\u000d\u000a      sales in the REF period are &#163;109k (licence income &#163;5,455), including a\u000d\u000a      batch of AAM lintels\u000d\u000a      installed in 2012 Olympic village.\u000d\u000a    In 2012, C-Probe Ltd [H] took up a licence from SHU for a\u000d\u000a      customised version of AAMs,\u000d\u000a      concentrating on repair and corrosion protection of reinforced concrete\u000d\u000a      structures. This is based on\u000d\u000a      the electrically conducting version of AAMs and targeted at CP\u000d\u000a      applications [4], consistent with C-Probe's\u000d\u000a      other activities in the corrosion protection business and the\u000d\u000a      supply\/installation of CP\u000d\u000a      systems. The customised version of AAM was trialled at Leeds Civic Hall\u000d\u000a      (limestone clad steel\u000d\u000a      framed building), pending a contract exceeding &#163;100k.\u000d\u000a    LOVACS: The largest order achieved to date for LOVACS was by Laing\u000d\u000a        O'Rourke to cure\u000d\u000a      concrete during the Heathrow Terminal 5 construction.

In\u000d\u000a      1993 he brought with\u000d\u000a      him an EC-funded project [i] on expert systems for performance assessment\u000d\u000a      and optimum\u000d\u000a      inspection and maintenance strategies for concrete structures. This was\u000d\u000a      subsequently advanced at\u000d\u000a      SHU by research into the long term performance of concrete repair in\u000d\u000a      highway structures [ii]. The\u000d\u000a      key research developments from this work were: models for long-term\u000d\u000a      deterioration processes in\u000d\u000a      reinforced concrete, particularly chloride diffusion and reinforcement\u000d\u000a      corrosion [1]; equations for\u000d\u000a      the prediction of long-term residual strength and stiffness of corroding\u000d\u000a      members [2]; and methods\u000d\u000a      for characterising the interaction between repair patches and substrate\u000d\u000a      concrete in terms of\u000d\u000a      material properties and repair methods [3].\u000d\u000a    Mangat's research on deterioration remediation of concrete subsequently\u000d\u000a      diversified into\u000d\u000a      corrosion protection (CP) systems, which he developed with Dr Paul\u000d\u000a      Lambert, Technical Director of\u000d\u000a      Mott MacDonald and, since 2005, Visiting Professor at SHU. Collaborative\u000d\u000a      research between\u000d\u000a      Mangat and Lambert, supported by a Royal Society Industrial Fellowship to\u000d\u000a      Lambert [iii], initially\u000d\u000a      concentrated on numerical modelling of CP systems and their experimental\u000d\u000a      verification. This led to\u000d\u000a      development of optimum CP system designs for corroding reinforced concrete\u000d\u000a      and steel framed\u000d\u000a      masonry structures [4].\u000d\u000a    Having established expertise in concrete deterioration and repair, Mangat\u000d\u000a      was well placed to\u000d\u000a      identify the limitations of concrete repair materials and the inefficiency\u000d\u000a      of site curing methods with\u000d\u000a      respect to the durability of repair. This triggered the research that led\u000d\u000a      to his development of alkali\u000d\u000a      activated materials (AAMs) and low voltage accelerated curing system\u000d\u000a      (LOVACS).\u000d\u000a    Research on AAMs, was conducted between 1995 and 2004, supported by EU\u000d\u000a      funding [iv].\u000d\u000a      Initial research identified the principle of using inorganic alkali\u000d\u000a      material to activate waste-derived\u000d\u000a      reactive powders, thereby avoiding use of high CO2-producing\u000d\u000a      hydraulic cement. Subsequent\u000d\u000a      experimental investigations determined chemically optimised compositions\u000d\u000a      of multiple reactive\u000d\u000a      powders, filler and activator [5], so characterising the key parameters\u000d\u000a      governing properties such as\u000d\u000a      strength and durability. Further work developed admixtures capable of\u000d\u000a      giving control over AAM\u000d\u000a      setting time and shrinkage, thereby addressing practical considerations\u000d\u000a      such as placement,\u000d\u000a      compaction, on-site curing and long term durability. Formulations suitable\u000d\u000a      for different repair\u000d\u000a      methods were then developed through an EU Regional Development Scheme\u000d\u000a      grant. Subsequent\u000d\u000a      industrially-sponsored research [v] determined methodologies by which to\u000d\u000a      exploit the excellent\u000d\u000a      adhesive properties of AAMs to achieve dual function anode systems which\u000d\u000a      offer both CP and\u000d\u000a      structural strengthening to concrete structures. AAMs proved to be fire\u000d\u000a      resistant at temperatures\u000d\u000a      exceeding 1100&#176;C, significantly out-performing cement-based or\u000d\u000a      polymer-modified materials. The\u000d\u000a      former typically explode when heated towards 400&#176;C. As described in section\u000d\u000a        4, research\u000d\u000a      publications on AAMs were restricted in order to protect IP related to\u000d\u000a      this finding.\u000d\u000a    LOVACS, a novel conductive polymer technology, comprises a flexible\u000d\u000a      polymer-coated\u000d\u000a      textile membrane which, when appropriately incorporated, provides\u000d\u000a      accelerated and efficient curing\u000d\u000a      to in-situ repairs and to concrete construction in general, especially in\u000d\u000a      cold weather. LOVACS was\u000d\u000a      initiated through a Teaching Company Scheme (TCS) awarded to Inditherm\u000d\u000a        Plc and Mangat's\u000d\u000a      group at SHU in 2003, subsequent work being supported by EPSRC [vi] and EU\u000d\u000a      grants [vii]. The\u000d\u000a      research that underpins LOVACS started with the development of basic\u000d\u000a      relationships between the\u000d\u000a      composition\/thickness of the conductive polymer coating, the size and\u000d\u000a      spacing between electric\u000d\u000a      rails and the optimum size of the polymeric heating element. Subsequently,\u000d\u000a      relationships between\u000d\u000a      power input, the arrangement of the polymeric heating elements (in\u000d\u000a      parallel, series, with or without\u000d\u000a      common middle rail), and the heat output were determined, leading to\u000d\u000a      optimisation of curing\u000d\u000a      system designs for a range of specifications. For example, generic\u000d\u000a      relationships were derived by\u000d\u000a      determining the performance of polymer blankets with different power\u000d\u000a      ratings and configurations on\u000d\u000a      the curing efficiency of concrete elements and repair patches. From these,\u000d\u000a      it proved possible to\u000d\u000a      optimise the LOVACS curing parameters (power, temperature, time) for\u000d\u000a      production of a range of\u000d\u000a      durable cured materials and components. On the basis of this discovery, an\u000d\u000a      international patent [6]\u000d\u000a      was granted in 2005 to Mangat and Catley (the TCS associate) who went on\u000d\u000a      to achieve a PhD\u000d\u000a      (2009). Mangat's research activity in this field continues through an EU\u000d\u000a      grant to improve the quality\u000d\u000a      of concrete repairs using a novel accelerated microwave curing system\u000d\u000a      [viii].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4959","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In the REF impact period, the MERI modelling group's simulation expertise\u000d\u000a      has achieved economic impact through improved product and\u000d\u000a        process understanding. This range of outward-facing activities\u000d\u000a      undertaken by the group is illustrated here in the contexts of a small\u000d\u000a      company (Fluid Maintenance Solutions), an SME (ZBD Displays)\u000d\u000a      and a multinational (Kodak).\u000d\u000a    Fluid Maintenance Solutions (FMS) [A] is a\u000d\u000a      South-Yorkshire-Based small company specialising in the recovery of high\u000d\u000a      value metals contained within sump sludges. FMS's core activity is\u000d\u000a      a recycling process in which thin contaminant films of hydrocarbon are\u000d\u000a      removed from poly-disperse metallic particulates. FMS first\u000d\u000a      engaged with the MERI modelling group in 2008 via the coordinated\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Transfer activity Nanofactory (REF3a(b)). This enabled a\u000d\u000a      sustained intervention in which Halliday determined the key\u000d\u000a      decontamination mechanism in FMS's recycling process and developed\u000d\u000a      a LB-based model, based on reference [5], with which to simulate it. FMS\u000d\u000a      had no in-house expertise capable of undertaking such work. In 2010,\u000d\u000a      Halliday delivered a final report setting out simulations performed to\u000d\u000a      investigate the viscous shear stress effects underpinning the\u000d\u000a      decontamination stage of FMS's re-cycling process. The insight\u000d\u000a      this gave FMS into the capabilities of its industrial methodology\u000d\u000a      then aided in the development of its future business. Specifically, the\u000d\u000a      credibility provided by Halliday's report enabled the company to\u000d\u000a      substantiate its claims to customers. FMS went on to make two\u000d\u000a      successful TSB funding applications and in 2012 it was shortlisted for an\u000d\u000a      Advanced Manufacturing Award [A]. Beneficiaries from this impact are FMS\u000a          and its customers.\u000d\u000a    ZBD Displays is a Malvern-based technology company which was spun\u000d\u000a      out from QinetiQ in 2000 [B]. Its core business is based on a\u000d\u000a      specialist LCD technology - a very-low-energy display requiring no battery\u000d\u000a      power to retain its image - which it has successfully directed towards the\u000d\u000a      niche market of shelf-edge labelling for retail. As a small company with\u000d\u000a      limited funds or staff time for R&amp;D, ZBD Displays nevertheless\u000d\u000a      engaged the MERI modelling group on a 24 month (2005-7) DTI- funded\u000d\u000a      project [vii] to develop a detailed LB nemato-dynamics simulation scheme\u000d\u000a      and use it to investigate operational details of the ZBD device.\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, the company fully funded a further 6 months of research and\u000d\u000a      invested staff time to maintain the collaboration up to publication of a\u000d\u000a      joint paper in 2010 [3]. Given the company's size and the capabilities of\u000d\u000a      its staff-base, it would have been impossible for it to undertake such\u000d\u000a      work other than through partnership with the MERI group. The work\u000d\u000a      programme for this collaboration was designed to explore potential future\u000d\u000a      device improvements and, so, enable ZBD Displays to make informed\u000d\u000a      future strategic decisions. The simulations did, indeed, determine and\u000d\u000a      quantify potential improvements as well as providing insights into certain\u000d\u000a      failure mechanisms. However, the enhancements identified were ultimately\u000d\u000a      judged insufficient to warrant disruption of a working production process.\u000d\u000a      The key impact of MERI's interaction with ZBD Displays was,\u000d\u000a      therefore, that it provided the company with unambiguous \"capability\u000d\u000a      limits\" for its device hardware. This contributed to a fundamental shift\u000d\u000a      in the company's focus from its hardware origins to systems processes and\u000d\u000a      software [C]. ZBD Displays has thrived since its 2006-10\u000d\u000a      collaboration with MERI - in 2012 it achieved sales of &#163;12m, was ranked 5th\u000d\u000a      in the Sunday Times League Table of the UK's fastest growing technology\u000d\u000a      firms, and named top of the Deloitte Fast 50 technology firms following\u000d\u000a      5-year growth of 17910% [B]. Beneficiaries from this impact are ZBD\u000d\u000a          Displays, their share-holders and customers.\u000d\u000a    In 2007-08, the MERI modelling group worked with Kodak's then\u000d\u000a      European Research Lab in Cambridge to study an ink-droplet dispenser\u000d\u000a      module developed to enhance the capabilities of high- speed digital\u000d\u000a      printers [xii]. Kodak had a pre-existing patent on this module\u000d\u000a      [D], but had identified a requirement for specialist simulation work to\u000d\u000a      determine key operational processes and design parameters. Experimentally,\u000d\u000a      the geometry of this module had been shown to achieve consistent droplet\u000d\u000a      size uniformity, but ambiguities persisted regarding the underlying\u000d\u000a      physics. Therefore, in a study led by Care, LB simulations of multiple\u000d\u000a      droplet flow were performed using MERI's immiscible fluid algorithms [6]\u000d\u000a      in Kodak's module geometry. This succeeded in identifying the key\u000d\u000a      droplet pinch mechanism [E] and, thus, the module's main design\u000d\u000a      parameters. In particular it confirmed that there was a sound basis for\u000d\u000a      the observed droplet uniformity. Whilst Kodak underwent global\u000d\u000a      restructuring subsequent to this intervention, the relevant patent\u000d\u000a      remained active because (i) as part of Kodak's core printing\u000d\u000a      portfolio it was retained during chapter 11 proceedings and (ii) the\u000d\u000a      module's inventors (the Kodak employees who had worked with Care)\u000d\u000a      negotiated rights to exploit the device outside of printing through a new\u000d\u000a      spin-out Imbrys. Additionally, subsequent work on the module,\u000d\u000a      involving the same inventors, elicited a new patent filing on a different\u000d\u000a      feature of the droplet module [E]. Beneficiaries from the improved device\u000d\u000a      understanding achieved here are, then, Kodak and Imbrys,\u000d\u000a      through their ongoing patent interests in [D].\u000d\u000a    As well as working with a range of industrial groups, the MERI modelling\u000d\u000a      group also has a track record of achieving uptake of its simulation\u000d\u000a      algorithms by other modelling professionals. Direct uptake\u000d\u000a      includes that by modellers at Kodak (USA) and Petrobras\u000d\u000a      (Brazil) who have utilised the MERI group's LB algorithms to simulate\u000d\u000a      industrially-relevant systems. The former, which started through a direct\u000d\u000a      email query, has developed into an extended interaction [F]. More\u000d\u000a      systematically, the group has also contributed actively to the development\u000d\u000a      DL_MESO a commercially-available simulation package developed and\u000d\u000a      disseminated by the Computational Science Group at the STFC Daresbury\u000d\u000a      laboratory [G]. Specifically, Care and Halliday have been advisory panel\u000d\u000a      members for DL_MESO and the LB routines which comprise the bulk of\u000d\u000a      DL_MESO, including the multi-component schemes for both \"dipahsic\" and\u000d\u000a      many mutually immiscible fluids are, essentially, those developed in\u000d\u000a      references [5,6]. Downloads of the DL_MESO software in the REF impact\u000d\u000a      window total 637, of which 574 were from outside the UK [H]. Beneficiaries\u000d\u000a      from this work include relevant sections of STFC Daresbury\u000d\u000a      and their sponsors, due to the associated enhancements to their\u000d\u000a      product, as well as materials simulation professionals gaining\u000d\u000a      access to MERI-devised algorithms (either directly or through DL_MESO) and\u000d\u000a      applying them in a non- academic context.\u000d\u000a    The final impact achieved by the MERI modelling group relates to PUS\u000d\u000a      activities undertaken by Cleaver. In collaboration with partners from the\u000d\u000a      Universities of Manchester, Southampton and York and Sharp Labs Europe,\u000d\u000a      under the auspices of the British Liquid Crystal Society, Cleaver\u000d\u000a      developed and presented LC simulation material for the PUS stand \"Liquid\u000d\u000a      Crystals: Living Cells and Flat Screen TVs\" at the Royal Society\u000d\u000a      tri-centennial Summer Science Exhibition (July 2010) [J]. As well as\u000d\u000a      simulation-based display items and information sheets for teachers,\u000d\u000a      Cleaver developed a live interactive computer simulation application for\u000d\u000a      the event. The PUS stand was presented to Her Majesty the Queen, David\u000d\u000a      Willets MP, and many other dignitaries and Fellows of the Royal Society at\u000d\u000a      the Exhibition's opening event [J]. Over the following three weeks, the\u000d\u000a      event, which occupied the ground floor exhibition space of London's\u000d\u000a      Festival Hall, was attended by thousands of members of the public and\u000d\u000a      school groups, with over 2000 specifically visiting the LC stand. The\u000d\u000a      Royal Society gave a positive evaluation to Cleaver's stand and\u000d\u000a      subsequently nominated it for inclusion in the 30,000 footfall Big Bang\u000d\u000a      event (March 2011, Excel Arena, London). In this shorter, but larger,\u000d\u000a      event, a slightly revised version of the original stand was presented and\u000d\u000a      included in a Royal-Society-coordinated Family Tour called \"Specially\u000d\u000a      Selected\". Big Bang evaluated the LC stand as \"Excellent\" [K]. Follow\u000d\u000a      through on the events delivered in 2010 and '11 included write-ups in\u000d\u000a      'Liquid Crystals Today' and conference presentations. These were picked up\u000d\u000a      in the 'Routes to Impact' sections of several RCUK applications and\u000d\u000a      explicitly led to, for example, development of a PUS stand at Big Bang\u000d\u000a      Scotland 2013 from Strathclyde University. Additionally, resources\u000d\u000a      developed were shared with other PUS providers globally. For example,\u000d\u000a      Cleaver's live interactive computer simulation application was posted on\u000d\u000a      the high profile NSF-funded Soft Matter World website [L] where it has\u000d\u000a      achieved downloads from 5 continents of ~80 per month. Beneficiaries of\u000d\u000a      this impact were the Royal Society and Big Bang 2011; school\u000a        groups who visited the stand (as independently evaluated by the\u000d\u000a      Royal Society and Big Bang); and family groups who engaged in, for\u000d\u000a      example, the \"Specially Selected\" Royal Society Family Tour.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Fluid modelling approaches devised by the Materials and Engineering\u000d\u000a      Research Institute's (MERI's) materials and fluid flow modelling group\u000d\u000a      have impacted on industrial partners, research professionals\u000d\u000a      and outreach recipients. This case study focuses on economic\u000d\u000a        impacts arising from improved understanding which this modelling\u000d\u000a      work has given of commercial products and processes.

Particular areas of specialisation have been:\u000d\u000a      coarse-grained molecular simulation of ordered fluids; Lattice Boltzmann\u000d\u000a      (LB) simulation of multi-component fluids; and mesoscopic modelling of\u000d\u000a      liquid crystals (LCs). As set out below, much of this work has been\u000d\u000a      undertaken in collaboration with industrial partners.\u000d\u000a    The simulation methodologies developed by the MERI modelling group over\u000d\u000a      the last ~20 years represent an unrivalled suite of modelling tools for\u000d\u000a      LCD design and optimisation: no other group in the world can offer\u000d\u000a      molecular, coarse-grained, LB and mesh-free modelling of LCs. The group's\u000d\u000a      standing in this field originates from the period 1994-2002 when, in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the then Displays and Devices group at DERA\/QinetiQ\u000d\u000a      in Malvern, Care and Cleaver led a series of research projects relating to\u000d\u000a      molecular and mesoscopic computer simulation of LC behaviour. This\u000d\u000a      comprised four PhD projects partially supported by DERA\/QinetiQ\u000d\u000a      [i] and one by EPSRC [ii], and included innovations on the modelling of,\u000d\u000a      for instance, LC mixtures [1] and tilted smectic phases. Within this\u000d\u000a      collaboration, Cleaver and Care, working with senior scientists from DERA\/QinetiQ,\u000d\u000a      identified an industrial need for a methodology capable of modelling the\u000d\u000a      switching behaviour of LCDs. This triggered two projects (1998-2002) with\u000d\u000a      DERA\/QinetiQ within which a generalised LB simulation\u000d\u000a      approach for LCs was developed [2]. This also built on Halliday's previous\u000d\u000a      expertise on LB modelling of isotropic fluids (see below). The first of\u000d\u000a      these projects [iii] concentrated on a director-based LB model. The second\u000d\u000a      [iv], which focused on a prototype display device then being developed by\u000d\u000a      QinetiQ, prompted the development of algorithms for a more\u000d\u000a      comprehensive Qian- Shen Q-matrix description of LB nemato-dynamics [2].\u000d\u000a      This was particularly progressive since it aligned the simulations with\u000d\u000a      the continuum descriptions employed by QinetiQ's LCD designers.\u000d\u000a      Equipped with this designer-oriented technology, the MERI modelling group\u000d\u000a      secured EPSRC support [v] and a significant research contract with SEIKO-Epson\u000d\u000a      (2001-3) to develop, evaluate and document a mesoscopic LCD simulator\u000d\u000a      [vi]. However, SEIKO-Epson would not disclose its motivations or\u000d\u000a      intended usage of this simulator, so any impact arising from [vi] remains\u000d\u000a      uncaptured.\u000d\u000a    As documented in section 4, Care went on to lead a DTI-supported\u000d\u000a      [vii] project (2005-08) with ZBD Displays, an SME which had been\u000d\u000a      spun out from QinetiQ. This required the modelling group's LB\u000d\u000a      nemato-dynamics methods to be extended to incorporate realistic\u000d\u000a      representations of electromagnetism, dielectric inhomogeneity and complex\u000d\u000a      boundaries. The result was the first full device solver capable of\u000d\u000a      modelling the switching behaviour of a LCD [3]. Further innovations led by\u000d\u000a      Cleaver (2004-09) included simulations of LC anchoring at patterned\u000d\u000a      substrates [viii], which led to a joint publication with Sharp Labs\u000d\u000a        Europe, and the development of a fundamentally different \"mesh-free\"\u000d\u000a      approach for LCD modelling based on inherently multi-scale Modified Smooth\u000d\u000a      Particle Hydrodynamics methods. This approach was rolled out and tested in\u000d\u000a      an industrial context in 2009 through a collaboration with Hewlett-Packard\u000a        Labs, Bristol [4,ix].\u000d\u000a    In parallel with their developments on LC modelling, from 1997 the MERI\u000d\u000a      modelling group also established an expertise in LB simulation of\u000d\u000a      isotropic fluids, particularly immiscible multiphase- flows. Here, using\u000d\u000a      support from both industry [x-xii] and research councils [v,xiii] Care and\u000d\u000a      Halliday focussed on the development of mathematical descriptions and\u000d\u000a      simulation algorithms for fluid-fluid interfaces [5]. Achieving more\u000d\u000a      singular and isotropic representations of these interfaces enabled\u000d\u000a      descriptions of model systems whereby deformable particles suspended in an\u000d\u000a      ambient fluid were represented as multiple immiscible droplets. The\u000d\u000a      resultant algorithms subsequently found application in simulation of a\u000d\u000a      range of complex flows involving high-volume-fraction suspensions [6]. In\u000d\u000a      the context of engineering flows, this led to collaborative projects with:\u000d\u000a      BNFL on radioactive sludges; Rolls Royce Associates on\u000d\u000a      thermal fluids [x]; Fluent on algorithm refinement [xi]; Cadbury\u000d\u000a      on food systems; and Kodak on ink droplet formation [xii]. The\u000d\u000a      developments made with Fluent went on to form the basis of a collaboration\u000d\u000a      on haemodynamics with Harvard Medical School and another on biofluid flows\u000d\u000a      with UK experimental groups [xiii]. The modelling group's LB expertise was\u000d\u000a      also used in Knowledge Transfer interventions with Fluid Maintenance\u000d\u000a        Solutions and Nestl&#233;.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4960","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    MERI's HIPIMS research has achieved three streams of economic impact:\u000a      roll out of HIPIMS surface pre-treatment methods through coating system\u000a      manufacturers; direct collaboration with product manufacturers; and\u000a      discipline leading activities associated with the joint SHU-Fraunhofer\u000a      HIPIMS Research Centre.\u000a    Economic impact by roll out of HIPIMS surface pre-treatment methods\u000a          and other patents\u000a    In parallel with their academic research and publications, Ehiasarian and\u000a      Hovsepian have developed a portfolio of patents to protect the IP in their\u000a      HIPIMS innovations. Commercially, the most important of these has proved\u000a      to be EP1260603B1 [A] (filed 2001, granted 2006, validated in 12 EU\u000a      states), relating to the HIPIMS surface pre-treatment stage in the coating\u000a      production process [1]. This patent has been monetised by equipping\u000a      coating systems with special (licensed) modules that deliver the\u000a      pre-treatment described in [A]. MERI's HIPIMS pre-treatment technology has\u000a      been licensed non-exclusively in this way to four leading PVD coating\u000a      system manufacturers: Ionbond AG (Switzerland) [C]; SVS Vacuum\u000a        Coating Technologies GmBH &amp; Co (Germany); Hauzer Techno\u000a        Coating AG (The Netherlands) [D]; and CemeCon AG (Germany).\u000a      This has achieved two classes of beneficiary: the coating system\u000a      manufacturers, whose systems have been enhanced through incorporation of\u000a      the MERI module; and system purchasers, who have acquired the capability\u000a      of producing enhanced components. HIPIMS technology has become a key\u000a      activity of Hauzer Techno Coating (~200 employees) [D] and CemeCon\u000a      in the REF impact period.\u000a    Licence revenue paid to SHU (at a rate of &#8364;50k for entry to the programme\u000a      and &#8364;25k for each sale or retrofit of a coatings system) explicitly links\u000a      the system manufacturers and purchasers to the research described in section\u000a        2. In the REF impact period, six licensed systems have been\u000a      manufactured and two more retro-fitted. These have generated more than &#163;5m\u000a      of sales to the manufacturer beneficiaries and &#163;238,089 of\u000a        licence income to SHU. All licences (including those established\u000a      before the REF period) will run through to expiry of the patent [A] in\u000a      2021. As a result, the operators of ten coating systems have been beneficiaries\u000a      in the \"system purchasers\" sense over the REF impact period. Ehiasarian\u000a      and Hovsepian have no direct interaction with the \"system purchasers\", so\u000a      their specific uses of HIPIMS, and the associated sales figures, are in\u000a      commercial confidence. However, typical applications are known to include\u000a      wear and oxidation-resistant coatings for automotive engine components,\u000a      resulting in longer lifespans and higher operating temperatures, and\u000a      special coatings for dry high-speed machining tools, which yield enormous\u000a      improvements in cutting-tool lifetimes and machining speeds. Each of the\u000a      ten HIPIMS systems equipped with the MERI surface pre-treatment stage has\u000a      the capacity to produce &#163;10+m of components per year. Systems have been\u000a      operating on two shifts per day to produce a range of high-value\u000a      components [C,D].\u000a    In 2006 a further patent application was made to protect bias power\u000a      supply designs developed within an industrial collaboration. This was\u000a      granted in the UK (GB0607269B) and China (CN101461032B) [E] and remains in\u000a      application stage in Europe, Korea and Japan. It is co-owned by SHU, Hauzer\u000a        Techno Coating [D] and Huettinger Electronic Sp z.o.o. [F],\u000a      with Ehiasarian and Hovsepian the leading inventors. This technology was\u000a      commercialised in 2010, the two industrial co-owners retaining\u000a      manufacturing and sales rights. Within the REF impact period, it has\u000a      resulted in power supply unit sales exceeding &#163;1m (beneficiaries Hauzer,\u000a      Huettinger and their clients) and licence income to SHU of\u000a      &#163;15,181k.\u000a    Later patent filings by Ehiasarian and Hovsepian cover aspects such as\u000a      differing coating types and technical advances such as high rate\u000a      deposition, rare metal ion etching and inductively coupled etching. These\u000a      have not earned any income in the REF impact period, but have been\u000a      maintained within the overall IP portfolio due to their continued\u000a      commercial potential.\u000a    Economic impact by direct collaboration with product manufacturers\u000a    Within the second impact stream identified above, Ehiasarian has\u000a      delivered or started delivering collaborative and\/or licensed research to\u000a      a series of large manufacturers. In each case, the manufacturer is a\u000a        beneficiary through enhancements made to their products. These\u000a      include large licence contracts with Mahle (&#163;50k)\u000a      [vi] and Biomet (&#163;100k pa for three years) [ix] to develop\u000a      coatings for automotive piston rings and metal-on-metal hip implants,\u000a      respectively. Additional collaborations yielding economic impact\u000a        through product enhancement include:\u000a    \u000a      a &#163;100k project funded by OC Oerlikon Balzers (2006-10), to\u000a        develop HIPIMS coating deposition technology to allow writing of\u000a        miniaturised 3D-Integrated microelectronics devices. The company has\u000a        integrated this capability into its Clusterline 200 system, a\u000a        multi-stage coating machine, leading to sales exceeding &#8364;20m;\u000a      a 2008-11 collaboration with the Space Science Technology Department\u000a        of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) [vii], through which\u000a        coatings developed by the Ehiasarian group overcame a long-standing\u000a        issue with RAL's cryo-coolers for satellite applications. This work led\u000a        to the satellites being judged flight worthy and superior to competitor\u000a        technologies [G];\u000a      a 2011 collaboration with The Gillette Company (USA) which\u000a        resulted in a granted patent (US7966909B) [H] for a new HIPIMS-based\u000a        process for manufacturing razor blades with high aspect ratio cutting\u000a        edge and, therefore, improved shaving properties. The patent is the\u000a        property of Gillette with Ehiasarian and Hovsepian listed as named\u000a        inventors;\u000a      a 3-year (from 2013) research and development contract with Rolls\u000a          Royce to develop HIPIMS technologies appropriate to aero-engine\u000a        turbine blades [J].\u000a    \u000a    Economic impact through discipline leading activities\u000a    The symbiotic joint SHU-Fraunhofer HIPIMS Research Centre provides\u000a      technical and infrastructural benefits to both partners. The resultant\u000a      \"critical mass\" of HIPIMS expertise encompasses the capability needed both\u000a      to deliver large projects and also to support strategic industrial\u000a      development programmes in the UK, Germany and worldwide. This has resulted\u000a      in a large EPSRC-supported collaboration on high efficiency solar-cell\u000a      glass panels [viii] with Pilkingtons (UK), Gencoa (UK) and\u000a      Von Ardenne (Germany). The Joint Centre has also started to deliver\u000a      HIPIMS expertise to other companies such as Bosch and DOT GmbH,\u000a      Germany [B]. Since the prime function of the Fraunhofer IST is KT\u000a      and technology transfer, it can be viewed as a beneficiary under\u000a      REF impact, as can the collaborating industrial partners.\u000a    A further broadening of the MERI HIPIMS group's impact relates to the\u000a      discipline-leading activities through which it has expanded the field of\u000a      HIPIMS and, in particular, its industrial uptake. This expansion has\u000a      stimulated the development of a network of sub-system and component\u000a      providers who are a final group of beneficiaries. This includes\u000a      providers of analytical equipment, specialist power supplies and magnetron\u000a      systems and targets. This network is demonstrated by, for example the ~20\u000a      industrial exhibitors at the 2012 and 2013 annual International\u000a      Conferences on HIPIMS [K] run by MERI and the Fraunhofer IST.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Ehiasarian and Hovsepian of the Materials and Engineering Research\u000a      Institute (MERI) have achieved significant economic impact through\u000a      industrial uptake of their innovations in High Power Impulse Magnetron\u000a      Sputtering (HIPIMS). Exploiting these innovations, HIPIMS treatments have\u000a      been used by manufacturers to enhance the surface properties of millions\u000a      of pounds worth of products. Applications include industrial blades,\u000a      components within jet turbines, replacement hip joints, metallised\u000a      semiconductor wafers and satellite cryo-coolers.

Hovsepian was promoted to a personal Chair in\u000a      2004 and assumed the Head of Research Centre role when Munz retired.\u000a      Ehiasarian completed his PhD in the Surface Coatings Research Centre in\u000a      2002, was appointed to a permanent independent researcher role in MERI in\u000a      April 2004 (he was entered in RAE2008 as an Early Stage Researcher on that\u000a      basis) and promoted to a personal Chair in 2011. Both Ehiasarian and\u000a      Hovsepian were submitted by MERI in RAE2008 and both have been at SHU\u000a      throughout the REF period.\u000a    HIPIMS is a plasma vapour deposition (PVD) method for surface treatment\u000a      and coating. It uses a powerful plasma discharge to generate an ionised\u000a      vapour that is free of macro-particles. This vapour can be used either to\u000a      pre-treat surfaces of target components or to deposit a range of coatings\u000a      of specified composition and nanostructure. As detailed in section 4,\u000a      surface pre- treatments and nano-scale coatings based on Ehiasarian and\u000a      Hovsepian's HIPIMS advances have achieved a number of economic impacts,\u000a      most obviously by enhancing the properties and utility of a range of\u000a      end-products.\u000a    MERI's contributions to HIPIMS originate from Ehiasarian's thesis work\u000a      (supervised by Munz and other permanent staff, and partially supported by\u000a      [i]) which focused on the plasma physics diagnostics of what was, at the\u000a      time, a very new branch of PVD. A specific innovation that resulted from\u000a      this was a methodology for achieving \"fully-dense hard\" HIPIMS coatings\u000a      [1,A]. This methodology, based on use of short bursts of very intense\u000a      driving currents, proved capable of eliminating the intergranular pores\u000a      commonly found in PVD coatings. Subsequent research performed within MERI\u000a      between 2002 and 2012 addressed the fundamental issues of:\u000a    \u000a      HIPIMS coating microstructure, composition and adhesion [2.3,5];\u000a      plasma pre-treatment of substrates [3];\u000a      electrical gas discharge physics, plasma chemistry and distribution\u000a        [4,6];\u000a      and field-controlled plasma manipulation within the HIPIMS chamber\u000a        [4].\u000a    \u000a    This work demonstrated that previously unobtainable wear-resistance and\u000a      coverage properties could be realised using appropriate combinations of\u000a      electric and magnetic fields to manipulate the parent plasmas of different\u000a      source materials [4-6,ii-iv]. Further research studied process-microstructure-performance\u000a\u0009  relationships in HIPIMS-deposited thin films\u000a      [2.3,5], particularly microstructure evolution and self-organisation\u000a      phenomena.\u000a    In 2007 the group's HIPIMS machinery was up-graded to industrial\u000a      production grade with an automated system. Uniquely, within the University\u000a      sector, this provided an ability to develop the industrial applicability\u000a      of HIPIMS innovations. This up-scaling proved to be critical in realising\u000a      technology transfer to the manufacturing sector and, so, achieving\u000a      international impact. In particular, it enabled the development of\u000a      coatings for auto- and aero-engine components [v,vi], cryogenic materials\u000a      [vii], photovoltaic cell layers [viii], and biocompatible, antibacterial\u000a      coatings [ix].\u000a    In RAE2008, the strong research quality of the MERI Surface Coatings\u000a      Research Centre, under which this work was submitted, was specifically\u000a      highlighted in the final HEFCE feedback. The academic and industrial\u000a      reputation of HIPIMS research at MERI was further consolidated in 2010\u000a      with the establishment of the Joint Sheffield Hallam\u000a        University-Fraunhofer HIPIMS Research Centre, partnered with the\u000a      Fraunhofer Institute for Surface Engineering (Braunschweig, Germany) [B].\u000a      This was the first such centre in the UK. Ehiasarian is its Director.\u000a      Also, in 2010, EPSRC supported the establishment of a joint centre between\u000a      University of Leeds, University of Sheffield and MERI to establish a \"National\u000a        Innovation Playground to Widen the Operational Envelope for Tribological\u000a        PVD Coatings\" [iv]. Within this collaboration, Ehiasarian and\u000a      Hovsepian contributed HIPIMS solutions to tribological problems for UK\u000a      industry.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6342","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Much of our research in microwave\/millimetre-wave frequency components\u000d\u000a      post-1993, together\u000d\u000a      with its translation and impact post-2008, has been in partnership with Filtronic\u000d\u000a      or companies that\u000d\u000a      have arisen from Filtronic.

Much of our research in\u000d\u000a      this field over the\u000d\u000a      last 35 years has been in partnership with Filtronic Components Ltd,\u000d\u000a      which was founded by\u000d\u000a      Rhodes from the University in 1977 and floated as Filtronic PLC\u000d\u000a      in 1994, as well as with a number\u000d\u000a      of companies that have arisen directly from Filtronic.\u000d\u000a    Here, we focus on two areas of Leeds research, and their impact\u000d\u000a      post-2008: the development of\u000d\u000a      dielectric filters (Hunter, Rhodes, Pollard); and, the accurate\u000d\u000a      physical modelling of semiconductor\u000d\u000a      devices, leading to the design of high breakdown voltage power transistors\u000d\u000a      (Snowden).\u000d\u000a    In 1998, Leeds started a new research activity, led by Hunter, on\u000d\u000a      the development of dielectric\u000d\u000a      resonator filters for the rapidly expanding mobile communications market.\u000d\u000a      This work, in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Filtronic Comtek Ltd, led to a new method of\u000d\u000a      realizing cross-couplings using non-resonant\u000d\u000a      nodes, the latter being needed to produce zeros in the filter transfer\u000d\u000a      function. A new\u000d\u000a      class of patented dual-mode filters resulted, where each\u000d\u000a      dielectric resonator supports two\u000d\u000a      orthogonal resonant modes [1]; hence an eight pole filter requires only\u000d\u000a      four dielectric resonators,\u000d\u000a      leading to a significant and commercially important 50% reduction in size\u000d\u000a      and mass (Hunter and\u000d\u000a      Rhodes, `Dual TM Mode Composite Resonator' US Patent 6,414,571 B1,\u000d\u000a      priority 15\/10\/1997).\u000d\u000a    As cellular networks became deployed more widely, there was a need for\u000d\u000a      interference rejection\u000d\u000a      filters with bandwidths of &lt;1 MHz at centre frequencies of 1 GHz for\u000d\u000a      base stations. Leeds\u000d\u000a      therefore conducted research into the synthesis of filters with\u000d\u000a      significant dissipation loss and non-uniform\u000d\u000a        Q filters were patented (Rhodes and Hunter, `Reflection mode filter\u000d\u000a      and method with a\u000d\u000a      constant loss offset' US Patent 6,448,872 B2, priority 28\/02\/2001). This\u000d\u000a      new technique took low-Q\u000d\u000a      structures into account, avoiding any reduction in skirt selectivity and\u000d\u000a      was then extended to\u000d\u000a      transmission-mode filters with elimination of the requirement for a\u000d\u000a      circulator [2].\u000d\u000a    Based on this research, Leeds received funding from two TSB projects with\u000d\u000a      TWI (Cambridge) to\u000d\u000a      develop filter designs (`Adept-Sip' Ref. 461348, &#163;398,401,\u000d\u000a      1\/05\/2006-31\/10\/2009; and `PPM2' Ref.\u000d\u000a      475416, &#163;325,000, 1\/06\/08-31\/11\/11), as well as consultancies with the\u000d\u000a      Defence Technology\u000d\u000a      Centre for Electromagnetic Remote Sensing to underpin applications in the\u000d\u000a      defence sector.\u000d\u000a    More recently, with the development of LTE and 4G systems by cellular\u000d\u000a      radio operators, there has\u000d\u000a      been the need to develop directional channel combining filters. To respond\u000d\u000a      to this, and working\u000d\u000a      with Radio Design Ltd, Leeds developed a theoretical synthesis\u000d\u000a      technique for the design of\u000d\u000a      directional filters for 4G power combining systems (`Apparatus for\u000d\u000a      allowing radio frequency\u000d\u000a      selectivity and method of use thereof', Patent Application No.\u000d\u000a      GB1222019.0, priority 7\/12\/12).\u000d\u000a      These filters enable very high selectivity to be achieved in a small\u000d\u000a      physical size [3].\u000d\u000a    The quality of this underpinning research is exemplified by: Hunter's\u000d\u000a      FIEEE in 2007; election by the\u000d\u000a      Board of Directors to General Chair of the 2011 European Microwave week;\u000d\u000a      award of an RAEng\u000d\u000a      Research Chair in 2012 (co-funded by Radio Design Ltd) on the\u000d\u000a      `Theory and design of filters for\u000d\u000a      mobile communication systems'; and, FREng in 2013.\u000d\u000a    In addition to developing filter technology for cellular base station\u000d\u000a      application, from the early 1990s\u000d\u000a      Leeds research also tackled the increasing need for more efficient, and\u000d\u000a      linear, microwave power\u000d\u000a      amplifiers for handsets and base stations.

Further impact has been generated\u000a      through the use of this\u000a      instrumentation in, for example, the metrology and standards industry.\u000a    The PNA-X platform, which is the microwave industry's highest performing\u000a      network analyzer in\u000a      terms of its noise performance and accuracy, together with portable RF\u000a      analyzers incorporating the\u000a      same technology (the FieldFox platform), are sold to the wireless,\u000a      aerospace and defence\u000a      industries and were all directly brought about by research at Leeds [A].\u000a      The results from the\u000a      research on noise measurement [1] were incorporated into the PNA-X\u000a      platform as an option from\u000a      2008. Customers include (but are not limited to) in aerospace and defence:\u000a      Northrop Grumman,\u000a      Astrium, Selex, Raytheon, multiple defence agencies; in\u000a      telecommunications: NSN, Ericsson,\u000a      Motorola; in computing: Cisco, Huawei, Intel; and, in microwave\u000a      electronics: Mini-circuits, Miteq,\u000a      and Filtronic (itself an earlier spin-out from the School). This work\u000a      contributed to Agilent becoming\u000a      a global leader in network analyzers, with a greater market share than all\u000a      other companies\u000a      combined. Owing to commercial sensitivity, Agilent is unable to provide\u000a      precise figures for sales of\u000a      its products, however, a senior Agilent executive confirms: \"The\u000a        revenue from the noise figure\u000a        option to the PNA-X is in the tens of millions of dollars annually\"\u000a      [A].\u000a    The algorithms described in reference [2] were incorporated into the\u000a      Agilent dielectric probe\u000a      measurement kit (model number 85070E) in 2009 [A]. The University of Leeds\u000a      related work with\u000a      Agilent on the extraction of material parameters from substrate integrated\u000a      waveguide cavity\u000a      resonators [3] led directly to the Agilent Technologies scanning probe\u000a      microscope range, with\u000a      models 5400 and 5600LS first brought to market in 2009. Specifically, this\u000a      work led to a new\u000a      modality being incorporated into this instrumentation (SMM mode), which\u000a      enables complex\u000a      impedance (resistance and reactance), calibrated capacitance, and\u000a      topography measurements\u000a      within the same instrument [A]. This microscopy modality outperforms\u000a      traditional AFM-based\u000a      scanning capacitance microscopy techniques, since it does not require any\u000a      contact between the\u000a      probe head and the sample. The instrument is now being sold routinely to\u000a      the semiconductor\u000a      industry for calibrated dopant density measurements on silicon wafers, as\u000a      well as to research\u000a      organisations worldwide [A]. Again, precise sales figures of the\u000a      dielectric probe kit and scanning\u000a      probe microscope range are not available for commercial reasons, but a\u000a      senior Agilent executive\u000a      states: \"I can confirm that the key academic work on which these\u000a        developments were based was\u000a        published in two papers by Pollard and co-workers (References [2] and\u000a        [3]) ... The specific revenue\u000a        from these solutions is in the tens of millions of dollars annually\"\u000a      [A]. Furthermore, \"collective sales\u000a        of all these products (network analyzers, open-ended dielectric probes,\u000a        and scanning probe\u000a        microscope) have been in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars\u000a        per year\" [A].\u000a    To give one example of the broader impact that University of Leeds\u000a      research has achieved through\u000a      the organizations that have bought Agilent Technologies instrumentation,\u000a      there has been\u000a      substantial impact in the metrology sector, with the network analyzers\u000a      being used by, for example,\u000a      the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) for accurate calibration of high\u000a      frequency instrumentation\u000a      [B]. Agilent's network analyzers, incorporating technologies developed at\u000a      Leeds as discussed\u000a      above, are now considered to be the industry standard for these\u000a      measurements - \"we have\u000a        specifically chosen Agilent Technologies Network Analysers for the high\u000a        precision that they offer,\u000a        for their ability to offer state-of-the-art error correction routines,\u000a        and, for their ability to provide\u000a        implementations of the very latest measurement and calibration\u000a        techniques\" [B]. NPL has also\u000a      confirmed that the availability of this Agilent Technologies\u000a      instrumentation has enabled them to\u000a      offer a wide range of measurement capabilities to its customers \"that\u000a        have led to an income over\u000a        the period 2008-2013 of approximately &#163;50M\" [B]. The fan-out\/impact\u000a      from the customer\u000a      calibration services also provides a major source of income for many\u000a      third-party laboratories\u000a      involved as links in the measurement assurance\/traceability chain &#8212; for\u000a      example, one calibration\u000a      from NPL can validate tests made on many thousands of devices on many\u000a      industrial shop floors\u000a      and production lines [B].\u000a    This case study exemplifies how the School of Electronic and Electrical\u000a      Engineering at Leeds\u000a      adopts a long-term and sustainable approach towards ensuring the impact of\u000a      its research. Agilent\u000a      Technologies (and formerly Hewlett Packard) have sponsored 15 PhD students\u000a      in the School over\u000a      this on-going period of collaboration. Furthermore, the School has also\u000a      trained a number of\u000a      researchers who have taken up employment with Agilent, providing further\u000a      impact from the\u000a      research.

Pollard subsequently assumed an on-going R&amp;D\u000a      consultancy role in the\u000a      company, visiting each summer, until 2010 when he retired from the\u000a      University and took up a\u000a      permanent, part-time, position with Agilent.\u000a    Pollard's research focussed on the study of solid-state devices and\u000a      circuits operating at microwave\u000a      frequencies, and in particular the development of techniques to measure\u000a      the high frequency\u000a      properties (from a few megahertz up to the terahertz frequency range) of\u000a      electronic devices and\u000a      materials. His research exploited vector network analyzers, which are used\u000a      to measure these high\u000a      frequency electronic properties &#8212; a high frequency signal is applied to a\u000a      device or material and the\u000a      output signal analyzed. Key characteristics, termed S-parameters, are\u000a      measured, which show\u000a      what proportion of the input radiation is absorbed and what is reflected\u000a      by the material or device-\u000a      under-test, and how this changes as a function of frequency.\u000a    A key focus of Leeds research since 1993 has been the development of new\u000a      algorithms to quantify\u000a      and extract background noise from S-parameter measurements. This research,\u000a      led by Pollard,\u000a      resulted in a theory for error correction and noise figure analysis in\u000a      1994. An algorithm was\u000a      developed using load pull measurements to establish very accurate\u000a      impedance and noise states,\u000a      working with Agilent to develop the mathematics to derive a noise figure\u000a      from these noise state\u000a      measurements [1]. These algorithms now underpin the operation of all\u000a      Agilent network analyzers,\u000a      including the PNA-X platform launched in 2008.\u000a    In 1997, Leeds researchers under Pollard reported a new way to measure\u000a      the high frequency\u000a      properties of materials without the need for the test material to have\u000a      integral electrical contacts.\u000a      Instead, an open-ended coaxial cable is placed on the surface of the test\u000a      sample [2]. Supported in\u000a      part by EPSRC award GR\/K00783 (&#163;114,320, 1994-1996), Pollard developed the\u000a      algorithms that\u000a      allow accurate extraction of the microwave frequency properties of\u000a      materials by this method\u000a      without needing to form any fixed waveguide on the material surface. The\u000a      results of this research\u000a      form the basis of Agilent's 8507E dielectric probe kit launched in 2009,\u000a      and the body of work to\u000a      date led, in part, to a major JIF\/EPSRC award in 2001 (GR\/M87535,\u000a      &#163;2,188,383, 2001-2003),\u000a      which developed a 300 GHz microwave and millimeter-wave instrumentation\u000a      facility at Leeds.\u000a    In 2008, Pollard's group (now including Hunter who joined the\u000a      University from Filtronic in 1998)\u000a      developed the world's first substrate integrated waveguide sensor for\u000a      measuring microwave\u000a      properties of small volumes of liquid solvents [3]. This work (carried out\u000a      in part while Pollard's PhD\u000a      student, Saeed, was on a five month GRASS-ROOT internship at Agilent in\u000a      2008) formed the basis\u000a      for the development of Agilent's scanning capacitance probe microscope.\u000a      This is a modified\u000a      atomic force microscope, which not only produces topographical and\u000a      morphological images of a\u000a      surface &#8212; as is standard &#8212; but also provides information on the high\u000a      frequency dielectric properties\u000a      of the surface under examination, allowing doping maps of semiconductors\u000a      to be produced, for\u000a      example. The latter application has seen widespread sales of this\u000a      equipment across the\u000a      semiconductor sector, inter alia.\u000a    For his scientific and engineering contributions internationally, Pollard\u000a      was elected as an IEEE\u000a      Fellow in 1997.

In particular, this research\u000d\u000a      focussed on the combination of data from multiple sensors to establish\u000d\u000a      spatial distributions in a range of applications, initially stimulated by\u000d\u000a      industrial interest in monitoring mate-rial flow in inaccessible\u000d\u000a      processes, e.g. oilfield flows.\u000d\u000a    This research gained industrial and research council support, e.g.\u000d\u000a      through the dti-LINK-IMS project Industrial 3-component flow\u000d\u000a        measurement using novel tomographic techniques' (GR\/H55741) with\u000d\u000a      UMIST (1993-1996), and EPSRC funding `Intelligent measurement of\u000d\u000a        velocity profiles in turbulent gas flows using ultrasonic tomographic\u000d\u000a        imaging' (GR\/J49686, 1995). This led to the development of\u000d\u000a      tomographic systems based on ultrasonic sensors in 1996 [1].\u000d\u000a    Major industrial applications were then targeted through investment from\u000d\u000a      a Foresight Challenge project: `Process tomography &#8212; a new dimension in\u000d\u000a        advanced sensor technology' (GR\/L22591) with thirteen partners,\u000d\u000a      including AstraZeneca, Schlumberger, Unilever, and\u000d\u000a      Du Pont (1997-2000), and Hoyle's co-ordination of an EU Thematic\u000d\u000a      Network (BRRT-CT97-5039) on `Advanced Tomo-graphic Sensors for\u000d\u000a        Industrial Multiphase Imaging' with 30 partners (1997-2000). This\u000d\u000a      led to the optimization of real-time performance using multiple active\u000d\u000a      sensors in ultrasonic process tomogra-phy [2], and the subsequent\u000d\u000a      optimization for two-phase flow imaging [3].\u000d\u000a    Based on this research, Hoyle assembled, and led, a multi-disciplinary\u000d\u000a      university consortium &#8212; the Leeds Ultrasound Research Interest Group\u000d\u000a      (LURIG) &#8212; to explore new application concepts (1996-2002). This group\u000d\u000a      included, from Biology, Dr Dean Waters who specialized in bat\u000d\u000a      echolocation, and Dr Deborah Withington, who specialized in\u000d\u000a      neuroscience, including the perception of sound. Drawing inspiration from\u000d\u000a      their combined backgrounds, it became apparent that there was an opportunity\u000d\u000a\u0009  to develop a new medical device based on Hoyle's work on\u000d\u000a      ultrasonic sensors and data fusion techniques [1-3] &#8212; a multi-sensor\u000d\u000a      ultrasonic aid to provide range and safety data for people who are\u000d\u000a      visually impaired (VI). (We use the accepted phrase `visually impaired'\u000d\u000a      throughout this case study to refer to people who have a significant\u000d\u000a      limitation of their visual capability, including those who are completely\u000d\u000a      blind). This innovation became known as UltraCane. UltraCane\u000d\u000a      (Fig. 1) works through use of two high-quality-factor, ultrasonic sensors,\u000d\u000a      integrated within a cane &#8212; these give range data to the nearest obstacle,\u000d\u000a      and provide feedback through two tactile vibrators of haz-ards in the\u000d\u000a      forward (e.g. people and buildings) and elevated (e.g. overhanging\u000d\u000a      branches) paths.\u000d\u000a    Through the University's Research and Innovation Services, LURIG filed a\u000d\u000a      patent in 1997 on the UltraCane concept, which was later extended\u000d\u000a      to give worldwide coverage [4]. Arising from this, a University spin-out\u000d\u000a      company, Sound Foresight Ltd, was formed in 1998, and the patent\u000d\u000a      (which is still maintained) was transferred to the company.

Most of these were very\u000d\u000astable brominated compounds which are easy to use, provided they are compatible with the host\u000d\u000apolymer, and at loadings of around 10 % they will meet the flammability requirements.\u000d\u000aUnfortunately they leach out of products and have subsequently been found to be persistent,\u000d\u000abioaccumulative and toxic (PBT). The fire retardant community has been searching for\u000d\u000areplacements, while parts of the \"green\" lobby have been calling for a global ban on all fire\u000d\u000aretardants. In general, halogen-free fire retardants based on phosphorus, nitrogen or mineral fillers\u000d\u000aare much more polymer specific, and therefore require greater time and investment to optimise\u000d\u000aproduct formulations. Once a formulation has been optimised, approved and certified, any further\u000d\u000achanges must overcome large barriers. HP estimate that replacement of a single substance in a\u000d\u000aproduct formulation costs $5-10 M (H. Wendschlag; FRPM, Lille 2013). In the case of HMH, merely\u000d\u000aknowing it had fire retardancy potential was not enough to persuade customers to investigate it\u000d\u000afurther; the claims and counterclaims in the literature needed to be addressed and the mechanism\u000d\u000aunderstood, to explain why the good results were not artefacts. An independent academic study\u000d\u000afrom UCLan's leading fire research group provided the credible evidence base to support results\u000d\u000aproduced in-house at LKAB. This was necessary to encourage innovation, including costly\u000d\u000achanges in formulation. To hasten the progress, drafts of the papers were provided to the\u000d\u000acompany sales team, prior to formal publication. In addition, two important points needed to be\u000d\u000amade in respect of the perceived problems of fire retardants. The first, that many of fire retardants\u000d\u000ahad no connection with the PBT problems of halogenated fire retardants, and the second that there\u000d\u000awere significant differences within the halogen-free group of fire retardants. Like aluminium metal,\u000d\u000aATH requires very large amounts of energy during manufacture, and produces an equal mass of\u000d\u000ahighly alkaline toxic red sludge (which flooded an area of Hungary in 2010, resulting in 10 deaths),\u000d\u000awhereas HMH production involves low energy processes of mining, sieving and grinding. As a\u000d\u000aplenary speaker at the Brominated Flame Retardants Symposium in Kyoto (BFR 2010, an\u000d\u000aacademic conference of environmental scientists concerned about the widespread distribution and\u000d\u000aharmful effects of brominated flame retardants), Hull shared the platform with professors from\u000d\u000aAmsterdam Free University,Berkeley, Boston, Kyoto and Stockholm where he was able to highlight\u000d\u000athese important distinctions. Soon afterwards, Wikipedia's pages on \"flame retardants\" and \"fire\u000d\u000aretardants\" described HMH as a key example of an environment friendly fire retardant. Direct links\u000d\u000ato CloK, UCLan's online repository have resulted in thousands of downloads of these key research\u000d\u000apapers (see section 3). The final obstacle was the need for LKAB to increase production - there is\u000d\u000ano point in persuading customers to undertake the costly process of formulation development\u000d\u000ausing a product which is in short supply. Armed with the mechanistic understanding, technology\u000d\u000awas selected to optimise particle size distribution, platyness and mixture ratios. This involved LKAB\u000d\u000ainvesting several million dollars in new plant in Turkey and the UK, tripling capacity to 60,000\u000d\u000atonnes per year. This confidence in the continued shift from ATH (the market for the fine grade of\u000d\u000aATH alone is $250 M per annum) is the most concrete indicator of the significant impact of this\u000d\u000aresearch. The greater fire safety and environmental benefits are much harder to quantify.\u000d\u000aBeneficiaries and nature of impact\u000d\u000aLKAB Minerals are the primary beneficiaries of this research, through significant increase in sales\u000d\u000avolume. However LKAB's product is their customers' raw material, offering superior FR\u000d\u000aperformance and better environmental ratings. Therefore, where the use of HMH results in a\u000d\u000amarket lead for product, this is of far greater value than the cost of the raw materials. For example\u000d\u000ain the halogen-free cable industry (a rapidly growing area of the European market) [TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] [cable\u000d\u000acompounder] have gone into production with a superior ethylene-copolymer HMH formulation.\u000d\u000aUnlike the alternatives, the platy huntite slows down the burning rate, through formation of a\u000d\u000aresilient residue, allowing the cable to meet Euroclass B2. The use of a naturally occurring raw\u000d\u000amaterial, requiring minimal processing has obvious environmental advantages, both in energy\u000d\u000ausage and clean manufacture (especially when compared with the toxic red mud generated as part\u000d\u000aof ATH production).

In 2007, the fire group moved to UCLan,\u000d\u000aand continued to build on this important work, supported by the &#8364;2 M PredfireNano project. In\u000d\u000a2008, this led to Minelco (now LKAB Minerals) seconding one of their staff (Hollingbery) to\u000d\u000aundertake a PhD at UCLan to investigate the fire retardant behaviour of hydromagnesite and\u000d\u000ahuntite (HMH) mixtures.\u000d\u000aOur detailed research explained why the established understanding of the fire retardant\u000d\u000amechanism of mineral fillers was incorrect, and showed that naturally occurring mixtures of\u000d\u000ahydromagnesite and huntite (HMH) were more effective than the market leader, ATH.\u000d\u000aHitherto, HMH had been reported as an unsuitable alternative to ATH, based on a flawed\u000d\u000aunderstanding of HMH's fire retardant mechanism*&#8224;. Two critical reviews of the literature\u000d\u000ahighlighted, first, the conflicting accounts of the mechanisms of thermal decomposition of HMH\u000d\u000amixtures [1], and second, the major misconceptions regarding their fire retardant behaviour [2].\u000d\u000aWhile these reviews clarified a number of issues, they identified clear gaps in our understanding of\u000d\u000athe thermal decomposition and fire retardant behaviour of HMH.\u000d\u000aIn parallel to this work, a UCLan funded PhD student (Witkowski) modelled the fundamental\u000d\u000amechanisms of thermal decomposition and fire retardant behaviour, using an energy-balance\u000d\u000amodel of fire retardant effects caused by the decomposition of various mineral fillers. This allowed\u000d\u000athe four fire retardancy contributions (heat capacity of the filler; decomposition endotherm; heat\u000d\u000acapacity of the volatiles; and heat capacity of the residue) to be quantified. Moreover, their effects\u000d\u000ain standard flammability assessments such as the limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL 94 and cone\u000d\u000acalorimeter were estimated. The purpose of the model was to separate the known and quantifiable\u000d\u000aeffects of mineral filler fire retardants from other, less-known factors. The failure of the model to\u000d\u000apredict the superior fire retardant performance of HMH demonstrated the importance of these other\u000d\u000afactors.\u000d\u000aThis led to two detailed experimental studies. The first investigated the interaction between the\u000d\u000adecomposition of the combination of the two minerals and the influence of the decomposition\u000d\u000aproduct carbon dioxide, which could not escape when fillers were compounded into a polymer [3].\u000d\u000aThe second focused on the fire retardant behaviour [4]. This paper conclusively showed:\u000d\u000a(i) that the platy nature of the huntite component of the mixture was responsible for stabilisation\u000d\u000aof the protective residue around the bulk of the polymer;\u000d\u000a(ii) the inadequacy of the LOI test to predict burning behaviour;\u000d\u000a(iii) the superiority of HMH mixtures over the market leader, ATH.\u000d\u000aA further investigation reconciled the differences between the simple model and the actual fire\u000d\u000aretardant behaviour [5], showing how the cone calorimeter failed to respond to the large\u000d\u000adecomposition endotherm, the conversion of acetic acid to acetone on the surface of the filler, and\u000d\u000athe subsequent delay in heat release rate.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"9035","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In July 2006, Magnomatics Ltd was spun-out from the University of\u000a      Sheffield in order to\u000a      commercialise the high performance electric drives employing magnetic\u000a      gearing arising from the\u000a      research at Sheffield.

However,\u000a      although high system torque densities can then be achieved, gearboxes\u000a      usually require lubrication\u000a      and cooling, whilst noise, vibration and reliability can be significant\u000a      issues. Magnetic gears can\u000a      offer several advantages, such as, reduced acoustic noise and vibration,\u000a      reduced maintenance\u000a      and improved reliability, inherent overload protection and physical\u000a      isolation between input and\u000a      output shafts. Despite these advantages magnetic gear topologies have\u000a      exhibited very low torque\u000a      transmission densities which severely restricted the scope of their\u000a      applications.\u000a    In 2001, Professor Kais Atallah (University of Sheffield, since 1994)\u000a      proposed a magnetic gear\u000a      topology, with a theoretical torque transmission density in excess of\u000a      100kNm\/m3, which is at least\u000a      an order of magnitude higher than the torque density of magnetic gear\u000a      topologies proposed\u000a      previously [R1]. Following an EPSRC funded 12-month feasibility study\u000a      (GR\/R46519\/01), in 2002,\u000a      together with Dr Stuart Calverley (Research Associate), he realised a\u000a      demonstrator magnetic gear\u000a      which confirmed the theory [R2]. During a follow-up EPSRC funded project\u000a      (GR\/S70685\/01), which\u000a      started in August 2004, Atallah proposed a novel method of integrating a\u000a      magnetic gear with a\u000a      brushless permanent magnet machine to realise a very torque dense `pseudo'\u000a      direct-drive machine\u000a      [R3], a novel harmonic magnetic gear, and a linear version of the magnetic\u000a      gear [R4]. Together\u000a      with Dr Jan Rens (Research Associate), he produced the first demonstrator\u000a      `pseudo' direct-drive-\u000a      drive machine. For both EPSRC funded projects Atallah was the PI and the\u000a      research was rated as\u000a      internationally leading.\u000a    Although various ways of integrating a permanent machine with a magnetic\u000a      gear exist, the\u000a      proposed technique enables a permanent magnet machine and a magnetic gear\u000a      to be\u000a      mechanically as well as magnetically integrated, hence, optimising\u000a      the utilisation of the permanent\u000a      magnet material and simplifying the mechanical construction. The proposed\u000a      and demonstrated\u000a      `pseudo' direct-drive electrical machine exhibited a torque density higher\u000a      than that of the state-of-\u000a      the-art transverse permanent magnet machine, with the added benefit of a\u000a      much improved power\u000a      factor, i.e. more than 0.9 for the `pseudo' direct-drive electrical\u000a      machine compared to a reported\u000a      maximum of ~0.5 for the transverse flux machine. Inherently, the low power\u000a      factor of transverse\u000a      flux machines, which were proposed in 1980s, has been the main obstacle in\u000a      the way of their\u000a      adoption for many applications where torque density is a very important\u000a      characteristic, such as\u000a      ship propulsion.\u000a    Although the `pseudo' direct drive has been the main technology being\u000a      commercialised by\u000a      Magnomatics Ltd, it is certainly not the only one. Atallah has also\u000a      researched and produced a\u000a      novel power-split device based on the magnetic gearing topology described\u000a      above, and which can\u000a      be operated as a magnetic Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) [R6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9036","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Joint research by Kingsley and O'Keefe into dielectric resonator antennas\u000a      has had significant commercial impact through the spin out company\u000a      Antenova.

Sheffield University owned 18% of Antenova.\u000a    From the basic research Kingsley, as Chief Scientist and\u000a      co-inventor, further developed small dielectric antennas which eventually\u000a      led to the current range of RADIONOVA products in 2008 that can be seen on\u000a      the Antenova website (www.antenova.com)\u000a      [S1] and the more recent chip antennas (2010) produced in considerable\u000a      numbers that appear in mobile phones and tablets.\u000a    The PhD student (Dr Liu) became an Antenova employee on completing his\u000a      studies in 2011 taking the research into the company for commercial\u000a      development. Dr Liu has designed two standard antennas, that are selling\u000a      in high volumes, as well as several custom antennas which arose from\u000a      research at Sheffield. For example a project in production with LG for\u000a      their 7 - 10 inch portable multi-media devices uses the low frequency band\u000a      technology for FM\/TV bands reported in [R6].

Antenova was set up to work at the high end of the market\u000a      using advanced antenna technology to make products for high- end feature\u000a      phones and smart phones. The requirements on the antenna are much more\u000a      severe in these products. The antennas are correspondingly more expensive,\u000a      but attract a much higher margin, typically 60%.\u000a    The IP and Engineering assets of Antenova were bought out by Microsoft\u000a        Corporation, USA in 2013 to gain commercial advantage for their\u000a      future products.\u000a    Company Performance\u000a    Antenova was a UK-registered, UK-based company with its headquarters in\u000a      Cambridge.

The underpinning\u000a      research which led to this spin out company was an equal and joint effort\u000a      by Dr Simon Kingsley (Reader, Sheffield University, 1980-2001) and Dr\u000a      Steven O'Keefe (Senior Lecturer, Griffith University) into dielectric\u000a      resonator antennas from 1998-2002. Such antennas had originally been based\u000a      on low permittivity dielectrics but research by Kingsley and O'Keefe\u000a      extended this to much higher permittivity materials allowing much smaller\u000a      antennas to be made. This in turn led them to develop small low profile\u000a      antennas. In [R1] they changed the radiated beam direction of a dielectric\u000a      resonator antenna (DRA) by exciting different probes within the\u000a      dielectric. In some combinations, a pair of probes had a much greater\u000a      bandwidth than a single probe which overcomes a significant and\u000a      fundamental limitation. They also examined cylindrical and rectangular\u000a      dielectric resonator shapes [R2] to study the fundamental antenna\u000a      properties that were achieved when the DRAs were bisected through an image\u000a      plane by a conducting sheet. The resultant half DRAs were smaller in\u000a      volume and had a more directional radiation pattern than conventional DRA\u000a      geometries. A number of patents were filed (some key patents [R3-R5]) were\u000a      the direct outcome of the research [R1] and [R2].\u000a    The fundamental output of the underpinning research has resulted in very\u000a      small, high dielectric constant antennas that are able to function at many\u000a      different frequency bands and are highly resistant to detuning. The\u000a      current range of Antenova chip antennas would not have been developed\u000a      without the early work at Sheffield showing that practical antennas can be\u000a      made from high dielectric materials. The advanced antenna technology\u000a      developed from the academic partners has resulted in smart phones and\u000a      other mobile devices being able to perform a very wide range of functions\u000a      in a small miniaturized unit. This research on high dielectric constant\u000a      antennas was instrumental in making practical mobile phone antennas from\u000a      the invention.\u000a    Kingsley and O'Keefe had an equal intellectual input to Antenova\u000a      researching the High Dielectric Antenna technology [R1, R2] that resulted\u000a      in the significant patents [R3-R5]. Kingsley made further contributions to\u000a      the impact taking place by extending the research into Antenova.\u000a    Kingsley recognised the potential impact of this research and left\u000a      Sheffield in June 2001 to set up and work at Antenova as Chief Scientist.\u000a      Sheffield continued to collaborate with Antenova in the following period\u000a      with advice on setting up and calibrating anechoic chambers, and also in\u000a      training some of the Antenova staff.\u000a    Simon Kingsley became a Visiting Professor at Sheffield in 2007 and\u000a      Antenova funded a PhD studentship (Luyi Liu) at Sheffield developing\u000a      reconfigurable antenna technologies [R6]. These new technologies have led\u000a      to significant new antenna products for Antenova from 2012.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9152","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Ilika Technologies Ltd focuses on three key markets, namely energy\u000d\u000a      storage and capacity, materials for improving electronic component\u000d\u000a      performance, and new materials that have interesting catalytic, electronic\u000d\u000a      and magnetic properties.

The body of work on ferroelectric thin films that Reaney has\u000d\u000a      published is recognised worldwide as having established the basic\u000d\u000a      blueprint of how to control the microstructure and properties of PZT thin\u000d\u000a      films deposited by sol-gel spin coating. Reaney was the first to establish\u000d\u000a      directly the relationship between the use of excess PbO and the resulting\u000d\u000a      microstructure\/properties. He established the basic mechanism by which\u000d\u000a      film orientation can be controlled and also determined how in thicker\u000d\u000a      films (1 micron), porosity can result from the formation of metallic Pb\u000d\u000a      particles during pyrolysis [R1, R2].\u000d\u000a    Reaney's background in ferroelectric thin film technology, his knowledge\u000d\u000a      of structure and microstructure obtained from extensive studies using\u000d\u000a      advanced transmission electron microscopy and his world renowned\u000d\u000a      appreciation of solid state chemistry mean that he is one of a small\u000d\u000a      handful of scientists capable of interacting with the SME Ilika Technology\u000d\u000a      on the deposition of oxide films.\u000d\u000a    In 1999, Professor Ian Reaney (Department of Materials Science and\u000d\u000a      Engineering, University of Sheffield, since 1994) was awarded an EPSRC\u000d\u000a      grant, `Multilayer sol-gel processing of thick PZT films for sensor and\u000d\u000a      actuator applications' (GR\/M33501\/01) in which he developed an\u000d\u000a      understanding of the crystallisation of sol-gel thin films. The work\u000d\u000a      resulted in two papers published in international Journals [R1, R2].\u000d\u000a      Reaney has continued to study PZT thin films and has been awarded two\u000d\u000a      further grants `The effect of constraint and thickness on octahedral tilt\u000d\u000a      transitions in perovskite structured thin films' (EP\/D067049\/1) and\u000d\u000a      `Domain wall-defect interactions in ferroelectric (EP\/I038934\/1) which\u000d\u000a      have resulted in a number of publications in high impact factor journals.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, the Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) at Ilika Technologies and\u000d\u000a      Reaney undertook a collaborative EPSRC funded proof of concept study\u000d\u000a      (EP\/F015259\/1) to determine if compositions in the PbO-Nb2O5\u000d\u000a      phase diagram exhibit large dielectric tunability and low dielectric loss\u000d\u000a      for potential applications as tuneable electronic filters. New highly\u000d\u000a      promising tuneable dielectrics in the cubic pyrochlore phase field were\u000d\u000a      discovered, which is now leading to optimisation and prototype device\u000d\u000a      fabrication [R3, R4].\u000d\u000a    In 2004, Reaney was invited to participate in a Knowledge Transfer\u000d\u000a      Partnership (KTP) with Ilika. The first KTP (No 862) entitled, `To develop\u000d\u000a      novel PbO-free piezo-electric ceramic compositions for industrial\u000d\u000a      applications using Plasma Vapour Deposition (PVD) Technology', spearheaded\u000d\u000a      the development of methodologies to deposit oxide based films. Prior to\u000d\u000a      this project, Ilika had expertise in metals and polymer thin films for\u000d\u000a      catalysis but no background in functional oxides for piezoelectric,\u000d\u000a      dielectric or ferroelectric applications. The deposition methodologies\u000d\u000a      developed are described in detail in refs [R5, R6] but, in brief, a proof\u000d\u000a      of concept stage was first attempted, based on the high throughput\u000d\u000a      synthesis of lead zirconate titanate (PZT). After the initial\u000d\u000a      experimentation, the most productive method of operation was determined to\u000d\u000a      be at room temperature where deposition rates are maximised in an O2\u000d\u000a      rich environment within the PVD vacuum chamber. This resulted in the\u000d\u000a      formation of an amorphous oxide phase, which was then crystallised in a\u000d\u000a      furnace to form the PZT perovskite structure, a process based on the\u000d\u000a      sol-gel deposition method researched and optimised by Reaney.\u000d\u000a      Compositional spreads of varying Zr:Ti ratio were obtained and structural\u000d\u000a      phase boundaries determined by a combination of energy dispersive X-ray\u000d\u000a      analysis, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Reaney's experience\u000d\u000a      and understanding of amorphous to perovskite transformations in sol-gel\u000d\u000a      thin film deposition was pivotal in establishing control over the\u000d\u000a      microstructure and thus obtaining the desired functional properties. His\u000d\u000a      appreciation of the role of excess PbO and the relationship between\u000d\u000a      composition and grain structure were critical in understanding\u000d\u000a      microstructure\/structure\/property relations leading to film optimisation.\u000d\u000a      In 2009, Ilika and Reaney undertook a second KTP (No 7023), entitled: `To\u000d\u000a      develop PbO free, high remnant polarisation ferroelectric films suitable\u000d\u000a      for the fabrication of non-volatile memories', which extended the\u000d\u000a      collaboration for a further 3 years and extended the portfolio of complex\u000d\u000a      oxides that Ilika were capable of fabricating.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9153","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research led to the development of an evidence-based, commercially\u000d\u000a      available, cell therapy.

The latter company formed a subsidiary Altrika Ltd to focus on\u000d\u000a      MySkin&#174; and a related product Cryoskin.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on patients and practitioners:\u000d\u000a    The commercial availability of MySkin&#174; from 2004 to the\u000d\u000a      present time has benefited patients, clinicians (burns surgeons,\u000d\u000a      diabetologists) and dressing nurses using this product to treat patients.\u000d\u000a      Thanks to Prof MacNeil's proactive approach to disseminating her results\u000d\u000a      at meetings of burns and wound healing professionals in the UK from 2004\u000d\u000a      to the present day, the clinical community has been made aware of the\u000d\u000a      sound evidence base and the potential benefits of the technology, leading\u000d\u000a      to the gradual adoption of the therapy by practitioners in these areas and\u000d\u000a      use of the products on patients (MySkin&#174; has been used to treat\u000d\u000a      over 300 cases since 2008, with each patient requiring up to 50 treatments\u000d\u000a      by MySkin&#174;). The major health impact of this research has been\u000d\u000a      the improved outcomes of UK patients with extensive burns &#8212; increasing\u000d\u000a      their chances of survival. The technology has offered burns surgeons in\u000d\u000a      the UK the potentially life-saving option of a cell expansion and delivery\u000d\u000a      service for treating those patients who are in extremis and in\u000d\u000a      danger of death because of the extent of their burns injuries. This is the\u000d\u000a      only commercial service that burns surgeons can access for\u000d\u000a      treatment of patients if conventional therapies fail, and (as noted by the\u000d\u000a      head of the Sheffield Burns Unit, below) patients with major burns\u000d\u000a      represent a real clinical challenge. For these patients, getting swift\u000d\u000a      barrier function is essential and difficult. The use of cultured cell\u000d\u000a      therapy leads to improved health outcomes through greatly reduced risk of\u000d\u000a      infection and death and shortened stays in hospital [S2]. The Operations\u000d\u000a      Director of Altrika Ltd says \"Use of the cultured cell technology in\u000d\u000a        burns units has been increasing since 2008 due to the growing evidence\u000d\u000a        base that early intervention of these therapeutic approaches can be cost\u000d\u000a        effective, coupled with efficiencies in cost of manufacture that make\u000d\u000a        the approach more sustainable for a wider patient cohort. Altrika\u000d\u000a        recently added the burns units in Birmingham and Manchester to its list\u000d\u000a        of customers, bringing the total number of burns centres in England \/\u000d\u000a        the UK who have used this cell therapy to 11 out of 12, with 6 of these\u000d\u000a        being regular repeat users\" [S1].\u000d\u000a    The Head of the Burns Unit Sheffield Hospitals says in referring to\u000d\u000a      MySkin&#174; &#8212; \"The transition of MySkin&#174; from\u000a        research to the clinic, provided through the company CellTran, provided\u000d\u000a        a commercial service that I or other burns surgeons could access for the\u000d\u000a        treatment of our patients. At its establishment, it was the first such\u000d\u000a        commercially available skin service in the UK and to the best of my\u000d\u000a        knowledge it's still the only commercially available skin cell service.\u000d\u000a        Thus the company established a valuable clinical resource, which we use\u000d\u000a        for those extensively burned patients who can't be easily managed with\u000d\u000a        conventional skin grafting alone. It is only appropriate to use cultured\u000d\u000a        cell therapy for patients with major burns, these patients represent a\u000d\u000a        real clinical challenge and it is good to know that in the UK there is a\u000d\u000a        useful resource based on expanding the patient's cells in the laboratory\u000d\u000a        which clinicians can access\" [S2].\u000d\u000a    The other health impact has been on patients with chronic non-healing\u000d\u000a      ulcers, which have failed to heal despite best clinical practice. Patients\u000d\u000a      with access to cultured cell therapy have benefited from the availability\u000d\u000a      of the service &#8212; cell therapy can stimulate wounds to heal and restore\u000d\u000a      quality of life. For these patients [S4] MySkin&#174; greatly\u000d\u000a      improves their quality of life and reduces hospital (or home) treatment\u000d\u000a      costs.\u000d\u000a    Economic impact:\u000d\u000a    The cell therapy was developed through a University of Sheffield spin-out\u000d\u000a      company, Celltran Ltd, which was formed in 2000 for the sole purpose of\u000d\u000a      developing and commercialising the underpinning research, including\u000d\u000a      providing a strong clinical evidence base for the culture and delivery of\u000d\u000a      patients' skin cells for clinical benefit. The first product was launched\u000d\u000a      as MySkin&#174; in 2004. The product is produced in a GMP facility\u000d\u000a      in Sheffield and has been selling consistently since its launch,\u000d\u000a      commercialised through a number of different companies:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Celltran was formed in 2000 and commercialised the technology from\u000d\u000a        launch in 2004 through to late 2008. The company created 16 jobs and\u000d\u000a        raised &#163;4 million in investment income from 2004 until 2008. This\u000d\u000a        supported a team of 16 surface engineers, cell biologists and clinical\u000d\u000a        staff (burns surgeons, wound care nurses and staff involved in the study\u000d\u000a        of diabetic ulcers) and staff who set up and ran clean rooms and engaged\u000d\u000a        in all aspects of the commercialisation of this technology.\u000d\u000a      In October 2008 the IP and GMP facility were purchased by York Pharma\u000d\u000a        for &#163;70k plus royalties for 5 years; the greater of &#163;100k (20k per year)\u000d\u000a        or 10% of revenues generated.\u000d\u000a      In September 2009, Ilika bought the GMP facility, setting up a wholly\u000d\u000a        owned subsidiary Altrika, solely to commercialise this technology (http:\/\/www.ilika.com\/history.aspx).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In December 2012, Altrika was bought by Adiposet Ltd, a medical logistics\u000d\u000a      and service company and continues to commercialise both MySkin&#174;\u000d\u000a      and CryoSkin.

However, for people\u000d\u000a      that have over 60% burns, conventional treatments simply do not work. Cell\u000d\u000a      therapy can be invaluable for patients with extensive full thickness burns\u000d\u000a      (otherwise vulnerable to bacterial infection, sepsis and death) and many\u000d\u000a      thousands of patients with chronic ulcers that do not heal with current\u000d\u000a      best clinical practice.\u000d\u000a    The research undertaken by Professor Sheila MacNeil's team (University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield since 1976) developed a methodology with a sufficient\u000d\u000a      performance and success rate to make it commercially viable and therefore\u000d\u000a      clinically useful as a service to health practitioners.\u000d\u000a    The research arose from her longstanding collaboration with the Sheffield\u000d\u000a      Burns Unit. This began in 1992 using the (then) best practice methodology\u000d\u000a      of culturing human skin cells into small sheets for delivery to patients\u000d\u000a      with extensive burns injuries. They undertook a 10-year clinical audit of\u000d\u000a      this technique and concluded that it delivered poor performance in meeting\u000d\u000a      clinical need. In particular these very delicate sheets of cells were\u000d\u000a      difficult to handle and the success rate with them was poor. Also, it was\u000d\u000a      very challenging to manage the timing of their production to the needs of\u000d\u000a      the patients. All of the above explains why this cell therapy approach was\u000d\u000a      not previously adopted for routine use in Burns Centres or Wound Care\u000d\u000a      Centres in the UK.\u000d\u000a    Accordingly, from 1997 onwards MacNeil developed an improved, simpler and\u000d\u000a      more robust methodology for delivering patient's skin cells from the\u000d\u000a      laboratory to the patient [R1-6] through collaboration with Professor\u000d\u000a      Robert Short (a surface science engineer in the Department of Materials\u000d\u000a      Science &amp; Engineering from 1995-2007). The product MySkin&#174;\u000d\u000a      was developed through a spinout company, Celltran Ltd, which ran from 2000\u000d\u000a      to 2008.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning technology was plasma polymerisation, which was used to\u000d\u000a      make a surface that was attractive for the attachment of skin cells\u000d\u000a      (keratinocytes) but not too adhesive so that cells placed in contact with\u000d\u000a      the patient would readily leave the cell delivery carrier surface and\u000d\u000a      transfer to the wound bed.\u000d\u000a    MacNeil's distinctive research contribution was that she led the team\u000d\u000a      that started with a clinical problem &#8212; the need to provide a rapid barrier\u000d\u000a      for patients who have lost extensive skin due to burns injuries. An\u000d\u000a      analysis of the current technology was undertaken to provide cultured cell\u000d\u000a      therapy to restore this barrier and a materials surface engineering\u000d\u000a      solution was designed. The treatment method was refined through\u000d\u000a      collaborations that involved the local hospitals with introduction to the\u000d\u000a      clinic, and then developing MySkin&#174; as the commercially\u000d\u000a      sustainable product.

In 2003 the Massachusetts Institute of\u000d\u000a      Technology `Think Tank' report for the US government on The Future of\u000d\u000a        Nuclear Power [S6] recommended that DBD be considered for the\u000d\u000a      disposal of US spent fuel.\u000d\u000a    In the USA, a mined repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was originally\u000d\u000a      scheduled to take its first spent nuclear fuel in 1998. However, technical\u000d\u000a      and political problems led to increasing delays. Consequently, the DOE was\u000d\u000a      forced to pay substantial sums to power-generating utilities to continue\u000d\u000a      storing spent fuel at their nuclear power plants, awaiting disposal. In\u000d\u000a      2010, the Obama administration cancelled the Yucca Mountain programme\u000d\u000a      (despite expenditure of &gt;$10 billion), and established the Presidential\u000d\u000a      Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) on America's Nuclear Future, to conduct a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive review of waste management policy and recommend a new\u000d\u000a      strategy. Influenced by our publications, Sandia National Laboratory (SNL)\u000d\u000a      approached Sheffield in 2010 to form a consortium partnership with MIT,\u000d\u000a      producing joint publications and workshops [S7], leading to favourable\u000d\u000a      media coverage [S8]. A major impact was that DBD became incorporated into\u000d\u000a      the Blue Ribbon Commission's thinking. The Blue Ribbon Commission's 2012\u000d\u000a      report to the Secretary for Energy [S2] contained a central recommendation\u000d\u000a      (p.27) that \"The United States should undertake an integrated nuclear\u000d\u000a        waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or\u000d\u000a        more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent\u000d\u000a        fuel and high- level nuclear waste.\" Further, it stated specifically\u000d\u000a      (p.95) that \"the Commission has identified deep boreholes as a\u000d\u000a        potentially promising technology for geologic disposal that could\u000d\u000a        increase the flexibility of the overall waste management system and\u000d\u000a        therefore merited further research, development and demonstration\".\u000d\u000a      The report featured (p.31) a key diagram from one of the Sheffield\u000d\u000a      publications [R2] and cited others (p.137) in support of its deliberations\u000d\u000a      and conclusions. The Director of Sandia National Laboratory, says\u000d\u000a      Sheffield work \"led to several members of the BRC taking a personal\u000d\u000a        interest and to the substantial discussion of DBD disposal concepts in\u000d\u000a        the draft and final BRC report, including the citation of some of your\u000d\u000a        own work\" [S1].\u000d\u000a    In 2012, the US DOE commissioned and funded the Sandia NL &#8212; Sheffield &#8212;\u000d\u000a      MIT consortium to prepare a \"roadmap\" for the research, development and\u000d\u000a      practical demonstration of the concept, with Sheffield contracted to\u000d\u000a      develop the plan and research programme. Among the unique aspects of this\u000d\u000a      roadmap arising from the Sheffield research is the use of high-density\u000d\u000a      support matrices and the sealing of the boreholes by \"rock welding\". All\u000d\u000a      of this is clear evidence of the influence of the University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield's pioneering research [S1] on US energy policy and the future\u000d\u000a      development of the deep borehole concept within it.\u000d\u000a    Impact in the UK. In 2007 Committee on Radioactive Waste\u000d\u000a      Management (CoRWM) was reconstituted to advise the Government on\u000d\u000a      development of policy and Prof. F. Gibb was appointed to CoRWM by the\u000d\u000a      Minister. The Government accepted CoRWM's recommendations for geological\u000d\u000a      disposal policy and in 2008 published its Managing\u000a          Radioactive Waste Safely White Paper [S9] setting out a framework for the implementation of\u000d\u000a      geological disposal in a mined repository with deep borehole disposal\u000d\u000a      regarded as an `alternative'. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has\u000d\u000a      published plans for a geological disposal facility to take the first\u000d\u000a      legacy high-level wastes and spent fuel by 2075. However, it has recently\u000d\u000a      come under significant Government pressure to accelerate implementation\u000d\u000a      and has reported [S3] on possible options in which it includes the deep\u000d\u000a      borehole disposal of high level waste in its scenario to maximise\u000d\u000a      acceleration.\u000d\u000a    The Sheffield work is clearly the source of much of the NDA's knowledge\u000d\u000a      of the concept and has influenced these developments. Two members of the\u000d\u000a      Sheffield research team have been closely involved with the NDA (Prof. F.\u000d\u000a      Gibb through CoRWM, consulting and presenting at NDA- sponsored\u000d\u000a      conferences and Prof. N. Chapman as chair of NDA's Technical Advisory\u000d\u000a      Panel).\u000d\u000a    Impact in Sweden. In 2012 the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and\u000d\u000a      Waste Management Company (SKB) applied to the regulator and Environmental\u000d\u000a      Court to begin construction of a mined repository for the disposal of\u000d\u000a      spent fuel at the Forsmark site. The choice of a mined repository is being\u000d\u000a      challenged on the grounds that it is potentially not as safe, secure or\u000d\u000a      environmentally friendly as the DBD concept and is therefore not the \"best\u000d\u000a      available technology\". The case against regulatory approval is underpinned\u000d\u000a      by evidence from the Sheffield publications and a report by Prof. F. Gibb\u000d\u000a      on SKB's case against the use of deep boreholes [S10]. The Court has\u000d\u000a      subsequently requested SKB reconsider the DBD concept.\u000d\u000a    The use of deep bore holes as opposed to mined repository will have a\u000d\u000a      future economic impact. To illustrate the potential cost savings in a UK\u000d\u000a      context, the boreholes required to dispose of the country's legacy\u000d\u000a      inventory of vitrified high-level waste in the NDA's \"scenario 3\" [S3]\u000d\u000a      would cost around &#163;220M compared with the NDA's current plans for disposal\u000d\u000a      in a &#163;4.3 billion mined repository.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    An innovative deep borehole disposal (DBD) concept for radioactive waste,\u000d\u000a      pioneered at the University of Sheffield, resulted in significant impact\u000d\u000a      on geological disposal strategy with an international reach. In the USA,\u000d\u000a      our work contributed to a change in geological disposal strategy, with our\u000d\u000a      concept described by the Director of Sandia National Laboratory as a\u000d\u000a      \"legitimate and a viable alternative [to the mined, engineered repository\u000d\u000a      model] worthy of deeper consideration\" [S1]. The Presidential Blue\u000d\u000a        Ribbon Commission report on America's Nuclear Future\u000d\u000a      recommended that DBD be taken forward to a practical pilot demonstration,\u000d\u000a      now funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) [S2]. Sheffield's work on\u000d\u000a      DBD influenced Sweden's regulators and Environmental Court to reconsider\u000d\u000a      approval of a mined repository by SKB.

This concept is referred to as Deep Borehole Disposal (DBD).\u000d\u000a    The novelty and distinctiveness of Sheffield research involved the\u000d\u000a      recognition that mined repositories (at geologically shallow depths) are\u000d\u000a      unlikely to provide the necessary long-term isolation from the biosphere\u000d\u000a      required for emplaced radioactive wastes to decay to a safe condition (ca.\u000d\u000a      106 years). Sheffield's research suggested that a new approach,\u000d\u000a      which placed greater emphasis on the geological barrier, would be a more\u000d\u000a      secure and environmentally preferable alternative. Our concept uses large\u000d\u000a      diameter boreholes to bury radioactive waste between 3 and 5 km deep in\u000d\u000a      the Earth's crust, beyond the reach of near-surface groundwater, using\u000d\u000a      geology to isolate the contamination risk until decay had rendered the\u000d\u000a      waste radiologically harmless.\u000d\u000a    Ground breaking research carried out by the Sheffield group resulted in\u000d\u000a      international recognition and acceptance of the feasibility of the DBD\u000d\u000a      concept as described in Section 3.

In 1993,\u000d\u000a        BNFL funded research at Sheffield to further develop the concept, led by\u000d\u000a        Prof. F.

An important outcome was the introduction of an innovative\u000d\u000a        approach to sealing the boreholes by a process of melting and\u000d\u000a        recrystallizing the host rock, referred to as \"rock welding\" [R5-R6], as\u000d\u000a        presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science\u000d\u000a        annual meeting in 1999.\u000d\u000a      In 2003 a seminal paper was published [R2], drawing the attention of\u000d\u000a        the international nuclear community to the potential of the DBD concept.\u000d\u000a        Dr Travis joined the group and the research was expanded to include\u000d\u000a        numerical modelling, especially of heat flow related to the disposal of\u000d\u000a        heat-generating wastes such as spent fuel. This work, funded by EPSRC\u000d\u000a        (GR\/T08975\/01), expanded the DBD concept to disposal of a much wider\u000d\u000a        range of spent fuels and high-level wastes, e.g. [R2, R5, R6]. The\u000d\u000a        research led to the award of two patents: for the introduction of novel\u000d\u000a        high-density support matrices for spent fuel disposal (WO2008125803\u000d\u000a        (A1)), and for the introduction of a deep borehole scheme for the\u000d\u000a        disposal of waste plutonium (WO2008032018 (A2)). The work on plutonium\u000d\u000a        disposal was presented at the 2007 Materials Research Society meeting,\u000d\u000a        receiving considerable media coverage.\u000d\u000a      Since 2007, research has focused on the disposal of the high burn-up\u000d\u000a        spent fuels likely to be generated in new Generation III reactors,\u000d\u000a        including mixed oxide (MOX) fuels (in keeping with the UK Government's\u000d\u000a        policy for the recycling of plutonium). Our most advanced modelling\u000d\u000a        codes have shown that the higher heat outputs of such spent fuels pose\u000d\u000a        no problems in the DBD concept, in contrast to mined repositories where\u000d\u000a        they necessitate additional measures, delays and costs [R6].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    From 1993-2012, 5 academic staff [led by Prof. F.

The strong and ultra-light parts help\u000a      to save weight (30% compared to glass-fibre-reinforced PP has been\u000a      achieved) and lower exhaust emission levels and increase fuel economy.\u000a      Because these materials are 100% recyclable, the material is ideal for use\u000a      in automotive parts where the EU's End of Life Vehicle (ELV) Directive\u000a      dictates recycling rates up to 95% by the year 2015.\u000a    Luggage: TUMI\u000a        Tegra-Lite's premium luggage collection was introduced in 2012 and\u000a      is produced from Tegris&#174; composite material from Milliken &amp;\u000a      Company. Self-reinforced PP is ideal for hard shell luggage applications\u000a      where impact resistance, stiffness and weight are primary concerns. Tegra-\u000a      Lite combines an industrial aesthetic look, with a design that is 65%\u000a      lighter than glass fibre composites and provides up to 15x improvement in\u000a      impact resistance over typical thermoplastics, while it maintains this\u000a      performance level at low temperatures (-40&#176;C), far exceeding other\u000a      comparable pieces of commercial hard-sided cases on the market today. PURE&#174;\u000a      is also used for impact resistant flight cases, attach&#233; and iPad cases.\u000a      TUMI is the world's second largest producer of hard shell luggage and\u000a      their Tegra-Lite series is available from large department stores like\u000a      Macy's or Selfridges as well as online retailers like Amazon.\u000a    Motor racing: The motor racing world has adopted SR-PP in a\u000a      number of ways. Powerstream's\u000a        Aero splitters based on Tegris&#174; were introduced in 2011\u000a      and are now being used in NASCAR racing, as well as for door panels to\u000a      replace carbon fibre. Self-reinforced PP is not as light or as stiff as\u000a      carbon fibre composites; but it has about 70% of its strength at about 10%\u000a      of the cost. One of the most important reasons for its use in motor racing\u000a      besides its lightness, superior impact resistance and low cost, is the\u000a      fact that it does not splinter when it breaks, which prevents having sharp\u000a      pieces of splitter lying on the track after a crash, improving driver\u000a      safety. The material is also incorporated in the new DeltaWing racer,\u000a      developed by Chip Ganassi Racing for the American IndyCar series.\u000a    Protective armour: Tegris&#174; is used in life\u000a      saving protective armour by the U.S. military in its vehicles, primarily\u000a      against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or roadside bombs. Milliken\u000a      qualified Tegris&#174; for a number of military armour applications\u000a      and in 2010 they have shipped 20,000 Tegris&#174; armour kits for\u000a      vehicles deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Predominantly flat panel\u000a      systems for spall liners, these kits are used to retrofit vehicles for\u000a      enhanced protection. Norwegian company ROFI Industries AS have developed\u000a      their Armadillo\u000a        De-mining Mask against humanitarian mine action (HMA). The mask,\u000a      which is made from PURE&#174; is lighter, stronger and more\u000a      comfortable than existing de-mining masks and has proven to be effective\u000a      in demining operations. The mask won the Index Award 2007, an\u000a      international design award to promote design that improves life. Another\u000a      outfit that appreciates the lightness and toughness of the material is\u000a      Riddell, makers of body armour for American football players. Its Custom\u000a        Power&#174; Lightspeed Shoulder PadsTM was\u000a      introduced in 2010 and are claimed to be the lightest in the business\u000a      without compromising protection. PURE&#174; is also used for helmets\u000a      and other sports gear.\u000a    Blast Basket: Parcel bombs, either real or suspect are a\u000a      potential problem for security agencies, major corporations and targeted\u000a      groups. The PURE&#174; Bomb or Blast Basket, is placed over the\u000a      suspected object and protects property and personnel from the blast and\u000a      fragmentation occurring when an IED is set off. It captures most of the\u000a      metal fragments and redirects the blast waves upwards, protecting\u000a      civilians. For example, a 35 kg blast basket, 400 mm high with a 500 mm\u000a      diameter, can handle a 1 kg TNT bare explosive charge.\u000a    Kayaks: The UltimateTM\u000a        12 Kayak from Legacy Paddlesports in the U.S., was introduced in\u000a      2007 and was one of the first commercial uses of PURE&#174; or\u000a      Tegris&#174; in a large 3D part, creating the strongest, lightest\u000a      kayak on the market. SR-PP is used because of it high stiffness and high\u000a      impact resistance, so it can shrug off hard landings and damage from rocky\u000a      bottoms. Other applications are in skis, snowboards, and surfboards.\u000a    \u000a      Self-reinforced polypropylene composites based on\u000a          co-extruded tape technology (PURE and Tegris) are\u000a          being used for a wide range of applications incl. (from top left to\u000a          bottom right) automotive undershields,\u000a          luggage, motor racing parts, protective sports gear, bomb baskets,\u000a          de-mining mask and kayaks.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out by Prof. Ton Peijs and colleagues has led to\u000a      significant breakthroughs in engineering plastics: PURE&#174;\u000a      and its licensed Tegris&#174;\u000a      technology, which are lightweight self- reinforced alternatives to\u000a      traditional polypropylene (PP) composites such as glass-fibre or natural-\u000a      fibre-reinforced PP.

The `PURE'\u000a      research project was initiated by Peijs in the fall of 1998 and was\u000a      supported by the Dutch Government through their Economy, Ecology and\u000a      Technology (EET) programme. This collaborative project, led by Peijs ran\u000a      until 2004 and included 4 industrial partners including Lankhorst Indutech\u000a      (Sneek, The Netherlands). The QMUL research team led by Peijs and funded\u000a      through this EET programme drove the project from the start and involved\u000a      two PhD students (Norbert Cabrera and Ben Alcock), together with several\u000a      project students focusing on the process development and characterization\u000a      of high strength tapes and SR- PP (or all-PP) composites. The research\u000a      team was complimented by another PhD student and researcher at Eindhoven,\u000a      where Peijs maintained a part-time position to lead this team. From\u000a      2002-2004 the QMUL research team was complimented by two postdoc funded\u000a      through an EU FP5 project ORTHOFLEX (G5ST-CT-2002-50185) and a DTI project\u000a      ENVIROCOMP, focusing on developing thermoforming technologies for these\u000a      SR-PP materials. A patent was filed in 2001 on the concept of\u000a      self-reinforced polypropylene composites by Lankhorst Indutech with Peijs\u000a      as co- inventor (WO\/2003\/008190; Polyolefin Film, Tape or Yarn) and the\u000a      first results were published from 2003 onwards [1-6].\u000a    Polypropylene already has many advantages as it has the lowest\u000a      environmental impact of all petroleum-based polymers, but on its own it is\u000a      not strong enough for many engineering applications such as in automotive\u000a      parts. Normally PP has to be reinforced with glass- or natural fibres to\u000a      make it strong and stiff. However, the addition of these reinforcements\u000a      makes recycling more complicated, time-consuming and expensive, ruling out\u000a      the advantages of this useful plastic. Because of legislation such as the\u000a      End of Life Vehicle (ELV) directive, materials selection is now strongly\u000a      driven by recyclability and for this reason mono-materials are preferred.\u000a      However, if automotive panels are to be made from non-reinforced bulk PP\u000a      they simply have to be made thicker, or strengthened with extra ribbings,\u000a      which would make these parts heavier, defeating the industry's quest to\u000a      find lightweight alternatives to metals, as in transport applications the\u000a      environmental impact of materials is largely dominated by potential weight\u000a      savings through improved fuel efficiency and emission reductions.\u000a    PURE&#174; `all-PP' composites are unique in that both the\u000a      reinforcement and matrix are made of the same material. They have specific\u000a      ecological advantages over traditional composites based on glass- or\u000a      natural fibres since they are entirely thermoplastic and can be re-melted\u000a      at the end of the product's life cycle without the need for a fibre\u000a      recovery process. Self-reinforced PP takes normal PP and by heating and\u000a      stretching treatments it aligns the molecules to make the end product 10\u000a      times stronger and stiffer, without any weight gain [1,6]. The technology\u000a      is based on highly engineered co-extruded tape which consists of a high\u000a      strength and high modulus PP core and a specially formulated thin PP\u000a      copolymer skin for welding the tapes together using heat and pressure\u000a      [1,2]. This process of co-extrusion and tape welding gives enormous\u000a      processing advantages over other `SR-PP' alternatives such as Curv&#174;\u000a      as these co-extruded tapes exhibit a much larger processing window\u000a      (20-30&#176;C to 1-2&#176;C for Curv&#174;). The tapes can be woven into\u000a      fabric and can be hot-pressed together into sheet. Parts can be produced\u000a      by thermoforming [5] or can be moulded directly from fabric using filament\u000a      winding, compression, autoclave or vacuumbag moulding, or can be combined\u000a      with PP foam or honeycomb into fully recyclable lightweight sandwich\u000a      panels [4].\u000a    In recent years, Peijs' research into all-polymer composites has moved\u000a      towards other polymer systems such as HDPE, PET, PLA, cellulose and aramid\u000a      [6]. Many of these programmes were in collaboration with industrial\u000a      partners such as DSM Dyneema, Novameer, Dow Chemical, Teijin Monofilament,\u000a      Shell and GE Plastics. Peijs' team assisted in the development of\u000a      high-strength high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tapes and self-reinforced\u000a      HDPE composites (KAYPLATM)\u000a      This work on SR-HDPE, in collaboration with Novameer BV (The Netherlands)\u000a      was initially aimed at developing a cost-effective alternative for the\u000a      anti-ballistic market, but is currently also used in panels for caravans\u000a      and vans. After a buy-out by Japanese fibre giant Teijin for ~&#163;10m in\u000a      2010, Novameer became part of Teijin Monofilament (became Nextrusion\u000a      GmbH). KAYPLATM tape is currently being produced by Compomeer\u000a      in Greece, with UD and cross-ply sheet production in The Netherlands. High\u000a      strength polyester (PET) tapes were developed for higher temperature\u000a      resistance products in collaboration with Dow, GE Plastics (became Sabic\u000a      Innovative Plastics) and later also Teijin Monofilament (became Nextrusion\u000a      GmbH). Fully biobased all-polymer composites are currently being developed\u000a      based on polylactic acid (PLA) in the framework of the EU FP7 Matera+\u000a      programme `HIGHBIOPOL'. Since 2003 our research in this area has been\u000a      published in over 30 papers in international peer reviewed journals\u000a      together with a large number of invited international conference and\u000a      key-note papers. One of the PhD students (Norbert Cabrera) received the\u000a      2005 Dow Energy Dissertation Award for his research in the area of\u000a      sustainable use of energy and sparing the environment. The award included\u000a      a prize of &#8364;2500 for his winning thesis entitled `Recyclable\u000a      all-polypropylene composites'. After his graduation, Dr. Cabrera was hired\u000a      by Pure Composites to lead their R&amp;D in the area of composite\u000a      processing. As recognition for his work on self-reinforced plastics Peijs\u000a      received the Dutch Polymer Award of Polymer Technology Netherlands (PTN)\u000a      in 2008 and the Swinburne Medal &amp; Prize of the Institute of Materials,\u000a      Minerals and Mining (IOM3) in 2010.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18316","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The work carried out in Queen Mary's Rubber Research Group has informed\u000d\u000a      the development of automotive engineering processes, leading to direct\u000d\u000a      economic impacts for a number of manufacturing companies.\u000d\u000a    The collaboration between Red Bull F1 and QMUL allowed tyre models to be\u000d\u000a      made as building block components of a state-of-the-art vehicle simulator,\u000d\u000a      which included for the first time an accurate tyre model.

In\u000d\u000a      particular the detailed microstructural and micromechanics models [2,6]\u000d\u000a      have provided a significant stimulus which has resulted in us undertaking\u000d\u000a      extensive work in house using a similar approach to the one at QMUL of\u000d\u000a      adopting a computational model to help design rubber compounds at the\u000d\u000a      nano-scale\". Through this approach Bridgestone became the first tyre\u000d\u000a      manufacturer to gain the new EU A\/A rating for their Ecopia\u000d\u000a        EP tyres in October 2012, with top A grades on both fuel efficiency\u000d\u000a      and wet grip. By switching to Bridgestone Ecopia tyres the average\u000d\u000a      European car can save up to 70 litres of fuel per year (9,000 miles\/year)\u000d\u000a      which will reduce CO2 emissions by 160 kg. Or in other words if all new\u000d\u000a      cars registered in Europe (15 million) ran on Ecopia EP tyres this would\u000d\u000a      save up to 1 billion litres of fuel and reduce total CO2 emissions by 2,3\u000d\u000a      million tons per year (equivalent to 0.5% annual UK CO2 emissions).\u000d\u000a    The Materials Development and Testing Manager of Dunlop\u000d\u000a        Aircraft Tyres has commented that the project collaborating with\u000d\u000a      QMUL has helped them make significant progress in their efforts to develop\u000d\u000a      radial tyres for civil and military aircraft and bring them to market. He\u000d\u000a      comments that, \"Adopting the fracture mechanics characterisation based\u000d\u000a      upon earlier work done at QMUL [4] and coupled with finite element\u000d\u000a      modelling, they were able to resolve many problems and build tyres capable\u000d\u000a      of meeting the stringent qualification testing required prior to\u000d\u000a      installation on aircraft.

This knowledge allows us to design rubber\u000d\u000a      components ranging from vibration mounts that support large engineering\u000d\u000a      structures such as the new Penang Bridge in Malaysia, to much smaller\u000d\u000a      anti-vibration mounts used in automotive applications\".\u000d\u000a    A former chief R&amp;D Engineer at SuperAguri F1 who now works at\u000d\u000a      Mercedes F1 has commented that the collaboration with QMUL allowed a\u000d\u000a      detailed understanding of how tyre road interactions are developed in F1\u000d\u000a      for the first time. This impacted SuperAguri's understanding of how to\u000d\u000a      optimise the suspension configuration to improve performance. He goes on\u000d\u000a      to say: \"The project was extended at SuperAguri using a Queen Mary PhD\u000d\u000a      graduate to undertake track side analysis. This type of modelling was\u000d\u000a      pioneering at the time and is now standard practice amongst most F1\u000d\u000a      teams\". The fact that a QMUL graduate was employed by SuperAguri F1 as a\u000d\u000a      result of successful research collaboration leads to the significant\u000d\u000a      secondary impact described in this case.

The group,\u000a      teamed with MASS Ltd,\u000a      developed an Automatic Interference Monitoring System for Ofcom to examine\u000a      the increasingly\u000a      congested EM spectrum over 40 sites across the country during 2005-2007.\u000a      This work has\u000a      constituted a major contribution to the Ofcom Spectrum Framework Review\u000a      Report published in\u000a      April, 2008 [I6]. This technology enables Ofcom to monitor\/regulate the 3G\u000a      radio bands for better\u000a      mobile communication services.\u000a    2) Impact on the environment\u000a    With the integration of multiple functions on mobile phone handsets, the\u000a      EM emission from\u000a      different components has caused interference to the radio channels, which\u000a      burdens wireless\u000a      networks, causing excess power consumption. Sony-Ericsson, have\u000a      funded the group to develop\u000a      wideband test equipment for detecting EM interference on mobile terminals\u000a      since 2007 [I1].

Built on the group's\u000a      extensive expertise and experience in antenna engineering, Xiaodong Chen\u000a      (Professor, Reader at\u000a      that time) and his team consisting of Jiangxin Liang (PhD student, Sept.\u000a      2003 &#8212; Mar. 2006), Choo\u000a      Chiau (Research assistant, Mar. 2005 &#8212; June. 2007), Pengcheng Li (academic\u000a      visitor from Beijing\u000a      Institute of Telemetry, Sept. 2004 &#8212; Feb. 2006), Lu Guo (PhD student,\u000a      2004-2008) and Clive Parini\u000a      (Professor, Head of Group) proposed a printed version of the UWB monopole\u000a      for the first time, in\u000a      which the ground plane is printed on the substrate. Previously, planar UWB\u000a      monopoles were all\u000a      realized with a perpendicular ground plane. Furthermore, the QMUL group\u000a      identified the operating\u000a      mechanism of planar UWB antennas as the combination of overlapping\u000a      multiple resonances and\u000a      travelling waves [1]. This technical breakthrough has resulted in an\u000a      explosion of research work on\u000a      the printed version of UWB antennas worldwide. Chen was invited to\u000a      contribute to a book chapter\u000a      [2] and as a co-author to a book [3] on the subject. A variety of compact\u000a      UWB antennas were\u000a      developed in the group for various applications funded by the UK\u000a\u0009\u0009government and industry. The\u000a      principles of UWB antennas were further exploited for designing broadband\u000a      couplers for\u000a      deployment in ultra wideband power line communications under a DTI\/EPSRC\u000a      Technology\u000a      Programme project (Chen: EP\/D033950\/1).\u000a    The concept of UWB antennas as a compact wideband array for airborne\u000a      remote sensing was\u000a      successfully developed by Parini &amp; Chen via an industrial funded PhD\u000a      student (Sheng Wang 2006\u000a      &#8212; 2009) from Selex Galileo Ltd [I3]. A one year post doctorial follow on\u000a      programme of work was\u000a      supported by Selex-Galileo to develop a novel experimental calibration\u000a      technique for a 1024\u000a      element phased array for airborne military applications. No publication of\u000a      this prototype's\u000a      performance was permitted for security reasons.\u000a    The group was the first to apply UWB technology for body area networks in\u000a      collaboration with\u000a      University of Birmingham, which led to a book on the topic of body-centric\u000a      communications [4] and\u000a      several book chapter contributions. Work was supported by three EPSRC\u000a      research grants (&gt; &#163;2m)\u000a      both jointly held with Birmingham (2003-2013: GR\/S03812\/01, EP\/E030270\/1\u000a      &amp; EP\/I009019\/1).\u000a      The research has attracted early-stage researchers attending three EU\u000a      supported doctoral schools\u000a      held at Queen Mary (www.antennasvce.org\/Community\/Education\/Courses\/Locations,\u000a      European\u000a      School of Antennas). The work [5,6] was the first in the area of UWB for\u000a      body-centric networks and\u000a      is considered to be one of the most cited papers on UWB antennas effects\u000a      on the human body\u000a      propagation channel. The subsequent research activities in this field led\u000a      to the design and\u000a      evaluation of UWB antennas coupled with tunable electronic circuitry to be\u000a      used in smart and\u000a      cooperative personal and body area networks (Alomainy First grant EPSRC:\u000a      EP\/H048154\/1). The\u000a      group has recently secured a TSB grant for 12 months (Alomainy:\u000a      TS\/L000237\/1) to further\u000a      investigate the research challenges behind UWB localisation of human hands\u000a      and translate it into\u000a      potential commercial applications.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19092","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The domain of the impact of our research since 2008 has been in the area\u000d\u000a      of commercial forensic\u000d\u000a      science and analysis for Cellmark, and the use of these analyses supplied\u000d\u000a      by Cellmark in police\u000d\u000a      investigations and prosecutions across the UK.

The impact of this case study is underpinned by the\u000a      following research:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a1998-2003: Ross et al were the first to demonstrate that the\u000a        Intelligent Gravimetric\u000a        Analyzer (IGA) could be used to measure the diffusion of hydrogen in\u000a        metals - specifically\u000a        palladium-silver alloys foils [1]. Subsequent work on cycling\u000a        metal hydrogen systems using\u000a        IGA led to the development of in situ cycling experiments in neutron\u000a        diffractometers [2], a\u000a        technique that has been widely adopted in practice.\u000a      Surface coating techniques for reduction of H\/D\/T permeation through\u000a        structural metals\u000a        were first developed in connection with the design of the Next European\u000a        Torus. The critical\u000a        research concerned the sputtering of alumina on MANET [3] using\u000a        a novel unbalanced\u000a        magnetron sputtering technique developed at Salford [4]. These\u000a        techniques for reducing\u000a        H\/D\/T permeation reduced this quantity by ~4 orders of magnitude over a\u000a        wide range of\u000a        temperatures.\u000a      Ab-initio calculations of the potential energy surface seen by\u000a        hydrogen in palladium single\u000a        crystals has yielded values for the energies of (non-harmonic) excited\u000a        quantum states of\u000a        the proton and deuteron, and these results have been confirmed by\u000a        inelastic neutron\u000a        scattering measurements [5]. This work provides a `first\u000a        principles' approach to the\u000a        calculation of the chemical potential of H and D in palladium, allowing\u000a        a prediction of the\u000a        H\/D and D\/T separation factors, important for isotope separation in\u000a        fusion energy\u000a        development.\u000a      \u000a2004: Neutron inelastic scattering from hydrogen compounds\u000a        adsorbed by catalysts on\u000a        carbon substrates has proved a powerful way of identifying molecules on\u000a        surfaces in low\u000a        concentrations.

Using\u000a        Pd as a model system, the research found that thin films reproduce the\u000a        thermodynamic\u000a        parameters of bulk in desorption and a range of applications for\u000a        hydrogenography [15].\u000a      \u000a2010-onwards: Collaborations on practical methods for hydrogen\u000a        storage with industrial\u000a        partners involved car manufacturers eg., Daimler Chrysler, materials\u000a        manufacturers such\u000a        as Johnson-Matthey and other major companies in the Hydrogen-Fuel Cell\u000a        field.\u000a      \u000a2010-onwards.

Using high-k dielectric is essential for achieving a sub-28-nm\u000d\u000a      feature size. However, the large defect density in the high-03ba materials\u000d\u000a      causes complex electron trapping\/detrapping and is limiting its\u000d\u000a      application. Novel techniques are needed to characterise these defects for\u000d\u000a      the qualification and screening of new materials, processes, and device\u000d\u000a      structures when developing the next generation memory devices.\u000d\u000a    The existing techniques for characterising electron trapping in high-k\u000d\u000a      materials were developed for the logic CMOS devices, which targeted the\u000d\u000a      thin high-k gate dielectric stack in contact with the substrate directly.\u000d\u000a      These techniques are of limited use for memory devices, which use much\u000d\u000a      thicker high-k layers and have more complicated gate dielectric\u000d\u000a      structures: the slow DC techniques cannot probe the fast\u000d\u000a      trapping\/detrapping; the existing pulse techniques cannot probe the deep\u000d\u000a      traps in the dielectric bulk. These techniques are not suitable for\u000d\u000a      characterising the interaction of traps in different layers either, and\u000d\u000a      such interaction has a direct impact on the memory performance.

On the other hand, to avoid\u000d\u000a      disturbing the shallow traps during the measurement itself, a measurement\u000d\u000a      must be completed within microseconds. None of the existing techniques can\u000d\u000a      meet these conflicting time requirements simultaneously [R1.1-R1.6].\u000d\u000a    The RG1 made a breakthrough by developing a new 2-pulse technique, which\u000d\u000a      demonstrated, for the first time ever, that electron traps can be fully\u000d\u000a      charged\/discharged throughout the dielectric stack by applying a suitable\u000d\u000a      bias between the two pulses, and the measurements, taken on the fast pulse\u000d\u000a      edges, can \"freeze\" the trapping\/detrapping [R1.1]. This new technique can\u000d\u000a      successfully extract the energy regions and spatial locations of electron\u000d\u000a      traps over the whole high-k dielectric stacks used in new generations of\u000d\u000a      Flash memory, which is also confirmed by detailed modelling and simulation\u000d\u000a      [R1.2].\u000d\u000a    Lack of defect energy profiles: Detailed energy profile of\u000d\u000a      electron traps in high-k materials is required for characterising the\u000d\u000a      memory performance and, in turn, the qualification of new materials,\u000d\u000a      processes, and device structures. Existing techniques can only either\u000d\u000a      probe a limited energy range above silicon conduction band edge, or are\u000d\u000a      limited to traps near the substrate interface [R1.3].\u000d\u000a    Based on the success of the 2-pulse technique, a multi-pulse technique\u000d\u000a      was further developed specifically for probing the detailed energy\u000d\u000a      distribution of traps. Traps were first fully charged and then discharged,\u000d\u000a      level by level, under multiple consecutively decreasing biases. For the\u000d\u000a      first time ever, the energy distribution across the dielectric band gap is\u000d\u000a      successfully obtained [R1.3].\u000d\u000a    These pulse techniques have since been used in the development of new\u000d\u000a      memory devices in a number of aspects, including Material selection,\u000d\u000a      Process screening, Device structure optimisation, and Qualification\u000d\u000a      procedure (e.g. [R1.1-R1.6]).\u000d\u000a    The research above was carried out in collaboration with the Memory\u000d\u000a      Devices Consortium at IMEC, whose main roles are identifying the\u000d\u000a      inadequacy of existing techniques, providing in-kind support including\u000d\u000a      test samples, and demonstrating the capability of the pulse techniques to\u000d\u000a      users. In addition, IMEC served as a platform for delivering the impact,\u000d\u000a      as detailed in section 4.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21011","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This case study gives an example how the RG1 provides solutions to\u000d\u000a      practical problems by direct engagement with industrial partners. The main\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries are test engineers (e.g. those in the Logic Devices\u000d\u000a      Consortium at IMEC) and equipment suppliers (e.g. Keithley Instruments).\u000d\u000a      The details of the impact for each are given in what follows.\u000d\u000a    Keithley Instruments: Keithley, as a global prime test equipment\u000d\u000a      supplier, played a leading role in disseminating the new technique. After\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the new technique on the home-made facility [R2.1], the RG1\u000d\u000a      made an effort to maximise its reach and impact by working with\u000d\u000a    Keithley. By implementing the technique on the industrial-standard\u000d\u000a      equipment, it opened a channel for its dissemination to the Keithley's\u000d\u000a      world-wide customer base.\u000d\u000a    The RG1's activities in developing new measurement techniques have been\u000d\u000a      noted by Keithley and an agreement was signed with Keithley to implement\u000d\u000a      these new techniques on Keithley's instruments in 2010 [C2.1]. After the\u000d\u000a      take-over of Keithley by Tektronix, the collaboration agreement was\u000d\u000a      renewed in 2013 [C2.2]. Following the publication of the new technique for\u000d\u000a      mobility in 2012 [R2.1], Keithley noticed its advantages and \"believes\u000d\u000a      that equipping its instrument with such advanced techniques will give it a\u000d\u000a      competitive edge\" [C2.2], \"as it demonstrates the capability of 4200-SCS\u000d\u000a      and explores its application potential\" [C2.1]. Keithley provided its most\u000d\u000a      advanced ultra-fast pulse test module 4225 to the University to implement\u000d\u000a      this technique [C2.2]. By working together with Keithley, the RG1 made the\u000d\u000a      following key contributions:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      It demonstrated that the new technique can be implemented on the\u000d\u000a        industrial standard equipment, as reported in March 2013 [C2.3].\u000d\u000a      It prepared the application note no. 3236, authored by Z.Ji from the\u000d\u000a        RG1 [C2.1, C2.4]; the application note is available at Keithley's\u000d\u000a        website addresses given in [C2.4].\u000d\u000a      It prepared the control software [C2.1, C2.5], available through\u000d\u000a        Keithley's website given in [C2.5].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Keithley has been disseminating information about this technique to its\u000d\u000a      world-wide customers by highlighting it in its quarterly newsletter \"Test\u000d\u000a      Patterns\", which was also sent to its global customers by email [C2.6]. It\u000d\u000a      is drawing attention to this technique as one of the strengths for its\u000d\u000a      award-winning 4200-SCS instruments in its sales promotion [C2.1]. These\u000d\u000a      activities provide mechanisms for a global reach and impact. According to\u000d\u000a      the data provided by Keithley, 67 customers downloaded the application\u000d\u000a      notes on the same day when they received the email notification regarding\u000d\u000a      the new feature. Each 4200 instrument costs US$ 80k, but it offers\u000d\u000a      multi-functionality and it is difficult for Keithley to tell how many\u000d\u000a      customers purchased it just because of this new feature.\u000d\u000a    The Logic Devices Consortium at IMEC: The members of this\u000d\u000a      Consortium include Intel, Global Foundries, TSMC, Sony, Panasonic, and\u000d\u000a      Xilinx. The RG1 has collaborated with it for 20 years [C2.7].\u000d\u000a    The Consortium supported the research into a new technique by providing\u000d\u000a      three sets of test samples requested by the RG1: one set (2.3-nm SiO2)\u000d\u000a      as the benchmark and two sets for testing the applicability of the new\u000d\u000a      technique to samples of high trapping (1.65-nm HfSiON\/SiON) and high gate\u000d\u000a      leakage (1.28-nm HfSiON\/SiON). These samples were the same as those used\u000d\u000a      by the Consortium for technology development [C2.7].\u000d\u000a    As the users of the new technique, IMEC [C2.7] corroborates that \"the new\u000d\u000a      mobility measurement technique simplifies the test procedure without using\u000d\u000a      the expensive RF setup, has better accuracy and efficiency\". The\u000d\u000a      significance of the improvement is supported by the following quantitative\u000d\u000a      information:\u000d\u000a    (i) Reduced cost: The quotations received by the RG1 show\u000d\u000a      that a typical RF probe station costs approximately &#163;130k and it also\u000d\u000a      requires network analyser, such as Agilent PNA, costing over &#163;70k. In\u000d\u000a      addition, the test devices should have special RF structures, whose cost\u000d\u000a      is manufacturer-specific. All of these are not required for the new\u000d\u000a      technique.\u000d\u000a    (ii) Improved reliability: The commercial capacitance metre\u000d\u000a      can only tolerate gate leakage below 10 A\/cm2, which is lower\u000d\u000a      than the gate leakage in advanced transistors. The capacitance measured by\u000d\u000a      the new technique is independent of gate leakage and it has been\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that mobility can be extracted with a gate leakage as high as\u000d\u000a      40 A\/cm2 [R2.1, R2.2].\u000d\u000a    (iii) Better accuracy: The drain voltage mismatch induces\u000d\u000a      an error over 20% and the charge trapping can cause an additional 20%\u000d\u000a      error [R2.1, R2.2]. These errors were eliminated by the new technique.\u000d\u000a    (iv) Improved efficiency: The existing technique measures\u000d\u000a      current and mobile charges separately, whilst the new technique measures\u000d\u000a      them simultaneously, so that the number of tests is halved [R2.1, R2.2].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Carrier mobility is a key parameter for the semiconductor industry, but\u000d\u000a      its measurement is characterised by poor accuracy and unreliability for\u000d\u000a      advanced transistors.

Transistor speed is\u000d\u000a      characterised by the electron mobility, so that its measurement is\u000d\u000a      essential for evaluating new materials and processes in the semiconductor\u000d\u000a      industry. The standard measurement technique is based on the split\u000d\u000a      capacitance-voltage (Split-CV), but it increasingly suffers from poor\u000d\u000a      accuracy and unreliability as transistors become smaller. Smaller\u000d\u000a      transistors cause problems, since they have higher gate leakage\u000d\u000a      and use materials with higher charge trapping. Moreover, the\u000d\u000a      existing techniques measure the capacitance and conduction current under\u000d\u000a      different drain voltages, and this drain voltage mismatch\u000d\u000a      introduces unacceptable errors for the small transistors operating at low\u000d\u000a      voltage.\u000d\u000a    Early attempts to resolve these problems only had limited successes and\u000d\u000a      required expensive set-up and complex procedures [R2.1]. During this REF\u000d\u000a      period, a new technique has been developed and demonstrated, which\u000d\u000a      overcomes the shortcomings mentioned above without using expensive set-up,\u000d\u000a      as detailed below.\u000d\u000a    Drain voltage mismatch: To extract mobility, one needs both the\u000d\u000a      conduction current and the mobile charge. In principle, they should be\u000d\u000a      measured under the same drain voltage. The existing technique, however,\u000d\u000a      measures conduction current with non-zero drain voltage, while mobile\u000d\u000a      charge is measured with zero drain voltage, because the signal for mobile\u000d\u000a      charge would be buried by conduction current if non-zero drain voltage\u000d\u000a      were applied. This drain voltage mismatch leads to unacceptable errors for\u000d\u000a      advanced transistors [R2.1, R2.2].\u000d\u000a    An early career researcher from the Microelectronics Research Group,\u000d\u000a      Z.Ji, made a breakthrough by proposing and demonstrating, for the first\u000d\u000a      time ever, that conduction current and mobile charge could be measured\u000d\u000a      simultaneously under the same drain voltage, eliminating the drain voltage\u000d\u000a      mismatch. By raising the ramping rate of gate bias one million times over\u000d\u000a      its conventional level through applying an ultra-fast pulse, the\u000d\u000a      displacement current becomes high enough for measuring mobile charge and\u000d\u000a      will no longer be buried by conduction current [R2.1, R2.2].\u000d\u000a    Gate Leakage: As the gate oxide is downscaled close to one\u000d\u000a      nano-meter, large gate leakage buries the signal of high frequency\u000d\u000a      capacitance meter used for the split-CV [R2.3, R2.4], making the\u000d\u000a      measurement unreliable. To make signal strong enough, the frequency has to\u000d\u000a      rise to the radio frequency (RF) or even GHz range. This, however,\u000d\u000a      requires the costly RF probe station, the network analyser, and complex\u000d\u000a      test structure. In the new technique, the effect of gate leakage on\u000d\u000a      capacitance was cancelled out by subtracting the displacement current at\u000d\u000a      the two pulse edges. The measured capacitance becomes inherently\u000d\u000a      independent of the gate leakage, overcoming a major obstacle without using\u000d\u000a      expensive set-up.\u000d\u000a    Charge trapping: As high-k dielectric replaces the conventional\u000d\u000a      SiON, charge trapping in gate dielectric increases. The slow conventional\u000d\u000a      technique gives time for the trapping to take place during measurement\u000d\u000a      and, consequently, the measured mobile charge includes the trapped\u000d\u000a      charges.

The first two of these were the micron data modem [E2, E5] and\u000a      MicronNav USBL tracking system [E3,E5] which incorporate Newcastle's\u000a      Doppler tolerant spread spectrum signalling and range\/angle estimation\u000a      algorithms. These products now provide tracking for the majority of\u000a      miniature underwater vehicles being sold worldwide. Over 300 licences have\u000a      been issued by the University to date with a sales value of &#163;2M. The\u000a        market for these devices is growing rapidly, currently accounting for\u000a        around 10% of company turnover in a business employing ~100 people.\u000a      The most recent product introduced is the high performance AM400 acoustic\u000a      modem [E4, E5] which incorporates all of the underpinning research outputs\u000a      and has demonstrated unparalleled performance in terms of data rate (up to\u000a      32kbits\/s) and range (up to 10km). This has enabled the company to win\u000a      contracts for high value bespoke systems, to operate in very severe\u000a      channel conditions where competing products are completely unable to\u000a      operate, and the university has issued 6 licences corresponding to around\u000a      &#163;300k of sales since 2010. These products represent major steps forward in\u000a      performance, miniaturisation and cost, which wouldn't have been possible\u000a      without Newcastle's innovative signal processing [E5].\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a    Impact on the subsea industry\u000a    The MicronNav USBL and micron modem products have provided a reliable,\u000a      cost effective and miniaturised solution for the tracking of small\u000a      underwater robotic vehicles. This is now the preferred solution\u000a        adopted by vehicle manufacturers such as Seabotix Inc [E6] and Videoray\u000a        Inc who account for the majority of the world market. Many end\u000a      users, including the US and Canadian Navy [E7], have found the ability to\u000a      accurately track these vehicles invaluable in rapidly locating and\/or\u000a      tagging seabed targets. The combination of accurate tracking and data\u000a      communication in one miniature unit has also led to its deployment on\u000a      several autonomous underwater vehicles under development around the world\u000a      [E8]. Likewise high performance AM400 modems delivered by Tritech have\u000a      enabled very challenging operations to be carried out. A good example of\u000a      this is the remote collection of large data files from subsea tidal\u000a      turbine near Orkney, overcoming severe noise and wake effects and a\u000a      hostile 5km shallow water channel.\u000a    Impact on diver safety\u000a    Inspired by the death of a well known diver, the IET and the British Sub\u000a      Aqua Club (BSAC) launched an international competition to challenge\u000a      engineers to develop an affordable system to track and monitor the world's\u000a      estimated 3 million divers. The Newcastle group and Tritech teamed up to\u000a      develop low cost prototypes for a diver personal transponder and surface\u000a      interrogator based on the successful spread spectrum concepts. 4 teams\u000a      from around the world entered devices but, after successful trials by BSAC\u000a      divers in Scotland, the Newcastle-Tritech design was declared the winner\u000a      [E9] and the team were presented with an award and prize money by the IET.\u000a      BSAC described this as one of the most significant contributions to\u000a        diver safety in the last 50 years and could help to reduce the estimated\u000a        100 deaths each year in diving accidents. Since 2008 Tritech have\u000a      delivered several systems for diving applications, enabling multiple\u000a      divers to be tracked from the surface, to receive commands and to signal\u000a      if they get into difficulty. Working with another commercial partner, a\u000a      mass market product accessible to all recreational divers is undergoing\u000a      final testing at the time of writing ahead of a product release.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a    Impact on the environment\u000a    Another positive impact brought about by the research is the reduced\u000a      impact on marine life, since some environmental groups estimate that up to\u000a      10 million whales\/dolphins are affected by high power acoustic systems per\u000a      year. Both the spread spectrum technology and the adaptive array receivers\u000a      dramatically reduce the required acoustic source power for a given range.\u000a      The AM400 product emits a total acoustic power of approximately 10W\u000a        which is up to 10 times lower than competing systems intended for the\u000a        same range. Similarly the Micron modem and USBL products may operate\u000a      over 1km radius without exceeding the safe limit on acoustic intensity\u000a      suggested by marine biologists of approximately 100mW\/m2.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The commercialisation of Newcastle University's pioneering research in\u000a      underwater acoustic communication has created market leading products,\u000a      achieving economic impact, enhanced subsea operations, an award for\u000a      improved diver safety and reduced impact of subsea acoustic emissions on\u000a      marine mammals.

Early modem designs employed\u000a      simple analog technology which was unable to meet industry demands for\u000a      data rate, range and reliability. Such systems failed to address the\u000a      extreme multipath\/reverberation, noise and Doppler effects encountered in\u000a      the underwater channel, typically 100-10,000x greater in magnitude than in\u000a      radio communications. The research underpinning these improved products\u000a      was performed from 1994-2005 by Prof Oliver Hinton, Prof Bayan Sharif and\u000a      RA Jeffrey Neasham.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a    During work funded by G1, the team introduced bandwidth efficient, phase\u000a      shift keying modulation where less efficient schemes such as frequency\u000a      shift keying had previously dominated, increasing data throughput by an\u000a      order of magnitude. This was enabled by the development of sophisticated\u000a      adaptive receivers [P1][P5], employing arrays of receiving transducers, to\u000a      overcome the multipath\/reverberation problem. These innovations led to\u000a      reliable transmission at data rates of the order of 20kbits\/s through\u000a      severe multipath channels spanning hundreds of symbols and with rapid\u000a      fluctuations in path amplitude and phase. Understanding of underwater\u000a      adaptive array receivers was further enhanced during G2 and G5-7, leading\u000a      to the demonstration of very long range, multi-user networks [P2].\u000a    During G3 and G4, the group then developed novel algorithms to estimate\u000a      and remove the extreme Doppler effects occurring with moving platforms and\u000a      which previously led to loss of synchronisation. A journal article on this\u000a      subject remains one of the most cited references in the field of\u000a      underwater communication with 187 citations [P3]. The later development of\u000a      closed-loop tracking techniques allowed synchronisation to be maintained\u000a      between highly dynamic platforms such as small robotic underwater vehicles\u000a      and naval submarines [P4] with Doppler shifts of 1-2%.\u000a    The robust signals designed for synchronisation were then adapted to form\u000a      an extremely reliable, spread spectrum communication system for low bit\u000a      rate command\/control applications. This is able to operate with SNR as low\u000a      as &#8212; 10dB (noise power is 10 times higher than the received signal power).\u000a      Furthermore, by virtue of its broadband signal correlation, the same\u000a      hardware was able to deliver range and direction information accurate to\u000a      10cm and 1 degree respectively.\u000a    From 2003 onwards the group collaborated with Tritech to develop a number\u000a      of high performance demonstrator systems based on the above technologies,\u000a      including modems for:\u000a    \u000a      The ALIVE autonomous intervention vehicle, achieving a world first by\u000a        carrying out maintenance on a 500m deep installation entirely by\u000a        acoustic communication of commands, video and sonar data.\u000a      The Halliburton Geosub Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for subsea\u000a        geological surveying.\u000a      The continuous reception of current meter data in a shallow estuary\u000a        channel, with busy shipping traffic, where acoustic emissions had to be\u000a        limited due to concern over harbour porpoise populations [P5].\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21777","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aIn the current environment where there is increasing demand for volume and speed of electronic\u000d\u000aactivity combined with environmental concerns, asynchronous chips (a faster and more power\u000d\u000aefficient technology) has been welcomed by industry and users. The pathway to this impact has\u000d\u000abeen, over the last 20 years, laid through influential research dissemination by the Newcastle\u000d\u000agroup, having the highest publication track record in the history of the IEEE International\u000d\u000aSymposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems, amongst the entire international\u000d\u000aasynchronous circuits and systems community. Newcastle has had close and never-stopping\u000d\u000ainteraction with the industrial members of this community, which includes several leading scientists\u000d\u000aand engineers from Intel, Sun (now Oracle), Fulcrum (now Intel).\u000d\u000aThe research has enabled automated construction of asynchronous circuits\u000d\u000aThe results of research described in this case study have been used as the basis for Intel\u000d\u000aCorporation's Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for asynchronous circuits. In his letter [E3],\u000d\u000aIntel's Chief Scientist for Technology Development identified the longstanding problem of high\u000d\u000alevels of complexity that the inherent concurrency of asynchronous circuits pose to industrial\u000d\u000adesigners, and stated that \"The predominant means of analysing this concurrency is Petri Nets and\u000d\u000athe work by Alex Yakovlev and his colleagues have pioneered the application of Petri Nets to\u000d\u000aasynchronous circuits\" [E3].\u000d\u000aSpecifically STGs, Petrify and related Petri net theories have provided (i) the basis of\u000d\u000aunderstanding and modelling performance analysis as well as optimisation of asynchronous\u000d\u000acircuits, and (ii) the formal basis of the slack matching optimisation algorithm (patented by Fulcrum\u000d\u000aMicrosystem [E4]) which is a key technology for asynchronous circuits design. In combination,\u000d\u000atogether, (i) and (ii) have allowed Intel to produce higher performance asynchronous circuits\u000d\u000a(\"Slack matching is one of the core technologies within the asynchronous CAD flow that my Intel\u000d\u000adivision is using and this process is a pillar to us achieving higher performance than the\u000d\u000asynchronous alternatives in our past two products\" [E3]).\u000d\u000aIntel's press release on the acquisition of Fulcrum Microsystems stated: \"Fulcrum Microsystems'\u000d\u000a[asynchronous] switch silicon, already recognized for high performance and low latency,\u000d\u000acomplements Intel's leading processors and Ethernet controllers, and will deliver our customers\u000d\u000anew levels of performance and energy efficiency while improving their economics of cloud service\u000d\u000adelivery.\" [E8].\u000d\u000aThe impact is evident in the wide deployment of the new circuits in the financial services industry;\u000d\u000ain particular, most transactions on the NYSE and NASDAQ (combined daily volume of trade\u000d\u000aexceeding &#163;80 billion) now rely on Intel's switch silicon &#8212; a design facilitated by the use of new\u000d\u000aCAD tools that depend on the research described earlier [E3]. Gartner Analysts reported that for\u000d\u000athe years 2010-2012 the total annual worldwide semiconductor revenue was on average $300\u000d\u000abillion. Intel Corporation had 16% of this market and was the world leading manufacturer of chips\u000d\u000afor high-performance computers (\"no.1 semiconductor vendor for the 21st year in a row\").\u000d\u000aTools &amp; techniques for improving synchroniser design has been adopted by industry\u000d\u000aIntel Corporation and Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) have used research results to\u000d\u000aimprove measurement techniques and robustness in their synchronisers. Benefits include new\u000d\u000acircuits and the valuable analysis capability of new tools, the ideas for which were triggered by\u000d\u000aProf. Kinniment's methods to measure deep metastability and MTBF (Mean Time Between\u000d\u000aFailures). The research has allowed better understanding of metastability, improved confidence in\u000d\u000aperformance estimation of circuits and enabled previously unknown effects to be revealed, which\u000d\u000asignificantly enhances system reliability [E1, E2].\u000d\u000aAs a result, faster and more power efficient synchronisers have been produced by Sun\u000d\u000aMicrosystems in their desktop and server machines (Sun UltraSparc series), during 2008-2009\u000d\u000a(and pre-2008). From 2010 Oracle (who bought Sun Microsystems) has continued using research\u000d\u000aresults to create the improved SPARC series of products [E2]. As a result of using synchronisers\u000d\u000athat have been designed and characterised using Newcastle's methods Oracle have been able to\u000d\u000ascale up the performance of their processors without reducing their reliability. The SPARC\u000d\u000aprocessors are world leaders in terms of processing speed and several records have been broken\u000d\u000a[E5, E6] allowing Oracle to compete with other providers like IBM. The Transaction Processing\u000d\u000aPerformance Council, whose membership includes the major businesses in the field, indicate\u000d\u000aOracle SPARC products as top ranking in the performance category [E7].\u000d\u000aIn 2013, the SPARC microprocessor was released by Oracle as the world's fastest microprocessor\u000d\u000a[E6].

The design of communication fabrics in complex systems on chip becomes\u000d\u000aincreasingly more asynchronous (domain a). This creates a large demand for design techniques to\u000d\u000ainterface these communication fabrics to local data processing cores, and such interfaces need to\u000d\u000aprovide high performance reliable synchronization to the local timing regions (domain b).\u000d\u000aIn (a), research has provided a solution to the longstanding problem of developing a modelling\u000d\u000atechnique that describes concurrent behaviour of asynchronous systems. The foundations of our\u000d\u000acontributions in this area were established since the 1990s when Prof. Yakovlev produced the\u000d\u000aunified model of Signal Transition Graphs (STG) [P1], which has now become a standard notation\u000d\u000afor synthesis of controllers and interfaces in multi-synchronous systems on chip. This model and\u000d\u000aassociated tools have a pivotal role in making Petri nets a formal semantic kernel of the new\u000d\u000aasynchronous system design flow, similar to that of finite state machines in synchronous system\u000d\u000adesign. The STG model has given a way to capturing highly concurrent behaviour typical for\u000d\u000aasynchronous systems in a very compact form, without exponential state explosion inherent in\u000d\u000astate machine modelling methods.\u000d\u000aNewcastle's joint research on synthesis methods using STG &amp; Petri nets with collaborators from\u000d\u000aPolytechnics of Catalonia and Turin, Cadence and Intel Corporation has produced the software\u000d\u000atool Petrify. This tool, described in a widely cited paper [P2], was released into the public domain in\u000d\u000a2000 and subsequently has become widely used in academia and industry. The key innovative\u000d\u000afeatures of the new synthesis method used in Petrify was the development and application of\u000d\u000atheory of regions to solving complete state coding in STGs, implementation of STG specifications\u000d\u000ain semi-modular and speed-independent circuits, and the development and application of the idea\u000d\u000aof relative timing for logic optimisation. They are all described in the monograph [P3] that, together\u000d\u000awith the Petrify tool, was awarded the status of Finalist in the 2002 Descartes Prize competition.\u000d\u000aIn (b), research has focussed on the problem of accurate characterisation of metastability,\u000d\u000adeveloping practical methods for on-chip measurement of deep metastability, evaluating the\u000d\u000aeffects of front and back edges of the clock on metastability resolution time, characterising failures\u000d\u000aand mean-time between failures (MTBF) in a range of synchronisers [P4].\u000d\u000aOver the last decade, the industrial need for accurate modelling of metastability and for robust\u000d\u000asynchronisers has steadily increased, due to the rapid growth of computer system complexity.\u000d\u000aNewcastle's robust synchronisers, based on supply voltage adaptation and pipelining, are crucial\u000d\u000ato the reliability of modern and future computer systems because they consist of hundreds of\u000d\u000aprocessors, independently clocked, powered and connected by asynchronous networks. This\u000d\u000aresearch has lead to identifying an important design trade-off between synchronization time and\u000d\u000areliability. In the EPSRC-funded project (SYRINGE), in collaboration with Intel Corporation,\u000d\u000aNewcastle's researchers developed innovative methods of metastability analysis and design of\u000d\u000arobust synchronisers which have extended mean-time between failures (MTBFs) to 3-5 years [P4].\u000d\u000aIn 2008, the proposed on-chip metastability measurement techniques were applied to develop a\u000d\u000anew robust synchroniser tolerant to variations in voltage supply, external temperature and process\u000d\u000avariability [P5]. This work was later extended, in collaboration with IMEC Netherlands, to the\u000d\u000acharacterisation of the performance of synchronizers in the sub-threshold mode [P6], thereby\u000d\u000aenabling ultra-low power applications in medicine and energy-harvesting.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"21782","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1880251","Name":"Singapore"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Newcastle University's PEDM group has a substantial history of research\u000a      collaborations with\u000a      manufacturers of consumer products, including Black and Decker, LG and\u000a      Electrolux and in\u000a      particular we have had a fruitful research relationship with Dyson\u000a      spanning the last decade.

Our interests in the specific\u000a      topic of sensorless control\u000a      originated in the research of Prof P Acarnley who identified a novel\u000a      method of determining motor\u000a      position based upon the use of motor terminal voltages and line currents\u000a      to estimate winding flux\u000a      linkages and thus predict motor position [P1]. Acarnley continued\u000a      to be a major contributor to the\u000a      development of various sensorless control methods ([P3] and [G4])\u000a      and his work was further\u000a      supplemented by Atkinson, Jack and Mecrow [P2] who applied\u000a      sensorless position estimation and\u000a      control methods to fault tolerant drives.\u000a    Newcastle research in this area is particularly relevant to the design of\u000a      consumer products, such as\u000a      vacuum cleaners, which provide greatest efficiency and minimum mass when\u000a      operating at ultra\u000a      high speeds. Almost all consumer products use brushed motors because of\u000a      the high cost of\u000a      power electronics and control for brushless alternatives. This has\u000a      resulted in inefficient systems,\u000a      with maximum speed typically limited to less than 40,000 revs\/min by the\u000a      brushgear. Newcastle\u000a      has been working to overcome this by researching and implementing low cost\u000a      brushless drives\u000a      operating at speeds of 100,000 revs\/min or greater [P4], enabling\u000a      them to be both smaller and\u000a      more efficient. The research areas have included new motor topologies, use\u000a      of new materials,\u000a      new drive topologies and novel control schemes, based upon our extensive\u000a      history of researching\u000a      these topics.\u000a    A key research project, part funded by Dyson, investigated low cost\u000a      sensorless schemes for ultra\u000a      high speed drives. The research built on Newcastle's expertise in\u000a      sensorless control schemes to\u000a      develop a controller for single phase drives of the type used by Dyson.\u000a      Single phase drives pose\u000a      particular problems. Unlike three- phase drives, the single phase winding\u000a      is always active, which\u000a      immediately rules out most existing sensorless schemes. Two low cost\u000a      sensorless schemes were\u000a      developed: the first scheme is used during current control mode and\u000a      determines the rotor position\u000a      from analysis of the active waveforms in the phase windings; the second\u000a      scheme is used in voltage\u000a      control mode and indirectly determines the rotor position by estimation of\u000a      the back emf via some\u000a      low cost hardware. When used together the schemes operate across all loads\u000a      and the entire\u000a      speed range &#8212; from standstill to over 110,000 rev\/min. This research has\u000a      resulted in 2 patent\u000a      applications [E1, E2].\u000a    The reported research was conducted by the Power Electronics Drives and\u000a      Machines (PEDM)\u000a      Group at Newcastle University over the period 1997 to 2013 and was led by\u000a      Prof Barrie Mecrow\u000a      (97-date), Prof P Acarnley (94-09) and Prof Alan Jack (97-10), with\u000a      further significant contributions\u000a      from Prof J Finch (97-09) and Dr DJ Atkinson (97-present), all of whom\u000a      were employed at\u000a      Newcastle University.\u000a    The PEDM group research in this area in the period 1993-date has\u000a      attracted over half a million\u000a      pounds of Dyson direct funding [G1, G2, G3] in\u000a      addition to ESPRC support in the form of individual\u000a      and platform grants [G4, G5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21783","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Dr Farsi at Newcastle between 1993-97 led to the development\u000d\u000a      of CANopen, a fieldbus communication protocol that provides a flexible and\u000d\u000a      powerful open industrial communication solution for connecting multiple\u000d\u000a      different manufacturer's devices. This protocol became the de-facto\u000d\u000a      European standard EN50325-4 (CiA 301) for CAN (Controller Area Network)\u000d\u000a      based automation solutions (E8), and opened up the market by\u000d\u000a      providing industry with the option of not being reliant specifically to\u000d\u000a      any one supplier. It is widely used by major companies within different\u000d\u000a      industries, with current sales of CAN nodes in the automotive industry\u000d\u000a      alone accounting for over 700 million units per year (E9).\u000d\u000a    Impact on practitioners and legislation:\u000d\u000a      The completed CANopen protocol specification was handed over to CAN in\u000d\u000a      Automation (CiA). CiA is a non-profit international industry organisation\u000d\u000a      whose aim is to promote CAN (Controller Area Network) and to provide a\u000d\u000a      path for future developments of the protocol through technical, product\u000d\u000a      and marketing information. It actively supports international\u000d\u000a      standardisation of CAN-related standards (E3). CiA released the\u000d\u000a      first stable CANopen specification (CiA 301 version 3.0) in 1995. Within\u000d\u000a      the next few years CiA declared that \"it became the most important\u000d\u000a        standardised embedded network in Europe\". Regular updates have since\u000d\u000a      been released with CiA currently working on a new updated version to allow\u000d\u000a      interface support for improved data transmission rates. (E1, E2)\u000d\u000a    Summarising the contribution made by Newcastle University on the initial\u000d\u000a      CANopen specification the CiA Managing Director commented that (E1):\u000d\u000a      \"The EN 50325-4 international standard (CiA 301 application layer and\u000d\u000a        communication profile) would not have been introduced without the\u000d\u000a        underlying scientific R&amp;D work undertaken at Newcastle University by\u000d\u000a        Dr Mohammed Farsi.\"\u000d\u000a    Impact on commercial organisations:\u000d\u000a      CANopen defines a complete framework for low-cost flexible device\u000d\u000a      independent systems. Aided by the introduction of the second generation of\u000d\u000a      CANopen networks in 2007 and a new communication profile in 2011. These\u000d\u000a      along with additional support for connecting different devices provide\u000d\u000a      important reasons why industrial segments still widely use and provide\u000d\u000a      CANopen support in their products today. The CiA Managing Director\u000d\u000a      stressed the importance and significance of CANopen to industry by\u000d\u000a      commenting (E1):\u000d\u000a    \"Over the time, CiA members have developed more than 60 devices,\u000d\u000a        applications, and interface profiles. This has encouraged industries to\u000d\u000a        buy low-cost, off-the-shelf devices and device vendors to provide\u000d\u000a        end-to-end CANopen solutions. Some of the major companies supplying\u000d\u000a        CANopen solutions around the world since 1999 include Siemens Medical\u000d\u000a        Systems, GE Healthcare, Volkswagen, Toyota and Putzmeister. These\u000d\u000a        companies cover a wide variety of industries such as automotive, medical\u000d\u000a        devices, rail vehicles, laboratory equipment, building automation and\u000d\u000a        control systems for renewable energy. Chipmakers such as Freescale,\u000d\u000a        Fujitsu, Infineon, Microchip, NXP and Renesas support the CANopen\u000d\u000a        protocol by means of third party products. The European Space Agency has\u000d\u000a        implemented CANopen in hardware for space applications.\"\u000d\u000a    In the early 1990s, Siemens Medical Solutions were faced with an\u000d\u000a      ever-growing demand for more functionality combined with market pressure\u000d\u000a      to reduce the cost of medical equipment. Siemens engineers looked at the\u000d\u000a      automotive industry for guidance and decided that CAN would form the\u000d\u000a      communication backbone of the next generation of products (E4).\u000d\u000a      Siemens incorporate embedded CANopen networks to various sub-systems in\u000d\u000a      several of its diagnostic medical devices. In 2009, the Catholic Medical\u000d\u000a      Center in Seoul, Korea ordered 70 systems of medical equipment\u000d\u000a      incorporating embedded CANopen networks for eight hospitals. Worth around\u000d\u000a      28 million Euros, the order is one of the biggest of its kind in the\u000d\u000a      medical industry worldwide (E5).\u000d\u000a    In 2008, European scientists working for CERN started high-energy\u000d\u000a      physics experiments hoping to discover among other things the Higgs\u000d\u000a      particles. The scientists designed and developed several detectors for the\u000d\u000a      Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which took a decade to construct at a \u000d\u000a        cost of approximately $4.75 billion. The Detector Control System\u000d\u000a      (DCS) is partly based on CANopen network systems. The DCS had the task to\u000d\u000a      permit coherent and safe operation of other large detectors (some\u000d\u000a      accounting for 60 million electronic channels) and to serve as a\u000d\u000a      consistent interface to all sub-detectors and technical infrastructure of\u000d\u000a      the experiment. Many other European high-energy research institutes have\u000d\u000a      also used CANopen-based systems for more than 10 years in a broad range of\u000d\u000a      applications (E7).\u000d\u000a    Sevcon Ltd. operate in the global market for electrically powered\u000d\u000a      vehicles with annual sales of over $35m, and have adopted CANopen for the\u000d\u000a      forklift truck sector and standardised on it over 10 years ago. Sevcon\u000d\u000a      Vice President (Engineering) states the reasoning: \"It provides support\u000d\u000a        for connecting different devices from a range of manufacturers which is\u000d\u000a        one of the important reasons why it is widely used and why Sevcon\u000d\u000a        provides CANopen support in our products today. CANopen is standard on\u000d\u000a        all our AC motor controller range and has been designed into all the new\u000d\u000a        motor control products we have developed over the last ten years\" (E6).\u000d\u000a    Impact on economic prosperity:\u000d\u000a      CiA has around 580 companies who are members of this international users\u000d\u000a      and manufacturers group (E1). To try and quantify the market value\u000d\u000a      of CANopen, the Managing Director of CiA provides an estimation of the\u000d\u000a      manufacturers' (producing CAN interfaces) sales figures by calculation and\u000d\u000a      estimation (E9):\u000d\u000a    We know the annual number of cars produced (60 million cars per year),\u000d\u000a        multiply them by the average number of CAN nodes in a car (high-end cars\u000d\u000a        have 80 ECUs (Engine Control Units), mid-range cars about 40 ECUs and\u000d\u000a        low-end cars just a few). The total average number is about 12 ECUs per\u000d\u000a        car, thus, resulting in about 720 million CAN nodes per year. The\u000d\u000a        automotive market is approximately 80% of the total CAN market.\u000d\u000a        Depending on the forecast for future car production volumes, CiA\u000d\u000a        estimates that in 2015 the use of CAN nodes will reach 1 billion\/year.\u000d\u000a    The estimated number of sold CAN transceivers, stated by NXP (market\u000d\u000a        leader in the semi-conductor industry), provides a figure of\u000d\u000a        approximately 800 million CAN interfaces for 2013. Although the\u000d\u000a        provision of CAN interfaces on the marketplace is huge, there is no\u000d\u000a        exact figure on how many use the CANopen technology. It is known that\u000d\u000a        80% of the wind power systems use CANopen for controlling the pitch\u000d\u000a        control system movement. Worldwide there are over two hundred\u000d\u000a      thousand wind turbines operating, with a total capacity of 282,482 MW at\u000d\u000a      the end of 2012 (E10). If we multiply each by seven (three\u000d\u000a        encoders, three drives, and one controller) then we have a total in\u000d\u000a        excess of 1.4 million CANopen interfaces in use.\u000d\u000a    From these examples alone, it is clear that the overall financial effects\u000d\u000a      from the CANopen technology form a worldwide billion dollar industry.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research during the 1990's at Newcastle University resulted in the\u000d\u000a      development of CANopen (Control Area Network open), a manufacturer\u000d\u000a      independent communication protocol for connecting multiple devices used in\u000d\u000a      industrial systems.

Therefore, Bosch's\u000d\u000a      long term vision to create a single open standard network based on CAN\u000d\u000a      that could cover a whole factory floor, allowing vendor independent\u000d\u000a      devices to be used.\u000d\u000a    In 1993, research led by Dr. Farsi in Newcastle University and\u000d\u000a      collaborators in Germany under ESPRIT III project [G1] led to the\u000d\u000a      development of the `CANopen protocol' specification. The main objective of\u000d\u000a      this project was to enable European industries to gain full access to the\u000d\u000a      benefits of this open protocol and become competitive in flexible\u000d\u000a      manufacturing and independent of technologies coming from the US and\u000d\u000a      Japan. Bosch led and coordinated the project, installing and testing the\u000d\u000a      developed prototype outputs to investigate whether they were implementable\u000d\u000a      within a manufacturing environment. Newcastle University carried out a\u000d\u000a      technology review in a manufacturing environment to ascertain the best\u000d\u000a      methods to be used to form the open standard. Newcastle researchers Mr\u000d\u000a      Karl Ratcliff and Dr Roy Booth then worked on the software development\u000d\u000a      (i.e. Layer 7) of a simple to use method to interface the CAN to\u000d\u000a      applications, which in turn led to the CANopen protocol. This Layer 7\u000d\u000a      software formed the interface that provided the effective communication\u000d\u000a      link between different manufacturer's devices operating over a network.\u000d\u000a    An open system architecture was designed and implemented for a low cost\u000d\u000a      flexible production unit for assembly, inspection and sequential tasks.\u000d\u000a      This introduced the important device profiling concept, which provided a\u000d\u000a      framework allowing manufacturers to independently develop their own\u000d\u000a      hardware products certain in the knowledge that their equipment would be\u000d\u000a      fully compatible with other manufacturers [1]. Further industrial\u000d\u000a      system implementations illustrated a new concept in device communication\u000d\u000a      within a manufacturing environment [2]. CANopen Configure Device\u000d\u000a      and Test (CDT) software was developed to facilitate the configuring and\u000d\u000a      testing of CANopen devices, allowing the use of CANopen compliant object\u000d\u000a      dictionaries to communicate with a device [3].\u000d\u000a    To support the adoption of CAN and CANopen into European companies and\u000d\u000a      enhance knowledge, Newcastle University presented details of the\u000d\u000a      technologies at workshops, manufacturing exhibitions and conferences. The\u000d\u000a      CAN concept, structure and operating principle, along with the software\u000d\u000a      and hardware implementation methods were explained [4]. The methods\u000d\u000a      of using CAN hardware in a CANopen context, in which CAN objects are\u000d\u000a      transmitted depending on services and response times were published [5].\u000d\u000a      The main benefits to a company using the CANopen technology were pseudo\u000d\u000a      real-time, robustness, inexpensive, simple to use with only 8 bytes of\u000d\u000a      information and most importantly it's flexibility to industry.\u000d\u000a    The outcome of the ESPRIT III project &#8212; CANopen protocol specification\u000d\u000a      was handed over to the CiA for future development and maintenance and by\u000d\u000a      the end of 1995; the completely revised CANopen communications profile was\u000d\u000a      released. The success of the CANopen protocol resulted in a further\u000d\u000a      dissemination EEC CANopen project [G2] in 1996. The project\u000d\u000a      established Newcastle University as the sole specialist centre in Britain\u000d\u000a      for this technology and development of CANopen Conformance Testing. A\u000d\u000a      document `CANopen Implementation made simple' by Newcastle University was\u000d\u000a      handed over to CiA in 1998 and distributed worldwide to companies\u000d\u000a      interested in implementing CANopen. A book explaining the details of a\u000d\u000a      CANopen implementation applicable to an industrial network was published\u000d\u000a      in 2000 [6].\u000d\u000a    The most important outcome of the project was the acceptance of CANopen\u000d\u000a      as an international standard (EN 50325-4 or CiA301) in 1999, which\u000d\u000a      provided higher level protocols to CAN reference model standardized by\u000d\u000a      International Standard Organization (ISO\/OSI 11898), for industrial and\u000d\u000a      embedded control networks.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21798","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Both consumer opinion and legislation increasingly propose reduction\u000d\u000a        in the use of hydro-carbons and other low boiling point propellants for\u000d\u000a        consumer aerosols.

A more practical approach for the total replacement of VOCs\u000d\u000a        and greenhouse gases has been found to be compressed gas (e.g. air or\u000d\u000a        nitrogen) propellants.\u000d\u000a      However, aerosols using compressed gas propellant with an outlet valve\u000d\u000a        derived from conventional designs typically have poor spray\u000d\u000a        characteristics (large droplet size) and a noticeable deterioration in\u000d\u000a        performance during the life of the can as the product is used.\u000d\u000a      Nasr demonstrates that atomisation can be improved by gas bubbles and\u000d\u000a        turbulence inside the atomiser insert of the actuator, ensuring that\u000d\u000a        compressed gas aerosols fitted with the eco-valve provided consistent\u000d\u000a        pressure through life of the can and delivered the fine droplet spray\u000d\u000a        qualities required by consumers.\u000d\u000a      The main beneficiaries of the new development are global consumer\u000d\u000a        goods companies who manufacture products such deodorants (the biggest\u000d\u000a        single annual user of aerosol technology); hairsprays; air fresheners;\u000d\u000a        polish; insecticide; disinfectant; shaving foam; food products (such as\u000d\u000a        whipped cream, olive oil and cooking oil) and pharmaceutical application\u000d\u000a        such as medical inhalers, and their customers.\u000d\u000a      Nasr worked in partnership with multi-national manufacturers involved\u000d\u000a        in the production and use of aerosols to collaborate on and take up the\u000d\u000a        development.

The interaction of the bubbly flow with the valve insert\u000d\u000a        causes a flow attachment and reattachment phenomenon, generating a\u000d\u000a        highly energised and turbulent state.\u000d\u000a      The technique acts to reduce the subsequent droplet size of the\u000d\u000a        product when dispensed from the valve, generating superior spray\u000d\u000a        characteristics.\u000d\u000a      In addition, by controlling the ratio of liquid to gas injected (via\u000d\u000a        selecting the correct orifice sizes in the correct ratio), enables\u000d\u000a        maintenance of consistent spray performance throughout the life of the\u000d\u000a        can.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24673","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research of the Humphreys' group has had impact on three companies: Forge\u000a        Europa Ltd, AIXTRON Ltd and Plessey Semiconductors Ltd.\u000a    The impact on Forge Europa has been from the Humphreys' group\u000a      research on LED reliability, &amp; it was highlighted in the EPSRC Annual\u000a      Report 2010-2011 [1] under the heading \"Economic Success for Gallium\u000a      Nitride LEDs\": \"Professor Sir Colin Humphreys and his team at Cambridge\u000a      University... have delivered positive outcomes for businesses in the\u000a      lighting industry...

The QWs emit blue light &amp; a\u000a      covering phosphor converts this to white. Bright emission is obtained for\u000a      dislocation densities as high as 109 cm-2, while for\u000a      all other light-emitting semiconductors the dislocation density has to be\u000a      less than 103 cm-2, or dislocations, as\u000a      non-radiative recombination centres, quench light emission. It was thought\u000a      that nm-sized In-rich clusters in the QWs localized the carriers\u000a      (electrons &amp; holes) &amp; prevented them from diffusing to the\u000a      dislocations. Such clusters, observed in electron microscopy, were shown\u000a      by Humphreys' group to be an artefact of electron-beam damage [1],\u000a      changing the accepted understanding of why GaN LEDs are so efficient with\u000a      high dislocation densities, &amp; underpinning the group's subsequent work\u000a      on high-efficiency GaN LEDs.\u000a    In collaboration with Manchester University (performing optical studies),\u000a      Humphreys' group showed that carriers in the InGaN quantum wells are\u000a      localized within a few nanometres, &amp; suggested a localization\u000a      mechanism [2]: monolayer-height QW thickness fluctuations, which the group\u000a      observed in high-resolution electron microscopy in device structures grown\u000a      in DMSM.\u000a    Although the efficiency of GaN LEDs is not highly sensitive to the\u000a      dislocation density, the efficiency is reduced if the dislocation density\u000a      is very high. To study this, Humphreys' group invented a novel, fast\u000a      method for assessing dislocation densities in GaN [3], followed by a\u000a      breakthrough [4] on how to reduce the dislocation density of GaN grown on\u000a      sapphire, using porous silicon nitride interlayers. The group was able to\u000a      transfer this method to growth of GaN LEDs on 6-inch Si substrates &#8212; very\u000a      difficult, compared to growth on smaller-diameter sapphire or SiC\u000a      substrates. The large (54%) difference in the thermal expansion\u000a      coefficients of GaN &amp; Si leads to wafer bowing on cooling from the\u000a      growth temperature (~1000&#176;C); the GaN is in tension &amp; cracks.\u000a      Humphreys' group inserted four graded AlGaN layers, carefully tailored so\u000a      that their compressive stress compensates the tensile stress upon cooling,\u000a      crucially ending with a flat, crack-free LED. The large (17%) lattice\u000a      mismatch between GaN &amp; Si would result in an unacceptably high\u000a      dislocation density, &amp; Humphreys' group solved this problem using a\u000a      sub-monolayer SiN mask with natural holes; epitaxial lateral overgrowth\u000a      from these reduces the dislocation density by two orders of magnitude.\u000a    To protect know-how, only a little (eg [5] &amp; a patent pending [6])\u000a      has so far been published on the commercially important processing to\u000a      achieve GaN LED growth on 6-inch Si.\u000a    Humphreys' group members taking up specialist roles drawing on their\u000a        research:\u000a      Tim Smeeton (PhD student), 2001-4.

It wasn't until\u000a      2003, when in discussion with Melvin Vinton, it was decided to\u000a      form a company, InotecAMD Ltd [i] (references in Section 5), to\u000a      initially design an oxygen-distribution system, funded by a Smart Award.\u000a      In 2005, the Dept of Materials Science &amp; Metallurgy at UCAM funded a\u000a      one-year research project (&#163;100k) to develop the oxygen-generation system.\u000a      This device was a success and was patented by the University in 2005 and,\u000a      subsequently, licensed to InotecAMD Ltd on 27 July 2009, with an\u000a      effective date of 1 January 2008. From 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2013,\u000a      [text removed for publication]\u000a    This allowed the oxygen-generation system to be industrialized and the\u000a      oxygen-distribution system to be perfected.\u000a    Natrox&#8482; is the first device that can successfully\u000a        deliver oxygen, almost indefinitely if the batteries are kept recharged,\u000a        to patients without interfering with their lifestyle.\u000a    Over 200 Natrox&#8482; units have been made with many being used for random\u000a        controlled trials at three hospitals in Prague. The remainder have\u000a      been used for trials in the UK and sent to agents\/distributors in the UK,\u000a      USA, France, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey and Dubai.\u000a\u000aFigure 2. The oxygen generator and circular pad in close-up (on the left), and positioned on the leg of a mannequin (right). The oxygen is evenly distributed over the wound by the pad and the large spaces in the pad allow the escape of exudate.\u000a\u000a    Health impacts\u000a    To check the viability of the Natrox&#8482; device, trials were\u000a      performed at the end of 2009 at a Tissue Viability Clinic in Eastbourne,\u000a      which dramatically showed the efficacy of such a device with 10 patients\u000a      who had been referred to the clinic by the NHS as not treatable; 8 showed\u000a      considerable improvement after six weeks treatment [iv]. A bonus not\u000a      originally considered was that the pain, experienced by the patients, also\u000a      decreased considerably when oxygen was fed to their wounds [iv]. Further\u000a        successful trials have been carried out at Doncaster Royal Infirmary\u000a      on hard-to-heal wounds as the result of surgery. An evaluation of oxygen\u000a      therapy was undertaken on a range of complex surgical wounds, which\u000a      included post-mastectomy wounds which had dehisced (ie opened) following\u000a      surgery. It was found that, after about six weeks treatment with oxygen,\u000a      the wounds improved dramatically and conventional treatment could then be\u000a      applied to procure a complete recovery. It was concluded that this therapy\u000a      was successful, both in promoting healing and improving the quality of\u000a      life in a group of anxious patients [v]. In early 2012, the Natrox&#8482;\u000a      system was subjected to a safety study at the FNKV Hospital in Prague on\u000a      ten patients with non-healing leg ulcers and all patients showed\u000a      considerable shrinkage of their ulcers.\u000a    In June 2012, InotecAMD Ltd received a CE mark\u000a        for the oxygen-delivery system giving all the regulatory approvals for\u000a        sales in the EU. In July 2012, the US FDA awarded the 510(k) approval\u000a        for the Natrox&#8482; system meaning that Natrox&#8482;\u000a        can be sold in the US [vi].\u000a    At present, a random controlled trial is being performed in Prague on ~60\u000a      patients so that the treatment can be sold to the NHS. In November 2013,\u000a      Doncaster &amp; Bassetlaw hospitals will embark on a 12-month trial\u000a      studying non-healing surgical wounds and breast reconstruction [v].\u000a    Overall, about 80 patients have been successfully treated, ie healed,\u000a        with a considerable decrease in their suffering, coupled with an\u000a        increase in their general wellbeing.\u000a    Impacts on public policy and services\u000a    About 2 million patients in the European Union suffer from non-healing\u000a      ulcers, and the annual cost of treating these is estimated to be 10\u000a      billion Euros. The clinical trials provide hard evidence that the use of Natrox&#8482;\u000a      would decrease the number of patients and shorten treatment times. Natrox&#8482;\u000a      has opened up possibilities for more cost-effective healthcare, with\u000a      better outcomes. Secondly, the rationale for the trials at Doncaster &amp;\u000a      Bassetlaw hospitals is to study oxygen as an anti-microbial treatment, as\u000a      many patients have increased resistance to antibiotics [v]. The use of\u000a      oxygen instead of antibiotics for treating infected wounds would again\u000a      improve both outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of the service.\u000a    Economic impacts\u000a    As well as cost savings to national budgets, the manufacture and supply\u000a      of Natrox&#8482; devices will generate employment and income for the UK.\u000a      In 2013, the company employed a part-time CEO, a full-time Chief Technical\u000a      Officer and three other part-time staff. In addition, much of the\u000a      equipment, circuitry, oxygen-distribution pad and units are manufactured,\u000a      under subcontract, in the UK. The random controlled trial is being\u000a      organized by UK-based SME Wound Market Consulting\u000a      (www.woundmarketconsulting.com).

In particular, Nafion membranes,\u000a      which are proton conductors under humid conditions, were used to create\u000a      hydrogen sensors [1] and membranes for electrowinning cells [2,3].\u000a      Furthermore, in work initiated in 1993, hydrophobic porous membranes were\u000a      used to create fine bubbles (sparging) in electrowinning cells\u000a      [2,3]. Critical lessons (on the benefits of smaller gas bubbles and how\u000a      they can be achieved) from this hydrometallurgy work were directly\u000a      applicable in developing the Natrox&#8482; device for oxygen generation.\u000a    An earlier oxygen-generating device had been developed by others in the\u000a      US, but this device had several disadvantages, including: failure of the\u000a      cell due to drying out of the electrolyte; formation of hydrogen peroxide\u000a      which is a known carcinogen; and, lastly, oxygen was fed by a\u000a      small-diameter tube (cannula) to the wound (a method not favoured\u000a      by UK clinicians).\u000a\u000aFigure 1. Diagram of Natrox&#8482; oxygen generator showing, on the right, the electrochemical cell that produces the oxygen from water in the membrane and the oxidation catalyst, on the left, where the hydrogen is reacted with oxygen from the air, to produce water that is returned to the membrane.\u000a\u000a\u0009  Building upon previous research, described in the first paragraph, Derek\u000a        Fray (Professor of Materials Chemistry 2001-2007, Director of\u000a        Research and Emeritus Professor of Materials Chemistry 2007-)\u000a      concluded that it was feasible to create a device that overcame all of\u000a      these problems. Together with Dr Vega Kotzeva, (Post Doctoral\u000a      Research Associate 2005-2006), a small cell was built, based on a design\u000a      that had been previously used for a hydrogen sensor [1], which used a Nafion\u000a      membrane surrounded by a small reservoir of water.\u000a    This successfully demonstrated that, by applying a small voltage (1.5 V)\u000a      across the membrane, a flow of oxygen was created which would satisfy the\u000a      needs of an average ulcer (15 ml\/h) with a weekly consumption of water of\u000a      1 ml. It was thought desirable to oxidize the hydrogen (a by-product of\u000a      the electrolysis process) by placing a catalyst layer a short distance\u000a      from the cathode, allowing the hydrogen to react with air to form water\u000a      which then returns to the membrane [4,5]. Rather surprisingly, it was\u000a      found that with a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes it\u000a      was possible to operate the device indefinitely, producing humidified\u000a      oxygen without the need for a water reservoir, provided the batteries were\u000a      kept charged. A diagram of the cell is shown in Figure 1. The distribution\u000a      pad for the oxygen was, again, created using the discoveries in the\u000a      hydrometallurgical studies of sparging. This previous research\u000a      showed that, by applying a modest gas pressure, a porous hydrophobic\u000a      membrane allowed the creation of a uniform supply of bubbles [2,3]. This\u000a      is ideal for supply of oxygen to a wound but, in order for the exudate to\u000a      escape, it is necessary to also have very much larger holes in the\u000a      membrane. The end result is a pad that allows oxygen bubbles to be created\u000a      at the wound and the exudate successfully removed (Figure 2 [6]).\u000a      Furthermore, unlike the cannula approach, the hydrophobic pad does not\u000a      stick to the wound which makes the removal of the pad from the wound easy\u000a      and painless. The combination of the oxygen generator and oxygen-delivery\u000a      system has been trademarked as Natrox&#8482;.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24686","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Despite the vast amount of empirical data available, the underpinning\u000d\u000a      fundamental research (Section 2) on atomic mechanisms was essential for\u000d\u000a      the design of steel compositions and heat treatments to achieve the\u000d\u000a      desired nanostructure without other undesirable reactions, as a function\u000d\u000a      of many variables.

Excess carbon then partitions into the\u000d\u000a      austenite. The formation of this classical metallurgical structure, bainite,\u000d\u000a      has for many decades been difficult to interpret, because the atoms\u000d\u000a      involved have very limited mobility during the phase change. Harry\u000d\u000a        Bhadeshia (on the academic staff of the Dept of Materials Science\u000d\u000a        &amp; Metallurgy (DMSM) at the University of Cambridge (UCAM)\u000d\u000a        1981 to date, and currently Tata Steel Professor) is noted\u000d\u000a      for example as the inventor of the ultra-tough steel used for the rails in\u000d\u000a      the Channel Tunnel. Supported by grants from a series of sponsors (Section\u000d\u000a      3), his systematic work has revealed the mechanisms and quantitatively\u000d\u000a      characterized bainite formation.\u000d\u000a    Bhadeshia pioneered the concept that there is no fundamental lower limit\u000d\u000a      to the temperature at which bainite can be produced, and predicted\u000d\u000a      refinement of its structure and improvement of properties by heat\u000d\u000a      treatment at lower temperature. Bhadeshia and FG Caballero (PDRA\u000d\u000a      in DMSM, July 1997 to July 1999) worked with the Ministry of Defence (MOD)\u000d\u000a      on designing a steel for gun-barrels, and discovered a bainitic steel that\u000d\u000a      had very desirable ballistic and mechanical properties (strength 2500 MPa;\u000d\u000a      toughness 40 MPa m1\/2). A patent was filed on this new\u000d\u000a      composition and its manufacture [1], and a later paper [2] is highly\u000d\u000a      cited.\u000d\u000a    The new steel required heat treatment at 200&#176;C for 10 days, making it\u000d\u000a      difficult to manufacture. Bhadeshia and C Garcia-Mateo (PDRA in\u000d\u000a      DMSM, July 2000 to June 2003), funded by the EPSRC and MOD, confirmed the\u000d\u000a      high strength obtainable at low temperature [3] and, crucially, showed how\u000d\u000a      the bainite transformation could be accelerated [4]. Aiming at designing a\u000d\u000a      steel for armour rather than gun-barrels, and using thermodynamic and\u000d\u000a      kinetic modelling, alloys were identified and selected variants were made\u000d\u000a      and tested. By the end, a Super Bainite steel with a\u000d\u000a      transformation temperature of 200&#176;C (a lowish temperature more associated\u000d\u000a      with cooking pizza than with heat-treating steel!) that transformed in\u000d\u000a        hours and not days, had been identified. The resulting material,\u000d\u000a      with a strength in excess of 2500 MPa, has the highest density of\u000d\u000a      interfaces ever reported from a phase change alone; the low-temperature\u000d\u000a      treatment had created the world's first bulk nanostructured metal.\u000d\u000a      In this Super Bainite, the ferritic crystals are only 20-40 nm\u000d\u000a      thick.\u000d\u000a    From 2004, Bhadeshia worked with Dr Peter Brown from DSTL,\u000d\u000a      as a result of which Corus (now Tata Steel) was contracted\u000d\u000a      by DSTL to make tonnage quantities for large-scale evaluation\u000d\u000a      (Fig. 1).

His polymer-science research\u000a      spanned from flexible polymers (e.g. polyethylene) through to the most\u000a      rigid liquid-crystalline polymers. He perceived CNTs as the ultimate rigid\u000a      polymer molecule, fuelling new ideas for their processing into useful\u000a      materials such as fibres. Windle's group undertook some of the first work\u000a      on CNT composites, studying their liquid suspensions, and measuring the\u000a      influence of entanglements on properties. Work with Shaffer (PDRA,\u000a      left 2006, now Professor at Imperial) led to several research papers, e.g.\u000a      [1], and later the first report of liquid crystallinity in CNT suspensions\u000a      [2].\u000a    Research into CNT synthesis led to a patent set which was licensed to Thomas\u000a        Swan &amp; Co Ltd, a specialist chemical manufacturer of Consett, Co\u000a      Durham, which based a new business on it. Specifically, the problem of\u000a      catalyst particle-size control was solved by forming from a precursor\u000a      deposited on a magnesium-oxide substrate, which was removed by dissolution\u000a      after CNT growth. The products now on sale (see Section 4a) consist of highly characterized\u000a      single-wall CNTs.\u000a\u0009  Windle's subsequent research explored much higher\u000a      synthesis temperatures, up to 1300&#176;C, and moved from substrate to floating\u000a      catalyst (gaseous suspension) methods. The CNTs form a smoke; their\u000a      entanglement means the smoke is elastic and can be continuously withdrawn\u000a      from the reactor as a fibre, as fast as it is produced. Work with two\u000a      PDRAs, Ian Kinloch (2002-06, now Professor at Manchester) and Ya-Li\u000a        Li (2001-04), led to a high-profile publication [3] and to a patent,\u000a      now granted in the US and Korea, with Europe and Japan pending. The\u000a      invention is essentially an aerogel version of the (liquid) gel-drawing\u000a      process for making the polyethylene high-tech fibre marketed by DSM as Dyneema.\u000a    Process development 2004 to 2008, funded by an EPSRC grant (EP\/E04218X\/1,\u000a      &#163;890,000, with Windle as PI), included fibre condensation, external\u000a      reeling, control of injection and process modelling using advanced CFD\u000a      packages, the latter work in collaboration with UCAM's Dept of Chemical\u000a      Engineering [4]. This work led to two supporting patents. The grant also\u000a      involved collaboration with Vicki Stone (Napier University, now\u000a      Professor of Toxicology and Director of Nano-Safety Research Group, School\u000a      of Life Sciences, Heriot-Watt University). Thus health issues with the\u000a      production of CNT materials were addressed as the research developed, not\u000a      as an afterthought. A collaboration with US Army Natick Soldier\u000a        Research Development and Engineering Center examined the\u000a      relationship between structure and strength [5]: in short gauge lengths,\u000a      the fibre had exceptional strength and stiffness [6], clearly exceeding\u000a      those of conventional high-performance fibres. One sample measured is\u000a      possibly the strongest fibre ever seen [6].\u000a    Since 2008, the research has continued unabated, particularly in process\u000a      control and in understanding mechanical properties, with a simple model\u000a      introduced for predicting strength. Unlike conventional carbon fibre, the\u000a      CNT fibre is exceptionally tough and weavable, largely because it is\u000a      yarn-like, illustrated particularly by the fibre's ability to take knots\u000a      without reduction in strength (Fig. 1). A further breakthrough (2011) by\u000a      Windle's group has been the creation of fibres containing only single-wall\u000a      CNTs with chiralities which lead to metallic rather than semiconducting\u000a      behaviour [7]. This advance stems from recognition that small amounts of\u000a      sulfur added to the process to promote CNT detachment from the floating\u000a      catalyst particles are also effective in limiting the growth of these\u000a      particles by collision, so they can be kept to sizes of order 1 nm until\u000a      the carbon necessary for CNT growth becomes available. The reason for the\u000a      very useful selectivity for tubes of metallic chirality is not yet\u000a      completely understood and work in collaboration with the global modelling\u000a      community is addressing this key issue. Work towards composites has shown\u000a      that when the fibres are embedded in a resin matrix, the resin infiltrates\u000a      the fibre, giving excellent keying and thus interfacial shear strength on\u000a      curing.\u000a    \u000aFigure 1. A tight knot in the tough CNT fibre. The knot does not fail prematurely under tension.\u000a\u000a    The major commercial investment now occurring reflects the vision that\u000a        CNT fibre of this kind might replace carbon fibre in the structural\u000a        domain, and replace copper for electrical conductors, while being less\u000a        expensive on both counts.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24700","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The extensive research which led to the demonstration of `bio-factory on\u000a      a chip' functionality\u000a      allowed Bangor to acquire a deep appreciation of the capabilities of laser\u000a      micromachining.

UK-LMC was set up in 2005 to run financially independently from\u000a      the university through\u000a      the Bangor-created company Laser Micromachining Ltd (LML).

This facility enabled a step change in micro-fabrication\u000a      whereby complex multi-layered\u000a      electrode structures could be used to advance research on the\u000a      electro-kinetic manipulation\u000a      of biological cells. Early demonstrations of the efficacy of the\u000a      technology were reported in [P1].\u000a      Earlier research activity had relied on photolithographically-produced\u000a      microelectrodes for studying\u000a      di-electrophoresis [P2]. However, due to the combination of materials and\u000a      the need for sub 10&#181;m\u000a      electrodes within 3-dimensional polymer fluidic channels,\u000a      bio-factory-on-a-chip fabrication was not\u000a      possible with photolithography.\u000a    In developing the biofactory technology, the S8000 excimer laser system\u000a      was used extensively\u000a      allowing a very broad understanding and expertise in laser micromachining\u000a      to be gained at Bangor.\u000a      The final biofactory demonstrator device consisted of over 6000\u000a      microelectrodes configured in 9\u000a      independent distinct processing regions over a 75mm x 50mm area [G1].\u000a      Within each region every\u000a      fourth electrode was connected together to allow continuous travelling\u000a      electric fields to be created\u000a      for different forms of particle manipulation. This device used laser\u000a      micromachining to directly\u000a      pattern 5&#181;m wide microelectrodes from 100nm gold films deposited on glass.\u000a      Additionally, the\u000a      interconnected nature of the electrodes required up to 6 layers of\u000a      construction with busbars and\u000a      layer interconnection through via holes in polymer insulating layers.\u000a      Device reliability was achieved\u000a      by developing laser methods for contouring the edge of via holes to\u000a      improve metallisation. A\u000a      number of developed machining processes were used for this including\u000a      grayscale mask projection.\u000a      Grayscale machining was extended to produce microfluidic manifold systems\u000a      which allowed the\u000a      smooth distribution of fluids between multiple channels within\u000a      lab-on-a-chip devices [P3].\u000a      Additionally, the ability to machine difficult to etch materials with 3D\u000a      profiles was used to produce\u000a      micropumps with contoured membranes. The expertise in excimer laser\u000a      micromachining\u000a      developed between 1996 and 2002 has been used to support subsequent\u000a      microfabrication\u000a      activities including the development of polymer electronic devices by\u000a      direct machining or\u000a      photobleaching. In 2002 Bangor purchased an Exitech M2000F femtosecond\u000a      laser micromachining\u000a      workstation [G2], again, the first such tool in a UK university.\u000a      Femto-second laser machining has\u000a      also been used within a RCUK Basic Technology Programme in the development\u000a      of optical\u000a      biochips (2003-2007) where the ability to machine with no heat damage or\u000a      debris has been used to\u000a      machine active light emitting semiconductors to produce wafers containing\u000a      microfluidic channels\u000a      with integrated, custom shaped, light sources. The combined excimer and\u000a      femtosecond laser\u000a      micromachining capability enables the manufacture of biochips where\u000a      femtosecond machining is\u000a      used to cut composite materials and adhesives to form microfluidic\u000a      features and the excimer laser\u000a      has been used to pattern transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes\u000a      [P4]\u000a    Key contributing researchers with their positions and time in Bangor are\u000a      summarised here :\u000a      Lecturer\/Reader\/Professor R.

The aeroengine research was initiated in 1999 when JIF\/EPSRC\u000a      funding enabled the\u000a      establishment of the Stress and Damage Characterisation Unit, now an\u000a      internationally recognised\u000a      centre of excellence for residual stress characterisation. In 2007, the\u000a      Henry Moseley X-ray Imaging\u000a      Facility was set up through an EPSRC grant; the Facility contains 7 X-ray\u000a      scanners, the widest\u000a      range of laboratory CT systems in the UK. Research into materials for use\u000a      in jet engines includes:\u000a    \u000a      Working with samples joined using industrial-scale inertia welding\u000a        equipment at\u000a        Manufacturing Technology Inc (MTI) in the USA and at Rolls-Royce, we\u000a        were able to\u000a        characterise the steep microstructural gradients and residual stresses\u000a        introduced by a new\u000a        process, namely inertia rotational welding, developed specifically to\u000a        join the next generation\u000a        of high f067' containing RR1000 Ni superalloy discs for jet engines.\u000a        Using the ISIS neutron\u000a        source we were able to carry across optimised treatments from small\u000a        prototype tests to a\u000a        full scale disc assembly [1, 6]. A key finding was that the new high\u000a        f067' containing alloys\u000a        generate larger residual stresses and require higher post-weld heat\u000a        treatments than\u000a        conventional alloys.\u000a      Linear friction welding has been proposed as a method for joining\u000a        single crystal blades to\u000a        discs for jet engines. We were the first to measure the residual\u000a        stresses and effects of\u000a        crystal orientation on weldability and microstructural evolution [2].\u000a      We were able to develop novel high resolution sub-surface mapping of\u000a        residual stress by\u000a        synchrotron diffraction to determine the residual stresses introduced by\u000a        laser peening in\u000a        both plates and jet engine fan blade roots [3]. We were able to show\u000a        how, unlike\u000a        conventional shot peening, laser peening produces stresses deep into the\u000a        blade roots that\u000a        are resistant to fretting in-service.\u000a      Our X-ray facility is specially designed for in situ imaging of\u000a        engineering materials and\u000a        components across a wide range of environments, timescales and length\u000a        scales [5].

It is thus a highly attractive material for\u000d\u000a      manufacturing components where weight saving is critical for improved fuel\u000d\u000a      efficiency and reduced emissions or better performance. However,\u000d\u000a      traditional magnesium alloys suffer from three critical shortcomings; poor\u000d\u000a      strength, poor corrosion resistance, and limited elevated temperature\u000d\u000a      capability. Novel alloys and protection strategies, only possible as a\u000d\u000a      result of research at Manchester, have produced a step change improvement\u000d\u000a      in each of these areas and as a result have allowed the weight-saving\u000d\u000a      benefits of magnesium to be exploited in new demanding applications in\u000d\u000a      aerospace, automotive, and military applications that were previously\u000d\u000a      impossible [A].\u000d\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000d\u000a      The research described in section 2 has led to a new family of high\u000d\u000a      performance magnesium which have the greatest strength and best corrosion\u000d\u000a      performance of any commercial magnesium alloy, representing a step-change\u000d\u000a      improvement over traditional magnesium alloys. Critical to the performance\u000d\u000a      of the alloys is control of the structure on the micro-scale\u000d\u000a      (microstructure). Research at Manchester has elucidated the complex\u000d\u000a      relationships between the microstructure and properties [1,4,6].\u000d\u000a      Understanding the effect of each alloying addition and interaction with\u000d\u000a      processing conditions enabled researchers at Manchester to design the new\u000d\u000a      alloys to obtain exceptional properties [1,3,6]. Further Manchester\u000d\u000a      research has led to the development of new environmentally friendly\u000d\u000a      coatings enabling these alloys to be protected from corrosion in\u000d\u000a      aggressive environments such as salt water [2,5]. Finally, recent\u000d\u000a      Manchester work to understand the biocompatibility of these alloys was\u000d\u000a      critical in the development of Synermag, the first commercial magnesium\u000d\u000a      product designed for bioresorbable implants.\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000d\u000a      Impact on Materials Manufacturers\u000d\u000a      The impact described is the result of a 20-year collaboration with ME.\u000d\u000a      This has led to the development to a series of commercial magnesium alloys\u000d\u000a      including WE43B, WE54A, Elektron-21, Elektron-675, and Elektron-43. ME is\u000d\u000a      part of the Luxfer Group, a UK based global materials technology company.\u000d\u000a      They are acknowledged world leaders in magnesium alloy development, having\u000d\u000a      designed over 80% of the new magnesium alloys developed in the last 30\u000d\u000a      years. These alloys contribute ~$20m per annum in revenue to ME, with 61%\u000d\u000a      coming from export markets (corroborating source [B]).The exceptional\u000d\u000a      properties of the new alloys has enabled ME to develop new products for\u000d\u000a      the aerospace, automotive and medical markets [B]. This includes Synermag,\u000d\u000a      the first commercial bioresorbable magnesium alloy product, now being\u000d\u000a      produced at a new (2012) $2m dedicated production facility in the UK [B].\u000d\u000a    Impact on Aerospace and Automotive\u000d\u000a      The new alloys and associated protection systems have found extensive\u000d\u000a      application in helicopter and fixed wing military aircraft that include\u000d\u000a      the Westland Lynx, McDonnell Douglas MD500, F22 Raptor, Apache Mark-3\u000d\u000a      attack helicopter and the F35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The 35% mass\u000d\u000a      reduction enabled by using these alloys in place of aluminium is critical\u000d\u000a      to meet performance and range targets. These aircraft are now being\u000d\u000a      produced in large numbers, for example 3100 JSF aircraft are expected in\u000d\u000a      service by 2035. WE43B and Elektron-21 are also undergoing final FAA\u000d\u000a      certification for civil aerospace with applications in structural\u000d\u000a      components targeted by Airbus and Boeing due to the potential for weight\u000d\u000a      saving and emissions reduction. Aerospace industry calculations have\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that a 10% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions will\u000d\u000a      be obtained through increased used of high performance magnesium alloys in\u000d\u000a      a typical large passenger aircraft [C].\u000d\u000a    Alloys Elektron-21 and WE43B have also found use in high performance\u000d\u000a      wheels, gearboxes and engine castings for the motorsport industry by\u000d\u000a      companies including Cosworth and Maclaren Mercedes, since they provide the\u000d\u000a      ultimate in strength to weight performance at elevated temperature. An\u000d\u000a      improvement in strength\/weight ratio of between 20-25% is obtainable using\u000d\u000a      these magnesium alloys in place of traditional aluminium solutions, saving\u000d\u000a      around 10 kg from the vehicle mass, which translates to improved\u000d\u000a      acceleration and braking performance [D].\u000d\u000a    Biomedical Applications\u000d\u000a    Recent (2007-present) research at Manchester revealed that in addition to\u000d\u000a    their suitability for structural applications, the new family of alloys also\u000d\u000a    have attractive properties for biomedical application as safe bioresorbable\u000d\u000a    materials with excellent compatibility with bone. This research has led to a\u000d\u000a    Magnesium Elektron patenting (2011) a new alloy (Synermag) for biomedical\u000d\u000a    applications in resorbable implants. This alloy has been used to produce\u000d\u000a    bioresorbable stents, wire, and screws in collaboration with a medical\u000d\u000a    devices manufacturer (commercially confidential). Successful animal trials\u000d\u000a    have been conducted and these products are currently undergoing\u000d\u000a    certification for surgical use in humans.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at Manchester has led to the development of a new class of high\u000d\u000a      performance magnesium alloys based on the addition of rare-earth alloying\u000d\u000a      elements.

Consequently, new materials can only be applied once an\u000d      appropriate joining technique has been developed. A step forward for new\u000d      disk materials such as powder-processed nickel base superalloys is to\u000d      transfer from fusion to solid state welding techniques, such as inertia\u000d      and linear friction welding.\u000d    Pathways to Impact\u000d    The research carried out in Manchester contributed to developing inertia\u000d      and linear friction welding parameters in order to join powder processed\u000d      nickel-base superalloys, high strength dissimilar steels and an advanced\u000d      Titanium alloy. Detailed microstructure and residual stress analysis\u000d      provided a new understanding of the welding processes, which in return\u000d      provided guidance in developing parameters with researchers directly\u000d      involved in the parameter development by participating in welding trials\u000d      carried out in the USA. The fundamental research upon inertia welding was\u000d      funded originally by the EPSRC (1999-2002, &#163;145k). Translation of this\u000d      research for application by Rolls-Royce in aeroengines has been provided\u000d      though a number of projects of over the period 2002-2011 with a value\u000d      &#163;750k, funded from a number of different sources that include the DTI, TSB\u000d      and Rolls-Royce.\u000d    Reach and Significance\u000d    Many friction welding combinations that were studied are now employed in\u000d      modern aeroengines developed by Rolls-Royce. For instance, inertia\u000d      friction welding of nickel base superalloys has been used in the Trent\u000d      900, which powers the A380. The number of friction welds has further\u000d      increased in the Trent 1000 (entry into service in 2010) for the Boeing\u000d      787. The Trent XWB engine (maiden flight in 2013) that powers the A350\u000d      Airbus will again see the introduction of additional friction welds where\u000d      University of Manchester contributed by undertaking detailed\u000d      microstructural and residual stress analysis. The Trent XWB was\u000d      custom-designed for the A350, and the A350 with the XWB engines provide a\u000d      25% step-change in fuel efficiency compared to its current long-range\u000d      competitor [A]. More than 1,200 of these engines have so far been ordered\u000d      [B]. It was announced in April 2013 that the parent company of British\u000d      Airways, International Airlines Group had placed an order with Rolls-Royce\u000d      for more than &#163;1 bn for Trent XWB engines to power a fleet of 18 Airbus\u000d      A350-1000 aircraft, along with an option to buy engines for a further 18\u000d      [C].\u000d    The implementation of these friction welds allows Rolls-Royce to use new\u000d      high temperature materials (RR1000), as well as novel material\u000d      combinations. As a consequence, the engines can operate at a higher\u000d      temperature than previous engines with material that has about a 50 f0b0C\u000d      higher temperature capability than previous alloys. The result of this is\u000d      that Rolls-Royce has been able to develop new engines with improved fuel\u000d      efficiency. By enabling the operating temperature to be increased, there\u000d      are also subsequent benefits in terms of NOx and CO2\u000d      fuel emissions.\u000d    In addition, research has enabled blisk technology, which has delivered\u000d      up to 30% weight saving on critical rotating components. The capability to\u000d      join materials without the requirement for mechanical joints (such as\u000d      bolts) has also enabled the development of novel engine architectures.\u000d      This gives benefits in terms of SFC and has also enabled Rolls-Royce plc\u000d      to maintain market share as they are able to offer this technology to\u000d      their customers. All of these aspects are crucial for Rolls-Royce in order\u000d      to maintain competitive advantage and compete in the global market [D].\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Research at the University of Manchester has supported the development of\u000d      inertia and linear friction welding of high temperature materials for\u000d      aeroengine application.

Consequently the Flavia\u000d\u000a      single portion fresh beverage system has revolutionised the delivery of\u000d\u000a      refreshments in the office environment. It is a simple to use, convenient,\u000d\u000a      clean and reliable drinks system that has replaced the \"office coffee pot\"\u000d\u000a      worldwide.\u000d\u000a    Klix instant drinks\u000d\u000a    The Klix system is now used widely in public spaces such as at\u000d\u000a      colleges and in factories, delivering a range of branded drinks, both\u000d\u000a      reliably and with consistent quality. The research at the University of\u000d\u000a      Manchester upon the material used in the Klix cups has been of\u000d\u000a      major significance in the development of the system. Topics studied have\u000d\u000a      included polymer blends, rubber toughening, thermal conductivity and\u000d\u000a      recycling. A specific example of impact was in solving the problem of\u000d\u000a      environmental stress cracking (ESC) in the high-impact polystyrene (HIPS)\u000d\u000a      cups used in the Klix system &#8212; a potential safety hazard.\u000d\u000a      Polystyrene is susceptible to ESC in the presence of the fats in dairy\u000d\u000a      products. This was found to be a particular issue for the Klix\u000d\u000a      system with milky drinks such as drinking chocolate or white coffee. It\u000d\u000a      was demonstrated that the ESC problem resulted from the size and form of\u000d\u000a      the rubber particles in the grade of HIPS employed in the presence of\u000d\u000a      dairy products. The relatively small rubber particles in HIPS were\u000d\u000a      susceptible to damage during processing that reduced their effective size\u000d\u000a      further. It was found that the ESC problem could be overcome by specifying\u000d\u000a      a different grade of HIPS with larger rubber particles.\u000d\u000a    Significance\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research with the University of Manchester, that has led\u000d\u000a      to the development of the present Klix and Flavia drinks\u000d\u000a      systems has been a central and necessary component in the success of Mars\u000d\u000a      Drinks [A] through:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Better materials selection\u000d\u000a      Improved quality control\u000d\u000a      Improvements in packaging performance\u000d\u000a      Significant cost reduction\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    One particular problem that was encountered before the collaboration with\u000d\u000a      the University of Manchester was that the polymer-based components in Flavia\u000d\u000a      and Klix were poorly specified in terms of their structure and\u000d\u000a      properties, which meant that company was susceptible to changes in grades\u000d\u000a      of polymer by their suppliers.

International Standards and Policy development\u000d\u000a    Prof Crossley was the convenor of a CIGRE working group that used this\u000d\u000a      research to help prepare the technical brochure, effectively the\u000d\u000a      engineers' working practice guidance document, on the life-time management\u000d\u000a      of relay settings (CIGRE 539 GT B5.31). The approved version of this\u000d\u000a      document was published in June 2013 [C] and this guide is now influencing\u000d\u000a      global protection strategy and helping manufacturers deliver what\u000d\u000a      utilities require.\u000d\u000a    IEC61850 is the international standard for digital electrical\u000d\u000a      substations. The standard has developed over time and its extension to\u000d\u000a      protection and control was enabled by the implementation of time\u000d\u000a      synchronisation envisaged in this research. The IEC61859 standard was\u000d\u000a      updated to include the model for time synchronisation in July 2011 [D]\u000d\u000a    In the UK, National Grid have utilised the Manchester concepts to change\u000d\u000a      the National strategy on integrating the Control and Protection functions\u000d\u000a      within a substation (2002-2010) and to influence policy on the\u000d\u000a      Architecture for Substation Secondary System (AS3) (2010-date).\u000d\u000a      This policy defines the functional architecture for all new protection and\u000d\u000a      control systems used on the GB Transmission Network. National Grid's price\u000d\u000a      control agreement with OFGEM allows expenditure of &#163;334.3m over the RIIO\u000d\u000a      period 2013-21 [E].\u000d\u000a    2. Industry Uptake and Product Development\u000d\u000a    Most important transmission lines in the developed world are protected by\u000d\u000a      a combination of differential and distance protection, and the former\u000d\u000a      often uses GPS for time synchronisation. The major manufacturers have\u000d\u000a      developed products to meet the demand for such systems (e.g. Alstom MiCom\u000d\u000a      P594 GPS Synchronising unit; Toshiba Line Differential Protection GRL100;\u000d\u000a      GE L90 Line Current Differential System [F].\u000d\u000a    Electrical equipment installed on the Power System typically has a life\u000d\u000a      of 40-60 years. As a consequence the rate of uptake of new developments\u000d\u000a      can be relatively slow in terms of the number of units installed.\u000d\u000a      Nevertheless the global market in 2010 for GPS synchronised differential\u000d\u000a      feeder protection was worth more than &#163;400M per year, with the largest\u000d\u000a      user being China State Grid [G].\u000d\u000a    3. Use of IEC61850 in substations\u000d\u000a    Industry has further developed the concepts originated in the research to\u000d\u000a      produce products of higher added value through the implementation of\u000d\u000a      centralised time servers which are synchronised with GPS and distribute\u000d\u000a      the time signal across Ethernet networks [H].\u000d\u000a    National Grid has implemented GPS synchronisation within IEC61850 within\u000d\u000a      the AS3 development as part of their research and development\u000d\u000a      with the low carbon network fund provided by OFGEM. The project estimates\u000d\u000a      a potential saving of &#163;0.5m per year as the system is rolled out to\u000d\u000a      refurbished and newly built AS3 substations [I]. With the UK\u000d\u000a      representing circa 5% of the global market this would suggest a global\u000d\u000a      market for substation upgrading of &#163;10m per annum.\u000d\u000a    4. Mitigating Risk\u000d\u000a    At the end of the day the real value of all protection and control\u000d\u000a      systems is not in the value of systems implemented but in the costs\u000d\u000a      avoided by prevention of failure as shown by the $6bn economic loss in the\u000d\u000a      US blackout [A] and 700.000 people affected by the India blackout [B]. The\u000d\u000a      cost of the systems implemented can be viewed as the insurance premium and\u000d\u000a      their effectiveness is measured by the lack of interruption of power\u000d\u000a      supplies. In the developed world most consumers now have the expectation\u000d\u000a      of power supplies being permanently available as they have rarely or never\u000d\u000a      experience a power network failure.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Manchester research on differential protection, synchronised using the\u000d\u000a      global positioning system (GPS), has opened up a radically new approach to\u000d\u000a      protection and integrity of electrical transmission networks. The research\u000d\u000a      has led to updating of international technical guides and international\u000d\u000a      standards. In the UK, National Grid has implemented policies based on the\u000d\u000a      research, which will save about &#163;0.5m per annum in substation upgrade\u000d\u000a      costs.

While it is inherently difficult to estimate the value\u000a      of successful asset management, the avoided cost is orders of magnitude\u000a      larger than the cost of the service. The cost of the New York blackout in\u000a      2003 has been estimated as 11 deaths and $6Bn [A], and illustrates the\u000a      issue of simple local faults cascading to large societal costs [B].\u000a    Eurelectric has estimated the cost of power outages on industrial\u000a      customers at 1000 &#8364;\/kWh and residential customers at 1-5 &#8364;\/kWh. In\u000a      comparison the typical long distance transmission costs are 1-2 &#8364;\u000a      cents\/kWh [B].\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a    The main pathway to impact in power utility networks is via the spin-out\u000a      companies established as the result of this research. The first company to\u000a      emerge from the work described was IPEC in 1995, founded by the three\u000a      academics and two of their research students Lee Renforth and Colin Smith.\u000a      IPEC continued to work with the University and contribute to the research\u000a      described above. This led to the formation of a second company High\u000a      Voltage Partial Discharge Ltd (HVPD) in 2009. Smith and Renforth's\u000a      post-doc research directly contributed to the technology platforms of the\u000a      companies and they are the present Managing Directors of IPEC and HVPD\u000a      respectively.\u000a    In the aerospace sector we have worked directly with manufacturing\u000a      companies, receiving funding from Rolls-Royce and the EU, influencing\u000a      design policies and test methods directly, and gaining access to major\u000a      European manufacturers. Cotton has travelled extensively to manufacturing\u000a      centres in e.g. the USA, Germany, and India to ensure transfer of the\u000a      research globally. The work has already been exploited in manufacturing\u000a      companies as detailed below and is becoming formalised through SAE\u000a      aerospace information report AIR6127 which is a pre-cursor to a technical\u000a      standard on the use of high voltages in aerospace systems.\u000a    Reach and Significance of Impact\u000a    The significance of the impact from this research in utilities extends\u000a      beyond the two companies created (59 jobs and ~&#163;5m annual revenue at\u000a      present) and its major effect is on the asset management activities of\u000a      their clients, and subsequent operational savings.\u000a    IPEC and HVPD\u000a    IPEC, headquartered in Manchester, currently employs 11 staff and had a\u000a      turnover in 2012 of &#163;1m of which 40% is export business [C], the Managing\u000a      Director is Dr Colin Smith. HVPD has established itself as one of the\u000a      market leaders in the growing field of on-line partial PD test and\u000a      monitoring technology for high-voltage plant and cables with agents and\u000a      partners in more than 80 countries around the world. Based in Manchester,\u000a      in 2012 HVPD had a turnover of &#163;3.9m of which &#163;3m was exports. The company\u000a      currently employs 45 staff in the UK and 3 overseas [D]; its Managing\u000a      Director is Dr Lee Renforth. Throughout its history &#8212; both before the\u000a      spin-out from IPEC and since &#8212; HVPD has been active in supporting research\u000a      at the University of Manchester. This has led directly to a number of\u000a      important impacts for the company. The development of a patented\u000a      continuous condition monitoring system for HV motors operating in\u000a      hazardous conditions [E] and securing contracts based on the technologies\u000a      developed with global companies as shown by the recent award of a contract\u000a      valued at more than &#163;1m for condition monitoring technology to the oil\u000a      company Chevron [D].\u000a    In addition, research conducted with IPEC [2] led to the development of a\u000a      new software simulation package for optimising actuators used in MV\u000a      switchgear and autoreclosers.

Ester liquids have advantages over\u000d\u000a      mineral oils in that\u000d\u000a      they are biodegradable, both within soil and water, and they have a high\u000d\u000a      flash-point, which makes\u000d\u000a      them inherently safer, allowing a higher operating temperature.\u000d\u000a    The key research findings are as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      AC breakdown voltages of ester liquids under homogeneous fields were\u000d\u000a        proved to be similar to\u000d\u000a        those of mineral oil [1].\u000d\u000a      Key electrical characteristics, such as partial discharge inception,\u000d\u000a        propagation and discharge\u000d\u000a        patterns, under extreme inhomogeneous AC fields were determined and\u000d\u000a        recommendations made\u000d\u000a        for new and amended IEC standards related to electrical testing of\u000d\u000a        insulating liquids [5].\u000d\u000a      The breakdown voltage-gap distance equations for ester liquids were\u000d\u000a        formulated. This involved\u000d\u000a        the measurement of breakdown and pre-breakdown phenomena under standard\u000d\u000a        lightning\u000d\u000a        impulses, and established fast streamer-led breakdown theory as the main\u000d\u000a        cause of failure for\u000d\u000a        long liquid gaps [2] and complex insulation geometries involving\u000d\u000a        pressboard (solid insulation\u000d\u000a        barriers used in transformers) [6].\u000d\u000a      Empirical equations were developed that linked liquid viscosity,\u000d\u000a        temperature and vacuum level\u000d\u000a        with the processing time required for ester liquids to impregnate solid\u000d\u000a        insulating materials [4].\u000d\u000a      Dissolved gas analysis for condition assessment was demonstrated to be\u000d\u000a        appropriate for ester-filled\u000d\u000a        transformers, although the gas amounts and types were modified [3].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28186","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    In contemporary high-bypass aero engine designs (such as the Rolls-Royce\u000d\u000a      TrentTM engines) the fan forms the first compression stage and\u000d\u000a      can provide as much as 80% of total thrust. Fan blades are attached to a\u000d\u000a      disc by mechanical `dovetail' joints; these joints are subject to large\u000d\u000a      centripetal loads and high-frequency vibrations resulting in the root of\u000d\u000a      the blade experiencing a combination of high and low cycle fatigue\u000d\u000a      loading. Failure of a fan blade can be catastrophic to an engine, and can\u000d\u000a      endanger the aircraft if the resulting fragments are uncontained. The\u000d\u000a      initiation and growth of fatigue cracks in aerospace materials can be\u000d\u000a      halted by the introduction of compressive residual stresses. The\u000d\u000a      traditional and most commonly used method is to fire \"shot\" at the\u000d\u000a      surface. However, the depth of the compressive residual stress is only\u000d\u000a      around 250 &#181;m, and provides poor resistance to fretting fatigue. Following\u000d\u000a      two TrentTM 800 fan blade-off events in the early 2000's [B],\u000d\u000a      RR decided to explore laser shock peening (LSP) as an alternative\u000d\u000a      treatment, working in partnership with The Metal Improvement Company\u000d\u000a      (MIC). LSP involves the plastic deformation of surface layers through a\u000d\u000a      plasma created by a pulsed high power laser beam. Numerous LSP trials were\u000d\u000a      performed during the early 2000s to optimise the peening process but,\u000d\u000a      prior to our research, the mechanism and outcomes of compressive residual\u000d\u000a      stress generation were determined by RR to be insufficiently well\u000d\u000a      understood for production use.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000d\u000a    The research was carried out in close collaboration with Rolls-Royce and\u000d\u000a      MIC, using MIC treated fan blade root samples, thus providing a direct\u000d\u000a      route to implementation. As well as providing the academic basis to\u000d\u000a      underpin engineering practice, the Unit also established a Materials\u000d\u000a      Testing &amp; Analysis (MTA) Lab, able to test manufactured fan blade\u000d\u000a      components on a commercial basis for RR, so as to provide routine\u000d\u000a      documented assurance of the treatment. The MTA Lab is the only XRD\u000d\u000a      Residual Stress Measurement laboratory in the UK to be accredited to ISO\u000d\u000a      17025:2005, and residual stress measurements are performed to BS EN\u000d\u000a      15305_2008: Non-destructive testing. Test method for residual stress\u000d\u000a      analysis by X-ray diffraction [A]. Our neutron measurements conform to the\u000d\u000a      TWA20 VAMAS methodology. In addition, Prof Withers has given lectures to\u000d\u000a      MIC staff to explain the LSP process in detail, and at workshops organised\u000d\u000a      by MIC in the UK, Germany and Sweden, to explain the science, potential\u000d\u000a      benefits and possible pitfalls of LSP to over 100 companies in the\u000d\u000a      aerospace, nuclear and automotive sectors.\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000d\u000a    Wide chord fan blade technology is critical to RR's &#163;8.6bn pa, 1500\u000d\u000a      employee aero-engine business. Following high-profile adverse incidents\u000d\u000a      with the Trent&#8482; 800 engine, eliminating fan blade-off events, was critical\u000d\u000a      to re-establishing airline and consumer confidence. RR had already\u000d\u000a      identified LSP as a potential means of prolonging the life of fan blades,\u000d\u000a      prior to our collaboration, but the science to support this choice was\u000d\u000a      limited. By quantifying the efficacy of the LSP process in generating deep\u000d\u000a      compressive stresses, and demonstrating their stability in the harsh\u000d\u000a      service environment, the research gave the company the confidence to\u000d\u000a      transition LSP from a laboratory research and development activity, to a\u000d\u000a      reliable and production-qualified technology [C &amp; D]. As a result, RR\u000d\u000a      were able not only to solve the problem with the Trent&#8482; 800 engine, but\u000d\u000a      have since introduced the method more widely across its range of\u000d\u000a      aero-engines &#8212; extending LSP treatment to cover Trent&#8482; 500, 800, 1000 and\u000d\u000a      XWB engines in the REF period.\u000d\u000a    The role of the MTA Lab is critical to the on-going quality assurance of\u000d\u000a      fan blade production, confirming the integrity of the LSP-based\u000d\u000a      manufacturing process on a monthly schedule, assessing the likely\u000d\u000a      performance of newly designed components, and analysing component failures\u000d\u000a      &#8212; generating a turnover of around &#163;100,000 pa from RR alone. Its\u000d\u000a      world-class stress measurements performed on blade roots and disk posts\u000d\u000a      ensure the LSP process is applied consistently, and forms an integral part\u000d\u000a      of Rolls-Royce's QA procedure, contributing to Civil Aviation Authority\u000d\u000a      accreditation of Trent&#8482; aero-engines.\u000d\u000a    The Trent&#8482; XWB was custom-designed for the A350 Airbus and relies on\u000d\u000a      LSP-treated fan blades. More than 1,200 of these engines, with a total\u000d\u000a      value of over &#163;60 billion, have been ordered so far [E]. For example, it\u000d\u000a      was announced in September 2013 that Lufthansa had selected Rolls-Royce\u000d\u000a      Trent&#8482; XWB engines to power 25 Airbus A350-900 aircraft, an order worth\u000d\u000a      $1.5 billion. The airline also has options for a further 30 of the same\u000d\u000a      aircraft and engines &#8212; which would bring the total number to 55 aircraft\u000d\u000a      [F].\u000d\u000a    MIC are contracted by Rolls-Royce to carry out LSP of fan blades, and\u000d\u000a      have, as a result, established a dedicated facility employing 30 staff at\u000d\u000a      Earby, close to the RR Barnoldswick fan blade production facility.\u000d\u000a      Recently they won a contract to set up a similar facility within RR's\u000d\u000a      Singapore plant. At full capacity the Singapore site will produce over\u000d\u000a      6,000 blades per year.\u000d\u000a    Finally, the impact of this research has been recognised with the award\u000d\u000a      of the 2013 Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education for\u000d\u000a      developing \"New Imaging Techniques to Support Advanced Materials and\u000d\u000a      Manufacturing\". The work undertaken during the assessment period upon\u000d\u000a      laser peening in support of MIC and Rolls-Royce was featured as a major\u000d\u000a      case study in the application, highlighting the socio-economic impact of\u000d\u000a      the research.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Wide Chord Fan Blades provide a key competitive advantage for\u000d\u000a      Rolls-Royce's &#163;8.6bn aero-engine business employing 1500 staff. In\u000d\u000a      service, blades experience massive loads and high-frequency vibration,\u000d\u000a      creating the potential for failure. In response to blade-off events on the\u000d\u000a      Trent&#8482; 800 engine, Rolls-Royce (RR) urgently needed a means of inhibiting\u000d\u000a      fatigue crack growth, and selected laser shock peening (LSP).

Its\u000d\u000a      unique selling point, namely wideband radio-over-fibre distribution of\u000d\u000a      radio signals over a DAS\u000d\u000a      network, uses the underpinning research carried out in the FRIDAY and\u000d\u000a      subsequent RAIS projects.\u000d\u000a      The Zinwave DAS is a three-stage system for in-building cellular and\u000d\u000a      wireless services, constituting\u000d\u000a      a primary hub, secondary hubs, and remote units. It uses multimode or\u000d\u000a      single-mode fibre cable for\u000d\u000a      connectivity. The technology features true wideband capabilities allowing\u000d\u000a      simultaneous support for\u000d\u000a      any wireless standard including 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE, PMR\/LMR, DVB-H, TETRA,\u000d\u000a      Wi-Fi, WiMAX and\u000d\u000a      RFID. Full management control over this spectrum allows new services to be\u000d\u000a      added on-demand\u000d\u000a      without deploying additional system components. The technology can be\u000d\u000a      configured in a single,\u000d\u000a      dual star or mixed architecture to meet exact service needs. The advantage\u000d\u000a      to the customer is that\u000d\u000a      a single distribution system can distribute multiple wireless services\u000d\u000a      operating with different\u000d\u000a      protocols and at different frequencies.

Since the\u000d\u000a      1980s, wireless signals have been distributed within buildings by coaxial\u000d\u000a      cable, which is heavy, has\u000d\u000a      high losses (&gt; 245 dB\/km, LMR-400, 3 GHz) and is becoming increasingly\u000d\u000a      costly, making\u000d\u000a      installations uneconomical in many buildings. The transmission of wireless\u000d\u000a      signals over optical\u000d\u000a      fibre based on the work of UCL and other groups, described in [1], has\u000d\u000a      resulted in commercial\u000d\u000a      systems; these use either single-mode optical fibre (e.g. Andrew Inc.),\u000d\u000a      which requires the use of\u000d\u000a      expensive packaged single-mode optoelectronic devices, or multimode fibre\u000d\u000a      (e.g. LGC Wireless),\u000d\u000a      where the limited bandwidth makes it generally only possible to carry a\u000d\u000a      single wireless service on\u000d\u000a      each fibre. These approaches make the products high cost where multiple\u000d\u000a      wireless services are to\u000d\u000a      be carried, due to the expense of single-mode fibre components and complex\u000d\u000a      filtering schemes, or\u000d\u000a      of multiple multimode fibre links, respectively. There is thus a cost\u000d\u000a      barrier to providing widespread\u000d\u000a      wireless coverage in buildings.\u000d\u000a    The UCL group had carried out extensive research on wireless-over-fibre\u000d\u000a      links and the\u000d\u000a      underpinning microwave photonics technologies [1]. This included\u000d\u000a      EPSRC-funded work starting in\u000d\u000a      2000 on techniques for maximising the dynamic range of links, and for\u000d\u000a      reducing the noise and\u000d\u000a      distortion of links carrying multiple signals simultaneously. At Bristol\u000d\u000a      University, Dr. Penty had\u000d\u000a      shown that it was possible to increase the data transmission capacity of\u000d\u000a      multimode fibre through\u000d\u000a      the use of sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM). Professor Seeds, Professor of\u000d\u000a      Opto-Electronics at UCL,\u000d\u000a      realised that it might be possible to adapt this research to transmit\u000d\u000a      wireless signals over multimode\u000d\u000a      fibre without the need for down-conversion\/up-conversion as used in\u000d\u000a      commercial systems. In\u000d\u000a      addition to simplifying the system by removing the need for frequency\u000d\u000a      synchronisation this could\u000d\u000a      enable multiple wireless signals to be distributed over a single multimode\u000d\u000a      fibre with consequent\u000d\u000a      major cost reductions arising from the cheaper multimode fibre component\u000d\u000a      costs.\u000d\u000a    Professor Seeds proposed a joint research project to explore this\u000d\u000a      possibility to Dr Penty and his\u000d\u000a      colleague Professor White; together they wrote the proposal for the\u000d\u000a      collaborative project \"Fibre-Radio\u000d\u000a      for In-Building Distributed Antenna Systems (FRIDAY)\". This was funded\u000d\u000a      under the EPSRC-DTI\u000d\u000a      LINK scheme, with project partners Agilent Technologies (UK) Ltd and\u000d\u000a      Airtech Ltd, and\u000d\u000a      undertaken between 2001 and 2004 between UCL and the University of\u000d\u000a      Cambridge (Dr, later\u000d\u000a      Professor Penty and Professor White having moved to Cambridge). The UCL PI\u000d\u000a      was Professor A J\u000d\u000a      Seeds and the Research Associate was Dr D Wake (2001-2003). The UCL\u000d\u000a      researchers showed\u000d\u000a      for the first time that it was indeed possible to transmit wireless\u000d\u000a      signals over multimode fibre\u000d\u000a      without down-conversion [2]. The FRIDAY research showed that it was\u000d\u000a      possible to carry multiple\u000d\u000a      wireless services (such as cellular and Wi-Fi) over a single optical\u000d\u000a      fibre, and that multimode optical\u000d\u000a      fibre could be used to carry wireless services with carrier frequencies\u000d\u000a      beyond its -3 dB (electrical)\u000d\u000a      frequency cut-off reliably (&lt; 4 dB\/km, 3 GHz). This led to a joint\u000d\u000a      UCL\/Cambridge patent [3].\u000d\u000a    The inventors named on the patent are Professor Seeds and Dr Wake (UCL),\u000d\u000a      and Professors\u000d\u000a      Penty and White, together with Dr Webster and Dr Hartmann (Cambridge). The\u000d\u000a      revenue-sharing\u000d\u000a      agreement confirms that the contributions of the UCL and Cambridge teams\u000d\u000a      to the intellectual\u000d\u000a      property are equal [3].The patented technology has enabled multiple\u000d\u000a      wireless services to be\u000d\u000a      carried on a single multimode fibre, offering a major cost reduction [4,\u000d\u000a      5].\u000d\u000a    Professor Seeds and Dr Wake, with Professors Penty and White from\u000d\u000a      Cambridge, and Dr Parker\u000d\u000a      (CEO of SPI Lasers), founded the company Zinwave Ltd in November 2002 to\u000d\u000a      exploit the research\u000d\u000a      commercially. On behalf of the patent owners (UCL and Cambridge), UCL\u000d\u000a      licensed patent\u000d\u000a      WO2004056019 and associated know-how to the company in 2003.\u000d\u000a    To facilitate transfer of UCL radio-over-fibre technology to Zinwave,\u000d\u000a      Professor Seeds obtained an\u000d\u000a      EPSRC Research Associate Industrial Secondment (RAIS) grant of value &#163;36.5\u000d\u000a      k, enabling radio-over-fibre\u000d\u000a      researcher Dr Chin-Pang Liu to work at Zinwave half time for two years,\u000d\u000a      commencing\u000d\u000a      May 2004.

In addition, port\u000a      authorities have greater assurance\u000a        that ships will be able to berth quickly and safely.\u000a    The new approach to active target design conceived by Brennan and based\u000a      on SSB modulated\u000a      backscatter, and demonstration of its effectiveness in both reducing the\u000a      signal processing burden\u000a      and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and operating range, led directly\u000a      to the adoption of a new\u000a      technique across the entire Guidance Microwave Ltd. product range, as\u000a      indicated in the following\u000a      extract of a letter (in April 2012) from the Managing Director of Guidance\u000a      Microwave Ltd:\u000a    \"In 2008 we were developing a 24GHz positioning system for use on\u000a        land, based on our existing\u000a        9GHz positioning system used for local positioning of ships (RadaScan).\u000a        We were developing an\u000a        Active Target to replace the very large and bulky Van Atta targets for\u000a        RadaScan and wished to do\u000a        the same for the Portscan system. We contracted your services to help\u000a        with the development of\u000a        the system concept and this resulted in the outline design for the\u000a        Active Target. This design has\u000a        successfully been patented.\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    \"The Active Target has since been developed for the RadaScan system\u000a        and has been a very\u000a        successful product for our company. All of the old Van Atta targets have\u000a        been replaced with the\u000a        new and much smaller Active Targets. To date, we have sold approximately\u000a        280 Active targets\u000a      [700 as of July 2013] with current sales of approximately 25 per\u000a        month. Along with the RadaScan\u000a        sensors, this is very good business for our company and we are grateful\u000a        your support.\"\u000a    Commercial benefits: The forerunner to this active target\u000a    design used multiple antennas and\u000a    amplifiers in a Van Atta array configuration in order to achieve\u000a    satisfactory operation. The inherent\u000a    9-fold signal strength improvement of the new active target has convinced\u000a    Guidance Microwave\u000a    Ltd. to drop the Van Atta approach and use a simpler single-channel active\u000a    target configuration,\u000a    which actually confers improved performance: testing on mini-Radascan\u000a    performed by Guidance\u000a    Ltd in 2010 indicated a substantial improvement in operating range.\u000a    The impact of this adoption of new technology based on Brennan's research\u000a      is two-fold: firstly, by\u000a      reducing the signal processing burden it allows the cheaper and easier\u000a        production of (smaller)\u000a      active targets based on a single pair of antennas rather than multiple Van\u000a      Atta pairs and, in\u000a      particular, it reduces the signal processing and RF demands on the radar\u000a      system that interrogates\u000a      those targets; secondly, it provides better performance via a\u000a        substantially increased operating\u000a        range. The ability to develop better products at a lower cost has\u000a      conferred a significant competitive\u000a      advantage upon Guidance Microwave Ltd, whose products now outperform those\u000a      of their\u000a      competitors despite the lower cost of their production. Such products have\u000a      been very successful\u000a      for the company, and now 100% of their production has moved to the new\u000a        design proposed\u000a        by Brennan. Guidance Microwave Ltd. began to deploy the new active\u000a      target in 2009, switching\u000a      over its entire product range before the end of 2010. The fact that\u000a      Brennan's design allows for\u000a      cheaper and easier production also means that Guidance Microwave Ltd.\u000a      profits have been\u000a      impacted positively: mini-Radascan is now the most successful Guidance\u000a      product in terms of\u000a      sales, according to the Managing Director of Guidance Microwave Ltd,\u000a      generating sales of more\u000a        than &#163;3 million. In 2010 and 2011 UK and US patent applications\u000a      were filed to protect the\u000a      technique.\u000a    Wider benefits to the shipping industry: The unrivalled\u000a      performance and efficient architecture\u000a      afforded by this technique has helped Guidance Microwave Ltd to become the\u000a      market leaders in\u000a      this area. However, the technology has also benefitted the shipping\u000a      industry (which contributed\u000a      &#163;12.5bn to UK GDP in 2011) much more broadly &#8212; including major oil\u000a      companies &#8212; by providing a\u000a      short-range navigation solution with the best possible performance.\u000a      Guidance Microwave\u000a      Ltd. estimate that around 300 ships and oil rigs currently have the\u000a      technology installed.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A new product has been developed to aid marine navigation and berthing at\u000a      ports, based on the\u000a      use of a single-sideband (SSB) active target, offering the dual benefits\u000a      of substantially enhanced\u000a      performance, and reduced size and production costs. The research has\u000a      achieved significant\u000a      commercial impact via the incorporation of the technique, conceived by\u000a      Brennan, into all such\u000a      targets made by Guidance Microwave Ltd, a UK-based engineering company\u000a      specialising in the\u000a      development, manufacture and supply of short-range active target location\u000a      systems.

As a result of the reputation for expertise\u000a      he developed through\u000a      previous work in RF systems and radar, Brennan was approached by Guidance\u000a      Microwave Ltd. in\u000a      2008 for advice on the development of their active target location systems\u000a      operating at 9 GHz, and\u000a      on a planned new system at 24 GHz. These systems are used to help ships\u000a      navigate in, and berth\u000a      at, ports, and at other structures such as oil rigs. A critical evaluation\u000a      of Guidance Microwave Ltd.'s\u000a      systems [3] was performed in 2008 by Brennan's team, including Kevin\u000a      Chetty (then a Research\u000a      Associate at UCL; now a Lecturer in its Department of Security &amp; Crime\u000a      Science). This research\u000a      particularly analysed the system's existing demodulation configuration\u000a      with a view to improving\u000a      system functionality, efficiency and reliability, whilst retaining &#8212; and\u000a      indeed enhancing &#8212; its\u000a      commercial viability.\u000a    A number of new ideas emerged from this research [4-6] in particular a\u000a      technique offering a\u000a      substantial improvement to the active target modulation system, which was\u000a      of clear value to\u000a      Guidance Microwave Ltd. In the original Guidance system, the active\u000a      targets used modulated\u000a      backscatter based on on-off keying (OOK) modulation at 125 kb\/s of a\u000a      1.75\/2.5 MHz frequency-shift\u000a      keyed (FSK) modulated subcarrier to indicate their identities. The\u000a      challenge in demodulating\u000a      these signals in order to recover the data is that the sub-carrier\u000a      frequencies, at intermediate\u000a      frequency (IF), are much greater than the carrier frequencies, leading to\u000a      spectrum foldover and\u000a      difficulty in recovering the data. This is conventionally managed by using\u000a      IQ demodulation,\u000a      requiring two signal channels in the subsequent digital signal processing.\u000a      However, the UCL study\u000a      revealed that if the active transponder were to single-sideband modulate\u000a      the incident radar signal\u000a      to produce a subcarrier at only the sum (or difference) frequency, then\u000a      there would be no issue of\u000a      spectrum foldover and data recovery could be readily performed without the\u000a      need for IQ\u000a      processing, halving the burden on the digital signal processing. An\u000a      outline design of the hardware\u000a      required to achieve this function was presented to the company in 2008,\u000a      using digital quadrature\u000a      generation of the modulated subcarrier (125 kb\/s on a 2.5 MHz subcarrier)\u000a      with a minimum of\u000a      additional components. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis demonstrated\u000a      that the proposed\u000a      approach also offered a significant improvement in performance that would\u000a      lead to greater\u000a      operating range.\u000a    Guidance Microwave Ltd. explored this idea when Brennan presented it to\u000a      them in 2008 and were\u000a      very pleased with the results. Not only was a signal-to-noise-ratio\u000a      improvement of some 9 dB\u000a      obtained in all of their active target products, due to the avoidance of\u000a      issues associated with\u000a      spectrum foldover, but the new circuitry in the active targets was around\u000a      50% cheaper and less\u000a      complex than the circuitry it replaced. Subsequent testing conducted in\u000a      2010 revealed that the\u000a      operating range of these systems was increased by around 50% as a result\u000a      of the new targets.\u000a      This meant that the performance of a newer Guidance product, mini-Radascan,\u000a      approached that of\u000a      the larger Radascan system, making it particularly attractive to\u000a      customers with smaller vessels\u000a      and\/or reduced budgets.\u000a    Since 2008, Brennan has continued to work with Guidance Microwave Ltd. on\u000a      a range of areas of\u000a      interest, including the development of a radically new approach to active\u000a      target location, now the\u000a      subject of a separate patent application. Work to demonstrate the\u000a      feasibility of this new technique\u000a      is nearing completion and a demonstrator was trialled in field tests in\u000a      summer 2013.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33271","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research within CIMS has allowed the development of a\u000a      chromatic sensing methodology allowing cost-effective monitoring systems.\u000a      The CIMS system has been used to interpret complex and emergent conditions\u000a      in several real world applications. This has led to significant\u000a          economic, societal and environmental impact\u000a      with national and large international reach.\u000a      There are currently ten different organisations utilising the technology,\u000a      benefitting the UK economy and health care provision both nationally and\u000a      internationally. The impact includes, but is not limited to, the four\u000a      specific examples given below:\u000a    1. Time domain chromaticity with optical fibre, acoustic sensing\u000a      developed at Liverpool [3.1, 3.3], has been retrofitted onto High Voltage\u000a      transformers in sub stations operated by Electricity North West Ltd (ENWL)\u000a      and Western Power (WP). CIMS engaged Manchester-based manufacturer (MHA\u000a      Lighting [5.3]) to build monitoring units. 35 units have now been produced\u000a      and installed in ENWL substations in the Midlands and the North West,\u000a      allowing early detection of incipient switching faults. This has resulted\u000a      in an important contribution to the provision of reliable electric power\u000a      supplies nationally. The resulting impact is therefore upon both industry\u000a      and society in general via reduction of the risk of widespread power\u000a      disruption. Furthermore: \"Without these monitoring units\u000a          and the chromatic processing methodology, ENWL would not achieve some\u000a          of its regulatory aims and objectives in terms of the future energy\u000a          infrastructure\" [5.1].\u000a    2. Space domain chromaticity with 2D digital camera imaging developed at\u000a      CIMS has been used to monitor growth of bacterial colonies in urine [3.1].\u000a      This led to the development of the MAST \"UriPlus\" urine monitor which was\u000a      then evaluated by 3 independent hospitals and one medical laboratory\u000a      [5.4]. Following successful field trials the UriPlus instrument was\u000a      launched in 2011. To date, there have been 25 units manufactured.\u000a      Furthermore there are 5-year consumables contracts in place with end-users\u000a      (from 2012 and ongoing). This represents a revenue income stream of &#163;2.5\u000a      million over the 5 year period in question [5.2]. In addition to economic\u000a      benefits, the MAST UriPlus monitor provides improved diagnosis of health\u000a      threatening conditions for medical patients, through the urine screening\u000a      product because of its higher accuracy and ease of use: \"...MAST\u000a          UriPlus was found to be a much improved instrument over the Matascan\u000a          Elite in ease of use, speed of use, user friendly software and\u000a          improved accuracy\" [5.4]\u000a    Further research and development regarding space domain chromaticity has\u000a      also been applied for the detection of antibiotic effectiveness to treat\u000a      bacterial infections. This has been transferred from CIMS to MAST via a\u000a      KTP award. The researcher trained during in the project, as the KTP\u000a      associate, is now employed by MAST. Chromaticity is embedded in the new\u000a      MAST instrument, funded through this KTP award. The resulting performance\u000a      of the instrument is superior to previous versions [5.3] and \"...reduces\u000a          waste and carbon foot print\" [5.8].\u000a    3. Optical domain chromaticity [3.1] for skin tissue monitoring is being\u000a      used internationally. An inexpensive mobile phone camera-based chromatic\u000a      system is being used at the Thengana Medical Mission Hospital &amp;\u000a      Research Centre (TMMHRC) and 3 hospitals in South India for the live\u000a      monitoring of jaundice in newly born infants (from 2010). \"The scale\u000a          of the sociological importance is reflected in the fact that 9\u000a          million babies are born in India each year and neonatal\u000a          hyperbilirubinemia occurs in more than 60% of late preterm and term\u000a          newborns\" [5.5]. The CIMS system allows poorer sections of the\u000a      population, in remote areas, to have access to improved diagnosis with\u000a      consequent improvement in healthcare.\u000a    4. Space- and time-domain chromaticity with optical and infra-red sensing\u000a      [3.1] has been employed for the non-intrusive assistive care of the\u000a          elderly in the UK.

Chromaticity mimics the human\u000a      sensory systems such as, colour vision, hearing, taste, smell etc. It does\u000a      this by extracting relevant information about complex and emerging\u000a      conditions, without a surfeit of data. To give a simple example, the eye\u000a      can detect very subtle differences in colour with the equivalent of only 3\u000a      spectrally overlapping detectors, whereas a man-made spectrometer may\u000a      capture 1000 separate data points (non-overlapping) but fail to\u000a      detect those subtle differences.\u000a    Research: The underpinning research in the Department established\u000a      that using 3 spectrally overlapping detectors, efficient and\u000a      cost-effective monitoring systems could be produced which outperform\u000a      traditional measurement systems in monitoring complex and emergent\u000a      conditions. The ground-breaking nature of the research is reflected by the\u000a      large number of scientific papers (&gt; 30 since 2006) published in\u000a      high-quality scientific and engineering journals of professional\u000a      Institutions. The book [3.1] is a collation of the main points reported in\u000a      the &gt;30 peer reviewed papers.\u000a    Further research has developed the chromaticity approach into different\u000a      physical domains &#8212; optical, acoustic, electromagnetic, space, time,\u000a      frequency etc [3.2, 3.3 and 3.4]. As a consequence impending faults in,\u000a      for example, power systems and early development of medical conditions can\u000a      be diagnosed before they become critical. This requires understanding the\u000a      fundamental principles governing the quality and trustworthiness of\u000a      information embedded in the chromatic values in these domains.\u000a    The chromaticity method was pioneered by the Centre for\u000a          Intelligent Monitoring Systems (CIMS) in the Department (http:\/\/www.cims.org.uk\u000a      ) and resulted in 2 generic patent awards [3.5,3.6]. The research quality\u000a      is also indicated by the substantial research funding (&gt;&#163;3.0M) from\u000a      several sources (EPSRC, EU, Industry etc). There has been substantial\u000a      involvement from senior scientists internationally and prestigious awards\u000a      received (Achievement Medal IEE Science, Education and Technology\u000a      Division), Medal of Distinction (Bulgarian Academy of Science), North West\u000a      Innovation Lecture, UK).\u000a    Key Dates: The research for the applications described above, was\u000a      initiated in 1995 and evolved through more generic aspects of the\u000a      methodology, to culminate in 2000 with the exploration of deployment in\u000a      other areas in addition to optical fibre applications. These included: (i)\u000a      space- location, time-domain and behavioural monitoring associated with\u000a      assistive care for the elderly from 2000 [3.2]; (ii) acoustic monitoring\u000a      of high voltage transformer switching from 2006 [3.3]; and (iii)\u000a      monitoring of industrial liquids, namely high voltage insulating oils from\u000a      2009 onwards, petroleum fuels between 2006 and 2010 [3.4], biological\u000a      fluids, tissue and bacteria monitoring from 2006 onwards and finally the\u000a      use of intercontinental transmission of chromatic parameters (2008 -\u000a      ongoing).\u000a    Key researchers: Professor J.

MS\u000d\u000a      can be exploited to analyse gases, liquids, and solids. MS instruments are\u000d\u000a      therefore capable of answering the questions: what substance is it?, how\u000d\u000a      much is there?, and how is it changing in time?.\u000d\u000a    Research: The underpinning research stems from work undertaken\u000d\u000a      from the mid-1990's and onwards. Taylor recognised that a miniature\u000d\u000a      quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) fabricated using micro-engineering\u000d\u000a      (MEMS) techniques offers the advantages of greater portability at reduced\u000d\u000a      cost. A miniature QMS would allow new applications for online monitoring\u000d\u000a      in the security, environmental, oil, gas and medical fields. In\u000d\u000a      collaboration with researchers from Imperial College of Science Technology\u000d\u000a      and Medicine (ICSTM) a patent was initially filed for the invention of the\u000d\u000a      world's smallest mass spectrometer at that time [3.1]. The inventive step\u000d\u000a      was then developed initially under collaborative EPSRC awards GR\/K54755\u000d\u000a      (from 1996-98) and GR\/M 31279 from (1999-2001). This initial research\u000d\u000a      demonstrated proof-of-concept by producing a prototype micro-engineered\u000d\u000a      Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS) which was successful in acquiring mass\u000d\u000a      spectra of common atmospheric gases [3.2]. This miniature QMS was\u000d\u000a          the smallest of its type in the world and the first to be\u000d\u000a          micro-engineered in silicon. The research work defined the\u000d\u000a      criteria by which miniature and micro-engineered QMS devices could be\u000d\u000a      designed, built and tested [3.3]. The micro-QMS was able to operate in a\u000d\u000a      higher pressure regime than had been previously demonstrated. A unique\u000d\u000a      computer simulation model was also developed at UoL comprising a\u000d\u000a      combination of custom and commercially available software with the ability\u000d\u000a      to model QMS performance to an unprecedented level of accuracy. Previous\u000d\u000a      computer models were restricted by imprecise electric field calculations\u000d\u000a      and the relatively small number of ions that could be modelled. The UoL\u000d\u000a      software determines electric fields to a precision of 1 part in 1012\u000d\u000a      and is unique in the large number (typically 108) of ions\u000d\u000a      simulated [3.4].\u000d\u000a    In summary, the underpinning experimental and theoretical work from\u000d\u000a      1996-2008 resulted in: the demonstration of the world's smallest QMS; 22\u000d\u000a      publications in peer-reviewed international journals, 20 conference\u000d\u000a      publications; and 10 invitations to speak at meetings in UK, Europe and\u000d\u000a      the USA, including the American Vacuum Symposium (AVS, Seattle, 1999),\u000d\u000a      International Vacuum Congress (IVC, San Francisco, 2001), and PITTCON\u000d\u000a      (2002 and 2003). A further five patents were filed from 1998 to 2006\u000d\u000a      [3.5]. The underpinning research also led to work in related areas e.g.\u000d\u000a      including the development of other forms quadrupole mass filters and also\u000d\u000a      of miniature ion traps for quantum computing [3.6].\u000d\u000a    Key dates: Underpinning research: 1993 onwards.

Two\u000a      specific beneficiaries are:\u000a      Guidance and Zetica.\u000a    The work with Guidance Navigation Ltd began with an EPSRC research grant\u000a      (GR\/S12845\/01)\u000a      which then lead to a KTP award (KTP006498 from 2007 to 2009 for &#163;262,452).\u000a      Guidance is a\u000a      leading developer and supplier of sophisticated navigation and position\u000a      measurement systems.\u000a      When Guidance began to work with Liverpool in 2005, the company employed\u000a      about 30 people.\u000a      Now the company has expanded to three groups working in navigation,\u000a      monitoring and\u000a      microwaves with over 120 employees. The company has benefited greatly from\u000a      two innovative\u000a      solutions from the research described above: one was a smart and\u000a      cost-effective diversity antenna\u000a      system for their offender tagging system, which has significantly improved\u000a      the system reliability\u000a      and operational range. The other one was a specially designed reflector\u000a      antenna which could\u000a      produce a narrow horizontal beam but a broad vertical beam for marine\u000a      guidance and navigation.\u000a    Guidance has provided electronic tagging systems for use in offender\u000a      monitoring since 2000.\u000a      However, there was a serious problem with the system: the RF communication\u000a      link between the\u000a      tag and the receiver was not reliable and sometimes caused false alarms,\u000a      potentially disastrous\u000a      since offenders might be falsely accused of breaching their home curfew\u000a      terms. Huang and\u000a      colleagues identified that the unreliable radio link was mainly caused by\u000a      the unoptimised antenna.\u000a      A cost-effective polarisation diversity antenna system based on our\u000a      original work [3.1, 3.2], was\u000a      developed and implemented by Liverpool, has significantly improved the\u000a      system performance. As a\u000a      result security of offenders has increased, the public policy relating to\u000a      offender management has\u000a      improved and Guidance has outperformed its competitors and won new\u000a      contracts. For example, in\u000a      the UK its market share has gone up from 20% (2005) to over 70% (2010);\u000a      and it has also helped\u000a      the company to win contracts overseas (e.g. the USA and France). In\u000a      addition, in 2006 the\u000a      company won the Queen's Innovation Award for this product. In 2011,\u000a      Guidance Monitoring\u000a      division was bought by G4S (a global security company) for over &#163;10m due\u000a      to the outstanding\u000a      performance and profitability of the well developed tagging system [5.1].\u000a    Around 2005, Guidance was developing a new product, \"RadaScan\", a\u000a      microwave-based range\u000a      and bearing measuring system for the marine and offshore dynamic\u000a      positioning market. One of the\u000a      main challenges was the antenna which should be small (&lt; 0.5 m x 0.5 m)\u000a      and have a narrow\u000a      radiation beam-width (&lt; 2 degrees) in the horizontal plane, but a broad\u000a      one (&gt; 15 degrees) in the\u000a      vertical plane. Guidance approached Liverpool where an in-depth study was\u000a      conducted and an\u000a      innovative antenna was successfully designed using the Liverpool research,\u000a      developed and\u000a      implemented by Guidance: \"All the major specifications were\u000a          achieved. This product was a\u000a          great success and has now become the best selling product for Guidance\u000a          Navigation Ltd\u000a          and generated the major income stream for the Company The company size\u000a          has grown\u000a          from about 40 people in 2005 to more than 100 people in 2012\"\u000a      The income stream generated\u000a      was \"...about &#163;6m in 2011\" [5.1].\u000a    Collaboration with Zetica Ltd has been going on for over 10 years. A\u000a      feasibility study for\u000a      unexploded ordinance started in 2005 which resulted in a KTP award in Feb.\u000a      2008 (KTP006540 for\u000a      &#163;217,220) for 2.5 years to develop this idea into a product. Zetica is a\u000a      UK leader in environmental\u000a      geophysics with a reputation for cost effective surveys. Redevelopment of\u000a      previous used land is a\u000a      key element of national planning policy. When a construction project\u000a      starts, it normally begins with\u000a      a survey to ensure the safety and suitability for the project. Common\u000a      practice is to drill many holes\u000a      to identify subsurface features. However, this process was slow and\u000a      sometimes dangerous due to\u000a      occasional unexploded subsurface ordnance (UXO), e.g. from WWII. This can\u000a      be a significant\u000a      problem for development for dense urban areas (e.g. London), where bombing\u000a      was of high\u000a      frequency. The research work on intelligent drilling systems at Liverpool\u000a      [3.4-3.5] provided an\u000a      excellent solution to this problem. The system comprises a new\u000a      magnetometer and wireless\u000a      communication unit, enabling the ground information near the borehole to\u000a      be obtained. The\u000a      unexploded subsurface ordnance can be located and identified with greatly\u000a      improved efficiency\u000a      and personnel safety. \"This unique product has enabled Zetica to\u000a          provide far more economic\u000a          and flexible service\". Liverpool's expertise in antennas: \"...has\u000a          enabled [Zetica] to explore new\u000a          business opportunities around the world... related services are now a\u000a          significant part of the\u000a          company's portfolio\" [5.2].\u000a    The impact achieved has arisen directly from the underpinning research\u000a      undertaken solely at\u000a      Liverpool. Our contribution has not only directly helped the companies to\u000a      produce new products,\u000a      improve performance and win contracts, but an additional benefit is that\u000a      both the working\u000a      environment and company personnel safety have been improved.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In this case study, two specific examples of impact are reported.

It is an essential part of modern wireless systems,\u000a      such as mobile\u000a      telephones and radar. \u000a    Research: Antennas are essential for any RF system. A good antenna\u000a      can significantly improve\u000a      the system performance without increasing the cost and energy consumption.\u000a      Huang has\u000a      developed novel antenna designs. The scope of his innovative designs are\u000a      reviewed in his book\u000a      [3.1], international conference proceedings [3.2] and journal papers\u000a      [3.3]. Since 2001, he has\u000a      conducted extensive research into antennas for radio positioning and\u000a      tracking applications using\u000a      an antenna diversity technique [3.2]. This technique normally uses at\u000a      least two separated\u000a      antennas, with different polarisations, to improve the quality of the\u000a      received signal (i.e. enhanced\u000a      signal-to-noise ratio), which is extremely important for communications\u000a      and positioning systems in\u000a      multipath (e.g. indoor) environments. However, this technique cannot be\u000a      easily applied in all\u000a      applications due to constraints such as space, especially for portable\u000a      devices. Special designs and\u000a      original ideas are therefore required. A comprehensive study of antenna\u000a      diversity has been\u000a      undertaken at Liverpool, with funding from the EPSRC and industry. Novel\u000a      designs have been\u000a      proposed, including one which uses the same radiator but different feeding\u000a      ports to realise the\u000a      diversity [3.3]. This solution is not only cost-effective, but also\u000a      space-efficient. This underpinning\u000a      innovation was later implemented by Guidance.\u000a    Another important research project conducted in the RF engineering group\u000a      at Liverpool from 2005\u000a      addressed the problem of detecting unexploded ordnance below the surface\u000a      (including bombs\u000a      dropped during WWII). Conventional practice uses ground penetrating radar\u000a      (GPR). This method is\u000a      good for detecting shallow objects, but the challenge was how to detect\u000a      and identify deeply-buried\u000a      ones. A novel technique of using a borehole magnetometer with a wireless\u000a      link was developed by\u000a      Huang and colleagues at Liverpool [3.4-3.6]. This approach, which included\u000a      both hardware and\u000a      complex data interpretation software, was based on a full-wave\u000a      electromagnetic model. The\u000a      advantage of this approach is that nearby unexploded ordnance can be\u000a      accurately located and\u000a      identified at the same time as drilling the boreholes used for\u000a      pre-construction ground surveys [3.4-3.6].\u000a    Key dates: The work with Guidance began with an EPSRC research\u000a      grant (GR\/S12845\/01 from\u000a      2003 to 2005 for &#163;128k) where antenna diversity was investigated.\u000a    Key researchers: Professor Y.

The research has\u000d\u000a      also had an environmental impact by making structures safer and more\u000d\u000a      efficient through the cost effect integration of smart technology.\u000d\u000a    To understand how this relates to Aston University, it is necessary to\u000d\u000a      look further back and, in doing so, highlight additional commercial\u000d\u000a      activities that have a connection to Aston research. Aston was pivotal in\u000d\u000a      the development of this technology in the UK through continued support of\u000d\u000a      companies seeking to explore commercial opportunities in this area. The\u000d\u000a      impact over the period of interest, shown on the right of the figure, is\u000d\u000a      as a result of a long period of working with a number of companies\u000d\u000a      enabling technology transfer in this area. It also results from previous\u000d\u000a      spin-outs and IP generation. A timeline charting some key events\u000d\u000a      surrounding this work is shown below:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aFigure 1: schematic tracing the complex relationship between commercial activity in FBG sensing and Aston\u000d\u000aresearch (the dates of company formations and key events are shown in brackets).\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a     Aston was one of the first universities in the world to work on FBG\u000d\u000a      sensing [1]. An early collaboration with Carbospars and BAE Systems\u000d\u000a      resulted in the formation of Smart Fibres [A]. The FBG technology\u000d\u000a      developed was featured on Tomorrow's World in 1999 raising the profile of\u000d\u000a      the technology and company and Smart Fibres has continued to build on this\u000d\u000a      FBG sensing expertise and is widely respected in the industry [A]. In\u000d\u000a        2012, this company employed 23 people in the UK and had a turnover of\u000d\u000a        &#163;1.5 million. The company works in structural health monitoring in\u000d\u000a      areas such as oil and gas, marine, aerospace, civil engineering, medical\u000d\u000a      and sports. The technology enables the safe operation of equipment and\u000d\u000a        structures.\u000d\u000a    Indigo Photonics Ltd was formed as an Aston spin-out by Dr Sugden, along\u000d\u000a      with Professors Bennion and Zhang, in May 2001. Collaborative research\u000d\u000a      resulted in the filing of the key sensor interrogator patent in December\u000d\u000a      2002 [3.4, 3.5, 5B]. Following an intense period of collaborative work,\u000d\u000a      Insensys Ltd acquired Indigo Photonics in August 2003 [C] and continued to\u000d\u000a      develop and commercialise this sensor technology [D]. About the sale Mike\u000d\u000a      Sibson of 3i said \"We co-founded Indigo Photonics with the management team\u000d\u000a      and Aston University, and we have been active in delivering the benefits\u000d\u000a      of our global network as it has grown and developed its technology. The\u000d\u000a      acquisition by Insensys will make a powerful combination...\" [C]. The\u000d\u000a      technological advantages that the system had, allowing it to be used\u000d\u000a      effectively in vibrating structures such as wind turbines, gave the\u000d\u000a      company a significant technical advantage over competitors. Of the\u000d\u000a      technology Robert Brogue later said \"this new technique allows sensor\u000d\u000a      costs to be reduced dramatically and also yields operational benefits\"\u000d\u000a      [D]. Insensys was split into three business units &#8212; Oil &amp; Gas, Wind\u000d\u000a      Energy [E] and Aerospace and two parts continue to be a significant UK\u000d\u000a      employer.\u000d\u000a    In May 2007, Schlumberger (the world's leading supplier of technology,\u000d\u000a      integrated project management and information solutions to customers\u000d\u000a      working in the oil and gas industry) announced the purchase for an\u000d\u000a      undisclosed amount of the Oil &amp; Gas division of Insensys, recognising\u000d\u000a      the unique nature of its technology [F]. The technology is still in use\u000d\u000a      monitoring the structure integrity of oil risers.\u000d\u000a    This was followed by the acquisition of the Wind division of Insensys by\u000d\u000a      US company Moog (a worldwide designer, manufacturer, and integrator of\u000d\u000a      precision motion control products and systems) in November 2009 for\u000d\u000a      US$15.7 million [G]. Moog Insensys employs ~23 people in the UK working in\u000d\u000a      the wind turbine technology area (June 2013). The impact is therefore\u000d\u000a        in their continued business and employment. The technology developed\u000d\u000a      during Dr Lloyd's PhD is a key part of their product portfolio. It is\u000d\u000a      estimated that a significant proportion of the &#163;30 million revenue that\u000d\u000a      the business has generated would have been unlikely to have happened\u000d\u000a      without the technology since it offers lower cost, greater flexibility and\u000d\u000a      inherent increased reliability than competitors [H]. Combined with the\u000d\u000a      commercial knowledge and composite expertise from the company it provided\u000d\u000a      a highly competitive offering. Moog was awarded the Queen's Award for\u000d\u000a      Enterprise in 2010 due to contributions to UK Export [J] after selling\u000d\u000a      over 800 interrogation systems in two years.\u000d\u000a    In this sector the technology [5] has an environmental impact, especially\u000d\u000a      in the safe running of large wind turbines where the health of the\u000d\u000a      structures can be monitored during operation and active pitch control of\u000d\u000a      the blades can be implemented. It enables the efficiency of the turbines\u000d\u000a      to be optimised and ensures they operate within given safety parameters\u000d\u000a      [I]. This work was enabled by the development of the compact sensor\u000d\u000a      interrogator since, unlike the competitors; the device was low cost, small\u000d\u000a      and contained no moving parts.\u000d\u000a    A further company, Astasense Ltd, was formed in 2007 by Dr Sugden and\u000d\u000a      Professors Webb, Zhang and Bennion. The company originally offered\u000d\u000a      consultancy services, but was invited to join an EU Framework 7 project\u000d\u000a      PHOSFOS. The company has generated further impact by employing a\u000d\u000a      total of 14 researchers since 2008, and in 2013 launching a fibre\u000d\u000a        interrogator system and polymer fibre FBGs based on the research at\u000d\u000a      Aston. This work was included in the British Science Festival exhibition\u000d\u000a      in 2012 bringing the technology to the public. Astasense (07\/13)\u000d\u000a      employs 3 people full time in the UK working in product development in\u000d\u000a      optical sensing directly based on expertise derived from Aston University,\u000d\u000a      the oil and gas sector is the main end user for current development work.\u000d\u000a      Webb and Sugden are also active participants in EU COST Action TD1001:\u000d\u000a      Novel and Reliable Optical Fibre Sensor Systems for Future Security and\u000d\u000a      Safety Applications (OFSeSa) where one of the key aims is to further\u000d\u000a      support the commercial development of this technology.\u000d\u000a     ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Aston's fibre Bragg grating research on optical sensing has had a global\u000d\u000a      commercial impact, in particular the development of low-cost fibre FBG\u000d\u000a      sensor interrogation methods.

The UK has a significant commercial presence in\u000d\u000a      this area. Aston researchers have been working in the field since the\u000d\u000a      start of 1993 when the Group was founded by Professor Ian Bennion (Head of\u000d\u000a      Group, 1992-2010) and has since expanded to become the Aston Institute of\u000d\u000a      Photonics Technologies (AIPT). Much of the early work in the UK on FBG\u000d\u000a      sensors was funded by DTI collaborative programmes. The first projects\u000d\u000a      were GIFTS (Gratings In Fibre Transmission Systems), which employed Dr Lin\u000d\u000a      Zhang (1994-present, now Professor) as a research fellow, and a BNR Europe\u000d\u000a      PhD studentship, which sponsored Dr Kate Sugden (PhD student, 1992-96,\u000d\u000a      visiting researcher 1999-2003, re-joined Aston 2003 as academic staff\u000d\u000a      member). In these projects, the expertise in FBG fabrication was developed\u000d\u000a      at Aston and included some notable world firsts (summarised in [3.1]) for:\u000d\u000a      design and fabrication of chirped FBGs, dispersion compensation with FBGs\u000d\u000a      and FBG resonator cavities.\u000d\u000a    The highly successful MAST (Maritime Applications Of Smart Structures\u000d\u000a      Technology) project followed, alongside the associated Carbospars CASE\u000d\u000a      sponsorship of Lorna Everall (1995-1999), and centred around the\u000d\u000a      development of embedded FBG strain sensor arrays primarily for carbon\u000d\u000a      fibre composite yacht masts. The key outcomes were: a relatively compact\u000d\u000a      sensor interrogator (4U, 19 inch rack sized); advanced understanding of\u000d\u000a      the interrogation and fabrication requirements e.g. [3.2]; exploration of\u000d\u000a      broader applications e.g. [3.3]. This project led to the formation of a\u000d\u000a      new optical sensing company, Smart Fibres, in 1996. At the end of MAST,\u000d\u000a      Smart Fibres employed Dr Everall (1999-2001) on a Teaching Company scheme\u000d\u000a      with Aston to continue the research and facilitate technology transfer.\u000d\u000a    A consistent issue that the collaborative projects faced was the cost of\u000d\u000a      the optical interrogation systems. At the time, this was upwards of &#163;30k\u000d\u000a      and posed a significant commercial hurdle. The cost came from a reliance\u000d\u000a      on expensive tunable laser of optical spectrum analyser technology. In\u000d\u000a      2001, Indigo Photonics (IP), an Aston photonics spin-out, and the\u000d\u000a      Photonics Group set up a small research team at Aston specifically to\u000d\u000a      research the area of low-cost interrogation systems This team included\u000d\u000a      Glyn Lloyd (IP employee \/ Aston PhD student (2001-2005), Dr Everall (IP),\u000d\u000a      Professor Bennion and Dr Sugden (then CTO of IP and visiting researcher at\u000d\u000a      Aston(1999-2004)).\u000d\u000a    The successful outcome of this research was a system design that utilised\u000d\u000a      emerging semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) technology to create an\u000d\u000a      amplifying system that could lock onto an FBG located at a specific\u000d\u000a      distance away from the interrogation unit by matching the frequency of the\u000d\u000a      SOA to the time of flight of the light pulses. This enabled the wavelength\u000d\u000a      of the FBGs to be measured using a simple spectrometer since it was\u000d\u000a      possible to average the light received over time. This overcame a key\u000d\u000a      problem of time division multiplexed (TDM) systems, where the detection\u000d\u000a      system typically has to operate very quickly at the expense of sensitivity\u000d\u000a      and noise. Importantly the system contained no moving parts making it a\u000d\u000a      very reliable solution for vibration rich environments thereby offering\u000d\u000a      significant performance advantages over competing technologies. It\u000d\u000a      resulted in the resonant cavity sensor interrogation system [3.4-3.5]\u000d\u000a      widely used by Moog and Schlumberger today. This system could be sold for\u000d\u000a      &lt;&#163;5k, a significant decrease in cost. Moreover, its reliance on time\u000d\u000a      division meant that all of the sensors could be low reflectivity and the\u000d\u000a      same wavelength, further reducing the system cost.\u000d\u000a    The work on low-cost interrogation systems continues. A Framework 7\u000d\u000a      project PHOSFOS resulted in several low-cost interrogation systems\u000d\u000a      operating at 850nm for healthcare applications (&lt;&#163;1,500 volume price) &#8212;\u000d\u000a      especially those targeted at the embedded polymer sensors developed by Dr\u000d\u000a      David Webb (2002-, now Professor) working with photonics consultancy\u000d\u000a      Astasense [3.6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37025","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The key impact is through the deployment of the optical communication\u000d\u000a      system in many countries,\u000d\u000a      for long distance communications, enabling internet traffic and associate\u000d\u000a      commercial and individual\u000d\u000a      activity. The system, developed from the research at Aston, currently\u000d\u000a      (2013) employs over 100\u000d\u000a      people in its development and sales\/support and has annual sales in the\u000d\u000a      region of $100M. The\u000d\u000a      impacts are therefore commercial for the company, its employees\u000d\u000a      and internet users across\u000d\u000a      much of the world, ie businesses, organisations and the public at\u000d\u000a      large.\u000d\u000a    The development of the impacts achieved later, were initiated when\u000d\u000a      Marconi, a\u000d\u000a      telecommunications company, approached the Aston team to lead the\u000d\u000a      commercial development of\u000d\u000a      a long distance, high capacity optical communication system based on their\u000d\u000a      research. As a\u000d\u000a      consequence of this approach, in mid-2000, Doran, Forysiak and four of the\u000d\u000a      post-doctoral research\u000d\u000a      assistants left Aston to start a new unit named Solstis within Marconi\u000d\u000a      [5.1], with Doran as Chief\u000d\u000a      Technology Officer. Extensive funding (several &#163;10s millions) was provided\u000d\u000a      by the company.\u000d\u000a      Between 2000 and 2003, the team grew to about 80 staff, with a core\u000d\u000a      complement of 15 photonics\u000d\u000a      engineers based on and led by the original Aston team.\u000d\u000a    Field trials at 5,745 km were reported at Optical Fiber\u000d\u000a        Communications Conference, 2003. The first\u000d\u000a      version of the system was deployed across Australia in early 2003 for\u000d\u000a      Amcom IP1 (Australia) Pty\u000d\u000a      Ltd. This system was then created, tested and installed without\u000d\u000a      regeneration across almost\u000d\u000a      3000km, from Adelaide to Perth by the team with the core leadership\u000d\u000a      provided by the original\u000d\u000a      Aston team. The soliton-based technology provided a cost-effective\u000d\u000a      solution for long-haul networks\u000d\u000a      in two key ways: first it removed the need for repeaters to convert and\u000d\u000a      retransmit electronic signals\u000d\u000a      over distance for clarity; and second it enabled quick and easy capacity\u000d\u000a      upgrades.\u000d\u000a    The product became the world leader in the field and when Marconi was\u000d\u000a      taken over by Ericsson in\u000d\u000a      2006, it was incorporated into the product portfolio of Ericsson under the\u000d\u000a      name Marconi Multihaul\u000d\u000a      (MHL) 3000 [5.2]. After the initial demonstration in Australia, the system\u000d\u000a      was sold and installed\u000d\u000a      commercially for implementation and operation worldwide [5.3].\u000d\u000a    Impact is therefore claimed since 2008, in the sales of systems\u000d\u000a      installed across the world and the\u000d\u000a      consequent employment of the staff required to develop and sell and\u000d\u000a      install the system. But the\u000d\u000a      impact of the system is greater than that since its role is to form the backbone\u000d\u000a        of the internet and\u000d\u000a      thus the impact could be said to extend to all who use the internet\u000d\u000a        where the system is\u000d\u000a        deployed [5.4]. The distance and capacity achieved by this system\u000d\u000a      are the key features which\u000d\u000a      have satisfied the ever growing internet traffic.\u000d\u000a    There is a large system in the UK now operated (and currently being\u000d\u000a      upgraded) by Vodafone\u000d\u000a      bought from Cable and Wireless in April 2012 as a major part of a $1Bn\u000d\u000a      acquisition, providing\u000d\u000a      meshed connectivity between ~30 major PoPs (Points of Presence), spanning\u000d\u000a      more than 20,500km\u000d\u000a      [5.5]. There are systems throughout Europe with operators such as Deutsche\u000d\u000a      Telekom, Telefonica,\u000d\u000a      Vodafone, Telecom Italia, and TeliaSonera. The Telstra inter-capital and\u000d\u000a      national networks in\u000d\u000a      Australia are dominated by this system. The networks mentioned above have\u000d\u000a      all been installed or\u000d\u000a      upgraded during the assessment period [5.6].\u000d\u000a    To date (2012\/13) Ericsson has sold over 17,000 network elements of this\u000d\u000a      system (an element\u000d\u000a      would typically compose of bi-directional amplification and dispersion\u000d\u000a      compensation) with total\u000d\u000a      sales of approaching $1Bn. It is estimated that \"around two thirds of\u000d\u000a        sales of MHL have occurred\u000d\u000a        during the impact period\" [5.7]; this would amount to &gt;$600m. The\u000d\u000a      system has been deployed and\u000d\u000a      is operated in 50 countries and with over 100 different buyers. Current\u000d\u000a      business generated\u000d\u000a      amounts to around $100M a year and has been at that level since 2008.\u000d\u000a      Ericsson has ~5% of the\u000d\u000a      world market for optical hardware valued at ~$15Bn a year. This system\u000d\u000a      remains a key product for\u000d\u000a      the company representing about 15% of their total optical hardware sales.\u000d\u000a      [5.7]. It is estimated that\u000d\u000a      over 100 people are employed currently (2013) on this system worldwide in\u000d\u000a      the development,\u000d\u000a      testing, installation and support.

The research identified herein was a crucial development in that\u000d\u000a      it paved the way for very\u000d\u000a      long distance (3000km) transmission without the need for regeneration of\u000d\u000a      the signals. This meant\u000d\u000a      that systems could be operated at very high capacity for cross-continent\u000d\u000a      distances and at a cost\u000d\u000a      which has allowed worldwide communication at high data rate.\u000d\u000a    The key research which led to the commercial system was the concept of\u000d\u000a      dispersion managed\u000d\u000a      solitons and WDM transmission in long distance links. This research was\u000d\u000a      led by Prof Nick Doran\u000d\u000a      who co-founded the Photonics Group at Aston in early 1990s and left to\u000d\u000a      join Marconi in May 2000.\u000d\u000a      He returned to Aston in November 2012. Other members of the original team\u000d\u000a      are also working at\u000d\u000a      Aston. Specifically Dr P Harper is a Reader and has been a member of staff\u000d\u000a      at Aston since March\u000d\u000a      2005. Drs I Phillips and M Stephens have been back at Aston since 2012 and\u000d\u000a      Dr W Forysiak\u000d\u000a      (Reader at Aston in 2000) has held a joint appointment between Aston and\u000d\u000a      Oclaro as a Royal\u000d\u000a      Society Industrial Research Fellow since October 2012.\u000d\u000a    A series of EPSRC grants enabled a substantial modelling and laboratory\u000d\u000a      programme to explore\u000d\u000a      and demonstrate the transmission capacity of soliton like pulses in an OOK\u000d\u000a      (on-off-keyed) 10Gb\/s\u000d\u000a      and subsequently 40Gb\/s symbol rate. The key breakthrough was the\u000d\u000a      discovery in 1995 [3.1] that\u000d\u000a      a suitable arrangement of dispersion compensation (called dispersion\u000d\u000a      management) enabled\u000d\u000a      soliton-like pulses to be stable over ultra-long distance. The key\u000d\u000a      surprise and finding was that the\u000d\u000a      dispersion compensation could allow solitons to be used over standard\u000d\u000a      (lowest loss) fibre. Hitherto\u000d\u000a      solitons had only been enabled over low dispersion fibre which has higher\u000d\u000a      loss and not compatible\u000d\u000a      with WDM. This concept was developed initially by modelling and computer\u000d\u000a      simulations and was\u000d\u000a      verified by detailed laboratory demonstrations. The research identified\u000d\u000a      the suitable dispersion map\u000d\u000a      for 10Gb\/s OOK RZ (return-to-zero) modulation and showed that this\u000d\u000a      modulation was superior in\u000d\u000a      stability to alternative modulations such as the standard NRZ\u000d\u000a      (Non-Return-to-Zero). The dispersion\u000d\u000a      management used the parameters of average dispersion and dispersion map\u000d\u000a      strength to match\u000d\u000a      with the required signal power. The design was encapsulated in a simple\u000d\u000a      map strength parameter,\u000d\u000a      S, first defined by the team [3.3]. This strength parameter was used in\u000d\u000a      the system design but was\u000d\u000a      further refined for the final operational system.\u000d\u000a    This research not only set out the system design but also identified how\u000d\u000a      the nonlinearity and\u000d\u000a      dispersion of high speed systems could be mitigated. In particular for\u000d\u000a      10Gb\/s systems it was\u000d\u000a      shown that standard fibre with compensation was superior to the new low\u000d\u000a      dispersion fibres such as\u000d\u000a      Truewave&#174; and LEAF&#174;. This was a counter culture\u000d\u000a      concept and the system subsequently designed\u000d\u000a      and operated was focussed on standard fibre. This is now accepted as the\u000d\u000a      optimum transmission\u000d\u000a      arrangement for all long distance high speed systems. The key concepts of\u000d\u000a      dispersion managed\u000d\u000a      solitons were published in a series of papers (refs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and\u000d\u000a      3.5). The first work [3.1]\u000d\u000a      established the stability of solitons in a lossless dispersion\u000d\u000a      compensating environment. We\u000d\u000a      identified the enhanced power and the Gaussian like nature of the stable\u000d\u000a      solutions (3.3) and looked\u000d\u000a      specifically at the situation with standard fibre as the transmission\u000d\u000a      fibre with periodic dispersion\u000d\u000a      compensation. In 3.6 we generalised the dispersion managed soliton concept\u000d\u000a      and defined simple\u000d\u000a      design rules.\u000d\u000a    The key researchers involved were:\u000d\u000a      Prof Nick Doran (Aston University 1991 to 2000 and 2012 to present) was\u000d\u000a      the team leader and\u000d\u000a      founder of the start-up enterprise Marconi-Solstis.\u000d\u000a      Dr Wladek Forysiak Lecturer\/Reader at Aston University (1993 -2000) and\u000d\u000a      since 2012\u000d\u000a      Aston\/Oclaro Royal Society Industrial Research Fellow.\u000d\u000a    Students and postdoctoral fellows involved with the team at the time\u000d\u000a      included: Dr P Harper, Dr S B\u000d\u000a      Alleston, Dr J H B Nijhof Dr D S Govan, Dr N J Smith, F Knox (PhD\u000d\u000a      student), A Berntson\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37232","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Head of Research and Development, EDF Energy, writes: `We have a\u000d\u000a        fifteen-year long relationship with the OU and consider its expertise in\u000d\u000a        combining small scale and large scale residual stress measurement\u000d\u000a        techniques, together with analytical modelling techniques, to be unique.'\u000d\u000a      [5.1].\u000d\u000a    The OU and Nuclear Electric measured residual stresses in a weld repair\u000d\u000a      [5.2], using neutron diffraction, following a steam leak at Hunterston\u000d\u000a      power station in 1997. This led to an OU\/British Energy research training\u000d\u000a      partnership (within the EU-funded thematic network TRAINSS, 1998-2001)\u000d\u000a      involving neutron diffraction measurements of residual stress in long and\u000d\u000a      short weld repairs [3.1]. These were the first measurements of their kind\u000d\u000a      and revealed the surprisingly severe nature of residual stress fields\u000d\u000a      associated with repairs which, most importantly, demonstrated that the\u000d\u000a      simplified 2-D finite element predictions of stresses at weld repairs\u000d\u000a      routinely used by British Energy to support safety cases for repairs were\u000d\u000a      not conservative. `This resulted in a multi-million pound program of\u000d\u000a        weld modelling development and validation at British Energy (2001&#8212;10) to\u000d\u000a        underwrite safety cases for repaired AGR [Advanced Gas-Cooled\u000d\u000a      Reactor] weldments prone to reheat cracking' [5.1]. The UK AGRs\u000d\u000a      operate at coolant temperatures significantly higher (over 600&#176;C) than the\u000d\u000a      water-cooled reactors used elsewhere in the world where temperatures are\u000d\u000a      below 350&#176;C: this is a demanding operating regime for ageing plant\u000d\u000a      susceptible to creep degradation (for example reheat cracking and creep\u000d\u000a      crack growth) in the presence of residual stresses.\u000d\u000a    In 2004 British Energy funded our `Boiler Spines Residual Stress\u000d\u000a      Measurement Programme', a five-year research project to quantify residual\u000d\u000a      stresses using neutron diffraction and the contour method, and measure\u000d\u000a      spatially resolved weld properties using digital image correlation, on\u000d\u000a      carefully designed benchmark welds and mock-ups of complex nuclear plant\u000d\u000a      welds. This work has had a direct impact on life-extensions of nuclear\u000d\u000a      plant in the UK [5.3]. Our results were used by British Energy to develop\u000d\u000a      and validate the use of more realistic heat source and material hardening\u000d\u000a      models in weld residual stress simulations [3.5], to characterise the\u000d\u000a      nature of residual stress concentrations at weld repairs [5.4] and to\u000d\u000a      validate predicted creep relaxation of residual stresses. The outcomes of\u000d\u000a      this research have mitigated uncertainty associated with the development\u000d\u000a      of reheat cracking: `The new understanding of weld repairs and refined\u000d\u000a        life analysis methods, underpinned by the OU measurements, has allowed\u000d\u000a        the lives of Hartlepool and Heysham 1 AGR power stations to be extended\u000d\u000a        to 300,000 hours, rather than the previous restriction of 175,000 hours\u000d\u000a        caused by uncertainty about creep damage to weld repairs in the main\u000d\u000a        boiler support structures. The previous restriction would have required\u000d\u000a        the reactors to close early. With each reactor generating around &#163;700k\u000d\u000a        of electricity per day, these life extensions represent a major\u000d\u000a        contribution to the UK economy, on jobs and on security of electricity\u000d\u000a        supply. It also deferred the need for decommissioning and replacement of\u000d\u000a        two nuclear power stations at a cost of several billion pounds each'\u000d\u000a      [5.1]. In aggregate the economic impact of lifetime extensions for the\u000d\u000a      Hartlepool and Heysham 1 twin-reactor power stations, from 2011 to 2019,\u000d\u000a      amounts to electricity generation worth over &#163;8 billion.\u000d\u000a    The application and impact of our research has continued through\u000d\u000a      characterising residual stresses in dissimilar metal welds for pressurized\u000d\u000a      water reactors in Japan and France, and on a critical component in a\u000d\u000a      reactor in Australia that was rendered barely usable due to a water leak,\u000d\u000a      until a repair was justified. `Our collaborative measurements with the\u000d\u000a        Open University team to validate the FEA [finite element analysis] model\u000d\u000a        of the reflector leak was a critical input to the process that\u000d\u000a        identified the successful reactor repair method.

In 2008 a consortium comprising these organisations and the\u000d\u000a      UoA was formed1 with the express purpose to put the UK in an\u000d\u000a      extremely strong bidding position for known future millimetre wave\u000d\u000a      radiometry programmes through engagement with a series of carefully\u000d\u000a      selected projects.

Since 2008 we have developed a\u000d\u000a      variety of world leading patented FSS devices, European Patent EP1 861 896\u000d\u000a      B1, 2010, US patent US 7982 686 B2, 2011, based on advanced micromachined\u000d\u000a      fabrication techniques. Consequently the UoA is the current main supplier\u000d\u000a      of FSS to ESA. Working in partnership with RAL Space (2003-2008), QUB has\u000d\u000a      supplied prototype micromachined frequency selective filters: quartz based\u000d\u000a      FSS (2003); and improved air-spaced FSS (2008).\u000d\u000a    Several of these FSS have been used in PREMIER-Ex (Kiruna, Sweden 2010)\u000d\u000a      and ESSenCe (Kiruna, Sweden 2011) scientific space instrumentation\u000d\u000a      programmes resulting in two-to three-fold improvements in sensitivity in\u000d\u000a      all observing channels. The higher-quality spectra obtained in these\u000d\u000a      Swedish campaigns has resulted in more accurate retrieval of atmospheric\u000d\u000a      constituent profiles. Another mission currently employing patented\u000d\u000a      technology is the MARSCHALS radiometer.

Between 1996 and 2005, 220,000\u000d\u000a      people were killed by weather related disasters, down from 2.6m in the\u000d\u000a      period 1956 to 1965. This reduction is due, in part, to increasingly\u000d\u000a      accurate early weather warnings. Improved understanding of climatic\u000d\u000a      processes requires satellite instruments to monitor the changes and\u000d\u000a      provide a health check on the environment. European mandatory programmes\u000d\u000a      have been initiated to provide, for the first time, detailed observations\u000d\u000a      for climate monitoring. The core sensing instrument deployed for this\u000d\u000a      purpose is the radiometer.\u000d\u000a    Within the radiometer it is necessary to separate naturally occurring\u000d\u000a      electromagnetic molecular emissions in the sub-millimetre range,\u000d\u000a      250GHz-850GHz, by frequency. This frequency range encompasses many of the\u000d\u000a      natural resonances associated with green house gases. These emissions are\u000d\u000a      extremely weak thus high receiver sensitivity is required. The key to the\u000d\u000a      success of these Earth observation missions is predicated on frequency\u000d\u000a      selective surface (FSS) filters which exhibit ultra-low insertion loss. In\u000d\u000a      2000 when missions for 2020 and beyond were being planned it was\u000d\u000a      recognised by the European Space Agency, ESA, that all relevant existing\u000d\u000a      filter technologies could not achieve the system level insertion loss\u000d\u000a      requirement. Therefore there was an urgent requirement to address this gap\u000d\u000a      in technology.\u000d\u000a    QUB were invited by ESA to undertake research to minimise mission risk\u000d\u000a      through the creation of new advanced FSS technologies. Since 2000 to 2013\u000d\u000a      supported by EPSRC, ESA, RAL, Centre for Earth Observation\u000d\u000a      Instrumentation, new modelling, microelectronics fabrication and metrology\u000d\u000a      techniques were developed in order to produce a new class of substrateless\u000d\u000a      FSS which resulting in the core research [1-3] underpinning this case\u000d\u000a      study. The span of the work ranged from, technology concept formulated\u000d\u000a      (2003), to system prototype demonstration in an operational environment\u000d\u000a      (2012), to actual system, (2013).\u000d\u000a    The core underlying research necessary for this progression was as\u000d\u000a      follows. In [1] we described an advanced micromachining technique that was\u000d\u000a      used to create a multilayer freestanding FSS for single sideband filtering\u000d\u000a      in a space borne radiometer. The work demonstrated that the structure\u000d\u000a      exhibited significantly lower insertion and reflection losses than a\u000d\u000a      conventional dielectric backed FSS, and, moreover, is structurally more\u000d\u000a      robust hence better able to survive the forces of a launch vehicle. In [2]\u000d\u000a      we described the electromagnetic design, fabrication and measurement of\u000d\u000a      the first ever ultra-low loss space qualified frequency selective\u000d\u000a      filter. This gave instrument designers, for the first time, the ability to\u000d\u000a      detect vertical and horizontally polarised sub-mm wavelength signals\u000d\u000a      simultaneously, thereby opening the possibility for radically simplified\u000d\u000a      radiometer architecture development. These FSS were fabricated in the\u000d\u000a      UoA13 Advanced Microsystems Centre, using specially developed precision\u000d\u000a      micromachining techniques as described in [3], and have been successfully\u000d\u000a      passed rigorous mechanical and thermal analysis, testing by the space\u000d\u000a      industry as well as being approved for patent grant, [4].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38442","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The research described facilitated major QUB led UK-China collaborations\u000d      funded through (a) the EPSRC Interact Scheme (2005-2006) and (b) the RCUK\u000d      UK-China Science Bridge project (2009-2012).

This has resulted in important advances ranging from the\u000d      control of individual units to whole system and networked control. A key\u000d      aspect has been the use of neural network based methods. These yield new\u000d      and much less complex models than previously available with proven high\u000d      effectiveness in control environments that operate over a wide range of\u000d      system conditions.\u000d    Initial research GR\/K37161\/01 (1995-98) led to new modelling and\u000d      identification methods and associated algorithms for use in processes\u000d      where the underlying dynamics are either too complicated to build a\u000d      white-box model or where process knowledge is either unknown or partially\u000d      known. Subsequent research GR\/S85191\/01 (2004-07), investigated the use of\u000d      neural network methods and resulted in very important advances in a new\u000d      neural modelling approach based on the use of genetic algorithms for use\u000d      in non-linear dynamic systems. Here salient non-linear basis functions are\u000d      extracted, using first principle laws, and used as the basic building\u000d      blocks to optimally construct appropriate neural network models. These\u000d      have a simple structure and produce excellent prediction performance and\u000d      good interpretability [1, 2].\u000d    A major challenge is the selection of a small basis function subset from\u000d      a large candidate pool. However a major breakthrough was made by\u000d      integrating the forward and backward selection using one integrated\u000d      framework. Computational requirements significantly reduce by the\u000d      repetitive application of least squares operations involving matrix\u000d      inversion. This led to enhanced model performance and greater numerical\u000d      efficiency [3] as compared with previous orthogonal least squares methods.\u000d      Application to pollutant emission prediction and control in thermal power\u000d      plants was demonstrated [4] though collaboration with the British Coal\u000d      Utilisation Research Association, E.ON UK Power Technology Ltd.\u000d      Politecnico di Milano and the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station\u000d      Automation Technology.\u000d    Parallel research on whole system control led to other important advances\u000d      with Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) theory being applied\u000d      to non-linear dynamical process monitoring [5]. This led to new MSPC\u000d      monitoring software tools that were subsequently developed commercially.\u000d      An important related challenge is the control of large scale systems where\u000d      units are geographically distributed and connected via various\u000d      communication networks. Research in this area EP\/F00477X\/1 resulted in new\u000d      wireless network control technologies and a new and verified Simulink\u000d      co-simulation tool for the IEEE 801.11 protocol. This uses a novel\u000d      approach to adapt sampling interval based on an 'a priori', static\u000d      sampling policy and assures control stability &#8212; in a mean square sense &#8212;\u000d      by using discrete-time Markov jump linear system theory. In addition, a\u000d      new inverse Gaussian model for the statistical distribution of network\u000d      induced delays was created [6].\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38443","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    From November 2007 the project was subject to technology transfer for\u000a      implementation by\u000a      Caterpillar Electric Power Division (EPD) in association with the UoA.

Primarily this is because,\u000a      while recent advances in\u000a      engine technology have seen the power developed from, for example, a\u000a      9-litre engine, increase\u000a      from 200kW to about 300KW, paradoxically, there is a decline in load\u000a      acceptance. The load\u000a      acceptance capability of gen-set packages is typically of the order of\u000a      only 40% of the steady-state\u000a      rating. This means that owners of a 1 MW site must typically purchase a\u000a      2.5MW gen-set to ensure\u000a      adequate load acceptance capability and this in turn leads to operational\u000a      inefficiencies and\u000a      proportionally higher emissions. The key benefit of the UoA's novel\u000a      advanced non-linear control\u000a      system is that load acceptance has been raised to approximately 70%. This\u000a      negates the necessity\u000a      to significantly oversize gen-sets simply to meet initial load acceptance\u000a      requirements. Hence, the\u000a      size of gen-set required is reduced, as is fuel consumption, resulting in\u000a      lower gaseous and\u000a      particulate emissions, as well as lower operating costs.\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    The first of these projects made extensive use of the UoA world class\u000a      gen-set test facility and\u000a      depended heavily on UoA expertise2.

In 1996\u000a      Emerson formed a joint\u000a      venture with Caterpillar Inc. www.cat.com\/\u000a      which acquired it in 1999.\u000a    Underpinning research commenced with an appraisal of traditional gen-set\u000a      control systems and the\u000a      interactions of these with the individual items of non-linear plant being\u000a      controlled. This highlighted\u000a      that the use of linear control systems (generally fixed gain PID) are not\u000a      best suited to highly non-\u000a      linear plant, such as that found on a gen-set. In addition, a number of\u000a      situations were identified\u000a      where the lack of communication between the individual control systems, in\u000a      particular engine\u000a      governor and alternator automatic voltage regulator, AVR, resulted in\u000a      sub-optimal overall gen-set\u000a      performance. Of particular concern is the instance of initial load\u000a      acceptance of a gen-set in a\u000a      standby or mains failure application. Load acceptance is the ability of\u000a      the generator to deliver\u000a      power when it is first switched on following an interruption in the\u000a      electrical utility supply. Here the\u000a      gen-set is required at operational capacity within a few tens of seconds.\u000a      This is problematical since\u000a      an internal combustion engine has impaired capability to deliver its rated\u000a      output until it has reached\u000a      normal operating temperature.\u000a    To address this problem the research undertaken first deployed a digital\u000a      excitation controller to\u000a      replace the analogue AVR in the alternator. This controller employed fuzzy\u000a      logic as a control\u000a      technology better suited to the deterministic control of highly non-linear\u000a      plant across a range of\u000a      differing operating conditions. Second, fuzzy logic was used to implement\u000a      a digital engine\u000a      governor again resulting in better performance across the complete\u000a      operating range than offered\u000a      by traditional or existing techniques. It was found that when the governor\u000a      and an enhanced AVR\u000a      operated in a co-ordinated manner sharing information that improvements in\u000a      delivered power\u000a      quality was achieved across the entire operating range and significant\u000a      improvements could be\u000a      readily achieved in a number of more challenging operating conditions. In\u000a      the case of the initial\u000a      load acceptance, for example, this can be improved from the 40% of rating\u000a      achieved with\u000a      traditional control to 70% by application of the co-ordinated or\u000a      integrated, fuzzy logic approach\u000a      developed, [1, 2].\u000a    To aid control system design, modelling of plant was undertaken, [3], and\u000a      validation and initial\u000a      implementation was on performed on state of the art plant both at Queen's\u000a      University and at a\u000a      number of international Caterpillar test facilities, patent protection was\u000a      also conducted [4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38444","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described led to the founding by McCanny (then CTO) of\u000a      Amphion Semiconductor\u000a      Ltd. (originally Integrated Silicon Systems Ltd). Amphion rapidly became a\u000a      world leader in the\u000a      licensing of semiconductor IP (SIP) for Digital Communications and Digital\u000a      Video applications.\u000a      Amphion raised over $15M (1999, 2000, and 2002) in a series of\u000a      venture-funded rounds led by\u000a      APAX partners, London. Its workforce grew to around 50 people, including\u000a      numerous PhDs\u000a      recruited from the UoA's research labs1. One of these, Dr Yi\u000a      Hu, went on to become Amphion's\u000a      Chief Silicon Architect\/Chief Technologist. The company's major customers\u000a      included Intel,\u000a      Toshiba, Microsoft, Broadcom, Hitachi, Panasonic, NEC, Sony, Alcatel,\u000a      Ericson, Siemens and\u000a      Mitsubishi. It also built strong strategic partnerships with FPGA\u000a      companies Xilinx and Altera.\u000a    Amphion's SIP Platforms included Wireless LAN baseband processors (IEEE\u000a      802.11A,\u000a      HIPERLAN) and DVB subsystems for Cable, Satellite and Terrestrial DTV. Its\u000a      video and imaging\u000a      cores covered encoding and decoding solutions for JPEG, JPEG2000, MPEG2,\u000a      MPEG4 and\u000a      H.264. Lower level cores included 2D Wavelet Processors, parameterisable\u000a      FFTs, FIR and IIR\u000a      filters and Reed-Solomon and Viterbi decoders for Digital Video Broadcast2.\u000a      These were available\u000a      for both ASIC and FPGA implementations and exhibited performance levels\u000a      which in terms of gate\u000a      count and power consumption were - and continue to be - world\u000a      state-of-the-art, as they are\u000a      migrated onto new generations of fabrication technologies.\u000a    Amphion was acquired by Conexant Inc in 2004 for $25M. Subsequently,\u000a      Conexant's STB\u000a      operations (including its Amphion division) were acquired by NXP\u000a      Semiconductors (Phillips) in April\u000a      2008 NXPAmphion.\u000a      In February 2010, Trident Microsystems signed an agreement to acquire\u000a      NXP's television and STB business lines with NXP taking shares\u000a      in this new venture NXPTrident.\u000a      Subsequently another STB SoC company, Entropic Communications Inc., (EntropicTrident)\u000a      acquired the STB assets from Trident Microsystems, including the\u000a      Belfast-based (former Amphion)\u000a      video codec team.\u000a    The impact of this research and the technology includes the following3:\u000a    \u000a      Since Amphion's acquisition, the same core team has produced the video\u000a        codec IP for\u000a        every STB and DTV SoC produced by each of the company's subsequent\u000a        owners.

O'Neill is now a Professor in\u000a        the UoA.\u000a    Time period, 1993-2004\u000a    By the early nineties it was possible to fabricate silicon chips with\u000a      hundreds of millions of\u000a      transistors. This coincided with an insatiable demand for real-time\u000a      computational rates driven by\u000a      emerging applications such as multi-media systems and HDTV. This created a\u000a      number of major\u000a      challenges. The first was to create novel silicon architectures that could\u000a      meet the very demanding\u000a      real-time computational rates required in a highly cost effective manner\u000a      (i.e. small silicon footprint\u000a      and low power dissipation). Far beyond the capabilities of then available\u000a      microprocessor solutions.\u000a      The second was to address the challenges of correctly designing chips of\u000a      this complexity. This led\u000a      to a number of inter-related research programmes, an important outcome of\u000a      which was the\u000a      creation of new silicon computational architectures and methods for the\u000a      design of complex signal\u000a      and video processing chips. These exploited the inherently regular\u000a      architectures that typify\u000a      datapaths for implementing DSP functions such as filters, transforms,\u000a      convolutional decoders etc.\u000a      and built on our pioneering research in this field (partly summarised in\u000a      [1]). A key observation was\u000a      to note that, whilst new DSP\/video processing algorithms are continually\u000a      being created, these\u000a      typically decompose into a finite set of sub-computations such as FFTs,\u000a      DCTs, Wavelet\u000a      transforms, digital filters etc., albeit with different transform sizes,\u000a      filter lengths, word lengths and\u000a      data flows. This led to the creation of libraries of parameterised\u000a      architectural templates captured in\u000a      the VHDL hardware description language [2].\u000a    Initially this was done for building blocks such as fixed and floating\u000a      point arithmetic processors.\u000a      These were then used to build many different and parameterisable variants\u000a      of circuits for\u000a      implementing FIR filters, FFT and DCT processors etc. and in turn to\u000a      create more complex\u000a      systems, examples being families of video decoders and encoders for\u000a      standards such as H.264,\u000a      MPEG4 and MPEG2, JPEG2000 and JPEG. The use of scripts allowed highly\u000a      optimised,\u000a      synthesisable designs to be created at the lower levels. This hierarchical\u000a      approach ensured\u000a      efficiencies were maintained through higher levels of complexity. Thus,\u000a      very highly competitive chip\u000a      designs &#8212; measured in terms of performance, gate count and power\u000a      dissipation- could be, and\u000a      were created in a fraction of the time previously thought possible\u000a      &#8212; days and weeks rather than\u000a      months and years [2-5] which, using design synthesis methods, could be\u000a      mapped directly onto\u000a      more advanced silicon fabrication processes as these emerged. Related\u000a      research resulted in novel\u000a      computational methods and architectures [6] for variable block size motion\u000a      estimation - extensively\u000a      used in modern video standards. This showed how the 41 sub-block motion\u000a      vectors typically\u000a      required can be computed in the same number of clock cycles as were needed\u000a      previously for one\u000a      motion vector.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38579","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The classification techniques developed at Reading [5-8] became essential\u000a      components of the Eprocurement system, SpendInsight, which was launched in\u000a      February 2010 by @UK plc. The system uses artificial intelligence\u000a      techniques to enable e-procurers to analyse their purchases and identify\u000a      potentially significant savings. @UK plc subsequently launched the\u000a      GreenInsight system, which again incorporated the artificial intelligence\u000a      techniques developed by Reading. GreenInsight estimates the carbon\u000a      footprint of products and procurement activities in order to help\u000a      businesses develop environmentally friendly procurement policies.\u000a    @UK PLC benefits from the launch of SpendInsight and GreenInsight\u000a    SpendInsight immediately increased @UK plc's analysing capacity; within\u000a      the first two months of launching the SpendInsight website, @UK plc had\u000a      analysed over &#163;35 billion in spend, which was an increase from the &#163;16\u000a      billion it had analysed the previous year [a].\u000a\u0009  SpendInsight also\u000a      significantly improved @UK plc's efficiency, producing results faster, at\u000a      less cost and with better results than previous systems. @UK plc was\u000a      working with the NHS London Procurement Partnership (LPP) and using the\u000a      leading spend analysis system at the time, they had taken 2 years to\u000a      analyse less than 25% of all of London's spend, costing around &#163;500,000\u000a      [a]. In 2010, they implemented SpendInsight and in 6 months had analysed\u000a      London's entire spend, with better results, for significantly less cost\u000a      [a].\u000a    On September 4th, 2013, @UK plc announced that they had agreed\u000a      a &#163;3.4 million conditional licensing agreement with Tungsten Corporation\u000a      plc for SpendInsight [b].Tungsten will market the software to its 122\u000a      global clients as TungstenAnalytics and @UK will receive up front\u000a      establishment fees and installation costs of around half a million pounds\u000a      [b].\u000a\u0009The @UK Chairman has stated that; \"SpendInsight and GreenInsight have\u000a      revolutionised our business. SpendInsight is recognised as still being\u000a      globally unique 3 years after development, and we just won a &#163; 3.4m\u000a      contract where the customer is licencing SpendInsight. This is 1.5x our\u000a      current turnover. Additionally the SpendInsight capablity has been a major\u000a      factor in our relationship with Visa and the global roll out of our\u000a      marketplace technology where SpendInsight delivers an instant business\u000a      case for buying organisations.\" [c]\u000a    Taxpayers and NHS benefit from savings identified through SpendInsight\u000a    SpendInsight was used to identify considerable savings for the NHS London\u000a      Procurement Partnership (LPP) - both soft process savings and hard\u000a      cashable savings - and provided impetus to standardise and centralise\u000a      their e-procurement across the Trusts' back office. SpendInsight also\u000a      identified which were the key suppliers and key commodities, a process\u000a      that had the effect of driving both user and supplier acceptance of the\u000a      change to e-procurement.\u000a\u0009Over the course of the project the researchers\u000a      obtained and processed NHS procurement data for 73 NHS trusts in the UK,\u000a      the majority centred in London. The SpendInsight system was used to\u000a      analyse the purchase orders, invoices and contracts of the different\u000a      organisations, identify equivalent purchases and benchmark the best\u000a      possible prices for each product, and identify savings.\u000a    The analysis found that significant savings could be made within the NHS\u000a      with relatively simple changes in procurement behaviour. For example, the\u000a      amalgamation of small ad-hoc orders into larger, less frequent orders\u000a      could standardise product choices and facilitate lower-costs for\u000a      guaranteed high-volume deals. One NHS Trust saved &#163;320,000 in 2011 alone\u000a      by switching to one supplier of examination gloves and ordering 2 choices\u000a      of glove rather than 20 [d].\u000a    @UK PLC provided analysis services to the National Audit Office (NAO) to\u000a      assist them in the preparation of their 2011 report on the procurement of\u000a      consumables by NHS hospital trusts. The National Audit Office (NAO)\u000a      included @UK plc's SpendInsight analysis in their 2011 analysis of the NHS\u000a      Trust's procurement and spending on consumables [e]. The NAO concluded\u000a      that if the procurement system was utilised across all NHS Trusts in\u000a      England, they could \"make overall savings of at least &#163;500 million, around\u000a      10% of the total NHS consumables expenditure of &#163;4.6 billion\" [c].\u000a    After the initial analysis using SpendInsight in 2012, the Royal\u000a      Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust decided to continue using the system to\u000a      analyse their quarterly spend for 2013. The Principal Procurement Manager\u000a      stated that \"with an addressable spend of &#163; 60 million, to be able to save\u000a      even one percent of that is a benefit\".

The nature of e-procurement data (large\u000a      quantities, heterogeneous, sparse, unstructured, distributed and noisy)\u000a      makes it challenging to apply existing state of the art management\u000a      techniques.\u000a    In 2006, three linked Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) projects were\u000a      started to create innovative solutions to the challenges of e-procurement\u000a      data; the solutions needed to be cost effective and commercially viable.\u000a      Two of these were with the University of Reading, while the third took\u000a      place at Goldsmith's, University of London. The company @UK plc, a leading\u000a      e-commerce marketplace provider, giving support to over 1 million\u000a      businesses worldwide, was the industry partner on all three KTP projects.\u000a      The University of Reading was the knowledge base partner for two of the\u000a      KTP projects which focused on innovative approaches to data classification\u000a      and related artificial intelligence techniques; one of these projects\u000a      concentrated on classification of products, while the other dealt with\u000a      ranking web pages on the basis of textual search, as well as finding\u000a      property structure from product descriptions based on natural language.\u000a      Goldsmith's was the knowledge base partner on the third KTP project, which\u000a      concentrated on systematically spidering web pages to gather relevant\u000a      product information from them. These linked projects ran for three years\u000a      from 2006 to 2009.\u000a    Classification of data using artificial intelligence\u000a    The University of Reading team was comprised of: Dr Richard Mitchell,\u000a      Associate Professor (2013-present) previously Senior Lecturer\u000a      (1994-2013); Slawomir Nasuto, Professor of Cybernetics (2012-present),\u000a      previously Reader (2007-2012); Dr Virginie Ruiz, Associate Professor\u000a      (2013-present), previously Senior Lecturer (2004-2013); and Victor\u000a      Becerra, Professor of Automatic Control (2012-present), previously Reader\u000a      (2005-2013).\u000a    The Reading team brought decades of experience in classifying challenging\u000a      data to the partnership with @UK plc. When data are collected by a spider\u000a      &#8212; a program that \"crawls\" through the web looking for relevant data in\u000a      response to a query about, for example, a product &#8212; they need to be\u000a      analysed to determine the category to which the product belongs; this\u000a      classification can then be used to find equivalent products from different\u000a      suppliers. The products also need to be ranked to determine which are most\u000a      important or relevant to the search request. The Reading team have been\u000a      developing and applying methods for classifying data using various\u000a      artificial intelligence approaches, including neural networks [1,2,8],\u000a      evolutionary computing, swarm intelligence, adaptive signal processing,\u000a      and machine learning [1,2]. The team have developed and applied these\u000a      methods in response to challenges faced in a diversity of disciplines,\u000a      including health [2, 7 &amp; 8] and economics [1].\u000a    There are several challenges with real world text classification,\u000a      including poor class structure, overlapping classes and blurred boundaries\u000a      between categories. Moreover, training data pooled from multiple sources\u000a      tend to be inconsistent and contain erroneous labelling, leading to poor\u000a      performance of standard text classifiers. In 2010, the Reading team looked\u000a      at how health service products were classified to specialised procurement\u000a      classes in order to examine and quantify the extent of these problems [3].\u000a      They presented a novel method to analyse the labelled data by selectively\u000a      merging classes where there was not enough information for the classifier\u000a      to distinguish them. Additional contributions made through the research\u000a      that lead to SpendInsight include: ensuring that the data pre-processing\u000a      and classification methods were scalable so that they were able to process\u000a      procurement data from large organisations (`big data') in reasonable time;\u000a      the development of a sophisticated rule engine for de-duplication [3],\u000a      which is employed to automatically detect and eliminate duplicate items\u000a      from the procurement data; and finally the development of methods for\u000a      automatic detection of attribute data in textual descriptions of products\u000a      [6]\u000a    This research led to the development of an intelligent spend analysis\u000a      system known as SpendInsight which became a key component in the @UK plc\u000a      e-procurement and e-marketplace platform.\u000a    Methods to estimate environmental cost\u000a    With individual products classified through SpendInsight, the Reading\u000a      researchers then developed methods to estimate the environmental cost of\u000a      the product by mapping it to the ethical and environmental information\u000a      held for millions of products by the Centre for Sustainability Accounting.\u000a      The resultant system, GreenInsight, was launched in 2010 and is used by\u000a      procurers to assess the carbon footprint of their purchases; they can now\u000a      compare the cheapest price economically and environmentally, and thus\u000a      quantify the cost of `being green'.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38580","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Infrared Multilayer Laboratory is recognised as a world leading\u000d\u000a      facility in the field of optical thin-film interference coatings for Space\u000d\u000a      and Astronomy. The beneficiaries from this research flow through to the\u000d\u000a      collective public user community as satellite data for improved weather\u000d\u000a      forecasting, atmospheric and climate research, and observations of the\u000d\u000a      universe through infrared astronomy. The following examples highlight the\u000d\u000a      impact of this research to three differing sectors of the remote-sensing\u000d\u000a      community.\u000d\u000a    Earth Observation\u000d\u000a      The High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) is an infrared\u000d\u000a      instrument for atmospheric monitoring of global temperature and trace\u000d\u000a      constituents from the upper troposphere into the mesosphere. The\u000d\u000a      instrument operates with 42 precision narrow-band interference filters\u000d\u000a      integrated into a focal plane detector arrays to provide simultaneous\u000d\u000a      multi-channel observations of a target scene at discrete wavelengths\u000d\u000a      across the thermal waveband. Launched on the NASA Aura spacecraft in a\u000d\u000a      polar orbit in 2004, the instrument provides an unprecedented wealth of\u000d\u000a      atmospheric information with enhanced resolution relative to earlier\u000d\u000a      instruments. HIRDLS can monitor rapid vertical changes in temperature and\u000d\u000a      composition previously unobserved on a global basis and provides\u000d\u000a      atmospheric measurements over virtually every point on the Earth surface\u000d\u000a      in a repeatable pattern, permitting observation of atmospheric phenomena\u000d\u000a      changes in the same geographic locations throughout the lifetime of the\u000d\u000a      mission. The fine spatial and spectral resolution has resulted in ongoing\u000d\u000a      research discoveries and refinements in global atmospheric circulation\u000d\u000a      models, including; unique measurements of Cirrus cloud distribution\u000d\u000a      mapping in the upper troposphere (2010), equatorial wave structure\u000d\u000a      propagation (2011), gravity wave momentum fluxes in polar and monsoon\u000d\u000a      regions (2011), and stratosphere-troposphere intrusions resulting from low\u000d\u000a      ozone concentrations (2011).\u000d\u000a    Planetary Reconnaissance\u000d\u000a      The Diviner radiometer experiment on the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter\u000d\u000a      uses infrared filters to investigate the thermal radiation, mineralogical\u000d\u000a      composition and structure of the lunar environment to gather data as a\u000d\u000a      prelude to future human exploration of the Moon. High precision narrow\u000d\u000a      bandpass filters manufactured by IML are used to identify possible\u000d\u000a      locations of ice formation, map mineralogical rock compositions and lunar\u000d\u000a      soils. The filters provided crucial measurements during the Lunar LCROSS\u000d\u000a      impact mission in 2009, witnessing energy dissipation and cooling during a\u000d\u000a      planetary impact. The impact shows strong evidence of trapped volatile\u000d\u000a      chemical compounds that originate from primitive outer solar system\u000d\u000a      bodies. Diviner has discovered further cold traps in the Moon's south\u000d\u000a      polar region where sub-surface temperatures are cold enough to cold-trap\u000d\u000a      water ice and other volatile species. Moon \"red spot\" regions were\u000d\u000a      discovered to exhibit high Silicic composition, quartz, silica-rich glass,\u000d\u000a      alkali feldspar and pyroclastic FeO deposits, providing evidence that the\u000d\u000a      Moon is a complex body that has experienced a diverse set of igneous\u000d\u000a      processes.\u000d\u000a    Infrared filters designed and manufactured by IML for the Mars Climate\u000d\u000a      Sounder experiment on the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter were deployed\u000d\u000a      to observe the temperature, pressure, humidity and dust content of the\u000d\u000a      Martian atmosphere. The measurements obtained through these filters are\u000d\u000a      assembled into daily global maps to show how the Martian weather\u000d\u000a      circulates and varies over time. Discoveries from this instrument have\u000d\u000a      provided copious information about ancient environments, ice-age scale\u000d\u000a      climate cycles and present-day atmospheric changes. Carbon dioxide\u000d\u000a      snowfalls were also detected from south polar clouds, making Mars the only\u000d\u000a      body in the solar system to exhibit this strange weather phenomenon, and\u000d\u000a      tracking of regional dust storms in the lower atmosphere of the red\u000d\u000a      planet.\u000d\u000a    Ground-based Astronomy\u000d\u000a      Cooled astronomical filters were developed for ground-based astronomy\u000d\u000a      under the auspices of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) VISible\u000d\u000a      InfraRed Instrument (VISIR) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chile.

The successful\u000d\u000a      manufacture of these complex filters has enabled scientists to investigate\u000d\u000a      astronomical phenomena not previously attainable. The range of infrared\u000d\u000a      filters distributed throughout the astronomical community has resulted in\u000d\u000a      a vast collection of astrophysical discoveries ranging from; particulate\u000d\u000a      interstellar and circumstellar hot dust properties, planetary gas\u000d\u000a      emissions, star and planet forming nuclei, and structure of luminous\u000d\u000a      infrared galaxies.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Thin-film optical filter research at the University of Reading is a\u000d\u000a      unique and enabling technology that permits astronomers and meteorologists\u000d\u000a      to gather data leading to increased understanding of atmospheric and\u000d\u000a      astrophysical phenomena.

The expertise and specialisation\u000d\u000a      of the laboratory is founded on the physics of optical thin-film\u000d\u000a      interference theory applied to the custom manufacture and spaceflight\u000d\u000a      qualification of high performance coatings in the mid-infrared region,\u000d\u000a      most often for use at cryogenic temperatures. This research has involved\u000d\u000a      adapting to new challenges of improvements in detection technologies,\u000d\u000a      complex optical design paths, high resolution accuracy, mechanical\u000d\u000a      durability, long operational lifetimes, and bespoke shapes and sizes of\u000d\u000a      optics in the latest generation of advanced spaceflight instrumentation.\u000d\u000a    This research area extends the principals of thin-film design and\u000d\u000a      manufacturing methods based on Hawkins PhD thesis that describes the\u000d\u000a      characterisation and application of absorptive and dispersive mechanisms\u000d\u000a      to infrared materials for predictive multilayer filter design modelling.\u000d\u000a      The laboratory has developed a unique and specialist infrared deposition\u000d\u000a      technology utilising the optical and semiconductor properties of special\u000d\u000a      dielectric materials [1] to fabricate custom-made optical\u000d\u000a      components.\u000d\u000a    Research conducted by Hawkins developed the first integrated spectral\u000d\u000a      systems model that was used to simulate the throughput performance and\u000d\u000a      derive filter specification requirements using the entire optical\u000d\u000a      instrument response [2]. Funded by the NERC, the IML group\u000d\u000a      were CoIs with responsibility for the spectral design, fabrication and\u000d\u000a      performance verification of the HIRDLS optical layout [3].\u000d\u000a      This involved optimising and tailoring thin-film multilayer designs to\u000d\u000a      maximize the total system performance efficiency. Research from this\u000d\u000a      instrument also demonstrated the first successful fabrication and\u000d\u000a      deployment of precision miniature infrared filters into a focal plane\u000d\u000a      detector array for use in a spaceflight instrument. The development of\u000d\u000a      these miniature filters enabled observations of different atmospheric\u000d\u000a      trace gas species from the same target scene to be measured\u000d\u000a      simultaneously, compared to previous discrete channels. These innovations\u000d\u000a      have been adopted for other planetary reconnaissance missions to\u000d\u000a      investigate the atmosphere and chemistry of Mars [4] and the\u000d\u000a      Moon [5].\u000d\u000a    Further experimental research and knowledge gained from characterising\u000d\u000a      the optical and mechanical properties of infrared materials, together with\u000d\u000a      vacuum-deposited thin-film engineering and system design modelling was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in deploying a new generation of cooled filters for infrared\u000d\u000a      astronomy [6]. This research involved the development of\u000d\u000a      improved, mechanically robust, stress-free infrared coatings using\u000d\u000a      environmentally compliant replacements of previous toxic, hygroscopic and\u000d\u000a      radioactive materials. Development of these filters subsequently provided\u000d\u000a      a consortium of international astronomy institutes with the capability to\u000d\u000a      observe and correlate astrophysical phenomena at new and critical\u000d\u000a      wavelengths.\u000d\u000a    Dr Gary Hawkins joined the Unit in 1985.

The Reading team used this implant, together with technology\u000a      developed at the Unit [1] (operational system, signal processing,\u000a      communications), to achieve the first human implant of BrainGate. The\u000a      implant was fired into the median nerves of Professor Warwick's left arm\u000a      on March 14th 2002 in a 2 hour operation. The implant was\u000a      connected to a processing unit to allow stimulation of nerve fibers to\u000a      artificially generate sensation perceivable by the subject and recording\u000a      of local nerve activity to form control commands for wirelessly connected\u000a      devices.\u000a    During evaluation of the implant system the nervous system of Professor\u000a      Warwick was connected onto the internet in Columbia\u000a        University, New York, enabling a robot arm in the University of\u000a      Reading to use Professor Warwick' neural signals to mimic his hand\u000a      movements, while allowing him to perceive what the robot touched from\u000a      sensors in the robot's finger tips [2]. Further studies also demonstrated\u000a      that it was possible to communicate directly between the nervous systems\u000a      of two individuals, the first direct and purely electronic communication\u000a      between the nervous systems of two humans\u000a    Further research, from 2004 to present, with MRC support, used an\u000a      artificial intelligence system connected to the brain via deep embedded\u000a      electrodes to accurately predict the onset of Parkinsonian tremors up to\u000a      20 seconds in advance [3,4]. The electrodes were then used to provide deep\u000a      brain stimulation to counteract these tremors before they took hold. This\u000a      is in direct contrast to traditional deep brain stimulation techniques\u000a      where a continuous stimulation signal is used to control tremors and\u000a      therefore this research is opening up other possible routes to treatment.\u000a      Finally, from 2007 to present, with various EPSRC listed support, we\u000a      cultured a population of approximately 100,000 to 150,000 living neuronal\u000a      cells (rat and human) on a multi-electrode array within a closed loop\u000a      robot body. In this novel set-up the cultured brain cells were connected\u000a      within a robot body [5]. The robot's sensory readings were used to\u000a      stimulate the cell culture and the cell activity was then in turn used to\u000a      change the robot's behaviour &#8212; for example, to control its movement inside\u000a      a small corral. The work demonstrated that cultures of neurons can be used\u000a      to control a robot to avoid obstacles, thereby creating a platform for\u000a      investigating culture plasticity (the capacity for neural pathways to\u000a      change due to feedback) [6].\u000a    These experiments have led to a basic reassessment of how the brain and\u000a      nervous system operate. The work could lead to new therapies to directly\u000a      help those with a disability or neurodegenerative disease such as\u000a      Parkinson's. The work reveals the tantalising, but for some, provocative,\u000a      possibility of being able to change and possibly enhance the basic\u000a      functioning of a brain by linking it directly with technology.\u000a    The research was led by Professor Kevin Warwick who joined the University\u000a      as Professor of Cybernetics in 1988. Professor Nasuto (Reader in\u000a      Cybernetics since 2000, becoming Professor in 2012) and Dr Mark Gasson\u000a      (research staff since 2004) formed part of the team developing this\u000a      technology.

The\u000d\u000a      results of the SubSafe experimental programme have demonstrated\u000d\u000a      (not only to the RN, but to\u000d\u000a      interested senior observers from the Royal Canadian and Australian Navies\u000d\u000a      as well) that SMQ\u000d\u000a      students are likely to benefit significantly from games-based training,\u000d\u000a      even in the absence of\u000d\u000a      submarines alongside, and such training will improve their familiarisation\u000d\u000a      and, thus, their safety\u000d\u000a      awareness when they are eventually exposed to real, complex submarine\u000d\u000a      spaces and systems.\u000d\u000a    UK Adoption\/Impact. As well as the installation of SubSafe\u000d\u000a      into the Waterfront Learning Centre\u000d\u000a      at HM Naval Base, Devonport in April, 2011, the results of the SubSafe\u000d\u000a      programme were influential\u000d\u000a      in the establishment, at HM Naval Base, Faslane, of a new training\u000d\u000a      facility developed by Babcock\u000d\u000a      International for the Astute Class submarine (again in 2011).\u000d\u000a      Feedback from the operators of this\u000d\u000a      facility indicate that, from the first four courses undertaken, all 80\u000d\u000a      students passed the SMQ\u000d\u000a      process first time, and follow-up investigations show that the time taken\u000d\u000a      for subsequent on-the-job\u000d\u000a      (consolidation) training is significantly less than that given to other\u000d\u000a      submarine trainees who have\u000d\u000a      received more conventional forms of training. Although specific financial\u000d\u000a      savings cannot be\u000d\u000a      released due to MoD and commercial sensitivities, the Babcock training\u000d\u000a      team (as emphasised in\u000d\u000a      Letter 1 from the company's Submarine Training Director) believes that 400\u000d\u000a      man weeks per year is\u000d\u000a      being saved as a result of adopting technology-based training as developed\u000d\u000a      during the SubSafe\u000d\u000a      programme. Babcock has put an agreement into effect, enabling the\u000d\u000a      University of Birmingham to\u000d\u000a      provide human factors and simulation consultancy for its future submarine\u000d\u000a      training programmes.\u000d\u000a    Government\/Policy Impact. At a government agency strategic\u000d\u000a      level, and acknowledged at\u000d\u000a      Admiral level, including Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST), the SubSafe\u000d\u000a      programme has also\u000d\u000a      provided inputs into RN policy (Letters 2 and 3). SubSafe has\u000d\u000a      influenced the MoD's Submarine\u000d\u000a      Training &amp; Education Programme, STEP, and the future adoption of\u000d\u000a      simulation and virtual\u000d\u000a      environments to support submarine design and training, including the\u000d\u000a      establishment of a dedicated\u000d\u000a      SUBFLOT (Submarine Flotilla) Team to determine future submarine\u000d\u000a      capabilities. STEP is a\u000d\u000a      combined MoD, RN and industry team set up to optimise training and\u000d\u000a      education to sustain the UK's\u000d\u000a      nuclear defence capability. The STEP Team is also planning to set up a UK\u000d\u000a      Submarine Enterprise\u000d\u000a      Academy, which would be another exploitation path for the SubSafe\u000d\u000a      project. In addition to the\u000d\u000a      STEP development, the University of Birmingham has also been recruited to\u000d\u000a      provide specialist\u000d\u000a      simulation know-how to Dstl, as part of their Future Submarine Command\u000d\u000a      Space R&amp;D Programme.\u000d\u000a    SubSafe was also one of two success stories cited in the 2011 MoD\u000d\u000a      Chief Scientific Advisor's\u000d\u000a      Commendation, presented to Stone in recognition of excellence in defence\u000d\u000a      science and technology\u000d\u000a      (CSA Citation Text). Peter Luff MP, Minister for Defence Equipment,\u000d\u000a      Support and Technology,\u000d\u000a      subsequently wrote to Stone in support of this and commending SubSafe\u000d\u000a      as addressing the\u000d\u000a      \"significant challenge of submariner training\" (Letters 7 and 8).\u000d\u000a    International Impact. The results of the SubSafe\u000d\u000a      programme have also been exploited by\u000d\u000a      international navies to justify developing their own virtual SMQ training\u000d\u000a      packages. Both the Royal\u000d\u000a      Australian and Canadian Navies have acknowledged the important role played\u000d\u000a      by SubSafe in their\u000d\u000a      evolution of similar technologies for their own submarine fleets. Letters\u000d\u000a      4 and 5, for example, from\u000d\u000a      senior training figures in the Royal Australian and Canadian Navies,\u000d\u000a      include comments such as\u000d\u000a      \"The usefulness and practical employment of the SubSafe program was\u000d\u000a      impressive; we will use\u000d\u000a      the experience and information to refine our product, to achieve the\u000d\u000a      knowledge transfer that we\u000d\u000a      seek\"; \"(the) SubSafe virtual submarine project has greatly\u000d\u000a      inspired the Royal Canadian Navy\u000d\u000a      Learning Support Center in pursuing the development of the Canadian\u000d\u000a      Virtual Naval Fleet Project\";\u000d\u000a      and \"The lessons learned from your project provided our personnel with\u000d\u000a      expertise that really\u000d\u000a      facilitated our decision to use PC based virtual environments to support\u000d\u000a      spatial and system\u000d\u000a      awareness training and also greatly oriented our design and development\u000d\u000a      process.\"\u000d\u000a    SubSafe Simulation Re-Use. Another\u000d\u000a      key element in the impact success of SubSafe has been\u000d\u000a      the early attention paid to the design of the 3D media to support rapid\u000d\u000a      re-use for related training\u000d\u000a      and visualisation opportunities. As a result, related industrial impacts\u000d\u000a      have been evident with other\u000d\u000a      future Royal Navy vessel programmes, where early concept designs have\u000d\u000a      exploited the tools\u000d\u000a      developed by the University and lessons learned from the SubSafe\u000d\u000a      programme. These include the\u000d\u000a      Type 26, or Future Surface Combatant (coordinated by the Naval\u000d\u000a      Design Partnership) and\u000d\u000a      Successor, the future submarine (coordinated by BAE Systems). Other\u000d\u000a      safety training\u000d\u000a      demonstration projects based on SubSafe and presented to the Royal\u000d\u000a      Navy have included a\u000d\u000a      disabled submarine rescue simulation and an ergonomics study of the\u000d\u000a      deployment of CO2-absorbing\u000d\u000a      Lithium Hydroxide \"curtains\" within the Forward Escape Compartment. These\u000d\u000a      examples\u000d\u000a      have also provided the Birmingham Research Team with a range of assets,\u000d\u000a      tools and techniques\u000d\u000a      suitable for application in other defence and civilian engineering\u000d\u000a      contexts, such as those mentioned\u000d\u000a      in Section 2.\u000d\u000a    Exploitation &#8212; RN Court Hearing. Another example of\u000d\u000a      effective early design for media re-use\u000d\u000a      and exploitation was the modification of SubSafe to provide a\u000d\u000a      world first animation sequence for\u000d\u000a      legal proceedings at a Coroner's Court of Inquiry in 2009.

The SubSafe project\u000d\u000a      led to the formation and launch, in 2009,\u000d\u000a      of an innovative micro-small-to-medium-sized enterprise, MODUX, to provide\u000d\u000a      3D modelling and\u000d\u000a      simulation support to the University of Birmingham Team (during the\u000d\u000a      transition of the early\u000d\u000a      research output into a more \"productised\" version &#8212; SubSafe 2\u000d\u000a      (Letter 6)).

Secondary aims of the research involved evaluating different\u000d\u000a      interactive techniques for\u000d\u000a      delivering the VR material (\"passive\", or instructor-led, using a data\u000d\u000a      projector, vs. \"active\", allowing\u000d\u000a      each student \"hands-on\" with the simulation via laptops) and to assess\u000d\u000a      students' and instructors'\u000d\u000a      attitudes (and any change in attitudes) regarding the use of novel\u000d\u000a      interactive technologies in RN\u000d\u000a      training contexts. The SubSafe research is also relevant to the\u000d\u000a      training of spatial awareness or\u000d\u000a      health and safety issues for other complex engineering contexts, including\u000d\u000a      land-based and offshore\u000d\u000a      petrochemical and gas plant, nuclear and mining facilities, and civilian\u000d\u000a      maritime transportation.\u000d\u000a    Early Human Factors observations and task analyses supporting the design\u000d\u000a      of the SubSafe VR\u000d\u000a      system and its integration into existing training r&#233;gimes were conducted\u000d\u000a      (a) within the Submarine\u000d\u000a      Qualification (SMQ) classrooms at HM Naval Base at Devonport, (b) onboard\u000d\u000a      Trafalgar Class\u000d\u000a      submarines alongside and (c) at sea with the crew of HMS Tireless\u000d\u000a      (References 1, 4 and 6 in\u000d\u000a      Section 3). Uniquely, SubSafe was the first games-based training\u000d\u000a      system of its kind to receive a\u000d\u000a      thorough experimental evaluation, based on nearly 24 months of\u000d\u000a      investigation using real\u000d\u000a      submarine recruits in real naval classroom and vessel settings.\u000d\u000a      Statistical analyses of knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer data revealed that use of SubSafe during classroom\u000d\u000a      training significantly improves the final\u000d\u000a      \"walk-around\" performance of students (onboard an actual submarine) when\u000d\u000a      compared to that of a\u000d\u000a      control group receiving legacy training techniques (References 3 and 5 in\u000d\u000a      Section 3). No\u000d\u000a      significant differences in onboard spatial awareness were found between\u000d\u000a      passive and active\u000d\u000a      presentations of the simulation. Further experiments have investigated the\u000d\u000a      optimum presentation\u000d\u000a      times for SubSafe, comparing a single exposure of the simulation\u000d\u000a      to SMQ students at the end of\u000d\u000a      their 6-week training r&#233;gime to course-specific exposures during weeks 2\u000d\u000a      to 4 (Reference 5 in\u000d\u000a      Section 3). Significant attitudinal changes were also recorded after\u000d\u000a      exposure to SubSafe, with\u000d\u000a      participants responding positively to the use of games-based simulation in\u000d\u000a      mainstream RN training\u000d\u000a      (References 3 and 5 in Section 3).\u000d\u000a    From an international perspective, SubSafe is a\u000d\u000a      successful example of a games-based training\u000d\u000a      project that has benefited from a detailed academic approach to design and\u000d\u000a      evaluation from the\u000d\u000a      outset.

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) radar\u000a    JLR has been equipping vehicles with ACC as an option since 1999. The\u000a      currently advertised list price for this popular option is &#163;1275.\u000a    ACC capability in both Ford and JLR is built on the underpinning research\u000a      described above. The automotive radar research experience was shared with\u000a      parent company Ford and assisted the design of the production systems for\u000a      both brands by Delphi. These systems are now in full scale\u000a      production.\u000a    Ford, having acquired Jaguar Cars in 1989, formed a World-Wide Radar\u000a      Evaluation Committee in 1998. It visited all major potential automotive\u000a      radar developers and suppliers in the US, Europe and Japan to evaluate\u000a      performance, quality, production time, costs and reliability and to\u000a      establish a suitable production supplier. Hoare was appointed to this\u000a      panel as the sole radar expert and the sole member external to the\u000a      company, by virtue of his expertise built up during research work at\u000a      Birmingham.\u000a    4.1.2. Blind Spot monitor\u000a    This product was launched by Jaguar in 2008. The current list price for\u000a      the option is &#163;460. Initial work was started in 2006 with road trials\u000a      undertaken by Jaguar and Birmingham University in 2007. Research at\u000a      Birmingham resolved deep practical issues, such as the penetration of\u000a      radar signals through the painted bumper (radars are mounted behind the\u000a      bumper material), and the interaction of the signals with the body of the\u000a      vehicle. Birmingham provided expertise in resolving manufacturing issues\u000a      with the supplier of switched beam antennas, and in the performance\u000a      evaluation and vehicle integration.\u000a    4.1.3. Lane Change Merge Aid\u000a    Research has continued and evolved into the development of a long range\u000a      (80m) mm-wave Lane Changing Merge Aid radar system. This rear looking\u000a      radar system measures range, velocity and angle, providing information in\u000a      the blind spot and beyond, to assist a driver when changing lanes and\u000a      merging into traffic. Full development at JLR has led, within the REF\u000a      qualifying period, to prototype systems. Full scale production will begin\u000a      in 2014.\u000a    4.2 Contributions to Technical Standards\u000a    Hoare sat on the EU automotive radar committee setting International\u000a      radio standards to enable mm-wave radars to be operated within radio\u000a      spectrum management regulations, as well as personally reporting at the\u000a      International Telecommunications Union in Geneva. The committee ran for 4\u000a      years with experts from Birmingham, BMW, Daimler Benz, Fiat, Volvo, and\u000a      GEC Plessey. The resulting EN 301-091 [5.4] set the standard for Europe\u000a      and was used as the template for the FCC standard for North America.\u000a    Hoare also sat on the EU committee setting standards for 24GHz radar\u000a      systems. The committee, comprising experts from Birmingham, BMW, Daimler\u000a      Benz, Fiat, Volvo and Siemens, set the spectrum occupancy standard and\u000a      addressed objections from existing users of the 24 GHz band. The resulting\u000a      standard, EN 302 288 [5.5] remains in force until 2016.\u000a    4.3 Professional Practitioner Training\u000a    A dedicated 3-day course, \"Understanding Automotive Radar, Theory,\u000a      Practice and Current Development,\" was developed and delivered by Hoare at\u000a      Birmingham, at Jaguar Cars, and at Ford Detroit between 1999 and 2009,\u000a      with approximately 30 attendees per course. The course is for automotive\u000a      engineers with no formal background in radar to enable them to understand\u000a      the capabilities of radar systems and issues associated with their\u000a      deployment. The impact arises from the fact that many participants are now\u000a      in management positions with responsibility for radar sensing within JLR.\u000a    4.4 Ongoing Impacts\u000a    Research described at the end of section 2 is paving the way for further\u000a      novel, technologically advanced, cost effective and saleable features\u000a      which will increase vehicle sales revenues and contribute further to\u000a      improving the safety of all road users in accordance with EU directives.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Two decades of radar research at The University of Birmingham have had\u000a      profound impacts on automotive radar systems.

Pycock, Senior\u000a      Lecturer, 1989-). The radar expertise was founded on extensive prior\u000a      experience in military radar.\u000a    In the PROMETHEUS project (1992-1995), Birmingham researchers worked with\u000a      a European consortium to research systems for reducing road accidents.\u000a      Using prototype radar units in the laboratory and on Jaguar research\u000a      vehicles, Cooper and Hoare obtained data in controlled and real\u000a      environments. After collaborative evaluation of mm-wave and laser radars\u000a      and optical systems, 77 GHz radar was chosen for its all-weather\u000a      capability, forming the focus of subsequent groundbreaking research at\u000a      Birmingham [3.1].\u000a    Laboratory radar measurements of vehicles, humans, animals and road\u000a      infrastructure, on mm-wave antennas and on radar transceivers [3.1]\u000a      established feasibility at a fundamental level. Research into mm-wave\u000a      sensors for cruise control and collision avoidance established for the\u000a      first time the possibility of mass manufacturing, at viable cost, complex\u000a      sensors which were previously only available in expensive military\u000a      systems. Advances included algorithms for automated radar self-alignment\u000a      in production [5.4] and research into false target identification.\u000a    European projects, Foresight Vehicle projects and collaborations with\u000a      Jaguar supported the expansion of the research to cover multiple aspects\u000a      of automotive radar [3.5]. In ROADAR, Birmingham research showed how image\u000a      processing could display the road trajectory up to 100m ahead, using radar\u000a      returns from road edges, curbs, crash barriers and roadside furniture.\u000a      [3.2-3.4]\u000a    The SHORSENS project investigated data fusion from mm-wave ultra-wideband\u000a      radar and optical systems for pedestrian detection and collision\u000a      avoidance. Birmingham produced ultra-wideband radar hardware and signal\u000a      processing. Combining high resolution vision images from Cranfield (with\u000a      limited range information) with high resolution radar range information\u000a      from Birmingham (with limited pixel resolution) enabled pedestrian\u000a      detection for collision mitigation.\u000a    In SLIMSENS [3.6] a 16-beam 77 GHz FMCW radar demonstrator, operating\u000a      through the same aperture as a 63 GHz radio, was successfully developed\u000a      and demonstrated. E2V and BAE systems built the hardware. Birmingham's\u000a      expertise was critical in the antenna and system design, and in developing\u000a      advanced prototype micromachined antennas.\u000a    As part of the European RadarNet consortium, Hoare and Pycock designed\u000a      signal processing software and control systems for 76 GHz, 4-sensor arrays\u000a      on five vehicles, each dedicated to one European manufacturer and\u000a      optimised for a different application (collision avoidance, pedestrian\u000a      detection, etc.).\u000a    Fundamental 24 GHz ultra-wideband radar system research, funded by Jaguar\u000a      (2007-2008), established key operational parameters and investigated\u000a      effects of rain and spray, radar signatures of vehicles, pedestrians,\u000a      animals and bicycles. The resulting data were used in subsequent JLR\u000a      funded research (2008-2011) into rear-facing short range 24 GHz radars.\u000a      Birmingham provided radar expertise to define system operating parameters,\u000a      to log and evaluate data from extensive road trials and to assess antenna\u000a      manufacturing issues.\u000a    JLR continues to support long-term research into radar sensing of the\u000a      vehicle environment, including road surface sensing, multisensor\u000a      high-resolution imaging, and speed over ground.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38845","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Mobile phones are currently the biggest selling piece of electronic\u000d\u000a      equipment and have changed the way society interacts, from the one to one\u000d\u000a      level, to their use to gather large groups of people together for\u000d\u000a      political purposes. Today they are much more than a phone, but\u000d\u000a      communications remains at the centre of their capabilities, through mobile\u000d\u000a      connection to the Internet and other data services.\u000d\u000a    This revolution was primarily enabled by the introduction of the 3G\u000d\u000a      standard in 2000\/2001. As part of this, governments around the world\u000d\u000a      auctioned new spectrum. For example, the major operators in the UK\u000d\u000a      invested over &#163;22bn as part of this process. Like the second GSM band,\u000d\u000a      this increase in bands again placed high demands on antenna design.\u000d\u000a      Achieving small size for four or more bands with high efficiency was the\u000d\u000a      goal and the Birmingham concept was again used in the design process. Due\u000d\u000a      to the high investment for 3G, lead time was even more significant.\u000d\u000a    The initial response to the need for additional band coverage, [5.1], is\u000d\u000a      to fit an extra antenna into the handset case. However the number of other\u000d\u000a      components, such as the camera and accelerometers for example, mean that\u000d\u000a      there is an increasing demand on internal handset volume. Having two\u000d\u000a      antennas means that the size of each must be smaller. A reduction of the\u000d\u000a      antenna size results in reduced antenna efficiency, with a significant\u000d\u000a      reduction on battery life, which also significantly increases the\u000d\u000a      environmental impact of owning a phone, due to increased charging times.\u000d\u000a      The only solution is to make the antenna multi-band.\u000d\u000a    After the publication of the first Birmingham paper, [3.1], many\u000d\u000a      industrial groups around the world began work on the problem, such as,\u000d\u000a      Nokia, Lucent, Filtronic, Motorola and Sony-Ericsson. The nature of mobile\u000d\u000a      phone design is that all phones are different in small or large ways.\u000d\u000a      Whilst some differences may be software based and use the same hardware,\u000d\u000a      many relate to handset size and shape, the inclusion of additional\u000d\u000a      hardware and the capability to operate over the various bands available.\u000d\u000a      The availability of RF front end chipsets and digital processor chipsets\u000d\u000a      also changed during the period. This means that the internal layout of the\u000d\u000a      phones change regularly and as a consequence the antennas need to be\u000d\u000a      redesigned for each phone. In addition, companies need to protect their\u000d\u000a      intellectual property, by finding variations on the basic principle. The\u000d\u000a      process of antenna redesign and variation can be seen in the patents for\u000d\u000a      multi-band antennas.\u000d\u000a    Patents must refer to previous publications and patents, but need not\u000d\u000a      describe the subsequent exploitation of the ideas described. Many of the\u000d\u000a      patents noted in [5.2] reference one of the Birmingham papers. Although\u000d\u000a      other papers are quoted, they are on other aspects of antenna design, and\u000d\u000a      thus the Birmingham papers are the prime source of the slot concept for\u000d\u000a      mobile phone antennas. Some of the companies that have filed patents do\u000d\u000a      not make handsets, and it is difficult to trace the on-going path from\u000d\u000a      those patents to market. However 21 of those patents are from Nokia, who\u000d\u000a      had by far the biggest share of the handset market during the REF impact\u000d\u000a      period. Patents for both dual band antennas, for the two 2G GSM bands and\u000d\u000a      four or more bands for 3G, are described in [5.2]. Antennas that are close\u000d\u000a      in form to the drawings in these patents have been identified by Professor\u000d\u000a      Hall's group by disassembly of actual handsets.\u000d\u000a    Patents describing other methods of achieving multi-band antenna action\u000d\u000a      in a small size are also given in [5.2]. In some sense, they also owe\u000d\u000a      something to the Birmingham papers, but a direct relationship is hard to\u000d\u000a      show, as no references are made. In addition these are from companies that\u000d\u000a      have much lower market share than Nokia, and are much less influential in\u000d\u000a      terms of total impact.\u000d\u000a    In Corroborating Source [5.3], the Head of Motorola Antenna Group,\u000d\u000a      Florida, USA, writes, \"The conception and dissemination .... of the\u000d\u000a      multi-band planar inverted F antenna, by Prof Hall.... has been a key\u000d\u000a      enabler for the development of ever more capable .... mobile phones\" and\u000d\u000a      \"An even stronger indication is the frequent reference to PIFAs as prior\u000d\u000a      art in patents ... clear testament of the seminal value of the original\u000d\u000a      concept developed by Prof Hall...\"\u000d\u000a    In Corroborating Source [5.4] the Sony Ericsson designated expert in\u000d\u000a      terminal antenna technologies writes, \"I knew your work very well, this\u000d\u000a      paper was the first academic paper to tell how to design a dual band PIFA\u000d\u000a      antenna system\" and \"Your work is definite the first paper to guide\u000d\u000a      industry to realize it in the practical products.\"\u000d\u000a    The value of the multi-band antennas in Nokia phones can be estimated\u000d\u000a      from the market share and market size, [5.5]. Trefis.com, a business\u000d\u000a      analysis organisation, states that \"We estimate that Nokia will have 2011\u000d\u000a      market share of 30% in the 1.1 billion mobile phone market within emerging\u000d\u000a      markets and 17% market share in the 500 million mobile phone market within\u000d\u000a      developed markets.\" Forbes, indicate an approximately linear variation of\u000d\u000a      the Nokia market share over the period, from 45% in 2008 to 23% in 2012.\u000d\u000a      At the time of writing data for 2013 was not available. The typical value\u000d\u000a      of each antenna can be estimated from the costs as advertised in web based\u000d\u000a      catalogues from Chinese companies. For example, the antenna for the Nokia\u000d\u000a      N6300 costs $0.75 and for the N76 cost $1.35.\u000d\u000a    From this data the likely value of antennas in all Nokia phones over the\u000d\u000a      period can be estimated. The equation below has two parts, as the total\u000d\u000a      market share is the sum of the shares in the developed and emerging\u000d\u000a      markets. A market share is averaged over the period. An average antenna\u000d\u000a      value of around $ 1 is used.\u000d\u000a    Value = (developed market size x market share x average antenna value x\u000d\u000a      period)\u000d\u000a    + (emerging market size x market share x average antenna value x period)\u000d\u000a    = (1.1 billion x 30 % x 1 $ x 5 years)\u000d\u000a    + (0.5 billion x 17 % x 1 $ x 5 years)\u000d\u000a    = $ 415 million\u000d\u000a    With an average market share of 30% for Nokia, it could be assumed that\u000d\u000a      the total value of antennas designed using the Birmingham concept could be\u000d\u000a      double this amount. In addition, it is difficult to extend the above\u000d\u000a      calculation to the impact on Nokia's turnover during the REF period,\u000d\u000a      However, since Nokia was in profit during this period, it is reasonable to\u000d\u000a      assume that this had a direct impact on their revenues and, assuming no\u000d\u000a      margin, this equates to a revenue contribution in excess of $400M and a\u000d\u000a      global contribution of twice this. Whilst this is only indicative, it does\u000d\u000a      serve to illustrate the magnitude of the impact.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Increasing use of mobile phones and the consequent congestion of the\u000d\u000a      original bands have meant that over the last decade, additional bands have\u000d\u000a      been released, and all current mobile phones need to operate at up to five\u000d\u000a      different frequency bands. Professor Hall's group supported by &#163;160k from\u000d\u000a      British Telecom Labs, showed how to design a multi-band planar inverted F\u000d\u000a      antenna, using slots in the antenna top plate. The published papers have\u000d\u000a      since been quoted in many industrial patents and widely acknowledged to be\u000d\u000a      the first publications of the antenna. Nokia, who had the largest market\u000d\u000a      share in the REF period, based their antenna designs on the slot concept,\u000d\u000a      and hence a large proportion of the several billion phones in the world\u000d\u000a      today use this antenna, with a financial value of many millions of pounds.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Birmingham\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4155751","Name":"Florida"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    The outputs that best indicate the quality of the underpinning research\u000d\u000a      are references 3.2, 3. 4 and 3.5\u000d\u000a    \u000a3.1 Liu, Z.

An important part\u000d\u000a      of an RF transmitter or receiver is the antenna. The RF circuits\u000d\u000a      themselves, e.g. amplifiers or filters cannot radiate or receive radio\u000d\u000a      waves efficiently on their own. The first mobile phones used antennas\u000d\u000a      external to the case, the stub antenna or the pull out whip antenna.\u000d\u000a      However it soon became clear that consumers did not want external\u000d\u000a      antennas. Early mobile phones, with internal antennas, used the planar\u000d\u000a      inverted F antenna, (PIFA), which consists of a metal top plate suspended\u000d\u000a      above a ground plane, which is usually the printed circuit board of the\u000d\u000a      phone. The size of a well-designed PIFA antenna has to be about a quarter\u000d\u000a      of a wavelength at the frequency of operation, and would typically occupy\u000d\u000a      the top quarter of the mobile phone. The pressure on performance and size\u000d\u000a      is a continual challenge for antenna designers.\u000d\u000a    In 1994, as consumer demand soared, Professor Hall (Professor of\u000d\u000a      Electronic and Electrical Engineering, 1994-) identified that spectral\u000d\u000a      congestion was pushing the Government to release new frequency bands and\u000d\u000a      that multi-band antennas would be needed. The key problem was to find a\u000d\u000a      multi-band antenna small enough to fit inside the phone case. Good design\u000d\u000a      of the antenna is important to the mobile phone, both in terms of\u000d\u000a      maximising the battery life and keeping the power dissipated in the user,\u000d\u000a      below the safe exposure limits set by Governments.\u000d\u000a    Professor Hall has been researching into antenna design for over 35 years\u000d\u000a      and built an internationally renowned team at Birmingham of over fifteen\u000d\u000a      researchers and three staff members. Important indicators to quality are\u000d\u000a      over 350 publications, H factor of 19, total citations of 1360 (Web of\u000d\u000a      Science). Hall recently gained the IEEE John Kraus Award for Contributions\u000d\u000a      to Antenna Design, the European Association for Antennas and Propagation\u000d\u000a      Award (EurAAP) for Contributions to Antennas in Europe and IET LAPC\u000d\u000a      Lifetime Award for Work on Printed and Active Antennas, and Body Centric\u000d\u000a      Wireless Communications. Hall has obtained over &#163;5M in research support\u000d\u000a      since 1994, with over &#163;500k from industry. The group are currently\u000d\u000a      involved in spinning out a company to exploit a set of patents relating to\u000d\u000a      the design of 4G mobile phone antennas.\u000d\u000a    The specific research for this case study was funded by BT Labs (&#163;161K)\u000d\u000a      and took place between 1995 and 2001. Professor Hall supervised the work\u000d\u000a      of two talented PhD students, Dr Z Liu and Dr P Song, who along with over\u000d\u000a      30 other PhD and MPhil students graduated by Hall, have since gone into\u000d\u000a      academia and the antenna research and development industry, around the\u000d\u000a      world.\u000d\u000a    The results were six seminal papers, Section 3, the first being a Letter,\u000d\u000a      [3.1], followed by papers in major conferences in USA and Japan, [3.2,3.3]\u000d\u000a      and then by an IEEE Transaction paper, [3.4]. These were followed by a\u000d\u000a      further conference paper and letter, [3.5, 3.6], showing extensions to the\u000d\u000a      method.\u000d\u000a    The papers describe how to insert one or more slots into the top plate of\u000d\u000a      a PIFA, to make it operate in two or more bands. The slots create a number\u000d\u000a      of different current paths in the plate, each of which has a\u000d\u000a      characteristic length and thus a different resonant frequency, [5.2]. The\u000d\u000a      Transaction paper also shows the effect of slot position and slot length,\u000d\u000a      which have an effect of the shifting relative frequency of the two (or\u000d\u000a      multiple) bands. Variants were shown that had either a single or multiple\u000d\u000a      connectors. This was important, because it was clear that some handset\u000d\u000a      manufacturers would use separate transmitters and receivers for the two\u000d\u000a      bands, which would need two antenna connectors, whilst others would\u000d\u000a      develop combined systems, requiring a single connector. The method of\u000d\u000a      putting slots in the PIFA top plate, described in the papers, remains the\u000d\u000a      key step in the design of many mobile phone antennas for handsets. Because\u000d\u000a      all handsets have a different internal layout to provide the different set\u000d\u000a      of features, the antennas have to be re-designed for each new handset.\u000d\u000a      However, use of slots in the top plate is a common feature in all of them.\u000d\u000a      In addition to mobile handsets, the multiband PIFA antenna is used for\u000d\u000a      cellular communications in vehicles. The value for the idea, calculated in\u000d\u000a      the following section, does not include the vehicle applications.\u000d\u000a    Subsequently, the method of slotting the top plate was referenced by many\u000d\u000a      industrial patents from a number of companies. Corroborating Source [5.2]\u000d\u000a      describes over 50 such patents, in particular 21 from Nokia, 6 from\u000d\u000a      Centurion and others from RIM (Blackberry), Sony-Ericsson and FCI. The\u000d\u000a      date of the first Birmingham paper, [3.1], July 1996, predates the filing\u000d\u000a      of the first patent discovered in our search, by 17 months. This lead time\u000d\u000a      is significant in industrial terms, for the second 2G GSM band was\u000d\u000a      allocated in the UK in 1996\/97.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38846","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The following list demonstrates the impact of the Railways Systems Group,\u000a      the primary\u000a      beneficiaries of are the railway network and train operators in the UK,\u000a      and overseas, with improvements\u000a      in services benefiting rail users.\u000a    Railway Point Condition Monitoring\u000a    The key measurable in the rail industry for impact is train delay\u000a      minutes. The cost associated with\u000a      delay varies dependent on the type of train service, but lies in the range\u000a      of &#163;20\/minute (non-critical\u000a      freight trains) to &#163;160 (inter-city trains).\u000a    Collaboration on railway point condition monitoring has been ongoing with\u000a      Network Rail since\u000a      2004. Initial work helped to develop a business case for railway condition\u000a      monitoring [5.1] which\u000a      resulted in &#163;40M of investment by Network Rail as part of their\u000a      Intelligent Infrastructure\u000a      programme. The group has been key to this programme, providing algorithms\u000a      for fault detection\u000a      and diagnosis that have now been implemented on 5,600 out of 27,000 point\u000a      machines. `The initial\u000a        implementation was on HW type point machines, has resulted in an\u000a        estimated reduction of\u000a        29.4% of point machine faults; leading to a substantial reduction in the\u000a        amount of delay\u000a        minutes attributed to Network Rail'. In the one year period between\u000a      2010-11 there were 646,083\u000a      minutes delay on the network due to points failure. Since the rollout of\u000a      the system in 2012 the\u000a      number of delay minutes has dropped to 579,063 [5.2].\u000a    Following the success of this work on point machine monitoring with\u000a      Network Rail, the group were\u000a      approached in 2010 to carry out a monitoring trial on the Japan Central\u000a      Shinkansen High Speed\u000a      `Bullet Train' line South of Tokyo. Following the initial data collection\u000a      exercise Japan Central\u000a      Railways seconded an employee to the University of Birmingham for 2 years\u000a      to work with the team\u000a      to develop a system for application in Japan [5.4]. Following this work,\u000a      Japan Central Railways has\u000a      begun an implementation programme on all of their Shinkansen lines. In\u000a      addition to Japan, initial\u000a      trials have been undertaken with Deutsche Bahn in Berlin [5.3] and Hefei\u000a      Metro in China.\u000a      Based on the success of the Birmingham condition monitoring algorithm\u000a      research for the Intelligent\u000a      Infrastructure programme, in February 2012 Network Rail formed a &#163;1.65M\u000a      investment Strategic\u000a      Partnership with the group in the area of Data Integration and Management\u000a      to further develop the\u000a      existing algorithm work as well as developing new applications.\u000a    Conductor shoe monitoring\u000a    A collaborative industry research project has resulted in the University\u000a      of Birmingham together with\u000a      Southern Railway and Network Rail being awarded the Stephenson Award for\u000a      Innovation at the\u000a      National Rail Awards in 2012. The work, which developed an in-service\u000a      condition monitoring\u000a      system to assess the state-of-the-health of the power conductor rail,\u000a      automatically identifies\u000a      sections of track that put excessive force into a train's conductor shoe.\u000a      In 2012, the system\u000a      identified more than 30 locations that required remedial action in the\u000a      Southern region; previously\u000a      these locations were unidentifable. In 2012, 25,000 minutes of train delay\u000a      were caused by\u000a      conductor rail problems of this kind [5.6], with an average of delay of\u000a      405 minutes per incident. This\u000a      initial deployment of the system has therefore an estimated savings of\u000a      12,105 minutes.\u000a    Track circuit monitoring\u000a    Previous research work [3.1], funded directly by London Underground, is\u000a      now being used in this\u000a      REF period to provide expert advice through consultancy work that is\u000a      specifying and designing an\u000a      innovative track circuit condition monitoring system (hardware, algorithms\u000a      and architecture) for\u000a      London Underground. This system will revolutionise how London Underground\u000a      maintain one of\u000a      their key assets, allowing them to move from a scheduled to reactive\u000a      maintenance regime. London\u000a      Underground will invest `several million pounds over the next 5 to 10\u000a        years' in this technology [5.5].\u000a    Bearing Monitoring\u000a    In 2012 Hitachi received a &#163;7 billion order from the Department for\u000a      Transport to build a new fleet of\u000a      trains for the UK. One of the key criteria for selection of Hitachi was\u000a      due to the proposed method\u000a      for the safe rollout and the ongoing life cycle cost benefits of the new\u000a      train. This, in part, is based\u000a      on a series of monitoring systems to ensure the health of key components.\u000a      In the area of wheel\u000a      bearing safety, these assertions have been based on expert advice from\u000a      research undertaken by\u000a      the University in collaboration with Hitachi to develop a prototype\u000a      acoustic monitoring system that\u000a      was able to detect and diagnose bearing and gearbox faults on the new\u000a      train. During Phase 1 of\u000a      the project field trials took place to verify the work. Phase 2, which is\u000a      currently underway, is\u000a      developing a full prototype system that will be sited on the High Speed 1\u000a      line in early 2014.\u000a    Inertial Measurement Unit\u000a    In 2011 and 2012 in-service inertial measurement units have been\u000a      developed and deployed on two\u000a      in-service trains for MerseyRail and Southern that are able to identify\u000a      track locations that require\u000a      maintenance. These systems are the first of their kind in the UK, and are\u000a      currently operating on the\u000a      UK network. As part of the EPSRC Track 21 Programme Grant, the system\u000a      monitoring the track in\u000a      the south of England has been used by Network Rail to help steer and\u000a      monitoring a track renewal\u000a      at Black Boy Lane Level Crossing in the Southern Region.\u000a    Gauge corner cracking instrumentation\u000a    In 2012, the University demonstrated the first high speed gauge corner\u000a      cracking test system in\u000a      collaboration with REFER, the Portuguese railway infrastructure manager.\u000a      The system is designed\u000a      to detect and quantify rolling contact fatigue cracks on the rail gauge\u000a      corner. The system\u000a      integrates ultrasonic, vision and ACFM (alternating current field\u000a      measurement) technology. The\u000a      integration of these systems allows high speed inspection to be carried\u000a      out. The system operates\u000a      at up to 120 kph, whereas conventional systems typically operated at 30-40\u000a      kph\u000a    Energy monitoring\u000a    Environmental impact is evident throughout the groups work; however it is\u000a      particularly predominant\u000a      in this study. In 2012 a monitoring and simulation study was undertaken to\u000a      drive a system-wide\u000a      energy saving on the MerseyRail network. The study has been developed for\u000a      long-term monitoring\u000a      of the MerseyRail network looking at DC railway power systems to\u000a      understand the losses, and\u000a      hence set the price of the energy paid by the train operating companies\u000a      throughout Britain. The\u000a      work is led by the University of Birmingham and is supported by Network\u000a      Rail and the Department\u000a      for Transport with in kind contributions from MerseyRail, Association of\u000a      Train Operating\u000a      Companies, the Rail Safety and Standards Board, London Underground and\u000a      Angel Trains. The\u000a      work has highlighted key energy saving strategies and will inform future\u000a      train procurement for the\u000a      MerseyRail, and other networks. The results of the study have been issued\u000a      to the Office of the Rail\u000a      Regulator in Network Rail's report TPD-NST-021 LOSS-REP-0012 which is\u000a      being used to set the\u000a      price of the energy paid by the train operating companies throughout the\u000a      UK [5.7]. This is a key\u000a      step in helping the rail industry meet its target of achieving a 20%\u000a      reduction in energy usage by\u000a      2020 (which equates to an annual saving of 580 GWh of electricity and 91\u000a      million litres of diesel).\u000a      Following the success of this work, a project is now underway with\u000a      Guangzhou Metro in China.\u000a    Winter mitigation\u000a    Since winter 2009 the group has developed specific instrumentation and a\u000a      number of national test\u000a      rig to help Network Rail manage the effect of snow and ice. The research\u000a      undertaken has helped\u000a      Network Rail in understanding the cause of winter problems, and hence\u000a      write requirements and\u000a      standards for the rail industry for winter mitigation measures and assess\u000a      the develop\u000a      benchmarking tests evaluate manufacturers solutions. So far the University\u000a      has helped specify and\u000a      evaluate over 30 different products, on which Network Rail now spends\u000a      approximately spent\u000a      around &#163;200k to &#163;500k per year. The work undertaken by the University was\u000a      identified as a\u000a      successful collaboration case study in the Department for Transport's\u000a      Railway Industry Research\u000a      Strategy document [5.8]. Furthermore, in 2010 the Rail Industry's National\u000a      Task Force, to which\u000a      the University provides advice, referred to the importance of the work\u000a      being undertaken by the\u000a      University when giving evidence to the Transport Select Committee [5.9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Railway Systems Group develops state-of-the-art condition monitoring\u000a      and instrumentation\u000a      systems that identify system faults before they degrade into failures that\u000a      cause passenger\u000a      disruption. The key impacts of the Railway Systems Group lie in the\u000a      following areas:\u000a    \u000a      Detection and diagnosis of faults in railway assets (e.g. point\u000a        machines, track circuits,\u000a        vehicle components);\u000a      Collection and analysis of track data from in-service railway vehicles\u000a        (e.g. conductor shoe\u000a        monitoring, track geometry, non-destructive testing);\u000a      Energy monitoring to quantify loses in the railway power system;\u000a      Assessing the effectiveness of winter weather mitigation solutions.\u000a    \u000a    Examples of direct quantifiable impact are a reduction of over 60,000\u000a      minutes in train delays over\u000a      the last one year period through monitoring of 5,600 railway point\u000a      machines (the cost to Network\u000a      Rail of delays is between &#163;20\/min to &#163;160\/min).

The group was founded in the 1970's. The group\u000a      holds a strong\u000a      international reputation for undertaking industrially focussed research.\u000a    The research in railway condition monitoring has been carried out by\u000a      three academic staff (C\u000a      Roberts, Professor of Railways System Engineering, 1997-, Dr S Hillmansen,\u000a      Senior Lecturer,\u000a      2006- , Dr E Stewart, Birmingham Research Fellow, 2007-). Since 2008, 20\u000a      PhD students have\u000a      worked (or are currently working) in this area. The active research\u000a      contracts over this period total\u000a      over &#163;7M, which includes involvement in 9 European Framework projects, 3\u000a      EPSRC projects\u000a      (including a programme grant), a large ERDF initiative and numerous\u000a      industrially funded projects.\u000a      Since 2008, the group has published over 50 papers in international peer\u000a      reviewed journals.\u000a      In addition to funding from the UK, railway condition monitoring research\u000a      has been supported by\u000a      funding and collaborations from Hitachi (Japan), Central Railways (Japan),\u000a      Deutsche Bahn\u000a      (Germany), Alstom (France), Trafikverket (Sweden) and REFER (Portugal).\u000a    Professor Roberts, who leads the group, has excellent research esteem.\u000a      For example he is\u000a      founder and chair of the biennial IET International Conference in Railway\u000a      Condition Monitoring\u000a      (since 2003). In 2008 Professor Roberts gave a keynote address at the\u000a      International Federation of\u000a      Automatic Control (IFAC) SAFEPROCESS conference detailing the significant\u000a      academic progress\u000a      and industrial take-up of railway condition monitoring, which was followed\u000a      in 2013 by a keynote\u000a      address at the IFAC Workshop on Advances in Control and Automation Theory\u000a      for Transportation.\u000a      In 2011 Professor Roberts was asked to give the IMechE Railway Division\u000a      Annual Research\u000a      Lecture on his work in the field of railway condition monitoring. In 2013\u000a      he developed and co-chaired\u000a      the 1st IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Rail\u000a      Transportation in Beijing.\u000a      Research at Birmingham has focused on:\u000a    (1) The development of sophisticated bespoke instrumentation that\u000a      is designed to be resilient to\u000a      the harsh and variable environments of the railway. The instrumentation,\u000a      based on distributed\u000a      embedded system design, has been installed on railways throughout the\u000a      world (UK, Portugal,\u000a      Germany, Sweden, Japan). Research focuses on solutions that are able to\u000a      work in-service without\u000a      human intervention. A current project funded by the EPSRC, as part of the\u000a      Track 21 Programme\u000a      Grant, has the objective to advise on appropriate instrumentation systems\u000a      for the proposed High\u000a      Speed 2 railway line as well as in other key projects. Other work is\u000a      developing distributed acoustic\u000a      monitoring system to be used by Hitachi to detect bearing faults on its &#163;7\u000a      billion Intercity Express\u000a      Programme trains due to begin operation in the UK between 2016-2018. Some\u000a      of the technology\u000a      developed by the group for railways has been applied to wind turbines in\u000a      Greece [3.1];\u000a    (2) The development of robust data processing algorithms that are\u000a      able to process the data\u000a      collected from the instrumentation in close to real-time in order to\u000a      detect incipient faults in systems,\u000a      or at particular locations on the track. In recent years research has\u000a      moved on to fault diagnosis and\u000a      prognosis, and this work has begun to be used in the field, most notably\u000a      as part of Network Rail's\u000a      Intelligent Infrastructure programme. For use in railway environments,\u000a      where system, climate and\u000a      usage varies, it has been shown that conventional condition monitoring\u000a      approaches are not\u000a      suitable. The group has pioneered and demonstrated under real life\u000a      condition the benefits of\u000a      combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. Initial work focused on\u000a      algorithms for the\u000a      condition monitoring of point machines [3.2]. This work was further\u000a      enhanced and applied to track\u000a      circuits [3.3], track geometry measurement using bogie mounted inertial\u000a      measurements systems\u000a      [3.4], acoustic emission sensors for crack growth monitoring [3.5] and\u000a      non-destructive testing\u000a      evaluation systems for rail and wheelset monitoring [3.6];\u000a    (3) In parallel with this work, collaborative research with\u000a      Network Rail has been undertaken to\u000a      develop clear, engineering led business cases to support the roll-out of\u000a      condition monitoring [3.7].\u000a      This work has been important to Network Rail proceeding with its\u000a      Intelligent Infrastructure\u000a      programme. Additional research has also been undertaken to use\u000a      instrumentation to help evaluate\u000a      the effectives of subsystems, particularly to evaluate performance in\u000a      winter weather. Through this\u000a      research the University has developed standard test procedure to help\u000a      Network Rail evaluate the\u000a      effectiveness of winter mitigation measures.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40541","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact that our research has had can be demonstrated in the\u000d\u000a      commercial application (described at the end of this section) but also in\u000d\u000a      the recognition received:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      a Chairman's award from BAE Systems;\u000d\u000a      Surrey was awarded a commercialisation award for &#163;250k from SEEDA;\u000d\u000a      SNS received a &#163;750k investment from IP Group;\u000d\u000a      SNS equipment sales of &#163;1.5M per annum to the global research\u000d\u000a        community during the start-up phase alone.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The semiconductor industry, whose worth is measured in billions of\u000d\u000a      dollars, urgently needs new interconnection technology and low-k\u000d\u000a      dielectrics to maintain the pace of innovation according to Moore's law.\u000d\u000a      The limitations of existing manufacturing technology threaten the\u000d\u000a      evolution to next-generation geometry sizes, speeds and power\u000d\u000a      conservation.\u000d\u000a    Manufacturers in the semiconductor industry, currently use copper to\u000d\u000a      provide the vertical interconnections required for integrated circuit (IC)\u000d\u000a      fabrication. Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) can be structured to act as extremely\u000d\u000a      efficient conductors, but their adoption as a replacement for copper has\u000d\u000a      been hindered by the fact that conventionally grown CNTs require\u000d\u000a      temperatures of around 700 degrees centigrade. This is too high for\u000d\u000a      semiconductor processing, and leads to the destruction of the microchip\u000d\u000a      circuitry. In parallel, the semiconductor industry has continuing needs\u000d\u000a      for better dielectric materials. In this context, better means lower\u000d\u000a      dielectric constant with solid materials preferred over highly porous\u000d\u000a      systems. The materials processes must integrate smoothly with the\u000d\u000a      remaining processes as the technology need is for an incremental change\u000d\u000a      rather than a disruptive re-engineering.\u000d\u000a    \"SNS's low-k material offers a potential step change for\u000d\u000a          dielectrics with a k value that meets the requirements of 22 nm\u000d\u000a          integrated circuit technology\" Chair of ITRS Interconnect Working\u000d\u000a          Group\u000d\u000a    These two, well-understood industry needs are the primary target market\u000d\u000a      for Surrey NanoSystems Ltd.

In this case, the primary initiating research\u000d\u000a      was a MOD contract placed through BAe Systems (Sowerby, Bristol) in\u000d\u000a      1997\/8. Surrey's research team (led by Prof. Silva) were carrying out\u000d\u000a      research on stealth materials and high emissivity surfaces. This led to\u000d\u000a      the development of new techniques for the production of thin-film carbon\u000d\u000a      coatings [1].\u000d\u000a    The key inventive step was that the team recognised that the use of\u000d\u000a      heating from above the substrate together with an engineered surface layer\u000d\u000a      allowed high temperature carbon CVD growth processes with the bulk\u000d\u000a      substrate kept at low temperature [2-5]. This recognition resulted from\u000d\u000a      previous experience in rapid thermal annealing process development, with\u000d\u000a      the heat being delivered by an array of halogen lamps. This process is now\u000d\u000a      known as Photo-Thermal Chemical Vapour Deposition (PTCVD) [3,5].\u000d\u000a    It was apparent that this new technique could address a key challenge in\u000d\u000a      the application of carbon nanotubes in the production of integrated\u000d\u000a      circuits, specifically in advanced CMOS. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have\u000d\u000a      well-understood advantages, particularly as interlayer vias, but were not\u000d\u000a      hitherto grown at sufficient quality at process temperatures that CMOS\u000d\u000a      devices can withstand.\u000d\u000a    In the course of developing the CNT growth process it was discovered that\u000d\u000a      a new polymer material could be deposited using the same essential CVD\u000d\u000a      process. This polymer was found to have very low dielectric constant,\u000d\u000a      capable of meeting a further need of the advanced CMOS industry [6].\u000d\u000a    The research work (2001-5) has resulted in the filing of multiple\u000d\u000a      patents, often in conjunction with industrial collaborators. Subsequent to\u000d\u000a      patent filings, papers were published in high impact journals including\u000d\u000a      Nature Materials [3,5].\u000d\u000a    Recognising the significant commercial potential of both aspects of this\u000d\u000a      work the team partnered with the then Regional Development Agency SEEDA to\u000d\u000a      spin-out these elements of the research through the formation of Surrey\u000d\u000a      NanoSystems Ltd (2008). Research activity has continued to support this\u000d\u000a      spin-out business. SNS initially operated as a supplier of PTCVD and\u000d\u000a      allied growth equipment to the global research community. Following\u000d\u000a      second-round venture funding the business re-aligned to the exploitation\u000d\u000a      of the process knowledge directly to semiconductor majors.\u000d\u000a    Further research themes have developed from this work. Current\u000d\u000a      commercially-funded activity includes the development of a\u000d\u000a      moisture-barrier coating, initially for satellite components, but having\u000d\u000a      potential for future application in encapsulation of organic semiconductor\u000d\u000a      devices. The PTCVD process is expected to have important future\u000d\u000a      application in the formation of graphene layers, with the halogen lamps\u000d\u000a      being replaced with high-power LEDs to allow the more rapid modulation of\u000d\u000a      the power.\u000d\u000a    The Surrey research team was led by Prof R.Silva included G.Y.Chen,\u000d\u000a      B.O.Boskovic, S.Haq and V.Stolojan\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40543","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact has been created from the original idea and research on the\u000d\u000a      feasibility of the system.

This introduces a number of significant limitations:\u000d\u000a    (1) all stereo parameters (inter-ocular distance, convergence, zoom) are\u000d\u000a      fixed at the time of\u000d\u000a      acquisition;\u000d\u000a    (2) distortion between the stereo views occurs due to zoom and colour\u000d\u000a      differences;\u000d\u000a    (3) camera movement is restricted due to the stereo rig.

The advances greatly increasing the flexibility in stereo\u000d\u000a      3D production and allow\u000d\u000a      stereo image pairs to be produced from monocular camera views. The\u000d\u000a      fundamental research\u000d\u000a      advance at the University of Surrey underpinning this technology is the\u000d\u000a      introduction of robust\u000d\u000a      computer vision algorithms for 3D reconstruction from video of complex\u000d\u000a      natural scenes [1,2]. The\u000d\u000a      foundations for this technology are based on early research [5-6] which\u000d\u000a      pioneered the use of\u000d\u000a      multiple view images and video to capture 3D shape, and introduced the use\u000d\u000a      of this technology for\u000d\u000a      content production.\u000d\u000a    A significant research challenge faced by Surrey researchers has been the\u000d\u000a      reconstruction of highly\u000d\u000a      dynamic elements, such as people, whilst maintaining video-quality stereo\u000d\u000a      rendering. This has\u000d\u000a      been achieved by pioneering research introducing a framework for joint\u000d\u000a      segmentation and\u000d\u000a      reconstruction from multiple view video [2] which robustly solves two\u000d\u000a      classical problems in\u000d\u000a      computer vision. Information across views is exploited to overcome the\u000d\u000a      inherent ambiguity in single\u000d\u000a      view video analysis. This framework provides the basis for both\u000d\u000a      manipulation of stereo 3D\u000d\u000a      acquisition in post-production and creation of stereo image pairs from a\u000d\u000a      single moving monocular\u000d\u000a      cameras as used in conventional production. This research has recently\u000d\u000a      been extended [3,4] to\u000d\u000a      introduce the first integrated pipeline for 3D reconstruction of both\u000d\u000a      background scene and\u000d\u000a      foreground live action. This pipeline was used by film production company\u000d\u000a      BUF in EU project\u000d\u000a      i3Dpost and demonstrated in the productionof The Midas Touch (2011).\u000d\u000a    This research was led by Prof. Adrian Hilton in Surrey's Centre for\u000d\u000a      Vision, Speech and Signal\u000d\u000a      Processing (CVSSP) working with post-doctoral researchers Dr. Jean-Yves\u000d\u000a      Guillemaut (appointed\u000d\u000a      Lecturer in 3D Computer Vision, April 2012). Early research at Surrey [4]\u000d\u000a      was conducted by Dr.\u000d\u000a      Jonathan Starck as a PhD and post-doctoral research before he joined The\u000d\u000a      Foundry to lead their\u000d\u000a      research team. The Foundry has exploited Surrey research advances in 3D\u000d\u000a      video analysis to\u000d\u000a      extend their software tools (NUKE) from 2D compositing to full 3D video\u000d\u000a      editing.

The spinout\u000a      company was initially assisted both, financially, from the University seed\u000a      fund and Cascade fund,\u000a      and intellectually, on a long-term basis, by the University committing any\u000a      pipeline IP, to be\u000a      generated by Professor Kittler after OmniPerception had been formed, for\u000a      the benefit of the\u000a      company. The relationship between the University and the company mirrored\u000a      the business and\u000a      exploitation model used by the Stanford University in setting up the\u000a      speech recognition company\u000a      Nuance at about the same time.\u000a    The output of the applied research in biometrics carried out at the\u000a      University of Surrey after the\u000a      formation of the company with EPSRC and EU support, jointly with\u000a      government assisted\u000a      technology transfer programmes including SMART, KTP, and DTI Technology\u000a      (TSB) projects, had\u000a      generated innovative core face biometrics technology that attracted a\u000a      Venture Capital investment\u000a      of more than &#163;2 million to enable product development and engineering. In\u000a      2009, the production of\u000a      the OmniPerception technology was accelerated by a major investment from\u000a      BAe Systems via its\u000a      Investment in Innovation (I3) Programme, with a part of the funding\u000a      (&#163;250k) subcontracted back to\u000a      the University to develop solutions for cross spectral face matching and\u000a      pose invariant face\u000a      recognition.\u000a    The software engineering and product development have been facilitated by\u000a      the use of common\u000a      open source image processing library RAVL. This ensured that common\u000a      classes and structures\u000a      were used for algorithm development. In April 2012 the company merged with\u000a      Visimetrics, a major\u000a      UK biometrics technology integrator, to create an enterprise with the\u000a      combined capability to\u000a      manufacture high technology products, and to integrate them in advanced\u000a      security applications.\u000a    In 2013 Visimetrics was acquired by Digital Barriers, a fast growing SME\u000a      in Homeland Security\u000a      with then more than 200 employees.

The former\u000a        system requires user cooperation. It is deployed for access control to\u000a        data centres in banks,\u000a        and by Menzies to enhance security at UK airports to control access to\u000a        the air-side by cargo\u000a        handling staff. The latter version, launched only in 2011 captures and\u000a        processes face image on\u000a        the move, without the subject's awareness.

The advances made at Surrey\u000a      include multispectral\u000a      imaging and photometric normalisation to achieve illumination invariance\u000a      [6], robust face detection\u000a      and localisation using robust correlation [3,4], innovative representation\u000a      of face skin texture using a\u000a      multiscale local binary descriptor [2], a unique patented person specific\u000a      discriminant analysis,\u000a      which is exceptionally compact allowing face matching on a smart card [6],\u000a      facial component based\u000a      matching enhancing robustness to face localisation errors [5],[6], and\u000a      multi-algorithmic fusion,\u000a      exploiting a patented error correcting decision making approach [1].\u000a    The innovative method of face image representation and matching [6]\u000a      invented by Professor Kittler\u000a      in 2000, which is now protected by a European patent, has unique\u000a      properties. Its low\u000a      computational complexity opened, for the first time, the possibility of\u000a      implementing face verification\u000a      systems on a small computing platform, such as a smart card. This\u000a      contrasts with previous\u000a      solutions with computational complexity of 2-3 orders of magnitude\u000a      greater. In parallel, a multi-classifier\u000a      system based on the concept of error correcting coding was developed at\u000a      Surrey by\u000a      Kittler, Ghaderi and Windeatt, for face recognition scenarios where\u000a      computing power was not a\u000a      constraining factor. The work was published [1] after filing for\u000a      protection in 2001 [6]. It has the\u000a      capacity to enhance face recognition performance by a factor of two.\u000a    The intellectual property encompassed by the two patents was transferred\u000a      to a university spin out\u000a      company, OmniPerception Ltd. The technology transfer to OmniPerception Ltd\u000a      was aided first by a\u000a      KTP project KTP000982-A01 during the period 2005-2007. Further\u000a      enhancements, involving 3D\u000a      face model technology developed with the support from EPSRC Research Grant\u000a      GR\/S46543\/01,\u000a      entitled 2D+3D=ID, were transferred to OmniPerception with the financial\u000a      assistance from a TSB\u000a      Project K1533:' Visualisation tools for effective face matching' during\u000a      2007-2009, all projects\u000a      headed by Professor Kittler. In addition, applied research carried out at\u000a      Surrey after the spin out in\u000a      2002, resulted in significant enhancements of face detection [4] and face\u000a      localisation [3] methods.\u000a    The former is achieved using a novel correlation method, which is robust\u000a      to outliers (image\u000a      degradation). The latter has been developed to perform face localisation\u000a      in general conditions\u000a      where the pose of the face image deviates from the frontal.\u000a    Another key contribution was the work on skin texture representation,\u000a      carried out at Surrey in\u000a      2005-2007. the work, which was supported by EPSRC Project GR\/S98528\/01 and\u000a      EU Network of\u000a      Excellence in biometrics \"BIOSECURE\", resulted in a powerful innovative\u000a      face descriptor based on\u000a      the Local Binary Pattern operator. The proposed multiscale generalisation\u000a      enhanced the\u000a      performance of face recognition significantly.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40547","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Over many years the IBC has developed its portfolio of industrial users,\u000d\u000a      with bespoke processes\u000d\u000a      developed to meet the needs of the industrial customer.

Below are examples of the work\u000d\u000a      undertaken by the\u000d\u000a      IBC between 2008-13 for industry and the public sector, which reflect the\u000d\u000a      impact the IBC has\u000d\u000a      made.\u000d\u000a    Twin Creeks Technologies (USA) manufacture a new material for\u000d\u000a      solar-cell applications using a\u000d\u000a      technology devised by IBC (2008-2011). This method can produce\u000d\u000a      solar cells for about 40 cents\u000d\u000a      per watt, half that of even the most cheaply produced cells coming out of\u000d\u000a      China. Twin Creeks\u000d\u000a        Technologies believe that at 40 cents a watt, solar could quickly\u000d\u000a      become as profitable as\u000d\u000a      conventional fossil fuels.

In addition, over\u000d\u000a      the past 5 years\u000d\u000a      (2008-13) the IBC has provided ion beam facilities for 42 other Companies,\u000d\u000a      as well as 15 National\u000d\u000a      Centres and other publicly funded bodies.\u000d\u000a    DataFurnace is one of only 2 algorithms recognised by the International\u000d\u000a      Atomic Energy Agency\u000d\u000a      (IAEA) and is licensed to 23 laboratories world-wide. The IBC uses its\u000d\u000a      analysis techniques and\u000d\u000a      DataFurnace to work on a variety of problems which impinge on the economy\u000d\u000a      and society.

It is able to solve the inverse problem (\"given the\u000d\u000a      spectrum, what is the\u000d\u000a      profile\") automatically, without user intervention using Bayesian\u000d\u000a      inference and Markov chain\u000d\u000a      methods [1]. Recently the IBC has used DataFurnace to initiate work with\u000d\u000a      Forensic Laboratories,\u000d\u000a      Police and Home Office in the UK and in Europe [2].\u000d\u000a    In the mid 1990's, the IBC began work on silicon photonics, initiating\u000d\u000a      research on 03b2FeSi2 [3]\u000d\u000a      demonstrating light emission at 1.5 &#181;m and later combining this with\u000d\u000a      defect engineering to produce\u000d\u000a      efficient room temperature emission [4]. Devices are currently under test\u000d\u000a      for optically excited laser\u000d\u000a      structures and 2 patents on 1.3 &#181;m emitters &#8212; G centres and rare earth\u000d\u000a      sensitised long IR\u000d\u000a      wavelength detectors and emitters have been filed.

In January 2012 the\u000d\u000a      government\u000d\u000a      announced two new clinical centres using this technology (at a cost of\u000d\u000a      &#163;80M each).\u000d\u000a    With colleagues in Japan, the IBC has pioneered the development of a new\u000d\u000a      analytical technique,\u000d\u000a      MeV SIMS [6], for high molecular mass concentration maps in ambient\u000d\u000a      pressure conditions with\u000d\u000a      high spatial resolution. This is not currently possible using any other\u000d\u000a      technique. The IBC has also\u000d\u000a      pioneered the concept of \"Total IBA\", in which the full suite of Ion Beam\u000d\u000a      Analysis (IBA) techniques\u000d\u000a      (back-scattering, forward-scattering, X-ray and gamma-ray spectroscopies\u000d\u000a      etc.) is used\u000d\u000a      simultaneously to provide a single self-consistent view of a sample. The\u000d\u000a      DataFurnace was created\u000d\u000a      specifically to aid this process. The IBC also leads the world in high\u000d\u000a      precision backscattering\u000d\u000a      analysis, demonstrating a traceable precision of better than 1% in its\u000d\u000a      work. This underpinning\u000d\u000a      research on the analysis techniques has enabled the IBC to attract a large\u000d\u000a      number of projects from\u000d\u000a      around the world.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40548","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since the introduction of the GSM system as the global mobile\u000a      communication standard; communication security has been a major topic of\u000a      research by many organizations around the world. The GSM standard required\u000a      that all of the mobile phone functions were to be reversed at the edge of\u000a      the core network, which means that in order to have the encrypted speech\u000a      coming out of the mobile phone it must be decrypted at the edge of the\u000a      code network allowing eavesdropping on the conversation at the core\u000a      network. Therefore although the wireless link of the GSM (and the 3G)\u000a      system is fairly well protected, the end-to-end security is not\u000a      satisfactory due to the problems within the core network. The only way to\u000a      provide an end-to-end secure link is by enabling speech encryption before\u000a      the speech signal is input to the GSM network (or in the phone). However\u000a      if speech is encrypted before it enters the GSM phone, it will be treated\u000a      as random noise (assuming a good encryption system) and the GSM voice\u000a      activity detector will recognize it as noise and stop its transmission.\u000a    The technology developed in the I-Lab of University of Surrey converts\u000a      the encrypted speech into speech like waveforms which have nothing to do\u000a      with the original speech signal waveform, in such a way that it is able to\u000a      pass through the end-to-end GSM network with sufficient diversity. This\u000a      allows an end-to-end security which has never been possible before. This\u000a      technology is the first and the only one available in the world. In order\u000a      to improve the speech quality in multiple speaker and\/or noisy environment\u000a      a blind source separation preprocessing block has been added to the final\u000a      system which not only provides security but also works robustly under\u000a      varying ambient conditions.\u000a    Based on the Secure Voice Communications (SVC) technology, a University\u000a      of Surrey spin-off company, MulSys Limited, has been set-up which develops\u000a      the technology based on Surrey's research.\u000a    The technology is being licensed world-wide by MulSys both in software\u000a      and hardware form. This is the only available technology in the world\u000a      which uses the voice channel of the GSM and the 3G mobile communication\u000a      systems. The impact has been created since the company demonstrated the\u000a      system in the field with security agencies.\u000a    MulSys has already licensed the SVC technology to many government\u000a      security agencies (confidential information available on request)\u000a      receiving more than &#163;2.5M revenues to cover more than 5000 thousand units\u000a      and it is expected to reach 100k units in the next 3-5 years. The\u000a      licensing deals and the income generated from these sales have allowed\u000a      MulSys to grow into a multi-media communication systems company with no\u000a      need for additional venture capital support.\u000a    The phones developed are specialised\/customised and high cost. Due to\u000a      high demand from commercial and other sectors, MulSys is now producing its\u000a      own secure GSM\/3G phone to market worldwide. This phone is cheaper than\u000a      the customised security phones (by a factor of 4) operating over the data\u000a      channel currently on the market. MulSys is expected to capture &#163;15-20M\u000a      share of the total &#163;50-100M market value of secure GSM\/3G phones.\u000a    As there was no means of communicating securely over the GSM\/3G systems\u000a      especially where there is no data service, the MulSys SVC technology,\u000a      based on Surrey's research has offered the security organisations the\u000a      opportunity to conduct their daily activities with simple and effective\u000a      use of the SVC application to either lap-tops (for off-line messaging) and\u000a      mobile phones instantaneous secure communication anywhere in the world\u000a      where there is GSM\/3G coverage.\u000a    Due its exposure in the security market MulSys has grown its signal\u000a      processing coverage into various multimedia areas and has been invited\u000a      into several EU FP 7 projects which are used to develop new products in\u000a      the 3D content delivery area to fixed and mobile terminals.

They were thus bulky and expensive and only worked where the data\u000a      channel was available, which restricted use in critical parts of the\u000a      world.\u000a    The research work that led to the development of this unique technology\u000a      was conducted in the Surrey I-LAB. The technological solution not only\u000a      enables the encrypted speech to pass through the GSM\/3G low bit rate voice\u000a      coder but also allows the Voice Activity Detector (VAD) which cuts out\u000a      noise, to accurately recognise speech. Thus the encrypted speech is\u000a      processed in such a way that it passes through the low bit rate voice\u000a      channel with excellent accuracy and is correctly interpreted by the VAD as\u000a      speech. The knowledge gained from our GSM studies enabled the design of\u000a      specific speech like patterns (symbols) which when concatenated could form\u000a      a waveform sequence that passes through the GSM\/3G voice channel with\u000a      excellent accuracy. The distance (diversity) required between the selected\u000a      symbols for accurate detection at the receiver end determines the\u000a      throughput rate [1][2][3[4][5]. By using the voice channel, the secure\u000a      communication systems has fixed and short delay, connectivity everywhere\u000a      and can also transmit data with no need for additional data channel\u000a      subscription. There are also no roaming problems across international\u000a      borders.\u000a    No other organisation has been able to produce technology that would\u000a      enable secure communication through the GSM\/3G voice channel until now.\u000a      Thus they have been restricted to produce secure GSM phones which use the\u000a      CSD (circuit switch data) channel. However using the CSD channel raises a\u000a      number of issues. A major one is delay (as data is a secondary service,\u000a      networks may route the call in such a way that the delay can approach 2\u000a      seconds) rendering two way conversations impossible. Roaming (connecting\u000a      in various countries) has compatibility problems and system compatibility\u000a      issues (international calls can have problems when trunk networking) and\u000a      thus can only work in areas where there is a GSM data service, which\u000a      considerably restricts coverage. The MulSys solution developed at Surrey\u000a      avoids all of these problems.\u000a    The underpinning speech coder research work was initiated in 1993 and the\u000a      particular SVC research work was conducted during 2002-2006.\u000a    The main researcher was Professor Ahmet Kondoz who headed up Surrey's\u000a      I-Lab research group, including; Drs.

The GIOVE-A satellite, built at Surrey, was the first\u000a      satellite launched to provide navigation and timing signals for Galileo.\u000a    As a result of an innovative unsolicited proposal by SSTL to The European\u000a      Space Agenct (ESA), GIOVE-A was built in just 30 months against a hard\u000a      deadline and at a fraction of the competing industry cost, enabling Europe\u000a      to secure the rights to the key frequency bands critical to the operation\u000a      of Galileo over the coming decades. GIOVE-A provided the first\u000a      representative precise timing transmissions from its 22,000 km Earth\u000a      orbit, enabling European industry to start building and testing commercial\u000a      consumer products for this market estimated at &#163;90B.\u000a    By creating a credible and competitive alternative to a single European\u000a      consortium, SSTL both provided resilience and achieved dramatic cost\u000a      savings for the European tax-payer.\u000a    Europe's economy and security is now completely dependent upon\u000a      space-derived timing signals that are used to control our utilities, rail\u000a      networks, financial transactions, mobile phone networks and co-ordinate\u000a      complex manufacturing and distribution logistics, commercial and domestic\u000a      navigation services &#8212; and the ability to support military operations.\u000a      These signals are currently provided by the USAF military Global\u000a      Positioning System (GPS) and the loss or degradation of GPS signals would\u000a      have colossal economic and military impact on Europe. To provide adequate\u000a      independence and robustness of this critical infrastructure, Europe\u000a      committed to building its own timing constellation through the European\u000a      Commission (EC) and ESA. Galileo, intended for operation in 2008, was\u000a      beset by spiralling cost estimates and extended delays in implementation\u000a      that allowed competing systems (from China &amp; India) to argue for\u000a      rights to the frequency bands allocated to Europe for this service\u000a      alongside the GPS signals. If Europe could not launch and demonstrate\u000a      navigation signals from orbit by the regulatory deadline of June 2006,\u000a      their reservation of these critical frequency bands would expire and China\u000a      could lay claim to them for their competing system. This would have been\u000a      catastrophic for Europe's commercial and military independence.\u000a    In January 2004, ESA signed two contracts for the first Galileo\u000a      demonstration satellites &#8212; one with a consortium of European industries\u000a      and a second with SSTL &#8212; with a deadline of June 2006. Surrey's 600kg\u000a      GIOVE-A minisatellites was designed and built within a budget of just\u000a      &#8364;30M, making extensive use of the latest `COTS' electronic components to\u000a      achieve the very rapid manufacture time and high performance necessary &#8212;\u000a      and at a fraction of the cost. GIOVE-A was launched in December 2005 and\u000a      successfully generated the first European timing signals in January 2006,\u000a      five months ahead of the regulatory deadline, thus securing the\u000a      frequencies for Europe. GIOVE-A performed exceptionally well, providing\u000a      &gt;95% service availability and all of the mission goals had been fully\u000a      met by March 2008 when ESA declared GIOVE-A \"a full mission success\".\u000a      Despite its intended 27-month design lifetime, the satellite operated for\u000a      over 7 years, continuing to provide a useful test-bed to the European GNSS\u000a      and space environment communities. (NB. The competing industrial\u000a      consortium eventually launched their first satellite `GIOVE-B' in 2009,\u000a      over two years later and with a budget of ~&#8364;170M).\u000a    The real impact of the above was realised when a decision was taken by\u000a      the European Commission to procure the operational Galileo system (2008).\u000a      SSTL teamed with the German satellite builder OHB &#8212; System to offer the EC\u000a      a fully operational satellite constellation design based on an enhancement\u000a      of the GIOVE-A payload. Due to the success of the GIOVE-A mission and the\u000a      experience gained by Surrey, the SSTL-OHB team was awarded a contract for\u000a      14 operational satellites in January 2010 for &#8364;560M and, in a second\u000a      competition in February 2012, the EC awarded the SSTL-OHB team a further\u000a      &#8364;255M contract for 8 additional satellites &#8212; in both cases winning against\u000a      competitive bids by major European space companies.

The 600kg GIOVE-A satellite\u000a      was designed and built by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) the\u000a      University's spin-out company, working closely with Surrey researchers. As\u000a      a direct result of Surrey's underpinning research, it has operated\u000a      successfully in a hostile radiation orbit providing test and calibration\u000a      timing signals for over 7 years, greatly exceeding its 27-month design\u000a      lifetime. In 2010, the European Space Agency declared `complete mission\u000a      success' for GIOVE-A.\u000a    SSTL relied on the research carried out at Surrey's Space Centre to\u000a      design, build and operate the GIOVE-A satellite, specifically research\u000a      covering the modular mechanical structure, thermal models, power system,\u000a      on-board data handling system, S-band communications system, three-axis\u000a      attitude control system using reaction wheels and cold-gas propulsion,\u000a      electric-resistojet propulsion system for orbit manoeuvring, dynamic\u000a      control algorithms, and orbital astrodynamics models. Many of these\u000a      techniques and associated technologies using `commercial off-the-shelf\u000a      technologies (COTS) were first developed and then demonstrated\u000a      successfully in-orbit by Surrey on the UoSAT-12 minisatellite, built at\u000a      Surrey and launched in 2000, prior to being developed further by SSTL\u000a      specifically for the GIOVE-A mission.\u000a    The research at Surrey into GPS\/Galileo signal and timing structures,\u000a      codes, algorithms and associated receiver\/decoder circuits enabled SSTL to\u000a      design and build a second, independent, UK navigation payload providing\u000a      increased signal formation flexibility that was flown on GIOVE-A alongside\u000a      the primary payload supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA). This\u000a      research has also been exploited by SSTL to provide robust GNSS receivers\u000a      for use on-board satellites that enable autonomous orbit manoeuvres,\u000a      significantly increasing the efficiency of use of the limited on-board\u000a      fuel resources and reducing the cost of orbital operations. Prior to\u000a      GIOVE-A, a series of space GPS receivers were designed at Surrey and flown\u000a      in orbit on microsatellite and minisatellite missions to demonstrate and\u000a      evaluate their performance.\u000a    The GIOVE-A mission also could not have been successful without the\u000a      detailed knowledge gained from the long-term sustained programme of\u000a      research undertaken at Surrey's Space Centre into the effects of the harsh\u000a      space radiation environment on the design of both satellite platforms and\u000a      payloads &#8212; especially when using COTS devices originally designed for\u000a      terrestrial use.\u000a    Commencing in 1993 and sponsored by EPSRC, UK MoD, and the European Space\u000a      Agency (ESA), Surrey's research in radiation effects modelling, design of\u000a      instruments and in-orbit testing onboard over 30 SSTL-built satellites in\u000a      a wide range or orbits has created at Surrey the UK's centre-of-excellence\u000a      in the understanding and reliable use of COTS components in orbit. This\u000a      expertise, based on previous flight heritage and data from 10 cosmic\u000a      particle and trapped radiation effects monitoring instruments built by SSC\u000a      and flown in orbit on Surrey satellites between 1993 and 2006, specified\u000a      the design and manufacturing requirements for GIOVE-A to survive the\u000a      extreme radiation environment in its 22,000 km orbit and convince ESA that\u000a      SSTL's approach largely using commercially-manufactured components was\u000a      sound.\u000a    Research Team: Professor Sir M.N.Sweeting, Professor C.Underwood, Dr S.\u000a      Hodgart, Dr MJ Unwin, Dr P.Jales\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40550","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Society","Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A major success of the University of Surrey's cross disciplinary\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Transfer discovery programme was making the connection between\u000d\u000a      research in spacecraft control and its application to the acceleration of\u000d\u000a      animation software.\u000d\u000a    The technology embedded in IKinema represents a revolution in\u000d\u000a      computational efficiency and is the first really new advance in the field\u000d\u000a      of animation for many years.

The new\u000d\u000a      method is a computationally efficient numerical tool that solves the\u000d\u000a      inverse mapping problem, also known as the inverse kinematics problem.\u000d\u000a    Surrey's new method vastly reduces the time it takes to compute the\u000d\u000a      solution and as a result more degrees of freedom (hence more complex\u000d\u000a      systems) can be handled in real-time. Computational complexity in previous\u000d\u000a      solutions increased to the power 3 with increasing degrees of freedom\u000d\u000a      whereas the new solution increases linearly with increases in the degrees\u000d\u000a      of freedom. Real-time computer animation for games and virtual\u000d\u000a      environments was a logical first step to commercialise the findings due to\u000d\u000a      the necessity for solving highly complex systems in real-time and the size\u000d\u000a      of the commercial market. The algorithm can potentially also be applied to\u000d\u000a      the problem of protein folding for fast drug design, an area that is still\u000d\u000a      to be explored.\u000d\u000a    The research findings have been considered novel by the research\u000d\u000a      community and, quite independently, the step change that the solution\u000d\u000a      offers in both the robotics control area and the area of spacecraft\u000d\u000a      control received these very encouraging comments:\u000d\u000a    The author presents an insightful take on the singularity avoidance\u000d\u000a        problem for CMG steering.

For\u000d\u000a      example, the DMC provided the first comprehensive coverage of the Asian\u000d\u000a      Tsunami disaster in 2004 on which the UN based their early recovery plans\u000d\u000a      and provided the first images of the Katrina hurricane disaster to US\u000d\u000a      authorities.\u000d\u000a    The DMC satellites are also used to provide scientific information on\u000d\u000a      land and water resources, agriculture, pollution, urban development and\u000d\u000a      especially deforestation &#8212; the DMC, for example, was used extensively in\u000d\u000a      the preparations for the Beijing Olympics and in providing annual\u000d\u000a      assessments of deforestation and illegal logging in the Amazon basin rain\u000d\u000a      forest.\u000d\u000a    By dramatically lowering the cost of sophisticated EO satellites, Surrey\u000d\u000a      has enabled 15 nations to develop their own space activities and form\u000d\u000a      space agencies (Surrey has trained the nucleus of 6 new space agencies)\u000d\u000a      and achieve their own independent ability to image from space, better to\u000d\u000a      manage their national resources and security and to be able participate\u000d\u000a      more fully in international affairs. The DMC concept pioneered by Surrey\u000d\u000a      has been recognised internationally and the concept has since been\u000d\u000a      emulated by China, Japan and France.\u000d\u000a    The DMC satellites provide more data than is needed purely for disaster\u000d\u000a      monitoring and national use, and so DMCii has supplied data to the\u000d\u000a      commercial EO data marketplace generating revenues of over &#163;10M that has\u000d\u000a      been used to build and launch replacement satellites in the constellation.\u000d\u000a      DMCii is the vehicle that has created impact post 2008.\u000d\u000a    The imagery generated from the DMC satellites is a significant commercial\u000d\u000a      and economic success. Over &#163;5 million of DMC imagery is sold in over 30\u000d\u000a      countries for governmental and commercial use in agriculture, National\u000d\u000a      Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), forest monitoring, disaster\u000d\u000a      planning\/management, and land cover mapping. This commercial success\u000d\u000a      enabled DMCii to commission a new satellite (UK-DMC2) from SSTL in 2010\u000d\u000a      that was financed wholly within the SSTL group: a world 1st for a\u000d\u000a      commercial EO satellite. In 2012, by creating a novel `DMC-3 leased\u000d\u000a      imaging capacity service', DMCii won a &#163;115M, 7-year contract to provide\u000d\u000a      high resolution EO image data to China. In 2013, based upon the latest\u000d\u000a      developments from SSC research into small satellite platforms and imaging\u000d\u000a      techniques, SSTL is building a new high capacity EO microsatellite (funded\u000d\u000a      from DMCii revenues) that will form a constellation that will image the\u000d\u000a      whole of the Earth's land surface every 24 hours to provide a unique\u000d\u000a      database for a wide range of change detection applications.\u000d\u000a    For the last 7 years farmers in the US and Europe have relied on DMC\u000d\u000a      imagery to generate precision farming services to determine the best time\u000d\u000a      and place to apply fertilizer on their fields. Before the DMC it was\u000d\u000a      impossible for these services to achieve the scale and frequency of\u000d\u000a      national observations required to mitigate cloud visibility for successful\u000d\u000a      commercial operations.

Recent analysis of the\u000d\u000a      UK DMC-2 satellite image data by NOAA (USA) gave it a quality rating of\u000d\u000a      81% compared to LANDSAT's 69% in the same bands.\u000d\u000a    DMCii, using data from the DMC satellites, is heavily engaged in\u000d\u000a      monitoring deforestation and illegal logging activities. The Brazilian\u000d\u000a      government has relied heavily on DMC satellite imagery to provide the\u000d\u000a      annual Amazon basin deforestation assessment. In 2012 a &#163;2.1M contract was\u000d\u000a      signed with DMCii enabling Brazil to access imagery directly from UK-DMC2\u000d\u000a      satellite from its ground station to image the entire Amazon basin every\u000d\u000a      two weeks, enhancing the ability to identify deforestation at an early\u000d\u000a      stage and alert the authorities when logging is detected.

SSC and DMCii are now\u000d\u000a      recognised as world-class experts in satellite imager calibration.\u000d\u000a    The DMC could not have been successful without the detailed knowledge\u000d\u000a      gained from the long-term sustained programme of Surrey's research into\u000d\u000a      the effects of the harsh space radiation environment on the design of both\u000d\u000a      satellite platforms and payloads &#8212; especially when using COTS devices\u000d\u000a      originally designed for terrestrial use. Commencing in 1993 and sponsored\u000d\u000a      by EPSRC, UK MoD, and ESA, SSC's research in radiation effects modelling,\u000d\u000a      the design of instruments and in-orbit testing onboard over 30 SSTL-built\u000d\u000a      satellites in a wide range or orbits has created at Surrey the UK's\u000d\u000a      centre-of-excellence in the understanding and reliable use of COTS\u000d\u000a      components in orbit. This expertise, based on previous flight heritage and\u000d\u000a      data from 10 cosmic particle and trapped radiation effects monitoring\u000d\u000a      instruments built by SSC and flown in orbit on 23 Surrey satellites to\u000d\u000a      date, specified the SSTL's design and manufacturing requirements for the\u000d\u000a      DMC satellites to survive the orbital radiation environment.\u000d\u000a    Research Team: M.N.Sweeting, C.I.Underwood; S.Mackin; T.Vladimirova;\u000d\u000a      A.Pechev; M.Fouquet; J.W.Ward; H.Steyn\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41137","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In the years since its formation, Senceive Ltd has established itself as\u000a      the preferred provider of wireless remote condition monitoring for\u000a      geotechnical and railway projects in the UK, leading to significant commercial\u000a        benefits for both Senceive and its customers. The company's Flatmesh\u000a      product range &#8212; launched in May 2009 and based upon UCL-developed wireless\u000a      mesh technology &#8212; provides a highly robust, reliable and easy-to-deploy\u000a      asset monitoring solution. Flatmesh enables the owners of\u000a        geotechnical, rail and construction infrastructure to accurately and\u000a        efficiently monitor their highly valuable and often difficult to access\u000a        assets and in a manner which is significantly more cost-effective\u000a      compared to alternatives such as manual monitoring, wired solutions or\u000a      emerging technologies such as fibre optics. The innovative nature of the\u000a      Senceive monitoring solution has been widely recognised, with for example\u000a      a high-profile Tunnelling product innovation award being secured in\u000a      November 2012 [a].\u000a    The impact of adopting the Senceive solution for monitoring projects is\u000a      illustrated through a 2011 deployment at Bond Street underground station\u000a      [b], which was undergoing a &#163;300m major redevelopment with the objective\u000a      of increasing capacity, improving accessibility and creating an\u000a      interchange with Crossrail. In the design phase of the project, a need was\u000a      identified for grouting works to be undertaken in voids that had formed\u000a      around the Jubilee Line tunnel linings in order to stabilise the tunnels\u000a      prior to commencement of the station reconstruction works. Early in the\u000a      project, it became clear that a highly flexible, safe and reliable system\u000a      to monitor movement within existing tunnels during the grouting works was\u000a      needed, given the risks to personnel and tunnelling infrastructure if\u000a      attempts were made to pump significant amounts of excess grout into the\u000a      voids. A solution was delivered which utilised Senceive's high-resolution\u000a      wireless tilt meters mounted on tunnel lining segments using novel\u000a      magnetic fixings, with individual rotational and linear equivalent\u000a      movements being displayed on Senceive's Webmonitor software. Halcrow's\u000a      Associate Director Tunnels said of the project: \"There was simply no\u000a      credible solution other than that developed with Senceive. The system\u000a        made significant savings to the cost of the works, which would have\u000a      been much more labour-intensive, time-consuming and slower if a\u000a      mechanically fixed wired solution had been used\" [c]. Tunnelling Journal\u000a      estimates that the Senceive solution saved an estimated &#163;1 million\u000a      compared to conventional techniques [d]. The Innovation Director at\u000a      Costain, another partner on the project, said: \"Remote monitoring is an\u000a      important service we are providing to our customers. It reduces costs\u000a      compared to traditional methods and allows our teams to remotely\u000a        monitor assets safely during construction and through the life of\u000a      the asset. Remote monitoring is all about providing intelligent solutions\u000a      to our customers to enhance their business performance and reducing\u000a        the cost of infrastructure delivery. We are pleased to be able to\u000a      support Senceive to bring innovation to make our delivery more efficient\"\u000a      [c].\u000a    More recent deployments include a major tunnel re-lining project in\u000a      2012\/13 on the Jubilee Line between Bond St and Baker St, where Senceive\u000a      was retained directly by Tubelines due to the company's unique ability to\u000a      satisfy the challenging project-monitoring requirements imposed by\u000a      remedial works that needed to be undertaken efficiently during limited\u000a      periods (i.e. evenings and selected weekends) when trains did not run. The\u000a      problem that Senceive was assisting in resolving was covered by BBC News\u000a      [e] and in respect of the Senceive solution, the Lead Tunnel Engineer at\u000a      Tubelines said: \"Flatmesh and its enhanced integrated communications hub\u000a      is an innovative, unique and appropriate combination of leading-edge\u000a      technologies, developed by Senceive and specifically adapted for\u000a      tunnelling applications. It offers the opportunity for a \"totally\u000a      wire-free solution\" from tunnel to surface for challenging short- and\u000a      long-term engineering works for which there is no credible existing\u000a        alternative\" [f].\u000a    In addition since 2012, Amey has used Senceive's solutions on an\u000a      increasing number of sites to deliver a structural monitoring capability\u000a      for their UK-wide Civil Examination Framework Agreement (CEFA) contract\u000a      for Network Rail. [text removed for publication]. Finally, in July 2013,\u000a      Senceive secured a major contract with Canary Wharf Contractors to provide\u000a      an underground tunnel monitoring system on the Northern and Bakerloo\u000a      Lines, as part of the Shell Centre re-development project taking place on\u000a      London's South Bank. The significance of this contract was that Senceive's\u000a        solution displaced competing monitoring approaches ranging from\u000a      laser-based electronic theodolites (feasibility issues due to space\u000a      constraints), fibre-optics (expensive and unproven) and wired solutions\u000a      (expensive and inflexible) [h] and thus provided strong and timely\u000a      evidence of the impacts that wireless monitoring can deliver to the\u000a      geotechnical and railway industries.\u000a    The overall commercial opportunity that Senceive is addressing in the\u000a      rail and construction markets is of significant economic importance, with\u000a      the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) estimating that the UK alone will\u000a      spend around &#163;50 billion per annum until 2030 [i] to address historic\u000a      underinvestment, deliver new projects such as HS2 and transition to a\u000a      low-carbon economy. The utilisation of Senceive's wireless remote asset\u000a      monitoring platform by supply chain partners such as Amey, Costain,\u000a      Balfour Beatty Rail and Getec (part of the Keller Group) enables\u000a        companies to secure significant competitive advantages when\u000a      tendering for construction and maintenance contracts at home and overseas.\u000a      More broadly, wireless sensor network technologies remain an area of\u000a      significant commercial interest, with market research reports (e.g.\u000a      IDTechEx [j]) predicting that the market for wireless sensor network\u000a      solutions will grow from around $0.45 billion in 2011 to around $2 billion\u000a      by 2021.\u000a    Finally from an economic impact perspective, Senceive is a small\u000a      but increasingly important contributor to the growth of the\u000a      knowledge-based economy in London. The company has achieved its success\u000a      after a relatively modest investment, having raised &#163;450,000 of seed\u000a      investment together with grants from the London Development Agency &amp;\u000a      Technology Strategy Board of &#163;220,000 during the REF impact period.\u000a      Company turnover has risen consistently over the past three years, with\u000a      the year to 31 July 2013 generating revenues in excess of &#163;600,000 (a\u000a      four-fold increase on 2012), whilst from an employment perspective, the\u000a      company currently employs eight graduate or higher level staff (2 in 2007)\u000a      from offices located in Putney, London [h].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UCL spinout company, Senceive Ltd, has established itself as an\u000a      innovative provider of wireless enabled remote condition monitoring\u000a      solutions.

It arose as part of a Department of Trade and Industry\u000a      (DTI)-funded project entitled SECOAS (Self-Organising Collegiate Sensor\u000a      Networks) in which UCL was a participant along with industrial partners BT\u000a      Exact PLC, Intelisys Ltd and Plextek Ltd, and the Universities of Essex\u000a      and East Anglia. The objectives of the project [1, 2] were to demonstrate\u000a      how a distributed network of smart sensors could be configured through the\u000a      development of decentralised algorithms, such that the resulting sensor\u000a      network would automatically adapt to failures, upgrades and requirement\u000a      changes. Importantly, practical validation of the resulting technology\u000a      took place through a trial deployment at the Scroby Sands wind farm\u000a      located off the Norfolk coast.\u000a    UCL's significant contribution to the SECOAS project was the development\u000a      of an Integration Service Layer (ISL), which consisted of a lightweight\u000a      operating system and modules for interfacing between the sensors,\u000a      communications layers and processing systems that reside on each wireless\u000a      node. Figure 1 illustrates schematically the basic approach, where sensor\u000a      components, supported by microcontroller-based devices, are networked and\u000a      managed to form a system capable of performing remote asset monitoring. It\u000a      used design rules inspired by biological automata or agents which interact\u000a      with their neighbours via simple rules whilst also co-operating with a\u000a      large number of individuals to perform complex global tasks; the basis of\u000a      these concepts were presented at the premier sensor networks venue in 2005\u000a      [3, 4]. This was crucial to the resulting mesh-network communications\u000a      architecture being both highly robust to the changes in topology that\u000a      could occur due to node failures, obstacles placed in radio paths and\u000a      varying weather conditions, and extremely scalable. The use of distributed\u000a      approaches to network management [2, 3] enabled each node in the\u000a      mesh-network architecture to be truly self-organising and autonomous, and\u000a      as a result, avoided installation complexities arising from the use of\u000a      explicit routing nodes in wireless monitoring approaches based upon Zigbee\u000a      (IEEE 802.15.4) communication protocols. By the conclusion of the project,\u000a      the SECOAS project partners had demonstrated [5] that it was feasible to\u000a      combine the UCL ISL with cheap off-the-shelf hardware and software\u000a      components in order to provide a wireless-enabled asset-monitoring\u000a      solution that had potential for use in environmental and industrial\u000a      monitoring applications.\u000a    The translational objectives of the DTI's Next Wave programme funding\u000a      also resulted in a series of market assessment activities being undertaken\u000a      as the project team sought to understand the commercial potential of the\u000a      project's research outputs. These activities indicated that owners of\u000a      rail, utility and industrial infrastructure were seeking to monitor the\u000a      state of their assets in a more efficient and robust manner. For example,\u000a      Sir Ian McAllister (then Chairman of Network Rail) cited that his\u000a      organisation was investing tens of millions of pounds in `intelligent\u000a      infrastructure' programmes, as they sought to deliver effective predictive\u000a      maintenance programmes that would enable railway operators to be informed\u000a      when problems with often ageing and remote assets were likely to occur,\u000a      and thus enable better planning for future investment. Resulting benefits\u000a      would include the ability to maintain high availability of transportation\u000a      networks, a reduction in operational problems, delays and associated\u000a      economic consequences, and also increased safety both for passengers and\u000a      railway workers. Back in 2005, wireless-enabled remote condition\u000a      monitoring technologies showed promise, but a limiting factor to adoption\u000a      was that the solutions needed to be robust, scalable and cost-effective in\u000a      line with expectations of users who were highly conscious of safety and\u000a      reliability. With the early prototypes of the UCL technology satisfying\u000a      such requirements, the decision was made to commercially exploit the UCL\u000a      technology through the creation of a spinout company, Senceive Ltd, which\u000a      was founded in November 2005. In January 2006, Dr Britton became a\u000a      full-time employee of Senceive in order to assist in the translation of\u000a      the UCL technology into a commercial product, whilst Dr Sacks provided\u000a      consultancy support to the company post-incorporation.\u000a\u000aFigure 1: The four layers of the UCL system: (i) sensor components, (ii) the software, operating\u000asystem and microcontroller unit (MCU); (iii) radio and network control and management system;\u000aand (iv) the operational support system, administration, provision and maintenance.

The impact of his work on industry can be\u000d\u000a      quantified from two main vantage points: technical and economic. The\u000d\u000a      technology relying on linear and nonlinear MPC is used for improving\u000d\u000a      process performance, environmental impact and reliable operation.\u000d\u000a    The impact of Mayne's MPC research includes a number of industrial cases\u000d\u000a      of success. In the following five success stories in two multinational\u000d\u000a      companies, Honeywell and ABB, nonlinear MPC was the essential (or\u000d\u000a      fundamental) component. In addition, direct reference to the company\u000d\u000a      pioneering the introduction of MPC in the specific sector during the\u000d\u000a      current REF period is made.\u000d\u000a    &#8226; Honeywell &#8212; The impact of Mayne's research to Honeywell's\u000d\u000a      advanced control technology is evidenced by their testimony [E1]:\u000d\u000a    \".... Professor Mayne has introduced several significant advances in\u000d\u000a        the area, especially in the extension of MPC to nonlinear systems.\"\u000d\u000a      They also stated that Professor Mayne's contributions in nonlinear MPC \"...\u000a        has had the greatest impact on (our) industrial practice.\"\u000d\u000a    Honeywell specifically cited three areas of their operations in which\u000d\u000a      Mayne's MPC research work has been applied [E1]:\u000d\u000a    1) Ethylene production [E1, E2]: Ethylene is one of the\u000d\u000a      largest-volume industrial bulk commodity in the world. The majority of\u000d\u000a      ethylene is used in the production of ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride,\u000d\u000a      ethyl-benzene, and a variety of plastics ranging from plastic food wrap to\u000d\u000a      impact-absorbing dashboards inside cars. Honeywell assisted Basell\u000d\u000a      Polyolefins GmbH, the world's largest producer of polypropylene (PP) and\u000d\u000a      advanced polyolefins products, in the implementation of nonlinear MPC\u000d\u000a      solutions to maximize profits from their ethylene plant. This\u000d\u000a      implementation has resulted, starting from 2008, in these key benefits: a)\u000d\u000a      substantial economic benefits, including \".. millions of dollars from\u000d\u000a        increase production annually\" [E1]; b) improved quality control on\u000d\u000a      key units as a result of reduced control-variable standard deviations\u000d\u000a      (including a 52% reduction in standard deviation of top quality on the\u000d\u000a      PP-Splitter and 58% reduction in standard deviation of bottoms quality on\u000d\u000a      the PP-Splitter) [E2]; c) increased uptime: Basell has achieved an\u000d\u000a      Advanced Process Control online time in excess of 90% [E2].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    2) Power plants [E1, E3]: Fuel costs, energy conversion\u000d\u000a      efficiency, and environmental impacts of fossil-fuelled plants have become\u000d\u000a      priorities in both developed and developing countries. Since 2008, the\u000d\u000a      Honeywell MPC tool has been particularly effective in the operation of\u000d\u000a      power plants [E1]. As a significant example, the deployment of a MPC-\u000d\u000a      based tool in the JinShan power plant (China) has enabled Sinopec to\u000d\u000a      increase the boiler efficiency by 0.5%, to increase the operating steam\u000d\u000a      temperature by 2.8&#176;C and to improve stability of key combustion process\u000d\u000a      variables. In addition, the air pollutant emissions from the fuel and\u000d\u000a      limestone consumption have been decreased to comply with environmental\u000d\u000a      standards in the region. The reductions in coal and coke consumption are\u000d\u000a      500 tons and 1,700 tons per annum. [E3]\u000d\u000a    3) Automotive Powertrains [E4]: Automotive engines are highly\u000d\u000a      nonlinear plants with significant model uncertainty due to production\u000d\u000a      variability and ageing. At the same time the control must satisfy both\u000d\u000a      input and output constraints. Honeywell developed a fully functional\u000d\u000a      nonlinear MPC-based controller that can be deployed on an engine in 2-3\u000d\u000a      weeks of engine test time, and with superior performance, as contrasted\u000d\u000a      with the performance achieved via several months required for traditional\u000d\u000a      techniques [E4]. Based on this technology, they have established a new\u000d\u000a      business division based around their OnRAMP design suite for automotive\u000d\u000a      powertrains (http:\/\/www.honeywellonramp.com).\u000d\u000a    &#8226; ABB &#8212; ABB is another company where the successes of MPC for\u000d\u000a      industrial applications are amply demonstrated [E5]. Based on their\u000d\u000a      cpmPlus Expert Optimizer, an advanced process optimization product, they\u000d\u000a      have successfully used MPC in a number of manufacturing systems. Two\u000d\u000a      examples are cited [E5]:\u000d\u000a    4) Cement Manufacturing [E5, E6]: The cement industry of the 21st\u000d\u000a      century is confronted with disparate goals that at first glance seem to\u000d\u000a      conflict. For example, there is enormous pressure to increase profit and\u000d\u000a      margins, while at the same time there is considerable public interest in\u000d\u000a      the sustainable and environmentally friendly use of natural resources. In\u000d\u000a      other words, plant operators find themselves in a situation where they\u000d\u000a      need to react fast and optimally to continuously changing conditions while\u000d\u000a      still meeting various and probably conflicting objectives. MPC-based\u000d\u000a      feedback operates the plants to their optimal economic performance within\u000d\u000a      the technological, environmental, and contractual constraints. ABB has\u000d\u000a      installed MPC on-line optimizers in the Untervaz material blending plant\u000d\u000a      (Switzerland). Starting from 2008, the benefits achieved by the\u000d\u000a      installation are reduction by 20% of raw mix quality variability and\u000d\u000a      reduced kiln process variability. The nonlinear MPC-based optimizer has\u000d\u000a      been also installed in the Holcim's L&#228;gerdorf precalciner for temperature\u000d\u000a      control (Germany), and Buzzi's Guidonis cements grinding system (Italy).\u000d\u000a    5) Coal-Fired Power Plants [E7]: Renewable energy sources have\u000d\u000a      pushed conventional power plants to be more flexible and efficient. This\u000d\u000a      has led to coal-fired power plants needing to have efficient boiler\u000d\u000a      start-up mechanisms. ABB has successfully developed, commercialised and\u000d\u000a      deployed numerous nonlinear model-predictive optimization solutions for\u000d\u000a      boiler start-up in power plants [E7]. The complex dynamics of the boiler\u000d\u000a      start-up mechanism are described by a nonlinear model subject to numerous\u000d\u000a      constraints on energy usage and thermal stress. The ABB solution based on\u000d\u000a      nonlinear MPC implementation has successfully shown to be able to solve\u000d\u000a      the boiler start-up problem nearly optimally. On average, the energy\u000d\u000a      savings per start-up are around 15%, while starting up is much faster than\u000d\u000a      with standard procedures [E5].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a controller design methodology\u000d\u000a      involving on-line dynamic optimisation of a user-defined objective.

The most significant\u000d\u000a      contribution of Model Predictive Control (MPC) resides in the construction\u000d\u000a      of a feedback mechanism which approximately, and in real-time, optimizes\u000d\u000a      process operation, while satisfying operational constraints. These goals\u000d\u000a      cannot be achieved by any other control mechanisms. The underpinning\u000d\u000a      research in MPC at Imperial was conducted in the EEE Department by\u000d\u000a      Professor D.Q. Mayne. He has pioneered a number of research breakthroughs\u000d\u000a      in the analysis, design and development of both linear and nonlinear MPC,\u000d\u000a      which have resulted in him being awarded the prestigious \"I EEE Control\u000d\u000a      Systems Award\" (http:\/\/www.ieee.org\/about\/awards\/bios\/controlsys_recipients.html)\u000d\u000a      and the IFAC Quazza Medal (http:\/\/www.ifac-control.org\/awards\/major-medals).\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research in MPC by Mayne and his team are:\u000d\u000a    1. Receding horizon control [R1, R2] - In receding horizon\u000d\u000a      control the current control is determined by solving on-line a constrained\u000d\u000a      open-loop optimal control problem and applying this control over the\u000d\u000a      following sampling interval after which this procedure is repeated. It is\u000d\u000a      thus able to handle hard constraints on controls and states: this property\u000d\u000a      is one of its main advantages and the cornerstone of the stability\u000d\u000a      properties of MPC controlled nonlinear processes.\u000d\u000a    Since in large-scale applications on-line solution of nonlinear optimal\u000d\u000a      control problems may be impractical, Mayne provided a practical\u000d\u000a      alternative: sub-optimal MPC that ensures closed-loop stability even if\u000d\u000a      the optimal control problem is not solved exactly [R1]. Subsequently, the\u000d\u000a      ambitious task of evaluating systematically the stability and optimality\u000d\u000a      properties of MPC methods was presented in his 2000 paper [R2]. The paper\u000d\u000a      provides a rigorous analysis of solved problems and a lucid description of\u000d\u000a      open problems in MPC. As stated in [R2]:\u000d\u000a    ``We distill ..... essential principles that ensure stability and use\u000d\u000a        these to present a concise characterization of most of the model\u000d\u000a        predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In\u000d\u000a        some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is\u000d\u000a        exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in\u000d\u000a        other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal\u000d\u000a        control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite\u000d\u000a        horizon optimal control accrue.''\u000d\u000a    After its publication in 2000, this paper has become the most widely\u000d\u000a      cited MPC paper and was recognized in 2011 by the first IFAC High Impact\u000d\u000a      Paper Award (http:\/\/www.ifac-control.org\/awards\/major-medals).\u000d\u000a    2.

Subsequently, Microsaic developed a set of micro-engineering\u000a      innovations [e.g.\u000a      E1] that enabled the launch of the world's first commercial compact mass\u000a      spectrometer\u000a      for liquid analysis, the MiD, in 2011. Microsaic has over 40 granted\u000a      patents, of which the\u000a      substantial majority are based wholly or in part on research carried out\u000a      in the EEE\u000a      department by the founders.\u000a    Mass spectrometry (MS) is the \"gold standard\" method for identifying the\u000a      constituents in\u000a      a sample, and is used in an enormous range of applications including drug\u000a      development\u000a      and production, forensics, food and drink analysis, security, water\u000a      quality and many\u000a      others. However, although MS is a $7B market, the size, cost and\u000a      complexity of MS\u000a      instruments greatly restrict their deployment, so MS is generally provided\u000a      in analytical\u000a      laboratories, to which users must bring their samples. The Microsaic\u000a      system is the size\u000a      of a desktop PC, has no external pumps or other peripherals, and thus can\u000a      be deployed\u000a      much more widely. For example, thousands of chemists work routinely with\u000a      chromatographic separation methods such as HPLC (high performance liquid\u000a      chromatography) in the development, synthesis, purification and production\u000a      of drugs and\u000a      other chemicals. Typically they have their own HPLC equipment, but to\u000a      definitively\u000a      assess their samples they use a central MS facility. Microsaic has made it\u000a      practical for\u000a      each HPLC station to include mass spectrometry. The MiD also benefits from\u000a      much\u000a      lower power, gas and solvent consumption than conventional MS instruments.\u000a    Quadrupole mass spectrometers work by ionising the molecules in the\u000a      sample, and then\u000a      \"flying\" the ions in a vacuum chamber through a mass filter, which uses\u000a      electric fields to\u000a      separate them by mass-to-charge ratio, directing the selected mass onto a\u000a      detector. To\u000a      make miniaturisation possible, Microsaic developed three micro-engineered\u000a      components: the miniature quadrupole filter itself, an electrospray\u000a      ionisation source, and\u000a      a vacuum interface chip for bringing ions into the vacuum system. All are\u000a      based on\u000a      Imperial's research [R2, R3].\u000a    Microsaic's 3500 MiD was launched at a major US trade fair, Lab\u000a      Automation, where it\u000a      won a prestigious New Product Award. In 2012 the 3500 MiD won an R&amp;D\u000a      100 award as\u000a      one of the major technological innovations of the year. Initial systems\u000a      were purchased by\u000a      a number of major pharmaceutical companies and university labs in the\u000a      first year of the\u000a      product's release, and these quickly led to new methods being adopted in\u000a      those labs.\u000a      For example, Merck &amp; Co Inc, in collaboration with Microsaic and\u000a      Imperial College,\u000a      published the first demonstration of the use of a miniature MS with HPLC\u000a      [E2].\u000a      Subsequently, Cambridge University researchers applied Microsaic's compact\u000a      MS to\u000a      continuous reaction monitoring, and showed that the use of an on-line mass\u000a      spectrometer \"enabled the flow conditions to be quickly tuned for safe\u000a        operation and\u000a        optimal generation of the desired product\", and \"paves the way to\u000a        discovering untapped\u000a        synthesis methods\" [E3].\u000a    In May 2012 Microsaic announced a contract with Biotage AB, a major\u000a      supplier of flash\u000a      chromatography equipment, to supply a minimum of 50 MS instruments per\u000a      year,\u000a      rebadged as the Isolera Dalton Mass Detector, as part of a combined\u000a      MS-flash system.\u000a      This system was launched by Biotage in April 2013. The system identifies\u000a      compounds by\u000a      mass in real time during flash separation, \"leading to greater\u000a        confidence in purification\u000a        and a significant saving in time and money. This combination of\u000a        identification and\u000a        purification removes complex off-line analytical steps..., vastly\u000a        increasing throughput and\u000a        putting the entire purification and analysis in the hands of the chemist\"\u000a      [E4]. Microsaic\u000a      was listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM) in April 2011. It employs\u000a      over 35\u000a      people, has a market capitalisation of &#163;23.4M (on 21\/10\/13) and has raised\u000a      a further\u000a      &#163;11M in equity funding.\u000a    I2) Nanostructured silicon anode materials for lithium batteries\u000a      &#8212; The research group's\u000a      other innovation in microstructured silicon that led to a new company was\u000a      high capacity\u000a      anodes for lithium batteries based on \"natural\" lithography [R4]. Initial\u000a      proof of concept\u000a      research by Prof. M Green gave a clear indication that this technology\u000a      could provide\u000a      substantial enhancement to battery capacity, while being scaleable to\u000a      production\u000a      volumes at reasonable cost [R5]. As a result the company Nexeon Ltd was\u000a      established\u000a      in 2006 [E5]. Between 2009 and 2011 Nexeon attracted over &#163;50M in\u000a      investment funds,\u000a      which it has employed to develop and scale up the technology. It is one of\u000a      the \"top three\u000a      portfolio companies\" [E6] of Imperial Innovations plc, which itself has a\u000a      market cap. of\u000a      &#163;256M (6\/10\/13). Nexeon has won a number of awards in the Clean Tech\u000a      sector,\u000a      including the Rushlight Award for Energy Efficiency in 2013 [E7], a\u000a      Climate Week Award\u000a      in the Best Technological Breakthrough category (2012), and has been named\u000a      twice in\u000a      the Global Cleantech 100 list (2011 and 2012). It has \"signed a\u000a        development agreement\u000a        with a major consumer electronics and battery OEM\" (2012) [E6] and \"completed\u000a        a\u000a        strategic deal with WACKER Chemie AG to provide access to engineering\u000a        expertise for\u000a        the design and construction of a 250 tonne per annum plant\" (2013)\u000a      [E6].\u000a    I3) NASA's Pheonix Mars Mission &#8212; The external impact of the\u000a      group's microengineering\u000a      research has not only been through commercialisation of its technology.\u000a      One example is the\u000a      work of Prof. Tom Pike and colleagues on microstructured substrates for\u000a      soil analysis [R6],\u000a      which led to these substrates being included as part of the atomic force\u000a      microscopy\u000a      instrument on the 2008 NASA Phoenix mission to Mars [E8,E9]. The mission,\u000a      and the\u000a      microscopic analysis of the Martian soil, were successful, and added\u000a      important evidence in\u000a      the ongoing quest to investigate the possibility of life on Mars, by\u000a      assessing the exposure of\u000a      soil samples to liquid water [E8]. These results generated considerable\u000a      public interest and\u000a      media coverage [E9] and provided the context for the NASA's subsequent\u000a      2012 Mars\u000a      Science Laboratory mission [Science articles citing E9]. A\u000a      micro-seismometer based on the\u000a      group's 3D silicon micromachining technology has also been chosen for\u000a      inclusion in the\u000a      forthcoming 2016 Insight Mission to Mars, where the Imperial group is the\u000a      only team from\u000a      the UK included in this multinational project led by NASA [E10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Optical and Semiconductor Devices group led by Richard Syms has been\u000a      a major innovator\u000a      in fabrication methods for 3D silicon microstructures, and has developed a\u000a      wide range of novel\u000a      devices and techniques based on these innovations.

MEMS uses methods\u000a      from integrated circuit technology to develop devices with optical,\u000a      mechanical, fluidic and other\u000a      functions, but is restricted by the largely 2-dimensional nature of IC\u000a      processing. From the\u000a      beginning, Syms' group focused on developing methods to make 3D\u000a      microstructures. Their\u000a      first major contribution was the surface tension self-assembly method\u000a      (1995) [R1], which\u000a      allows batch fabrication of 3D structures &#8212; such as optical scanners and\u000a      inductors for high\u000a      frequency circuits on silicon &#8212; by rotating lithographically defined 2D\u000a      parts. Other devices\u000a      developed by the group included the first microengineered circuit breaker\u000a      (2004), and radio\u000a      frequency switches (2006).\u000a    The group's emphasis on 3D microengineering extended to other techniques\u000a      such as\u000a      precision optical fibre alignment. In 1995 Syms began a project to\u000a      miniaturise quadrupole\u000a      mass spectrometers (QMS). The use of silicon alignment structures for the\u000a      quadrupole rods,\u000a      adapted from the fibre alignment methods, was a breakthrough that allowed\u000a      the Imperial team\u000a      to develop the world's first microengineered QMS (1996) [R2]. Other\u000a      developments drawing\u000a      heavily on 3D structuring included a self-aligned electrospray ion gun\u000a      (2005) [R3], the basis of\u000a      an electrospray mass spectrometer. Research was supported initially by two\u000a      EPSRC projects\u000a      and later by DTI\/LINK in collaboration with the pharmaceutical company\u000a      GSK. The latter\u000a      project resulted in the realization in microengineered form of three major\u000a      building blocks\u000a      needed to construct a compact mass spectrometer for life science\u000a      applications: a spray\u000a      source, a vacuum interface, and a high-performance mass analyser.\u000a    Another technique pioneered by the group for 3D structures involves the\u000a      use of natural resist,\u000a      a method by which thin films \"ripen\" into sub-micron islands, which then\u000a      act as masks for deep\u000a      etch processes to form structures such as nanopillars (1999) [R4]. This\u000a      work was led by\u000a      Emeritus Professor Mino Green. It has the advantage compared to other\u000a      sub-micron\u000a      patterning techniques that it can be used to process large areas rapidly\u000a      and at low cost,\u000a      making it suitable for applications where electron-beam writing, for\u000a      example, would be\u000a      prohibitively expensive. A number of applications enabled by this\u000a      technique were developed,\u000a      including high surface area substrates for Raman spectroscopy. One\u000a      application with\u000a      particular commercial impact was opened up when the group demonstrated\u000a      that such nano-structured\u000a      surfaces could be used in silicon anodes for lithium ion batteries (2003)\u000a      [R5]. The\u000a      energy density in lithium batteries is limited by the anode's ability to\u000a      dissolve lithium, which in\u000a      silicon causes damage due to lattice strain. The ability to relax such\u000a      strain using a high density\u000a      nanopillar array allows significant energy density enhancement at low\u000a      production cost.\u000a    Professor Tom Pike, who joined the group in 2001, further developed the\u000a      field by using 3D\u000a      structuring of silicon to create textured substrates for the microscopic\u000a      examination of the soil of\u000a      Mars. These substrates trapped and separated samples collected by a Mars\u000a      surface lander for\u000a      detailed imaging by an optical and atomic force microscope (2010) [R6].\u000a      The combination of\u000a      Pike's space research background and the group's microfabrication\u000a      capabilities, including\u000a      precision through-wafer etching, provided the basis from which this\u000a      innovation arose.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42167","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    We now provide details of the 5 aforementioned impacts and their links to\u000d\u000a      underpinning research:\u000d\u000a    I1) DNA Electronics (DNAe) is a start-up company founded by\u000d\u000a      Toumazou to exploit the group's breakthrough in semiconductor-based gene\u000d\u000a      sequencing in [R1, R2, R3]. Since 2008, DNAe has developed two genetic\u000d\u000a      analysis platforms: a DNA sequencing platform suited for laboratory use,\u000d\u000a      and a \"point-of-care\" platform called Genalysis&#174; which is suited for\u000d\u000a      rapid, lab-free testing by non-expert users [E1].\u000d\u000a\u0009\u000d\u000a\u0009\u000d\u000a\u0009\u000d\u000a    DNAe now employs over 45 full time staff in the UK, brought in revenue of\u000d\u000a      in excess of &#163;25 million through their licensing and collaboration\u000d\u000a      activity, and won six industrial awards. These include: the BBC Focus\u000d\u000a      award for Innovation, the Elektra European Electronics Industry Award for\u000d\u000a      R&amp;D, and e-Legacy Award for Medical Advances (all in 2009); and three\u000d\u000a      IET Awards for Healthcare, for Emerging Technologies and for Electronics\u000d\u000a      (all in 2010).\u000d\u000a    I2) DNAe's sequencing platform technology with its associated patents\u000d\u000a      (US7888015, US 7649358, US7686929, US8114591), all based on the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research [R1-R3], was licensed to Ion Torrent Systems [E2]\u000d\u000a      and Roche in 2010 [E3]. Ion Torrent Systems was subsequently bought by\u000d\u000a      Life Technologies Inc. for $725 million. Their first DNA sequencing\u000d\u000a      product based on DNAe's technology [E4], the Personal Genome Machine\u000d\u000a      (PGM), was launched in Q1 2011. In the first 18 months since launch in the\u000d\u000a      first quarter of 2011, 1300 units of the PGM were shipped and generated\u000d\u000a      around $100 million in sales revenue for Ion Torrent [E5]. The fact that\u000d\u000a      the PGM is based on DNAe's technology is corroborated in [E4], stating:\u000d\u000a    \"Ion semiconductor sequencing is based on the detection of hydrogen\u000d\u000a        ions released during DNA synthesis. Ion Torrent licensed the technology\u000d\u000a        from DNA Electronics in 2010 and incorporated it into products such as\u000d\u000a        the Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM).\"\u000d\u000a    I3) Since its release in 2011, the PGM product is being used for clinical\u000d\u000a      and public health applications, and lives have been saved as a result. For\u000d\u000a      instance, the Beery twins' rare genetic disease, dopa-responsive dystonia,\u000d\u000a      was discovered by DNA sequencing using our technology and has since been\u000d\u000a      treated with appropriate medication [E6]. Another example of the impact of\u000d\u000a      our DNA sequencing technology is demonstrated in combating the German E.\u000d\u000a      Coli outbreak of 2011, which was so serious that at least 26 people died\u000d\u000a      and more than 2,700 have been sickened by the outbreak in at least 13\u000d\u000a      different countries [E7]. Using the PGM, scientists were able to complete\u000d\u000a      rapidly the process of sequencing the 5.4 million letters of the latest\u000d\u000a      bug's genetic code in only three days [E7]. Previous light beam based DNA\u000d\u000a      sequencers would have taken at least a week to read the code of an\u000d\u000a      organism's genome.\u000d\u000a    I4) Toumaz is a second start-up; founded to exploit the group's\u000d\u000a      research in ultra-low power techniques for wireless physiological\u000d\u000a      monitoring. Since 2008, Toumaz developed the SensiumVitals&#174; platform, a\u000d\u000a      wireless system designed to monitor the vital signs of hospital patients.\u000d\u000a      The system, which exploits the underpinning research in [R4, R5 and R6],\u000d\u000a      comprises of a lightweight disposable wireless patch that monitors a\u000d\u000a      patient's vital signs (heart-rate, respiration and axillary temperature)\u000d\u000a      and then wirelessly communicates this data to doctors and nurses via the\u000d\u000a      hospital's patient monitoring IT system. The SensiumVitals&#174; digital\u000d\u000a      plaster is the first product aimed at the general floor population of a\u000d\u000a      hospital to have received FDA (510k) approval in 2011 [E8] and\u000d\u000a      subsequently received the CE mark in 2013.\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000a\u0009  Toumaz's FDA approved and CE marked SensiumVitals&#174; digital plaster.\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000a    Toumaz is now an AIM-listed company (symbol: TMZ) employing 180 people in\u000d\u000a      five countries (of which approximately half are in the UK), with 2012\u000d\u000a      year-end assets of GBP 51.9 million, and revenue (pro-forma) of GBP 22.3\u000d\u000a      million. Toumaz has won numerous awards prior to 2008 and the National\u000d\u000a      Microelectronics Institute (NMI) award in 2009.\u000d\u000a    I5) The Toumaz SensiumVitals&#174; digital plaster has proven to be beneficial in\u000d\u000a    a clinical setting. In a trial at Saint John's Health Centre in Santa\u000d\u000a    Monica, CA, it was demonstrated that the SensiumVitals&#174; system provided\u000d\u000a    early warnings of adverse physiological events to clinical staff. The study\u000d\u000a    showed that the system enables early detection of deterioration, meaning\u000d\u000a    patients can be treated more quickly and safely. In addition, the device was\u000d\u000a    shown to be better than alternatives for patient recovery because it is\u000d\u000a    lightweight, unobtrusive, and comfortable to wear, and so enables patients\u000d\u000a    to walk around. The system was also shown to integrate well with existing\u000d\u000a    clinical workflows. The development of this new technology is widely\u000d\u000a    believed to be part of a new revolution in healthcare technology [E9].\u000d\u000a    Toumaz has secured an international distribution agreement for its\u000d\u000a    SensiumVitals&#174; digital plaster from NantHealth Group in the US in Oct 2013.\u000d\u000a    Through an initial order of 250,000 units, the SensiumVitals&#174; digital\u000d\u000a    plaster is being fully adopted first in Accident &amp; Emergency at Hurley\u000d\u000a    Medical Center in Flint, Michigan (US) [E10].\u000d\u000a    In recognition of Professor Toumazou's success \".... in applying\u000a        semiconductor technology to biomedical and life-science applications,\u000d\u000a        most recently to DNA analysis\", Royal Society awarded him the 2013\u000d\u000a      Gabor Medal (http:\/\/royalsociety.org\/awards\/gabor-medal\/).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u0009Toumaz SensiumVitals&#174; digital plaster in trials at Saint John's Health\u000d\u000a      Centre (Santa Monica, CA) &#8212; the http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uVxO4xh_dDs\u000d\u000a\u0009\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Chris Toumazou FRS and his team at Imperial College have\u000d\u000a      developed biomedical technologies based on ultra-low-power CMOS and ISFET\u000d\u000a      electronics to provide the medical community with the means to rapidly\u000d\u000a      diagnose, monitor, and treat diseases with confidence and at low cost.\u000d\u000a      Since 2008, the impact of this research has been to:\u000d\u000a    I1) spinout a start-up company DNA Electronics (DNAe) to deliver\u000d\u000a      point-of-care products to quickly recognize genetic diseases and identify\u000d\u000a      potential poor drug interactions;\u000d\u000a    I2) enable Life Technologies (formerly Ion Torrent) to develop the\u000d\u000a      Personal Genome Machine (PGM) that have generated $100m in sales (in the\u000d\u000a      18 months since its launch) using DNAe's core semiconductor sequencing IP;\u000d\u000a    I3) save lives by using the PGM in clinical and public health\u000d\u000a      applications;\u000d\u000a    I4) spinout a second start-up company (Toumaz) that has released\u000d\u000a      SensiumVitals&#174;, a FDA-approved and CE-marked ultra-low power system for\u000d\u000a      wireless monitoring of patient vital signs;\u000d\u000a    I5) provide early warning of adverse physiological events in clinical\u000d\u000a      settings using the SensiumVitals&#174; platform resulting in improved quality\u000d\u000a      of patient care and reduced demand on intensive care provision in\u000d\u000a      hospitals internationally.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Imperial College London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Imperial College London","InstitutionName":"Imperial College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003270}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    (*References that best indicate quality of underpinning research.)\u000d\u000a    \u000a[R1]* S.

Disruptive semiconductor\u000d\u000a      technology in healthcare relies upon leveraging CMOS technology in novel\u000d\u000a      and unusual ways, for example, designing custom VLSI structures for\u000d\u000a      biosensing, or by exploiting the underlying device physics for energy\u000d\u000a      efficient low precision analogue processing. The biomedical electronics\u000d\u000a      team at Imperial led by Professor Christofer Toumazou has produced key\u000d\u000a      advances in this area as described below.\u000d\u000a    There are two aspects to the underpinning research for this case study.\u000d\u000a      The first relates to point-of-care diagnostics for the detection of\u000d\u000a      genetic sequences. This field requires biosensing platforms that are\u000d\u000a      sensitive to the target sequence, are fast, can be mass-manufactured, and\u000d\u000a      are disposable. Conventional lab-based methods of detecting DNA sequences\u000d\u000a      rely on optical methods; typically by the addition of fluorescent tags to\u000d\u000a      the target DNA that in turn latches onto a DNA probe sequence only if\u000d\u000a      there is a match between the two. Our research this past decade has\u000d\u000a      developed a pioneering all-electrical approach that does not require\u000d\u000a      tagging of DNA. The principle of label-free electrochemical DNA\u000d\u000a        detection using an ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) was\u000d\u000a      originally described in [R1]. This is now referred to in the industry as\u000d\u000a      \"next generation semiconductor sequencing\".\u000d\u000a    A problem with electro-chemical sensors is that they are known to suffer\u000d\u000a      from non-idealities and significant variability in parameters such as\u000d\u000a      drift, offset, sensitivity and lifetime. Fabricating them in CMOS makes\u000d\u000a      them cheap, easy to mass-produce, and allows integration with electronic\u000d\u000a      circuits, but at the same time further degrades their performance. The\u000d\u000a      breakthrough of our research came from the recognition that such on-chip\u000d\u000a      sensors, although inaccurate for absolute measurement, could be harnessed\u000d\u000a      for relative monitoring, i.e. detecting changes rather than absolute\u000d\u000a      values. Specifically, we engineered methods for achieving robust\u000d\u000a        on-chip relative pH sensing based on the Ion-Sensitive Field Effect\u000d\u000a        Transistor (ISFET) in a standard CMOS technology. Through a variety\u000d\u000a      of device, circuit and system innovations, a platform that is low cost,\u000d\u000a      easy to manufacture and reliable has been realized [R2, R3].\u000d\u000a    The second aspect of the underpinning research has been the reduction of\u000d\u000a      transmitted bandwidth from biosensors. Sensory systems acting on real\u000d\u000a      world data typically consist of an analogue sensor interface with signal\u000d\u000a      conditioning, data conversion, and wireless communication, requiring high\u000d\u000a      bandwidth when transmitting raw data. Our research established how to\u000d\u000a      achieve power reduction by placing local intelligence at the front-end,\u000d\u000a      thus reducing communication bandwidth. Using analogue signal processing\u000d\u000a      prior to data conversion, ultra energy-efficient processing could be\u000d\u000a      achieved but at the expense of variability (i.e. drift) and\u000d\u000a      reconfigurability. These limitations were overcome by combining\u000d\u000a      closed-loop digital calibration to ultra low power analogue circuits thus\u000d\u000a      achieving both energy efficiency and precision [R4, R5]. This ultra low\u000d\u000a      power approach has been demonstrated in a number of applications including\u000d\u000a      the world's first totally implantable cochlear prosthesis. This new\u000d\u000a      prosthesis was independently assessed to reduce power consumption by up to\u000d\u000a      two orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art [R6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42168","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    We now provide details of the five aforementioned impacts and their link\u000a      to underpinning research:\u000a    I1) Xilinx Corp. is a US$2.2 billion company (2012) with nearly a 50%\u000a      share of the FPGA devices market. The impact of our research in FPGA\u000a      technology is evidenced in their testimony (Dr. G. Brebner, Distinguished\u000a      Engineer from Xilinx [E1]):\u000a    \"The research group led by you (Prof. Luk) in Department of Computing\u000a        and Professor Peter Cheung in Department of EEE ... is second-to-none\u000a        internationally, both in terms of quality and quantity. Your team has\u000a        pioneered many key technologies which have resulted ... in significant\u000a        industrial impact.\"\u000a    For example, Dr. Brebner refers specifically to our work on partial\u000a      run-time reconfiguration [1], which \"... has had a major impact on\u000a        multiple generations of Xilinx devices that support run-time\u000a        reconfiguration\", and \"..... underpins the design flow for the\u000a        latest Xilinx device supporting partial run-time reconfiguration\".\u000a      The specific devices introduced since 2008 were Virtex-5 (65nm), Virtex-6\u000a      (40nm) and Virtex-7 (28nm) devices as well as their latest Zynq device\u000a      family, which embeds ARM processor cores within the FPGA fabric. Xilinx's\u000a      document UG702, entitled \"Partial Reconfiguration User Guide\" and\u000a      published in October 2012, demonstrates that our work [R1], first\u000a      published in 1997, has stood the test of time: its impact is still found\u000a      in design flow for Xilinx Zynq devices introduced in 2011 [E1].\u000a    I2) Our underpinning research into acceleration of compute-intensive\u000a      algorithms using FPGA technology has led to its successful commercial\u000a      exploitation in the start-up company, Maxeler. The company, with Head\u000a      Office in Hammersmith, employs 70 members of staff in the UK and US. Many\u000a      of the key technologies it employs can be traced directly to the research\u000a      conducted by the team at Imperial College [3,4]. In particular, the\u000a      MaxCompiler and MaxGen tools are rooted in Imperial tools. These tools\u000a      enable MaxCloud, the industry's first FPGA-based cloud computing service,\u000a      to provide high performance dataflow computation capability through the\u000a      cloud [E2]. Underpinning research by Cheung and Luk also led to several US\u000a      patents (US6369610, US7543283, US12\/747650) assigned to Maxeler on 2 Nov\u000a      2012. Moreover, Maxeler US patent US20130139122 A1 cited their work on\u000a      word-length optimisation (R5).\u000a    I3) The FPGA-based technology from Maxeler is used by JP Morgan [E3] and\u000a      by other finance companies such as Scottish Widows [E4] for accelerating a\u000a      variety of financial modelling calculations including risk analysis. This\u000a      is therefore direct impact of our research in [2-5]. In one example, the\u000a      compute time was reduced from 8 hours to less than 4 minutes [E5]. The\u000a      effectiveness of this technology resulted in JP Morgan purchasing a 20%\u000a      stake in Maxeler [E6]. According to JP Morgan's Managing Director and\u000a      Global Head of their Applied Analytics Group, the total investment made by\u000a      JP Morgan in deploying our reconfigurable technology amounts to US$30m\u000a      with an annual estimated saving in running cost of US$6m, in addition to\u000a      compute time reduction. Furthermore, the reconfigurable computing systems\u000a      \"support our business units that manage the risk on positions in the\u000a        trillions of dollars\" [E7].\u000a    I4) In addition to financial applications, our reconfigurable computing\u000a      technology [2-5] has had a strong impact on oil and gas exploration. The\u000a      oil and gas industry is a major user of high- performance computing. In\u000a      geoscience, computational cycles are dominated by relatively few and well\u000a      defined kernels. Using Maxeler's FPGA-based hardware platform and\u000a      optimising the algorithm implemented with the Maxeler tool flow, speedups\u000a      of almost 250 times compared to the use of a single CPU core have been\u000a      reported by Chevron [E8]. Faster seismic analysis and imaging allows more\u000a      application runs or modelling with higher fidelity, or both. Quicker and\u000a      more accurate results enable oil and gas companies to make more informed\u000a      bids on parcels and subsequent drilling. Shorter turnaround time on these\u000a      seismic applications is critical to the company's profit, especially when\u000a      they are in a bidding process for drilling rights.\u000a    I5) BlueBee Technologies is a start-up company that provides tools for\u000a      heterogeneous multi- core platforms. The success of its tools was\u000a      recognised by a prestigious Valorisation award from the Dutch Technology\u000a      Foundation, STW, in December 2012. According to BlueBee's CEO [E9],\u000a      several key components in the BlueBee tool chain &#8212; such as task\u000a      transformation and mapping selection &#8212; are directly based on our research\u000a      on high-level compilation tool chains for heterogeneous systems [6];\u000a      success of BlueBee can be attributed to our pioneering research which laid\u000a      the foundations for many important developments in word- length\u000a      optimisation [3] and high-level design transformation [6]. Recently\u000a      BlueBee has teamed up with HL Steam, a company responsible for the Ancoa\u000a      financial market integrity platform, to support FPGA-based acceleration\u000a      for such platforms. The impact of our research is therefore also ongoing:\u000a      the enabling of real-world workloads of millions of financial transactions\u000a      per second to be efficiently processed at lower dollar and energy cost\u000a      [E10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In the last 20 years, reconfigurable technology has transformed\u000a      High-Performance Computing and Embedded Systems Design.

They provide an affordable vehicle for hardware acceleration of\u000a      sophisticated software. The emergence of FPGAs has enabled novel computing\u000a      engines for solving complex scientific and commercial problems. Research\u000a      groups in Department of Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering (EEE) and\u000a      the Department of Computing (DoC) conducted the underpinning research for\u000a      the above impacts (I1- I5).

These research groups and their\u000a      collaborations have produced significant research advances that underpin\u000a      the above impacts, clustered in five topics (R1-R5) and mapped to\u000a      references and the specific impacts:\u000a    R1 Design of FPGA-based reconfigurable computing systems [1,2; I1]:\u000a      FPGA-based computing systems provide the flexibility of run-time\u000a      reconfigurability. However, this advantage also adds a new dimension to\u000a      the complexity of system design, especially when the FPGA device supports\u000a      partial run-time reconfiguration. Since 1995, our teams have developed new\u000a      automatic design tools that efficiently exploit the dynamic reconfigurable\u000a      nature of FPGAs in producing novel implementations of computing systems.\u000a      For specific classes of devices, the techniques we developed reduce\u000a      reconfiguration time from time linear in their size to constant time at\u000a      best and logarithmic time at worst. This work has resulted in two granted\u000a      patents (US6369610, US7543283).\u000a    R2 FPGA-specific compilation and synthesis [3,4; I2-I4]: This\u000a      stream compiler provides a software-like programming interface to hardware\u000a      design; it targets FPGAs but maintains the performance of hand-designed\u000a      circuits. This compiler and interface improve productivity by letting\u000a      programmers optimize implementations at multiple levels &#8212;\u000a      algorithms, architecture, arithmetic, and gates &#8212; and all within the same\u000a      C++ program. This increased productivity is demonstrated in hardware\u000a      acceleration of a range of applications, e.g. encryption with Kasumi and\u000a      IDEA, function evaluation, and Wavelet and LZ-like compression.\u000a    R3 Optimizing word-length and data for area, power, performance, and\u000a        accuracy trade- offs [5; I2-I5]: In conventional computers, the\u000a      word-length (e.g. in a 32-bit or 64-bit ALU) and data format (e.g. fixed\u000a      or floating point) are fixed by the architecture. FPGAs provide the\u000a      freedom of optimally determining word-length and data format according to\u000a      the needs of specific applications. Based on an approach that combined\u000a      analytical and heuristic methods, our teams pioneered &#8212; since 1999 &#8212; a\u000a      number of techniques for determining word-lengths and data formats that\u000a      will both optimize area, performance and power consumption for a given\u000a      system-level specification (e.g. worst-case accuracy and signal-to-noise\u000a      ratio). These techniques also allow us to trade off the accuracy of\u000a      computations with other desired performance characteristics (e.g.\u000a      performance).\u000a    R4 Transferring reconfigurable FPGA-based technology into\u000a        applications [2-5; I3,I4]: Since 1995, our teams have researched how\u000a      the aforementioned new techniques can be applied to solve industrial and\u000a      commercial problems. Our research has demonstrated the applicability of\u000a      these techniques in various industrial applications domains such as\u000a      financial analysis, seismic modelling and digital signal processing. In\u000a      particular, we are responsible for some of the earliest research on\u000a      accelerating financial applications, which produced a powerful\u000a      mathematical framework for rapid execution of a wide class of Monte-Carlo\u000a      simulations. In the framework, Monte-Carlo applications can be written in\u000a      a high-level language, which a streaming compiler such as ours can\u000a      nonetheless convert into high- performance data pipelines.

Imperial's research\u000d\u000a      demonstrates that offshore networks will be over-invested if built to\u000d\u000a      onshore design standards. Hiorns stated that [E2]:\u000d\u000a    \"The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) undertaken by Strbac (and his\u000d\u000a        team)... demonstrated ... no case for redundancy given the high cost of\u000d\u000a        offshore cables ... balanced against the low load factor (&lt;40%) of\u000d\u000a        offshore wind farm generation, the low security value of offshore wind\u000d\u000a        and the absence of demand offshore.\"\u000d\u000a    I3) Assist National Grid in planning network investment [E2]: As\u000d\u000a      a result of the SQSS review and the new Offshore Network Design Standards,\u000d\u000a      National Grid developed a \"Smart Transmission Zone\" to experiment with new\u000d\u000a      solutions. Furthermore, National Grid now uses Strbac's transmission\u000d\u000a      investment model (known as DTIM) to perform cost-benefit analysis of\u000d\u000a      transmission investment. According to Hiorns, based on this analysis they\u000d\u000a      were able to demonstrate the case for reinforcing Great Britain's network\u000d\u000a      through a new investment plan worth more than &#163;3bn. This plan was\u000d\u000a      subsequently approved by the Regulator, Ofgem [E2].\u000d\u000a    I4) New standard leading to savings by National Grid [E2]:\u000d\u000a      According to Ofgem, there are 20 offshore wind farms with network\u000d\u000a      connections worth an estimated &#163;2.5bn. Hiorns stated in [E2] that:\u000d\u000a    \".... I [Hiorns] estimate that the design with the new standard, based\u000d\u000a        on the methodology developed by Prof Strbac and his team, made savings\u000d\u000a        of more than &#163;500m ...

The impact of our\u000d\u000a      work on Alstom's high voltage DC (HVDC) business is corroborated by the\u000d\u000a      testimonial from Colin Davidson, Chief Technology Officer (HVDC) of Alstom\u000d\u000a      Grid [E3]. Key control innovations on cell balancing, fault blocking and\u000d\u000a      active filtering have been jointly patented with Alstom [E4a-c]. The\u000d\u000a      analytical approach to design trade-offs has enabled Alstom to refine its\u000d\u000a      \"second generation\" Voltage Source Converters (VSC) to minimise footprint\u000d\u000a      for offshore HVDC use. Our team's role in advancing Alstom's second\u000d\u000a      generation VSC from a concept (at TRL-1) to key plank of Alstom's strategy\u000d\u000a      at TRL-4 is evidenced by the 3 joint patents through which, as Davidson\u000d\u000a      states in [E3], the Imperial team:\u000d\u000a    \".... have provided Alstom with the detailed technical analysis,\u000d\u000a        creative novel solutions and with commercial considerations that we hold\u000d\u000a        in the highest regard.

This eventually\u000d\u000a      developed into multi-level converters for High Voltage DC (HVDC)\u000d\u000a      technology for offshore wind generation and for medium voltage\u000d\u000a      distribution. The team was significantly strengthened with the arrival of\u000d\u000a      Prof. Goran Strbac in 2005, and together they extended their research\u000d\u000a      direction towards power network planning and optimisation, with particular\u000d\u000a      focus on renewable generation such as offshore wind farms. The\u000d\u000a      underpinning research that produced the aforementioned impact has the\u000d\u000a      following three related themes:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aCost-benefit Analysis and Modelling of Power Networks [R1-3; I1-4,\u000d\u000a          I6]: The incorporation and widespread adoption of diverse\u000d\u000a        renewable generation sources in existing and future networks created new\u000d\u000a        challenges in analysing, modelling and optimising electricity\u000d\u000a        transmission systems. The energy production patterns of such sources of\u000d\u000a        generation are often intermittent and unpredictable, varying from steady\u000d\u000a        to very fast changing. Our team identified that stochastic and Monte\u000d\u000a        Carlo extensions to the traditional Optimal Power Flow formulation were\u000d\u000a        necessary. Fine time-resolution analysis of a large number of cases is\u000d\u000a        needed to expose numerous conditions such as corner cases, which becomes\u000d\u000a        an analytically challenging large-scale stochastic optimisation problem.\u000d\u000a        This problem was pursued by the team at Imperial as part of the\u000d\u000a        FutureNet (2003-07) [GR\/S28082\/01] and the FlexNet (2007-2012)\u000d\u000a        [EP\/E04011X\/1] projects. Based on cost-benefit analysis (CBA), the team\u000d\u000a        created a network planning and optimisation tool that yields a solution\u000d\u000a        requiring lower asset investment than the existing method of redundancy\u000d\u000a        provision. This tool achieved the goal of providing security of supply\u000d\u000a        while producing optimum asset investment decisions based on local\u000d\u000a        topology, specific seasonal risks and generation type.

Multi-level power\u000d\u000a        converters (for HVDC etc.) were analysed by Green in 1996-2002, as were\u000d\u000a        factors determining trade-offs between topology, level-number, total\u000d\u000a        harmonic distortion and passive component volume [R4]. Innovation in\u000d\u000a        AC\/DC converters to create the right properties for forming HVDC\u000d\u000a        networks between offshore wind farms was the focus in 2007-2012. [R5] is\u000d\u000a        the first description of the Alternate Arm Converter that included means\u000d\u000a        to balance energy between its cells and the means to control flow of\u000d\u000a        current into AC-side and DC-side faults. Managing DC faults is a major\u000d\u000a        step toward forming HVDC networks. [R5] demonstrates these features\u000d\u000a        together with an efficiency of 99% and only requiring reasonable volume\u000d\u000a        of cell capacitors: important for offshore platforms use.

His work at\u000a      Imperial focused on understanding the mechanisms behind why Bioglass&#174;\u000a      performed better in\u000a      animal experiments than other bioceramics. Bioglass&#174; was known\u000a      to bond to bone faster than\u000a      other materials and to stimulate more rapid bone growth. Dr Julian Jones,\u000a      now a Reader in the\u000a      Department of Materials, carried out his PhD with Hench and was\u000a      instrumental in carrying out key\u000a      experiments.\u000a    Cell Culture studies: Hench's cell culture studies, carried out by\u000a      his student Ioannis Xynos (co-supervised\u000a      by Professor Dame Julia Polak of the Faculty of Medicine and co-director,\u000a      with Hench,\u000a      of the Tissue Engineering and Regerative Medecine centre at Imperial)\u000a      found that the dissolution\u000a      products of the glass, stimulated bone cells at the genetic level, causing\u000a      the cells to produce bone\u000a      matrix [1]. For example the study showed that expression of insulin-like\u000a      growth factor II (IGF-II)\u000a      increased by more than three-fold in the presence of the dissolution\u000a      products of the glass. IGF is\u000a      the most abundant growth factor in bone and induces osteoblast\u000a      proliferation [1]. Extracellular\u000a      matrix secretion was also increased, which mineralised without addition of\u000a      supplements.\u000a      Importantly, a beneficial response was dependent on the dose of ions to\u000a      which the cells were\u000a      exposed. Work reported in 2009 by Olga Tsigkou (PDRA), Dr Julian Jones and\u000a      Professor Molly\u000a      Stevens (all Department of Materials) later found that the optimal\u000a      concentration of soluble silica to\u000a      be 15-20 03bcgml-1 promoted the highest metabolic activity [5].\u000a      The work showed that the beneficial\u000a      properties of Bioglass were due not only to its ability to bond to bone\u000a      but also due to the dissolution\u000a      products stimulating bone cells [1, 5]. The dissolution products caused\u000a      biomineralisation (biological\u000a      mineral formation) without any addition growth factors and without a\u000a      bioactive glass substrate [5].\u000a      Hench termed the behaviour \"Osteostimulation\", which was coined and used\u000a      by NovaBone\u000a      Products to describe the advantage Bioglass had over its competitors.\u000a    The result that the dissolution ions were stimulating cellular activity\u000a      seeded the idea that if particles\u000a      were introduced into toothpaste and dissolved in the mouth, natural repair\u000a      of enamel may occur\u000a      through biomineralisation of the dentine (formation of biological\u000a      hydroxyapatite that is very similar\u000a      to the mineral in dentine). It was then important to determine the optimal\u000a      particle size and dose of\u000a      particles that should be used.\u000a    Particle size: Further understanding of how particle size and\u000a      doseage (mass\/solution volume)\u000a      influenced natural enamel repair, was needed. Jones and Hench produced\u000a      data on how glass\u000a      composition, particle size, specific surface area [2,4] and dosage [3]\u000a      affected pH rise, dissolution\u000a      profiles and mineral formation, which were critical to optimisation and\u000a      commercialisation of the\u000a      toothpaste. For example, Bioglass particles with particle sizes less than\u000a      5 &#181;m were found to\u000a      nucleate hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA, the mineral component of enamel\u000a      and dentine) within 22\u000a      hours in simulated body fluid when 2 mg\/ml or less was used,\u000a      but when higher concentrations were\u000a      used, calcium carbonate formed instead [3]. The work showed that the\u000a      smallest particles could be\u000a      made with high-surface area and a narrow size distribution [2] and the\u000a      fine particles dissolved and\u000a      formed mineral (hydroxyapatite) fastest [4]. Studies in physiological\u000a      solutions showed that using\u000a      too high a concentration of the &lt; 5 03bcm particles in a fixed volume,\u000a      could change the reaction of the\u000a      glass, forming calcium carbonate instead of the enamel-like hydroxyapatite\u000a      [3]. As a result the\u000a      toothpaste contains the &lt; 5 03bcm particles of Bioglass at a\u000a      concentration of 7.5%.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42171","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research led to the invention and patenting of a new\u000a      class of fuel cell, namely a\u000a      metal-supported SOFC operating at 500-600&#186;C [A,B].

On 25th April 2012 Ceres signed an\u000a      agreement with the Itho-Daalderop\u000a      Group B.V. to distribute Ceres fuel cell CHP products into the residential\u000a      mass market within the\u000a      Benelux countries. [E]. On restructuring of the company in 2013, staff\u000a      numbers have been\u000a      reduced and the operating costs have also been reduced by 44% to &#163;10.2M.\u000a    \u000a\u0009Figure 1: A Ceres metal supported cell with the CHP unit in the\u000a      background\u000a\u0009\u0009\u000a    Development of SOFC systems is a very competitive field of research in\u000a      terms of fundamental\u000a      science, technology development, and commercialisation. Ceres was\u000a      nominated by the Institute of\u000a      Materials Mining and Minerals for the Queen Elizabeth Prize for\u000a      Engineering in 2013 and John\u000a      Kilner was awarded the platinum medal [F]. The Imperial \/Ceres development\u000a      of metal-supported\u000a      cells has had a major impact on world development of SOFCs. This was\u000a      recognised in 2012 by an\u000a      independent review of the Ceres technology undertaken by an international\u000a      expert in SOFCs Dr\u000a      Nguyen Minh [G]. Some of his findings are:\u000a    \"Unique cell\/stack designs based on thin stainless steel foil\u000a        interconnect and laser drilled\u000a        substrate, imparting high levels of mechanical robustness and thermal\u000a        cyclability and creating\u000a        compact, lightweight sub-systems.\"; \"Increased cell\/stack\u000a        reliability due to durable and stable seals\u000a        formed by welding and compression (vs. delicate glass seals commonly\u000a        used in conventional\u000a        SOFCs).\"; \"Low-cost, volume manufacturability based on\u000a        conventional processes such as metal\u000a        forming and screen printing with ability for high levels of\u000a        automation.\"; \"Patents and know-how\u000a        covering laser drilled foil substrate, cell configuration, stack design,\u000a        manufacturing procedures and\u000a        conditions provide significant protection against competition\". [G]\u000a    Because of these major advantages many researchers and developers (e.g.\u000a      Topsoe Fuel Cells,\u000a      Denmark) are currently pursuing metal-supported cell technology operating\u000a      at approximately\u000a      600&#176;C. Thus the research in this impact statement has led the field by\u000a      approximately 10 years and\u000a      there have been many imitators (e.g. a recent EU Project METSOFC,\u000a      2008-2011). However, no\u000a      other developer has yet succeeded in matching the performance of the Ceres\u000a      Power cells. As a\u000a      result of this world-leading performance Ceres is now moving to embrace a\u000a      global market for its\u000a      products and in July of this year announced a commercial and technical\u000a      partnership agreement\u000a      with South Korea's largest boiler manufacturer, KD Navien. The press\u000a      release states \"KD Navien is\u000a      the dominant boiler manufacturer in South Korea with the largest market\u000a      share of all installed\u000a      boilers. It is also a major exporter to key markets around the world,\u000a      particularly the US\". [H]\u000a    In summary Ceres Power is a UK based SME, with globally leading fuel cell\u000a      technology based on\u000a      research at Imperial College London, and a strong foothold in the\u000a      burgeoning market for low\u000a      carbon technologies such as mCHP.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Patents arising from EPSRC funded research by Kilner (PI) and Steele,\u000a      Atkinson and Brandon\u000a      (CoI's) resulted in the development of a unique metal-supported solid\u000a      oxide fuel cell and formation\u000a      of the spin out company Ceres Power in 2001.

A strategic theme in this research, which resulted\u000a      in the specific innovation\u000a      described here, was to reduce the SOFC operating temperature as much as\u000a      possible. In the early\u000a      1990's, there was a resurgence of interest in the solid oxide fuel cell\u000a      and the Department of\u000a      Materials (Steele, Kilner, Atkinson) began a program of research to\u000a      develop materials capable of\u000a      operating at much lower temperatures. Conventional cells operated at\u000a      between 700 and 1000&#186;C\u000a      and were, in the main, all ceramic devices employing brittle glass seals.\u000a      These devices were\u000a      costly and mechanically weak with durability problems caused by the high\u000a      temperatures of\u000a      operation. The goal of the research was to find a materials set that could\u000a      operate at temperatures\u000a      as low as 500&#186;C, where much cheaper stainless steels could be used for\u000a      support of the cell,\u000a      interconnects and for the balance of plant. Through a basic research\u000a      programme, this materials\u000a      set was identified based around an optimised ceria gadolinia electrolyte\u000a      (reference 1), a nickel-\u000a      ceria anode and doped lanthanum ferrite (LSCF) cathode (reference 2). The\u000a      core patent behind\u000a      Ceres arose out of research conducted through EPSRC grant GR\/N04638\/01\u000a      OPTIMISATION\u000a      AND EVALUATION OF INTERMEDIATE-TEMP (500 C)SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL (IT-SOFC)\u000a      STACKS (J A Kilner (PI), N P Brandon, B C H Steele, A Atkinson, all of\u000a      Imperial College London)\u000a      1st October 2000 to 31st January 2004. This focussed\u000a      on developing; the anode and cathode\u000a      material for use with ceria electrolytes; the electrode, electrolyte and\u000a      cell fabrication processes that\u000a      enabled SOFC operation at 500-600&#186;C; and use of a metal support to produce\u000a      a robust device free\u000a      of the need for delicate glass ceramic seals (reference 3). At that time,\u000a      a metal-supported SOFC\u000a      was a radical new concept, as was the relatively low operating temperature\u000a      of 500-600&#186;C for a\u000a      SOFC, and this research was the first to demonstrate a working device. Now\u000a      several companies\u000a      and research groups worldwide are pursuing metal-supported SOFC\u000a      technology, and the reduction\u000a      of operating temperatures to 500&#186;C, or even lower.\u000a    Core patents behind Ceres Power fuel cell module technology were filed by\u000a      Atkinson, Kilner et al.,\u000a      over the period 2000 to 2004, and subsequently granted from 2003 to 2006\u000a      (reference 4).\u000a      Subsequent to the patent filing, papers were published by Atkinson, Kilner\u000a      et al over the period\u000a      2004 onwards which addressed issues such as the properties of the LSCF\u000a      cathode (reference 5)\u000a      and the development of new materials for ITSOFCs (reference 6).\u000a      Publication of some of this\u000a      material was not possible before the patents were filed, but contributed\u000a      to the patents. Other\u000a      research has contributed to the ongoing technology development at Ceres\u000a      Power. The core\u000a      underpinning research that supported Ceres Power was carried out through a\u000a      series of EPSRC\u000a      funded programmes which included a grant to transfer the technology for\u000a      the deposition of the cells\u000a      onto the stainless steel substrates, from the Department of Materials to\u000a      Ceres Power (Optimised\u000a      thick film electrolytes for IT-SOFC manufacture, GR\/S81476\/01, J.A Kilner\u000a      October 2003-October\u000a      2004).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42172","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    UK based Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is the world's second-largest\u000a      manufacturer of jet engines in\u000a      wide body civil aircraft [A], in competition with the largest industrial\u000a      company in the world and US\u000a      defence contractor, GE.

Rolls-Royce is one of the UK's largest manufacturing\u000a      exporters, with 75% of its\u000a      revenue coming from overseas [C]. Rolls-Royce, unsurprisingly, wish to\u000a      retain competitive\u000a      advantage, hence their interest in research that will a) reduce the\u000a      probability of blade failure and b)\u000a      allow a 10K higher operating temperature that saves fuel and reduces\u000a      emissions. The impact of\u000a      our research lies in two key areas:\u000a    1. The microstructure of nickel superalloys: casting,\u000a          porosity, grain orientation and creep\u000a          prediction\u000a    Nickel superalloys are used in the manufacture of jet engines blades due\u000a      to their excellent\u000a      mechanical strength and resistance to creep (tendency for solids to slowly\u000a      move or deform under\u000a      stress) at high temperatures; good surface stability; and corrosion and\u000a      oxidation resistance.\u000a      Optimising these properties via composition or manufacturing process is\u000a      key to the successful\u000a      manufacture and sale of jet engines and to the continual improvement of\u000a      fuel efficiency in aircraft.\u000a      Because of the significant fuel cost and CO2 savings realised,\u000a      they are replaced every 10,000 h\u000a      (around every 2 years). Relatively high volume manufacturing of these\u000a      blades is therefore essential\u000a      and the cost of manufacture has a significant impact on airline service\u000a      costs and aero engine\u000a      manufacturer profitability. The optimisation of properties is achieved\u000a      through the reduction or\u000a      elimination of crystal grain boundaries (i.e. single crystal growth) and\u000a      the appropriate selection of\u000a      the grain orientation to reduce deformation (creep) from the centrifugal\u000a      stresses in the engine. This\u000a      is exactly what the research insights outlined in section 2 allows one to\u000a      control.\u000a    The FIB-SIMS work has also been helpful in understanding the mechanisms\u000a      of high temperature\u000a      oxidation of the melt and its interaction with the mould wall. This has\u000a      enabled casting surface scale\u000a      to be tackled, allowing larger single crystal castings to be used in new\u000a      engines at an economically\u000a      acceptable cost without suffering from excessive scrap rates.\u000a    The FIB-SIMS technique development has also enabled the role of Y in bond\u000a      coats to be quantified\u000a      in follow-up work at Imperial. These are the interlayers that act as Al\u000a      reservoirs and diffusion\u000a      barriers between the metallic blade and the insulating ceramic thermal\u000a      barrier coatings. This has\u000a      enabled improved PtAl-based bond costs to be implemented in production,\u000a      enabling further life\/\u000a      temperature improvements to be achieved.\u000a    A Materials Technologist at Rolls-Royce Plc notes:\u000a      \"the research collaboratively with Imperial College addressed the\u000a        mechanism for the formation of\u000a        stray grains ... [and] was instrumental in the design of a novel grain\u000a        selector that successfully\u000a        enables the \"filtering\" of these stray grains and ensuring casting\u000a        conformance. This has resulted in\u000a        publications in peer reviewed journals...as well as two granted patents\u000a        for the grain selector....The\u000a        collaboration with Imperial College has been important in identifying\u000a        the role of the as-cast oxide\u000a        that forms during solidification and that plays a crucial role during\u000a        solutioning.\" [D].\u000a    Quantitative Estimate of the impact\u000a      Scrap rates in the production of these type of blades due to\u000a      non-conformance in 1993 were ~50%\u000a      and are now reduced to ~10%. This improvement leads to a ~&#163;300m\/yr savings\u000a      in waste material\u000a      and processing (based on a cost per blade of &#163;100 and typical production\u000a      rates). A lower bound on\u000a      Imperial's contribution to this of 5% gives a saving of &gt;&#163;100m over the\u000a      last decade attributable to\u000a      the casting research. The ability to grow single crystals with an improved\u000a      yield made it\u000a      economically feasible to manufacture larger single crystal castings,\u000a      leading to the ability to raise\u000a      turbine entry temperatures, which impacts on fuel burn and consequently\u000a      fuel cost and CO2\u000a      emissions, improving competitiveness. A 10K increase in temperature\u000a      capability equates to about\u000a      0.5% increase in fuel efficiency. A Rolls Royce specialist in nickel\u000a      alloys notes that:\u000a      \"It has been estimated that an increase in compressor discharge\u000a        temperature of 30C produces\u000a        0.3% less specific fuel consumption per engine. For a large twin engine\u000a        aircraft flying from London\u000a        to New York, a 0.3% SFC equates to a 700kg reduction in fuel\u000a        consumption, which translates to a\u000a        reduction of ~2.25tonnes of CO2 emissions per flight.\" [E]\u000a    The 2012 estimated fuel costs of the airline industry were $210bn, and as\u000a      Rolls-Royce has ~40%\u000a      of the market their increased temperature capability allows a saving of\u000a      $420m\/year in fuel, or 2.6\u000a      million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This reduction in running\u000a      costs makes Rolls-Royce engines\u000a      attractive to airlines and has allowed the company to grow its market\u000a      share. The improvement in\u000a      10K material capability and the subsequent saving of $420m\/yr can be\u000a      assigned to developments\u000a      across Ni superalloy research. The importance of this improved casting\u000a      process has had a\u000a      significant impact on the fortunes of Rolls-Royce Plc - this was\u000a      highlighted in an Economist article\u000a      on April 21st 2012, which states:\u000a    \"But some things are not for sharing because they are too important to\u000a        preserve a product's\u000a        competitive advantage. For Rolls-Royce, turbine blades are one of those\u000a        key technologies. The\u000a        magic that creates them depends on a deep understanding of materials\u000a        science and production\u000a        technology. When metals solidify after casting they normally contain\u000a        lots of microscopic crystals.\u000a        That would still leave them strong enough for most things, but it is a\u000a        potential weakness in a\u000a        turbine blade. So Rolls-Royce uses a unique system which casts the blade\u000a        in a nickel-based\u000a        super-alloy with a continuous and unbroken crystalline structure. This\u000a        ensures there will be no\u000a        structural defects.\" [F]\u000a    2. FIB SIMs: O interstitials in titanium\u000a    The compressor and fan blades of a jet engine are made of titanium alloys\u000a      because of their\u000a      superior density-normalised fatigue strength. Hollow fan blades are made\u000a      by diffusion bonding and\u000a      vacuum brazing processes that can be difficult to control. As near-final\u000a      manufacturing processes\u000a      they are impossible to non-destructively inspect and therefore any\u000a      variability must be tightly\u000a      controlled. This has been enabled by the techniques developed by Shollock\u000a      and used by Dye to\u000a      understand and help improve the production process. A Rolls-Royce Fellow\u000a      provides details of fuel\u000a      consumption savings and CO2 emissions and explains how oxygen diffusion\u000a      measurements and\u000a      the development of an algorithm to predict the thickness of oxidation\u000a      damage as a function of time\u000a      and temperature were \"beneficial to Rolls-Royce plc.\"\u000a    \"The use of FIB SIMS depth profiling of interstitials in `good' and\u000a        `bad' microstructures enabled the\u000a        root cause for variability in the manufacturing process to be defined as\u000a        nucleation driven from\u000a        surface topography rather than via a chemistry change. ... Whilst the\u000a        benefit associated with this\u000a        work is difficult to quantify in direct financial terms, the\u000a        manufacturing changes are being\u000a        implemented in order to reduce the probability of fan blade failures in\u000a        service. The direct cost to the\u000a        company is ~&#163;5M per failure event.\"[G]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Rolls-Royce has been able to reduce manufacturing scrap rates\u000a      significantly, better control the\u000a      single crystal growth process for nickel superalloy blades and more\u000a      confidently understand\u000a      production issues in Ti blades. The lower bound saving for the Imperial\u000a      contribution to the work is\u000a      estimated at &#163;100M p.a. This has contributed to the production of a jet\u000a      engine with better fuel\u000a      efficiency, increased cost effectiveness due to lower scrap rate and\u000a      improved time on wing for\u000a      fleets in service.\u000a    Jet engine modifications account for over half the fuel efficiency\u000a      improvements in modern aircraft,\u000a      with the industry accounting for a large share of UK visible exports.\u000a      Improvements in gas turbine\u000a      technology offer jet fuel (cost and CO2) savings and support UK\u000a      employment. Titanium alloys in\u000a      the cooler sections and nickel alloys in the hot sections are the subject\u000a      of this case study.\u000a    The engines consist of Ti or Ni alloy discs attached to a series of\u000a      shafts which are turned by\u000a      aerofoils (blades) in the gas stream. Incoming air is accelerated by the\u000a      fan section then\u000a      compressed, mixed with fuel and burned, with the energy then being\u000a      extracted by the turbine.\u000a      Turbine blades operate in a gas stream at 1800+ K, 200 K greater than the\u000a      alloy melting point, and\u000a      extract up to 700 kW per blade to power the fan and compressor. Each disc\u000a      holds around 60\u000a      blades, with around 9 turbine stages in a large engine. In titanium,\u000a      failure of a fan blade or multiple\u000a      blades is extremely costly (&#163;5M per event) and of course poses safety\u000a      issues.

The\u000a      specific research insights that have\u000a      had significant impacts on the science and technology of jet engines are\u000a      as follows.\u000a    1. Predicting the microstructure of nickel superalloy blades:\u000a        porosity, grain orientation and\u000a        the effect on creep\u000a    With the support of an EPSRC Grant GR\/L05433\/01 (Dec 1996-Sept 2000) Dr\u000a      Shollock and\u000a      Professor McLean investigated the effects of well-controlled directional\u000a      solidification conditions on\u000a      the microstructures of nickel-base superalloys. The combination of\u000a      controlled directional\u000a      solidification and detailed crystallographic characterisation provided the\u000a      most comprehensive\u000a      information at that time on the correlation of solidification conditions\u000a      with microstructure.\u000a      Specifically it was found that:\u000a    \u000a      increasing the solid-liquid interface allowed better grain orientation\u000a        control,\u000a      stability of grains depended on their orientation and\u000a      minor differences in alloy composition can affect the stabilisation of\u000a        grains [1].\u000a    \u000a    In follow-on work in 2002\/3, led by Professors McLean with Lee and\u000a      supported by Rolls Royce,\u000a      Special Metals Wiggin and Wyman-Gordon, a combined cellular\u000a      automaton-finite difference (CA-FD)\u000a      model was developed to simulate the solidification process. It was found\u000a      that for nickel\u000a      superalloys the dendrite spacing selection (achieved by branching and\u000a      dendrite competition)\u000a      exhibited hysteresis. It was found that perturbation of the growth\u000a      velocity affects both the primary\u000a      dendrite arm spacing and tip undercooling - the primary dendrite arm\u000a      spacing has a much narrower\u000a      distribution after perturbation. The upper limit of the distribution of\u000a      primary dendrite arm spacing is\u000a      about twice the lower limit. Thus, the primary spacing was found to be\u000a      dependent not only on the\u000a      current growth conditions, but also on the way in which those conditions\u000a      were reached [2].\u000a      These research findings were successful in allowing model-based casting\u000a      design to be employed,\u000a      so as to minimise stray grain formation and to control primary and\u000a      secondary orientation in single\u000a      crystal castings. Extension of this work was carried out with EPSRC grant\u000a      EP\/R78992\/019\u000a      (Oct2002-Mar2006) led by Professor Lee and Dr Dye, which introduced a\u000a      methodology (weighted\u000a      interval rank sort) that allowed the spatial variation of composition\u000a      (microsegregation) to be more\u000a      accurately estimated [3]. In linked work Professor Lee also determined\u000a      that porosity was a major\u000a      crack initiator and large pores close to the surface played an important\u000a      role determining the fatigue\u000a      life of cast components. It was established that the average size of pores\u000a      as well as their spatial\u000a      and size distribution in a component are also important. A statistical\u000a      model was developed which\u000a      successfully predicted fatigue life due to porosity population [4].\u000a    In 2006 research resumed on creep in superalloys, based on the historical\u000a      activity in this area by\u000a      Professor McLean, using support from an EPSRC platform grant, GR\/T26344\/01\u000a      (Feb 2005-Jan2010)\u000a      and a further grant, EP\/C536312\/1 (Oct 2005- 2009). Of specific relevance\u000a      is the\u000a      development of a truly physically-based model by Dr Dye allowing the\u000a      features of superalloy creep\u000a      to be recovered i.e. dependence upon microstructure and its scale, effect\u000a      of lattice misfit, internal\u000a      stress relaxation, incubation phenomena and the interrelationship of\u000a      tertiary and primary creep,\u000a      and vacancy condensation leading to damage accumulation. The model\u000a      provided predictive\u000a      capability of the microstructural factors accounting for creep.\u000a    2. FIB-SIMs, O interstitials and degradation of alloys\u000a    Dr Shollock developed a combination of O isotope exchange, focussed ion\u000a      beam milling and\u000a      secondary isotope mass spectrometry (FIB-SIMS) in the late 90s, primarily\u000a      to develop insight into\u000a      the oxidation mechanisms of nickel superalloys [5][6]. This allowed depth\u000a      profiling of O at the\u000a      nanoscale, elucidating the mechanisms by which multi-layer and multi-phase\u000a      oxide scales grow, in\u000a      what order and understanding which are truly protective. In addition\u000a      insight was gained into the\u000a      formation processes of the brittle intermetallics in the secondary\u000a      reaction zone and the porosity\u000a      (vacancy accumulation) at the interfaces. More recently, this has been\u000a      extended to the use of FIB-SIMS\u000a      to measure and quantify interstitial concentration profiles in titanium\u000a      alloys, in a PhD thesis\u000a      published in 2013 \"Controlling the interstitial element concentration in\u000a      Ti-6Al-4V using\u000a      Calciothermic Reduction\" by Moorhouse (supervised by Dr Shollock). It was\u000a      determined that with\u000a      careful selection of the FIB-SIMS parameters one could correctly quantify\u000a      the interstitial\u000a      concentrations in titanium alloys and obtain oxygen concentration\u000a      profiles.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42173","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    \u000a      Grimes' work on nuclear fuel performance and waste behaviour, in\u000a        particular on radiation damage of nuclear materials (references 1 and 2)\u000a        has led to him becoming arguably the UKs leading nuclear scientist\u000a        (sources A,B).

Grimes's and Lee's influence was clearly\u000a        demonstrated in the recent report of the Ad Hoc Nuclear R&amp;D\u000a        Advisory Board chaired by the Government chief scientific adviser (CSA)\u000a        with Grimes as member (source C) which made several recommendations to\u000a        Government including the setting up of a National Nuclear R&amp;D\u000a        Advisory Board, a National Nuclear Users Facility and a strong programme\u000a        of R&amp;D in support of geological disposal all of which the Government\u000a        has begun to put in place (source D). Grimes has been working with the\u000a        Foreign and Commonwealth Office Science and Innovation Team promoting UK\u000a        nuclear research capabilities, particularly in India (leading to an\u000a        EPSRC-India portfolio of joint projects) and SE Asia, and was appointed\u000a        Chief Scientific Advisor to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Feb.\u000a        2013.\u000a      Lee's unique understanding of the processing and durability of\u000a        vitreous and ceramic waste forms (references 4-6) gave him the expertise\u000a        to be appointed CoRWM Deputy Chair in Oct 2007. CoRWM has since had a\u000a        major influence on the Government's &#163;multi-billion MRWS programme via\u000a        its scrutiny and advice role to DECC (specifically the Energy Minister\u000a        and Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change) and the Nuclear\u000a        Decommissioning Authority (NDA). Lee lead the CoRWM R&amp;D Group form\u000a        2007-13 and met regularly with the research leaders of the NDA, RWMD,\u000a        NNL, Sellafield Sites, EdF Energy, RCUK (EPSRC\/NERC) offering formal and\u000a        informal scrutiny and advice. This culminated in the CoRWM R&amp;D\u000a        Report (2009) whose 6 key recommendations (source E) were reported to\u000a        the HoLSTC (source F) and where possible at this stage in the MRWS\u000a        programme, have mostly been accepted and acted upon by Government.\u000a        Specifically, his work on the concept of glass composite materials\u000a        (reference 4) had led to the UK now developing such waste forms through\u000a        development work at Sellafield Sites plc using thermal methods such as\u000a        plasma melting to host some of the ill-defined wastes in the Sellafield\u000a        Legacy Ponds and Silos. These represent the biggest threat to UK\u000a        security and cost &#163;70M\/annum just to keep in their current state.\u000a      As an example, the first CoRWM recommendation (source E) on improved\u000a        coordination of the UKs radwaste R&amp;D programme led directly to\u000a        changes to the NDAs Research Board while another recommendation\u000a        influenced the process by which outside users can access the NNLs active\u000a        facilities. As CoRWM Deputy Chair Lee had regular meetings with the CEO\u000a        of the NDA, the DECC Chief Scientific Advisor, the Energy Minister, the\u000a        Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change as well as leading\u000a        civil servants in the DECC nuclear team. These meetings influenced\u000a        Government waste management policy specifically in the repository\u000a        volunteerism process, additional support from RCUK for waste R&amp;D and\u000a        greater participation in international programmes.\u000a      In his supporting letter (source G) the CoRWM Chair highlights\u000a        reference 4 as one of the reasons for Lee's appointment to CoRWM and\u000a        lists areas where CoRWM's R&amp;D Report had influence including in \"the\u000a        establishment of an Advisory Board on Nuclear R&amp;D, chaired by the\u000a        Government Chief Scientific Advisor, with a remit that includes R&amp;D\u000a        related to management of legacy and new build radioactive wastes\".\u000a      CoRWM also does a significant amount of public engagement and this has\u000a        led to several radio appearances and work with public and other\u000a        stakeholders in the UK (source H) and abroad (e.g. Bure, France).\u000a        Grimes' high media profile (source H) and TV\/radio appearances during\u000a        the Fukushima accident were responsible for the UK public remaining\u000a        positive about the nuclear option (source B).\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Through strategic national roles Grimes and Lee have had a major impact\u000a      on the expansion of the UKs nuclear R&amp;D programme since 2000 and on\u000a      directing Government policy in the nuclear sector.

His work (e.g. reference 1) led to a\u000a      fundamental understanding of the underlying physical processes that\u000a      control key performance properties such as fission gas retention and\u000a      thermal conductivity. He has been the international leader in predicting\u000a      how fission products behave in fuel for over 20 years and was recently the\u000a      first to publish papers on dislocations in fuel, which control creep of\u000a      fuel during reactor operation. This industry focus led to sponsorship from\u000a      British Energy (now EdF Energy), Westinghouse and most recently the\u000a      Rolls-Royce Nuclear University Technology Centre (UTC). Equivalent work in\u000a      ceramic waste form performance and radiation damage behaviour has resulted\u000a      in collaborations and sponsorship from Los Alamos National Laboratory and\u000a      the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). His\u000a      work has identified radiation tolerant ceramic waste host materials and\u000a      ensembles of phases (reference 2) for composite waste forms, including the\u000a      first predictions of glass-crystal interface structures and partition of\u000a      fission products between phases. Grimes has unequivocally demonstrated the\u000a      central role that modelling and simulation must play in the development of\u000a      nuclear materials. His publication of articles such as that in Science\u000a      (reference 3) provide a technical assessment of current and future reactor\u000a      and fuel cycle options for the UK specifically but also globally, thereby\u000a      outlining direction for the development of nuclear energy.\u000a    Lee's research has provided unique understanding of the processing and\u000a      durability of vitreous and ceramic nuclear waste forms (references 4-6).\u000a      Specifically, his work on the concept of glass composite materials\u000a      (reference 4) highlighted the potential for waste form materials between\u000a      the ostensibly completely amorphous glass waste hosts (such as the\u000a      borosilicate glasses used by the UK and France for their High Level\u000a      Wastes, HLWs) and fully crystalline ceramic waste forms (such as Synroc,\u000a      Synthetic Rock now marketed by ANSTO). References 4 and 5 developed\u000a      fundamental understanding of the various mechanisms for crystal formation\u000a      in simulant HLW glasses and led to the concept of making durable waste\u000a      forms containing crystals. Previously it had been assumed the presence of\u000a      such crystals would inevitably be detrimental to the waste forms\u000a      durability. Reference 6 used this understanding to demonstrate the\u000a      application of glass composite materials to a significant UK waste stream\u000a      and that the resulting waste form was durable. Large volumes of difficult,\u000a      ill-defined, radioactive wastes at sites such as Sellafield and Hanford in\u000a      the USA have led to this sensible engineering approach being adopted\u000a      worldwide.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42174","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Low NOx Burners Savings of ~&#163;1Mpa\u000d\u000a    Unburned carbon in power station ash represents a loss in combustion\u000d\u000a      efficiency, but this is mitigated by electrostatic separation of\u000d\u000a      pulverised fuel ash (pfa) into ash fractions with low and high carbon.\u000d\u000a      This enables the low carbon pfa to be marketed as a cement replacement\u000d\u000a      material, while the pfa fractions with higher carbon contents provided\u000d\u000a      ashes containing sufficient carbon for them to be used as a low cost fuel.\u000d\u000a      The research programme and subsequent boiler trials showed that addition\u000d\u000a      of pfa to a coal not only produced no undesirable boiler effects, but in\u000d\u000a      fact increased the overall combustion efficiency and provided increased\u000d\u000a      amounts of a saleable slag and pfa.

The reduction in CO2emissions\u000a        is massive and it has led the industry as a whole to look at unit\u000d\u000a        conversions as a viable option for old coal fired power stations.\"\u000d\u000a      [C]\u000d\u000a    The trials at Tilbury did indeed encourage the industry to implement the\u000d\u000a      use of the process and in July 2012 Drax Power Ltd announced that it would\u000d\u000a      transform itself into a mainly biomass-fueled energy generator, and is now\u000d\u000a      converting three of its six generating units. The Tilbury Biomass\u000d\u000a      experiment demonstrated the viability and the experiment at Tilbury has\u000d\u000a      now ended, pending the outcome of Government decisions regarding new\u000d\u000a      energy contracts to be announced in 2014.\u000d\u000a    The situation regarding the production of biomass boilers is extremely\u000d\u000a      encouraging and business is buoyant.

A research group, led by Professor Jim Williamson, in\u000d\u000a      the Department of Materials, had for some years been characterising UK\u000d\u000a      coals, mineral matter, ashes and slags to provide the basis for\u000d\u000a      improvements in the methods used for predicting the slagging and fouling\u000d\u000a      propensity of the coals. It should be noted that the cost of lost power\u000d\u000a      generation and maintenance for each unscheduled boiler outage that occurs\u000d\u000a      as a result of fouling, was several million pounds.\u000d\u000a    The ability of the generators to purchase overseas coals was seen by the\u000d\u000a      power companies as a way of reducing, or at least stabilising, UK\u000d\u000a      electricity prices. However, many of the world traded coals were of a very\u000d\u000a      different nature to the UK coals, and lacked essential data on combustion\u000d\u000a      behaviour. Imperial College London, with the backing of industry, agreed\u000d\u000a      to an increased research activity that would assist the power companies\u000d\u000a      with the choice of new coals, provide data on combustion behaviour,\u000d\u000a      gaseous and solid emissions and predictions for boiler performance.\u000d\u000a    Research groups established in the Departments of Materials, Mechanical\u000d\u000a      and Chemical Engineering, achieved international recognition, and with\u000d\u000a      this, came substantial new funding from the power companies, EPSRC, EPRI\u000d\u000a      and the European Coal and Steel Research Fund. In the Department of\u000d\u000a      Materials, a 1600&#176;C entrained flow reactor (EFR) was designed and built\u000d\u000a      (Ian Hutchings, October 1993) to provide a facility that would simulate\u000d\u000a      the time and temperature conditions experienced by coal particles in a\u000d\u000a      full-sized, pulverised, coal-fired boiler. The reactor provided combustion\u000d\u000a      products that were characterised using computer controlled scanning\u000d\u000a      electron microscopy (CCSEM)(Fraser Wigley, since February 1993) and\u000d\u000a      techniques were developed to characterise the complex nature of the coal\u000d\u000a      mineral distributions and the nature of the combustion products (1). The\u000d\u000a      facilities enabled key combustion parameters to be established using the\u000d\u000a      relatively small quantities of overseas coals that were on offer (2). Coal\u000d\u000a      research in the Department of Materials concentrated on some of the major\u000d\u000a      issues that were confronting the power generation industry. These included\u000d\u000a      improved techniques for predicting the slagging and fouling propensity of\u000d\u000a      a coal ash (3)(Fraser Wigley, Nick Manton, Nigel Russell, since 1990),\u000d\u000a      prediction of NOx emissions (Fraser Wigley and Jim Williamson, 1998-2002),\u000d\u000a      the effects on ash slagging using blended coals, the origins of the\u000d\u000a      unburned carbon in ash, the fate of trace elements in a coal on combustion\u000d\u000a      and gasification (Fraser Wigley, Andy Bushell, 1995-2000), predicting the\u000d\u000a      erosive and abrasive properties of a pulverised coal (4)(Jon Wells,\u000d\u000a      2002-2004), the characterisation of biomasses and the interactions of a\u000d\u000a      co-fired biomass ash with a coal ash (5)(Fraser Wigley, 2001-2008).\u000d\u000a    Underpinning science leading to two key impacts\u000d\u000a    The results of these studies enabled the power generators to meet\u000d\u000a      restrictions on gaseous emissions, the targets set for CO2\u000d\u000a      reductions and to increase the proportion of electricity generated from\u000d\u000a      renewable sources. Improvements in boiler performance provided savings to\u000d\u000a      the industry (and consumers) estimated at millions of pounds. Two projects\u000d\u000a      described below have been chosen to illustrate the impact that these\u000d\u000a      studies had on power station performance.\u000d\u000a    1 Low NOx Burners Savings of ~&#163;1Mpa\u000d\u000a    The retrofitting of low NOx burners reduced the NOx emissions but\u000d\u000a      produced\u000d\u000a    (a) an ash with a higher carbon content,\u000d\u000a    (b) reduced amounts of saleable bottom slag, and\u000d\u000a    (c) a pfa with a finer particle size that placed an increased load on the\u000d\u000a      electrostatic precipitators.\u000d\u000a    Studies showed that the lower flame temperatures produced by low NOx\u000d\u000a      burners produced ash particles that were less sticky, with a reduced\u000d\u000a      tendency to agglomerate. The initial combustion conditions being less\u000d\u000a      oxidising reduced the conditions required for a high carbon burnout, with\u000d\u000a      the boiler now requiring more coal to provide the same thermal out-put. An\u000d\u000a      initial programme of mineral and pfa additions to a coal made use of the\u000d\u000a      EFR, providing deposits, combustion and cyclone ashes, each of which was\u000d\u000a      subjected to detailed chemical and microstructural characterisation (6).\u000d\u000a      The initial success of the project was followed with trials using the RWE\u000d\u000a      0.5 MW combustion test facility (CTF) which allowed an increased range of\u000d\u000a      flame characteristics and boiler conditions to be monitored. The success\u000d\u000a      of the CTF trials then lead to a full-scale boiler implementation of pfa\u000d\u000a      additions to a coal at an RWE npower power station using a 600 MW boiler.\u000d\u000a    2 Use of Biomass &#8212; savings of ~&#163;40M-&#163;70M pa\u000d\u000a    Combustion of biomass is considered to be an essentially CO2-neutral\u000a      process, but biomass combustion alone has an efficiency limited to ~35%,\u000d\u000a      when co-fired with coal at higher temperatures, the efficiency rises to\u000d\u000a      43%. However, the effects of the inorganic components of biomass on boiler\u000d\u000a      ash behaviour was of major concern since the alkalis present in a biomass,\u000d\u000a      namely high levels of CaO, MgO, K2O, Na2O and P2O5,\u000d\u000a      can significantly reduce the viscosity of the coal ash producing sticky\u000d\u000a      ash particles with enhanced deposition rates and changes to both ash\u000d\u000a      slagging and fouling behaviour. Power generators had therefore proceeded\u000d\u000a      with much caution concerning the amount of coal to be replaced by biomass,\u000d\u000a      limiting replacement to 5 to 10 wt% of the coal for fear of producing\u000d\u000a      intractable slags and fouling deposits. The aims of a study funded by the\u000d\u000a      DTI under the New and Renewable Energy Programme, with additional support\u000d\u000a      from Mitsui Babcock, E.ON and RWE npower, were to establish the upper\u000d\u000a      limit of coal replacement before serious slagging and fouling problems\u000d\u000a      occurred. The studies at Imperial College London made use of the EFR, used\u000d\u000a      a variety of UK and imported coals, with five biomass types, namely\u000d\u000a      miscanthus, olive waste, sawdust, cereal straws and switch grass. Biomass\u000d\u000a      additions to the coal ranged from 5 to 40 wt% of the coal ash. Ash and\u000d\u000a      deposits were subjected to detailed microstructural, studies, chemical\u000d\u000a      analysis and calculated ash viscosities. Ash deposition rates were\u000d\u000a      determined from the proportion of ash retained on deposition probes.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42334","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Process\/events from research to impact\u000a    EDF Energy first commissioned research into the use of intelligent\u000a      analysis techniques applied to condition monitoring data gathered from\u000a      their fleet of Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) stations in September\u000a      2003.

IMAPS has changed working practice within EDF Energy as it\u000a      is now the recognized repository for storage of all condition monitoring\u000a      observations made at the MAP meetings, and is stated in the formal\u000a      Departmental Instruction documentation for each station involved.\u000a      Furthermore, IMAPS has become the first point of call for the graphite\u000a      core project team whenever an issue arises with a fuel channel, as it\u000a      contains the most up-to-date verified information relating to the\u000a      condition of the channel, along with useful historical information. \"The\u000a        IMAPS system is consistently used to view the history of a fuel channel\u000a        as the principal data is displayed immediately with links to more\u000a        detailed information in our document management system. In addition,\u000a        IMAPS is used to assist in the selection of channels for inspection\u000a        during an outage\" [Source 3 Monitoring Team Leader EDF].\u000a    The systems have proved extremely beneficial to EDF Energy as they\u000a      provide a rapid and auditable manner of assessing Fuel Grab Load Trace\u000a      data. Further, the systems provide a means of managing and trending large\u000a      volumes of condition monitoring data, which provides supporting evidence\u000a      to the claims that the reactors are currently healthy, thus supporting the\u000a      safety case for continued operation. \"The BETA and IMAPS systems\u000a        directly support the analysis of our core condition monitoring data\u000a        which feeds into the monitoring leg of our safety case for continued and\u000a        future station operation\" [Source 4].\u000a    Reducing the risk to energy supply by extending lifetime of nuclear\u000a        power stations: Another impact is on the energy supply available to\u000a      UK consumers, via the Department of Energy and Climate Change's policy on\u000a      \"Maintaining UK energy security.\" In the wider societal context, keeping\u000a      the existing nuclear power plants generating, and extending their\u000a      operational lifetimes, providing it is safe to do so, is of great\u000a      significance to the UK. Civil nuclear power generation plays a substantial\u000a      role in the UK's current energy mix, by providing low carbon, base load\u000a      generation. In 2012, 63.9TWh of electricity was supplied by nuclear power\u000a      in the UK, which is equivalent to 18.5% of all electricity supplied, and\u000a      the AGR stations supplied over 83% of this electricity.\u000a    In December 2007, the oldest power stations Hunterston B and Hinkley\u000a      Point B were granted 5-year operational extensions to 2016, and a further\u000a      7-year extension to these stations was announced on 4th December 2012. In\u000a      2010, both Heysham 1 and Hartlepool were granted 5-year operational\u000a      extensions to 2019, and it is likely that the case will be made for\u000a      further extensions in the future for these newer stations. Dungeness B,\u000a      Torness and Heysham 2 are newer still and the likelihood is that similar\u000a      extensions will be sought. Without the existing nuclear generation\u000a      portfolio, the UK would be facing a significant gap of about 19% of total\u000a      demand in its energy supply, and though new stations are planned, these\u000a      are not due to come online for at least another 8-10 years. Furthermore,\u000a      the upcoming energy crisis that the UK risks facing was highlighted by\u000a      Ofgem, which stated on 27th June 2013, that \"electricity\u000a        supplies are set to tighten faster than previously expected in the\u000a        middle of this decade\" [Source 6]. Extended operation of the\u000a      existing nuclear power plants mitigates some of this risk to supply,\u000a      without which the country would be facing the increased possibility of the\u000a      lights going out. The likelihood of this occurring is part of the current\u000a      public energy debate, but what is clear is that extended operation is\u000a      beneficial to security of supply.\u000a    Influence on international planning: Though the algorithms are\u000a      specific to the AGR design of reactors, the wider international community\u000a      benefits from the lessons learned from deploying such systems for lifetime\u000a      extension. Dr West was a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency\u000a      (IAEA) co-ordinated research program entitled: \"Advanced Surveillance,\u000a        Diagnostics, and Prognostics Techniques used for Health Monitoring of\u000a        Systems, Structures and Components in Nuclear Power Plants\" which\u000a      focussed on the latest developments in techniques to support continued and\u000a      extended operation of nuclear power plants worldwide [Source 5].

Seven out of the eight civil nuclear power stations in the UK\u000a      are of the 2nd Generation Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) design. The\u000a      initial design lifetimes of some of the stations has now passed and there\u000a      is a desire to keep operating these stations. For the Office for Nuclear\u000a      Regulation to grant extensions to the licenses to operate them, the\u000a      operator (EDF Energy) is required to submit a safety case. This safety\u000a      case is a collection of documents detailing why it is safe to continue\u000a      operating the stations, and the monitoring and inspection regimes to back\u000a      these claims up. The major life-limiting factor on these stations is the\u000a      condition of the graphite core, which provides structural integrity for\u000a      housing the uranium fuel and acts as the neutron moderator. Inspection of\u000a      the reactor core during routine outages every 2-3 years, provides\u000a      information relating to the health of the core, and forms one aspect of\u000a      the safety case. Manual analysis of condition monitoring data, gathered\u000a      during routine operation, supplements the detailed inspection information\u000a      and forms another leg of the safety case. Manual analysis of this data is\u000a      time consuming, requires specialist expert knowledge and can suffer from\u000a      variations in human judgment between experts. EDF Energy recognised that\u000a      as their stations age there is a requirement to analyse an ever increasing\u000a      volume of condition monitoring data, and that manually analysing this data\u000a      would become more and more costly in terms of time to undertake the\u000a      analysis and the level of expertise required. Therefore, development and\u000a      deployment of robust, automated analysis techniques to assess this\u000a      condition monitoring data was required.\u000a    Key Findings: To address these challenges, research into\u000a      identification and benchmarking of normal reactor behaviour through data\u000a      mining of historical data was undertaken, leading to the creation of\u000a      statistical anomaly detection algorithms. In addition, knowledge\u000a      elicitation and modelling of domain expertise relating to the analysis of\u000a      fuel grab load trace data resulted in a prototype knowledge-based system\u000a      for graphite brick crack detection [1]. A key challenge was to ensure that\u000a      the results of these automated analysis techniques were suitably robust\u000a      and auditable for use within nuclear facilities. Further research enhanced\u000a      the analysis through the application of novel feature identification\u000a      algorithms derived from advances in the Artificial Intelligence and the\u000a      machine learning community; these algorithms were applied to the automatic\u000a      detection of important artefacts in Fuel Grab Load Trace (FGLT) data, a\u000a      primary indicator of core distortion [2]. Subsequent funding focussed on\u000a      taking these prototype systems and deploying them as robust, industrial\u000a      strength systems, accessible via EDF Energy's company intranet. Use of the\u000a      systems by EDF energy graphite core engineers allowed significant volumes\u000a      of operational data to be gathered and analysed, which opened up new\u000a      research challenges in developing techniques for trending and\u000a      characterising this data [3]. Additional challenges addressed at this\u000a      point involved developing a framework to fuse together condition\u000a      monitoring data arising from multiple different data sources to provide\u000a      core-wide condition monitoring [4].\u000a    The outcome of the novel research was the development, implementation and\u000a      adoption of two production grade systems, BETA and IMAPS, for the storage\u000a      and automated analysis of reactor core condition monitoring data [5]. Both\u000a      systems have had their 3rd major version release onto the EDF\u000a      Energy company intranet, demonstrating the path from novel analysis\u000a      techniques, to prototype demonstrator, to robust deployed systems\u000a      providing beneficial decision support to the continued operation of the\u000a      nuclear power stations in the UK.\u000a    Key Researchers at Strathclyde: This research was undertaken by\u000a      the following staff in the Department of Electronic and Electrical\u000a      Engineering :\u000a    \u000a      Prof Stephen McArthur &#8212; appointed 1993.

The\u000a      work was funded by\u000a      the two DTI programmes noted in section 3 and supported by two EPSRC CASE\u000a      studentships\u000a      (Duffin and McGettrick noted above). Our partners (including OptoSci\u000a      Ltd.), with CMP support,\u000a      carried out the engineering development to prototype level and implemented\u000a      the further\u000a      development (OptoSci only) to full commercial product including the\u000a      necessary field trials and\u000a      qualification. OptoSci Ltd. worked in partnership with the research group\u000a      generating the key\u000a      outcomes during the entire process of basic research through technology\u000a      transfer to commercial\u000a      product, and continues to do so for future products arising from similar\u000a      research. OptoSci Ltd. was\u000a      a partner in the DTI Link project, OMEGA, in which the multi-point system\u000a      was initially developed.\u000a      The company also sponsored the PhD student, Kevin Duffin, and was a\u000a      partner in the DTI\u000a      REALMS project in which the calibration free algorithms were developed.\u000a    Nature of the impact: The benefits of this technology are due\u000a      primarily to the fact that no power is\u000a      required at the sensor head, making the system intrinsically safe.\u000a      Electrical shut down in an\u000a      emergency situation (particularly crucial for mining) does not affect the\u000a      performance of the multi-point\u000a      optical detection system, which continues to inform the operators and\u000a      rescue teams of the\u000a      gas conditions in the incident zone. This brings enormous safety benefits\u000a      and informs and widens\u000a      the range of intervention \/ rescue options. Other benefits are the\u000a      economic impacts arising from\u000a      expansion of OptoSci's business through the new product line, creating\u000a      employment, international\u000a      sales, profits to shareholders and a reduction in costs to industry, where\u000a      the new technology has\u000a      been adopted. Other commercial companies are now trying to emulate\u000a      multi-point systems using\u000a      optical fibre networks, but, to the best of our knowledge, none has been\u000a      successful to date.\u000a    1. Economic benefits: The most immediate impact is economic. The\u000a      technology has been fully\u000a      adopted by OptoSci Ltd., commercial products have been developed (Source\u000a      A) and sales have\u000a      been made, thus supporting existing jobs and leading to job creation\u000a      (three new engineering jobs\u000a      since 2009 with more anticipated in the coming year). Barriers to sales in\u000a      safety critical markets are\u000a      high, with differing qualifications required in different countries, and\u000a      conservatism in the industry\u000a      regarding the introduction of new, unproven technologies being the main\u000a      obstacles. Hence,\u000a      significant early sales after product launch are unusual. Despite such\u000a      barriers, sales, starting in\u000a      late 2010 and driven by the technical, operational and cost benefits of\u000a      the new products, have\u000a      reached a total of &#163;250k (including export sales to Japan, Hong Kong,\u000a      China and the USA). In\u000a      addition, a contract worth &#163;193k has been signed (May 2013), to customise\u000a      and deliver systems\u000a      over the coming year to a consortium of the UK gas distribution networks\u000a      including Scotia Gas\u000a      Networks, Northern Gas networks, National Grid Gas Networks and Southern\u000a      Gas Networks\u000a      (Source B). Given the increased commercial sales and business growth from\u000a      the new product\u000a      range, the shareholders, directors and employees of OptoSci Ltd. are the\u000a      immediate beneficiaries\u000a      in terms of business \/ employment sustainability and growth. A researcher\u000a      from EEE at Strathclyde\u000a      was employed by OptoSci from 2009-13 to support the commercial activities\u000a      arising from the\u000a      research outcomes. A second researcher from EEE at Strathclyde is now\u000a      employed by the\u000a      company in this role. Two further engineering employees have been\u000a      appointed so far to support\u000a      the new product range and further appointments are planned over the coming\u000a      year.\u000a    In addition, economic benefit accrues to companies and organisations\u000a      involved in mining and gas\u000a      processing sectors through the technical and operational benefits of the\u000a      technology. The Director\u000a      of OptoSci has stated that the Strathclyde technology \"brings\u000a        significant and unique human safety\u000a        benefits to mining and gas (methane) production, storage, piping and\u000a        transport systems. Other\u000a        benefits to the purchaser include low cost of ownership through high\u000a        reliability (little need for\u000a        maintenance) and consistent accuracy in operation. We believe that this\u000a        product \/ technology is\u000a        vastly superior to any gas sensing products currently used for the\u000a        detection of methane in mines\u000a        etc. As such, it is the focus for all future business growth within the\u000a        company.\" (Source B).\u000a    2. Reduction in Costs to Industry: Elimination of the need to\u000a      re-calibrate the sensor heads and\u000a      their high reliability results in long periods between maintenance and\u000a      little need for head\u000a      replacement. Ownership costs are therefore very low. Several systems have\u000a      been in operation, in\u000a      situ, for more than two years with no maintenance and zero head\u000a      replacement. The above coupled\u000a      technical, safety, operational and cost benefits have driven global\u000a      interest.\u000a    3. Improvements to detection of methane, and human safety: In\u000a      addition to commercial and\u000a      economic benefits, impact accrues from the applications to human health\u000a      and safety assurance via\u000a      the widespread need for detection of hazardous gases. This is especially\u000a      important for methane in\u000a      mines, tunnels (e.g. subway tunnels), gas (methane) production, and\u000a      associated storage, piping\u000a      and transport infra-structure. In particular, the sensor is designed to\u000a      operate continuously following\u000a      emergency electrical shut-down to an incident zone, widening intervention\u000a      \/ rescue options. Hence,\u000a      the benefits to the wider global industries involved in these sectors and\u000a      to society in general are\u000a      substantial in reach. High profile purchasers of systems include Tokyo\u000a      Gas, Hong Kong and China\u000a      Gas Co., Chengdu Gas Co. (all for sub-city gas distribution tunnels \/\u000a      ducts), Hainan Minsheng Gas\u000a      Co. (for liquid natural gas storage sites), Tiandi Automation Co. Ltd.\u000a      (largest mine safety systems\u000a      integrator in China) and Alpha Natural Resources (third largest coal\u000a      mining company in the USA).\u000a      To put the significance of the new technology in context, in China alone\u000a      over 3000 lives are lost\u000a      annually to monthly occurring methane explosions in mines.\u000a    4. Wider applications: Strathclyde University, OptoSci Ltd and\u000a      Rolls-Royce are developing the\u000a      same techniques for process monitoring and emissions control in gas\u000a      turbine (aero) engines and\u000a      fuel cells. Impact will accrue from low carbon gains via more efficient\u000a      fuel cells and better fuels for\u000a      aero engines with concomitant reduction in emissions. This has led to a\u000a      new, high technology, gas\u000a      measurement product with first sales by July 2103 of &#163;25k to Rolls-Royce\u000a      Fuel Cell Systems Ltd.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    New commercial gas sensing technology developed from research at the\u000a      University of Strathclyde\u000a      brings extensive technical, operational, safety and cost benefits to\u000a      applications such as mine safety\u000a      and leak detection in methane production, storage, piping and transport\u000a      systems.

However, they suffer from the\u000a      requirement to have\u000a      electrical power at every sensor head, the need for regular re-calibration\u000a      and maintenance of the\u000a      sensors (monthly for some applications) and sensor head degradation\u000a      leading to a need for\u000a      frequent replacement (every 6-12 months depending on the application).\u000a      Following a gas\u000a      contamination or leak incident (usually methane), all electrical power is\u000a      shut off to the incident zone\u000a      (in mining that means the entire underground complex), leaving the\u000a      operators and rescue teams\u000a      blind to the gas conditions (particularly detrimental in mining).\u000a    Our research has led to the development and commercialisation of a\u000a      multi-point optical methane\u000a      detection system where electrical power is not required at the sensor\u000a      heads. In an emergency, the\u000a      system continues to inform the operators and rescue teams of the gas\u000a      conditions in the incident\u000a      zone. In addition, significant technical and operational benefits accrue\u000a      from the self-calibrating and\u000a      highly reliable sensor heads (long periods between maintenance and little\u000a      need for replacement).\u000a    Key Research Findings: The research, carried out entirely in the\u000a      department of Electronic and\u000a      Electrical Engineering (EEE) at the University of Strathclyde, which led\u000a      to the new commercial\u000a      product, centred on two distinct areas, conducted from 1995 to 1998 and\u000a      from 2002 to 2009:\u000a    1. From 1995 to 1998, research in the EEE Department at Strathclyde led\u000a      to the ground breaking\u000a      development and first ever demonstration of large scale, multi point,\u000a      optical gas detection systems\u000a      with no need of electrical power at the sensing points. Single point, free\u000a      space tuneable diode\u000a      laser spectroscopy (TDLS) for gas detection and concentration measurement\u000a      was available, but of\u000a      course required electrical power for the laser and receivers. Our research\u000a      extended this technology\u000a      to large scale multi-point systems based on optical sensing cells\u000a      addressed by single mode optical\u000a      fibres in a multi-branch or long distance linear network [References 1\u000a      &amp; 2]. With the development\u000a      and refinement of this new technology, up to 300 points can now be\u000a      addressed from a single laser\u000a      over a wide area involving distances up to 20km. The laser and optical\u000a      receivers are housed\u000a      together in a control room remote from the potential gas incident zone and\u000a      no electrical power is\u000a      required at the sensor heads, in the fibre optic network or indeed\u000a      anywhere in the potential incident\u000a      zone.\u000a    The insight and challenges in the research were related to the input \/\u000a      output optical fibre interfacing\u000a      to the sensing cells (detection zones), the multi-path optical\u000a      interference resulting from the\u000a      collimating and collection lenses, and the data acquisition and signal\u000a      processing systems to\u000a      address such large sensing point arrays in parallel and quickly. The fibre\u000a      interfacing was refined to\u000a      minimise optical loss through the cell and to minimise the optical\u000a      interference and the associated\u000a      noise arising at the receivers [References 3 &amp; 4]. The optical\u000a      interference noise and all other\u000a      sources of optical and electronic noise were fully characterised and\u000a      minimised to a tolerable level.\u000a      Optical power losses through the whole system were minimised through\u000a      modelling and\u000a      experimentation. These achievements along with the later development of\u000a      fast update, calibration-free\u000a      data acquisition and analysis systems (see research area 2) enabled the\u000a      system to achieve\u000a      the number of sensing points and area extent noted above. The initial work\u000a      on this and its ground\u000a      breaking outcomes (multi-point wide area coverage and no requirement of\u000a      electrical power at the\u000a      sensors) were achieved in 1995 to 1998 via a DTI Link project called OMEGA\u000a      [Grant A Section 3].\u000a    Key researchers: This research programme was carried out wholly\u000a      within the EEE Department at\u000a      Strathclyde and was led by Professor Brian Culshaw, PI on Project (member\u000a      of academic staff,\u000a      1984 to 2010) and Professor George Stewart, Co-I on Project (member of\u000a      academic staff 1986 to\u000a      2011).\u000a    2. From 2002 to 2009 our research led to the development, analysis and\u000a      experimental validation of\u000a      novel, calibration-free techniques in TDLS with wavelength modulation (WM)\u000a      that, for the first time,\u000a      allowed absolute gas absorption line-shapes to be recovered from\u000a      wavelength modulation\u000a      spectroscopy (WMS) measurements. This innovation resulted in\u000a      calibration-free, highly accurate,\u000a      simultaneous measurement of gas concentration and pressure using WMS\u000a      techniques. Full\u000a      mathematical models of the signal generation and recovery algorithms in\u000a      relation to the\u000a      spectroscopic line-shapes were developed and reported, along with full\u000a      experimental investigations\u000a      and validation of the models and techniques [References 5 &amp; 6].\u000a    Key researchers: This research work was led by Prof. Walter\u000a      Johnstone (member of academic\u000a      staff 1986 &#8212; present) and Prof. George Stewart (1986-2011), initially\u000a      through their supervision of\u000a      two EPSRC CASE PhD students: Kevin Duffin (sponsored by OptoSci Ltd. &#8212;\u000a      2002-05 and then\u000a      research assistant, 2006-09) and Andrew McGettrick (sponsor Rolls-Royce,\u000a      2004-7). It was refined\u000a      for engineering application under a DTI project involving OptoSci Ltd.\u000a      called \"Remote atmospheric\u000a      laser methane sensing (REALMS)\" [Grant B Section 3, 2006-09; PI: W\u000a      Johnstone].

Strathclyde has played a leading role in discovering\u000d\u000a      the capabilities and\u000d\u000a      advantages of UHF monitoring for power transformers and disseminated the\u000d\u000a      findings through\u000d\u000a      publications, contributions to international working groups and knowledge\u000d\u000a      exchange activities. In\u000d\u000a      April 2008 Judd was a member of a group of international transformer\u000d\u000a      experts producing a final\u000d\u000a      report for the International Council on Large Electric Systems (CIGRE), a\u000d\u000a      non-profit association for\u000d\u000a      promoting collaboration with experts from around the world. The report\u000d\u000a      (Technical Brochure 343)\u000d\u000a      recognised the role of UHF PD detection and location and recommended that\u000d\u000a      additional valves for\u000d\u000a      installing UHF sensors be specified on transformers that form important\u000d\u000a      links in the transmission\u000d\u000a      network.\u000d\u000a    Consultancy services were provided to DMS by Judd to evaluate UHF PD\u000d\u000a      location trials during\u000d\u000a      factory tests at ALSTOM (Stafford, 2008), Brush Transformers\u000d\u000a      (Loughborough, 2009), VonRoll (Tel\u000d\u000a      Aviv, 2010) and Sunbelt (Texas, 2013) and consultancy services were\u000d\u000a      provided by Judd at the\u000d\u000a      request of Singapore PowerGrid in 2010\/11 (Source C).\u000d\u000a    International sales and market penetration: Qualitrol-DMS is the\u000d\u000a      preferred supplier of PD\u000d\u000a      monitoring systems to major international manufacturers of gas insulated\u000d\u000a      substations including\u000d\u000a      Siemens, ABB, Areva and Hyundai. By 2012 sales had increased by 82% to\u000d\u000a      &#163;11.1M, compared\u000d\u000a      with &#163;6.1M at the end of 2007. More than 90% of sales value represents\u000d\u000a      exports from the UK. By\u000d\u000a      2012, the company had doubled its annual profits compared with pre-2008\u000d\u000a      figures and total\u000d\u000a      exports for 2008 - 2013 have exceeded &#163;45M (Source B). Further growth is\u000d\u000a      ensured through\u000d\u000a      expansion into the transformer monitoring market, fostered by\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde's pioneering research\u000d\u000a      activities in this field. Notable examples of penetration into the\u000d\u000a      transformer market include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      UHF sensors and monitoring system have been installed on gas-insulated\u000d\u000a        transformers at\u000d\u000a        Scottish Power's flagship Dewar Place substation in Edinburgh, which\u000d\u000a        supplies the capital's\u000d\u000a        financial district. The SF6-filled transformers and reactors\u000d\u000a        manufactured by Toshiba Corp are\u000d\u000a        the first of their kind to be installed in the northern hemisphere and\u000d\u000a        the first to be equipped with\u000d\u000a        UHF monitoring. Ten individual gas-insulated units are fitted with a\u000d\u000a        total of 36 UHF sensors to a\u000d\u000a        design based on the original capacitive sensors developed at\u000d\u000a        Strathclyde. All of these were\u000d\u000a        calibrated on Strathclyde's frequency response measurement system.\u000d\u000a      AEP (American Electric Power), the largest US Transmission company,\u000d\u000a        spread over 11 states,\u000d\u000a        operating 3500 substations and 5500 transformers, has adopted the UHF PD\u000d\u000a        monitoring\u000d\u000a        technique within its evolving smart grid strategy. Six transformers\u000d\u000a        manufactured in 2012 were\u000d\u000a        equipped with 4 UHF sensors each to enable continuous monitoring once in\u000d\u000a        service. These\u000d\u000a        units are the first of an initial batch of 42 large power transformers\u000d\u000a        with a `built-in' UHF\u000d\u000a        monitoring capability that AEP is deploying as part of its network\u000d\u000a        upgrade strategy.\u000d\u000a      SP Energy Networks (SPEN) policy document for Lifecycle Management of\u000d\u000a        Large Power\u000d\u000a        Transformers (rev. Feb. 2013) states that, \"All new large power\u000d\u000a          transformers will be fitted with\u000d\u000a          four additional 50DN ball valves fitted with blanking plates for the\u000d\u000a          possible installation of through\u000d\u000a          tank probes utilised in PD monitoring\" and goes on to define the\u000d\u000a        positioning of the probes based\u000d\u000a        on recommendations for sensor location deriving from Strathclyde\u000d\u000a        research (Source D and E).\u000d\u000a      SPEN has also deployed continuous UHF monitoring on 4 power\u000d\u000a        transformers at its Clyde\u000d\u000a        North wind farm substation. One of these units is also equipped with the\u000d\u000a        first on-line monitoring\u000d\u000a        system that allows PD location to be carried out using time-of-flight\u000d\u000a        measurements inside the\u000d\u000a        tank. This system was developed collaboratively between Strathclyde and\u000d\u000a        Qualitrol-DMS within\u000d\u000a        a KTP project, originally as a diagnostic tool used by an expert\u000d\u000a        on-site. This new\u000d\u000a        implementation provides a platform for complete automation of the\u000d\u000a        process.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Benefits to the consumer: UHF PD monitoring technology resulting\u000d\u000a      from Strathclyde research\u000d\u000a      and commercialised through DMS is providing diagnostic services for\u000d\u000a      electrical equipment in 27\u000d\u000a      countries that include Brazil, China, Russia, USA, Korea, Singapore,\u000d\u000a      Malaysia, India, Australia and\u000d\u000a      six Gulf states (Source F). In these nations, electrical utilities that\u000d\u000a      use the UHF technology benefit\u000d\u000a      financially by avoiding unplanned outages of these critical gas insulated\u000d\u000a      substations, which result\u000d\u000a      in emergency repair costs, damage to corporate reputation and can often\u000d\u000a      lead to regulatory\u000d\u000a      financial penalties for causing loss of supply to customers. Consumers\u000d\u000a      (both domestic and\u000d\u000a      commercial) who depend upon a continual source of electrical power also\u000d\u000a      benefit from improved\u000d\u000a      quality and reliability of supply. Power disruption has potentially severe\u000d\u000a      consequences for industrial\u000d\u000a      processes (e.g. semiconductor foundries) and society (e.g. hospitals,\u000d\u000a      computing installations). UHF\u000d\u000a      monitoring technology contributes to the maintenance of a continual\u000d\u000a      electricity supply by providing\u000d\u000a      early warning of developing insulation defects in HV equipment, allowing\u000d\u000a      maintenance to be\u000d\u000a      scheduled in a way that avoids supply disruption.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Innovative research at Strathclyde University, embodied in its spinout\u000d\u000a      Diagnostic Monitoring\u000d\u000a      Systems (DMS) Ltd, has enabled the Glasgow-based company to become the\u000d\u000a      premier supplier of\u000d\u000a      ultra-high frequency (UHF) systems for detecting harmful partial discharge\u000d\u000a      (PD) activity in high-value\u000d\u000a      gas insulated substations and power transformers.

These signals propagate for some tens of metres within the\u000d\u000a      coaxial busbars of\u000d\u000a      GIS, and Strathclyde research demonstrated that they provide a unique and\u000d\u000a      effective basis for on-line\u000d\u000a      monitoring of entire substations in order to prevent sudden, unexpected\u000d\u000a      outages of these\u000d\u000a      critical assets due to flashover of the gaseous SF6 insulation.\u000d\u000a      Benefits include improved reliability\u000d\u000a      and quality of supply together with the avoidance of repair costs and\u000d\u000a      financial penalties, which can\u000d\u000a      amount to &#163;500k\/day for outages of key substations.\u000d\u000a    Global exports of UHF monitoring systems for GIS have formed the core\u000d\u000a      business of Strathclyde's\u000d\u000a      spin-out DMS since its foundation and that market continues to expand.\u000d\u000a      Nevertheless, GIS are\u000d\u000a      relatively specialised, high-value installations. In contrast, power\u000d\u000a      transformers are used throughout\u000d\u000a      electricity transmission networks. Many of these transformers are\u000d\u000a      operating well beyond their\u000d\u000a      designed life expectancy, particularly in developed countries.

Working in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Scottish\u000d\u000a      Power and National Grid, Strathclyde staff (Farish, Hampton, and Pearson)\u000d\u000a      applied the UHF\u000d\u000a      technique in a world-first pilot installation of a continuous UHF\u000d\u000a      condition monitoring system [2] at\u000d\u000a      Torness Nuclear Power Station in East Lothian, which is linked to the grid\u000d\u000a      through a 400 kV GIS. A\u000d\u000a      further EPSRC grant (1996-1999) awarded to the same team led to the\u000d\u000a      invention of a calibration\u000d\u000a      system for UHF PD sensors. Reported in [3] (a paper that was awarded the\u000d\u000a      IEE Ayrton Premium),\u000d\u000a      this breakthrough gained further recognition through the award of First\u000d\u000a      Prize in the Frontier\u000d\u000a      Science category of the `Metrology for UK Manufacturing Awards' (1997).\u000d\u000a      The calibration technique\u000d\u000a      was adopted as the basis for the UHF coupler sensitivity specification\u000d\u000a      issued by National Grid\u000d\u000a      (Technical Guidance Note 121), which has become the de-facto international\u000d\u000a      standard for UHF\u000d\u000a      sensors, with more than 16,000 sensors installed around the world having\u000d\u000a      been designed or\u000d\u000a      calibrated to this specification.\u000d\u000a    The researcher (Judd) employed on the first two EPSRC projects\u000d\u000a      subsequently won a prestigious\u000d\u000a      5-year EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship (1999-2004), which focussed on\u000d\u000a      applying UHF\u000d\u000a      techniques to locate PD inside large power transformers and led to a\u000d\u000a      subsequent EPSRC\/industry\u000d\u000a      project (2004-2007), in which key discoveries were made concerning the\u000d\u000a      relationship between\u000d\u000a      UHF PD detection methods and the conventional IEC60270 standard, as\u000d\u000a      reported in [4]. Several\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Exchange projects with DMS on the transformer work flowed from\u000d\u000a      this activity, most\u000d\u000a      notably a KTP (2007-2009) that delivered an integrated system for UHF\u000d\u000a      detection, location and\u000d\u000a      visualisation in three dimensions of the position of insulation defects\u000d\u000a      inside large power\u000d\u000a      transformers. The accumulated research findings were recently consolidated\u000d\u000a      in a book chapter [5],\u000d\u000a      which includes case studies on UHF PD location applied both in the field\u000d\u000a      and at manufacturers' HV\u000d\u000a      test facilities.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers: All key researchers were employed in the\u000d\u000a      Department of Electronic and\u000d\u000a      Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde at the time of the\u000d\u000a      research.

As research results generated from 2005 until 2008 started to\u000d\u000a      look promising and the proposed Active Network Management technology\u000d\u000a      looked viable, discussion turned towards implementation in the Orkney\u000d\u000a      network as a technology trial. The main focus of the activity under the\u000d\u000a      two follow-on contracts (April 2006 - June 2008, [Refs 6-7] involved\u000d\u000a      knowledge exchange into SSEPD, into SSEPD's contractors for the trial\u000d\u000a      deployment, and into the patents drafted and submitted in 2008 [Refs 3 and\u000d\u000a      4]. On the basis of the research, SSEPD took the decision that a viable\u000d\u000a      alternative to network reinforcement (through an additional subsea cable\u000d\u000a      to connect Orkney to the mainland) was available, with considerable cost\u000d\u000a      savings as outlined below.\u000d\u000a    Types of Impact: The following impacts arose from the\u000d\u000a      collaborative programme of research.\u000d\u000a    Commercially successful spin out created: As SSEPD explored how to\u000d\u000a      support the deployment of ANM on Orkney and elsewhere, discussions around\u000d\u000a      commercial spin-out from the University of Strathclyde began and quickly\u000d\u000a      developed into a proposal approved by the university and external\u000d\u000a      investors (Scottish &amp; Southern Energy Venture Capital and the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Co-Investment Fund managed by the regional development agency Scottish\u000d\u000a      Enterprise). Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd was incorporated in June 2008 and\u000d\u000a      spun out from the university on an arm's length basis in September 2008.\u000d\u000a      The spin-out process enabled a focus on industry needs to deliver ANM\u000d\u000a      technology on a fully supported commercial basis. Smarter Grid Solutions\u000d\u000a      Ltd. has grown substantially since formation in 2008 with total revenues\u000d\u000a      to the end of March 2013 standing at &#163;6.1M from projects with UK and\u000d\u000a      European power network operators.

[Source A supports all claims related to Smarter\u000d\u000a      Grid Solutions.]\u000d\u000a    New technology adopted: From 2009, SSEPD started connecting\u000d\u000a      additional wind generation to the Orkney power system under the ANM\u000d\u000a      scheme. Until that point the network had effectively been closed to new\u000d\u000a      generation connections due to network thermal capacity constraints and\u000d\u000a      this has been resolved through application of the ANM solution delivered\u000d\u000a      by Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd.\u000d\u000a    Cost savings to Scottish and Southern Energy: The deployment of\u000d\u000a      ANM technology on the Orkney power network in 2009 has resulted in power\u000d\u000a      network reinforcement deferral savings of &#163;30M from an avoided additional\u000d\u000a      sub-sea power cable from mainland Scotland to Orkney [Source B].\u000d\u000a    Costs and customer benefits: As highlighted within the UK Power\u000d\u000a      Networks Business Plan [Source F], significant savings have been produced\u000d\u000a      following a trial of the Flexible Plug and Play Network (FPP) which\u000d\u000a      utilised the ANM method resulting in an average saving of 87% covering six\u000d\u000a      wind farms. Economies of scale have reduced the costs of the ANM system\u000d\u000a      and telecommunications platform for the FPP project to about &#163;2 million.\u000d\u000a    Power generation: The deployment of ANM technology on the Orkney\u000d\u000a      power system has led to the connection of 18 additional wind farm\u000d\u000a      developments with 25.91MW aggregate capacity on the Orkney power network\u000d\u000a      between 2009 and 2013. There are carbon reduction and local, social and\u000d\u000a      economic benefits from the development of these additional renewable\u000d\u000a      generation schemes, and wind farms connected to Orkney gained earlier and\u000d\u000a      cheaper access to the power system through the deployment of ANM\u000d\u000a      technology [Source C].\u000d\u000a    Changes to investment strategy of UK network operators: The\u000d\u000a      research and subsequent commercial deployment of ANM technology has\u000d\u000a      provided new power system investment options for the UK distribution\u000d\u000a      network operators and these have fed through into their 8-year investment\u000d\u000a      plans being published in 2013 [Source E and F]. Smarter Grid Solutions\u000d\u000a      Ltd. has been at the forefront of advising UK power companies on ANM\u000d\u000a      technology and this impact on design and investment policy is a direct\u000d\u000a      result of the research. In the UK, the impact of successful deployment of\u000d\u000a      ANM technology on Orkney has given confidence to power companies to invest\u000d\u000a      in further deployments of this technology under innovation funding (i.e.\u000d\u000a      Low Carbon Network Fund) and to include ANM technology in their investment\u000d\u000a      plans for the period 2015-2023 under the RIIO price control mechanism\u000d\u000a      [Source D]. The ANM technology (being promoted by Smarter Grid Solutions\u000d\u000a      Ltd.) has been the focus of industry wide assessment in the Ofgem\/DECC\u000d\u000a      Smart Grid Forum Workstream 3 modelling activities in 2012\/13, and has\u000d\u000a      been the focus of business planning activities with all 6 of the UK\u000d\u000a      Distribution Network Operator companies (i.e. Scottish &amp; Southern\u000d\u000a      Energy Power Distribution, Scottish Power Energy Networks, Western Power\u000d\u000a      Distribution, UK Power Networks, Northern Power Grid, and Electricity\u000d\u000a      North West).\u000d\u000a    Wider adoption: By July 2013, Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd. was in\u000d\u000a      advanced stages of discussion relating to feasibility assessment and\u000d\u000a      deployment with clients in the EU, US and Asia Pacific.

Ault worked in close collaboration with SSEPD and this\u000d\u000a      became a vital part of the subsequent deployment of a solution and the\u000d\u000a      generation of the impacts described in this case study.\u000d\u000a    Two further sequential projects from 2006 to 2008 [Grants 6 and 7]\u000d\u000a      refined the methods for design of the active power flow management scheme\u000d\u000a      in terms of control zone definitions (based on identification through\u000d\u000a      analysis of critical power network constraint locations) and trigger\u000d\u000a      threshold calculations (based on assumed ramp rates for energy generation\u000d\u000a      and demand, and communication and control time delays).\u000d\u000a    Key Findings: The initial research resulted in the core concept\u000d\u000a      for Active Network Management (ANM) with the Orkney power network. The\u000d\u000a      core research contributed an ANM requirements specification (including\u000d\u000a      functional and non-functional elements), algorithms for control (including\u000d\u000a      identification and resolution of multiple power circuit constraints) and a\u000d\u000a      conceptual design (including measurement, communications, control hardware\u000d\u000a      and software) for a deployable ANM system. The project was a significant\u000d\u000a      step towards a deployable ANM solution based on underpinning power system\u000d\u000a      and control research. The research also provided the necessary technical\u000d\u000a      detail to allow discussion of the implementation of ANM concepts within\u000d\u000a      the industry.\u000d\u000a    Ault and Currie worked with SSEPD personnel to establish the conceptual\u000d\u000a      design for an active power flow management approach based on measurement\u000d\u000a      of circuit power flows and the regulation of wind farm power output to\u000d\u000a      relieve network constraints. This was based on methods to calculate the\u000d\u000a      wind generation constraints and economic feasibility of wind power in such\u000d\u000a      an ANM scheme [1]. The wind generation constraint assessment (later\u000d\u000a      generalised to any type of generation or electricity demand) enables a\u000d\u000a      time series of electrical demand and generation (in half-hourly or higher\u000d\u000a      resolution) to be assessed over a significant timescale (e.g. years) to\u000d\u000a      quantify the number of constraint periods and the total constraint energy\u000d\u000a      volume for one or more generators. The economic impact of loss of\u000d\u000a      generation revenue from energy sales and any renewable certificates or\u000d\u000a      incentives can then be calculated.\u000d\u000a    A further core research challenge tackled was a method for calculation of\u000d\u000a      appropriate operating margins for an ANM scheme. This is important as\u000d\u000a      operating margins that are too narrow present power network security\u000d\u000a      risks, whilst margins that are too conservative and wide limit access to\u000d\u000a      the available network capacity for power generators. The research\u000d\u000a      presented a method of calculating multiple operating margins that could be\u000d\u000a      applied within an ANM scheme [2].\u000d\u000a    The practical implementation of an ANM scheme requires that a power\u000d\u000a      network is organised into different zones of control. The research\u000d\u000a      established the method for identifying these zones of control, with\u000d\u000a      reference to the identification of all possible network constraint\u000d\u000a      locations. This approach was embodied in a patent [3].\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers at Strathclyde: Graham Ault led the research\u000d\u000a      throughout. He was a Research Fellow in 2003, and progressed to Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer (2005), Reader (2008) and Professor (2010) in the Department of\u000d\u000a      Electronic and Electrical Engineering. Robert Currie was Ault's PhD\u000d\u000a      student at the start of the research in 2003, became Research Assistant at\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde (2006) before leaving the University to join Smarter Grid\u000d\u000a      Solutions Ltd (2008) where he is still the Technical Director.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42338","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Process from research to impact: The Strathclyde team maximised\u000a      the economic impact resulting from its research through a series of\u000a      coordinated steps:\u000a    \u000a      Instigating and then collaborating on the development and\u000a          commercialisation of new diamond product lines, by iterative\u000a          diagnostic assessment and proving the material in key applications.\u000a      Pioneering a diamond-enabled laser technology that was subsequently\u000a          commercialised.\u000a      Developing a diamond etch process [text removed for publication].\u000a      Identifying and developing the novel laser architectures needed to\u000a          enable new markets for diamond in photonics, for example as\u000a          heatspreaders in semiconductor disk lasers.\u000a    \u000a    This impact was developed in partnership with Element Six Ltd,\u000a      drawing on their world-leading diamond growth capability.

This requires a step change in thermal\u000a      engineering to manage greater heat deposition in the laser material when\u000a      operated at higher powers. To achieve this, Strathclyde has pioneered the\u000a      use of high optical quality synthetic diamond, which has a thermal\u000a      conductivity almost 100 times that of current optical materials. This\u000a      required improvements in the optical quality of synthetic diamond and the\u000a      development of laser architectures that enable diamond to efficiently\u000a      extract heat from a conventional laser material or to be used as a laser\u000a      material in its own right.\u000a    Key Findings:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aIdentifying and Proving Key Opportunities (2003-present): The\u000a        Strathclyde team was the first to demonstrate (2004 [1]) and then fully\u000a        analyse (2005 [2]) the use of diamond as a heat spreader within the\u000a        cavity of a semiconductor disk laser. This reduced the temperature rise\u000a        within the laser material and enabled the team to demonstrate watt-level\u000a        output powers at 0.67&#181;m (2005), 1.05&#181;m (2006), 1.32&#181;m (2004), 2.0&#181;m\u000a        (2009) and 2.35&#181;m (2007). Prior to this, semiconductor disk lasers with\u000a        output powers in excess of a few hundred milliwatts had only been\u000a        demonstrated between 0.9 and 1.103bcm. This work was undertaken with a\u000a        range of partners, both industrial (e.g. Samsung, Osram,\u000a        FujiFilm) and academic (e.g. Fraunhofer IAF, Tampere,\u000a        Sheffield, whose expertise was in III-V semiconductor growth, not\u000a        diamond and its use), helping seed the growth of a world-wide\u000a        semiconductor disk laser community. The Strathclyde team demonstrated\u000a        that these lasers are ideal for nonlinear frequency conversion to\u000a        address an even wider range of wavelengths and hence applications,\u000a        demonstrating an ultra-violet system (2006) [3] and their first use to\u000a        pump optical parametric oscillators (2009) and Raman lasers (2011). The\u000a        team's Raman lasers were the first demonstrations of diamond as a laser\u000a        material in its own right in a continuously operating laser - a route by\u000a        which diamond's exceptional thermal properties can be more fully\u000a        exploited to improve the output power of lasers in the future [6].\u000a      \u000aDeveloping and Proving Enabling Material (2006-present): The\u000a        Strathclyde team identified deficiencies that severely limited the\u000a        market potential of existing diamond: birefringence (2006) and loss\u000a        (2011).

This system\u000a      was the world's first ever wideband sonar capable of performing location,\u000a      identification and classification from a single system. Each sonar array\u000a      comprises many, sometimes thousands, of individual transducer elements,\u000a      arranged so that the sound beam can be moved around under control of the\u000a      electronics in the sonar unit. Moving the sonar beam this way enables\u000a      images of the underwater scene to be developed in real time.

During 2005 - 2008, the research\u000a      conducted by Hayward and CUE produced ground-breaking innovations in the\u000a      company's product range which helped to realise a range of\u000a      sensitivity-bandwidth properties which were previously unachievable.\u000a    Types of Impact\u000a    Expansion of Alba Ultrasound Ltd: Since 2008, Alba has undergone a\u000a      significant expansion in business, primarily associated with\u000a      diversification into commercial sonar markets, including underwater\u000a      surveying, sea bed mapping, intruder detection systems and guidance of\u000a      underwater vehicles. [text removed for publication]\u000a    In 2009, the company moved into new state-of-the-art customised premises\u000a      in the North of Glasgow, which provided the environment to enable a step\u000a      change in the production output. Subsequently, turnover has increased\u000a      almost linearly from &#163;0.75M in 2007 to &#163;3.8M by the end of June 2013 and\u000a      the business is growing rapidly, with an employee count of 45 in June 2013 - an increase of 200% from the start of 2008. The collaboration with the\u000a      Centre for Ultrasonic Engineering has provided a conduit for 4 highly\u000a      skilled researchers into Alba in both project management and senior\u000a      engineer roles.\u000a    Sales and exports: Alba's key differentiator in the transducer\u000a      manufacturing sector is the design of bespoke array transducers to match\u000a      the wide range of applications associated with their worldwide customer\u000a      base. Approximately 70% of Alba's products were exported in 2012. By July\u000a      2013 in the region of 15% of the company's sales were in the\u000a      military\/naval sector, and the remaining 85% of sales to other commercial\u000a      sonar manufacturing companies.

Alba incorporated the outcomes of fundamental research\u000a      undertaken at Strathclyde into their design process leading to products\u000a      that are able to operate efficiently across extended bandwidths from a\u000a      single device. This has revolutionised the mode of operation for sonar\u000a      systems, as not only can a single device be driven at high power for\u000a      enhanced propagation distances, but the ability to control the drive\u000a      frequency provides the capability of switching from object detection (use\u000a      of low frequencies, with low resolution) to object classification (using\u000a      the higher resolution afforded by the smaller wavelengths associated with\u000a      high frequency wave propagation). The application of advanced coded\u000a      excitation waveforms within these sonar systems was a consequence of the\u000a      uniform transducer behaviour achieved over extended bandwidths which, in\u000a      turn, permitted the implementation of advanced signal and image processing\u000a      techniques. The company received the Queen's Award for Innovation in 2012\u000a      (Source D).\u000a    Alba Ultrasound manufactures high end, bespoke transducer array products\u000a      for the following applications; side scan and bathymetric sonar, mine\u000a      hunting, high frequency imaging, intruder detection, autonomous underwater\u000a      vehicles, remotely operated vehicles and hull mounted sonar systems\u000a      (Source E). The clients who purchase Alba's arrays are companies who in\u000a      turn manufacture the electronics and display systems for the complete\u000a      sonar product, which is then sold on to the end-users. Each Alba 'product'\u000a      is tailored to the requirements of an individual client and its particular\u000a      sonar system.\u000a    Contribution to the commercial success of other companies: The\u000a      research conducted in collaboration with the University of Strathclyde\u000a      during 2008-13 has directly led to a range of Alba products which have had\u000a      a beneficial effect on the global sonar market.

The research was supported by a range of\u000a      funded programmes, including EPSRC grants and research contracts from the\u000a      US Office of Naval Research and the UK Ministry of Defence. In 2000,\u000a      Hayward formed a start-up company Alba Ultrasound, while continuing as a\u000a      full-time academic in the EEE Department. Hayward's research from 2000\u000a      focussed on demonstrating the transducer technology in underwater\u000a      applications such as sonar systems in submarines and other vessels, where\u000a      reliability in harsh marine environments, wideband operation, high power\u000a      handling and cost-effectiveness are essential requirements.\u000a    Key Findings: A series of key research findings have informed the\u000a      transducer design process at Alba Ultrasound. The breakthrough technology\u000a      behind Alba's transducer arrays utilises a two-phase piezoelectric\u000a      material, comprising a matrix of active piezoelectric ceramic pillars,\u000a      embedded within a passive polymer phase [1] in a 1-3 composite structure.\u000a      This structure has to then be encapsulated within a bespoke housing,\u000a      incorporating additional backing and matching layers in order to optimize\u000a      the transducer array's performance for a specific application. A detailed\u000a      understanding of the multitude of resonance mechanisms associated with\u000a      such a complex structure is critical in the design of truly wideband\u000a      transducer arrays. In-depth knowledge of the interaction between the\u000a      active and passive phases in 1-3 connectivity piezoelectric ceramic\u000a      composite configurations ensures that no parasitic resonant modes appear\u000a      in the desired operational frequency bandwidth of an array. Fundamental\u000a      research undertaken during the period 1993-1999 provided significant\u000a      advancement in the understanding of these complex interactions inherent in\u000a      the composite transducer microstructure and included: design guidelines\u000a      for the polymer passive phase in the 1-3 composite microstructure [1];\u000a      consideration of the complex interaction between the active and passive\u000a      phases to maximise transducer efficiency [2]; and development of new\u000a      polymer materials to minimise mechanical cross-talk in ultrasonic array\u000a      devices, which is a source of image degradation in sonar systems [3].\u000a      Additional insight into the thermal behaviour of 1-3 composite transducers\u000a      proposed the use of loaded polymers to extend the maximum operating\u000a      temperature, which is important in high power sonar applications [4].\u000a      Moreover, when configured as an array transducer, these composite\u000a      microstructures have a double periodicity through the composite matrix\u000a      substrate and the array element configuration, further complicating the\u000a      design process. Reference 5 is a two part paper that introduced a new\u000a      understanding of the parasitic resonance modes in these structures and\u000a      offered the potential to design truly wideband sonar arrays [5]. During\u000a      this period, Alba and CUE collaborated on a KTP project which investigated\u000a      the use of new, single-crystal piezoelectric materials in composite\u000a      transducer designs, yielding enhancements in both sensitivity and\u000a      bandwidth over composite devices incorporating conventional piezoceramic\u000a      materials [6]. Thus the research, which has concentrated on understanding\u000a      the fundamental resonance mechanisms between the two constituent materials\u000a      within the composite matrix substrate with control of the polymer phase\u000a      [1,3,4] and the ceramic dimensions [2,5,6], is at the heart of Alba's\u000a      efficient unimodal piezocomposite transducer designs. A key element in\u000a      extending this piezoelectric technology into array structures was provided\u000a      by the seminal work regarding the presence of Lamb waves due to\u000a      periodicity in both the matrix substrate and array layout [5].\u000a    Key Researchers: Gordon Hayward, Professor in Department of\u000a      Electronic and Electrical Engineering University of Strathclyde, at time\u000a      of research from 1994 - 2006.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42340","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Process from research to impact:\u000d\u000a      The ITI Techmedia funded Condition Based Monitoring programme (CBM) was a\u000d\u000a      collaboration between the University of Strathclyde, the Royal Dick Vet\u000d\u000a      School (RDVS), Scottish Agriculture College (SAC), The Technology\u000d\u000a      Partnership (TTP) and Plexus.

Silent Herdsman&#174;, processes data on the collar and sends\u000d\u000a      alerts which are retained on the collar until acknowledged by the decision\u000d\u000a      support interface, resulting in a profound reduction of the volume of data\u000d\u000a      required to be downloaded to the application and a more robust\u000d\u000a      implementation.\u000d\u000a    Economic benefits to farmers:\u000d\u000a      Most profit in dairy farming goes to the supermarkets, leaving farmers to\u000d\u000a      balance rising feed, labour and infrastructure costs. In the UK alone, an\u000d\u000a      average of two farms per day abandon dairy farming and those that remain\u000d\u000a      operate increasingly larger herds to maximise profit through scale. An\u000d\u000a      important factor in increasing milk yields is oestrus detection, which\u000d\u000a      identifies the most appropriate time for insemination in the reproductive\u000d\u000a      process, leading to calving and in turn higher milk yields. Dairy farmers\u000d\u000a      worldwide consider oestrus detection to be the most labour intensive and\u000d\u000a      skilled task their staff have to perform. It is estimated that $2 Billion\u000d\u000a      a year is lost in global milk supply revenue due to missed heat detection.\u000d\u000a      From 2010, the Silent Herdsman&#174; system has been installed in over 250\u000d\u000a      farms in the UK and Europe.\u000d\u000a    The cost benefit to the farmer using the Silent Herdsman collar in a\u000d\u000a      dairy herd is estimated at approximately &#163;10k per 100 cows per annum\u000d\u000a      (Source D) achieved through a combination of increased milk revenue (&#163;5\u000d\u000a      per day for 21 days), feed costs (non-producing cows still require feed)\u000d\u000a      reduced insemination cost (&#163;25 unit cost) and reduced vet costs (fewer\u000d\u000a      examinations). Farms of 100 or more cows have already demonstrated an\u000d\u000a      increased milk yield of more than 10,000 litres per annum. The largest\u000d\u000a      farm deploying the system has 1100 cows. A farmer from Leicestershire\u000d\u000a      (Source E) states that `With Silent Herdsman I often find positive\u000d\u000a        heat detection results in certain animals I would have missed when\u000d\u000a        solely relying on observation. Now we can pin point the exact time for\u000d\u000a        insemination with Silent Herdsman&#174; allowing a cost effective solution\u000d\u000a        overall.' Another farmer from Northern Ireland states that \"With\u000d\u000a        a large herd like mine I cannot afford the time to be standing over\u000d\u000a        every single animal to observe heat detection. I was looking for an easy\u000d\u000a        to use solution that could take care of this farm management issue for\u000d\u000a        me.... Silent Herdsman is the solution.\"\u000d\u000a    While the immediate application of Silent Herdsman&#174; is to detect oestrus,\u000d\u000a      other aspects of animal health are indicated by activity measures from the\u000d\u000a      collar. The system is also able to predict the onset of illness which\u000d\u000a      could potentially be core to stopping the damaging spread of diseases such\u000d\u000a      as BSE which cost the industry ~&#163;7B on the last occasion it occurred.\u000d\u000a      General improved detection of other health problems will also deliver\u000d\u000a      higher quality milk and reduce costs.\u000d\u000a    Improving performance of existing businesses:\u000d\u000a      The Silent Herdsman&#174; is manufactured locally within Scotland at Dynamic\u000d\u000a      EMS (Source F), using a component supply chain also based in Scotland. NMR\u000d\u000a      plc supplies dairy management services, including the market leading\u000d\u000a      software system InterHerd, to around 50% of dairy producers in Britain and\u000d\u000a      the majority of leading dairy vets and consultants. The Managing Director\u000d\u000a      has noted that \"Silent Herdsman brings enviable accuracy levels and\u000d\u000a        significant advances to fertility monitoring on our dairy farms...\u000d\u000a        Movement technology has advanced considerably and, at the same time,\u000d\u000a        heat detection is becoming far more challenging.

Animal\u000d\u000a      husbandry involves monitoring animal health, wellbeing and productivity\u000d\u000a      and then responding in an appropriate way to optimise all three. This\u000d\u000a      management is still largely executed by humans using skills that have not\u000d\u000a      changed significantly in many years, but this approach is increasingly\u000d\u000a      difficult to sustain as farms increase in size. To operate more\u000d\u000a      cost-efficiently, farmers are looking to technology to deliver results.\u000d\u000a      Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a key enabling technology in this\u000d\u000a      regard. PLF requires that key information relating to the welfare\u000d\u000a      condition of livestock is communicated to a decision support platform that\u000d\u000a      assists farmers in the execution of their daily operation. The decision\u000d\u000a      support platform relies not only on obtaining valuable data, but also on\u000d\u000a      effective tools and algorithms to process and represent this data\u000d\u000a      meaningfully.

The algorithms carry out many\u000a      complex signal-processing tasks, tomography and data assimilation and\u000a      connect into an analysis of space weather that has proven to be both\u000a      accurate and reliable.\u000a    Space weather occurs when solar flares and the solar wind interact with\u000a      and perturb the near-Earth space environment. Through changes in the\u000a      Earth's ionosphere (the ionised upper atmosphere), space weather can\u000a      affect the performance of many communication and navigation systems. One\u000a      important effect is the performance degradation of Global Satellite\u000a      Navigation Systems (including GPS), reducing their accuracy in positioning\u000a      and limiting their system availability. The ionosphere remains the largest\u000a      source of error in single-frequency GPS navigation.\u000a    In the space-weather application of MIDAS, differential line-integral\u000a      observations of the Total Electron Content (TEC) obtained from a network\u000a      of ground-based and space-based GPS receivers are assimilated with other\u000a      space-weather data and analysed. The resulting reconstructions provide a\u000a      highly-accurate three-dimensional image of the Earth's ionosphere and its\u000a      changes over time [1-2]. MIDAS works in real time, so it can continuously\u000a      monitor and determine the changing nature of the ionosphere as it responds\u000a      to space weather. Importantly, it then uses this information to calculate,\u000a      again in real time, the exact effect of space weather on the position\u000a      errors in GPS measurements [3-4]. The MIDAS algorithms can be used to warn\u000a      of, or to remove, the delay error &#8212; and thus improve the accuracy of GPS.\u000a      They also reveal and quantify the signal distortions known as\u000a      scintillations that limit the availability of GPS (i.e., the loss of the\u000a      system at user level). MIDAS is used under licence from Bath by many other\u000a      academic institutions across the world [text removed for publication].\u000a    A further aspect of our MIDAS research is that huge quantities of data,\u000a      collected from the polar and equatorial regions, have been used to\u000a      quantify the effects of extreme space weather [5-6]. In several Bath-led\u000a      international collaborations there has been considerable effort made to\u000a      build, deploy and run reliable equipment at remote sites such as northern\u000a      Scandinavia and Antarctica [5-6]. These successful experiments have\u000a      yielded unique datasets that characterise ionospheric effects and are now\u000a      being used in a [text removed for publication] GPS simulator.

Ofgem consequently in 2008 required all\u000d\u000a      DNOs in the UK to adopt LRIC and, in reaching this decision, sought views\u000d\u000a      from all stakeholders. For example, Northern Powergrid (formerly CE\u000d\u000a      Electric) strongly supported the move, stating that LRIC, \"is the best\u000d\u000a        methodology to adopt as it most closely aligns to, and provides a\u000d\u000a        programmatic balance of, the principles that have been developed\",\u000d\u000a      and, further, that it \"provides the purest economic signals\", [a].\u000d\u000a      In summary, policy debate has been stimulated and policy\u000d\u000a        decisions have been informed by research evidence.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Industrial Practice &amp; Standards: Bath's local DNO,\u000d\u000a      Western Power Distribution, implemented the LRIC methodology for their\u000d\u000a      extra high voltage (EHV) distribution system in April 2007. Following\u000d\u000a      Ofgem's 2008 decision for its adoption as a licence obligation, LRIC was\u000d\u000a      subsequently developed into a common methodology by the industry and in\u000d\u000a      April 2011 it was adopted by the three remaining DNOs for their EHV\u000d\u000a      systems in England and Wales. All four DNOs have confirmed this adoption,\u000d\u000a      a typical statement being \"UK Power Networks have implemented the\u000d\u000a        version of the EHV Distribution Charging Methodology (EDCM) which\u000d\u000a        utilises the LRIC pricing approach as originally developed for Ofgem by\u000d\u000a        Bath University. The EDCM is used for the calculation of charges in all\u000d\u000a        three of our licenced areas including the East England, South East\u000d\u000a        England and London.\" [b]. In summary, through LRIC, industry's professional\u000a        standards, have been informed, improved processes have been adopted and,\u000d\u000a        professionals have used research findings in the conduct of their work.\u000d\u000a      In addition, Bath has provided technical support to industry's adoption of\u000d\u000a      LRIC through consultancies [c], thus the efficiency of providing a\u000d\u000a        professional service has been improved. Over time, the adoption of\u000d\u000a      LRIC will reduce the investment required to accommodate the anticipated\u000d\u000a      dramatic expansion of low-carbon technologies [d] and thus lower the cost\u000d\u000a      of low-carbon transition. Bath's research thus allows DNOs to take the\u000d\u000a      lead in combatting climate change and helps the UK meet its CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions targets.\u000d\u000a    The Development of Policies and Services of Benefit to the Developing\u000d\u000a        World: The development and implementation of Bath's LRIC methodology\u000d\u000a      for distribution networks has stimulated debate and resulted in benefits\u000d\u000a        for countries in the developing world &#8212; and in particular Brazil,\u000d\u000a      India and China. The Brazilian distribution charging structure reform was\u000d\u000a      influenced by Bath's research through Prof Li's participation in the\u000d\u000a      International Seminar on Electricity Tariff Structure organised by the\u000d\u000a      Brazilian energy regulator, ANEEL, in 2009 [e], through in-depth\u000d\u000a      discussion with their tariff design team [f] and through collaboration\u000d\u000a      with their lead scientist for network charges [g]. This subsequently led\u000d\u000a      to the establishment of the IEEE Power and Energy Society International\u000d\u000a      Working Group (IWG) on Network Charging chaired by Li (Bath) [h]. Through\u000d\u000a      this IWG, LRIC has received significant interest from Brazil, Germany,\u000d\u000a      Demark and India, which has, in turn, had a major impact on the research\u000d\u000a      work's focus and direction at Bath and stimulated further research.\u000d\u000a    The impact on India has been through a UK\/Indian Scientific Seminar held\u000d\u000a      in Jaipur, February 2013. Bath led the UK delegation and used the\u000d\u000a      opportunity to explore with leading Indian power industries and academics\u000d\u000a      new tariff structures that are both economically efficient and socially\u000d\u000a      acceptable [i]. This event was co-sponsored by the Departments of Business\u000d\u000a      Innovation and Skills (UK) and Science and Technology (India). It has led\u000d\u000a      to a &#163;2 million UK\/Indian consortium project led by Bath and IIT Roorkee\u000d\u000a      in Smart Grid with Energy Storage (EPSRC\/DST-HEAPD). In April 2013, Bath\u000d\u000a      was invited by the China National Development and Reform Commission\u000d\u000a      (Beijing) to disseminate the UK's network charging structure and presented\u000d\u000a      a report documenting its evolution as part of China's international review\u000d\u000a      to support its electricity market reform.\u000d\u000a    Many of Bath's PhDs and PDRAs have gone on to take roles in network\u000d\u000a      planning and pricing in the UK and internationally, including Scottish\u000d\u000a      &amp; Southern Energy, UK (H Heng and B Kuri) and The State Grid\u000d\u000a      Corporation, China (J Wang, B Li, Y Zhang). Through this pathway, highly\u000d\u000a        skilled people have taken up specialist roles that draw on their\u000d\u000a        research.\u000d\u000a    In summary, this research has had a major impact on government policy,\u000d\u000a      which has fed through industrial practice and standards to result in\u000d\u000a      societal, economic and environmental benefits.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at Bath has developed a new network charging methodology, known\u000d\u000a      as \"Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC) pricing for electricity\u000d\u000a        distribution systems\". The methodology enables the calculation of\u000d\u000a      location-specific annual network charges for electricity generators and\u000d\u000a      suppliers. It has replaced the flat-rate charging approach used by the\u000d\u000a      industry for the previous 25 years. Bath's work on LRIC has led to: 1) major\u000d\u000a        impact on government policy, because in 2008 the UK regulator Ofgem\u000d\u000a      required Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) to adopt LRIC as an\u000d\u000a      industry standard, using the evidence provided by Bath that LRIC's uptake\u000d\u000a      can lead to efficiency savings over the next 20 years of about &#163;200\u000d\u000a      million for DNOs, and 2) major impact on industrial practice,\u000d\u000a      because the subsequent industrial adoption of LRIC over 80% of the UK\u000d\u000a      distribution area has enabled the DNOs to promote efficient use of the\u000d\u000a      existing infrastructure. Further, LRIC's adoption in the UK has triggered\u000d\u000a      a wide review of transmission and distribution pricing in countries\u000d\u000a      including Brazil, Ireland, India and China. It also led to the\u000d\u000a      establishment of the IEEE International Working Group on Network Charging,\u000d\u000a      chaired by Li (Bath). Many of LRIC's key researchers at Bath have\u000d\u000a      subsequently taken key roles in network planning and pricing in UK and\u000d\u000a      international industry.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Bath\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bath (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bath","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007850}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269515","Name":"Jaipur"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1) *F Li and D Tolley, \"Long-run incremental cost &#8212; pricing based on\u000d\u000a      unused capacity\", IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 22, no. 4, pp.\u000d\u000a      1683 - 1689, 2007.

Achieving this will require that a\u000d\u000a      significant amount of renewables be connected to the electricity\u000d\u000a      distribution system, resulting in additional and substantial network\u000d\u000a      investment &#8212; unless those locations can be identified where renewable\u000d\u000a        generators can be connected at the least cost. The Distribution\u000d\u000a      Network Operator companies (DNOs) are responsible for distributing\u000d\u000a      electricity from generators to residential and commercial properties, but\u000d\u000a      have no control over the location and size of prospective generators,\u000d\u000a      except through the use of network charges. Prior to 2008, the UK's\u000d\u000a      six DNOs employed flat-rate network charging schemes that effectively\u000d\u000a      ignored both the location where electricity was generated and how\u000d\u000a      it was distributed to the customer. Generation companies thus had no\u000d\u000a      incentive to locate their generators closer to load centres to minimise\u000d\u000a      network costs. However, electricity distribution costs are very\u000d\u000a      significant and account for ~ 21% of UK electricity bills, with some &#163;6\u000d\u000a      billion of network investment needed from 2010 to 2015. Industry regulator\u000d\u000a      Ofgem recognised that flat-rate charging poses a major barrier to the\u000d\u000a      cost-effective integration of renewables, so in 2005 it published a\u000d\u000a      consultation document calling for a structural change to the charging\u000d\u000a      regime (https:\/\/www.ofgem.gov.uk\/ofgem-publications\/44442\/10763-13505.pdf).\u000d\u000a    In response to this call, Bath collaborated with Ofgem and Western Power\u000d\u000a      Distribution to develop the LRIC economic charging methodology that\u000d\u000a      enables DNOs to provide, for the first time, financial incentives to guide\u000d\u000a      generators to connect at low-cost locations. Bath's LRIC defines the\u000d\u000a      relationship between a location in an existing network and\u000d\u000a      the cost of integrating renewable generation at that\u000d\u000a      location [1, 2]. Bath's LRIC can handle practical distribution systems of\u000d\u000a      more than 2,000 connection points and produce long-run predictions of\u000d\u000a      investment cost in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. It is\u000d\u000a      thus a sophisticated yet practical mechanism for evaluating these\u000d\u000a      long-term network costs. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on\u000d\u000a      detailed and extensive system simulation for evaluating future network\u000d\u000a      costs, Bath's LRIC employs a bespoke set of analytical equations that\u000d\u000a      implicitly integrate the utilisation of all network components and the\u000d\u000a      distances from the generators to consumers. Critically, this\u000d\u000a          directly links the impact of an individual generator\u000d\u000a          connection to future investment costs [1, 2]. The use of LRIC\u000d\u000a      thus makes it possible for DNOs to assess the impact on future investment\u000d\u000a      costs of connecting generation at each network location. This enables DNOs\u000d\u000a      to set cost-reflective and justifiable network charges, thus providing\u000d\u000a      economic incentives to guide generators to the locations in the system\u000d\u000a      offering the greatest long-term benefits [3].\u000d\u000a    The LRIC methodology was initially developed through direct industrial\u000d\u000a      funding from Bath's local DNO, Western Power Distribution, and the\u000d\u000a      industry regulator, Ofgem.

In\u000a      2009 Newark airport in the US found some of its GPS related systems (in\u000a      particular, Ground Based Augmentation Systems) were suffering from\u000a      repeated interference. The problem was eventually traced back to a truck\u000a      driver using a GPS jammer, but due to a lack of suitable detecting\u000a      equipment this took six months to track down. Examples of the types of\u000a      systems affected by GPS jamming include aviation, shipping, transportation\u000a      of high-value or hazardous goods, banking transactions (which rely on\u000a      GPS-derived timing), some mobile phone networks and emergency service\u000a      communications. The protection of these systems in vital to the daily\u000a      operation of a nation's critical infrastructure.\u000a    The research was first funded under an EPSRC Advanced Fellowship\u000a      (GR\/S49599\/01, 2004-9) and involved making ionospheric scintillation\u000a      measurements by GPS receivers [1] and methods for data analysis. Expertise\u000a      in the detailed analysis of GPS signals was necessary to help eliminate\u000a      anomalies in the measurements, in particular through examination of the\u000a      carrier-to-noise ratios. Anomalous behaviour in the GPS system was being\u000a      tracked by Bath's mathematical analysis that had been developed after\u000a      recording GPS signals from a highly specialised receiver [2, 3]. Key to\u000a      the approach was the development of statistical methods for\u000a      differentiating between environmental effects and those resulting from\u000a      anomalous interference. The Bath team's knowledge of the so-called\u000a      `normal' behaviour of the system allowed them to design and develop new\u000a      algorithms that showed extraordinary sensitivity to any anomalous\u000a      behaviour in the time series of the carrier-to-noise ratio [2]. Not only\u000a      could they isolate anomalies but they could also discriminate between\u000a      different causes and in some circumstances locations, thus distinguishing\u000a      GPS jamming from natural environmental phenomena from malicious\u000a      intentional criminal activity.\u000a    The underpinning research led to Technology Strategy Board (TSB) projects\u000a      GAARDIAN and SENTINEL that enabled a continuation of the basic research\u000a      and its extension in to applications (TSB\/EPSRC grants TS\/G002592\/1;\u000a      TS\/I00257X\/1, 2008-2012). Led by the founder and MD of the UK SME company,\u000a      Chronos Technology, a consortium of academia and industry was formed to\u000a      take the research outputs from Bath and to build them into a network that\u000a      could provide a warning service across the whole of the UK. The SENTINEL\u000a      consortium included as partners and research beneficiaries the General\u000a      Lighthouse Authority (maritime navigation), Ordnance Survey (land-based\u000a      surveying), National Physical Laboratory (timing standards), Thatcham\u000a      (vehicle security) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO,\u000a      national security interests). Within these TSB projects Bath devised and\u000a      developed sensors known as Interference Detection and Monitoring sensors\u000a      (IDM) and a series of algorithms for interpreting the data from these were\u000a      based on the need to identify and reject interference in GPS. The IDM\u000a        devices now allow the location of a GPS jammer to be identified in real\u000a        time, protecting many systems that are vital to the daily operations of\u000a        a nation's infrastructure and security.

The most effective form of treatment for Parkinson's\u000d\u000a      Disease symptoms is a drug called levodopa, but approximately 90% of\u000d\u000a      patients who take it for ten years or more develop severe side effects\u000d\u000a      including involuntary movements called dyskinesia, a major source of\u000d\u000a      disability severely affecting the patient's quality of life. In\u000d\u000a      conventional practice, physicians rely on patients' own descriptions or,\u000d\u000a      in severe cases, patients are admitted to hospital for several days, to\u000d\u000a      monitor symptoms and adjust their medication accordingly. This system\u000d\u000a      provides an objective measure of dyskinesia over extended time periods\u000d\u000a      permitting a better informed course of medication, thereby reducing\u000d\u000a      unplanned hospital admissions, consultations and greatly improving the\u000d\u000a      patient's quality of life.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    CFMD &#8212; Computer-Assisted Marking of the Benson Figure Test\u000d\u000a    (Protected by patent application PCT\/GB13\/051889)\u000d\u000a    The Benson Figure Test is used throughout the United States to asses\u000d\u000a      decline in visuo-spatial ability, an important symptom of Alzheimer's\u000d\u000a      disease. However, conventional scoring of patients' responses is\u000d\u000a      subjective and therefore lacks sensitivity. Biologically inspired\u000d\u000a      algorithms have been used at the UCSF [8] and VA Medical Centers [9] to\u000d\u000a      analyze the dynamic characteristics of patients' pen movements during the\u000d\u000a      drawing process. This provides additional objective measures that are\u000d\u000a      better able to detect mild impairment than the conventional scoring\u000d\u000a      systems, permitting an earlier and more secure diagnosis.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These products have had significant impacts in the following areas:\u000d\u000a    i) Routine clinical assessment of neurodegenerative (brain) disorders\u000d\u000a    Clinical studies at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospitals in 2007,\u000d\u000a      Leeds General Infirmary in 2010 (NHRES 08\/H0903\/36) and 2012 (NHRES\u000d\u000a      10\/H1308\/5) demonstrated PDMD improves diagnostic accuracy for Parkinson's\u000d\u000a      Disease from 75% to over 90% [7].

Its advantages over traditional forms\u000d\u000a      of evolutionary algorithms, based around its implicit context\u000d\u000a      representation, have been reported in a series of investigations conducted\u000d\u000a      by Smith's group [1].

ABNs were developed at York from\u000d\u000a      2008-13 as part of the EPSRC AlBiNo project [5] and can be coupled to\u000d\u000a      complex dynamical systems, performing difficult computational behaviors\u000d\u000a      such as control and classification [5]. When combined with IRCGP these\u000d\u000a      algorithms can discriminate between Parkinson's disease patients and\u000d\u000a      age-matched controls with accuracies exceeding 90% - a significant\u000d\u000a      improvement on existing diagnosis of 75% [6].\u000d\u000a    These biologically inspired algorithms have been integrated with\u000d\u000a      commercially available hardware such as electromagnetic tracking sensors,\u000d\u000a      accelerometers, high performance data gloves and digitizing tablets to\u000d\u000a      record over 100 patients' movements in detail as they perform a variety of\u000d\u000a      conventional clinical tasks.

The original IEEE 299 standard\u000a      covered the larger room sized enclosures. This latest version, 299.1,\u000a      covers typical equipment enclosures (Marvin and students Yong Cui, 2003 - 2007\u000a\u0009  and Yuhui He, 2005 - 2009). YES has also sponsored a research student\u000a      (Armstrong 2008 to 2012) to undertake part of this work. Marvin is a\u000a      Vice-Chair of the associated Standard Development Working Group.\u000a    (iii) Improved modelling for composite materials\u000a    The use of composite materials has become common over the last decade for\u000a      the construction of vehicle bodies where they offer significant weight and\u000a      structural advantages and for equipment enclosures where cost and weight\u000a      reduction can be achieved. The novel measurement cell and Marvin's\u000a      colleagues' (Flintoft, J Dawson) work on the modelling of these materials\u000a      and their structures has been applied to airframe applications through the\u000a      EU FP7 HIRF-SE programme , which includes the majority of major airframe\u000a      manufacturers as part of the 43 strong consortium, including Alenia\u000a      Aeronautica (co-ordinator), Augusta Westland, BAE Systems, EADS, Thales.\u000a      The new measurement techniques have delivered efficient modelling of the\u000a      complex structures through the Finite Time-Domain Solver in the HIRF SE\u000a      framework and have enabled validation of models for multilayer composites\u000a      (see figure 2) and the electromagnetic performance of structural joints\u000a      within the HIRF-SE research programme. These new modelling techniques are\u000a      accessible for commercial use to all partners in the programme through the\u000a      HIRF SE Framework [I9, I10].\u000a\u000aFigure 2 - Carbon fibre woven structural material and the novel digital filter architecture of the material implemented in the numerical model in the HIRF-SE Framework [I9, I10].\u000a\u0009  \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    One of the main functions of enclosures around electronic systems is to\u000a      shield electromagnetic fields and reduce their interference with other\u000a      systems.

Shielding Effectiveness (SE) is\u000a      assessed by measuring the ratio of internal to external fields around the\u000a      enclosure. Conventional approaches to measuring SE were designed for\u000a      metallic, room sized enclosures, where the contents typically occupied\u000a      less than 10% of the enclosure volume (volume fill). These attained high\u000a      SE ratios in excess of 100dB.\u000a    Today many enclosures are made of composite materials with inherently\u000a      lower shielding performance than metal. Enclosure apertures for\u000a      ventilation, access and displays reduce the SE further and the electronic\u000a      contents produce a significantly larger volume fill. Conventional methods\u000a      do not rigorously measure SE of enclosures with these properties.\u000a    Marvin and his group at the University of York have undertaken a number\u000a      of inter-related strands of research which have progressed in parallel to\u000a      produce new techniques to improve the measurement of the SE of two\u000a      different classes of enclosure :\u000a    \u000a      Smaller enclosures specifically designed to house electronic\u000a        equipment, e.g. PC housings, often made of composite materials.\u000a      Structures that have a secondary shielding function e.g. airframes,\u000a        also made from composite materials.\u000a    \u000a    Although very different in size, these enclosures have the properties\u000a      mentioned above in common.\u000a    Predicated on the assumption that the function of enclosures is to\u000a      minimise the flow of electromagnetic energy to and from the enclosure\u000a      contents, Marvin has advanced techniques for the measurement of these\u000a      enclosures with larger volume fills:\u000a    \u000a      A set of instrumented representative contents capable of\u000a        standardisation have been developed [1]. Rather than measuring the empty\u000a        enclosure field ratio, the ratio of enclosure contents absorbed power to\u000a        the incident electromagnetic power density is measured.\u000a      Statistical approaches have been developed to accurately measure the\u000a        environment around the enclosures, with particular reference to\u000a        measurements at microwave frequencies [2].\u000a      These statistical approaches have been extended to measure the SE of\u000a        circuit card level enclosures [3].\u000a    \u000a    One significant problem with the measurement of composite materials is\u000a      that the conducting components that give the shielding performance may be\u000a      buried in a non-conducting substrate. Conventional shielding measurement\u000a      techniques require edge connection to the conducting components. Marvin\u000a      has developed approaches for the measurement and prediction of the SE of\u000a      inhomogeneous composite materials [4], including the development of a\u000a      novel measurement cell, designed to overcome the major limitation of edge\u000a      connection, with its performance optimised using numerical modelling [5]\u000a      (figure 1 below). Extension of the use of this measurement cell has\u000a      allowed the examination of the shielding properties of structural features\u000a      such as joints and is being used to develop measurement based macro-models\u000a      of these features for inclusion in full-size simulations of airframes [6,\u000a      7].\u000a    Marvin's team have developed efficient digital filter based techniques\u000a      for incorporation into time-stepping full-wave solvers which have\u000a      underpinned and informed the measurement work. These enable the modelling\u000a      of frequency-dependent dissipative materials and fine scale structural\u000a      features such as joints seams and apertures.\u000a    Initial work was on the BAES\/EPSRC FLAVIIR programme (BAES, EPSRC, nine\u000a      academic partners &#8212; Staff; J Dawson, L Dawson, Marvin, Robinson, Flintoft;\u000a      2005-7).

A US-based start-up, Novelx Inc. successfully trialled\u000a      and used the source to realise the first and still the only commercially\u000a      available desktop, field emission Scanning Electron Microscope (2008),\u000a      approximately the same size as a laser printer. Their desktop SEM product,\u000a      MySEM, won the USA Prestigious R&amp;D 100 Award for Innovative\u000a      Scanning Electron Microscope (2009). MySEM is now in use in\u000a      several top US academic and research laboratories including MIT, Berkeley\u000a      and the Naval Research Labs for research into nanotechnology, MEMS and\u000a      polymers as well as process development, verification and failure analysis\u000a      in laboratories.\u000a    In 2010, Agilent Technologies acquired Novelx for an undisclosed sum [2].\u000a      The desktop SEM (8500 FE-SEM [3, 4) retails for [text removed for\u000a        publication] (less than half the price of a conventional SEM),\u000a      bringing it within reach of a far wider market. Furthermore, it occupies a\u000a      footprint of less than 3 cubic feet; significantly smaller than\u000a      conventional room-sized SEMs, again allowing it to be used in a wider\u000a      range of applications and locations such as clean rooms and confined\u000a      areas. Since the Agilent acquisition, it is estimated that more than [text\u000a        removed for publication] have been sold world-wide [1]. Lawrence\u000a      Murray, Director of R&amp;D at FESEM for Agilent Technologies says \"This\u000a      product particularly stands out from others in this market because it\u000a      provides customers the only desktop tool with enough resolution and\u000a      surface fidelity to image features at nanoscale dimensions.\" and \"Without\u000a      the novel TFE work of Professor El-Gomati ... this type of tool would not\u000a      have been possible.\" [1]\u000a    High angular intensity Schottky electron source.\u000a    As a result of the collaboration with Shimadzu they have, to date,\u000a      invested [text removed for publication] in the evaluation and\u000a      refinement of the new cathode. The work has now been transferred to their\u000a      Business Production Division, and they are making significant investment\u000a      through a team of a dozen engineers with the aim of launching \"the most\u000a      powerful electron beam instrument to the world\" [8].\u000a    LaB6 in `Virtual Source Mode'\u000a    Together with project partner, Carl Zeiss (UK), a conventional thermionic\u000a      electron cathode, using a lanthanum hexaboride crystal (LaB6)\u000a      as the electron source, was configured to be used in the virtual source\u000a      mode [5]. This configuration provides three benefits in comparison to\u000a      operation in the thermionic mode 1) a smaller source size by a factor of\u000a      more than 10 times, 2) a reduced initial energy spread of the emitted\u000a      electrons by approximately 3-4 times and 3) increased source brightness of\u000a      approximately 10 times on its value when operated in the conventional\u000a      mode. These factors lead to a smaller beam size for a given beam current\u000a      and allow one to use a lower beam voltage than previously necessary.\u000a    The advantages of these features are that they allow users of this\u000a      instrument to investigate radiation sensitive and insulating materials at\u000a      much higher resolution than previously possible. In addition, operating\u000a      this class of cathodes in the virtual source mode, whilst similar to a\u000a      field emitter, does not require altering the shape of the commercially\u000a      available cathode to produce a sharp needle as is required for the more\u000a      expensive field emitters. Further, the vacuum requirements of the LaB6\u000a      electron cathode in this mode are only high vacuum which is much simpler\u000a      and less expensive to achieve than UHV.\u000a    This virtual source mode of operation was used by Carl Zeiss SMT\u000a      (Cambridge, UK) in developing a new and unprecedented generation of SEM &#8212;\u000a      the `EVO HD' ([6],[7],[8]) launched in 2011. This instrument, which is\u000a      less expensive (approx. half the price) than an FE-SEM, has high imaging\u000a      capabilities at lower beam energies (&lt;2keV) &#8212; an essential feature,\u000a      especially for radiation sensitive materials, such as biological and\u000a      medical materials, novel photoresists, nanotubes and nanorods. Dr. S.\u000a      Beam, Physics manager at Zeiss said [5]: \"This instrument has the best\u000a      performance of any conventional scanning electron microscope whilst\u000a      maintaining a price that is both acceptable for a conventional microscope\u000a      and lower than any high performance, field emission based, microscope.\u000a      EVO&#174; HD instruments have been sold within Europe, North America and the UK\u000a      with other regions expected to follow in due course.\"\u000a    Low Voltage Microscopy\u000a    The semiconductor industry remains the single largest beneficiary of the\u000a      advances and developments made in electron microscopy. SEMs occupy a key\u000a      role in quality control assessment, where for example Critical Dimension\u000a      SEMs (or CD-SEMs) are a major tool for critical dimension measurement, as\u000a      well as for defect review analysis.\u000a    Research in this low voltage microscopy mode, has led to a better\u000a      understanding of the signals obtained from the SEM. The understanding\u000a      coming from this research underpins the growing use of low voltage SEM\u000a      with its superior surface contrast, thus allowing nanoscale features to be\u000a      observed on a wide variety of nanostructured materials, including\u000a      polymers, thin films, biomaterials, and other energy-sensitive samples on\u000a      any substrate, even glass. For example, using low voltage SEMs (&lt;5keV),\u000a      it is now possible to differentiate between differently doped\u000a      semiconductors (i.e. p- and n-types; the fundamental building blocks in\u000a      semiconductor devices).\u000a    Low and variable voltage operation of the SEM also negates the\u000a      requirement for coating insulating materials that would charge up under a\u000a      given electron beam energy, leading to both efficiency savings (as the\u000a      materials do not need to be coated) and the removal of interference from\u000a      the coatings in the images themselves.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since the 1950s, when they were first developed, scanning electron\u000a      microscopes (SEMs) have revolutionised science.

Having to rely on a\u000a      centralised SEM for imaging hampers the innovation process and can delay\u000a      the time to market. Researchers and developers are forced to plan their\u000a      research and product development programs around the limited availability\u000a      of a centralised SEM. Furthermore, conventional SEMs are limited to solid,\u000a      inorganic samples small enough to fit inside the vacuum chamber that can\u000a      handle moderate vacuum pressure.\u000a    In order to overcome some of these limitations, Professor El-Gomati and\u000a      his team from the Department of Electronics at the University of York,\u000a      have been developing and carrying out research on the electron source for\u000a      electron microscopy. There are two electron source types used in electron\u000a      microscopes: thermionic and field emission. Thermionic sources only\u000a      require high vacuum for their operation but suffer from a large source\u000a      size (&gt;10f06dm), short lifetime (~ 100s hrs), emit electrons with a\u000a      spread in their initial energies (&gt;1.5eV), and added together cause\u000a      large final beam sizes, which are not suitable to resolve nanostructures.\u000a      Field emission sources have smaller source size (~30nm), a small energy\u000a      spread (&lt;0.6eV), a longer life time (&gt;10,000hrs) and are therefore\u000a      becoming increasingly popular &#8212; especially for nano-scale technologies.\u000a      However, conventional field emission sources are limited in voltage used\u000a      (3,000-5,000V) and the corresponding current density (300-500f06dA\/str).\u000a      Whilst this suited the existing microscope technology, operating outside\u000a      these parameters to suit new developments proved inaccessible, leading to\u000a      beam current instability (for low current density operation) or the\u000a      source's total destruction, when operated for high current applications.\u000a      The York team have improved the electron source in three major ways and\u000a      has helped improve the understanding of low energy SEM imaging.\u000a    Miniaturisation of field emission technologies. This\u000a      research in electron optics and field emission cathodes has led to the\u000a      development of several small-sized electron columns, some measure &lt;10cm\u000a      in height, typically 10 times smaller than conventional column sizes. This\u000a      development, which is based on using electrostatic electrodes instead of\u000a      the normally used magnetic coils that require water cooling, is vitally\u000a      important in reducing the size of SEMs. In addition, SEM miniaturisation\u000a      requires low voltage cathodes, and this trend of miniaturisation led to\u000a      the development of an integrated cathode-extractor electrode as part of a\u000a      pre-aligned column [1, 2].\u000a    High angular intensity Schottky electron source. Operating\u000a      conventional Schottky emitters beyond 0.5mA\/str leads to their\u000a      destruction, which has limited their use in high current applications.\u000a      El-Gomati and his group have been researching alternative source\u000a      configurations where the electron optical characteristics of the electron\u000a      gun part are (focal properties) taken into consideration when realising\u000a      the electron emitter. In collaboration with Shimadzu Corp. of Japan,\u000a      El-Gomati and co-workers have developed a new Schottky emitter capable of\u000a      operating well beyond 1mA\/str. [3]\u000a    Operating a LaB6 cathode in `Virtual\u000a          source Mode' Operating ultra-high vacuum (UHV), as is required\u000a      for field emitters, is both expensive and time consuming. Lanthanum\u000a      hexaboride (LaB6) electron guns depend on thermionic emission\u000a      of electrons from a heated LaB6 crystal, which are ~10x\u000a      brighter than tungsten and have significantly longer lifetimes, but\u000a      require higher vacuum levels, often increasing the SEM's cost. The\u000a      emitting area of LaB6 is large thus reducing its brightness and\u000a      consequently its beam current capability. El-Gomati and co-workers\u000a      demonstrated in 2010 [3] the advantages of operating the LaB6\u000a      cathode in the field emission mode. In doing so, they were able to exploit\u000a      smaller energy spread and source size than in the thermionic mode, which\u000a      led to a higher brightness source that is essential for high resolution\u000a      microscopy [4].\u000a    Low Voltage Microscopy Research in low voltage microscopy\u000a      mode, led to a better understanding of the signals obtained from the SEM.\u000a      A new model describing the mechanism of image contrast was proposed in\u000a      2001 [5] and a set of guiding rules to assist users was published in 2005\u000a      [6]. Further research in low voltage SEM led to a systematic study of\u000a      backscattered and secondary electron emission signals forming SEM images.\u000a      El-Gomati's research led to an overhaul of the accepted theory (60 years\u000a      old), explaining secondary electron emission (Cosslett award, MSA, USA;\u000a      2008).\u000a    This research was carried out at the University of York, led by Professor\u000a      El-Gomati (at York as Professor since 1998). Others involved in this\u000a      research at York are: Roberts, Kudjoe, Bakush, and Zaggout (PhD students)\u000a      and Prutton,Tear, and Wilson (Research Associates).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43504","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    LU's interdisciplinary model based systems engineering (MBSE) research as\u000a      cited in section 2 and 3 (2001-2010) has directly enabled life-saving\u000a      operations by i) Developing synthetic vision systems to improve safety of\u000a      emergency services helicopter operations involving low level flight during\u000a      day, night, all weather and conditions of zero visibility, and ii) Saving\u000a      lives through a reduction in morbidity and mortality of babies born with\u000a      congenital heart defects.\u000a    The impact translates directly into significant cost savings and safety\u000a      risk reductions in expensive flight trials costing millions of pounds by\u000a      BAE Systems [5.1], and in clinical practice\/surgical interventions\u000a      by University Hospital of Rennes [5.2] with a reduction in the\u000a      morbidity and mortality of babies born with congenital heart defects.\u000a    LU's integrative cross-discipline MBSE research has solved previously\u000a      intractable challenges by developing new techniques in\u000a      multi-disciplinary\/multi-scale modelling and simulation. The consequences\u000a      of the impact are diverse and have wide reach across different domains and\u000a      not confined to the two examples described below.\u000a    i) Synthetic vision systems to improve safety of helicopter operations\u000a        involving low level flight during day, night and all weather to zero\u000a        visibility\u000a    The goal was to enable the emergency services, military and other\u000a      services to operate into day and night, under adverse weather conditions,\u000a      through the safe use of synthetic vision (thus enabling operations in\u000a      hazardous conditions), addressing the big challenge of presenting\u000a      time-critical sensor information to the aircrew. In order to fly at\u000a      low-level and high-speed in these extremely adverse conditions, a suite of\u000a      active\/passive sensors capable of detecting hazards must be integrated to\u000a      present a synthetic display of the outside world to the pilot. However,\u000a      combining sensory information from multiple sensors (operating in\u000a      different wavelengths\/modalities) with on-board databases has previously\u000a      been an intractable problem due to the time critical nature of the\u000a      information. Before a synthetic display system can be cleared for flight\u000a      the system must be tested under complex and inherently expensive\u000a      flight-trials in representative operational conditions. Such flight-trials\u000a      involve testing in extreme conditions that are currently outside flying\u000a      regulations with all hazards including terrain, building structures,\u000a      telegraph wires, pylons, and aerial masts. Such tests expose the crew and\u000a      helicopter to serious risks where the crew and helicopter could be lost.\u000a      Consequently, each new system concept must be tested which leading to\u000a      escalations in costs and risks.\u000a    Applying the research results [3.1-3.3] in conjunction with [G3.1-G3.7]\u000a      enabled Loughborough to implement a comprehensive coupled-model systems\u000a      simulator which integrated real-time models (atmosphere, on-board sensors,\u000a      sensor performance, system performance, helicopter flight dynamics,\u000a      synthetic vision display presentation and models of human reaction\u000a      time\/behaviour). The heterogeneous model based simulator directly enabled\u000a      BAE Systems to rapidly evaluate simulations of candidate synthetic vision\u000a      systems with time critical information symbology before commencement of\u000a      flight trials. This simulator enabled the development of highly effective\u000a      visually-coupled head-mounted augmented reality perceptual cue displays\u000a      comprising synthetic information, including accommodating the implications\u000a      and rationale of 2000m visibility (dictated by air regulations). The\u000a      simulator took the place of early flight trials and reduced the number of\u000a      flight tests that had to be undertaken by identifying conflicting sensory\u000a      and perceptual cues so that they could be excluded from flight trials.\u000a      Consequently, months of flight development time and significant costs\u000a      (&#163;millions) were saved along with the inherent reduction in crew risks and\u000a      improved safety enhancement through use of the simulator. This research\u000a      was subjected to a detailed integrity assessment (involving calibration\u000a      against real-world flight trials and helicopter sensor\/system\u000a      performance), proving it comprehensively addressed perceptual issues of\u000a      spatial awareness, and range to interference (collisions with pylons,\u000a      terrain, telephone poles etc.) in obscured visibility conditions.\u000a    Loughborough also developed key augmented reality perceptual cues that\u000a      were presented via the visually coupled (head-mounted) display ensuring\u000a      appropriate pilot evasive action could be taken within human reaction\u000a      times. The simulator was validated constantly against the flight test\u000a      vehicle enabling a comprehensive safety integrity assessment to address\u000a      the issue of perceptual spatial awareness and range to interference in\u000a      obscured visibility conditions. Loughborough's mathematical model of\u000a      spatial error in relation to the obstacle profiles formed a key part of\u000a      the safety case. Comprehensive simulator trials provided significant\u000a      development timesavings and reduced risks leading to effective perceptual\u000a      display symbology through testing of concepts prior to flight-testing in\u000a      the Lynx helicopter (Army Air Corps base &#8212; Middle Whallop). Benefits are\u000a      significant for all helicopter operators by offering unprecedented\u000a      increase in safety whilst extending current limited operational envelopes.\u000a    ii) Saving lives through a reduction in morbidity and mortality of\u000a        babies born with congenital heart defects\u000a    Significant impact has accrued through a reduction in morbidity and\u000a      mortality of babies born with congenital heart defects (the congenital\u000a      heart defect known as the `tetralogy of Fallot'). This is one of the most\u000a      common cyanotic heart defects, affecting 20% of babies born with a\u000a      congenital heart defect. LU's multi-scale systems models have advanced the\u000a      theoretical knowledge and understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that\u000a      underpin the clinical condition. Since 2012, 591 babies in Brittany (i.e.\u000a      population served by Rennes who were diagnosed with the condition) have\u000a      had their treatment and surgical intervention significantly influenced by\u000a      the research through its adoption by the only Paediatric Cardiologist\u000a      (Prof J-M. Schleich) based in Brittany. LU's multi-scale systems models\u000a      confirm the hypotheses of findings from the wet biologists\u000a      (experimentalists) &#8212; and have for the first time allowed the paediatric\u000a      cardiologists at the University Hospital of Rennes (CHU) to integrate\u000a      findings from geneticists, cell biologists, and pathologists to gain a\u000a      more complete understanding of this congenital heart defect. The use of\u000a      multi-scale systems engineering, has allowed modelling of clinical\u000a      findings and their patho-physiological underpinnings to take place. With\u000a      the addition of CHU's work in medical imaging of heart specimens it has\u000a      been possible to pin-point the anatomical landmarks important for the\u000a      diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot.\u000a    Our unifying cross-discipline MBSE research has solved previously\u000a      intractable challenges confirming the wide diversity\/applicability of the\u000a      research.

Over the past decade MBSE has slowly\u000a      become the preferred technique for designing and understanding\u000a      increasingly complex systems (in terms of performance, behaviour and their\u000a      emergent properties). However, the overarching question has been \"how to\u000a      model and simulate complex systems across multi-disciplinary boundaries?\"\u000a      Research underpinning the impact here has given rise to novel simulation\u000a      solutions across multi-disciplinary and multi-scale boundaries that\u000a      successfully addressed this challenge by creating heterogeneous, coupled\u000a      simulation environments. Research by Prof Kalawsky (Professor at LU since\u000a      1995 to present) was undertaken through a succession of projects and\u000a      developed important innovative steps to create\u000a      multi-disciplinary\/multi-scale MBSE simulation environments.

Key influencers underpinning the research included:\u000a    \u000a      EPSRC's e-Science RealityGrid funding enabled Kalawsky to extend\u000a        heterogeneous modelling within a distributed simulation environment and\u000a        its associated interactive visualization by exploiting visualization\u000a        system architectures [G3.1 and G3.2] [Kalawsky, Nee (PhD\u000a        1996-2001), Dr O'Brien (Research Associate at LU 2008-2012) and Holmes\u000a        PhD (2004-2011)].

The novel\u000a          methods developed at\u000a          Loughborough include second order cone programming based robust\u000a          designs to tackle\u000a          channel uncertainties in the propagation environment.

The impact has\u000d\u000a      been on reduced uncertainties in calibration and energy yield prediction.\u000d\u000a      The impact of calibration or power measurements is largely on the retail\u000d\u000a      value of photovoltaics. Energy impacts on the operation and finance side\u000d\u000a      of the business.\u000d\u000a    Photovoltaics (PV) is a new energy technology, and one of the key factors\u000d\u000a      slowing down market developments is a perceived risk in the installation\u000d\u000a      of these technologies. There are several different technologies competing\u000d\u000a      for market shares in the field. The devices are rated at standard test\u000d\u000a      conditions and one watt at these conditions would be termed watt-peak, Wp.\u000d\u000a      The overall market size in 2012 is of more than 28 GWp annual installation\u000d\u000a      in 2012, with an installation cost of slightly under 1&#163;\/Wp in the majority\u000d\u000a      of markets.\u000d\u000a    Calibration uncertainty is a risk in the value of the overall market. In\u000d\u000a      today's market (June 2013), one percent uncertainty equates to 750M$\/a\u000d\u000a      [5.1]. The team (Prof Gottschalg, Dr. Betts) was instrumental in reducing\u000d\u000a      this as demonstrated e.g. in the EU project Performance where the\u000d\u000a      calibration uncertainty of leading test laboratories was reduced from 5%\u000d\u000a      to less than 2% in standardised power measurements for crystalline silicon\u000d\u000a      and from more than 10% to about 5% for thin film photovoltaics [5.8]. The\u000d\u000a      underlying research which contributed to this was carried out during the\u000d\u000a      Fellowship and the FENRA project and was published amongst other papers in\u000d\u000a      [3.3, 3.5]. The transfer into standards was achieved by contributing to\u000d\u000a      the standard development and the participating bi-annual meetings and\u000d\u000a      appropriate working groups. Prof Gottschalg led the project team for\u000d\u000a      IEC60904-5, which is the most accurate method to extract the cell\u000d\u000a      temperature. Each degree measurement uncertainty in the temperature\u000d\u000a      contributes about 0.5% to the calibration uncertainty, the standard is\u000d\u000a      capable of sub-degree accuracy, while external measurements result in 2-3oC\u000d\u000a      temperature uncertainty. Prof Gottschalg was also on the project team for\u000d\u000a      IEC60904-7, IEC60904-3, IEC60904-9, IEC60904-10 and IEC60891. Each of\u000d\u000a      these standards is a crucial element of the calibration process and has\u000d\u000a      distinct elements linking to work carried out by the team in one of the\u000d\u000a      research projects. It can be assumed that at least 95% of the PV modules\u000d\u000a      produced in the world have been assessed based on the IEC60904 series of\u000d\u000a      characterisation standards and corrected to standard test conditions using\u000d\u000a      IEC60891. Most subsidy schemes require these numbers making the\u000d\u000a      application of these standards mandatory.\u000d\u000a    Energy yield uncertainty is a risk on the income generated from an\u000d\u000a      installation and thus the financial viability of any investment. The\u000d\u000a      impact claimed here is the better understanding of uncertainties [3.2,\u000d\u000a      3.6] and better measurements [3.5] and paving the way for standard\u000d\u000a      datasets [3.4]. The impact is difficult to quantify, as production and\u000d\u000a      costs vary for different countries. There are about 100 GWp installed\u000d\u000a      world-wide [5.9], and about 2.5 GWp in the UK. In the UK a system produces\u000d\u000a      around 850 kWh\/kWp and the value of a kWh (FIT + self-consumption\/ or\u000d\u000a      generation credit) around 0.2&#163;. Thus the impact of one percent uncertainty\u000d\u000a      in production is well in the order of 34M&#163;\/a in the UK alone. Uncertainty\u000d\u000a      exists because of a lack of standardised simulations, lack of standardised\u000d\u000a      environmental inputs and lack of validation of existing methodologies on\u000d\u000a      statistical numbers of installations.\u000d\u000a    The work of the team has been utilised in the published standards\u000d\u000a      IEC61853-1 and the FDIS IEC61853-2. The work on mapping together with Huld\u000d\u000a      et al [3.4] is the foundation of the standard datasets (IEC61853-3). The\u000d\u000a      transfer of research work has been achieved by Prof Gottschalg being part\u000d\u000a      of the project teams and a general recognition of the work by the team.\u000d\u000a      Overall, the work carried out by the team or managed by the team\u000d\u000a      (PV-Performance, PV-Catapult) have resulted in an enhanced understanding\u000d\u000a      of the uncertainties involved and a subsequent reduction of the simulation\u000d\u000a      uncertainty by 2% [5.8].\u000d\u000a    Key in achieving this impact was participation in the international\u000d\u000a      standards body of Prof Gottschalg. Standards are developed by the\u000d\u000a      International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and CENELEC in Europe,\u000d\u000a      with collaborations between the two standard bodies. These normally get\u000d\u000a      mirrored by national standards, which is the responsibility of the British\u000d\u000a      Standards Institution (BSi) in the UK. Prof Gottschalg is active on all\u000d\u000a      these bodies as confirmed by [5.1-5.6].\u000d\u000a    These standards have been elemental in the market growth. Without these\u000d\u000a      standards enabling the PV deployment, the market would not have grown at\u000d\u000a      the current speed as other technologies have demonstrated with less\u000d\u000a      rigorous standards. In terms of overall market acceleration, the body of\u000d\u000a      work has been essential to further this sustainable technology.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A reduction in planning uncertainties and financial risks of\u000d\u000a      photovoltaics has been achieved by developing internationally accepted\u000d\u000a      standards. Non-standardised characterisation and unreliable energy\u000d\u000a      prediction caused a performance gap between expectations and realistic\u000d\u000a      yields. Loughborough University (Prof. Gottschalg, Dr. Betts) conducted a\u000d\u000a      series of research projects since 1999 which reduced this performance gap.\u000d\u000a      The team consciously transferred developed methods to international\u000d\u000a      standards for energy prediction and device characterisation.\u000d\u000a      Standardisation has, with significant contributions from this team,\u000d\u000a      resulted in the reporting period in a reduction of at least 2% calibration\u000d\u000a      uncertainty, which has a value at today's prices of $1.500,000,000 per\u000d\u000a      year (J.

It also enabled a modification of the\u000d\u000a      IEC6004-5 standard that was then written up as a standard by Prof.\u000d\u000a      Gottschalg. 3.3 &amp; 3.5 are examples of the resulting work.\u000d\u000a    - Technology specific effects. Different PVg technologies behave\u000d\u000a      differently. G3.5, G3.3, G3.2 and G3.4 considered specific technologies\u000d\u000a      and how these could be measured in a standardised way to reduce\u000d\u000a      uncertainty. 3.2 and 3.3 are examples of the resulting work.\u000d\u000a    - Understanding the actual operating environments. One\u000d\u000a      overarching aim of the work conducted at Loughborough University is to\u000d\u000a      create energy rating standards. This requires the generation of\u000d\u000a      standardised data sets. G3.1, G3.4 and G3.5 worked on this, with a\u000d\u000a      particular link to the European Joint Research Centre's European Solar\u000d\u000a      Test Institute (ESTI) based in Ispra.\u000d\u000a    - Modelling the actual site dependent performance. The strength\u000d\u000a      of the Loughborough team is the modelling of the incident spectrum and the\u000d\u000a      input into the relevant standard sections can be attributed to the\u000d\u000a      submitting team. Work on this was carried out in G3.2, G3.3 and G3.5.\u000d\u000a    The detailed metrological research has resulted in a number of innovative\u000d\u000a      procedures of how to minimise the uncertainty in measurements or how to\u000d\u000a      assess the uncertainty in `non-standard' measurements, which were\u000d\u000a      previously assessed by broad assumptions. These measurements are key for\u000d\u000a      an accurate energy prediction as e.g. shown in G3.4 that the metrology of\u000d\u000a      devices is one of the two dominant sources of modelling uncertainty. The\u000d\u000a      detailed assessment methodologies, as e.g. presented in R3.6, enabled the\u000d\u000a      reduction of measurement uncertainty by working on the appropriate\u000d\u000a      components.\u000d\u000a    It is not always possible to measure the required parameters for any\u000d\u000a      model. The team has developed new measurement apparatuses (G3.3, G3.5)\u000d\u000a      that allow the measurement of device parameters with to date unbeatable\u000d\u000a      repeatability and thus allows a much more accurate assessment of e.g.\u000d\u000a      spectral effects in the laboratory. As an example, the combination of\u000d\u000a      spectral, thermal and intensity changes demonstrated in 3.5, which was the\u000d\u000a      basis of G3.5, has not been achieved since and was the first qualified\u000d\u000a      solar simulator based on LED technology.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43616","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    TFSL has seen a rapid growth in business through the proven performance\u000d\u000a      of this retrofittable\u000d\u000a      plasma source.

He\u000d\u000a      pioneered the production of\u000d\u000a      so-called rugate filters for laser notch filters from 1993 to 2002 using a\u000d\u000a      simple reactive sputtering\u000d\u000a      technique, but with very careful control of the reactive gases, oxygen and\u000d\u000a      nitrogen. This allowed\u000d\u000a      the production of narrow band reflection filters based on aluminium\u000d\u000a      oxynitride films, having a\u000d\u000a      periodic variation of refractive index with thickness. This led to the\u000d\u000a      award of the John Logie Baird\u000d\u000a      prize for Innovation in 1999 and was the catalyst for the subsequent\u000d\u000a      development of the Thin Film\u000d\u000a      Centre at UWS. An award of &#163;1.2 million from the Scottish Funding Council\u000d\u000a      allowed the purchase\u000d\u000a      and development of an advanced sputtering system, an electron-beam system\u000d\u000a      and\u000d\u000a      characterisation tools. This allowed continuing development of expertise\u000d\u000a      in materials and plasma-\u000d\u000a      assist processes to improve thin film properties for advanced optical\u000d\u000a      filters as required by the multi-\u000d\u000a      billion pound filter industry.\u000d\u000a    Electron-beam evaporation was, and still is, very widely used in\u000d\u000a      industry, but optical filters made by\u000d\u000a      this method suffer from a number of problems because of the relatively low\u000d\u000a      energy of the adatoms\u000d\u000a      arriving at the substrate. In particular, evaporated films have a rather\u000d\u000a      porous nano-structure that\u000d\u000a      makes them susceptible to the ingress of water vapour. This leads to\u000d\u000a      refractive index changes and\u000d\u000a      general deterioration in performance of such filters with time,\u000d\u000a      necessitating expensive\u000d\u000a      encapsulation. These optical filters also tend to have unacceptable levels\u000d\u000a      of absorption due to the\u000d\u000a      difficulty in ensuring stoichiometry of the metal oxides used as high and\u000d\u000a      low index materials.\u000d\u000a      Traditionally, high-temperature deposition and\/or subsequent annealing of\u000d\u000a      the films were used to\u000d\u000a      improve the density of evaporated films, but with limited success and\u000d\u000a      considerable extra time and\u000d\u000a      cost. Our research led naturally to the investigation of plasma-assisted\u000d\u000a      techniques where the\u000d\u000a      growing film is bombarded with argon ions and oxygen during deposition to\u000d\u000a      improve densification\u000d\u000a      and stoichiometry. In fact, many research groups and companies have tried\u000d\u000a      to develop ion guns\u000d\u000a      and plasma sources for this type of application, but the production of a\u000d\u000a      stable, wide-area source\u000d\u000a      that can operate reliably at e-beam deposition pressures for the many\u000d\u000a      hours of a deposition run\u000d\u000a      has proved a difficult nut to crack, particularly in a form that can\u000d\u000a      readily be retro-fitted to existing e-\u000d\u000a      beam chambers.\u000d\u000a    Our research initially developed a compact design of plasma source using\u000d\u000a      an inductively-heated\u000d\u000a      LaB6 cathode and novel ion extraction, producing high ion densities at the\u000d\u000a      optimum energies for\u000d\u000a      thin film enhancement. This has progressed by several innovative steps,\u000d\u000a      such as implementing a\u000d\u000a      hollow cathode effect in the electron emitter, removing the need for\u000d\u000a      inductive heating during\u000d\u000a      operation, thereby leading to considerable savings in operational costs.\u000d\u000a      The latest models use\u000d\u000a      modified magnetics with the aim of allowing operation at higher chamber\u000d\u000a      pressures.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43618","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In the EPSRC funded project (2003-2006) with Dupont Teijin Films Ltd,\u000d\u000a      Prof Placido and post-graduate researchers (Sarfaraz Moh, David Lusk and\u000d\u000a      Andrei Voronov) developed the first pinhole-free, dielectric ultra-barrier\u000d\u000a      coatings on novel heat-stabilised, planarised PEN substrates.

Prof Placido and\u000d\u000a      his team have used their extensive knowledge of plasma processes to\u000d\u000a      develop solutions to coating problems by manipulating thin film properties\u000d\u000a      at the nanoscale, in what can rightly be called atomic engineering. This\u000d\u000a      research spans a very large range of applications in diverse industries,\u000d\u000a      from solar cells and optical filters to corrosion resistant coatings on\u000d\u000a      the inside of pipelines.\u000d\u000a      Plastic electronics is currently a very hot topic and much of the\u000d\u000a      pioneering work demonstrating the potential was carried out at UWS in a\u000d\u000a      series of EPSRC\/DTI(TSB) funded projects.\u000d\u000a    One major problem to be solved was that while the glass substrates used\u000d\u000a      in conventional electronic display devices are virtually impervious to\u000d\u000a      water vapour and oxygen penetration, polymer substrates pass sufficient\u000d\u000a      water vapour and oxygen to destroy the organic semiconductors used in\u000d\u000a      plastic electronics in a matter of minutes. Prior art involved complex and\u000d\u000a      expensive multilayer coatings that were impractical and too expensive to\u000d\u000a      implement.\u000d\u000a      In the first EPSRC funded project (2003-2006) with Dupont Teijin Films\u000d\u000a      Ltd, Prof Placido and post-graduate researchers (Sarfaraz Moh, David Lusk\u000d\u000a      and Andrei Voronov) worked on the deposition of ultra-barrier coatings\u000d\u000a      while DTF developed novel planarised and heat stabilised PEN polymer\u000d\u000a      substrates. Our ability to successfully coat large areas of polymer\u000d\u000a      (3000mm x 300mm) allowed statistically significant results to be achieved\u000d\u000a      and repeatability to be demonstrated. The performance of our dense\u000d\u000a      inorganic films as ultra-barrier coatings has yet to be improved upon.\u000d\u000a      This work resulted in several conference papers and a worldwide patent\u000d\u000a      with DTF (Ref 1).\u000d\u000a    From 2004-2007, Prof Placido and post-doc Dr Shigeng Song worked with\u000d\u000a      Dupont Teijin Films Ltd and Plastic Logic Ltd on a DTI LINK funded project\u000d\u000a      to investigate the feasibility of producing an active matrix backplane on\u000d\u000a      a flexible substrate using semiconducting polymer TFTs. This work led to\u000d\u000a      the first demonstration of a small all-polymer display on PL's prototype\u000d\u000a      facility in Cambridge. In a later EPSRC\/LINK project (2007-2010) the same\u000d\u000a      partners worked on the manufacture of a practical A4 size display using\u000d\u000a      Plastic Logic's backplane, Dupont Teijin Films' planarised PET substrate\u000d\u000a      and e-Ink's display medium. Our contribution was to investigate the\u000d\u000a      electrical and mechanical properties of the metallisation layers. Major\u000d\u000a      aspects of this work were the investigation of high work-function coatings\u000d\u000a      based on dielectric and various metal multilayers. A major problem solved\u000d\u000a      in this project was the difficulty of demonstrating good adhesion of these\u000d\u000a      layers to each other and to the polymer substrate. Quantitative methods of\u000d\u000a      measuring adhesion and in-situ optical characterisation methods were\u000d\u000a      developed allowing clear distinction between the wide range of candidate\u000d\u000a      structures. A key finding was that a thin film of aluminium nitride gave\u000d\u000a      excellent adhesion to planarised polymers and also allowed the deposition\u000d\u000a      of a very high quality gold coating with overall excellent adhesion, even\u000d\u000a      after etching to produce 100 micron thick bus-lines.

For example,\u000a      conductive polymer fibres for\u000a      smart textiles are developed in partnership with CNT producer Nanocyl S.A.\u000a      (Belgium), while in the\u000a      field of thermolelectrics a partnership agreement exist with European\u000a      Thermodynamics. In the area\u000a      of high performance fibres, Nanoforce has recently become the preferred\u000a      research partner for\u000a      DSM Dyneema (Netherlands). Dyneema is a world-leader in high strength\u000a      polymer fibres and they\u000a      have selected Nanoforce as their main research partner because of its\u000a      expertise in fibre\u000a      technology and its ability to conduct research in an industrial facing\u000a      environment under full\u000a      confidentiality. Nanoforce has helped develop several products as well as\u000a      transferring knowledge\u000a      acquired from research. Prime examples of these are the, Sugru&#174;,\u000a      Zelfo&#174;, BiotexTM and\u000a      Kennametal case studies discussed below.\u000a    Sugru&#174; : FormFormForm is a young and\u000a      vibrant SME based company in East London. Its main\u000a      technology (Formarol) is a room temperature vulcanizing silicone rubber,\u000a      which is specially\u000a      formulated for handle-ability and cure kinetics. Sugru&#174;,\u000a      the brain child of FormFormForm's CEO\u000a      Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh, is the first commercial product based on this\u000a      technology. It resembles\u000a      modelling clay but sticks to almost anything and dries to a tough, rubbery\u000a      finish. It allows single\u000a      users to personalise, fix and modifying objects, devises or goods. Over\u000a      285,000 people in 138\u000a      countries are currently using it to make their stuff work better, or as\u000a      the company puts it, Sugru\u000a      `Hacks things better'. In 2008, because of its expertise in polymers and\u000a      rubbers (Busfield, Peijs,\u000a      Bilotti), Nanoforce was asked to assist in the development of Sugru.\u000a      Supported by a TSB\u000a      Feasibility Award, Nanoforce helped to create the silicone material that\u000a      would be sticky but would\u000a      also cure at room temperature. It provided advice on optimal processing\u000a      and production methods,\u000a      and the formulation of the current materials is a direct result of work\u000a      performed in the Nanoforce\u000a      labs. In November 2009, with a minute budget, FormFormForm started to\u000a      produce a small batch of\u000a      products. These first 1,000 packets of Sugru, which took a month to make,\u000a      sold out in six hours to\u000a      customers in 21 countries and where an instant hit. In 2010 TIME Magazine\u000a      listed Sugru alongside\u000a      the iPad as one of the top 50 inventions of that year, and in 2012 Jane Ni\u000a      Dhulchaointigh won the\u000a      `London Design Entrepreneur Award'. Currently Sugru is receiving massive\u000a      attention by different\u000a      medias, particularly social media, thus bypassing traditional routes to\u000a      market. Nanoforce\u000a      involvement in the development of Sugru had direct economic impact through\u000a      increased sales and\u000a      jobs created with FormFormForm now employing 30 people. It had sales of $1\u000a      million in 2011 and\u000a      doubled that figure in 2012. It opened an office in America in 2011, the\u000a      firm's biggest single market.\u000a    Zelfo&#174; : Zelfo is a materials system that\u000a      is based entirely on nanofibrillated cellulose fibres, where\u000a      fibres mechanically interlock and self-bind via hydrogen bonding. Hence,\u000a      no further additives or\u000a      resins are required to promote fibre bonding, resulting in a sustainable\u000a      and recyclable bio-based\u000a      alternative to ones using synthetic resin systems, such as wood fibre\u000a      plastic (WFP) or medium\u000a      density fibre board (MDF). Zelfo was initially developed and patented by\u000a      Zellform GmbH (Austria)\u000a      in the 1990s. However, it needed a collaborative R&amp;D program funded by\u000a      the DTI (REFLECT,\u000a      2007-2010), involving QMUL's Nanoforce, InterfaceFLOR, Omodo (the original\u000a      patent holders),\u000a      and other industrial partners to successfully industrialize the concept.\u000a      Within this collaborative\u000a      project, Peijs' his expertise in cellulose and nanocellulose [3-5], led to\u000a      optimized environmentally\u000a      friendly processing schemes for Zelfo panels. Minimizing energy and\u000a      resources (water\/fibre), up-\u000a      cycling of cellulose waste streams, and shrinkage of the material while\u000a      drying were issues that\u000a      were tackled. Significant environmental impact was achieved through the\u000a      successful development of a\u000a      number of mixed fibre products which utilised cellulose waste and recycled\u000a      paper. Dr. Luca Achilli, at\u000a      the time working at Nanoforce under the supervision of Peijs, moved in\u000a      2009 to InterfaceFLOR as\u000a      an Innovations Project Manager to further develop the product. In 2011 Zelfo Technology GmbH\u000a      was created to commercialise the technology, and with a view to accelerate\u000a      industry take up an IP\u000a      technology transfer to BASF (Germany) took place in 2013, while in the\u000a      same year Interface Inc., a\u000a      world leader in sustainability, also acquired a shareholding of the\u000a      company. In September 2012,\u000a      Zelfo Technology and House of Hemp (South Africa) formed a manufacturing\u000a      alliance to up-cycle\u000a      cellulose waste to produce binder-free, formaldehyde free, products for\u000a      the building industry in\u000a      South Africa. The plant will produce a range of products to serve the\u000a      building market. Zelfo has\u000a      been awarded a number of prestigious prizes. In February 2011, Zelfo\u000a      Technology won two\u000a      prestigious `Rushlight Awards' for environmentally responsible products.\u000a      In March 2011 Zelfo was\u000a      voted `Biomaterial of the year 2011' by the Nova Institute. In April 2012,\u000a      Niche Snowboards\u000a      (featuring Zelfo) was awarded the ISPO (leading sports business network in\u000a      Munich, Germany)\u000a      `Eco Snowsport Product of the year' for their freestyle snowboard models.\u000a    BiotexTM: Composites Evolution is a young SME\u000a      that since 2010 provides innovative, sustainable\u000a      materials to the composites industry. The current Biotex\u000a      range now being commercialised by\u000a      Composites Evolution are a direct result of materials developed through\u000a      the DTI project COMBINE\u000a      (2007-2010), together with project partners like Netcomposites, Springdale\u000a      Natural Products, John L\u000a      Brierley, Sam Weller and Sons, and Tilsatec. The Biotex family includes a\u000a      range of high-performance\u000a      natural reinforcement yarns, fabrics (woven and non-crimp) and\u000a      preconsolidated sheets suitable for\u000a      composite applications. Standard grades include pure jute and flax\u000a      fabrics, flax\/PP, and flax\/PLA\u000a      commingled fabrics. Compared to traditional natural fibre reinforced\u000a      plastics based on non-wovens\u000a      these materials provide improved performance, easy processing and weight\u000a      savings. They are suitable\u000a      for semi-structural and decorative applications in sectors such as\u000a      automotive, construction, marine,\u000a      sports and consumer goods. Biotex uses a unique Twistless Technology to\u000a      ensure a high degree of\u000a      fibre alignment, impregnation and performance, based on research insights\u000a      obtained by Peijs [4] in an\u000a      earlier EU FP5 TEXFLAX project (2001-2003). Within the COMBINE project\u000a      Peijs and team were\u000a      responsible for developing optimized yarn and composite processing\u000a      technologies and property\u000a      evaluation. The widespread use of these materials can have significant\u000a      environmental impact as these\u000a      materials can save weight, and are based on renewable resources. The\u000a      research had direct economic\u000a      impact as Composites Evolution currently employs five fulltime employees.\u000a      Its turnover in 2012 was\u000a      &#163;150,000 and has doubled annually since its start in 2010, and is\u000a      projected to sustain this growth for\u000a      the coming 4-5 years, with the company moving into a new building within\u000a      the next year. Automotive\u000a      parts based on Biotex are currently under evaluation by a whole range of\u000a      car manufacturers and have\u000a      been approved by Jaguar Land Rover for their next generation vehicles. The\u000a      material has been\u000a      successfully introduced in the sports and leisure market including\u000a      snowboards by Canadian producer\u000a      Magine, skis and canoes, often\u000a      for its superior vibrational damping characteristics.

Over the\u000a      years' research\u000a      activities at QMUL in the area of both structural and functional materials\u000a      have focused on\u000a      polymeric, ceramic and composite materials for a multitude of applications\u000a      including lightweighting,\u000a      healthcare, protection, sensors, and energy conversion and storage.\u000a    Queen Mary has a long history in polymer and composite research, and a\u000a      long and distinguished\u000a      track record working in the general areas of polymer and rubber physics,\u000a      composite processing,\u000a      failure prediction, as well as component design. In recent years a large\u000a      research activity has been\u000a      focused on nanocomposites (Peijs, Busfield, Bilotti), where a major effort\u000a      is around the processing\u000a      of multi-functional polymeric or elastomeric materials based on nanoclays\u000a      and carbon nanofillers\u000a      [1,2], with interesting mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical\u000a      properties. Besides\u000a      nanocomposites a significant research activity is in the area of polymer\u000a      nanofibres (Barber, Peijs).\u000a      Nanospider&#174; technology is used for the creation of electrospun\u000a      nanofibrous materials for a wide\u000a      variety of applications such as filtration, textiles, medical and\u000a      protection, with links to Dstl. Other\u000a      more distinct areas of research are those of micro- and nano-encapsulation\u000a      (Sukhorukov) and\u000a      photoembossing for micro- and nanopatterning (Bastiaansen).\u000a    The team has also extensive research expertise in the area on natural\u000a      fibres, cellulose and\u000a      nanocellulose (Peijs) to create fully biobased materials with interesting\u000a      mechanical and functional\u000a      properties [3]. MRI researchers (Peijs, Bilotti) have a strong track\u000a      record in the field of bio-\u000a      degradable and\/or bio-based polymers (e.g. PLA, PHB, PCL) and composites\u000a      [4]. More recently\u000a      the use of self-binding nanocellulose networks (from plants or through\u000a      bacterial fermentation), as a\u000a      method to make 100% cellulose-based binder-free materials has been\u000a      explored [5].\u000a    Ceramics have always been a major part of the materials research\u000a      portfolio at Queen Mary, and\u000a      interest in this field remains as strong as ever. Over recent years\u000a      ceramic research has broadened\u000a      to cover functional ceramics as well as the more traditional area of\u000a      structural ceramics. Research\u000a      has recently been focusing on nanostructured ceramics and thermoelectrics.\u000a      For the production of\u000a      these materials the team (Reece, Yan) has unique spark plasma sintering\u000a      (SPS) facilities at\u000a      Nanoforce that allow densification of nanoceramic powders to be achieved\u000a      with minimal grain\u000a      growth. The group is also involved in the development of conductive\u000a      ceramic nanocomposites\u000a      using carbon nanotubes or graphene as a conductive filler [6]. Here the\u000a      rapid sintering by SPS can\u000a      preserve the structure of such carbon nanostructures, opening up the\u000a      possibility to create multi-\u000a      functional ceramic materials with improved mechanical, electrical and\u000a      thermal properties.\u000a    The application and impact of the team's research was significantly\u000a      enhanced by the creation of\u000a      Nanoforce Technology Ltd. in 2005. Nanoforce was set up as a spin-out from\u000a      QMUL with &#163;3.1m of\u000a      funding from the DTI and the London Development Agency (LDA) through the\u000a      Micro- and Nano\u000a      Technology (MNT) competition and was created to bridge the gap between\u000a      academic and industry-\u000a      led research to enable the development of new materials or improvement of\u000a      commercial products\u000a      using MRI's knowledge-base. Nanoforce is an independent research and\u000a      knowledge centre and\u000a      the MRI's `Portal to Industry', with a focus on advanced materials\u000a      processing. It provides a service\u000a      that industry often fails to find within academia as its set up, using\u000a      full-time employed researchers,\u000a      allows academics to conduct applied research on industrial timescales\u000a      (months) rather than\u000a      academic timescales (years) through PGRs or PDRAs. This has proven to be\u000a      highly valuable to\u000a      industry. Moreover, it gives QMUL academics greater flexibility to conduct\u000a      R&amp;D projects (either\u000a      collaborative, bilateral, or confidential short term contracts) with\u000a      industry rather than through PhD\u000a      or Postdoc programmes.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43825","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    From 1994 - 1999, Loughborough University developed a series of prototype\u000a      acoustic deterrent devices named PICE-EX, PICE-97 and PICE-99, generating\u000a      an ultrasonic acoustic swept signal up to frequencies as high as 160 kHz.\u000a      Since 1999 this system was then later commercialized under the\u000a      AQUAmark100&#8482; trade name by the AQUAtec Group based on the underpinning\u000a      research outlined in section 2.\u000a    1) Influenced changes in government \/ EU policy\u000a    The on-going (since 2008) impact on international policy of the\u000a      underpinning research outlined in section 2 is seen in various amendments\u000a      \/ enforcements to European Commission legislation established in 2004 (EC,\u000a      2004) concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries [5.1].\u000a      This legislation included a requirement to use acoustic deterrents to\u000a      reduce fisheries by catch. This regulation was influenced by Loughborough\u000a      University's (LU) research in this area and the specifications for the\u000a      pingers to be used the AQUAmark product specifications. Mandatory use of\u000a      pingers with these specifications was also included at this time in the\u000a      national porpoise action plans of most of the EU countries and in the\u000a      action plans of ASCOBANS (Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans\u000a      of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas; www.ascobans.org).\u000a      An example of international implementation at this time can be seen in the\u000a      ASCOBANS \"The Swedish action plan\" ASCOBANS, Document AC11\/Doc. 15(P)\u000a      Harbour Porpoise Action Plan for Sweden. (ASCOBANS 2004) [5.2]. The\u000a      on-going impact of these regulation and subsequent international and\u000a      national implementations is evidenced below.\u000a    In 2010 as part of the Memorandum of Understanding, the European Union\u000a      requested the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to\u000a      review incidental catches of cetaceans in European waters and to advise on\u000a      the implementation of certain provisions of the earlier Council\u000a      Regulations (EC, 2004) No 812\/2004. These provisions continued to advise \"acoustic\u000a        deterrents using basic 10 kHz signals and more complex multi-signal\u000a      (such as the LU influenced AQUAmark100 product), be deployed on static\u000a        gear are effective in reducing by-catch of harbour porpoise\" (ICES,\u000a      2010) [5.3]. In 2013 data from Danish fisheries trials using\u000a      AQUAmark100 systems was published to suggest greater spacing of pingers\u000a      could be effective for implantation in Danish gillnet and hake fisheries\u000a      (Larsen et al., 2013) [5.4].\u000a    From 1st September 2013 the UK's Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has\u000a      announced its intent to enforce the implementation of the European\u000a      Commission No 812\/2004 regulations for specific UK fisheries. In this\u000a      statement all vessels measuring 12 metres or over using certain nets are\u000a      required to fit acoustic dissuasive devices, known as pingers to help\u000a      reduce cetacean by-catch (MMO, 2013) [5.5]. The Aquamark100 system\u000a      using LU influenced research is specifically listed in this document as a\u000a      regulation-compliant device.\u000a    2) Changed the worldwide debate around achieving reductions in\u000a        accidental by-catch by fisheries\u000a    There has been continued world-wide debate on the use of acoustic\u000a      deterrent systems for the reduction of by-catch (accidental capture of\u000a      marine mammals and others in fisheries). This debate has extended to use\u000a      of such systems to also prevent depredation (prevention of damage to\u000a      fisheries by marine mammals) (SFGEN, 2002) and extension to a wide range\u000a      of species including larger whales and sharks (Dawson et al.,\u000a      2013) using acoustic deterrent devices including the AQUAmark system [5.6].\u000a      In 2008 when Gazo et al, reported in trials in the Mediterranean\u000a      that nets equipped with AQUAmark pingers using Loughborough developed\u000a      algorithms received less predation damage (87% fewer holes) than nets with\u000a      non-functional devices or without pingers (Gazo et al, 2008) [5.7].\u000a      Reducing net damage is a commercial imperative for fisheries. Also in 2008\u000a      Brotons et al. reported a large scale study of an artisanal\u000a      gillnet fishery around the Balearic Islands using several pinger types\u000a      where \"the use of active pingers apparently discouraged dolphins from\u000a      interacting with nets, dramatically so in the case of the Aquatec\u000a      (AQUAmark100) pingers\" (Brotons et al., 2008) [5.8].\u000a    3) Contributed to commercial growth of UK business through sales of\u000a        the commercialized systems\u000a    The AQUAtec Group Ltd undertook to commercialise Loughborough\u000a      University's patented technology and have marketed it under the name\u000a      AQUAmark100&#8482;. They also have a series of additional products still using\u000a      Loughborough's original PICE developed signal suite as the foundation\u000a      technology. To date, AQUAtec have sold over 14,000 systems internationally\u000a      at an average unit cost of &#163;80 (Dawson et al., 2013) [5.6]\u000a      making it the market leader in Northern Europe and significantly reducing\u000a      by-catch in a wide variety of fisheries internationally. In 2007, the\u000a      World Wildlife Fund (WWF) awarded a `Special UK prize' to the Aquatec\u000a      Group Ltd for the AQUAmark systems and its work in by-catch reduction,\u000a      this reduction continues within the assessment period.

In 1970, the\u000a      International Whaling Commission reported large numbers of small cetaceans\u000a      (toothed whales, dolphins and porpoises) were killed in gillnet fisheries\u000a      each year. Despite being protected by a number of international\u000a      agreements, such as the Marine Mammal protection Act enacted in 1972 in\u000a      the USA and under ASCOBANS (Agreement on the Conservation of Small\u000a      Cetaceans in the Baltic and North Seas), a number of species were still\u000a      considered to be at considerable risk. The signatory governments to these\u000a      agreements are committed to reducing the incidental kill of harbour\u000a      porpoises. To meet legislative, environmental and political goals for the\u000a      reduction of by catch in commercial fishing significant technical\u000a      improvements to fishing methods are required. Loughborough University\u000a      responded to this challenge and developed a wide-ranging body of research\u000a      between 1994 and 2002 (outlined below) that has led directly to a\u000a      commercially viable solution [3.1, 3.5].

Following this work the Loughborough\u000a      group (led by these researchers) were major contributors to the European\u000a      Commission AIR-III Programme funded project \"Prevention of By-Catch of\u000a        Small Cetaceans in Pelagic Trawls by Technical Means (CETA-SEL)\"\u000a      project AIR3-CT94-2423 [3.2, 3.4].

This significant\u000a      annual showcase is a truly global event and attracts c.250 international\u000a      delegates from research, industry and governments (5.1).

Antrum trades successfully,\u000a      with several major clients such as ESA, Orange, BSkyB, Sarantel and Philex\u000a      and a consistently buoyant turnover of c. &#163;150K pa (5.2). Working\u000a      closely with WiCR, Antrum refines research outcomes into designs and\u000a      specialist devices for applications in aerospace and defence, smart\u000a      commercial and industrial communications, medical and automotive markets.\u000a    WiCR and Antrum have maintained a connection with Sarantel (5.3)\u000a      (designers of high-performance miniature antennas for portable wireless\u000a      applications) over several years. A significant project designed and\u000a      interrogated the functioning of a novel antenna for GPS applications\u000a      (research papers 3.1 - 3.3 above). Once the antenna's design and operation\u000a      was fully understood, the research developed innovative techniques to\u000a      control its manufacture. The collaborators developed the dielectric-loaded\u000a      quadrifilar helical antenna, which Sarantel markets as PowerHelix\u000a      technology. The research built-up an understanding of how the quadrifilar\u000a      helical antenna has little interaction with its close environment &#8212; a\u000a      highly desirable feature for mobile equipment antennas. PowerHelix\u000a      has a right-hand circular polarisation generating a cardioid-shaped\u000a      reception pattern above the antenna. The active part of the antenna is\u000a      isolated from the handset case and has a very small near-field region\u000a      making it less susceptible to close body proximity or other absorbing\u000a      material than conventional designs.\u000a    Much of the Sarantel research aimed to understand how complex devices,\u000a      such as these antennas, might be simulated using commercial software, as a\u000a      cost effective, practical option for both for research and industrial\u000a      applications (for example, see 5.4). This knowledge is retained\u000a      within WiCR and has informed subsequent research projects.\u000a    Significantly Sarantel were able to refine their manufacturing processes\u000a      and to produce six antenna variants targeted at a range of customers\u000a      worldwide. Sarantel gained a competitive advantage in the sector. The\u000a      technology is now utilised in the following:\u000a    \u000a      AutoSeis HDR1C autonomous seismic node.\u000a      Mobile solutions AG in a GPS telephone.\u000a      Algodue Elettronica in their Geopoint portable GPS tracker.\u000a      Tom Tom's Navigator 6 Bluetooth Receiver\u000a      Hewlett Packard's iPAQ rx5000 series travel companion\u000a      HyOn in their personal multimedia player\u000a      Locosys in several products\u000a      Benefon TWIG Discovery Smartphone\u000a      ST Electronics in their ruggedised PDAs\u000a      Hummingbird GPS fish finder from Johnson Outdoors (USA)\u000a    \u000a    In a competitive market, this enhanced product line was crucial to\u000a      Sarantel's success. The company expanded to Japan &#8212; exporting British\u000a      technology based on British research. They currently employ c. 43 people\u000a      and had a six-month turnover, as at 31\/03\/2011, of &#163;1.03m.\u000a    To give a second significant example of the transformation of research\u000a      into commercial reality, the potential of novel outdoor VHF antennas made\u000a      using metamaterials was explored in a PhD project (Nerijus Riauka, 2007 -\u000a      2010) which drew upon several areas of research (papers 3.4 - 3.6 above)\u000a      to arrive at `the Blade' novel antenna. Several innovative research steps\u000a      met the specific demands of digital TV which were posed by the industrial\u000a      collaborator Philex Ltd (UK) (5.5). The technology's potential was\u000a      recognised early and IP protection secured by Antrum with the University's\u000a      co-operation (UK Patent Application: 1212340.2, EC Design Registration:\u000a      2074567) (5.6). An EPSRC KTA award (2010-2011), allowed WiRC and\u000a      Antrum to develop the Blade further improving both its\u000a      functionality and aesthetic appeal. A license has been signed with Philex\u000a      and the Blade antenna is currently in production with advanced\u000a      negotiations nearing conclusion with major retailers both in the UK and US\u000a      (5.7).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes how spin-out company, Antrum Ltd (founded in\u000a      2001) realises the commercial potential of Loughborough University's\u000a      extensive antenna research.

Its labs, staff and facilities are important components of\u000a      the School of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering. The School\u000a      is internationally and nationally leading in communications engineering as\u000a      evidenced by external value assessments. Prof. Vardaxoglou (Professor at\u000a      LU from 1988 to date) leads the WiCR with key contributions from\u000a      researchers: Mr. Rob Seager (Lecturer at LU from 1982 to date), Dr.\u000a      Panagamuwa (Research Associate at LU 2004 to 2007, now Lecturer 2007 to\u000a      date) and Dr. Alford Chauraya (Research Associate at LU from 2003 to\u000a      date).\u000a    The WiCR researches topics applicable to innovative wireless\u000a      communications technology, focused primarily on antennas, microwave and\u000a      mm-wave engineering, and metamaterial structures though extending to all\u000a      modern communication systems and their supporting processes. With\u000a      innovation at its centre, the WiCR collaborates with several\u000a      internationally leading companies &#8212; Orange, British Aerospace, Marconi,\u000a      Sarantel, European Space Agency and world-leading universities &#8212; Ohio\u000a      State University, Michigan State University, Aalto University (Finland)\u000a      and the University of Sienna. WiCR's activities are characterised by\u000a      strong industrial collaboration with support from EPSRC and EU sponsors.\u000a      The team are supported by advanced test and measurement facilities\u000a      including a 15m x 5m x 5m tapered anechoic chamber optimised for\u000a      cylindrical near-field measurements from 400 MHz to 18GHz.\u000a    From the outset, WiCR's work was characterised by innovation and\u000a      sensitivity to commercial imperatives &#8212; improving the effectiveness,\u000a      aesthetics, and value for money of antennas. An early achievement, in\u000a      collaboration with Sarantel Ltd, was the development of low Specific\u000a      Absorption Rate (SAR) antennas as safer alternatives for mobile phone\u000a      users and GSM, GPS and SATCOMMS applications (see papers 3.1-3.3\u000a      below). WiCR is pioneering research in metamaterials in microstrip planar\u000a      high gain antennas for point-to-point links and cylindrical patch array\u000a      antennas for base-station applications. Enhancing the feeding sub-system\u000a      improves bandwidth capability and efficiency whilst reducing manufacturing\u000a      complexity. The work benefits from international collaboration on the\u000a      analysis and synthesis of electromagnetic metamaterials with specific\u000a      electric and magnetic properties. This includes applications of magnetic\u000a      metamaterials to the radiation performance of small antennas. It is the\u000a      foundation for many analysis methods used in the field and is published\u000a      widely. (see papers 3.4 -3.6 below)\u000a    WiCR have had research breakthroughs on novel planar metamaterials and\u000a      were the first to publish completely planar artificial magnetic conductor\u000a      surfaces that are simultaneously electromagnetic band gap structures for\u000a      surface wave suppression.\u000a    WiCR has designed a high-gain multiband horn antenna for point-to-point\u000a      links for a UK mobile phone service provider. Designed to reduce the\u000a      required number of radio link antennas on an antenna farm, they also\u000a      reduce costs and negative impact on the aesthetic environment.\u000a    The Group have numerical analysis and advanced corroborative model\u000a      results to demonstrate the advantages of introducing higher permeability\u000a      to dielectric materials to improve the radiative efficiency of small\u000a      antennas.

These\u000a      projects resulted in the development of new products. For example, under\u000a      the TSB SMARTLASER project (2009-2012) several new generations of pulsed\u000a      laser product were developed for product marking applications, enabling\u000a      more information to be put into smaller areas and at higher speeds.

Today, they\u000a      are widely used in telecommunications, manufacturing, medicine and\u000a      science. Their strengths lie in their stability, beam quality and the\u000a      facts that they can achieve very high levels of power and are far more\u000a      efficient than other lasers in their energy use. It has been the\u000a      continuing development of these qualities for practical use that has been\u000a      the focus of research led by Professor Alec Gambling, the founder director\u000a      of the Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC) from 1989 until his\u000a      retirement in 1995, Professor Sir David Payne, who became Director of the\u000a      Optoelectronics Research Centre in 1995, with Professors David Richardson\u000a      (1989-present, now ORC Deputy Director), Johan Nilsson (since 1996,\u000a      initially Research Fellow, now Professor) and other team members.\u000a    The research has comprised an extensive body of work on the development\u000a      of optical fibres and laser concepts that have allowed scaling in the\u000a      average output powers from practical fibre lasers from the ~1W regime in\u000a      1993, to the 10kW+ systems of today, as well as an extended range of\u000a      operating modes extending from short-pulse to high power single-frequency\u000a      operation.\u000a    ORC research between 1993 and 1997 related to the testing and\u000a      identification of the critical rare earth ion dopants (ytterbium, erbium\u000a      and thulium) and core glass compositions required to generate and reliably\u000a      sustain ultrahigh (more than 1kW continuous power) levels at near infrared\u000a      wavelengths (1.00-2.2 &#181;m) [3.1-3.3]. The limits to pulsed energy\u000a      extraction of these were examined and researchers developed large mode\u000a      area core designs capable of handling high power and high pulse energies\u000a      [3.4] ultimately providing access to the multi-kW class, high brightness\u000a      laser regime.\u000a    Practical all-fibre techniques were also developed to couple the required\u000a      pumping light derived from laser diodes into the fibre laser structure in\u000a      a scalable, robust and compact fashion. This was critical to the\u000a      development of the spin out company SPI Lasers Ltd and is referred to as\u000a      GT-Wave technology (US Patent 6826335, 2004).\u000a    In 2004, ORC researchers conducted the world's first demonstration of a\u000a      kW-class single mode fibre laser system, convincingly showing for the\u000a      first time that fibre lasers could compete favourably with existing laser\u000a      technology [3.5] and opening the doors to a host of new industrial and\u000a      defence applications.\u000a    Further work demonstrated and refined the Master Oscillator Power\u000a      Amplifier (MOPA) concept to allow high performance pulsed [3.4] and single\u000a      frequency systems [3.6], greatly extending the functionality, performance\u000a      and ultimate power scaling of fibre lasers.\u000a    Although the majority of the underpinning research was conducted under a\u000a      series of EPSRC research grants [3.7-3.9], the funding required to\u000a      demonstrate kW class operation was obtained through the US Defense\u000a      Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [3.10] who recognised the ORC's\u000a      pre-eminence in the field. Once the kW level was achieved, DARPA opted not\u000a      to fund further work at the ORC due to the strategic significance of the\u000a      result and launched large fibre laser programs in the US to bridge the\u000a      UK\/US technology gap.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43864","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Process: from research to impact\u000a    The invention of the MOF has led to a step-change in a range of\u000a      applications of fibre-optic technology, and created new business sectors\u000a      within the global optoelectronics industry which has adopted this new form\u000a      of fibre not only to improve or extend the performance of existing product\u000a      lines, but also to exploit its unique properties and develop revolutionary\u000a      new products and services. Several of these are already having\u000a      transformational impact across important application sectors. The biggest\u000a      impact so far is the use of MOF technology to create a revolutionary new\u000a      laser device, the Supercontinuum Fibre Laser (SFL), which\u000a      generates white light that can be &gt; 1 million times brighter than\u000a      possible by pre-existing technologies, and exploits the unique nonlinear\u000a      optical properties in MOFs [5.1].\u000a    1. Economic Impact (creation of new business sectors and adoption of\u000a        new technology)\u000a    Creation of a local spin-out: The invention of MOFs and subsequent\u000a      early research on nonlinear MOFs conducted at the ORC led to the creation\u000a      and continuing success of the spin-off company Fianium, which was\u000a      founded in 2003 by Professor Anatoly Grudinin, and is now one of the\u000a      world's leading suppliers of compact, all-fiberised supercontinuum\u000a      sources. During the period between 2008 and 2013 the company more than\u000a      doubled in size. It currently has an annual turnover of ~&#163;10million\u000a      and employs more than 50 people in the Southampton area, many of\u000a      which are post-doctoral researchers coming from the ORC. The growth has\u000a      earned the company two Queen's awards: for International Trade\u000a      (2009) and Innovation (2012) [5.1]. Fianium maintains strong links with\u000a      the ORC, where it funds research at the level of &#163;100k per annum, and\u000a      exports more than 90% of its products, thereby generating revenue and\u000a      profits for the UK [5.1].\u000a    Creation of a new business sector: Besides Fianium, several other\u000a      companies worldwide have been created to commercialise supercontinuum\u000a      sources: NKT Photonics (Denmark), Menlo Systems (Germany) and Toptica\u000a      Lasers (Germany). Furthermore, MOFs are also sold as a product in their\u000a      own right by companies such as OFS (Denmark, USA), Fujikura (Japan) and\u000a      Yangtze Optical Fibre Company (China). Most other major fibre\u000a      manufacturers (e.g. Corning, Furukawa) have established large MOF research\u000a      programs and capabilities, even though they do not currently openly\u000a      advertise MOF products. [5.2]. The estimated global market for MOF and\u000a        SFLs in 2011 was $96 million and this is predicted to rise to $621\u000a      million in 2016 [5.3].\u000a    2. Health impacts\u000a    The use of MOFs to generate compact supercontinuum lasers has enabled the\u000a      development of new biomedical instrumentation and diagnostics. With the\u000a      very recent commercial availability of SFL-enabled products, MOF\u000a      technology is now beginning to be used in laboratories and hospitals\u000a      across the world to enchance our understanding of biological systems and\u000a      to aid diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions for improving the\u000a      health and well-being of the general public, as illustrated in the\u000a      examples below:\u000a    In the area of biological imaging, these MOF-enabled broadband\u000a      laser sources have a multitude of applications, including the areas of\u000a      fluorescence lifetime imaging, flow cytometry, and in-vivo optical\u000a      molecular imaging. In broadband spectroscopy, high-resolution\u000a      optical coherence tomography and endoscopic illumination,\u000a      these devices are being applied across a range of important medical\u000a      applications. SFLs, using Fianium products, have been key to the\u000a      development of a technique developed by Stefan Hell from the Max Planck\u000a      Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G&#246;ttingen to push the resolution of\u000a      conventional microscopy beyond the conventional diffraction limit, thereby\u000a      achieving significantly sharper levels of detail in biological\u000a      imaging [5.5]. Scientific instrument manufacturers have started to\u000a      integrate supercontinuum sources in their products. In 2012 Japan-based\u000a      manufacturer of precision instruments HORIBA integrated the high intensity\u000a      and broad wavelength range of a supercontinuum laser into a commercial\u000a        spectrofluorometer for improved diagnostic capability [5.6]. In\u000a      2013, Leica Microsystems &#8212; a world leader in microscopy and imaging\u000a      solutions &#8212; began marketing products that use supercontinuum lasers as\u000a      \"the ultimate source for confocal microscopy\" [5.7]. Manufacturer\u000a      Bioptigen develops non-invasive ophthalmic imaging systems,\u000a      generating high-resolution images of the cornea and retina. Early in 2013\u000a      the company integrated a supercontinuum source into its products \"to\u000a      achieve a breakthrough in ophthalmic imaging for preclinical research\"\u000a      [5.8].\u000a    3. Impact on public and professional services\u000a    In the field of metrology, supercontinuum lasers based on the new MOF\u000a      technology have enabled ultrastable frequency combs that provide a direct\u000a      link between optical and microwave frequencies. This has made the\u000a      measurements of frequency, time and length far more accurate than hitherto\u000a      possible, with profound impact on both the fundamental science program and\u000a      commercial services, such as the distribution of accurate time\u000a      through an optical fibre network and time stamping services for financial\u000a      transactions, now offered by the National Physics Laboratory (NPL) [5.4]\u000a      and other such standards labs worldwide. This is an important contributor\u000a      to global international trade and world stock-markets.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research has led to the creation of new business sectors in\u000a      laser development for medical and healthcare applications, which has\u000a      enabled the creation of a world-wide market worth US$96 million in 2011,\u000a      and a local spin-out, Fianium Ltd, which now has more than 50 employees\u000a      and an annual turnover of around &#163;10 million.

The work has\u000a      spawned a whole new field of research with &gt; 8,200 journal papers\u000a      written to date on the topic (source: Web of Science, September 2013), all\u000a      of which have resulted from the first MOF work at Southampton [3.2].\u000a    Nature of the research insights or findings which relate to the impact\u000a        or benefit claimed:\u000a    \u000a      First numerical demonstration of the possibility to obtain bandgap\u000a        guidance in hollow core MOFs representing a fundamentally new means to\u000a        guide light in an optical fibre [3.1] (1995);\u000a      The first demonstration of a light guiding MOF [3.2] (1995-1996);\u000a      The development of the first numerical method capable of modelling\u000a        MOFs, which highlighted their exceptional dispersive and nonlinear\u000a        properties [3.3] (1999);\u000a      First measurement of the high nonlinearity of small core MOFs, which\u000a        generated enormous interest in these fibres and ultimately paved the way\u000a        to the realisation of modern all-fibre based supercontinuum sources\u000a        [3.4] (1999);\u000a      First demonstration of supercontinuum generation using a short pulse\u000a        Ytterbium doped fibre laser with a suitably designed PCF, the\u000a        configuration currently exploited by commercial supercontinuum vendors,\u000a        such as Fianium Ltd.

The research has been responsible for the creation and\u000d\u000a      expansion of new business activities within two established multinational\u000d\u000a      corporations, Philips and Sharp Corporation, evidenced by substantial\u000d\u000a      investment and new product developments. This has led to the creation of\u000d\u000a      entirely new portable diagnostic and monitoring systems, which are\u000d\u000a      improving the quality of life of patients and will reduce the cost of\u000d\u000a      healthcare.\u000d\u000a    Economic Impacts: Creation of a new business activity within Philips\u000d\u000a    Southampton's pioneering research led to an industrial collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Philips in 2006. The encouraging results highlighted the commercial\u000d\u000a      potential for the microfluidic technologies and lab-on-a-chip to provide\u000d\u000a      low-cost high volume solutions for consumer diagnostics. In 2009, as a\u000d\u000a      direct consequence of their collaboration with Southampton, Philips\u000d\u000a      established a new Biomedical Diagnostics unit at their Cambridge-based\u000d\u000a      research facilities. The lab-on-a-chip technology is now a core part of\u000d\u000a      Philips Home Care Solutions long term strategy and Philips' annual\u000d\u000a      research and development spend in the area around this technology has\u000d\u000a      grown to approximately &#163;5m [5.1]. This unit now employs 12 full-time\u000d\u000a      employees (including one Southampton PhD graduate, Dr Catia Bernabini, who\u000d\u000a      worked for two years in this unit) who collaborate with Southampton in a\u000d\u000a      range of healthcare focused research and development.\u000d\u000a    Among the tools developed at Southampton with Philips, of particular note\u000d\u000a      is the microfluidic technology for full blood counting. Philips have\u000d\u000a      commercialised the technology and developed a product for the home\u000d\u000a      monitoring of chemotherapy. This product allows the early diagnosis of\u000d\u000a      neutropenia (loss of white blood cells) through analysis of a finger-prick\u000d\u000a      blood sample and sends the results back to the healthcare provider [5.2,\u000d\u000a      5.3]. The product will be launched commercially in Europe in 2014. A\u000d\u000a      second portable palm-sized device is also being developed into a Philips\u000d\u000a      product. The \"chemoinformer\" allows patients undergoing chemotherapy to\u000d\u000a      remotely upload data which is then communicated to their nurse on a daily\u000d\u000a      basis. The chemoinformer is being trialled by 18 patients undergoing\u000d\u000a      chemotherapy treatment for small cell lung cancer at Southampton General\u000d\u000a      Hospital. The trial is managed by Dr Christian Ottensmeier [5.4] and is\u000d\u000a      due to finish at the end of 2013.\u000d\u000a    The importance of the technology and the collaboration with Southampton\u000d\u000a      is evidenced by &#163;250,000 direct industrial research funding from Philips\u000d\u000a      since 2008. In addition, Philips provided &#163;730,355 financial support for\u000d\u000a      the EPSRC\/TSB Technologies for Health project \"Point of Care Blood Cell\u000d\u000a      Analysis\" (TS\/G001405\/1). The collaboration has led to 5 publications with\u000d\u000a      Philips researchers as co-authors. The IP from a world patent\u000d\u000a      (WO\/2010\/140127) [5.5] was transferred to Philips at a cost of &#163;12,000\u000d\u000a      plus royalties and 2 further patents have been filed.\u000d\u000a    Economic Impacts: Creation of a new business activity within the Sharp\u000d\u000a        Corporation\u000d\u000a    Southampton's ground breaking research in electrowetting for fluid\u000d\u000a      control has led to a similar impact on the business activities of the\u000d\u000a      Sharp Corporation. Sharp have collaborated with Southampton to jointly\u000d\u000a      develop a miniature electronic fluid-handling platform now being\u000d\u000a      commercialised for use in bioassays and immunoassays for the rapid\u000d\u000a      analysis of viral and bacterial infections. The collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Southampton led in 2009 to the creation of Sharp's `Health and Energy'\u000d\u000a      group at its research labs in Oxford. Following Southampton's successful\u000d\u000a      demonstration of bioassays (3.6), this group expanded from six full-time\u000d\u000a      employees (2012) to 10.5 (2013). Since the start of this collaboration,\u000d\u000a      Sharp's annual research and development spend in this technology has grown\u000d\u000a      to approximately &#163;1.47m with plans to double this to &#163;3m by the end of\u000d\u000a      2014 [5.6]. A further proposal has been submitted to the board of Sharp\u000d\u000a      Corporation for a total investment of &#8364;27m over 6 years for product\u000d\u000a      development and launch. This is a rapidly progressing impact case and the\u000d\u000a      importance of this new business activity to Sharp and the significance of\u000d\u000a      the collaboration with Southampton is evidenced by the numerous on-going\u000d\u000a      joint projects. Morgan was recently awarded a Royal Society Industry\u000d\u000a      Fellowship to work with Sharp Labs Europe from January 2013 to 2017. The\u000d\u000a      collaboration has led to one patent filed with Southampton inventors\u000d\u000a      [5.7].\u000d\u000a    Health Impacts\u000d\u000a    The medical technology developed has enhanced the quality of life of\u000d\u000a      patients. The Philips home monitor improves quality of life for cancer\u000d\u000a      patients (particularly the terminally ill) by improving the timing of\u000d\u000a      treatment and providing an early diagnosis of potential complications\u000d\u000a      without the patient leaving their home. Worldwide 9 million people live\u000d\u000a      with cancer and half of them will receive chemotherapy; approximately half\u000d\u000a      of these suffer some degree of neutropenia. Unfortunately, up to 70% of\u000d\u000a      those infected require hospitalisation, and over 40% suffer delay to their\u000d\u000a      chemotherapy. These patients are vulnerable to serious infections that can\u000d\u000a      lead to overwhelming sepsis and death; the morbidity rate from septic\u000d\u000a      neutropenia is up to 10%. Early detection of neutropenia can therefore\u000d\u000a      avoid patient readmission, improve outcome and significantly reduce the\u000d\u000a      cost of healthcare.\u000d\u000a    Southampton research is also improving the quality of life in developing\u000d\u000a      countries. The technology has been disseminated to medical professionals\u000d\u000a      through events such as the Glycomic Centre's 'Kenya Workshop' (June 25-29,\u000d\u000a      2012), a conference workshop aimed at Sub-Saharan healthcare\u000d\u000a      practitioners. Morgan oversaw hands-on sessions and visited local health\u000d\u000a      clinics to demonstrate how to use Southampton-developed low-cost\u000d\u000a      diagnostics. Feedback from Thomas Kariuki, Director of the Institute of\u000d\u000a      Primate Research (a Nairobi biomedical facility) testified to the value of\u000d\u000a      the technology: \"Through quality diagnosis, public health effort to reduce\u000d\u000a      disease impacts on Kenyans' lives can be realised, as illness means paying\u000d\u000a      for treatment and lost earnings, which impacts on the entire economy.\"\u000d\u000a      [5.8]\u000d\u000a    Impact on Society and Culture\u000d\u000a    Such is the pioneering nature of the lab-on-a-chip technology that the\u000d\u000a      Southampton research has regularly received international news and media\u000d\u000a      attention since 2009.

A 2012 report by the\u000d\u000a      King's Fund showed that reducing the number of overnight stays for over\u000d\u000a      65's by 2.3 million per year, would allow &#163;462m a year to be reinvested in\u000d\u000a      community and primary care services. However, mechanisms are required that\u000d\u000a      would allow patient care at home, while providing clinicians access to\u000d\u000a      appropriate data and patients with personally relevant and reassuring\u000d\u000a      information about their treatment and condition. Research in Southampton\u000d\u000a      into micro scale systems for fluid handling (known as microfluidic\u000d\u000a      systems) began in 2004, when Prof Morgan was appointed. His fundamental\u000d\u000a      research in microfluidics and techniques for manipulating and analysing\u000d\u000a      particles (electrokinetics) was translated into technologies for\u000d\u000a      miniaturised diagnostic systems. The systems integrate multiple analytical\u000d\u000a      methods, with micro-fluidic technologies and data analysis onto a single\u000d\u000a      platform, termed the Lab-on-a-Chip.\u000d\u000a    Morgan's early research (grants 1-3) catalysed the development of new\u000d\u000a      miniaturised non-invasive single-cell analysis platforms. Underpinning\u000d\u000a      research included improved understanding of the electrokinetic properties\u000d\u000a      of particles [3.1, 3.2] and the development of new fabrication\u000d\u000a      technologies, integrated cell handling and analysis methods with\u000d\u000a      electronics and signal processing methods [3.3] to enable spectral\u000d\u000a      analysis of single cells in very short time windows. This involved flowing\u000d\u000a      up to 1000 cells per second through a specially designed micro-impedance\u000d\u000a      system.\u000d\u000a    Capitalising on this work, Southampton worked with Philips (grant 4) to\u000d\u000a      develop a miniature diagnostic system for analysis of cells from small\u000d\u000a      drops (50uL) of blood - the Full Blood Count (FBC). This project focused\u000d\u000a      on the discrimination of the different blood cell types by passing cells\u000d\u000a      through the detection zone of a pair of micro-electrodes, from which the\u000d\u000a      information on cell size and dielectric properties was gathered. This\u000d\u000a      project marked a breakthrough in combining high-speed impedance analysis\u000d\u000a      of cells with innovative microfluidic sample processing [3.4, 3.5],\u000d\u000a      complex electronics and high speed signal processing. Close collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Southampton University Hospital allowed testing on patients. The\u000d\u000a      project also developed a patient-centred information gathering and\u000d\u000a      processing platform implemented on a palm-sized computer &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      \"Chemoinformer\". This symptom-based diagnostic system allows patients\u000d\u000a      undergoing chemotherapy to upload data on daily basis, which is then\u000d\u000a      communicated to the district nurse.\u000d\u000a    In 2005 Morgan explored electrowetting for fluid control (grant 5).\u000d\u000a      Devices were designed and manufactured to allow trapping and processing of\u000d\u000a      cells using dielectrophoresis in simple, open geometries for generic\u000d\u000a      lab-on-a-chip architectures. Researchers also developed a generic method\u000d\u000a      for combining surface-based electromechanically-mediated microfluidics\u000d\u000a      with \"traditional\" dielectrophoresis-based cell manipulation. Electric\u000d\u000a      field dispensing and mixing systems were used to disperse and characterise\u000d\u000a      particles such as cells. Researchers showed that it is possible to\u000d\u000a      initiate and control chemical reactions and biological protocols with such\u000d\u000a      a system. This overcame a major bottleneck in miniature diagnostics: the\u000d\u000a      manipulation of nano-litres of liquid under direct electronic control.\u000d\u000a      Southampton then partnered with Sharp Labs Europe (SLE) to build on this\u000d\u000a      early work to develop a complex miniature electronic fluid-handling\u000d\u000a      platform, based on Active Matrix Thin Film Transistor methods,\u000d\u000a      manufactured by Sharp in Japan [3.6]. Since January 2013, Southampton and\u000d\u000a      Sharp have collaborated with Public Health England (PHE), part of the\u000d\u000a      Department of Health, to develop new bioassays for the platform and\u000d\u000a      develop an analytical system for rapid analysis of viral and bacterial\u000d\u000a      infections (grant 6).\u000d\u000a    Other key researchers\u000d\u000a    Nicolas Green (Reader, appointed UoS in 2006); Donna Davies (Professor,\u000d\u000a      School of Medicine); Peter Howarth (Reader, Southampton University\u000d\u000a      Hospital); Judith Holloway (Lecturer, School of Medicine, appointed 2007).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43866","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research into energy harvesting at Southampton has spearheaded the\u000d\u000a      development of a multi-million-pound\u000d\u000a      industry and enabled the large-scale deployment of wireless sensors in\u000d\u000a      industry and\u000d\u000a      the rail network. Further impacts include the development of international\u000d\u000a      standards, influencing\u000d\u000a      the decisions of funding bodies and raising the profile of energy\u000d\u000a      harvesting among industry and the\u000d\u000a      wider public.\u000d\u000a    The research was commercialised in 2004 following the launch of spin-out\u000d\u000a      company Perpetuum\u000d\u000a      Ltd [5.1] and has since attracted &#163;9.6m in venture capital.

The\u000d\u000a      founding academics\u000d\u000a      continue to work closely with Perpetuum in several areas, including a\u000d\u000a      joint TSB funded project to\u000d\u000a      investigate long-term reliable energy storage [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Economic Impacts\u000d\u000a    Perpetuum's energy harvesting technology has been adopted by the rail and\u000d\u000a      petrochemical\u000d\u000a      industries where the systems they enable have led to improved business\u000d\u000a      performance through\u000d\u000a      reduced costs, increased efficiency and safety.\u000d\u000a    Rail Applications: Perpetuum's energy harvesting technology\u000d\u000a      has been adopted by the rail\u000d\u000a      industry where it has enabled for the first time the real time\u000d\u000a      monitoring of bearings on rolling\u000d\u000a      stock. The system is a maintenance free, retrofittable solution that\u000d\u000a        has revolutionised\u000d\u000a        bearing condition monitoring on trains. Before this, bearings could\u000d\u000a      only be inspected during\u000d\u000a      infrequent manual maintenance checks, which was inadequate, time consuming\u000d\u000a      and expensive.\u000d\u000a      Perpetuum's wireless sensor system is powered by a vibration energy\u000d\u000a      harvester designed to\u000d\u000a      work with the high amplitude, low-frequency vibrations found in rail\u000d\u000a      applications. Perpetuum's\u000d\u000a      sensor nodes monitor individual bearing health and the data is collected\u000d\u000a      centrally on the train\u000d\u000a      and transmitted via GSM to a data centre. A simple summary of fleet\u000d\u000a      condition is available live\u000d\u000a      on the web, with alerts being sent via email or SMS. The system has been\u000d\u000a      developed in\u000d\u000a      partnership with the train manufacturer (Bombardier) and train operator\u000d\u000a      (Southeastern). The\u000d\u000a        system has been recently exported and has been deployed on 200 trains in\u000d\u000a        the UK and\u000d\u000a        Sweden (SJ AB) [5.1, 5.3]. The system is currently being modified to\u000d\u000a      also detect `out of round'\u000d\u000a      wheels (e.g. flat spots) which, if not fixed, can cause excessive impacts\u000d\u000a      on the rails damaging\u000d\u000a      the network and even leading to derailment [5.4]. In summary,\u000d\u000a        Perpetuum's energy\u000d\u000a        harvesters have enabled wireless condition monitoring that are\u000d\u000a        transforming condition\u000d\u000a        monitoring in the rail industry leading to improved rail safety and\u000d\u000a        reduced maintenance\u000d\u000a        costs. The cost savings equate to a payback on each installation of\u000d\u000a      less than one year and the\u000d\u000a      lifetime of the system is 25 years [5.1].\u000d\u000a    Industrial Applications: Wireless condition monitoring is\u000d\u000a      also transforming condition\u000d\u000a      monitoring of machinery in industry that, until recently, was typically\u000d\u000a      performed periodically by\u000d\u000a      an engineer using handheld equipment. Energy harvesting enables the\u000d\u000a        condition\u000d\u000a        monitoring sensors to be powered by the very vibrations they are\u000d\u000a        monitoring.\u000d\u000a      Perpetuum's generators are the only approved energy harvesters\u000d\u000a      that can be used with\u000d\u000a      General Electric's Essential InsightTM Wireless Condition\u000d\u000a      Monitoring product range [5.5]. GE\u000d\u000a      Bentley Nevada is the world's leading supplier of wireless condition\u000d\u000a      monitoring equipment to the\u000d\u000a      oil\/gas and power generation industries. Perpetuum's generators are\u000d\u000a        fully ATEX-certified for\u000d\u000a        use in hazardous explosive environments, and the wireless systems\u000d\u000a      they enable can be\u000d\u000a      found in condition monitoring equipment across North America and Europe.\u000d\u000a      For example, in\u000d\u000a      2008 Perpetuum's generators were deployed in Shell's Ormen Lange gas field\u000d\u000a      in Norway, with\u000d\u000a      Shell reporting that the self-powered wireless technology has made the\u000d\u000a        utilisation of\u000d\u000a        resources more efficient, reduced the severity of mechanical failures,\u000d\u000a        lowered\u000d\u000a        installation costs and provided more frequent and higher-quality data\u000d\u000a      [5.6]. Perpetuum's\u000d\u000a      vibration-powered generator is also the only harvester offered by other\u000d\u000a      wireless sensor network\u000d\u000a      manufacturers such as Emerson and National Instruments in their platforms\u000d\u000a      for industrial\u000d\u000a      process measurement, control and condition monitoring applications [5.7,\u000d\u000a      5.8].\u000d\u000a    Impact on Public Policy and Society\u000d\u000a    Southampton's research and influence has raised the profile of energy\u000d\u000a      harvesting and impacted on\u000d\u000a      policy debates relating to research funding calls. Beeby is leading the\u000d\u000a      UK's Energy Harvesting\u000d\u000a      Network, a &#163;112k initiative to connect academia with industrial end-users\u000d\u000a      (list available in [5.9]). As\u000d\u000a      part of the network's activity, three workshops have been held focused on\u000d\u000a      particular application\u000d\u000a      areas (human, built environment and MEMS implementations). Each workshop\u000d\u000a      was attended by\u000d\u000a      industry (including Philips, Rolls Royce, Smith and Nephew, TRW Conekt and\u000d\u000a      NPL) and has led to\u000d\u000a      the publication of a roadmap of the research challenges and future uses of\u000d\u000a      energy harvesting\u000d\u000a      technology. These roadmaps were circulated and discussed with funding\u000d\u000a      agencies and the\u000d\u000a      momentum generated by the Network led to a further workshop, Energy\u000d\u000a        Harvesting Technology &#8212; Creating\u000d\u000a        a New Industry in the UK, organised by the Technology Strategy Board\u000d\u000a      (TSB) in\u000d\u000a      September 2011. Following this, the TSB opened an Energy Harvesting themed\u000d\u000a      competition in\u000d\u000a      October 2012 with a budget of &#163;1.25m [5.10].\u000d\u000a    The TSB also fund the Energy Harvesting Special Interest Group (EH-SIG).\u000d\u000a      Prof. Beeby and Roy\u000d\u000a      Freeland (Perpetuum President) [5.1] are members of the steering board\u000d\u000a      which advises the EH-SIG\u000d\u000a      on its activities which include, for example, trade missions to Germany,\u000d\u000a      Japan and USA\u000d\u000a      promoting UK energy harvesting companies, products and expertise. Further\u000d\u000a      engagement with\u000d\u000a      industry came through the three Energy Harvesting profile-raising events\u000d\u000a      in London organised by\u000d\u000a      Prof. Beeby through the Network, which have attracted over 90 attendees\u000d\u000a      from industry (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Cosworth, Morgan Electro Ceramics, Meggit PLC). Feedback from the\u000d\u000a      industrialists (gathered via\u000d\u000a      feedback forms) was very positive, with 84% rating the events as good or\u000d\u000a      excellent.

Given its\u000d\u000a      applicability to the security field, the work led by Mark Nixon, Professor\u000d\u000a      in Computer Vision (at Southampton since 1983) and John Carter, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer (at Southampton since 1985) was initially funded for US$1.3\u000d\u000a      million by the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,\u000d\u000a      under its Human ID at a Distance program [3.1] between 1999 and 2002.\u000d\u000a      Further funding came from the Ministry of Defence [3.2] the US Army\u000d\u000a      Research Laboratory [3.3] and the European Union, enabling the creation of\u000d\u000a      extensive multimodal databases containing large gait image-datasets. So\u000d\u000a      far, this research has involved 29 PhD students and 10 RAs at Southampton.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research required new techniques in computer vision to\u000d\u000a      enable the automated understanding of walking motion in video sequences\u000d\u000a      [3.4]. Nixon and Carter developed the first model-based approach (the\u000d\u000a      first research paper internationally to mention gait as a biometric [3.5])\u000d\u000a      and some of the first model-free approaches. Carter led the development of\u000d\u000a      the world's first 3D biometric tunnel (funded by the MoD [3.2]) a\u000d\u000a      constrained environment designed with public places such as airports and\u000d\u000a      shopping centres in mind. Equipped with eight synchronised cameras, the\u000d\u000a      team collected a variety of non-contact biometrics, capturing gait from\u000d\u000a      different angles as a subject walked through the tunnel. One gait database\u000d\u000a      featured images of more than 100 subjects and has around 300 registered\u000d\u000a      users from over 30 countries.\u000d\u000a    Carter and Nixon developed the first intrinsically viewpoint-invariant\u000d\u000a      approach [3.6] relying on a single camera without calibration, and worked\u000d\u000a      with a wide range of camera views making it ideal for covert surveillance\u000d\u000a      use. Nixon and Dr Sasan Mahmoodi (at Southampton since 2008) were the\u000d\u000a      first to demonstrate time invariance in gait [3.7] disproving earlier\u000d\u000a      understanding that gait changes over time. In collaboration with Dr Sarah\u000d\u000a      Stevenage, Lecturer in Psychology (at Southampton since 1993) the team\u000d\u000a      developed the first video-based analysis of people's ability to recognise\u000d\u000a      others by gait [3.8]. They were the first to translate gait biometrics to\u000d\u000a      forensics use [3.9] (thereby rendering gait biometrics compliant with\u000d\u000a      Daubert rules and the recent Law Commission proposals, for use by expert\u000d\u000a      witnesses) and to study spoofing of vision-based gait biometrics\u000d\u000a      (demonstrating ability to withstand attempts to fool the system by\u000d\u000a      mimicking another person's gait).\u000d\u000a    Nixon has delivered a host of keynote speeches at top international\u000d\u000a      academic conferences, from IEEE Face and Gesture FG04 (South Korea, 2004)\u000d\u000a      through IEEE Biometrics Theory and Applications BTAS (Washington, 2009) to\u000d\u000a      IEEE Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance AVSS (Krakow, 2013).\u000d\u000a      Nixon co-authored the first textbook on gait biometrics Human ID by\u000d\u000a        Gait and co-edited a special edition on gait in IEEE\u000d\u000a        Transactions SMC (B) 40(4) 2010, a top journal of its type.\u000d\u000a      As a direct result of Southampton's research, `gait biometrics' first\u000d\u000a      appeared as a conference session at one of the top international\u000d\u000a      conferences in biometrics in 2003 and now features as a keyword in leading\u000d\u000a      annual biometrics conferences. Nixon co-organised the first session on\u000d\u000a      Biometrics and Forensics at the 2010 European Signal Processing\u000d\u000a        Conference and co-chaired the first International Workshop on\u000d\u000a        Biometrics and Forensics in Lisbon 2013.\u000d\u000a    Southampton's work is responsible for a new research arena. The extension\u000d\u000a      of gait into the new field of soft biometrics, initiated in joint work\u000d\u000a      with the US Army, bridges psychology and computer vision, recognising\u000d\u000a      people by incorporating human evidence in the processing chain. These\u000d\u000a      biometrics techniques are leading to new methods for attribute generation\u000d\u000a      and recognition as in the new EPSRC Superidentity project, led by\u000d\u000a      Stevenage, that encompasses aspects that we reveal both in the real world\u000d\u000a      and in the cyber world [5.11]. Gait and soft biometrics were the subject\u000d\u000a      of Nixon's plenary at the 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced\u000a        Video and Signal-Based Surveillance 2013 &#8212; the top international\u000d\u000a      forum for disseminating new research in surveillance technologies [5.13],\u000d\u000a      and of interest in forensic science [5.14].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43868","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Linking Research to Impact\u000a    The impact delivered in this case study has been generated through the\u000a      following mechanisms:\u000a    (i) A sustained programme of engagement with key beneficiaries\u000a      has led to relationship development. Evidence of the success of\u000a      this is provided by our long-standing Framework Agreement with National\u000a      Grid (NG); we are one of just four UK universities to benefit from a\u000a      strategic alliance with this major engineering organisation. The value of\u000a      this is based upon a process whereby dialogue helps to address NG's\u000a      existing issues, while also informing us of future challenges. The cable\u000a      ratings element of this impact case study shows how sustained engagement\u000a      with system operators (NG and EDF Energy Networks &#8212; now UK Power Networks)\u000a      highlighted shortcomings with established procedures and, subsequently,\u000a      led to novel solutions.\u000a    (ii) The dielectrics element of this impact case study provides evidence\u000a      of our agile approach to opportunity. This began as a PhD project\u000a      with NG, which subsequently developed through EPSRC and TSB projects. The\u000a      latter involved NG and also benefitted from Dr Simon Sutton [5.1] moving\u000a      from NG to Dow Chemicals, which enabled us, then, to access this\u000a      multinational polymer supplier. Subsequently, by exploiting other relationships\u000a        developed with leading cable manufacturers (e.g. ABB and General\u000a      Cables [5.2]) we have generated follow-through in terms of\u000a      acceptance of our technology.\u000a    Much of the above research has been reliant upon the Ofgem's Innovation\u000a      Funding Initiative, a requirement of which is that it can \"enhance the\u000a      technical development of distribution networks and can embrace asset\u000a      management from design through to construction, commissioning, operation,\u000a      maintenance and decommissioning\" [5.3].\u000a    Impacts during the REF Period\u000a    1. Economic Impact on Business\u000a    The application of finite element tools to cable ratings problems,\u000a      coupled with experimental validation, has led to improved techniques that\u000a      greatly enhanced accuracy, thereby improving the performance of\u000a      electricity network businesses through the minimisation of both risk and\u000a      constraint costs, while maximising asset utilisation. NG has made savings\u000a      of &#163;1.2m per annum as a result of employing improved cable ratings\u000a      methodologies [5.4]. Potential future losses have been mitigated by\u000a      improved methods of risk assessment for critical plant. Translating our\u000a      knowledge across to the offshore wind sector has informed future design\u000a      choices on wind farm export cables at Centrica Renewable Energy Ltd [5.5].\u000a      Shifts in expenditure profiles within corporate budgets are evinced by the\u000a      substantial and sustained industrial funding into novel dielectric systems\u000a      won within the REF period: SUSCABLE project (NG, Dow Chemicals), &#163;467k\u000a      (total value including EPSRC\/TSB contribution &#163;659k) (2008-2010);\u000a      Polymeric Materials Development for high voltage direct current Cable\u000a      Applications projects (ABB Switzerland), total value &#163;305k (2011-2013);\u000a      SUSCABLE II project (Nexans, Silec, Scottish Power, ORE-Catapult): total\u000a      value &#163;480k (2013-2016) [5.1, 5.2].\u000a    2. Environmental Impact\u000a    Improved modelling of ventilated tunnels is having a traceable impact on\u000a      particular projects in terms of reduced environmental impact &#8212; reductions\u000a      in cooling system running using our new control scheme has been estimated\u000a      to deliver electricity cost savings of around 60% [5.4]. Our development\u000a      of high performance thermoplastic cable dielectrics is affecting\u000a      international cable manufacturers and polymer suppliers; the technologies\u000a      we have developed are less energy intensive in production, are fully\u000a      recyclable at end of life and have been shown to offer network businesses\u000a      enhanced operational flexibility by allowing greater power transfer\u000a      capabilities than existing products [5.6].\u000a    3. Knowledge Transfer &amp; Increased Business Capability\u000a    Documented changes in the knowledge and capability of NG have occurred as\u000a      evinced by their adoption of methods we developed. Specifically, NG now\u000a      have enhanced thermal modelling capability within the business, with the\u000a      methods developed under [G2] now part of their standard circuit rating\u000a      tool. We have also partnered with members of the NG supply chain, for\u000a      example Balfour Beatty Utility Solutions Limited (BBUSL) requested a build\u000a      of the cable tunnel modelling software for their engineers. This broadens\u000a      the impact beyond the UK, with BBUSL using the tools in their design work\u000a      for other countries [5.7]. We have also been invited to attend design\u000a      meetings to provide additional design verification services where our new\u000a      methods can provide solutions for problems which the present international\u000a      standards cannot. Our novel dielectric materials have been patented in\u000a      conjunction with our industry partners &#8212; WO 2012\/044523A1 and US\u000a      provisional patent application 61\/617,347 (subsequently granted as\u000a      WO\/2013\/148028).\u000a    4. Change in Business Practice\u000a    We have developed a track record for implementation of our research work\u000a      within companies such as National Grid. The methods developed in [3.2] for\u000a      modelling water cooled cable circuits and [3.3] for cable tunnels have\u000a      been used to evaluate required levels of refurbishment on cable circuits\u000a      in London, allowing the necessity of capital expenditure to be challenged\u000a      in a more robust way than previously possible. Our tools permitted Balfour\u000a      Beatty Utility Solutions Limited (BBUSL) to engage in a more detailed\u000a      thermal analysis of cable circuits under refurbishment than had ever been\u000a      achieved before, influencing the design processes used and reducing system\u000a      risk [5.7].\u000a    5. Impact on Practitioners\u000a    Industrial acceptance of radical technological change can be difficult to\u000a      achieve, especially where reliability and long deployment times breed\u000a      conservative approaches.

To meet this challenge, it is imperative that we must\u000a      maximise the ability of our electrical networks to transmit power reliably\u000a      from generators to load centres. This need was emphasised in, for example,\u000a      the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper and the 2012 UK's Energy\u000a        Security Strategy document. Our research responds to this by\u000a      addressing two key questions relating to cable systems:\u000a    \u000a      How much power can reliably be conveyed through any given cable link\u000a        and for how long?\u000a      How can cables be redesigned to increase their transmission\u000a        capability?\u000a    \u000a    This impact case study addresses both of these questions in a concerted\u000a      way.\u000a    Underpinning work at Southampton has informed international standards for\u000a      rating cables since the 1970's, many of which are still in use today.\u000a      However, increasing awareness of the limitation of these approaches led UK\u000a      network operators to fund a range of projects at Southampton to enhance\u000a      their understanding of key issues and hence increase network capabilities\u000a      [G1-G3]. Key advances have involved the development of advanced finite\u000a      element models, supported by bespoke experimental facilities for\u000a      validation. Work led by Prof Paul Lewin in 2005, developed numerical\u000a      models for buried cable systems that coupled the physics of heat flow and\u000a      moisture transport. Advances in computing hardware have facilitated the\u000a      creation of bespoke 2D finite element models of buried cable systems [3.1]\u000a      eventually leading to the creation by Dr James Pilgrim (initially PhD\u000a      student, now Lecturer) of full 3D models of cooled joint bays from\u000a      critical London cable circuits in 2008 [3.2]. Driven by the trend for the\u000a      greater use of cable tunnels in London, new methods were created for\u000a      rating ventilated tunnels [3.3] and cables mounted in surface level\u000a      concrete troughs [3.4] using combined thermal analysis and fluid dynamics\u000a      (2008-2012).\u000a    An alternative approach to the problem of cable ratings is to re-design\u000a      the cable to allow enhanced power transmission. Research into the\u000a      electrical and mechanical behaviour of bespoke polyethylene blends began\u000a      in the mid-1990s and demonstrated that material systems could be designed\u000a      with significantly enhanced characteristics through carefully controlling\u000a      the molecular composition of the system, such that the required\u000a      microstructures self-assembled. The extension of this concept to high\u000a      temperature insulation systems based on polypropylene was led by Prof Alun\u000a      Vaughan, beginning in 2006 within the Engineering and Physical Sciences\u000a      Research Council (EPSRC) Amperes Supergen programme [G3] and demonstrated\u000a      its viability within the laboratory [3.5]. However, the use of isothermal\u000a      processing conditions rendered direct technology transfer to industry\u000a      impractical. Further follow-on funding from the Technology Strategy Board,\u000a      EPSRC and a consortium of industrial partners in 2008 [G4] then developed\u000a      a technologically practical non- isothermal manufacturing process [3.6].\u000a      Together with large scale system studies and cable rating analysis, the\u000a      work demonstrated the value to system operators of cable systems capable\u000a      of operating at higher temperatures, with current ratings increased by up\u000a      to 28%. On-going work is extending this concept to high voltage DC cables,\u000a      with further support from ABB (Switzerland) [G5] and EPSRC [G6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43869","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The process of Research leading to Impact\u000a    Research into the use of fibre-based interferometry to locate faults and\u000a      disturbances led directly to the formation of a technology start-up\u000a      company, Sensoptics, in 2006. It was co-founded by Dr Stuart Russell, who\u000a      developed most of the technology during his PhD. Having generated\u000a      commercial interest, the company developed both the existing and new\u000a      sensing approaches before successfully launching several perimeter\u000a      monitoring products for improved applications in security, and\u000a      subsequently diversifying into the oil and gas industry. In 2011\u000a      Sensoptics was sold to QinetiQ, an international defence and security\u000a      technology company, for &#163;2.6m [5.1], with further benefits to be paid\u000a      pending commercial success. The company was later rebranded as OptaSense\u000a      [5.2]. In a 2011 press release from QinetiQ, Managing director Mike\u000a      O'Connor described the technology as `an excellent addition to QinetiQ's\u000a      portfolio of sensor solutions, ... equally applicable to detecting\u000a      intruders in perimeter security applications as it is to monitoring\u000a      mechanical failure in critical underwater infrastructure' [5.3]. Later in\u000a      2011, OptaSense signed a &#163;26.5m deal with Shell to monitor the hydraulic\u000a      fracturing process (fracking) [5.3]. The company has grown rapidly; in\u000a      2008 it had just three employees, today it has &gt; 120. The firm\u000a      forecasts a turnover of &#163;100m by the middle of the decade and currently\u000a      exports to more than 35 countries [5.4]. This sequence of company\u000a      acquisitions (Sensoptics to Qinetiq to Optasense) in which a business has\u000a        adopted a new technology is a clear indicator of economic impact.\u000a    Economic and Environmental Impact\u000a    The beneficiaries of these huge commercial advantages lie across a wide\u000a      range of sectors including civil engineering companies (due\u000a      to improved structural monitoring); manufacturing companies\u000a      (due to better process monitoring and improved safety within chemical\u000a      plants); and the security and defence industries (where\u000a      intrusion monitoring is paramount). However the greatest beneficiary is the\u000a        energy industry, where greater extraction efficiency and improved\u000a      monitoring and reservoir management bring vast financial and environmental\u000a      benefits. It is to be noted that the worldwide optical sensors market is\u000a      estimated at $2 billion [5.5, 5.6]. Further impact is evidenced through job\u000a        creation: the three companies listed in the summary now employ over\u000a      160 people in this area of distributed optical fibre sensing.\u000a    The lead partner in the FOSAR DEEP project [3.8] &#8212; Stingray Geophysical &#8212;\u000a      a leader in the use of fibre-optic sensing technology for seismic\u000a      Permanent Reservoir Monitoring solutions, have reported that\u000a      cost-effective permanent reservoir monitoring enables oil companies to\u000a      extract more hydrocarbons from known reservoirs more quickly, more safely\u000a      and more cost-effectively: a 2-3% increase in recovered hydrocarbon is\u000a      worth in excess of &#163;1 billion on a typical reservoir [5.7]. This is clear\u000a      indication of the impact on the management of natural resources\u000a        (energy) and the introduction of new processes for economic\u000a      benefit.\u000a    In 2010, following the experimental demonstration of acoustic sensing\u000a      over a distance of 500km, with the required system sensitivity, ORC\u000a      researcher Dr Ed Austin was recruited by Stingray Geophysical. The\u000a      development of this deep-water sensing capability was fundamental in the\u000a      subsequent US$45 million sale of Stingray to the Norwegian company TGS in\u000a      2011. A press release at the time stated: `The transaction will provide\u000a      TGS with a strong position in the rapidly growing market for Permanent\u000a      Reservoir Monitoring solutions.' Robert Hobbs, CEO of TGS, added: `The age\u000a      of \"easy to find\" oil is over, forcing oil companies to increase\u000a      investment in their existing fields to extend production and increase\u000a      recovery factors. The acquisition of Stingray allows TGS to access a\u000a      larger portion of the reservoir optimization market.' [5.8], which is a\u000a      clear indication of both economic and environmental impact.\u000a    Following ORC research that successfully demonstrated record long-reach,\u000a      high-resolution temperature and strain measurements, Sensa Schlumberger\u000a      developed a robust demonstrator suitable for field trials for both power\u000a      cable monitoring with National Grid Transco and oil and gas pipe lines for\u000a      BP Explorations. After further development work Sensa Schlumberger\u000a      launched their Pipeline Condition Monitoring System, which was\u000a      field-tested at two sites in April 2007 [5.9]. From 2008 onward the\u000a      company has found applications for the system in long-distance subsea\u000a      energy cable monitoring, installing six high-value projects to date. In\u000a      early 2013 Schlumberger began work on a major project involving 450km of\u000a      pipeline. Schlumberger Fellow Dr Arthur Hartog said: `We think the\u000a      technology can radically alter borehole seismic acquisition in particular\u000a      by making it much more efficient [and] financially more attractive.'\u000a      [5.10].\u000a    Finally, at the time of submission of this case study, negotiations\u000a      concerning a major deployment opportunity in Brazil (estimated value\u000a      US$100m and enabled by the improved business capability developed in FOSAR\u000a      Deep) are currently at an advanced stage [5.7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research into distributed optical fibre sensing undertaken at the\u000a      Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC) at the University of Southampton has\u000a      had profound economic and environmental impact within the oil and gas\u000a      industries in both extraction efficiency from existing reservoirs and\u000a      improved safety performance and operation of three companies: Optasense,\u000a        Stingray Geophysical and Schlumberger.

It is applied to a wide range\u000a      of sectors including defence, security and civil engineering, but most\u000a      significantly to the oil and gas industry. Conventional electronic-based\u000a      reservoir monitoring schemes have limitations: they require complex\u000a      wiring, are prone to failure and only allow the integration of a limited\u000a      number of sensors. Furthermore, as oil becomes harder to find, today's\u000a      reservoirs are further offshore and at greater depths, leading to an\u000a      increased need for more reliable ways of transmitting sensor signals over\u000a      longer distances and in deeper seas.\u000a    By developing a variety of optical fibre sensors, which have allowed\u000a      accurate measurement of acoustic fields, temperature and strain\u000a      distributions along fibre lengths of 100km and greater, researchers at\u000a      Southampton have made a significant and commercially viable contribution\u000a      to the field. The International Energy Agency estimates that permanent\u000a      reservoir monitoring can enhance oil recovery, contributing more than 20\u000a      million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030 (equivalent to US$2 billion). This\u000a      is significant in light of estimates by the US Energy Information\u000a      Administration that worldwide oil demand will increase from 83 million bpd\u000a      to 118 million bpd in 2030.\u000a    The main body of work on developing acoustic sensing technology took\u000a      place at the Optoelectronics Research Centre from 1999 to 2012. The\u000a      research team was originally led by Professor John Dakin who joined\u000a      Southampton in 1990 and became an Emeritus Professor in 2007, and more\u000a      recently by Professor David Richardson, who joined Southampton in 1989 and\u000a      is now Deputy Director of the ORC. Also in the team were Dr Stuart\u000a      Russell, (PhD student 2000- 2005, founder of spin-out company Sensoptics);\u000a      Dr Trevor Newson (Lecturer from 1990-2000, Senior Lecturer from 2000 to\u000a      present); Dr Ed Austin (Research Fellow 2003-2009); and Dr Shaiful Alam,\u000a      (Research Fellow from 2008, now Principal Research Fellow 2013 to\u000a      present).\u000a    With research grants totalling &#163;204,800 from US company Radio Detection\u000a      [3.7], who were interested in developing new techniques to locate and\u000a      protect buried telecom fibres, the team developed new techniques for\u000a      accurately locating disturbances (induced by strain\/acoustic\/RF- signals)\u000a      along a length of installed fibre using various forms of fibre-based\u000a      interferometry [3.1-3.3]. Their findings proved that optical fibres could\u000a      be remotely located and probed with high spatial resolution and high\u000a      sensitivity &#8212; a development that led directly to the formation of start-up\u000a      company Sensoptics. A further project, [3.8], undertaken between 2008 and\u000a      2012, demonstrated that multiple interferometric acoustic sensors could be\u000a      interrogated with high sensitivity over distances of over 500km. This was\u000a      achieved by exploiting suitably adapted wavelength and time domain\u000a      multiplexing in conjunction with the optical amplifier and\u000a      transmission-line technology used in optical telecoms [3.4].\u000a    Work between 1994 and 2005 led to the development of new Optical Time\u000a      Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) based techniques based on Brillouin scattering\u000a      [3.5]. The ORC team found that by launching a short pulse of light down\u000a      the fibre and measuring the backscattered light, they could accurately\u000a      determine temperature and strain distributions over distances of up to\u000a      50km achieving world-leading spatial resolution and low cross-sensitivity.\u000a      Between 2003 and 2006, ORC researchers developed new techniques, based on\u000a      optical amplification, to extend the reach of OTDR-based sensing from 50\u000a      to 150km [3.6]. In effect, the technique converts the entire length of\u000a      fibre into a sensor, allowing continuous measurements over longer\u000a      distances. This greatly extends the range of technological applications,\u000a      in particular the lucrative area of pipeline monitoring [3.9, 3.10].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43870","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact for our Bragg grating technology spans several related areas,\u000d\u000a      which reflect the intrinsic characteristics of fibre (FBG) and planar\u000d\u000a      (PBG) geometries. Impact here relate to Economic (spin-out,\u000a        creation of new business and adoption of new processes) as well as Environmental\u000d\u000a      (achievement of environmental (green) objectives).\u000d\u000a    FBG research has been directed at a wide range of technologies,\u000d\u000a      but the focus here is for NIF, the National Ignition Facility, in\u000d\u000a      Livermore, California, U.S.A. This is a massive enterprise aimed at fusion\u000d\u000a      research, (which is hoped will replace current fission-based power\u000d\u000a      stations) and which has at its heart, ORC-developed passive and active\u000d\u000a      fibre Bragg grating technology.\u000d\u000a    The FBG process that led from research to impact was via the ORC\u000d\u000a      involvement from an early stage of the developments of NIF, and concerned\u000d\u000a      the contributed key technology and knowhow that was developed through FBG\u000d\u000a      and optical amplifier designs. The 192 laser beams in NIF originate from a\u000d\u000a      single 5cm long DFB fibre-grating-laser master-oscillator conceived as a\u000d\u000a      concept and first demonstrated at the ORC. The critical\u000d\u000a      requirement is that this laser operates at the precise wavelength required\u000d\u000a      for all downstream laser and amplifier components [5.1, 5.2], and was\u000d\u000a      chosen because of its exceptional wavelength and power-stability. Precise\u000d\u000a      pulse control in the preamplifiers and the signal delivery fibres within\u000d\u000a      NIF is done with 30cm long ORC-fabricated passive chirped FBGs. The\u000d\u000a      critical operational requirements (long length, exact matching of passive\u000d\u000a      dispersion-orders and low phase-noise) can only be achieved with\u000d\u000a      ORC-fabricated gratings as there are no commercial suppliers or any other\u000d\u000a      research organisations that are capable of delivering these requirements.\u000d\u000a      It was this unique capability that led to NIF scientists\u000d\u000a      collaborating directly with the ORC [5.3].\u000d\u000a    The nature of the impact is the possibility that fusion-based\u000d\u000a      energy generation can provide that unlimited source of clean energy that\u000d\u000a      would solve one of our most fundamental problems. Fusion has been termed\u000d\u000a      the 'holy grail' and `game-changer' of future energy technology, and it\u000d\u000a      has vast potential to help meet the world's future energy challenges. The\u000d\u000a      success and promising concepts demonstrated at NIF are already spilling\u000d\u000a      over into beneficiaries in Europe, China and Russia where several\u000d\u000a      facilities are under construction creating new jobs in the industry, and\u000d\u000a      promoting high-tech laser-development [5.4]. While it is recognised that\u000d\u000a      there are many challenges remaining to be solved, it is undeniable that\u000d\u000a      cheap and renewable energy is perhaps number one on the wish-list of every\u000d\u000a      government. The world is closely following the fusion energy programme,\u000d\u000a      which, should it prove successful, would solve one of the most fundamental\u000d\u000a      problems of energy security. It is a testament to its\u000d\u000a      significance that grating-technology researched and developed at the ORC\u000d\u000a      lies at the very heart of the quest for controlled fusion, and that a\u000d\u000a      significant step towards this goal was reached on 5-July 2012 by NIF\u000d\u000a      reaching its 1.8MJ, 500TW milestone [5.5], and on 13-August 2013 when, for\u000d\u000a      the first time ever from any fusion facility in the world, the amount of\u000d\u000a      energy released through the fusion reaction exceeded the amount of energy\u000d\u000a      being absorbed by the fusion fuel [5.6].\u000d\u000a    The PBG process started from 1999, when Bragg gratings in planar\u000d\u000a      geometries were developed, together with the first proof of concept for\u000d\u000a      sensors. Prompted by feedback from industry, the University of Southampton\u000d\u000a      patented the inventions (e.g. US Patent No. 7,440,653, filed May-2003,\u000d\u000a      issued October-2008) and attracted VC-funding to establish the spin-out\u000d\u000a      Stratophase, which initially had two core technologies, UV-written Bragg\u000d\u000a      gratings and periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN). The second of\u000d\u000a      these was itself spun out in 2009 in another company, Covesion, which is\u000d\u000a      the subject of a different case study. Soon after the first VC-funding,\u000d\u000a      two patents were filed on evanescent field sensors utilising the original\u000d\u000a      grating patent (US Patent No. 7,715,005, filed July-2005, issued May-2010,\u000d\u000a      US Patent No. 7,541,573, filed July-2005, issued June-2009).\u000d\u000a    The nature of the impact and beneficiaries: Stratophase has led to\u000d\u000a      high-tech employment (presently 12 staff), investment by US\u000d\u000a      Investors of &#163;6.8m, and cumulative sales and development contracts worth\u000d\u000a      &#163;3.2m [5.7].

This laser-based\u000d\u000a      technology provides\u000d\u000a      brighter, clearer colours and uses less energy than conventional light\u000d\u000a      bulb-based units, and\u000d\u000a      therefore represents an activity that has an impact on the environment\u000d\u000a      also (management of\u000d\u000a        energy).

In 1994, Southampton\u000d\u000a      published a key result using a\u000d\u000a      novel approach which involved periodic structuring using liquid electrodes\u000d\u000a      [3.1] which produced the\u000d\u000a      small periods required with excellent fidelity, a result that followed\u000d\u000a      soon after the first reports from\u000d\u000a      Sony in 1993 and from Stanford University in 1994. Research followed into\u000d\u000a      the use of light to\u000d\u000a      control periodic poling [3.2, G1, G3] and fundamental work on structures\u000d\u000a      within periodically poled\u000d\u000a      materials was undertaken via collaborative research [3.3] to further\u000d\u000a      refine all aspects of the final\u000d\u000a      material precision and quality.\u000d\u000a    Progress in the underpinning research extended to the use of periodically\u000d\u000a      poled materials for\u000d\u000a      efficient wavelength conversion into the blue (short wavelength), where\u000d\u000a      450mW of blue light was\u000d\u000a      generated [3.4] and near-infrared (long wavelength) operation [3.5, G2] as\u000d\u000a      well as the adoption of\u000d\u000a      optical waveguide technology which was developed in conjunction with\u000d\u000a      periodic poling [3.6] all of\u000d\u000a      which presented further opportunities to expand the range of future\u000d\u000a      products. In particular, one of\u000d\u000a      the ORC's important contributions to the technology lay in developing a\u000d\u000a      simple process for periodic\u000d\u000a      poling of magnesium oxide doped crystals, which allows them to be used in\u000d\u000a      high-power\u000d\u000a      applications and at higher temperatures.

The economic impact comes with environmental\u000a      impact as profitability for UK forest industries means more forest\u000a      planting, substitution of non-renewable construction materials and reduced\u000a      timber miles.\u000a    Primary beneficiaries and routes to impact\u000a    The primary beneficiaries are UK timber growers and sawmillers. The\u000a      research has been directed by their needs from the establishment of SIRT\u000a      in 2003. An industry sponsor board meets quarterly to discuss the research\u000a      work and the network has conferences for sponsors (at least annually) and\u000a      industry generally (also at least annually) for knowledge transfer and set\u000a      the research agenda to real industry problems. Sponsor organisations\u000a      include the largest UK sawmilling and forestry companies as well as the\u000a      Confederation of Forest Industries. Projects have, to varying degrees,\u000a      been co-funded by industry, in many cases, involving industry providing\u000a      substantial in-kind support through donation of material, facilities and\u000a      staff time for discussion; the primary route for knowledge transfer and\u000a      impact. Knowledge transfer also takes place though events for specific\u000a      projects (at least annually) and industry magazines.\u000a    Economic and policy impacts\u000a    It is not possible to provide a precise value of impact because timber\u000a      markets are sensitive to international exchange rates and trends in the\u000a      construction sector meaning that the economic differential between graded\u000a      timber and rejects (which go to other markets) is volatile. Production\u000a      costs are commercially sensitive, but in 2010, during the construction\u000a      recession, it was estimated by industry that the cost of 1% reject\u000a      (construction timber sawmilling across the UK) was approximately\u000a      &#163;300-500k. A figure of &#163;400k per percent rejects has been used for the\u000a      following value assessments.\u000a    The project underpinned development of settings for the latest generation\u000a      of X-ray and acoustic grading machines, which has enabled UK (and Irish)\u000a      sawmills to use these machines. These settings have resulted in reduced\u000a      reject rates for British spruce. These settings were approved for\u000a      industrial use by the CEN (European Standards) committee in Spring 2011\u000a      and used data collected in the preceding 18 months.

It is too early to\u000a      estimate worth, but this is already challenging the misconception (held by\u000a      sawmills, merchants and end users) that UK timber cannot achieve such\u000a      grades &#8212; improving perception as a construction material [from F1].\u000a    Dan Ridley-Ellis is now playing an active role in timber grading\u000a      committees at UK (since 2009) and CEN level (since 2011), improving\u000a      standards and representing the interests of the UK. The value of this lies\u000a      in preventing problems in standards impacting on UK sawmilling which could\u000a      easily cost millions of pounds per year. For example, arguing against a\u000a      mandatory adjustment on measured stiffness (in standard EN384) (that was\u000a      shown, thanks to research undertaken, not to work) has saved future\u000a      grading settings moving from the currently low proportion of machine\u000a      rejects (~2%) up to an unviable 20-30% [from F2].\u000a    Grading standards work and underpinning research has also allowed the\u000a      University to provide confidence for UK sawmillers in the grading\u000a      technology they are currently investing in, and advise on how it can be\u000a      best used (2009-current). \"This should have significant financial\u000a        impact in the long-term\" (Named Timber Consultant #1) [from F1,\u000a        F2, F5, F6].\u000a    UK tree breeding programmes have refocused to include stiffness (~2011).\u000a      The impact is to prevent a future increase in rejects (estimated 3-10% or\u000a      &#163;1-4m\/year) [F1, F2, F3 and employing F4, F5\u000a\u0009  and F6] The research also allowed advising of policy\u000a      makers (via Forestry Commission) on future species planting following\u000a      recent outbreaks of tree diseases.\u000a    UK industry now using acoustic tools for log segregation and processing\u000a      decisions.

Conifers account for half of the UK woodland, of\u000a      which half is Sitka spruce, the main commercial species (72% of which is\u000a      in Scotland). Softwood accounts for ~95% of timber harvested, of which 1\/3\u000a      goes to construction markets. However, the UK imports ~60% of the\u000a      (&#163;1.3billion value) sawn softwood it consumes and the construction\u000a      industry (notably timber frame house building) has used mostly imported\u000a      timber. The aim of the research in this case study has been to improve the\u000a      profitability of UK forestry and sawmilling by increasing the use of UK\u000a      timber in construction by improving the quality of graded timber and\u000a      reducing wastage in the value chain.\u000a    The Strategic Intergraded Research in Timber (SIRT) network is a\u000a      collaboration between Edinburgh Napier University (sawn timber level), The\u000a      University of Glasgow (wood anatomy level) and Forest Research (tree\u000a      level) which has been running since 2003 &#8212; initially with funding from the\u000a      Scottish Funding Council and later with funding (at Napier) from industry,\u000a      Forestry Commission, Scottish Enterprise, Scottish Forestry Trust, and the\u000a      European Regional Development Fund. Impact (priority for these funders)\u000a      was built into the research from the outset.\u000a    This case study is for the research undertaken at Edinburgh Napier\u000a      University (by full time research staff) into the quality of UK-grown\u000a      timber for construction &#8212; principally Sitka spruce but also Douglas-fir\u000a      and larch (currently extending into other species). The research covers\u000a      the extent of between-forest, between-tree, within-tree and within-timber\u000a      variation of wood properties and links those properties to tree growth,\u000a      silviculture and processing decisions in order that the suitability of UK\u000a      timber for construction can be improved in the short term (via processing\u000a      and segregation) and the longer term (through silviculture and tree\u000a      breeding). The research involved bending tests, non-destructive testing,\u000a      tree measurement and statistical modelling. The key findings of the\u000a      research that produced impact are:\u000a    F1) That UK-grown spruce is limited in strength grading by\u000a      stiffness, rather than strength or density (as previously believed), with\u000a      statistical distributions of properties quantified and correlated with\u000a      commonly used grading indicators.\u000a    F2) That small changes in the resource stiffness would have a\u000a      major impact on future machine grading settings (and production yield),\u000a      and that current European Standards for strength grading exacerbate this\u000a      unnecessarily (in the way characteristic values are calculated from test\u000a      data).\u000a    F3) The realisation that tree breeding programmes need to consider\u000a      stiffness (in addition to existing focus on improved stem form, growth and\u000a      density) with some evidence of selection having reduced stiffness.\u000a    F4) That within-tree and within-forest variation exceeds\u000a      between-UK-forest variation, with influence of spacing, latitude, and tree\u000a      age quantified.\u000a    F5) That the juvenile core wood currently governs quality of\u000a      structural timber due, largely, to high microfibril angle (orientation of\u000a      cellulose crystals with the wood cell wall) which results in low stiffness\u000a      and drying distortion.\u000a    F6) Understanding of the application of acoustic tools for quality\u000a      assessment of trees and logs, and their limitations has been improved\u000a      (previously it was believed these tools do not work for UK spruce due to\u000a      its knottiness).\u000a    F7) That it is not possible to segregate logs to reduce drying\u000a      distortion of sawn timber, but that cutting patterns could be used to\u000a      reduce distortion\u000a    Key researchers (Napier):\u000a    Dan Ridley-Ellis, Principal Research Fellow (April 2003 - present)\u000a    Stefan Lehneke, Research Technician (April 2006 - present)\u000a    John Moore, Principal Research Fellow (January 2006 - February 2011)\u000a    Paul McLean, Senior Research Fellow (November 2011 - June 2013)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43935","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Economic Impact:\u000a    As indicated in the summary, CardioDigital Ltd, was spun out from the\u000a      University in 2001 to commercialise the research and has now become a\u000a      world leader in the development and supply of signal analysis solutions\u000a      for the medical device industry. The Company, which is led by Professor\u000a      Addison as CEO, is located at the Roslin Biocentre, one of the UK's\u000a      leading commercial centres for life science research.\u000a    Professor Addison also runs the Covidien R&amp;D facility based at the\u000a      Technopole Science Centre in Edinburgh, where over the past five years he\u000a      has developed this facility creating high value PhD level jobs. Close\u000a      links are maintained with Covidien in Boulder, Colorado where the\u000a      respiratory and monitoring solutions division is headquartered. Covidien\u000a      is a global medical device manufacturer with an annual turnover of $12B, a\u000a      presence in over 150 countries and a workforce of 44,000 worldwide and, as\u000a      such, has the global reach and commercial muscle to maximise the impact of\u000a      the acquired technologies. The investment by Covidien in Scotland is seen\u000a      as a significant economic impact.\u000a    CardioDigital Inc., a subsidiary of CardioDigital Ltd, was set up to\u000a      commercialise the technologies in the large US market and was the point of\u000a      sale for the Covidien deal in 2008. The technologies sold to Covidien at\u000a      that time included methods for determining respiration rate and blood\u000a      pressure from a pulse oximeter signal. Professor Addison became an\u000a      employee of Covidien at the time of the sale. Since 2008, Edinburgh Napier\u000a      University, as a key shareholder in the company, has benefited from a\u000a      series of dividends resulting from that sale.These payments have been\u000a      triggered by the meeting of milestones agreed between Covidien and\u000a      CardioDigital as part of the sale agreement.\u000a    Health Impact:\u000a    The technology has been applied to defibrillation techniques to improve\u000a      survival rates following sudden cardiac arrest, with a range of closely\u000a      linked pulse oximetry based technologies applicable for general ward use.\u000a      The technologies provide both enhanced and extended performance of the\u000a      pulse oximeter leading to improved patient care and hospital workflows.\u000a    Continuous monitoring of respiration rate is especially important for\u000a      adult patients receiving medication for post-operative pain management,\u000a      who are at increased risk for respiratory complications. New conclusions\u000a      and recommendations from the US Anaesthesia Patient Safety Foundation\u000a      (APSF) suggest continuous electronic monitoring of oxygenation and\u000a      ventilation for these patients to reduce the risk of unrecognised,\u000a      clinically significant respiratory complications.\u000a    The Chief Medical Officer of Respiratory and Monitoring Solutions at\u000a      Covidien stated, 28 Nov 2011, \"Despite its clinical importance, current\u000a      methods of respiration rate monitoring are not always adequate. The\u000a      addition of Respiration Rate to the Covidien Nellcor Respiratory Function\u000a      portfolio provides a more holistic monitoring solution using a single,\u000a      integrated sensor. Instead of merely knowing a patient's blood oxygen\u000a      levels, we can now look at aspects of ventilation, or the passing of air\u000a      into and out of the body. This gives healthcare professionals a more\u000a      complete picture of a patient's respiratory status, so they can provide\u000a      effective treatment and maintain patient safety.\"\u000a    In 2011 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted 510(k)\u000a      clearance to Covidien to market the Nellcor&#8482; Respiration Rate\u000a      Version 1.0 software and the Adult Respiratory Sensor. In the same year\u000a      the respiratory monitoring platform obtained a CE Mark to allow it to\u000a      market it throughout the European Economic Area. Market release of the\u000a      product commenced in 2012.\u000a    In 2011, Professor Addison gained an Early Stage Innovator Award from\u000a      Covidien and won Inventor of the Year award in 2012 for Covidien R&amp;D\u000a      projects.\u000a    Professor Addison, as inventor, has been granted over 30 US patents and a\u000a      further 90 patents have been applied for. All but three of these have been\u000a      written in the past 5 years whilst at Covidien. All concern novel methods\u000a      for biomedical devices. The majority concern signal processing in a wide\u000a      variety of medical signals.

The results indicated that low oscillation complex\u000a      wavelets were optimal in highlighting anomalies within structural\u000a      elements. In addition, new signal de-noising methods were developed\u000a      specifically for the sonic echo traces based on wavelet modulus maxima\u000a      techniques.\u000a    The wavelet transform's unique ability to decouple non-stationary,\u000a      aperiodic signal components also made it ideal for developing enhanced\u000a      signal processing algorithms for medical devices. Prof Addison and his\u000a      team demonstrated that the wavelet transform could extract extremely\u000a      subtle physiological information, `unseen' by traditional temporal or\u000a      Fourier methods ref 1.The results were brought to the\u000a      attention of a Norwegian company Laerdal Medical, a specialist\u000a      manufacturer of resuscitation equipment. Funding was provided for a pilot\u000a      study to establish whether the de-noising software could be applied to ECG\u000a      signals recorded during ventricular fibrillation which hitherto was\u000a      thought to represent disorganized and unstructured electrical activity of\u000a      the heart. The research developed a new signal analysis technique which\u000a      revealed previously unreported structure within the ECG tracing. These\u000a      findings provided the first evidence linking this structure to unexpected\u000a      mechanical phenomena occurring in the heart ref 2,3. A patent\u000a      GB9910019 was filed on the 1st May 1999 and a company\u000a      CardioDigital Ltd was spun out from the University in 2001 to\u000a      commercialise the research findings.\u000a    A parallel stage of research commenced in collaboration with a US\u000a      company, Nellcor Puritan Bennett, which specialised in pulse\u000a      oximetry monitoring. This resulted in a novel time-frequency method for\u000a      the measurement of oxygen saturation using the signals from a standard\u000a      pulse oximeter machine. The method utilised the time-frequency\u000a      transformation of these red and infrared signals to derive a novel 3D\u000a      Lissajous figure. By selecting the optimal Lissajous, the method provided\u000a      an inherently robust basis for the determination of oxygen saturation as\u000a      regions of the time-frequency plane where high and low frequency signal\u000a      artefacts are to be found were automatically avoided. A patent GB200115284\u000a      was filed on the 22nd June 2001 and the findings published in\u000a      2004 ref 4. Under the guidance of Professor Addison,\u000a      co-founder and CEO, the company acquired a suite of adjacent blood\u000a      pressure technologies from Canadian company, VSM Medtech, in 2007. During\u000a      the same year CardioDigital Inc., a US subsidiary of CardioDigital Ltd,\u000a      was incorporated in Portland, Oregon.

The need for independent\u000a      verification became paramount to avoid systematic errors.

A previously insurmountable challenge was to\u000a      avoid rolling edges down (crucial as rolled edges on segments lead to\u000a      stray light in the telescope, reducing contrast of key science\u000a      objectives). The key insight (Walker) proved to be tuning variable\u000a      spot-sizes always to give a turned-up edge, starting broad, then\u000a      narrowed and finally removed at the very last step.

This led to a new family of more\u000a      aggressive \"grolishing\" processes, to smooth-out defects in pre-ground\u000a      surfaces, and so accelerate subsequent polishing. Since 2009 these have\u000a      been refined by Yu and PhD students in a programme of experimental trials\u000a      at Optic.

The emphasis of current research is to develop processes for\u000d\u000a      the modification of hydrocolloids to meet specific industrial\u000d\u000a      requirements.\u000d\u000a    Gum Arabic (Acacia senegal) is the most widely used emulsifier in\u000d\u000a      beverage emulsion but suffers from natural built-in variation which can be\u000d\u000a      influenced by many factors such as location, climate and age of the tree.\u000d\u000a    A key paper (Paper 1, 1993) giving an insight on the\u000d\u000a      structure function relationship of gum arabic was produced by Williams\u000d\u000a      (Director of the University's Centre for Water Soluble Polymers) and\u000d\u000a      colleagues. Hydrophobic fractionation of gum arabic revealed the presence\u000d\u000a      of three different fractions with different molecular weight and protein\u000d\u000a      content. Furthermore, they were able to identify the main fraction\u000d\u000a      responsible for emulsifying oil in water emulsions typically used in the\u000d\u000a      beverage industry.\u000d\u000a    Subsequent research carried out from 1998 - 2005 to further identify the\u000d\u000a      difference between various samples obtained from various locations as well\u000d\u000a      as the effect of processing (e.g. spray drying) led to establishing a\u000d\u000a      routine method for the characterisation of gum arabic by gel permeation\u000d\u000a      chromatography linked to multi angle laser light scattering, refractive\u000d\u000a      index and UV detectors. As a result it was possible to determine the\u000d\u000a      variation in crude and processed samples of gum arabic and clearly\u000d\u000a      identify the effect of processing. (Paper 2).\u000d\u000a    By linking the structural characteristics of the main fractions present\u000d\u000a      in gum Arabic, as well as the effect of processing, a new process was\u000d\u000a      invented in 2007 by Al-Assaf (Paper 3), enabling the modification\u000d\u000a      of these hydrocolloids without using chemical reagents and maintaining the\u000d\u000a      biocompatibility. The method is based on increasing the proportion of the\u000d\u000a      active ingredient responsible for emulsification. A process described as\u000d\u000a      maturation treatment increases the proportion of the active emulsifying\u000d\u000a      component and essentially mimics the natural process by which the active\u000d\u000a      component builds up naturally in the plant.\u000d\u000a    Al-Assaf and colleagues have further confirmed the mechanism (Paper 4)\u000d\u000a      of aggregation by direct comparison with another patented process [US\u000d\u000a      Patent 6,610,810 B2] we developed which relies on introducing C-C bond\u000d\u000a      between two polymeric chains.\u000d\u000a    The detailed emulsification mechanism of a range of natural food\u000d\u000a      emulsifiers was examined by Al-Assaf and Catellani of the Institut\u000d\u000a      National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), France and others. The\u000d\u000a      University's ability to provide well characterised natural food\u000d\u000a      emulsifiers and modified forms was combined with the measuring the\u000d\u000a      interfacial properties at both air\/liquid and liquid\/liquid interfaces and\u000d\u000a      was described in series of collaborative papers. The results were\u000d\u000a      interpreted jointly to correlate the interfacial properties with the\u000d\u000a      structural parameters to specifically identify the mechanism of\u000d\u000a      emulsification for a wide range of food emulsifiers which assisted the\u000d\u000a      design of new or improved formulations (Paper 5).\u000d\u000a    The maturation technology together with the understanding of the\u000d\u000a      molecular and interfacial properties of hydrocolloids was applied to corn\u000d\u000a      fibre gum (Paper 6). The results indicate that our process is\u000d\u000a      applicable to other proteinaceous hydrocolloids and also show that\u000d\u000a      organisation such as US Department of Agriculture is interested in\u000d\u000a      applying this technology to materials currently produced in 1000MT\u000d\u000a      quantity and treated as a waste product because it could not be used\u000d\u000a      without our process.\u000d\u000a    Professor Peter Williams &#8212; Professor of Hydrocolloids (1978 - present)\u000d\u000a      Professor Saphwan Al-Assaf - (2007 - present) (PDRA from 1998)\u000d\u000a    "}]

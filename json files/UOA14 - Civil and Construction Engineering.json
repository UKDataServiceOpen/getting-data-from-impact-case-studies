The\u000d\u000amodel's application by each of these organisations, and Professors Falconer and Lin's\u000d\u000aengagement with these organisations, has led to the following typical impacts in the REF period.\u000d\u000aEconomic &#8212; Buro Happold are currently using the model in the design of a major coastal waterway\u000d\u000adevelopment project in Kuwait. Sabah Al Ahmad Sea City will eventually accommodate 100,000\u000d\u000apeople. The pioneering development is being constructed in five phases, two of which hav\u000d\u000aalready been completed, and includes 180 km of shoreline, 2000 ha of water area and 81 million\u000d\u000am3 of water at high tide. The associated waterway network has been demonstrated to be viable as\u000d\u000aa direct consequence of Cardiff University's model. The waterway network is critical to the success\u000d\u000aand viability of the land-based development. DIVAST has been used for waterway alignment,\u000d\u000awaterway depth and width design, bridge, culverts and throttle design and flushing studies. The\u000d\u000aaverage price of serviced homes is &#163;300k. Each phase typically has a base value of\u000d\u000aapproximately &#163;1.2B prior to development. [5.1]\u000d\u000aBuro Happold's involvement in this project has developed and enhanced the company's\u000d\u000ainternational reputation in the coastal and marine engineering field. The CEO of Buro Happold\u000d\u000a(Paul Westbury, FREng) stated that: \"The research undertaken by Cardiff University and their on-\u000d\u000agoing technical support to Buro Happold has played a key part in our success in Sabah Al Ahmad\u000d\u000aSea City. This has resulted in really positive financial gain for the corporation (each of the five\u000d\u000aphases has an estimated base value of &#163;1.2B prior to development). Moreover, the scale and\u000d\u000asuccess of the Sea City venture has been used to exemplify our specialist expertise and\u000d\u000aexperience. It has consolidated our reputation and market positioning and led to successful bids\u000d\u000afor new, large scale contracts in Saudi Arabia, USA, China and Egypt (amounting to a combined\u000d\u000avalue that exceeds &#163;1M).\"  [5.2], [5.3]\u000d\u000aCH2M HILL (previously Halcrow) use the DIVAST suite to provide one of the principal engines for\u000d\u000atheir 2D flood inundation models ISIS 2D and 2D-TVD (2009). ISIS 2D (and TVD) is marketed `for\u000d\u000ause in surface water management plans and flood risk management studies'. The ISIS suite\u000d\u000aenables flood risk and hazards to be predicted, the impacts on people, property and the\u000d\u000aenvironment to be assessed and mitigation options to be tested (notably, Defra have stated that\u000d\u000athe economic cost of flooding, &#163;3.2B in 2007, could rise to &#163;12B by 2080). CH2M HILL (Halcrow)\u000d\u000ais recognised as being one of the world's leading consultants in flood risk modelling. Over the last\u000d\u000a60 years the company has operated in more than 120 countries and currently has more than 200\u000d\u000aprojects around the world connected to flood management. The models are widely used for\u000d\u000aflooding studies for UK and international clients; examples of users include the Environment\u000d\u000aAgency, Canals and Rivers Trust (formally British Waterways), Scottish Environment Protection\u000d\u000aAgency and Spain's Ministry for the Environment (CEDEX). Richard Crowder, Director at CH2M\u000d\u000aHILL, stated that `the research undertaken by Cardiff University, and their ongoing technical\u000d\u000arelationship with CH2M HILL, has made a significant contribution to the capabilities of the ISIS\u000d\u000asoftware suite. This has been fundamental to us securing and delivering major flood risk projects in\u000d\u000athe UK and across the globe, including a long term contract with a major global insurance company\u000d\u000ato develop national scale flood risk models'. [5.4]\u000d\u000aThe ISIS suite and the ISIS 2D engine can also be acquired by practitioners and researchers in\u000d\u000aboth a fully featured paid for and reduced functionality free version from the CH2M HILL website\u000d\u000a(ISIS FREE). To-date over 12,000 users have downloaded the free version. CH2M HILL estimates\u000d\u000athat the models have been used to study the protection of over &#163;10B assets to-date. [5.4],[5.5]\u000d\u000aEnvironmental and Health Benefits &#8212; NASA Earth Observatory have stated that 2 billion people\u000d\u000aare likely to be vulnerable to flooding by 2050. The use of the models, individually or in\u000d\u000acombination, serves to help reduce these statistics. CH2M HILL, for example, have used the\u000d\u000amodels (as part of ISIS 2D) to model over 700km of main river and major tributaries of the Siret\u000d\u000aRiver in Romania. This was to combat a series of flood occurrences in the last 40 years, including\u000d\u000aa major event in 2005 that resulted in fatalities, evacuations and damages to crops amounting to\u000d\u000a&#8364;500M. Another project supported the development of water management strategies in Argentina\u000d\u000aand Paraguay, The model simulated 90 days of a large flood event originating from the Pilcomayo\u000d\u000aRiver, which has one of the largest sediment loads in the world. Further examples include work for\u000d\u000athe Philippines Government, where the research is helping to map and manage potential flood risk\u000d\u000ascenarios for the entire country. [5.6]\u000d\u000aAnother use of the models concerns water quality. Illnesses derived from contact with\u000d\u000acontaminated water include gastroenteritis, respiratory tract, ear, eye and skin infections. Based on\u000d\u000adata regarding bather numbers (80 million swims per year), work for Defra infers that 1.3 million\u000d\u000acases of gastroenteritis each year could be associated with bathing in England and Wales. The\u000d\u000aEA North West used the linked model to establish the frequent cause of non-compliance of the\u000d\u000abathing waters at Lytham St Annes. The results illustrated that non-compliance at the bathing\u000d\u000abeach was due to bacterial inputs from the river Ribble and combined sewer overflows from\u000d\u000aPreston Wastewater Treatment Works. Following the outcome of a Public Inquiry in 2008, where\u000d\u000aProfessor Falconer was a key witness and the model was a key part of the evidence, United\u000d\u000aUtilities embarked on a &#163;114M upgrade of the Preston works. This will bring `significant\u000d\u000aenvironmental improvements to the Fylde coastal bathing waters (including Blackpool beaches)\u000d\u000aand designated shellfish beds located within the Ribble Estuary'. [5.7]\u000d\u000aImproving Industry Knowledge and Public Engagement &#8212;The research has been used to study\u000d\u000athe effects of the Severn Barrage and has significantly contributed to industrial knowledge and\u000d\u000astimulated public engagement The findings are of national and international significance,\u000d\u000aparticularly in terms of flood risk, water quality and power generation. They highlight that two-way\u000d\u000ageneration could produce almost as much power as the traditionally favoured option of ebb-only\u000d\u000ageneration, but with this operating approach considerably reducing the hydro-environmental\u000d\u000aconcerns about siting a barrage in the Severn Estuary. Since 2008, Professor Falconer has\u000d\u000adelivered over 160 presentations on the Severn Barrage, flood modelling and water security to\u000d\u000alearned societies, such as The Royal Academy of Engineering, and given numerous media\u000d\u000ainterviews to radio and TV channels &#8212; both in the UK and overseas. His research on the Severn\u000d\u000aBarrage also formed key evidence to the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change\u000d\u000aCommittee in January 2013.

It has been refined by\u000d\u000aFalconer and Lin (Lecturer in 1997, Senior Lecturer in 2002, Reader in 2005 and Professor in\u000d\u000a2007) at Cardiff since 1997. The research has partly been driven by changes to planning laws\u000d\u000aconcerning floodplains, increased flood insurance excesses, and increasing demands for improved\u000d\u000awater quality in rivers, estuaries and coastal basins.\u000d\u000aThe research covered in this case study commenced in 2000 with the integration of the DIVAST\u000d\u000amodel with Research Centre's 1D river model (FASTER). Key developments included: fluid\u000d\u000amomentum conservation and solute (i.e pollutants and sediments) mass conservation, with\u000d\u000aparticular emphasis on modelling dam break flows, and passing trans- and supercritical flows\u000d\u000aacross 1D-2D boundaries. For example, the new model was applied to an embankment breach\u000d\u000aalong the Thames, with CH2M HILL, through the Royal Academy Engineering's Industrial\u000d\u000aSecondment Scheme [3.1]. This refinement was extended to include lateral inflow\/outflow\u000d\u000aboundaries, linking 1D-2D flows, where the flow passes from a 1D river onto the 2D floodplain\u000d\u000a(EPSRC GR\/S76304).\u000d\u000aIn 2005 the model was refined from an implicit scheme to a novel and highly efficient shock\u000d\u000acapturing solver, giving highly accurate and efficient solutions for dam break and embankment\u000d\u000abreach flows. The model was subsequently developed to include a linked groundwater model\u000d\u000awithin the solver [3.2]. This enabled flooding in urban environments to be modelled more\u000d\u000aaccurately. Instead of using the traditional approach of blocking out cells covering buildings as\u000d\u000asolid cells; cells containing buildings are treated as highly impermeable and the groundwater\u000d\u000aequation for these cells is then solved. This innovative approach is more realistic in replicating the\u000d\u000aflooding of buildings on floodplains and is more accurate in predicting pollution levels in properties.\u000d\u000aSince 2007, laboratory experiments have been undertaken on the incipient motion of scaled cars\u000d\u000aand model people in idealised rivers under flood conditions. Up-scaled prototype formulations have\u000d\u000abeen developed for the onset of cars and people being moved by flood waters, both for buoyant\u000d\u000aand drowned vehicle conditions. These empirical equations have been developed for a range of\u000d\u000avehicles and have been included in the numerical models for commercial flood risk hazard\u000d\u000amapping [3.3],[3.4].\u000d\u000aIn collaboration with Aberystwyth University and the Environment Agency (EA), field and laboratory\u000d\u000astudies have been undertaken in the Severn and Ribble estuaries (2001-date). These studies\u000d\u000afocused on investigating the impact of turbidity on the decay (T90) of enteric bacteria and the\u000d\u000aadsorption\/desorption of bacteria with sediments as a function of turbidity levels in the estuary and\u000d\u000ain controlled conditions in the laboratory. New formulations have been developed and included in\u000d\u000aDIVAST for the relationship of the sink term in the solute transport equation. This involved the\u000d\u000amodelling of the dynamic decay process by relating T90 values for bacteria to turbidity levels, and\u000d\u000aadsorption\/desorption of bacteria as a function of the level of suspended sediment in the water\u000d\u000acolumn [3.5].\u000d\u000aMembers of the HRC contributing to the research include: Prof R A Falconer, Director of the\u000d\u000aHRC, Prof B Lin, Dr R Ahmadian and Dr B Bockelmann-Evans.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"3664","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Route to Impact: Cardiff University's research has been\u000d\u000a      integral to overcoming major obstacles associated with high level nuclear\u000d\u000a      waste disposal. Approximately 250 to 300 Ktons of high level nuclear waste\u000d\u000a      is in temporary storage facilities worldwide. Multinational governments\u000d\u000a      and international nuclear authorities, such as the International Atomic\u000d\u000a      Energy Authority (IAEA), have long recognised the necessity for a\u000d\u000a      permanent disposal solution. The preferred route is deep geological\u000d\u000a      disposal. Not only does this absolve the necessity for constant\u000d\u000a      supervision and maintenance, and reduce security risks associated with\u000d\u000a      ground level storage, but it prohibits future generations from inheriting\u000d\u000a      a nuclear waste legacy. However, whilst theoretically appropriate, the\u000d\u000a      technical complexities of achieving this have meant the aim remained\u000d\u000a      unrealised. The enormous timescale over which high level nuclear waste is\u000d\u000a      radioactive and deadly to all living organisms (in excess of 100,000\u000d\u000a      years) poses a huge challenge to governments and international nuclear\u000d\u000a      authorities to ensure no nuclear releases reach surface level, resulting\u000d\u000a      in catastrophic health and environmental threats. The computerised model\u000d\u000a      developed at the Geoenvironmental Research Centre (GRC) provides\u000d\u000a      innovative predictions of the behaviour and long term durability of\u000d\u000a      engineered clay barriers (consisting of bentonite) under specific\u000d\u000a      repository conditions. The research was funded by the EC under their\u000d\u000a      EURATOM programme, a programme that is part- funded by the EC itself, and\u000d\u000a      part-funded by European Nuclear Waste Disposal Authorities [5.1]. The work\u000d\u000a      performed was therefore immediately \"captured\" by the Waste Disposal\u000d\u000a      Authorities (for example, in the UK, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Canada and\u000d\u000a      Germany) and could be deployed in various aspects of the performance\u000d\u000a      assessment of geological repositories [5.2]. The findings increased\u000d\u000a      international governments' confidence in the ability to accurately model\u000d\u000a      and forecast the behaviour of engineered clay barriers. Subsequently,\u000d\u000a      several countries issued licences and have begun the process of\u000d\u000a      constructing nuclear waste repositories.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Engineering Design: Given their inherent\u000d\u000a      complexity, application of the newly developed THM\/THCM models to\u000d\u000a      repository design can only be achieved via the use of numerical methods of\u000d\u000a      analysis. In the GRC's case, this yielded the computer program called\u000d\u000a      COMPASS, which was developed in-house. This program can be used to\u000d\u000a      simulate the behaviour of a nuclear waste repository over a period of many\u000d\u000a      years. The main design criteria that can be considered via the use of the\u000d\u000a      software are in relation to:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The temperature effects and the borehole spacings required, to ensure\u000d\u000a        that the maximum specified temperatures are not exceeded.\u000d\u000a      The hydraulic effects and the total time for re-saturation of the\u000d\u000a        repository; this design parameter marks the end phase of the initial\u000d\u000a        life of a repository.\u000d\u000a      The mechanical effects, the swelling pressures and displacements that\u000d\u000a        are generated as a result of moisture ingress.\u000d\u000a      The chemical effects, a repository's response due to changes in the\u000d\u000a        chemical composition of the pore water.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a      All of the above are key features in the overall design of a\u000d\u000a        repository. They are principal elements of a safety assessment and,\u000d\u000a        consequently, are fundamental factors in a Licence Application. The\u000d\u000a        software has been accessed and applied (as aforementioned, via the\u000d\u000a        EURATOM programme) by International Nuclear Waste Disposal Authorities.\u000d\u000a        Work with SKB, the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company,\u000d\u000a        for example, was conducted at a specially built Underground Research\u000d\u000a        Laboratory (URL), the Aspoe Rock Laboratory, on the island of Aspoe (http:\/\/www.skb.se\/default____24417.aspx).\u000a        During the REF period, work conducted at the URL was used to inform\u000d\u000a        decisions regarding the site selection for a final repository. The\u000d\u000a        search had been ongoing for 20 years but was narrowed to two options,\u000d\u000a        Forsmark and Oskarshamn. The results of the research provided new\u000d\u000a        insights into the behaviour of the bentonite buffer under a range of\u000d\u000a        conditions, as described above, and determined the suitability of the\u000d\u000a        rock at each site. Subsequently, in June 2009, SKB made the decision to\u000d\u000a        locate the repository at Forsmark. This heralded a landmark event in the\u000d\u000a        process of achieving a fully operational nuclear waste repository. Based\u000d\u000a        on the site selection, an application to construct the repository was\u000d\u000a        submitted to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority and the\u000d\u000a        environmental court in March 2011. The Swedish repository at Forsmark is\u000d\u000a        expected to be filled by 2025 [5.3].\u000d\u000a      The greatest progress has been made in Finland, where the repository\u000d\u000a        design is similar to the Swedish concept. Posiva, the Finish nuclear\u000d\u000a        waste management company (also part of the EURATOM research programmes),\u000d\u000a        has significantly benefited from Cardiff's unique research. Excavation\u000d\u000a        and design work at the selected site (Olkiluoto) began in 2004 (http:\/\/www.posiva.fi\/en\/research_development\/onkalo).\u000a        Between 2008-2013, excavation of the access tunnel to the repository\u000d\u000a        (named Onkalo) was completed. In February 2012 this reached the target\u000d\u000a        depth of 455m below ground. In December 2012 the final design plans were\u000d\u000a        also completed [5.4]. These would not have been possible without Cardiff\u000d\u000a        University's research, which is cited in official reports describing the\u000d\u000a        technology employed at Onkalo [5.5]. Posiva have publicly stated that `the\u000a          long-term safety of final disposal is, above all, based on carefully\u000d\u000a          studied, complimentary engineered barriers' [5.6]. The design\u000d\u000a        plans formed the basis of an application for a full construction\u000d\u000a        licence, which was submitted to the Radiation and Nuclear Authority of\u000d\u000a        Finland (STUK) in December 2012. In April 2013, STUK reported a positive\u000d\u000a        response to initial reviews of the licence application. Activity at\u000d\u000a        Onkalo is now focused on structural work; the final disposal of nuclear\u000d\u000a        waste at the repository is scheduled to start in 2020 [5.7].\u000d\u000a      Global nuclear authorities support for Onkalo is illustrated by\u000d\u000a        endorsement from the IAEA In August 2012 the Director, General Yukiya\u000d\u000a        Amanom, visited Onkalo in a two day official visit. He stated that `This\u000a          development is good news for Finland and for the world, since\u000d\u000a          Finland's success as a forerunner in mastering this significant\u000d\u000a          engineering challenge will offer alternatives for other nations\u000d\u000a          seeking to sustainably and responsibly manage spent fuel.' [5.8]\u000d\u000a      Impact on Public Policy and Services: The disposal of\u000d\u000a        high level nuclear waste is a worldwide problem and the GRC's research\u000d\u000a        has been taken up on a global scale. In particular, the GRC has been\u000d\u000a        designated by the IAEA as a \"Centre of Excellence\/Expertise\" [5.9]. In\u000d\u000a        this context, the GRC is a founder member of the Agency's Underground\u000d\u000a        Research Facilities Network (URF), dedicated to \"building confidence\u000d\u000a          in the geological disposal of high level nuclear waste\". The role\u000d\u000a        of the network is to deliver training and demonstration activities\u000d\u000a        related to high level nuclear waste. Training courses and coordinated\u000d\u000a        research programmes are pursued, with the overall objective of\u000d\u000a        transferring good practice from countries with developed programmes,\u000d\u000a        such as in Scandinavia, to those countries that are just beginning to\u000d\u000a        embark on the difficult task of implementing a geological disposal\u000d\u000a        option. Virtually all of the countries with a civil nuclear programme\u000d\u000a        take part. The GRC has participated extensively in these programmes, via\u000d\u000a        the delivery of training courses and execution of research programmes.\u000d\u000a        It is claimed that the impact of the work is significant, particularly\u000d\u000a        in relation to the important issue of capacity building. It is\u000d\u000a        anticipated that this will help \"build confidence\" in the geological\u000d\u000a        disposal programme worldwide. Since 2007 the GRC's Director (Prof H R\u000d\u000a        Thomas) has served as Chair to the network and in this capacity has also\u000d\u000a        been instrumental in shaping and guiding policy developments in this\u000d\u000a        area.\u000d\u000a      Economic Impact: &#163;200M investment has been made from\u000d\u000a        2008-2013, by SKB, as a direct consequence of the research. The final\u000d\u000a        cost of Onkalo is expected to be &#8364;3.3B. However this sum is markedly\u000d\u000a        less than the expense of continuing storage of high level nuclear waste\u000d\u000a        (at Sellafield in the UK, for example, this amounts to &#163;1.6B per year,\u000d\u000a        in addition to the cost of cleanup and maintenance work, which is priced\u000d\u000a        at &#163;67.5B - http:\/\/www.nao.org.uk\/report\/managing-risk-\u000a          reduction-at-sellafield\/). The activities that the research has\u000d\u000a        enabled, highlighted by the scale of investment, are a major step\u000d\u000a        towards a permanent long-term solution to high level nuclear waste\u000d\u000a        disposal. [5.10]\u000d\u000a      In summary, the research conducted at the GRC has orchestrated a major\u000d\u000a        development in nuclear waste disposal. The resulting impact has had both\u000d\u000a        global reach and significance.\u000d\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted at the Geoenvironmental Research Centre (GRC),\u000d\u000a      supported by the European Commission via its EURATOM programme, has been\u000d\u000a      instrumental in addressing the long standing global problem of high level\u000d\u000a      nuclear waste disposal. The pioneering development of a sophisticated\u000d\u000a      coupled thermal\/hydraulic\/chemical\/mechanical model of clay behaviour has\u000d\u000a      provided new understanding of the performance of engineered barriers\u000d\u000a      proposed for use in nuclear waste repositories. This has, in an\u000d\u000a      unprecedented development, directly enabled the design of numerous nuclear\u000d\u000a      waste repositories to proceed. The repositories in Sweden and Finland are\u000d\u000a      currently at \"Licence application\" and \"Construction\" phases,\u000d\u000a      respectively.

Key\u000d\u000a      research developments since 1993 are outlined below.\u000d\u000a    Thermo\/Hydro\/Mechanical (THM) behaviour: The first step in\u000d\u000a      developing a suitable model of THM behaviour was to extend the GRC's\u000d\u000a      research on coupled thermo\/hydraulic behaviour [3.1] to accommodate soil\u000d\u000a      deformation [3.2]. This was achieved in collaboration with International\u000d\u000a      co- workers, notably Professors Alonso and Gens at UPC Barcelona, who were\u000d\u000a      developing new models of unsaturated soil deformation. This work was\u000d\u000a      carried out as part of major European Commission funded research, under\u000d\u000a      the EURATOM programme. This yielded the first approach to simulating\u000d\u000a      coupled THM behaviour.\u000d\u000a    Micro\/macro behaviour of clays: The GRC's\u000d\u000a      investigation (1996-2003) into the re-saturation behaviour of clay\u000d\u000a      barriers in a large-scale, in-situ experiment at Atomic Energy of Canada's\u000d\u000a      (AECL) underground research laboratory established that neither the\u000d\u000a      duration nor the pattern of moisture influx could be predicted accurately\u000d\u000a      using a conventional hydraulic conductivity model. It showed that the\u000d\u000a      expansion of the microstructure of the bentonite reduced the pore spaces\u000d\u000a      available for water transport in the macrostructure, as the material,\u000d\u000a      overall, was constrained from swelling. This in turn was likely to reduce\u000d\u000a      the material's hydraulic conductivity and was of major significance in the\u000d\u000a      estimation of repository re-saturation times [3.3]. This work was extended\u000d\u000a      [3.4] to include heating. Simulation of pre-heating phases demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that the model could describe the hydraulic regime in the host rock and\u000d\u000a      isothermal infiltration into the buffer.\u000d\u000a    Chemical reaction modelling: The above work\u000d\u000a      demonstrated very clearly the importance of the physico-chemical behaviour\u000d\u000a      of bentonitic soils. A multicomponent transport formulation was therefore\u000d\u000a      developed and coupled with a multiphase geochemical reaction model. This\u000d\u000a      was achieved by coupling the THM and chemical transport model with a\u000d\u000a      geochemical reaction model (MINTEQA2). The coupled model was applied to\u000d\u000a      study various aspects of chemical behaviour during the period of heating\u000d\u000a      and hydration in the buffer [3.5]. Several relevant hydro-geochemical\u000d\u000a      features were then incorporated between 2007 and 2012, from a theoretical\u000d\u000a      modelling approach at micro scale to the inclusion of multicomponent\u000d\u000a      diffusion. The existing THCM model was coupled with an advanced\u000d\u000a      geochemical model (PHREEQC), which allows high ionic concentrations and\u000d\u000a      kinetically-controlled geochemical reactions to be simulated [3.6].\u000d\u000a    Computational Modelling Aspects: A simulation of the\u000d\u000a      Prototype Repository experiment, undertaken by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel\u000d\u000a      and Waste Management Co. (SKB), demonstrated that parallel computation is\u000d\u000a      invaluable because of the complex, highly coupled nature of the problem.\u000d\u000a      The temperature field was found to be three-dimensional, with the effect\u000d\u000a      of adjacent canisters' heat output influencing the temperature within\u000d\u000a      other deposition holes. In addition, the significance of the backfill as a\u000d\u000a      substantial sink for pore-water was demonstrated, reproducing the\u000d\u000a      saturation time exhibited experimentally. The geological supply of water\u000d\u000a      was critical to the hydration rate.\u000d\u000a    This research, in addition to the wider work of the Centre, has directly\u000d\u000a      led to the GRC being awarded the 2013 Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher\u000d\u000a      and Further Education.

Such figures are repeated\u000a        elsewhere, but local authorities and producers are reluctant to publish\u000a        figures due to the possible\u000a        public disquiet on the issue.\u000a      Food grown with irrigation from wastewater is not only consumed locally\u000a        and much of it is exported.\u000a        For example, UK and European supermarkets sell food irrigated in this\u000a        way and clearly need to\u000a        ensure that this is done to acceptable standards. GLOBALG.A.P.\u000a        (http:\/\/www.globalgap.org)\u000a        represents the major UK and European supermarkets; it sets standards for\u000a        the certification of\u000a        production processes of agricultural products around the globe, and\u000a        serves as a practical manual\u000a        for Good Agricultural Practice (G.A.P.) anywhere in the world.\u000a        Recognising the scale of wastewater\u000a        re-use in agriculture, GLOBALG.A.P has followed WHO policies on\u000a        wastewater use and food from\u000a        countries not complying with WHO standards is likely to be rejected.\u000a        Figures on the exact amount\u000a        of food covered by this are difficult to obtain as retailers and\u000a        producers are reluctant to divulge\u000a        figures due to public attitudes. However, given that the UK alone\u000a        imports nearly half its food the\u000a        trade is significant.\u000a      The Leeds researchers were key to the research behind the WHO policy as\u000a        confirmed by [A]\u000a        \"...the team at Leeds played a significant and central role in the\u000a        development of the risk-based\u000a        approach to setting wastewater reuse standards...\", [B] \"Basic\u000a        scientific research carried out by the\u000a        team at Leeds was used in the establishment of the approach and in\u000a        setting acceptable levels of\u000a        health risk\" and [C] \"...the University of Leeds has played an important\u000a        role in developing new\u000a        approaches to assess and manage the risk associated with wastewater\u000a        reuse, and in helping to\u000a        operationalize the 2006 Guidelines...\".\u000a      Changing international policy and guidelines\u000a      The scientific justification for risk-based standards for wastewater\u000a        reuse developed on the basis of this\u000a        research at Leeds and others, has enabled the widespread adoption of\u000a        safe and affordable wastewater\u000a        irrigation in the REF period as confirmed by WHO and the World Bank [A,\u000a        B, C]. In 2010 the World\u000a        Bank issued a Policy Research Working Paper [C, D] on wastewater re-use\u000a        of which Mara was a\u000a        co-author and adopted a quantitative risk-based approach to wastewater\u000a        re-use which extends the\u000a        scope of water re-use to crop irrigation [C, D]. Prior to 2010 less than\u000a        1% of the World Bank's\u000a        portfolio of wastewater investments included provision for reuse so this\u000a        was a significant change in\u000a        approach.\u000a      The adoption of the QMRA approach and risk-based regulation by\u000a        organisations such as WHO and\u000a        the World Bank has led to its adoption around the globe, especially in\u000a        countries with strongly-\u000a        governed water markets (see below) [C, D].\u000a      Changes in operations of international organisations\u000a      The impact on policy has in turn been operationalized through the World\u000a        Bank commissioning\u000a        country-level analyses (2010 [C]) to assess the potential and benefits\u000a        of wastewater re-use. For\u000a        example, work by Barbara Evans (Leeds) for the World Bank [E] on the\u000a        Nile Basin (where close to\u000a        10 billion m3 of drainage water is used in agriculture\u000a        annually) developed a QMRA-based\u000a        methodology to identify the most cost-effective wastewater treatment\u000a        options in specific drainage\u000a        basins of the Nile delta [C, E]. Use of the methodology in the study\u000a        identified lower-cost waste\u000a        management options that are as much as six times more cost-effective\u000a        (expressed as dollars spent\u000a        per Disability-adjusted Life-Year saved in health terms) than the\u000a        conventional high-energy\u000a        wastewater treatment processes currently favoured [E]. This is described\u000a        by the World Bank as\u000a        \"one of the first practical examples of how to operationalize the 2006\u000a        WHO Guidelines and the\u000a        2010 World Bank Policy Research Paper\" [C]\u000a      Changing national strategies for agricultural development and\u000a          practice\u000a      The main example of impact in the REF period is through the World Bank\u000a        policy and operations\u000a        cited above. However, the reach of this impact can be seen from the\u000a        following examples of\u000a        countries which have adopted elements of the approach developed with\u000a        inputs from the team at\u000a        Leeds include:\u000a      \u000a        Australia: senate now requires states to include elements of water\u000a          recycling in infrastructure\u000a          redevelopment programmes;\u000a        Jordan: upgraded treatment through a private-sector\u000a          build-operate-transfer scheme [F];\u000a        Tunisia: now treats most of its urban wastewater, uses 30% of the\u000a          treated effluent to irrigate\u000a          7,000 ha of fruit trees and fodder crops following strict sanitary\u000a          standards, and plans to\u000a          expand wastewater irrigation to 20,000-30,000 ha by 2020 [G: Page\u000a          167];\u000a        50% of Israel's irrigation water is provided from sewage [H] and\u000a          this is being expanded [I].\u000a          The impact of the above on food production has been on-going during\u000a          the REF impact period.\u000a      \u000a      Continuing developments\u000a      Mara has continued to work with WHO, to review the approach.\u000a        Further use of the QMRA tools\u000a        developed at Leeds has led to a call for a further relaxation of some of\u000a        the health-risk thresholds\u000a        used in the 2006 Guidelines, which would make wastewater reuse more\u000a        cost-effective in poor\u000a        countries [for example J].\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Re-use of wastewater for irrigation is essential to secure global food\u000a      security, but it poses serious\u000a      health risks.

The work was led by Duncan Mara with Andrew Sleigh at Leeds and\u000a      included Rafael Bastos\u000a      (Visiting Professor from Universidad Federal de Vicosa) and Howard Pearson\u000a      (University of\u000a      Liverpool), working in collaboration with Ursula Blumenthal (London School\u000a      of Hygiene and\u000a      Tropical Medicine) and others [1, 2]. The Leeds team also investigated the\u000a      effectiveness of\u000a      wastewater treatment processes typically used in developing countries in\u000a      the removal of pathogens\u000a      [3].\u000a    Combining findings from these studies, the researchers calculated\u000a      exposure rates to pathogens for\u000a      farmers and consumers of crops that are irrigated using treated wastewater\u000a      of various qualities.\u000a      Mara and Blumenthal thus developed an approach which linked\u000a      selection of treatment processes\u000a      and irrigation techniques to resultant health risks faced by exposed\u000a      downstream users.\u000a    Quantifying the risks from re-used water\u000a    The Leeds research triggered progressive evaluations of the then current\u000a      1989 World Health\u000a      Organization (WHO) guidelines on wastewater re-use. These guidelines had\u000a      been based on the\u000a      assumption that water for irrigation should meet the same absolute water\u000a      quality limits associated\u000a      with drinking water. In 2000 Mara and other collaborators used their\u000a      research findings to call for a\u000a      risk-based approach to wastewater quality standards for irrigation [4]\u000a      which would significantly\u000a      increase the scope for using wastewater in irrigation.\u000a    Further studies carried out at Leeds by Mara and Sleigh from 2000 onwards\u000a      contributed to a\u000a      growing body of data from many sources which provided the basis for\u000a      quantitative methods to\u000a      characterise the human health risks associated with exposure to\u000a      water-based pathogens. This\u000a      data-driven risk analysis was formalised into an approach known as\u000a      Quantifiable Microbial Risk\u000a      Assessment (QMRA) [6].\u000a    QMRA is extremely complex and difficult to apply in practice, not least\u000a      because it requires\u000a      epidemiological field data. However, modelling and numerical analyses\u000a      studies by Mara and Sleigh\u000a      developed a robust Monte Carlo approach to QMRA, culminating in the\u000a      production of a simple-to-\u000a      use suite of programs which produces results close to those obtained from\u000a      field studies.\u000a    Mara and Sleigh, again collaborating with others, used their\u000a      Monte-Carlo-based QMRA tools to\u000a      demonstrate that the health risks from consuming crops irrigated with\u000a      treated wastewater were\u000a      similar to those posed by drinking fully-treated drinking water. This work\u000a      was the first to challenge\u000a      previous thinking and showed the quality of effluent from wastewater\u000a      treatment plants which can\u000a      safely be used for irrigation is significantly lower than was previously\u000a      thought [5].\u000a    Risk-based standards\u000a    From 2004 Mara worked closely with Blumenthal and Richard Carr (World\u000a      Health Organisation) to\u000a      develop a generalisable approach to risk-based standard-setting which\u000a      could be used in a new\u000a      edition of the WHO guidelines [5]. This was the basis for Chapter 3\u000a      \"Assessment of Health Risk\" of\u000a      the 2006 Guidelines (World Health Organization (2006).

The more severe the\u000a      crash, the more likely it is that driver speed is a contributory factor.\u000a      Despite the introduction of speed-calming measures such as road humps,\u000a      lane narrowings and speed cameras, many drivers continue to exceed speed\u000a      limits.\u000a    Safety tests of new cars\u000a    The key impact of the ITS Leeds research has been to drive a significant\u000a      change to European-wide `quasi-regulation' concerning the safety features\u000a      of new cars. More specifically, the European car safety testing agency\u000a      Euro NCAP took the decision in 2012 to award extra points to new vehicles\u000a      fitted with ISA from 2013 onwards. Only systems with a proven safety\u000a      contribution to crash avoidance and mitigation are recognised under the\u000a      new `Safety Assist' procedure, and ISA is one of only three crash and\u000a      injury prevention technologies that are given extra points as part of the\u000a      overall safety evaluation of new cars (the others are seatbelt reminders\u000a      and electronic stability control). In the points system, a higher score is\u000a      given for cars with intervening as opposed to purely advisory ISA.\u000a    A letter from the Chair of the relevant NCAP working group [A] confirms\u000a      that: \"...research by the University [i.e. by ITS Leeds] on\u000a        the safety impact of ISA provided important evidence to underpin our\u000a        decision to award points under the Euro NCAP Safety Assist protocol to\u000a        new cars fitted with ISA and to give extra points to vehicles fitted\u000a        with intervening ISA systems\". The norm with new Euro NCAP\u000a      requirements is rapid change by the car industry to comply.\u000a    New vehicle regulations\u000a    A more general impact of the research has been the stimulus to policy\u000a      debate in the area of new vehicle regulations. Formal (as opposed to\u000a      quasi) regulation for new vehicles is set at a European or international\u000a      (UN-ECE) level. In 2013, prior to a formal legislative process, the EU\u000a      announced to stakeholders that it is actively considering compulsory ISA\u000a      deployment in new vehicles, citing ITS Leeds research [B]. Such regulation\u000a      would affect light and heavy trucks as well as cars.\u000a    Contributing to road safety policy - national and international\u000a    Further stimulus to policy debate and development has occurred in the\u000a      area of road safety policy. The research undertaken by ITS Leeds since\u000a      1995 has produced a body of evidence which shows that ISA systems in\u000a      vehicles - which either automatically prevent the cars from exceeding\u000a      speed limits or advise drivers (and riders) when they go too fast - can\u000a      significantly reduce the risk of injury accidents and fatalities. Drawing\u000a      on this research, policy-makers at national, European and international\u000a      levels have all highlighted the ISA approach as an effective - and cost\u000a      effective - way to deliver large safety improvements.\u000a    For example, the 2008 OECD report `Towards Zero' on road safety\u000a      strategy drew upon ITS Leeds research [2] in recommending ISA as a key\u000a      intervention for large reductions in road accident injuries: \"Research\u000a        in the UK by Carsten and Tate (2005) suggests that the mandatory use of\u000a        a supportive ISA system could bring about a reduction of serious crashes\u000a        of up to 50%, while the use of an informative ISA system could result in\u000a        a 2-10% reduction in crashes.\" [C]\u000a    In 2008, and also citing [2], the Global Road Safety Partnership,\u000a      collaborating with the World Health Organization, the FIA Foundation and\u000a      the World Bank, also recommended ISA as a tool for speed management [D].\u000a      This `good practice manual' is promoted by the World Health Organization\u000a      as part of its `Decade for Road Safety' to promote global action on\u000a      road safety.\u000a    Again in 2008, the UK governmental advisory bodies CfIT and the\u000a      Motorists' Forum recommended- on the basis of the commissioned ISA\u000a      research and specifically reference [5] - the deployment of ISA, and\u000a      issued recommendations on the next steps required to bring about this\u000a      change [E].\u000a    Shaping environmental and transport policy debate\u000a    A final impact of the ITS Leeds research has been the stimulus to policy\u000a      debate in the area of transport and the environment. In 2010, the UK\u000a      Sustainable Development Commission used the ITS Leeds analysis of the\u000a      effects of ISA on CO2 emissions to argue that ISA would help to\u000a      reduce the carbon footprint of transport by reducing speeds and therefore\u000a      making motoring more fuel efficient. In particular, the Commission used\u000a      the ITS Leeds evidence to recommend that the UK Government should \"accelerate\u000a        actions to enable the widespread introduction of voluntary Intelligent\u000a        Speed Adaptation technology\" (where \"voluntary\" means an overridable\u000a      intervening system) [F].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken by the Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) at the\u000a      University of Leeds from 1995 to 2012 has demonstrated that in-vehicle\u000a      intelligent speed adaption (ISA) - technology to discourage or restrict\u000a      speeding - reduces drivers' propensity to speed and consequently can\u000a      dramatically reduce injury and fatality risk. ITS Leeds research has also\u000a      shown the environmental benefits of these systems and their high\u000a      acceptance by users and the public. This evidence has led policy-makers at\u000a      national, European and international levels to advocate ISA adoption. A\u000a      key impact has been Euro NCAP's decision in 2013 - directly informed by\u000a      the ITS Leeds research - to explicitly recognise ISA within the safety\u000a      ratings of new cars. To this end, the ITS Leeds research has informed a\u000a      significant change to European-wide `quasi-regulation' and, through\u000a      encouragement to car manufacturers, imposed lasting influence on the\u000a      safety features of new cars.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Leeds\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Leeds (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Leeds","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007795}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

These systems allow a vehicle to monitor the\u000a      permitted or recommended maximum speed for the road. ISA typically works\u000a      by coding speed limits into an in-vehicle digital road map which is then\u000a      combined with a positioning system (e.g. GPS). The system can thus\u000a      determine the legal or advisory speed limit for the current section of\u000a      road, and then advise speeding drivers to slow down or even prevent them\u000a      from accelerating beyond the legal or recommended maximum.\u000a    Simulator experiments demonstrate how ISA affects driving behaviour\u000a    In 1995, Professor Oliver Carsten received EPSRC funding [i] to\u000a      investigate the behavioural effects of ISA on people's driving. Under\u000a      Carsten, Samantha Comte (now Jamson) ran experiments using the University\u000a      of Leeds Driving Simulator to assess how ISA would affect speed choice and\u000a      other aspects of urban driving behaviour. The experimental data and\u000a      qualitative responses showed that, whilst participants' propensity to\u000a      speed was strongly affected, there were also some short-term compensation\u000a      effects which could perhaps be attributed to initial unfamiliarity with\u000a      ISA [1].\u000a    In-vehicle trials, cost-benefits and complementary studies\u000a    With ISA showing promise as a system for accident and fatality reduction,\u000a      ITS Leeds and the Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA) collaborated\u000a      between 1997 and 2000 in a wide-ranging government-funded study (the EVSC\u000a      project), which included on-road studies of driver behaviour in a car\u000a      fitted with an ISA system [ii]. Researchers from MIRA integrated sensor\u000a      and actuator technologies into a car and created digital maps for the test\u000a      routes. The ITS Leeds researchers devised the testing protocols and\u000a      analysed the vehicle data to determine the effects of ISA on behaviour and\u000a      accident risk [1].\u000a    Using microsimulation techniques, they also examined the subsequent\u000a      impacts of ISA-equipped vehicles on other traffic [ii], finding that the\u000a      effects of ISA would probably be cumulative if more than 60% of vehicles\u000a      were equipped with the technology. Given the observed changes in speed,\u000a      ISA would have a substantial impact on injuries and fatalities and was\u000a      highly favourable in cost- benefit terms [2].\u000a    In 2003, the growing evidence on the benefits of ISA led to a large-scale\u000a      trial (\"Field Operational Test\") of the system funded by the Department\u000a      for Transport (DfT) [iii]. This involved the adaptation of 20 cars by\u000a      MIRA, and the collection of data on everyday driving from 79 drivers\u000a      living and working in urban and rural settings. The project logged more\u000a      than 400,000 miles of driving, with over 200,000 miles using an ISA linked\u000a      to mapping data and technology provided by Navigation Technologies\u000a      (NAVTEQ), a leading provider of digital road maps and associated software.\u000a    This Field Operational Test showed that all categories of drivers,\u000a      including those admitting a tendency to speed, had their speeding\u000a      behaviour improved when driving with ISA across a variety of road\u000a      categories, even though the tested system allowed them to override the\u000a      speed limitation. Indeed, the effects tended to be larger for\u000a      speed-intenders (those who wish to speed), with for example a 27%\u000a      reduction in motorway speeding and a 10% reduction in urban speeding\u000a      accompanied by a very substantial overall reduction in high-speed driving.\u000a      The ITS Leeds team also predicted the likely safety impacts, which once\u000a      again were found to be substantial, particularly as regards serious\u000a      injuries and fatalities. The research analysed alternative paths to\u000a      implementation and showed that ISA was highly positive in cost-benefit\u000a      terms over the 60 year period required by DfT appraisal guidance,\u000a      especially the `stronger' forms of the technology that automatically limit\u000a      speeds to the legal maximum [3].\u000a    Environmental studies\u000a    In 2007, Carsten and his team received funding from the Commission for\u000a      Integrated Transport and the Motorists' Forum to remodel the data\u000a      generated by the large-scale trial [iv], using up-to-date national fuel\u000a      models to analyse the impact of ISA on emissions and fuel economy. Dr Paul\u000a      Goodman carried out a detailed assessment of ISA's effect on CO2\u000a      emissions and fuel economy, finding that speed limitation generated an\u000a      immediate 5% fuel saving for motorway driving. A national survey devised\u000a      by Dr Kathryn Chorlton and Professor Stephane Hess of around 18,000\u000a      households revealed substantial support for ISA implementation and\u000a      indicated that drivers were generally willing to pay up to &#163;100 for an ISA\u000a      system [4, 5].

Corroborating the role\u000d\u000a      played by ITS Leeds, ORR [A, p126] noted: \"...the econometric analysis\u000d\u000a        work was undertaken by ITS working closely with both Network Rail and\u000d\u000a        ourselves\".\u000d\u000a    The value of the efficiency targets set by ORR, based on the ITS Leeds\u000d\u000a      evidence, was to reduce the cost of maintaining and renewing Network\u000d\u000a      Rail's infrastructure from around &#163;18.2bn to &#163;15.8bn over the five year\u000d\u000a      regulatory control period (2009\/10 to 2013\/14). Note that this reduction\u000d\u000a      is smaller than 37% because ORR phased the target gradually over a ten\u000d\u000a      year period. A letter of corroboration from ORR [B] notes: \"Following\u000d\u000a        the PR08 process, assisted by the ITS econometric efficiency model, ORR\u000d\u000a        deemed that the efficient cost should be only &#163;15.8bn (in 2006-7\u000d\u000a        prices). This work thus directly influenced the determination by the ORR\u000d\u000a        of Network Rail's funding for CP4, much of which is provided by\u000d\u000a        taxpayers\".\u000d\u000a    The second study commissioned by ORR [2] was also an international\u000d\u000a      econometric modelling exercise, but this time expanding the sample size by\u000d\u000a      utilising sub-company (regional) data within individual railways (drawn\u000d\u000a      from a sample of participating European and North American railways). The\u000d\u000a      model from this second exercise was quoted in ORR's 2008 determination as\u000d\u000a      a supporting, corroborating study to the first study outlined above [A,\u000d\u000a      p125].\u000d\u000a    Setting standards for rail regulatory reviews\u000d\u000a    In its review of ORR's regulatory efficiency analysis, the National Audit\u000d\u000a      Office in 2011 noted that: \"...the Regulator initiated an innovative\u000d\u000a        international benchmarking exercise with the Institute of Transport\u000d\u000a        Studies (University of Leeds) during its 2008 Periodic Review\" [C,\u000d\u000a      p31].\u000d\u000a    Since the 2008 Periodic Review, the approach was further developed and\u000d\u000a      used in subsequent assessments; ITS Leeds modelling supported the ORR's\u000d\u000a      Annual Efficiency Update process in 2010 [D]. Furthermore, Smith and Wheat\u000d\u000a      were seconded part-time to ORR during 2012 and 2013 to advise the\u000d\u000a      regulator on its benchmarking methods for the 2013 Periodic Review; their\u000d\u000a      contribution is acknowledged in the 2013 Draft Determination [E].\u000d\u000a    Informing policy &#8212; the long-term future of Britain's rail system\u000d\u000a    The modelling work [1, 2] also formed the basis of future efficiency\u000d\u000a      targets for Network Rail (CP5; 2014\/15 onwards) documented in the Sir Roy\u000d\u000a      McNulty Rail Value for Money study (which commenced in 2010 and was\u000d\u000a      published in 2011) [F]. This is arguably the most significant report on\u000d\u000a      rail costs in Britain, which has assessed efficiency and value for money\u000d\u000a      since privatisation and takes a long-term perspective on its future.\u000d\u000a    A letter of corroboration from DfT [G] notes: \"The [McNulty] study\u000a        represented a major review of rail costs, efficiency and value for\u000d\u000a        money, and set out a new policy direction based on its analysis and\u000d\u000a        findings. The study identified savings for the whole industry of between\u000d\u000a        &#163;2.5bn and &#163;3.5bn per year (or 20-30% of total system costs), of which\u000d\u000a        the savings identified for Network Rail from the work conducted by ITS\u000d\u000a        accounted for &#163;1.8bn per year (&#163;1.2bn per year earmarked to be achieved\u000d\u000a        by the end of CP4 and a further &#163;0.6bn per year by the end of CP5)\".\u000d\u000a      Through implementing the recommendations of this study (and because of\u000d\u000a      growing passenger revenues), the level of subsidy paid to the railway is\u000d\u000a      forecast to fall from &#163;4bn in 2010-11 to around &#163;1bn by 2019.\u000d\u000a    In addition, ITS Leeds research (a project report for ORR based on [4]\u000d\u000a      and an earlier conference paper version of [5]) is also quoted by McNulty\u000d\u000a      [F] as a key piece of evidence, amongst others, in determining future\u000d\u000a      targets for train operating costs.\u000d\u000a    Changing practice in other regulated sectors\u000d\u000a    Extending the reach of the research impacts to other sectors, ITS Leeds\u000d\u000a      was commissioned (with consultants CEPA) by the water regulator OFWAT in\u000d\u000a      summer 2012, to develop new econometric models and advise on how they\u000d\u000a      could be used to set a `corridor' for allowed cost levels, whilst\u000d\u000a      complying with the OFWAT's aim to achieve a \"light touch\" approach to\u000d\u000a      regulation.

The determination of these\u000d\u000a      costs, referred to as the periodic review, occurs every five years\u000d\u000a      and, given the structure of the rail industry in Britain, effectively\u000d\u000a      amounts to a review of the costs incurred by Network Rail. In contrast to\u000d\u000a      other regulated utilities, previous periodic reviews (prior to 2008) did\u000d\u000a      not assess the efficiency of Network Rail against external benchmarks.\u000d\u000a      Recognising this gap in knowledge, ITS Leeds was contracted in 2005 by ORR\u000d\u000a      to develop two international benchmarking studies.\u000d\u000a    Econometric modelling &#8212; efficiency studies\u000d\u000a    Between 2005 and 2008, researchers from ITS Leeds carried out new\u000d\u000a      research funded by the ORR to investigate the cost and efficiency of the\u000d\u000a      rail system in Britain relative to its international peers. Employing\u000d\u000a      advanced time-varying efficiency modelling techniques, Dr Andrew Smith\u000d\u000a      identified drivers of rail infrastructure costs, and the relative\u000d\u000a      efficiency of rail infrastructure managers (IMs) around the world [1; iii]\u000d\u000a      using a unique panel dataset of 13 European rail infrastructure managers\u000d\u000a      collected by the International Union of Railways. This work exposed a\u000d\u000a      substantial efficiency gap between Network Rail and its international\u000d\u000a      peers of around 37%.\u000d\u000a    As part of this work, Smith and his colleague Phill Wheat also adapted\u000d\u000a      stochastic frontier techniques to deal with `sub-company' datasets (where\u000d\u000a      firms are sub-divided into several business units). This new approach\u000d\u000a      allowed inefficiency to be decomposed into a fixed element that applies\u000d\u000a      across the entire company (external inefficiency) and an element that\u000d\u000a      varies at the sub-company level (internal inefficiency). The `sub-company'\u000d\u000a      analysis revealed large variations in performance and practice between\u000d\u000a      regional units within Network Rail [2; iii], as well as a substantial\u000d\u000a      efficiency gap between Network Rail and its international peers.\u000d\u000a    In parallel to the above research, Wheat and Smith developed a new\u000d\u000a      international collaboration with Professor William Greene at NYU Stern\u000d\u000a      School of Business to develop statistical methods for assessing the\u000d\u000a      uncertainties associated with the estimates of inefficiency generated by\u000d\u000a      stochastic frontier methods [3; i, iii].\u000d\u000a    Econometric modelling &#8212; evaluation of policy reforms\u000d\u000a    The research referred to above is part of a larger body of rail cost\u000d\u000a      research on whole train systems (i.e. train operations as well as rail\u000d\u000a      infrastructure) conducted by ITS Leeds over many years, supported by\u000d\u000a      funding from EPSRC [i], DfT [ii] and ORR [iii]. Since 1993, ITS\u000d\u000a      researchers have carried out econometric and wider policy evaluation work\u000d\u000a      to assess the impact of competitive tendering\/franchising on costs.\u000d\u000a      Introducing competition into passenger rail, via competitive tendering,\u000d\u000a      forms an important part of the European Commission's proposals for further\u000d\u000a      reform of the European rail sector. This strand of research was the first\u000d\u000a      in the literature to demonstrate the sharp rise in train operating company\u000d\u000a      costs in Britain (previously the policy focus had been on rising\u000d\u000a      infrastructure costs); see for example [4]. Reference [5] found that a key\u000d\u000a      reason behind rising train operating company costs in Britain was the\u000d\u000a      franchising body's decision to place operators in financial distress on\u000d\u000a      \"cost-plus\" type management contracts for extended periods.\u000d\u000a    Research team with current title\/grade and period of employment\u000d\u000a    Professor Chris Nash (Lecturer, 1975-88; Senior Lecturer, 1988-89;\u000d\u000a      Professor, 1989-date) Dr Andrew Smith (Lecturer, 2004-11; Senior Lecturer,\u000d\u000a      2011-date) Phill Wheat (Research Officer, 2005-08; Research Fellow,\u000d\u000a      2008-10; Senior Research Fellow, 2010-date)\u000d\u000a    Key grants 1998-2013\u000d\u000a    i.

Explicit references to the\u000a      research cited here are found in Units 3.3.2 and 3.5.6 of WebTAG, and have\u000a      been retained in all updates of these units since 2008 [D]. Unit 3.3.2,\u000a      regarding appraisal of noise, refers to work by Nellthorp et al. [7] as\u000a      the basis for calculating official values of traffic noise. Mackie et\u000a      al.'s report [3] led directly to the re-setting of official UK appraisal\u000a      values for changes in travel time which are still used today; Unit 3.5.6\u000a      on the value of travel time refers directly to [3] stating: \"Values\u000a        for non-working time are....based on research conducted by ITS for DfT\u000a        reported in 2003\". Since compliance with WebTAG is mandatory for\u000a      major scheme appraisals, the ITS Leeds work has influenced the appraisal\u000a      of all major road and transport schemes submitted for funding approval\u000a      to\/by DfT since 2008; this impact is corroborated by the DfT [E]. When the\u000a      DfT undertook the `New Approach to Appraisal (NATA) Refresh' review in\u000a      2009, Mackie chaired the Peer Review panel of academics and practitioners.\u000a    PDFH and rail industry regulation\u000a    The PDFH [C] contains the officially recommended demand forecasting\u000a      procedures of the rail industry in Great Britain. Research which leads to\u000a      changes to its recommended parameters therefore impacts on real world\u000a      decision making. ITS Leeds work on understanding the causes of trends in\u000a      rail travel [5] has underpinned the recommended elasticities to GDP in the\u000a      2002, 2005, 2009 and 2013 versions of PDFH. The latest update of PDFH in\u000a      2013 also uses generalised journey time (GJT) elasticities from [2]. These\u000a      GJT elasticities entail a significant departure from previous values,\u000a      impacting upon demand forecasts of changes to not only journey time,\u000a      service frequency and through-train provision, but also to other\u000a      elasticities derived from the GJT elasticities, such as crowding,\u000a      reliability, accessibility to stations and rolling stock. In addition, a\u000a      recent ITS Leeds review informed by [6] has led to major changes in the\u000a      parameters used to forecast changes in reliability; these updated\u000a      parameters have been implemented within the Office of Rail Regulation's\u000a      2013 update to Schedule 8, affecting millions of pounds of compensation\u000a      payments concerning train punctuality. Finally, ITS Leeds created the\u000a      DfT's Strategic Fares Model, and updated it in 2010 and 2013; this is used\u000a      to inform how rail fares in Britain are regulated and was subsequently a\u000a      feature of PDFH [iv]. ATOC's letter of corroboration [F] states that: \"ITS\u000a        has played a leading role in developing the body of evidence and the\u000a        framework contained within the PDFH, which is a key component of the\u000a        commercial and regulatory framework of the rail sector\".\u000a    An Illustrative Example - High Speed 2 (HS2)\u000a    The valuation and forecasting strands described above come together in\u000a      the economic appraisal of the HS2 rail project. The demand forecasting and\u000a      economic appraisal of this project has been consciously set up to be\u000a      compliant with PDFH and WebTAG. So, for example, the demand growth over\u000a      time is influenced by Wardman's work on GDP elasticities [5], the\u000a      modelling of reliability benefits and crowding relief on the West Coast\u000a      Main Line by Batley et al. [6], the valuation of non-work travel time\u000a      savings by Mackie et al. [3], and the valuation of noise by Nellthorp et\u000a      al. [7]. These pieces of work undertaken at ITS Leeds all influence the\u000a      assessment of value for money of HS2 [G], and research on the value of\u000a      travel time is a particular focus of the strategic case for HS2 [H].\u000a    World Bank toolkit\u000a    The ITS Leeds work for UK government and industry has provided the\u000a      foundation for more internationally-focused work which has extended the\u000a      reach of the research impacts. In 2003, ITS was commissioned by the World\u000a      Bank to develop a transport appraisal toolkit, which draws heavily on ITS\u000a      research outputs. This toolkit has been available to consultants around\u000a      the world from 2003 to date [A]. The responsible officer in the World Bank\u000a      states that the toolkit \"...has been instrumental in improving the\u000a        quality of economic evaluation in the transport sector in the World\u000a        Bank. Over the period 2008-12 there were 261 investment projects\u000a        financed by the World Bank either in the transport sector or with a\u000a        substantial transport component. These Guidelines made a substantive\u000a        contribution to improving the quality of the economic evaluation of\u000a        these projects' [I].\u000a    European Cost-Benefit Analysis\u000a    In 2008, the European Commission adopted its Guide to Cost-Benefit\u000a      Analysis of Investment Projects [B], incorporating the methods and values\u000a      developed by the HEATCO project. The ITS Leeds research has therefore\u000a      served as a reference point for value of time calculations in appraisals\u000a      of trans-European network projects. The same values are also recommended\u000a      for calculating congestion costs in the `Handbook on estimation of\u000a      external costs in the transport sector' [J], co- financed by the European\u000a      Commission.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken by the Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) at the\u000a      University of Leeds from 1997 to 2013 has played a key role in developing\u000a      the methods and evidence base for demand forecasting and economic\u000a      appraisal in transport. The primary impact of this research has been\u000a      changes to official guidance Manuals, which are prescribed to scheme\u000a      promoters, operators, consultants and other agents. In applying these\u000a      Manuals, a secondary research impact has been to improve the quality of\u000a      transport decision-making and Value for Money (VfM) of public expenditure.\u000a      Against this background, ITS Leeds research has achieved the following\u000a      impacts throughout the period 2008 to 2013 (and ongoing):\u000a    \u000a      The UK Department for Transport's WebTAG appraisal guidelines have\u000a        specified monetary valuations of travel time savings and traffic noise\u000a        directly from our research.\u000a      The UK rail sector's Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook, which is\u000a        the industry Manual, has specified key parameter values directly from\u000a        our econometric and review work.\u000a      Extending the reach of the impacts from the UK to worldwide, the ITS\u000a        Leeds research has also been exploited in the appraisal processes of the\u000a        World Bank and European Commission.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    University of Leeds\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Leeds (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Leeds","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007795}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

For example:\u000a    \u000a      strategic business planning is critically dependent upon evidence\u000a        concerning the responsiveness (or elasticity) of demand to economic\u000a        activity and other external factors;\u000a      routine transport planning is reliant upon estimates of market\u000a        responsiveness to attributes such as price, journey time and service\u000a        quality;\u000a      project appraisal requires not only demand forecasts, but also\u000a        valuations of time and other service attributes, to allow economic\u000a        evaluation and help determine the social value for money;\u000a      environmental assessment requires values of impacts based on evidence\u000a        of willingness to pay.\u000a    \u000a    Through the period 1997 to 2013, ITS Leeds has made notable contributions\u000a      to the evidence base on what drives changes to travel demand, and on the\u000a      valuation of travel and environmental attributes.\u000a    The value of travel time\u000a    The single most important parameter in transport appraisal is the value\u000a      of travel time savings. In 1998, Wardman was the first academic worldwide\u000a      to employ meta-analysis to synthesise and re-evaluate Stated Preference\u000a      (SP) and Revealed Preference (RP) valuations of travel times from hundreds\u000a      of UK studies; he has systematically updated this analysis as new\u000a      valuations have emerged [1; i]. Wardman has also extended the scope of the\u000a      meta-analysis work to cover time elasticities as distinct from valuations\u000a      [2], and to derive values of other aspects of service quality such as\u000a      punctuality and crowding [iv]. Wardman's results were central to the 2003\u000a      ITS Leeds report by Mackie et al. for the Department for Transport [3;\u000a      ii], which derived functional relationships between values of time and the\u000a      size and sign of time savings, distance and income, and provided the\u000a      Department with revised values of time, waiting time multipliers and GDP\u000a      elasticities.\u000a    As part of the EU-funded HEATCO project (2004-06), ITS Leeds led the\u000a      analysis of data and the development of methods to calculate the value of\u000a      time savings at a European level. This work was conducted by Shires and de\u000a      Jong [4; v], and extended the meta-analysis approach of Wardman from a UK\u000a      to a European context. The estimated regression equations were applied to\u000a      provide values of travel time for each EU country, by travel purpose and\u000a      mode. Such values can be used as best-estimate values for countries where\u000a      evidence on values of travel time is lacking; for example, they have been\u000a      used in project assessments for Romania and Bulgaria.\u000a    Understanding the demand for rail services\u000a    ITS Leeds has employed two research methods - namely major reviews and\u000a      econometric analysis - in the search for better understanding of the\u000a      determinants of rail passenger demand. With regards to the first method,\u000a      Wardman has delivered the largest ever meta-analysis of fare elasticities\u000a      (2011), as well as reviews of rolling stock (2001) and crowding (2011)\u000a      valuations. With regards to the second method, Wardman (2006) estimated\u000a      the effect of GDP and other external factors on rail demand [5; iii, iv] -\u000a      the GB railway industry had hitherto struggled to understand the growth in\u000a      railway demand - whilst Batley (2011) remains the only published study\u000a      that has directly estimated the impact of punctuality on rail demand [6;\u000a      iv].\u000a    The environmental value of transport investments\u000a    Research led by Nellthorp in 2005 extended the scope of transport\u000a      appraisals to include the valuation of environmental impacts from\u000a      transport, in the form of road and rail noise. This was collaborative\u000a      research involving the Universities of East Anglia (Day) and Loughborough\u000a      (Bristow). Nellthorp used a technique called the `benefit transfer method'\u000a      which allowed time- and location-specific data from a model of house\u000a      prices in Birmingham (provided by Day) to be `generalised' for any\u000a      location in the UK at any time.

We work with real\u000a      sites and use science to address complex practical problems. We have\u000a      developed close\u000a      relationships with industry and the regulator (the Environment Agency)\u000a      including, for example,\u000a      Visiting Professors and secondments from Shell, Environment Agency, and\u000a      consultancies such as\u000a      AEAT and Sirius. With these partners, we created and led an EPSRC-funded Network\u000a        on Natural\u000a        Attenuation in Groundwater and Soils (NNAGS; 1998-2001),\u000a      which led to policy documents,\u000a      economic impacts and training [see quote from S1 below].\u000a    Four inter-related types of impact are described here: (1) changes in\u000a      professional practices, (2)\u000a      creation and application of national policy, (3) national and\u000a      site-specific economic impacts, and (4)\u000a      influencing European industrial practice.\u000a    (1) Changes in UK professional practice. The Environment Agency\u000a      funded a Fellowship for\u000a      Thornton to work on natural attenuation research, policy development and\u000a      training (1999-2003).\u000a      During the Fellowship, he helped create their guidance document (see\u000a      below) and delivered 20\u000a      training events to over 200 staff across the UK. Since then, we have\u000a      delivered virtually all the\u000a      professional training on Natural Attenuation in the UK, giving 24 CPD\u000a      courses on Natural\u000a      Attenuation and Risk Assessment, and including specialist modules in our\u000a      Contaminant\u000a      Hydrogeology MSc. From 1999-2013 we have trained ~100 students and ~300\u000a      CPD delegates in\u000a      these fields. We also gave 3 courses in China to ~100 delegates, and\u000a      inspired the inclusion in a\u000a      Chinese textbook of a major section (1\/8 of book) on natural attenuation;\u000a      the book has already had\u000a      26 printings [S5].\u000a    (2) Creation and application of national policy. We used our\u000a      research to help write two new\u000a      policy documents in 2000, which remain in force. They enable and encourage\u000a      the appropriate use\u000a      of Natural Attenuation as a management strategy for contaminated land\u000a      through the use of\u000a      science-based investigation, assessment and monitoring of field sites. The\u000a      Environment Agency\u000a      says:\u000a    \"With regard to research into natural attenuation (NA) of pollutants\u000a        and development of practice\u000a        in the use of monitored natural attenuation (MNA) as a remediation\u000a        option it seems undeniable\u000a        that the University of Sheffield played a pivotal role in the UK. The\u000a        strong links that were made\u000a        between Sheffield and the Environment Agency (and other regulators),\u000a        industry (small and\u000a        large) and indeed research groups in other academic institutions played\u000a        a major part in this.\u000a    Your work at Four Ashes on the biodegradation of phenol and related\u000a        compounds was\u000a        instrumental in getting Environment Agency buy-in to the idea of natural\u000a        attenuation as a\u000a        serious component of site management. The outputs from that work\u000a      [examples given above,\u000a      R1, R2, R3, R5, R6] and the subsequent network NNAGS led to a range of\u000a        Agency guidance\u000a        and policy documents, most obviously the R&amp;D Publication 95\u000a        \"Guidance on the Assessment\u000a        and Monitoring of Natural Attenuation of Contaminants in Groundwater\".\u000a        This in turn influenced\u000a        our strategic \"Policy and Practice for the Protection of Groundwater\"\u000a        that sets out Agency\u000a        thinking on groundwater protection. Both of these documents are widely\u000a        used, within the\u000a        Agency on a daily basis and by our customers in industry to understand\u000a        our regulatory needs.\u000a        R&amp;D Publication 95 has stood the test of time and I estimate it\u000a        helps to inform remediation\u000a        decisions on dozens of sites per year at the current time.\" [S1].\u000a    (3) Site-specific and national economic impacts. Financial\u000a      information on individual sites is\u000a      difficult to obtain due to commercial confidentiality. However we are able\u000a      to present information\u000a      from one of our research sites, from one major land owner, and a national\u000a      survey, as follows:\u000a    \u000a      At Site A, where many research projects were based, the owners are\u000a        prepared to give\u000a        information on the multi-part clean-up operation they implemented in\u000a        2009. The design drew\u000a        significantly on our research-based understanding of the inhibiting\u000a        effects of contaminant\u000a        toxicity on biodegradation in the aquifer [R1, R2, R3, R5] and our\u000a        research-based assessment\u000a        that natural attenuation would only occur satisfactorily under specific\u000a        conditions. This design\u000a        has saved &#163;1M per year between 2009-2013, compared with the cost of the\u000a        alternative full\u000a        pump and treat operation [S3].\u000a      An owner of 50 large problem sites has stated that Natural Attenuation\u000a        plays a significant role\u000a        in reducing risk and remediating 11 of the 14 sites where it is taking\u000a        action. It has analysed the\u000a        cost-benefit of Monitored Natural Attenuation in comparison to more\u000a        aggressive remediation on\u000a        3 of these sites and found that the cost avoided is at least &#163;20M [S2].\u000a      CL:AIRE, the industry's knowledge exchange group, estimates that\u000a        Monitored Natural\u000a        Attenuation was formally adopted for about 3% of site remediations in\u000a        2008-12. Through a\u000a        survey of consultants active in contaminated land and groundwater,\u000a        CL:AIRE derives very\u000a        conservative estimates for the period 2008-12 that Natural Attenuation\u000a        was adopted as the\u000a        remedial strategy on at least 120 sites per year, with a typical saving\u000a        of &#163;166k per site, i.e. a\u000a        total saving of at least &#163;100M since 2008 [S2].\u000a    \u000a    (4) Influencing European industrial practice. CONCAWE, the\u000a      association of almost all the oil\u000a      refining companies in the EU, Norway and Switzerland, has stated \"...\u000a        research on monitored\u000a        natural attenuation undertaken at Sheffield University over the past\u000a        decade has had a significant\u000a        beneficial impact on industry good practice issued by CONCAWE, and on\u000a        the practices of its\u000a        member companies. ... In financial terms alone, the cost savings to our\u000a        industry in Europe\u000a        associated with the use of MNA solutions instead of intensively\u000a        engineered solutions, is probably in\u000a        the order of hundreds of millions Euros during the period 2008 to 2012\"\u000a      [S4].\u000a    Overall, the policy and practice changes that resulted from our\u000a      research have led in the census\u000a      period to:\u000a    \u000a      Savings of typically &#163;166K per site, and up to several million pounds\u000a        on large and complex\u000a        sites\u000a      A total saving in the UK of at least &#163;100M\u000a      Savings in Europe in the oil sector alone of several hundred million\u000a        Euros.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research on the natural processes that reduce pollutant\u000a      concentrations in the subsurface has\u000a      enabled the UK to adopt \"Natural Attenuation\" as a management policy and\u000a      has changed\u000a      professional practice at many contaminated sites. The massively reduced\u000a      costs of this approach\u000a      over active clean-up of sites in 2008-13 has saved a minimum of &#163;100M for\u000a      the UK. Our research\u000a      has also influenced European practice, saving hundreds of millions of\u000a      Euros. The beneficiaries are\u000a      typically chemical industries of all sizes, from refineries to small\u000a      repackaging plants and petrol\u000a      station owners, but also local authorities and the State in cases where\u000a      they would bear the cost of\u000a      clean-up.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000a    University of Sheffield\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sheffield (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sheffield","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007157}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    [**denotes best indicators of quality of underpinning research]\u000a    \u000a[R1] **S.F.

In the UK alone, there are over 100,000 sites\u000a      polluted by organic\u000a      chemicals which pose environmental and health risks. Because of the\u000a      complexities of working in\u000a      the subsurface, the typical cost of an active clean-up is &#163;500,000; the\u000a      situation in the rest of the\u000a      world is similar or worse. If we can reliably predict that Natural\u000a      Attenuation will reduce pollutant\u000a      concentrations enough, active clean-ups and the associated costs can be\u000a      avoided, reducing\u000a      businesses' liabilities and increasing the value of their land holdings.\u000a      Our research has enabled the\u000a      Environment Agency to formally adopt Natural Attenuation as an acceptable\u000a      risk management\u000a      approach, saving significant national resources; the revolution is to not\u000a      try and remove all the\u000a      pollution as was being done in the USA in the multi-billion dollar\u000a      approach under the Superfund\u000a      programme, but to recognise that natural processes can predictably reduce\u000a      risk once these\u000a      processes can be defined and quantified.\u000a    Supported by successive EPSRC Platform Grants (1999-2004, 2004-09) and\u000a      funding from\u000a      EPSRC, NERC, Environment Agency, BBSRC, EU and industry, and using a\u000a      combination of field\u000a      investigation, laboratory experimentation and numerical modelling, we\u000a      investigated the processes\u000a      that occur in groundwater pollution plumes containing high concentrations\u000a      of multiple pollutants.\u000a      We described the multiple, spatially variable, biodegradation processes,\u000a      created a conceptual\u000a      model of the geochemistry and microbiology of these processes [R1],\u000a      validated this through\u000a      laboratory experiments and numerical modelling [R2] and developed\u000a      theoretical frameworks to\u000a      interpret these at different scales [R3]. We showed that biogeochemical\u000a      gradients at the fringes of\u000a      pollution plumes provide a range of conditions in which rapid\u000a      biodegradation occurs, and thereby\u000a      demonstrated that solute transport by transverse dispersion is often the\u000a      key factor in controlling\u000a      plume length [R4].

Using the testing, simulation and design tools\u000a      developed in our research projects since 1998, FSDL has enabled UK stadia\u000a      operators and overseas clients to comply with regulations ensuring safety\u000a      and fitness for purpose. As an example, for the London 2012 Olympic\u000a      Velodrome [S1] (on behalf of Expedition Engineering, 2009) FSDL used VSATS\u000a      and applied the new, at the time untested in practice, stadia design\u000a      guidance [R1]. This independent assessment enabled a saving of 400 tonnes\u000a      of steel and was essential for the purposes of Category 3 performance\u000a      based design compliance due to the inherent low natural frequency of the\u000a      stands [S1].\u000a    \"using this approach allowed us to have confidence in a solution which\u000a        saved 400 tonnes of steel over using traditional design methods\"\u000a      [S1]\u000a    \"without the involvement of FSDL and the fundamental research\u000a        undertaken by your research group..., the dynamic performance of the\u000a        lightweight seating deck would have been much more difficult to justify\"\u000a      [S1]\u000a    Floors:\u000a    In 2011 FSDL applied our research [R1, R2, R5] based ambient vibration\u000a      testing technology to identify modal properties and vibration environment\u000a      being experienced in the multi-$bn Seagate disk drive production facility\u000a      in Singapore (opened 2007).

These simulations predicted the\u000a      behaviour observed and provided the operator with a clear understanding of\u000a      how to tackle the problem. Based on Seagate's annual turnover of $12bn and\u000a      figures and opinion of the Seagate specialist [S2] annual production loss\u000a      of the order $10m appears to have been mitigated by the interventions.\u000a    \"Brownjohn's vibration work allowed the Seagate engineering staff to\u000a        be ahead of the production juggernaut (for once), and not underneath the\u000a        beast\" [S2]\u000a\u0009\"to this day we are still building on Prof. Brownjohn's\u000a        original modelling and have made detailed plans for some structural\u000a        reinforcements in the specific areas of greatest sensitivity ... we owe\u000a        a great debt to this theoretical work apparently all done before one\u000a        pile was bored for this building\"[S2]\u000a    \"if production delays are experienced, that if measured in days, would\u000a        result in the loss of revenue measured in tens of millions of dollars\"\u000a        [S2]\u000a    From 2005 we applied our research [R2] based expertise to diagnose and\u000a      assess extreme low vibration performance of the foundation systems for the\u000a      new Orion high power laser facility at the [text removed for publication].\u000a      Successful operation of the &#163;100m facility relies on minute positional\u000a      tolerances for multiple laser reflections; our vibration measurements\u000a      (conducted 2009) showed these were not exceeded. The facility has now been\u000a      successfully commissioned [S3].\u000a    In a sequence of R&amp;D projects between 2009 and 2013, FSDL was engaged\u000a      by Yorkon, the leading UK off-site construction specialist, to apply\u000a      research [e.g. R1, R3, R4, R5] and resolve a key problem of liveliness of\u000a      their ultra-light building flooring systems under pedestrian-induced\u000a      dynamic loading. As a result of this 4-year work, Yorkon's new Pioneer\u000a      modular building system was developed featuring an order of magnitude\u000a      lower dynamic responses of its floors. This was achieved by discovering\u000a      and exploiting the beneficial effects of the novel pre-installed\u000a      lightweight concrete floor and vertical partitions. With the Pioneer\u000a      system, Yorkon moved decisively into quality public buildings market, such\u000a      as schools and hospitals. After investing [text removed for publication]\u000a      into this R&amp;D, a significant proportion of Portakabin Group annual\u000a      sales (&#163;30m) are now featuring the Pioneer flooring [S4].\u000a    Industrial Chimneys:\u000a    In 2008, the flue gas exhaust stack (chimney) at Rugeley Power Station\u000a      was suffering enhanced vortex shedding due to up-wind construction of a\u000a      replacement chimney. As the wind-induced sway (predicted by the operator)\u000a      could have resulted in structural failure and collapse, FSDL were\u000a      commissioned to monitor the performance of the old chimney and its tuned\u000a      mass damper. The damper was designed by Multitech (France) to reduce the\u000a      vibration to levels that would not compromise operation of the power\u000a      station. Remote monitoring technology developed in our research on the\u000a      Tamar Bridge study was adapted to track the performance of the\u000a      chimney\/damper system to the power station staff in real time. The\u000a      monitoring system clearly demonstrated that the damper worked and removed\u000a      any safety concerns [S5]. Since 2009, FSDL has operated a more\u000a      sophisticated monitoring system on a chimney at the Sellafield Nuclear\u000a      facility. The system enables the site operator to comply with stringent\u000a      safety requirements avoiding the need to interrupt site operation.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research in the Department of Civil and Structural Engineering at the\u000a      University of Sheffield on dynamic performance and vibration\u000a      serviceability has contributed to internationally applied guidance on\u000a      building serviceability for floors, buildings, stadia and other structures\u000a      and has led to the spin-out Full Scale Dynamics Ltd (FSDL).

Reynolds (Professor, joined Sheffield 1998) extended this\u000a      research to dynamic performance of grandstands and developed active\u000a      vibration control systems. Brownjohn (Professor, joined Sheffield 2005)\u000a      brought in expertise on dynamic performance of tall and long structures\u000a      over wide ranges of time and length scales. In 2008 Pavic, Reynolds and\u000a      Brownjohn founded the Sheffield University spinout company Full Scale\u000a      Dynamics Ltd (FSDL) as a delivery mechanism for impact of the research.\u000a      Racic (Lecturer, joined Sheffield 2011) added expertise in experimental\u000a      characterisation and mathematical modelling of dynamic loading of\u000a      structures induced by active individuals, groups and crowds of people.\u000a    Our research led to novel approaches to management, design and in-situ\u000a      dynamic performance assessment of large civil infrastructure with respect\u000a      to fitness for purpose with complimentary attention to safety, comfort and\u000a      economy. Our research was partly funded via the award of an EPSRC platform\u000a      grant in 2009 (EPSRC EP\/G061130\/1), the first of its kind for this area of\u000a      civil and structural engineering research in the UK.\u000a    Our researchers capitalised on technology and methodologies for modal\u000a      testing typically applied to mechanical and aerospace structures, such as\u000a      ground vibration testing and finite element model updating of prototype\u000a      aircraft and transferred it to civil structure applications [R1]. Civil\u000a      structures differ substantially from mechanical structures in materials\u000a      and scale as well as in level and nature of vibrations. What worked well\u000a      in controlled laboratories had to be adapted through a series of research\u000a      projects (GR\/L68742\/01, GR\/S14924\/01) to work in open space environments\u000a      with challenging environmental and operational conditions and unusual\u000a      signal to noise ratios. Within these research projects we developed\u000a      systems-engineered tools and procedures that combine artificial forcing\u000a      and ambient excitation and linked simulations to assess fitness for\u000a      purpose of grandstands, floors [R1], bridges and vibration-sensitive\u000a      facilities worldwide. Due to this research and application of knowledge to\u000a      real-world issues and applications, we generated the world's largest\u000a      database of operational performance of floors, stadia and footbridges.\u000a      Since 2005, we adapted capability for ambient vibration measurements with\u000a      applications to `operational modal analysis' and assessment of extreme low\u000a      vibration environments [R2]. These unique experimental capabilities have\u000a      formed the core that links design, analysis, simulation and evaluation of\u000a      performance in commercial (FSDL) projects e.g. for Yorkon and Stoke\u000a      Mandeville hospital retrofit.\u000a    We developed motion capture and force measurement facilities and used\u000a      them to create the world's largest database of ground reaction force and\u000a      to develop new models of jumping and walking [R3]. This was necessary to\u000a      address deficiencies in the existing human dynamic load models used in\u000a      standard design practice. Our research (in collaboration with University\u000a      of Manchester) has also provided valuable data on the effects of\u000a      perceptible structural vibrations on loads generated by spectators bobbing\u000a      on grandstands [R4]. This research was used to validate our contributions\u000a      to design guidance, and by FSDL to predict performance for pedestrian and\u000a      crowd-loaded structures.\u000a    Based on our research, we created bespoke software, Vibration\u000a      Serviceability Assessment Tools (VSATs) [R5], now used by industry in\u000a      performance-based design and assessment of footbridges, floors and\u000a      grandstands. VSATs links experimentally and numerically derived structural\u000a      dynamic properties and applies a range of loading from design guides and\u000a      our research is now heavily relied upon by FSDL as a primary tool for\u000a      structure serviceability evaluation.\u000a    We developed capabilities for remote structural monitoring of\u000a      grandstands, long span bridges and buildings incorporating automated\u000a      operational modal analysis for the first time in any Civil structure.

A key outcome of this work was the development of a new\u000d\u000a        technique which permitted problems to be tackled which were larger, by\u000d\u000a        several orders of magnitude, than those described in existing literature\u000d\u000a        [R2].\u000d\u000a      Gilbert and Smith then secured EPSRC grant funding in 2004 [G2] to\u000d\u000a        explore the potential for mathematical optimisation techniques to be\u000d\u000a        applied to a wide range of challenging analysis and design problems.\u000d\u000a      One challenging analysis problem, which had remained unsolved for\u000d\u000a        decades, involves automatically identifying the geometry of potential\u000d\u000a        collapse mechanisms in geotechnical and other constructions. Smith and\u000d\u000a        Gilbert were able to show that `Layout Optimisation' techniques could be\u000d\u000a        used to solve this problem, though in this case identifying the layout\u000d\u000a        of discontinuities defining the failure mechanism (`Discontinuity Layout\u000d\u000a        Optimisation', DLO) [R3].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The benefit of the rigorous numerical limit analysis methods developed\u000d\u000a      (e.g. those suitable for masonry bridge and geotechnical applications) is\u000d\u000a      that a very wide variety of potential failure mechanisms can be rapidly\u000d\u000a      evaluated, far larger than can be considered by hand or when using ad-hoc\u000d\u000a      search methods.\u000d\u000a    In the case of DLO, on a desktop PC upwards of two to the power of a\u000d\u000a        billion possible layouts of discontinuities defining a failure\u000d\u000a      mechanism can be considered. As the blocks of material between\u000d\u000a      discontinuities can subsequently be identified, DLO effectively for the\u000d\u000a      first time fully automates the process of identifying the geometry of\u000d\u000a      potential collapse mechanisms [R3], and can be extended to treat a wide\u000d\u000a      variety of practical problems. Furthermore, unlike finite element based\u000d\u000a      alternatives, DLO can inherently handle singularities in stress and\/or\u000d\u000a      displacement fields. Since these are common features of most collapse\u000d\u000a      mechanisms, this means that solutions to real-world problems can be\u000d\u000a      obtained much more rapidly than before, giving engineers a powerful new\u000d\u000a      analysis and design tool.\u000d\u000a    [G1] Network Rail Sponsorship of EPSRC Studentship: `Computational limit\u000d\u000a      analysis of concrete and masonry bridges', Investigator: Gilbert, M.,\u000d\u000a      2001-04.

It has also had an\u000a      impact on policy and practice within the water sector. The impact is based\u000a      on a fundamentally new concept to describe the processes of discolouration\u000a      in drinking water distribution systems, together with the delivery of\u000a      operational management tools. The impact of the research has been well\u000a      appreciated by [text removed for publication], as evidenced by the\u000a      following quotes:\u000a    \"...the conceptual approach and resulting tools and techniques from\u000a        the discolouration research from the University of Sheffield have\u000a        contributed to a step change in culture and practice in the [text\u000a        removed for publication]\" [S1, [text removed for publication]].\u000a    \"...provide testimonial to the impact of the University of Sheffield\u000a        discolouration research... ranging from a shift in general perception of\u000a        the processes and mechanisms involved to full scale adoption of the\u000a        PODDS modelling approaches and tools.

Particularly evident through\u000a        application of PODDS for trunk main applications.\" [S1, [text\u000a      removed for publication]].\u000a    Process:\u000a    Delivering impact from PODDS has been a long process, but has been a key\u000a      ambition from the outset. Organisations in the water sector have been\u000a      actively engaged with a view to influencing both policy and practice,\u000a      including running bespoke dissemination and training events. Notably in\u000a      2004 and 2007 invited presentations were made at UK Water Industry\u000a      Research (UKWIR) technology transfer workshops. The former was\u000a      instrumental in gaining UK water supply sector support, the latter to set\u000a      best practice standards for inclusion in Distribution Operation and\u000a      Maintenance Strategies submissions in water company Asset Management Plans\u000a      2009. Perhaps the single most influential factor in ensuring impact has\u000a      been the strategy for, and success of, industry consortium funding. This\u000a      has ensured the generation of knowledge, tools and techniques that are\u000a      practicably applicable and include wide spread programmes of fieldwork for\u000a      validation.\u000a    Impact on practice and policy:\u000a    The PODDS concept, tools and techniques feature in the majority of water\u000a      companies `Distribution Operation and Maintenance Strategies', submitted\u000a      as part of their 5 year Asset Management Plans to OFWAT. These sensitive\u000a      strategy documents are highly confidential and hence cannot be directly\u000a      referred to here [S1], however:\u000a    \"PODDS research has had an impact on all Distribution and Operation\u000a        Maintenance Strategies (DOMS) and Asset Management Plan (AMP) documents\"\u000a      [S1, [text removed for publication]].\u000a    This indicates that there has been a consequential change in culture,\u000a      planning and practice. Engineering consultancy companies use PODDS to\u000a      facilitate the design and planning of operational and maintenance\u000a      activities and for strategic asset management planning. For example [S2]\u000a      provides exemplar evidence of the use of PODDS modelling by [text removed\u000a      for publication] to help [text removed for publication] provide resilient\u000a      supply options following the flood risk to [text removed for publication]\u000a      when 350,000 customers were without mains water supplies for up to ten\u000a      days.\u000a    \"Application of PODDS-style strategies, typically by controlled flow\u000a        increases, enables networks to remain operational thereby minimising\u000a        both operational costs and discolouration risk\" [S2]\u000a    [S3] provides evidence of the development and review of a strategic\u000a      discolouration investment model by [text removed for publication] also for\u000a      [text removed for publication]. [S3] is based on the PODDS concepts, with\u000a      Boxall acting as a consultant.\u000a    Commercial software used to model distribution networks has also been\u000a      impacted. For example Infoworks&#174;, one of the most used\u000a      commercial packages in the international water industry, now calculates\u000a      and provides shear stress as per the PODDS model [S4].\u000a    When substantial undertakings with potential water quality implications\u000a      are necessary, or when `major' events occur, water companies are required\u000a      to report to the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI),demonstrating planning\u000a      and due diligence. PODDS has been a feature in such reports since 2005.\u000a      [S5] provides an example of the use of PODDS modelling to defend and\u000a      explain a recent major discolouration incident occurring in [text removed\u000a      for publication] to the DWI; 760 discolouration contacts were received\u000a      over three days, covering an area of approximately 60 square kilometres.\u000a      Initially such application of PODDS research was directly facilitated by\u000a      the researcher team. However, the knowledge and tools, with support from\u000a      bespoke training given by the PODDS research group, are now embedded\u000a      within water companies. PODDS has become part of the usual business\u000a      process within many water companies [S1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. [S6] provides an\u000a      example of the use of PODDS modelling and fieldwork (using PODDS based\u000a      equipment) by [text removed for publication] modelling team to plan major\u000a      trunk main operational activities. This work forms the basis of reports to\u000a      the DWI for undertakings relating to 20 particularly strategically\u000a      important and high risk trunk mains.\u000a    \"PODDS model was initially run so that the operational conditioned\u000a        state of the system could be determined.... Modelled discolouration\u000a        responses were then produced\" [S6].\u000a    Economic impact:\u000a    One of the few examples where a water company, Wessex Water, has been\u000a      able to make monetary saving figures available shows immediate one-off\u000a      saving of &#163;0.6M on two schemes; one with an initial estimated cost of over\u000a      &#163;1M, a 63% saving, and one where an estimated spend of &#163;2M was deferred\u000a      indefinitely by operations costing only &#163;0.04M [S7]. The 4, 7 and 6 km\u000a      lengths of the trunk mains in these examples represent a tiny percentage\u000a      of the trunk main in Wessex Water. Extrapolation of the values suggests\u000a      multi million pound savings as well as service improvements and risk\u000a      reduction [S7]. These figures relate solely to large trunk mains; economic\u000a      impacts associated with local distribution infrastructure are\u000a      un-quantified. Equivalent savings and benefits are being made by other\u000a      PODDS consortium member companies and beyond [S1, 7, 8, 9].\u000a    \"PODDS has changed the way Wessex Water thinks about managing the risk\u000a        of discoloured water... providing alternative cost effective options...\"\u000a      [S7]\u000a    \"...led to a fundamental change in the way [text removed for\u000a        publication] understands and now operates our strategic and distribution\u000a        networks in relation to the identification of risk and, therefore,\u000a        prevention of discoloured water... a key business and regulatory\u000a        driver... a key measure of the quality of service we deliver to our\u000a        customers\" [S8]\u000a    \"PODDS theory has also created a change in mind-set in our asset\u000a        strategy...directly supports the delivery of OFWATS serviceability\u000a        targets...\" [S9]\u000a    The UK water sector is widely regarded as internationally leading and\u000a      customer focused due to its privatised nature, as recognised by [text\u000a      removed for publication].\u000a    \"[text removed for publication] are internationally leading and I am\u000a        aware of international interest in and impact from the research from\u000a        countries as diverse as the Netherlands to China\" [S1, [text removed for publication]].\u000a    The adoption of PODDS concepts can be viewed as a critical factor in\u000a      helping water companies improve the service they provide to customers, by\u000a      ensuring water is clean and safe to drink. The extent and scope of\u000a      adoption of the PODDS concepts, and the implementation of tools and\u000a      management approaches that use the approach, has been a key factor in\u000a      ensuring that the quality of this essential service is delivered at least\u000a      cost. Over the five year water industry review period since 2006 the\u000a      number of consumers contacting their water supplier to report a problem\u000a      with the quality of drinking water, comprising 80% discolouration issues,\u000a      in their home or workplace has fallen by one- third [S10]. While many\u000a      factors contribute to this reduction, PODDS is recognised as one of the\u000a      most influential factors, through its widespread application and inclusion\u000a      in water company Distribution Operation and Maintenance Strategies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research, undertaken at the University of Sheffield since 2001, into the\u000a      discolouration of drinking water occurring within distribution systems has\u000a      had economic, policy and professional practice impacts on the water supply\u000a      sector since 2008. This has resulted in improved levels of service, has\u000a      safeguarded water quality delivered to the public and has delivered\u000a      substantial economic savings. For example, in one of the few cases where\u000a      monetary value is available, Wessex Water made 63% savings on two trunk\u000a      main schemes with an initial estimated cost in excess of &#163;1M. The 4 and 7\u000a      km lengths of these trunk mains represent less than 1% of the trunk mains\u000a      being impacted by our research.

Research undertaken exclusively at the\u000a      University of Sheffield since 2001 has proposed, developed, validated and\u000a      applied a novel approach to the conceptual and practical understanding of\u000a      discolouration in drinking water distribution networks. This has led to\u000a      new operational and management strategies and has seen the development of\u000a      the PODDS model for the Prediction and management Of Discolouration in\u000a      Distribution Systems. The research initially proposed a unique concept for\u000a      understanding discolouration in potable water distribution networks.\u000a      Rather than considering gravity driven sediment transport processes, as in\u000a      river environments, PODDS considers the build-up of discolouration\u000a      material on pipe walls as cohesive layers and describes how these layers\u000a      interact with hydraulic conditions to dictate material behaviour. This\u000a      step change has its basis in the analysis and characterisation of material\u000a      responsible for discolouration undertaken by Saul, Skipworth and Boxall.\u000a      This initial analysis was fundamental to the 3-year PODDS 1 project funded\u000a      by the EPSRC in 2001 (GR\/R14101\/01). Subsequently, a consortium of water\u000a      companies has funded, in the form of `club contracts', a further 3 rounds\u000a      of completed research PODDS II &#8212; IV, thereby illustrating the importance,\u000a      timing and impact of the research to industry.\u000a    PODDS 1, 2001-2003, included detailed research into material\u000a      characterisation, model formulation and initial validation through\u000a      fieldwork, as presented in [R1]. From 2002 onwards Boxall led the research\u000a      supported by Husband. Following the completion of PODDS 1, the benefit and\u000a      practical potential of the new approach and modelling tools were\u000a      recognised by industry and this led to PODDS II, `Realising the potential\u000a      of the PODDS model for the UK water industry', 2004-2006. This research\u000a      resulted in a national validation of the conceptual approach through\u000a      extensive field studies and the initiation of supporting controlled\u000a      laboratory based experiments to fully verify the approach [R2].\u000a      Subsequently, PODDS III, `Managing Discolouration: Research informing\u000a      practice', 2007-2009, enabled the development of risk based computational\u000a      tools, repeat testing of field sites to explore the impact of asset\u000a      deterioration, the development of an internationally leading full scale\u000a      temperature controlled laboratory facility and initial exploration of\u000a      discolouration issues associated with trunk mains. Key practical results\u000a      were published in [R3] and later these and further deterioration studies\u000a      were reported in [R4].The role and importance of discolouration in trunk\u000a      mains was recognised and led to PODDS IV, `Discolouration in trunk mains'.\u000a      2010-2013. Here attention was firmly focused on trunk main applications\u000a      with further fieldwork to understand and predict long term performance and\u000a      to inform management decisions, as reported in [R5].\u000a    When the original PODDS EPSRC funding proposal was written, the decision\u000a      was made that any software developed with public funding should be open\u000a      source. Hence there is no revenue stream associated with the software. The\u000a      PODDS modelling tool was developed and incorporated into the United States\u000a      Environmental Protection Agency freeware software, EPANET.

The Suzhou (China) plant has reduced sludge\u000a      production by 20%, CO2\u000a      emissions by 28%, and chemical use by 30% since start-up in 2012. The\u000a      research has expanded\u000a      the implementation of novel reduced-energy treatment methodologies into\u000a      the UK water industry.\u000a    a) Change in policy &amp; practice in wastewater treatment for the\u000a        global PCP industry\u000a    Newcastle's work has achieved a policy and practice change in biological\u000a      wastewater treatment\u000a      within the PCP industry, which resulted from the development of new\u000a      treatment technologies for\u000a      the industry and a changed perception of \"wastes\" to \"resources\" in the\u000a      minds of industry decision-\u000a      makers (E1, E2).\u000a    L'Oreal, a world-leader in the beauty industry has more than 70,000\u000a      employees, 41 plants, 600\u000a      patents per year and sales exceeding &#8364;22.5 billion in 2012. The company's\u000a      water consumption is\u000a      equally large, reaching 3 billion m3 (an equivalent to a city\u000a      of 130,000 people), and ~10% of all the\u000a      energy used in a typical factory goes to waste treatment when traditional\u000a      treatment processes are\u000a      used. The scale of these problems prompted L'Oreal to perform joint\u000a      research with Newcastle\u000a      University in ENERMIN, which was aimed at reducing energy consumption in\u000a      PCP wastewater\u000a      treatment (E1). This work was consistent with L'Oreal's commitment\u000a      to improving environmental\u000a      systems and reducing their carbon footprint, which is consistent with\u000a      long-term goals for their\u000a      industry. The Global Environment, Health &amp; Safety Director of L'Oreal\u000a      stated that (E2):\u000a    \"Work with colleagues at Newcastle has helped fuel our own efforts at\u000a        changing the way wastes\u000a        are viewed and handled in the PCP industry, hopefully making sustainable\u000a        energy production from\u000a        wastes a central tenet in waste management across the company and\u000a        industry. L'Oreal are\u000a        committed to an eco-responsible approach as regards the impact of its\u000a        activity and aim for\u000a        excellence in terms of environmental performance. As part of its 10-year\u000a        strategy (2005-2015) to\u000a        reduce its ecological footprint, L'Oreal has set itself an ambitious\u000a        goal for its plants to halve\u000a        greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of novel technologies from\u000a        joint work with\u000a        Newcastle will significantly contribute to this goal.\"\u000a    Following joint research, the optimal solution was AASB, which combined\u000a      anaerobic and aerobic\u000a      processes and had never been used in the PCP industry (E1). L'Oreal\u000a      stated (E2):\u000a    \"...research conducted with Newcastle between 2008 and 2012 developed\u000a        a variety of innovative\u000a        waste treatment options, including anaerobic-aerobic sequence reactors.\u000a        Newcastle laboratory\u000a        studies showed that it can reduce energy consumption by almost 70%\u000a        relative to traditional aerobic\u000a        treatment systems and still meet discharge standards. This basic reactor\u000a        configuration has now\u000a        been implemented at full-scale in the factory within L'Oreal Asia at\u000a        Suzhou, China\".\u000a    The Suzhou wastewater plant treats approximately 82,000m3 of\u000a      wastewater per year and employs\u000a      400 people. This new treatment system is designed to ultimately save\u000a      greater than 20% energy,\u000a      80% use of chemicals, reduce sludge by 70% and improve the effluent\u000a      quality by 50%. Since mid-2012,\u000a      L'Oreal has thus far reduced sludge by 20%, CO2 emissions by\u000a      28%, and the use of\u000a      chemicals by 30% (E3). Based on this success, AASB plants are under\u000a      development for other\u000a      factories elsewhere in China (E2), Indonesia and France (E3, E4),\u000a      and are being considered for all\u000a      41 L'Oreal factories around the world. The Suzhou AASB plant was awarded\u000a      the Industrial Water\u000a      Stewardship Award at the April 2013 Global Water Summit held in Seville,\u000a      Spain (E3, E4), an\u000a      event attended by 450-500 industrial world leaders and highlighted AASB to\u000a      289 different global\u000a      companies (E5).\u000a    Looking ahead to meet the company's continued global sustainable\u000a      development targets, L'Oreal\u000a      declared (E2):\u000a    \"It is anticipated that the joint work with Newcastle University will\u000a        promote the use of novel-energy-efficient\u000a\u0009\u0009technologies across industry and a positive significant impact\u000a        in sustainable industrial\u000a        treatment at a global level. This will help us towards our goals of\u000a        reduced greenhouse gas\u000a        emission, and responsible and sustainable growth.\"\u000a    b) Introduction of novel reduced-energy treatment technologies into\u000a        the UK water industry\u000a    Northumbrian Water Limited (NWL) provides water and sewerage services to\u000a      2.7 million people in\u000a      the northeast of England and water services to 1.8 million people in the\u000a      southeast of England.\u000a      NWL's collaboration with Newcastle University is central to their policy\u000a      of reducing energy\u000a      consumption and carbon emissions by developing a new generation of\u000a      low-energy wastewater\u000a      treatment processes. The Research &amp; Development Manager at NWL\u000a      stresses the importance of\u000a      Newcastle's research [E7]:\u000a    \"We value the research conducted at Newcastle which is rooted in\u000a        understanding wastewater\u000a        treatment systems at a deep and fundamental level, yet in doing so\u000a        provides solutions and\u000a        innovations at which are practical to industry.

AASB research and\u000a      development was primarily\u000a      performed by Dr P Mehnet (2008-2010), Dr SZ Ahammad (2010-2013) and Dr B\u000a      Christgen (2012-\u000a      2013) in collaboration with colleagues at L'Oreal. Further, Professor Tom\u000a      Curtis (Environmental\u000a      Engineering) at Newcastle University is translating AASB and other\u000a      low-energy technologies to\u000a      domestic wastewater treatment applications with Northumbrian Water Limited\u000a      (NWL).\u000a    Current biological waste treatment solutions often do not achieve their\u000a      full potential (P1) because\u000a      they demand too much energy or do not recover potential energy from\u000a      carbon-rich wastes (P2).\u000a      Most wastewaters are treated using aerobic biological processes where\u000a      extra oxygen is added to\u000a      accelerate organic carbon decomposition. However, aerobic systems use\u000a      large quantities of\u000a      energy. Recent Newcastle University research showed that 29% of all energy\u000a      consumed in the\u000a      water\/wastewater nexus in Northern England is used for waste aeration\u000a      alone (G4). Therefore, if\u000a      organic carbon loadings were reduced on aerobic treatment units,\u000a      significant energy savings could\u000a      be achieved. This is especially true for industrial wastes, such as the\u000a      personal care product\u000a      industry (PCP), which can contain &gt;100 times more organic carbon than\u000a      typical domestic\u000a      wastewater (G1, P3, P4).\u000a    Profs Graham and Curtis have explored innovative biological wastewater\u000a      treatment solutions at a\u000a      fundamental level since 2001 aimed at reducing energy consumption (P1).\u000a      However, it was not\u000a      until ENERMIN (G1) was awarded to Graham (with L'Oreal) that\u000a      directed research on low-energy\u000a      waste treatment technologies was explicitly pursued. The PCP industry\u000a      traditionally employed\u000a      physiochemical and aerated treatment processes, which consumed huge\u000a      quantities of energy; up\u000a      to 10% of total energy used at an operating factory (P3).\u000a    Early ENERMIN research focused on anaerobic treatment reactor designs,\u000a      passive aerobic reactor\u000a      systems, and pre-treatment options to reduce organic carbon loads to\u000a      existing aerated reactors\u000a      (P3, P4). Bench trials from 2008-2010 showed anaerobic processes\u000a      alone could not achieve\u000a      similar effluent quality as aerobic systems (50-70% versus &gt;90% organic\u000a      carbon removal; P4).\u000a      However, they showed combustible biogas could be obtained from PCP wastes,\u000a      which was\u000a      significantly correlated with acetoclastic methanogen abundances (Methanosarcinaceae)\u000a      in the\u000a      anaerobic reactors (P4). Passive aeration systems, such as sponge\u000a      reactors, also showed promise\u000a      in PCP wastewater treatment because have a low energy footprint. However,\u000a      they could only\u000a      achieve 80-85% organic carbon removal (P3). These results indicated\u000a      some active aeration was\u000a      needed, but also showed anaerobic reactors could produce biogas and reduce\u000a      organic carbon\u000a      loads. Therefore, the AASB system was conceived, which includes an\u000a      anaerobic pre-treatment\u000a      reactor followed by aerated final treatment reactors. AASB was bench and\u000a      pilot-trialled at\u000a      Newcastle and L'Oreal, and data showed AASB systems used up to 68% less\u000a      energy than aerobic\u000a      systems and achieved &gt;90% carbon removal (P4). This lead to the\u000a      construction of a full-scale\u000a      AASB treatment system by L'Oreal in Suzhou.\u000a    Parallel to ENERMIN research, EPSRC-funded research (G2-G5)\u000a      extended AASB and other low-energy\u000a      technologies to domestic wastewater treatment applications (P2, P5).\u000a      Approaches included\u000a      microbial fuel cells (2009-2012; Dr E Heidrich, Dr B Christgen), low\u000a      temperature anaerobic\u000a      digestion (2009-2012; Dr E Bowen) and low-oxygen nitrification (2006-2010;\u000a      Dr M Bellucci).\u000a      Newcastle research showed there was 17.7 to 28.7 kJ of potential energy\u000a      available per gram of\u000a      wastewater Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), which is 20% greater than\u000a      previous believed (P2).\u000a      This work showed the value of domestic wastes as an energy source had been\u000a      underappreciated,\u000a      which resulted in the pilot-scale testing of \"next generation\"\u000a      bioelectrochemical anaerobic treatment\u000a      systems for application in the UK (P5). Our successful intersection\u000a      of reduced energy use (e.g.,\u000a      AASB; P4) and increased energy potential from wastewater (P2)\u000a      has led to the development of a\u000a      new NWL-based pilot testing facility (in design) with a &#163;524K contribution\u000a      from NWL as part of\u000a      Newcastle's recently awarded EPSRC Frontiers in Engineering grant (G6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21773","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research at Newcastle University led to the invention of EKG, creating a\u000d\u000a      worldwide market for its use in designing a new range of `active'\u000d\u000a      geosynthetics.

Changing civil engineering practice and catalysing new companies\u000d\u000a    Electrokinetic Limited (EKL, www.electrokinetic.co.uk) was spun out of\u000d\u000a      Newcastle University to pioneer the commercial application of EKG products\u000d\u000a      and processes.

Furthermore, the\u000d\u000a      transport infrastructure owners and operators (Highways Agency; Network\u000d\u000a      Rail) which have adopted the new technology over more traditional\u000d\u000a      approaches now recognise the significance of EKG for cost and\u000d\u000a      environmental impact reduction in their businesses, as evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      receipt of the Highways Agency (HA) supplier recognition award in 2012 [E3]\u000d\u000a      (highlighting the important contributions made by suppliers to the HA\u000d\u000a      strategic road network).\u000d\u000a    Amey is a market leading infrastructure services provider who worked with\u000d\u000a      Newcastle University and EKL on the use of the electrokinetic remediation\u000d\u000a      technique. The Technical Director of the Amey geotechnical group commented\u000d\u000a      on the work [E4]: \"The Electrokinetic remediation technique has\u000d\u000a        been demonstrated in a pilot project for Network Rail (NR) and at\u000d\u000a        commercial scale on two highways projects for the Highways Agency (HA)\u000d\u000a        completed in 2011 and 2012 , including the Amey led Area 9 M5 J7 scheme\u000d\u000a        (approximate value &#163;975,000) which recently won several industry awards\u000d\u000a        (2013).

Revising civil engineering standards and international guidelines\u000d\u000a    The new range of EKG products has been recognized by British Standards\u000d\u000a      which led to the revision of BS 8006 (2010) covering the construction of\u000d\u000a      reinforced soil structures, specifically accepting electrokinetic\u000d\u000a      improvement of fill materials. The former Chairman of the British\u000d\u000a      Standards Committee B526\/04 Reinforced Soils supports this evidence by\u000d\u000a      commenting [E5]: \"The revised Code of Practice BS8006-1:2010\u000d\u000a        allows the use of new products such as EKGs in the construction of\u000d\u000a        reinforced soil structures used in many infrastructure projects such as:\u000d\u000a        roads, railways, airports, industrial developments and waste disposal\u000d\u000a        sites\". This revision to the Code has enabled more wide-spread\u000d\u000a      (worldwide) adoption of the technique.

The research proved that EKGs could extend the\u000d\u000a      applications of geosynthetics by adding an active\u000d\u000a      component, substantially speeding up the movement of water in clay-rich\u000d\u000a      soils. The Newcastle team achieved this by combining the electrokinetic\u000d\u000a      phenomena of electro-osmosis, electrophoresis and associated\u000d\u000a      electrokinetic functions with the traditional functions of geosynthetics\u000d\u000a      of drainage, filtration, containment and reinforcement to form\u000d\u000a      electokinetic geosynthetics (EKG). Publications were delayed until 2001 [P1]\u000d\u000a      to protect the intellectual property and enable patents to be filed.\u000d\u000a    A second EPSRC award [G2] developed the applications for EKG in\u000d\u000a      civil engineering and included several full-scale demonstration trials.\u000d\u000a      This led to an increase in the number of structural forms of EKG patented\u000d\u000a      as well as patents for their application. The main outcome of this\u000d\u000a      research established that adding an active component to a\u000d\u000a      traditional geosynthetic (such as a reinforcing element of a\u000d\u000a      pre-fabricated vertical drain) substantially speeded up construction time\u000d\u000a      and extended the range of soils that could be utilised, thus opening up\u000d\u000a      new markets for geosynthetic materials [P1, P2]. Consequently, an\u000d\u000a      EKG drain not only acts as a drain (a passive function),\u000d\u000a      but also causes water in fine grained soil to flow to the drain (an active\u000d\u000a      function) [P1, P2, P6] and EKG reinforcement increases\u000d\u000a      the strength of the soil and the bond between the\u000d\u000a      reinforcement and the soil [P2]. The field trials demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      EKGs suffered no loss in performance or `usability' when compared to\u000d\u000a      traditional forms of geosynthetics.\u000d\u000a    Following the creation of the spin-out company Electrokinetic Limited\u000d\u000a      (EKL) in 2000, research and development was conducted collaboratively\u000d\u000a      between Newcastle University EKL who were able to lever TSB funding.\u000d\u000a      Newcastle led the research effort required to develop and test new\u000d\u000a      products and techniques while EKL dealt with the commercial application of\u000d\u000a      EKG products and processes. Research concentrated on extending the\u000d\u000a      application of EKG to roadside slope stabilisation and the treatment of\u000d\u000a      large volume fluid wastes [G3, G4, P4, P5, P6]. New forms of EKG\u000d\u000a      were developed, including EKG `soil nails', EK belts (for belt filter\u000d\u000a      presses) and EK `filter bags' (for treating and disposing of small volume\u000d\u000a      fluid wastes). All of these forms and applications have been patented.\u000d\u000a      This work was led by Professor Glendinning which, as well as extending the\u000d\u000a      markets for EKGs, also refined the understanding of their functions and\u000d\u000a      added electrochemical components. This led to the definition of a new\u000d\u000a      range of EKG materials, each with unique properties which could be\u000d\u000a      controlled according to:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Materials and settings in which the EKG is used;\u000d\u000a      Physical and chemical design of the EKG;\u000d\u000a      Electrical control and operation of the EKG;\u000d\u000a      Management of the boundary conditions associated with the EKG.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Key personnel involved in this research were: Professor C J F P Jones\u000d\u000a      (1986 - 2003) who pioneered the first work at Newcastle and played a key\u000d\u000a      role in developing links with the geosynthetics industry and in\u000d\u000a      establishing the spin-out company; Professor B G Clarke (1984 -2008) who\u000d\u000a      was involved in the first two research projects and the early stages of\u000d\u000a      the spin-out; and Professor S Glendinning (1998 - current) who led the\u000d\u000a      second two research projects and who manages the interface between\u000d\u000a      research and practice.

The Director of Operations at the Coal Authority acknowledges that (S5):\u000d    \"The overall treatment process, including treatment unit type and\u000d        size, was determined by Newcastle University following research and\u000d        development by the research team between 2009 and 2012 ...\"\u000d    This will be the blueprint for schemes in the coming decades (S5).\u000d      The treatment system is a directly scaled up version of the\u000d      bioreactors developed through research (G6, G7, O4),\u000a      thus clearly linking the research and impact.\u000d    The EA is undertaking nationwide investigations (from 2012) of\u000d      mining-polluted river catchments, at a cost of &#163;1.2M (S3). The\u000d      catchments were selected directly from NU research (G3, O2).\u000a      The EA has modified its approach to monitoring based on the NU team's\u000d      recommendations in light of its research on diffuse pollution (O1,\u000d      S3). Recognising the importance of the work, both EA and CA engaged\u000d      the NU team to deliver training courses (2010 - 2011) on mining pollution\u000d      to 75 of their organisations' staff i.e. virtually all of their staff\u000d      involved in mining pollution. The CA has commented on these training\u000d      courses that \"... no other organisation has provided more technical\u000d        training to our staff ... than the Newcastle University team\" (S5).\u000d    (D) International impact on practitioners\u000d    Internationally, the Global Acid Rock Drainage (GARD) Guide was an\u000d      initiative of the world's major mining houses. The GARD Guide is the first\u000d      comprehensive international guidance document on mining pollution\u000d      management. A web-based document (http:\/\/www.gardguide.com),\u000a      as at 04\/2013 the GARD Guide had been accessed by 161,000 users, 176,000\u000d      by 06\/2013 (S6), 193,000 by 08\/2013, and 206,000 by 10\/2013. Two\u000d      members of the NU team sat on the committees that shaped both the\u000d      structure and content of the Guide (2008 - 2009), and so the team is\u000d      indirectly having a continuing impact on the practice of thousands of\u000d      professionals worldwide.\u000d    That NU was the only organisation in the world to be represented twice on\u000d      these committees (http:\/\/www.inap.com.au\/committees.htm)\u000d      is recognition by the international mining community of the impact of the\u000d      team's applied research, and a reflection of the team's unique\u000d      understanding of both technical and policy issues related to mining\u000d      pollution in Europe (S6). The multinational mining company Rio\u000d      Tinto stated that (S6):\u000d    \"...there is no question that the Newcastle University team has had a\u000d        worldwide impact on the practice of professionals in the mining sector\u000d        dealing with mine water pollution\"\u000d    The clear influence of the NU team is further made plain in Section 1,\u000d      Chapter 1 of the GARD Guide: \"The target audience is adapted from a\u000d        model developed by the PIRAMID Consortium (2003)\"; a reference to\u000d      the major output, authored by the NU team, of an EC project led by NU (http:\/\/www.imwa.info\/piramid\/files\/PIRAMIDGuidelinesv10.pdf;\u000d      G1). The GARD Guide also references the team's policy work, such as\u000d      G2 (O5).\u000d    (E) International impacts on public policy and services\u000d    Underpinned by research in Europe and the Americas (G2, G4,\u000d      O6), NU's work in the Arequipa region of Peru had impacts on public\u000d      policy and services; the team led the formation of an official advisory\u000d      group which wrote guidelines on river basin management in mining areas for\u000d      the Arequipa region, with involvement from all key stakeholders (S8).\u000d    Because of this expertise the NU team has been engaged by the Catholic\u000d      Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) Andean Programme (2012 - 2013) to\u000d      provide policy advice and support to local authorities and civil society\u000d      in one of the highest profile mining conflicts in Peru (Tintaya mine,\u000d      Espinar), and were officially accepted by the environmental working group\u000d      set up by the Prime Minister's Office (S7), with participation of\u000d      three Ministries, to resolve these issues (S7). Consequently the\u000d      team has had direct impact on the establishment of long-term monitoring\u000d      programmes, definition of regional policies overseas, and the practices of\u000d      NGOs, as recognised by CAFOD, that comments (S7):\u000d    \"Working with Newcastle University has opened a series of different\u000d        options and strategies for changing government policy and practice which\u000d        had previously been closed to NGOs\"\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Research into the characteristics and remediation of mining pollution has\u000d      had sustained and significant impacts (2008 - 2013) on environmental\u000d      policy and practice at regional, national and international scales.\u000d      Impacts, all with documentary evidence, include:\u000d    \u000d      Defining locations for engineering interventions to manage pollution\u000d        in the economically important River Tyne and its estuary (S1).\u000d      Triggering, and supporting delivery of, multi-million pound government\u000d        investment in remediation of mining pollution nationally (S2, S3, S4).\u000d      Determining design of the first large-scale `passive' metal mine\u000d        drainage treatment system ever built in the UK (S3, S5).\u000d      Ensuring European mining pollution issues are properly addressed in\u000d        production of definitive international guidelines on mining pollution\u000d        management (S6).\u000d      Shaping of public policy and practice for management of water in\u000d        mining regions of Peru and Honduras via international advisory roles (S7,\u000a          S8).\u000d    \u000d    ","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000d    Newcastle University\u000d    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Newcastle upon Tyne (University of)","InstitutionName":"Newcastle University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007799}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3947319","Name":"Arequipa"}],"References":"\u000d    Key outputs (Note: Key publications are O3, O4 and O6):\u000d    \u000a[O1] Gozzard E, Mayes WM, Potter HAB, Jarvis AP (2011) Seasonal\u000d      and spatial variation of diffuse (non-point) source zinc pollution in a\u000d      historically metal mined river catchment, UK.

Carefully designed experiments comprising\u000d      simultaneous river flow and quality measurements, with equivalent\u000d      measurements of polluting discharges, illustrated the importance of\u000d      diffuse sources of mining-related pollution and also the substantial metal\u000d      fluxes to freshwaters occurring during periods of high flow (e.g. O1).\u000a      Impacts are in Section 4(B). More detailed research on metal fluxes in the\u000d      River Tyne catchment (G5) revealed the critical role of abandoned\u000d      mine pollution in determining metal levels in estuarine sediments, with\u000d      implications for estuary dredging operations specifically, and catchment\u000d      management more generally (2009 - 2011). Sensitivities surrounding the\u000d      economic implications of the findings mean that this research is\u000d      commercial-in-confidence. Impacts are in Section 4(A).\u000d    Quantifying the scale and impacts of mine water pollution:\u000d      The first ever assessment of the scale and impacts of abandoned base metal\u000d      mines on freshwater systems of England and Wales was undertaken by the NU\u000d      team (2007 - 2009; G3), developing an impact assessment\u000d      methodology founded primarily on hydrochemical data and hosted on a GIS (O2).\u000a      This was successfully applied across the nation (2009 - 2010) to highlight\u000d      key regions affected by mining-related pollution, and continues to be used\u000d      by the Environment Agency (EA) (Section 4(B)). Careful interrogation of\u000d      the data revealed the very substantial scale of abandoned mining pollution\u000d      in England and Wales for the first time: the problem affects 7-8% of all\u000d      waters in England and Wales, and it is responsible for at least 50% of all\u000d      the metals in our freshwaters (O3).\u000d    Developing novel passive treatment systems for metal-polluted\u000d          waters: The NU team's development of sustainable (`passive')\u000d      mine water treatment systems initially investigated coal mine water\u000d      treatment (e.g. G1), but more recently the main contaminants in\u000d      abandoned base metal mine drainage have been the focus (O4, G6, G7).\u000a      The research focused on enhancing rates of bacterial sulphate reduction in\u000d      compost bioreactors in particular, and demonstrated the potential for\u000d      successful treatment in much smaller systems than previously thought\u000d      possible. Impacts are in Section 4(C).\u000d    Policy and management research in catchments impacted by mining:\u000d      Starting from experiences in the UK, the NU team worked with the European\u000d      Commission services and WWF policy unit at the interface between the Water\u000d      Framework Directive (WFD) and Directive on Mining Waste (2001 - 2004; G2),\u000a      producing the first published guidelines on management of catchments with\u000d      mining (O5), and experiencing first-hand European policy-making. In\u000d      2005 - 2010 the group continued this line of research in European projects\u000d      (e.g. G4) with groups in Peru, Chile and Bolivia. These projects\u000d      also involved the production of general guidelines in Spanish (UNESCO) and\u000d      specific policy guidelines for the research catchments (S8). Key\u000d      aspects of this research were published in O6. Impacts are in\u000d      Section 4(E).

The use of stochastic methods allows\u000d\u000a      much larger and more detailed data sets of hazards (e.g. extreme\u000d\u000a      rainfall, droughts, and wind storms) to be generated for present and\u000d\u000a      future climates providing a more robust basis for risk and reliability\u000d\u000a      assessments. These assessments include expected damages from flood,\u000d\u000a      failure of water supply and damage to infrastructure networks from\u000d\u000a      multiple environmental hazards, which inform plans and designs for\u000d\u000a      resilient infrastructure systems adapted to future climates.\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research has been achieved through two main impact\u000d\u000a      routes a) the provision of the \"Weather Generator\" (WG) software\u000d\u000a      encompassing new methods as part of the UKCP09 used for climatic risk\u000d\u000a      assessments, and b) the provision of a tailored model for water resource\u000d\u000a      planning.\u000d\u000a    a) Impact through the Weather Generator: Research at\u000d\u000a      Newcastle into stochastic rainfall models underpins the web-based WG\u000d\u000a      software [E5] technical details of which are published in the DEFRA report\u000d\u000a      [E8]. This work uses both the NSRP rainfall model [P1, P4] and methods for\u000d\u000a      downscaling future climate [P2, P3]. The WG was initially developed for\u000d\u000a      the Environment Agency (EA) funded EARWIG project and further developed\u000d\u000a      for DEFRA's official UK Climate Projections (UKCP09). The free and online\u000d\u000a      provision of WG has made new, more robust methods for risk assessment of\u000d\u000a      climate change, floods and droughts available to a wide user-base where\u000d\u000a      previously it was restricted to academic research or highly specialised\u000d\u000a      consultancy. This accessibility has resulted further in the transformation\u000d\u000a      of industry and academic best practice in design and planning of resilient\u000d\u000a      infrastructure systems across multiple sectors e.g. energy\u000d\u000a      utilities &amp; transport operators.

The CCRA informs national policy through the National\u000d\u000a          Adaptation Plan which sets out the main priorities for adaptation\u000d\u000a        for the UK;\u000d\u000a      Government Office North East commissioned Royal Haskoning to carry out\u000d\u000a        its Climate Change Adaptation study (2008) which used the WG and won the\u000d\u000a        Institution of Civil Engineers Stephenson Award for Sustainability\u000d\u000a        (2009) [E4];\u000d\u000a      Atkins, one of the world's leading design, engineering and project\u000d\u000a        management consultancies, uses the WG extensively (since 2009) to\u000d\u000a        analyse data for their clients, predominantly in the water sector. Most\u000d\u000a        notable is the UKWIR (UK Water Industry Research Ltd.) project \"Climate\u000a          Change Modelling for Sewerage Networks\" which resulted in the\u000d\u000a        provision of guidance on incorporating climate change impacts into the\u000d\u000a        modelling of sewerage networks [E2, E3]; The software tool \"WRAPT\"\u000d\u000a        (which uses WG outputs) commissioned by UKWIR is the new national water\u000d\u000a        industry standard recommendation. The principal consultant at Atkins\u000d\u000a        indicates in [E3] that the UK water industry spent over &#163;1 billion on\u000d\u000a        reducing the risk of sewer flooding between 2005 and 2010 and that this\u000d\u000a        will become more significant in the future: \"Understanding the risk\u000d\u000a          &#8212; in the current climate and under climate change projections &#8212; is\u000d\u000a          vital to ensure appropriate and timely investment. Analysis using WG\u000d\u000a          is integral to this\" [E3];\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Overall uptake of the WG can be gauged by usage statistics which show it\u000d\u000a      was run 16,132 times by 1338 unique users from 2009 to May 2013 [E5, E6];\u000d\u000a      a national portfolio of RCUK funded programmes with industrial partners\u000d\u000a      [E7] who rely on the UKCP09 e.g. the EPSRC Adaptation and\u000d\u000a      Resilience in a Changing Climate Coordination Network [E3].\u000d\u000a    b) Impacts through models for water resource planning:\u000d\u000a      Stochastic methods have been accepted as a new practice by water industry\u000d\u000a      companies and used for future investment and asset management planning of\u000d\u000a      e.g. reservoirs and water transfers. One direct beneficiary is\u000d\u000a      Southern Water (SW) whose consultants, Atkins, have specified and used\u000d\u000a      stochastic rainfall models and their outputs in driving water resource\u000d\u000a      models, subsequently used for assessing future requirements and planning\u000d\u000a      capacity and investment. The Newcastle research contribution here was in\u000d\u000a      provision of stochastic rainfall models which were refined and applied\u000d\u000a      with knowledge from climate downscaling projects [G1,G2] dealing with\u000d\u000a      droughts to develop computer models for monthly multi-site rainfall [P6]\u000d\u000a      with realistic extremes and spatial correlation needed for application\u000d\u000a      across large water resource zones under climate change conditions. SW's\u000d\u000a      management plan [E9, pg.6] describes this \"innovative approach\"\u000d\u000a      based on pioneering work with Newcastle University using \"mathematical\u000d\u000a        modelling techniques to look at alternative weather patterns and\u000d\u000a        droughts\". This much more robust approach, \"an industry first\"\u000d\u000a      [E10], to possible future drought was used to formulate SW's water\u000d\u000a      resources management plan submitted to industry regulators, Ofwat. This\u000d\u000a      planning case is valued at &#163;283.4 million as SW serves around 4 million\u000d\u000a      customers and was published in draft for consultation in May 2013 [E9,\u000d\u000a      E10].\u000d\u000a    Further developing and international impacts: simulation\u000d\u000a      methods using stochastic inputs are now becoming standard in international\u000d\u000a      insurance and re-insurance. Newcastle enjoys membership of the Willis\u000d\u000a      Research Network which provides a close relationship with Willis and their\u000d\u000a      insurance and re-insurance clients. Newcastle has developed rainfall\u000d\u000a      models to generate large-scale extreme daily rainfall fields for Willis,\u000d\u000a      who are developing a large basin flood model to be driven with ensembles\u000d\u000a      of synthetic rainfall data. Insured losses of around &#8364;400 million were\u000d\u000a      estimated from flooding in Austria due to the Danube in the last major\u000d\u000a      flood event and improved models and flood risk estimates at greater\u000d\u000a      resolution and with higher accuracy will allow significant improvement in\u000d\u000a      premium setting and avoidance of costly over-exposure. Collaborations with\u000d\u000a      partners for international WG applications are underway with Deutsche\u000d\u000a      Wetter Dienst (Germany), Global Change Impact Studies Centre (Pakistan)\u000d\u000a      and Caribbean meteorological agencies (via a Climate and\u000d\u000a      Development Knowledge Network project funded by DFID8882083).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at Newcastle University into stochastic rainfall models and\u000d\u000a      their application has transformed the practice of impact assessment of\u000d\u000a      climate change and risk assessment of environmental hazards across\u000d\u000a      multiple sectors.

The laboratory has\u000d\u000a      become known in the research community as the prime exponent of developing\u000d\u000a      and using stochastic methods in performance assessment of hydrosystems (e.g.\u000d\u000a      water resources, urban drainage). Stochastic (including \"Monte Carlo\")\u000d\u000a      approaches to modelling infrastructure and natural systems allow\u000d\u000a      performance to be assessed and optimised for conditions outside of those\u000d\u000a      observed, including future climates. The research utilised new\u000d\u000a      mathematical formulations of models to provide wider functionality and\u000d\u000a      demonstrates their utility in real-world application. The research\u000d\u000a      advances may be characterised in the following three areas:\u000d\u000a    Stochastic modelling of rainfall: developments from 1993 started\u000d\u000a      with an existing basic method, the Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulses (NSRP)\u000d\u000a      model. O'Connell initiated a research programme, with PhD student\u000d\u000a      Cowpertwait, producing key developments over the following decade\u000d\u000a      including: improving the ability to reproduce extremes [P1], extending\u000d\u000a      from single-site to space-time [P4], providing national [P2] and European\u000d\u000a      [P1] coverage. The nature of the developments was mathematical (new\u000d\u000a      analytical derivations of parameter estimates) and statistical (e.g.\u000d\u000a      robust model optimisation, and choice of intensity distribution for\u000d\u000a      reproduction of extremes).\u000d\u000a    Rainfall information for future climates: methods for downscaling\u000d\u000a      climate model outputs were developed from 1998 onwards by Kilsby [P2] and\u000d\u000a      Fowler for her PhD thesis. Climate models operate on large grid squares so\u000d\u000a      the generation of fine-scale rainfall information and properties of\u000d\u000a      extremes for future climates has been an enduring problem. This was\u000d\u000a      addressed for the first time in the UK by the Newcastle team using\u000d\u000a      atmospheric circulation patterns as predictors of rainfall in a\u000d\u000a      statistical framework [P2]. The NSRP model was further developed and\u000d\u000a      applied in this context in a series of EU projects [G1] for climate impact\u000d\u000a      assessments on water resources and flooding.\u000d\u000a    Probabilistic frameworks for climate change impact and risk\u000d\u000a        assessments: extension of the rainfall model to other variables (e.g.\u000d\u000a      temperature) was led by Kilsby in collaboration with UEA from 2006 [P5,\u000d\u000a      G5] leading to the \"Weather Generator\" (WG) used by the Environment\u000d\u000a      Agency (EA). A new era of \"probabilistic\" climate change\u000d\u000a      projections was entered in 2009 when the Met Office Hadley Centre\u000d\u000a      developed an ensemble approach to address uncertainty in the DEFRA-funded\u000d\u000a      UKCP09 programme, the first example worldwide of such projections being\u000d\u000a      available to the public. However, these are limited in that only distributions\u000d\u000a      of change are provided, so actual time series are not available,\u000d\u000a      an essential requirement for impacts modelling. DEFRA therefore\u000d\u000a      commissioned Newcastle to develop a tool to provide these essential\u000d\u000a      missing series [G2]. Newcastle was responsible for the rainfall component\u000d\u000a      and overall implementation, whilst UEA addressed the other weather\u000d\u000a      variables.

It has been widely recognised\u000a      (UKERC, DECC, ETI) that investors would only make a significant commitment\u000a      to tidal stream development after several key engineering developments had\u000a      been made including:\u000a    i) development and validation of engineering models to predict energy\u000a      yield, and hence revenue, from commercial scale farms\u000a    ii) demonstration of deployment and operation of a commercial scale\u000a      turbine,\u000a    iii) development and validation of engineering tools to enable system\u000a      refinement, and hence cost reduction,\u000a    iv) increased understanding of the environmental flows at tidal stream\u000a      sites pre- and post- deployment.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a      To ensure rapid exploitation of research findings and methods, our\u000a      research has been conducted in close collaboration with leading\u000a      engineering companies including EDF, GL-Garrad Hassan, Alstom Ocean Energy\u000a      and EON. In particular, Manchester has contributed to the national\u000a      projects PerAWaT (Performance Assessment of Wave and Tidal Array Systems)\u000a      and ReDAPT (Reliable Data Acquisition Platform For Tidal). Both projects\u000a      were commissioned by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) and focused\u000a      on the engineering topics recognised to be of major concern to potential\u000a      investors. Much of the work on these projects has been documented in peer-\u000a      reviewed technical reports that are confidential to the ETI and industrial\u000a      contributors. This well- managed approach has enabled industry\u000a      exploitation of our research in parallel with publication.\u000a    Specifically, Manchester researchers have:\u000a    \u000a      Developed experimental methods that have led to high quality\u000a        experimental data on the loading and wakes of tidal turbines in arrays.\u000a        The understanding and data from these experiments has \"contributed\u000a            to the development of GL-Garrad Hassan commercial software tool GH\u000a            Tidal Farmer\" [C]. This software enables independent\u000a        assessment of energy yield, and hence revenue, from tidal stream farms &#8212;\u000a        a key requirement of energy project investors.\u000a      Developed CFD methods for massively parallel computing to enable the\u000a        simulation of turbines and their supporting structures due to complex\u000a        tidal flows representative of a real tidal stream test site. These\u000a        methods have been implemented in the EDF open-source CFD solver\u000a        Code_SATURNE. These numerical tools are \"important to the tidal\u000a            stream industry since they allow detailed evaluation of design\u000a            options prior to field trials.\" [D]. This has reduced the\u000a        dependence of product development on full-scale field trials that\u000a        typically cost several million pounds per turbine. These methodologies\u000a        are also being used by EDF to analyse different locations and sizes of\u000a        offshore wind farms with the approach proving \"useful, as most of\u000a            our [EDF] previous work has been in CFD of power generation from\u000a            nuclear or fossil fuel source or turbo-machinery CFD, which are\u000a            quite different areas.\" [B].\u000a      Developed and conducted CFD simulations and informed field studies of\u000a        tidal stream flows to provide data \"used to develop and validate\u000a            GL-Garrad Hassan commercial software including Tidal Bladed\"\u000a        [C]. This software is a design tool for tidal turbines based on an\u000a        existing code &#8212; GH Bladed &#8212; for wind turbine design. Validation of such\u000a        models specifically for tidal stream turbines has addressed one of the\u000a        key engineering risks identified by investors.\u000a      Contributed to expert panels and management committees of national\u000a        projects. In 2008 Professor Stansby was invited to join the Severn Tidal\u000a        Power Feasibility Study expert panel on behalf of the Royal Academy of\u000a        Engineering. This appointment was based on recognised expertise in\u000a        coastal hydrodynamics including wave effects, turbulent coastal flows\u000a        and marine turbines and complemented the expertise of the five other\u000a        panel members. One option under consideration was a tidal fence or row\u000a        of tidal stream turbines. Since 2009, Manchester researchers have\u000a        contributed to the steering and technical committees of the national\u000a        industry-academia projects ReDAPT and PerAWaT commissioned by the Energy\u000a        Technologies Institute (ETI). On ReDAPT Manchester researchers are\u000a        subcontracted by the project partner EDF. These roles have been\u000a        instrumental in ensuring the effective delivery of key project outcomes\u000a        focused on development of engineering credibility to reduce investment\u000a        risk.\u000a    \u000a    Reach and Significance\u000a      Manchester's research has increased investor confidence in tidal stream\u000a      energy systems. Research outcomes have been \"critical to the\u000a          development and validation of tidal stream modelling tools\"\u000a      [A]. This includes commercial software for farm energy yield predictions\u000a      and both open-source CFD and commercial software for turbine design.\u000a      Increased understanding of array energy yield prediction methods has been\u000a      developed that \"reduces the investment risk of marine energy project\u000a          developers; this is critical to stimulating investment in early farms\u000a          to enable the industry to grow.\" [A]. CFD methods have been\u000a      developed and evaluated that have improved understanding of complex tidal\u000a      flows and their influence on turbine loading. This CFD capability has\u000a      enabled \"further de-risking of the tidal turbine design process,\u000a          providing increased turbine system robustness and commercial\u000a          attractiveness\" [A]. High quality data from CFD simulations\u000a      and from field trials informed by our research have also been used to\u000a      evaluate the GL-Garrad Hassan turbine design software Tidal Bladed.\u000a    Taken together, the models that have been developed and evaluated and the\u000a      other outcomes of the ETI projects to which we have contributed have\u000a      addressed the main engineering risks that had been identified as barriers\u000a      to investment in tidal energy. Increased investor confidence has been\u000a      demonstrated by the &#163;65m acquisition of Tidal Generation Ltd by Alstom\u000a      from Rolls Royce during 2013 [E]. This acquisition was completed following\u000a      a key outcome of the ETI ReDAPT project [F].\u000a    The findings and process of our research have therefore had a significant\u000a      impact on industrial investment in an emerging industry with recognised\u000a      value to the UK.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research has been key to the development of investor confidence in an\u000a      emerging UK tidal stream industry.

The conclusions from this research have countered orthodox views\u000d\u000a      of the responses necessary for tackling climate change.\u000d\u000a    Four headline areas where it has had a tangible impact on policy\u000d\u000a      development:\u000d\u000a    1) Cumulative emissions (carbon budgets) as a scientifically robust\u000d\u000a        basis for policy.\u000d\u000a    The insights gained from Tyndall-Manchester's comprehensive emission\u000d\u000a      scenarios attracted considerable political attention, leading to a major\u000d\u000a      conference in Westminster opened by the then government chief scientist,\u000d\u000a      Professor David King. As a result, the research was highly influential in\u000d\u000a      bringing the singular importance of carbon budgets, as opposed to\u000d\u000a      long-term targets, to the forefront of political debate [A, B].\u000d\u000a    NATIONAL IMPACT: In 2008 the Climate Change Act established the UK\u000d\u000a      Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which ultimately advised the government\u000d\u000a      to introduce carbon budgets for the UK. The Secretary of State (David\u000d\u000a      Miliband) acknowledged the \"signal contribution\" of\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester's research to the 2008 Climate Change Act [A]; and the\u000d\u000a      CCC subsequently adjusted their recommendation in line with our research\u000d\u000a      findings, suggesting an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 would be\u000d\u000a      necessary to meet UK's international commitments to 2&#176;C (as enshrined in\u000d\u000a      the Copenhagen Accord). Tyndall-Manchester research also had influence in\u000d\u000a      the Scottish parliament's formulating its own Climate Change Act.\u000d\u000a    REGIONAL IMPACT: At the regional level, Tyndall-Manchester was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by Manchester City Council (MCC) to develop carbon budgets\u000d\u000a      for the city region, subsequently adopted in the City Council's climate\u000d\u000a      change action plan, A Certain Future (2008 and 2010).\u000d\u000a    COMMERCIAL IMPACT: Research was also taken up by a leading British retail\u000d\u000a      and banking group for use in their discussions with government on the need\u000d\u000a      both for a UK climate change act and any forthcoming legislation being\u000d\u000a      premised on scientifically-informed cumulative emission budgets and not\u000d\u000a      simple 2050 targets [C].\u000d\u000a    2) The need to increase the UK carbon reduction target.\u000d\u000a    Initially through interactions with the Welsh Assembly Government\u000d\u000a      (Anderson appointed as commissioner and scientific advisor to Welsh\u000d\u000a      Government's climate change commission, 2007-date) and subsequently the UK\u000d\u000a      Committee on Climate Change, Tyndall-Manchester's work was, as noted by\u000d\u000a      the Secretary of State [A], to be pivotal in the UK basing it targets on a\u000d\u000a      cumulative approach. Ultimately this led to a shift from an advisory 60%\u000d\u000a      reduction target to an 80% target enshrined in primary legislation\u000d\u000a    Tyndall Manchester influenced this decision through:\u000d\u000a    i. A report commissioned by Welsh Assembly Government (Towards 2&#176;C:\u000d\u000a        emissions reduction scenarios for Wales) &#8212; Tyndall-Manchester\u000d\u000a      developed emission scenarios for Wales based on the cumulative budget\u000d\u000a      analysis undertaken by Anderson and Bows and provided formal written and\u000d\u000a      oral reports back to the Welsh Climate Change Commission and the Welsh\u000d\u000a      Cabinet.\u000d\u000a    ii.

Contributing to Prime Minister's Office report on carbon trading\u000d\u000a      (2009) [E]\u000d\u000a    3) Inclusion of shipping emissions in UK carbon budgets.\u000d\u000a    Transport contributes significantly to carbon emissions but was initially\u000d\u000a      excluded from targets in the UK Climate Change act. Input from\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester academics was influential in the UK Committee on\u000d\u000a      Climate Change's (CCC) advice to government to include international\u000d\u000a      shipping emissions in the UK carbon budgets [F]. This advice is not\u000d\u000a      legally-binding, but the 2008 Act does require Government to respond\u000d\u000a      directly to the advice of the CCC and typically Government develops policy\u000d\u000a      on the basis of the advice (as it is with aviation and shipping)\u000d\u000a    4) Emission pathways align more with a 4&#176;C than 2&#176;C level of warming.\u000d\u000a    Tyndall Manchester research is continuing to have significant impact on\u000d\u000a      the UK, EU and Global debates on the carbon budgets and emission pathways\u000d\u000a      commensurate with 2&#176;C.

TMA is a load-carrying mechanism mobilised at very\u000d\u000a        large deflections that enables the floor to develop a load carrying\u000d\u000a        capacity much higher than the capacity that is normally used in\u000d\u000a        structural design. Utilising TMA exploits the inherent reserve in\u000d\u000a        strength of the floor, enabling the floor to sustain the applied loads\u000d\u000a        in fire without the need for additional fire protection for up to 40% of\u000d\u000a        the steel floor beams.

In 2008,\u000a      residents used noise meters supplied by MfC and were involved in the\u000a      development of a\u000a      measurement protocol that was both scientifically sound and practical to\u000a      implement. Between\u000a      January and February 2008, they took more than 1,500 noise measurements\u000a      throughout the day\u000a      and night to develop their own `noise maps' [c]. As a result, the Environment\u000a        Agency appointed\u000a        an acoustic consultant to carry out a detailed analysis of noise in\u000a      and from the scrapyard,\u000a      which led to the scrapyard's licence being revoked [d]. Lewis Herlitz,\u000a      Director of the Pepys\u000a      Community Forum, said: \"The Noise Mapping work is a major breakthrough for\u000a      residents. It\u000a      allowed them to develop an evidence base about how noise damages their\u000a        quality of life. It\u000a      shows that their long-standing concerns are real and need to be acted on.\u000a      It provides an\u000a      opportunity for greater community engagement around monitoring and\u000a      speaking up for an\u000a      improved environment. There is no going back\" [e].\u000a    In 2011, residents wanted to assess the estate's air quality. Diffusion\u000a      tubes (commonly used to\u000a      measure nitrogen dioxide) were placed around the area, and wipe samples\u000a      taken to assess the\u000a      quantity and type of metals being deposited on vertical surfaces. Ozone\u000a      levels were measured and\u000a      leaf samples collected. As a result of the mapping survey, the local\u000a        authority (Lewisham) has\u000a        installed diffusion tubes at the main junctions identified by the\u000a        project as having higher levels\u000a      of NO2. They also installed a PM10 monitoring station in the\u000a      neighbourhood to monitor the local\u000a      situation [f]. Previously, the closest fixed monitoring station was just\u000a      over a kilometre away.\u000a    Local council policy changes, Barking 2008: Working\u000a      alongside the neighbourhood\u000a      management team in Marks Gate, Barking and Dagenham, Mapping for Change\u000a      led the\u000a      development of a local action plan from the results of 130 individual maps\u000a      of local perceptions in\u000a      2008 created by local residents. The neighbourhood management team used\u000a      the participatory\u000a      process to identify the issues of most concern to the residents and then\u000a      act on them in\u000a      collaboration with a range of local stakeholders, including the police and\u000a      local authority. These\u000a      included a community group organising for a previously dirty lake to\u000a        be cleaned four times a\u000a        year, with the council parks' service allocating a budget\u000a      for the clean up; the mapping team\u000a      acted as a link between community groups and council departments, with the\u000a      result that the library\u000a        is now open three extra days a week and its issue figures have\u000a      doubled; local street pastors\u000a        use the map to identify and target anti-social behaviour hotspots;\u000a      and information about\u000a      crimes reported to the mapping team that were not reported to police have\u000a      been passed on,\u000a      helping the police develop a more accurate picture of local crime and\u000a        antisocial behaviour\u000a      [g].\u000a    Royal Docks Noise Mapping (2009-2011): Concerned about\u000a      increasing levels of noise from\u000a      London's City Airport, residents in London's Royal Docks carried out noise\u000a        mapping for use in a\u000a        campaign against plans to expand the airport's operations. Working\u000a      in partnership with local\u000a      campaign group Fight the Flights, MfC provided noise meters and worked\u000a      with residents to develop\u000a      a protocol for noise measurement. This was used during normal flight\u000a      operations and, due to the\u000a      on-going relationship between MfC and the community, during the eruption\u000a      of the Icelandic volcano\u000a      that grounded all flights in April 2010. Noise levels rose to the\u000a      60-decibel range on only three\u000a      occasions during the no-flight period, whereas during normal flight\u000a      operations highs of 87 decibels\u000a      were recorded with just under a third of all readings exceeding 60\u000a      decibels. These efforts, and the\u000a      noise mapping activities, gained coverage in The Evening Standard,\u000a      bringing this important\u000a      issue to the attention of a broader public audience across the city [h].\u000a      One of the participants\u000a      reported feeling that \"the Royal Docks mapping project brought residents\u000a      together and gave them\u000a      confidence to call for changes in their community\" [i].\u000a    Heathrow Airport Noise Mapping (2011-ongoing): Mapping for\u000a      Change is working in partnership\u000a      with HACAN (Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise) and\u000a      the EU-funded\u000a      EveryAware project to map noise issues around the airport. Mobile\u000a        phone software developed\u000a        by MfC provides a low-cost, widely available noise monitoring tool.\u000a      More than 250 people in\u000a      the Heathrow area are contributing data to the noise map. Following MfC's\u000a      work with HACAN, in\u000a      2013 the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead initiated a\u000a        large-scale citizen-driven\u000a        noise-monitoring project using the WideNoise App [j]. Importantly,\u000a      the project also highlighted\u000a      the importance of the MfC approach to citizen science &#8212; where projects are\u000a      co-designed with the\u000a      participants. Indeed, due to this process participants showed a full\u000a      understanding of the limitations\u000a      of the tool, stating that: \"It will never stand up in court to the levels\u000a      taken by professional\u000a      microphones, but is great for the general awareness of the level\" [k].\u000a    Air quality mapping around London (2011-ongoing): In 2011,\u000a      MfC used diffusion tubes to\u000a      measure nitrogen dioxide levels at seven locations around London, with\u000a      participants recruited\u000a      through social media. The results showed that along main road networks NO2\u000a      levels were as much\u000a      as 75% above EU guidelines; it also highlighted issues in several\u000a      residential back roads used as\u000a      rat-runs. In Putney, concerns raised by the Putney Society about air\u000a      quality were successful in\u000a      leveraging political support to lobby for change, leading Transport\u000a        for London to introduce to\u000a        the area in 2012 new buses that comply with higher emission standards\u000a      [l] [m]. In Highbury,\u000a      Jenny Jones, the Green Party mayoral candidate, held a meeting with 40\u000a      residents to discuss air\u000a      quality. She said the mapping results were \"terrifying\" but that the\u000a      turnout had brought her hope\u000a      and she recognised that the issue was obviously important for local\u000a      communities [n]. MfC has\u000a      partnered with other London organisations to call for action on air\u000a        pollution [o] and has\u000a      hosted an Air Pollution conference attended by around 120 participants\u000a      from local government and\u000a      community groups in April 2013 [p], leading to the development of further\u000a      action on air pollution by\u000a      community groups and local authorities, such as community air quality\u000a      monitoring in the Barbican\u000a      in collaboration with the City of London which will start in the autumn of\u000a      2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The social enterprise Mapping for Change (MfC) was established to make\u000a      use of participatory\u000a      mapping knowledge and software created through research at UCL.

Since joining UCL's Department of Geomatic\u000a      Engineering in 2001,\u000a      Professor Muki Haklay (Professor of Geographical Information Science) has\u000a      researched the\u000a      methodologies and technologies of participatory GIS, including usability\u000a      engineering aspects (e.g.\u000a      [5]). From 2007 onwards, he extended his work to the area of citizen\u000a      science, in which lay\u000a      participants collect and analyse data using scientific methodologies and\u000a      tools [1,2]. Moreover, he\u000a      has since become recognised as an international research leader in these\u000a      areas.\u000a    During 2007-2008, Haklay (as PI) obtained funding from HEFCE through HEIF\u000a      3 for the `Mapping\u000a      Change for Sustainable Communities' (MCSC) project, supported by Dr Claire\u000a      Ellul (then a post-doctoral\u000a      researcher, now a lecturer at UCL). As part of the MCSC project, Ellul\u000a      developed the\u000a      software infrastructure for a unique web-based system allowing the rapid\u000a      creation and adaptation\u000a      of community maps [1, 4], with a focus on extensibility, reliability,\u000a      generality, anticipation of change\u000a      and growth. UCL's research included the development of a web-based\u000a      collaborative mapping\u000a      system, using usability engineering and human-computer interaction (HCI)\u000a      research to ensure that\u000a      the system is trusted and usable to people with limited literacy, and the\u000a      development of new\u000a      methods for community engagement through mapping [e.g. 3].\u000a    UCL's framework and software development was undertaken hand in hand with\u000a      research into the\u000a      practicalities of how to use a structured process to work with communities\u000a      in conducting both on-and\u000a      offline community mapping. The research included carrying out targeted\u000a      activities with different\u000a      groups in London. The projects were initially developed by Haklay through\u000a      his own research, often\u000a      in collaboration with community organisations such as Planning Aid for\u000a      London or London\u000a      Sustainability Exchange, and continued as a fundamental part of MCSC [2,\u000a      4]. The insights yielded\u000a      by this research resulted in the development by Haklay and researchers at\u000a      the charity London 21\u000a      Sustainability Network, from 2008 onward, of a series of toolkits for use\u000a      by community\u000a      organisations, non-governmental organisations and interested individuals,\u000a      including two for general\u000a      community mapping and one for noise mapping.\u000a    Further research conducted by Haklay, Ellul and their research team since\u000a      2007 has looked at\u000a      appropriate methods for participant recruitment in different contexts (for\u000a      example, in EU FP7\u000a      EveryAware project), and the extent to which community groups and\u000a      individuals within those\u000a      groups, once recruited, will contribute to mapping and citizen science\u000a      projects and maintain their\u000a      contribution over time. The research provides insight into the success of\u000a      online recruitment\u000a      techniques when compared to offline ones [2]. The outcomes of combining\u000a      high- and low-tech\u000a      approaches have also been investigated; current projects combine paper\u000a      mapping and paper\u000a      forms, sketches and post-it notes with noise meters, diffusion tubes and\u000a      wipes for air pollution,\u000a      mobile noise apps and online mapping. The mix of technologies and\u000a      approaches extends concepts\u000a      of participatory GIS developed by Haklay from a level where users are just\u000a      given data to a level\u000a      where they are involved in the overall system and experiment design,\u000a      protocol development and\u000a      results analysis &#8212; that is, towards fully collaborative science.\u000a    The underlying computer code for the mapping application and the\u000a      knowledge of how to integrate\u000a      the application's use during participatory processes are based on the\u000a      research described above.\u000a      They integrate lessons in the area of geospatial web (geoweb)\u000a      technologies, usability and human-computer\u000a      interaction of GIS studies, community engagement and public access to\u000a      environmental\u000a      information. Since 2009, the software and processes have benefited from\u000a      dual development\u000a      through requirements and lessons within UCL research projects such as\u000a      EPSRC Adaptable\u000a      Suburbs, and through needs emerging from MfC activities.

These have included conferences and\u000a      seminars for professionals involved in children's travel and play,\u000a      including the Play Research Network (1 Feb 2008), Play Scotland (19 Nov\u000a      2008), the Health and Consumers Directorate General of the EU (11 Feb\u000a      2011), the West Midlands Region School Travel Advisors (3 March 2011), and\u000a      at invited seminars in Romania (10 November 2008) the USA (20 Feb 2009)\u000a      and New Zealand (5 Nov 2012).\u000a    Informing policy advocacy: The Sustainable Development\u000a      Commission, formerly the UK government's independent adviser on\u000a      sustainable development, cited Mackett's research on calories burned by\u000a      children undertaking various activities and using various modes of travel\u000a      in its 2011 report `Fairness in a Car-dependent Society', quoting various\u000a      results as part of the discussion about obesity [a, pages 29, 67].\u000a      Advocacy groups such as Sustrans and Living Streets, and local groups,\u000a      frequently cite Mackett's research as evidence for action to be undertaken\u000a      to increase children's physical activity. For example, Sustrans quoted\u000a      Mackett in an October 2011 submission on road safety to the parliamentary\u000a      Transport Select Committee [b], while Living Streets cited his work in an\u000a      expert paper included in NICE public health guidance on promoting walking\u000a      and cycling, issued in November 2012 [c]. `State of Play', published by\u000a      the Association of Play Industries for use by advocates of children's play\u000a      and the play equipment industry, quotes Mackett in outlining the benefits\u000a      of play for children's health and in claiming that children tend to walk\u000a      when they go out to play. They use this evidence to argue for safer\u000a        streets and places for play [d, page 11]. Play England, a charity\u000a      supported by government departments and industry, which seeks to promote\u000a      the vision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, used Mackett's\u000a      research to argue for the health benefits of children's play, and\u000a      Play Wales used the research to provide evidence for public health\u000a        specialists, primary care teams and healthy school co-ordinators about\u000a        the benefits of children's play [e, pages 4-5; f, page 2].\u000a    Influence on policy documents and guidelines: In 2008, the\u000a      National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) produced\u000a      `Guidance on physical activity, play and sport for pre-school and school\u000a      age children' for health and transport policy makers and practitioners,\u000a      which includes a cost-effectiveness analysis of four interventions to\u000a      increase child and adolescent physical activity. One of the interventions\u000a      considered was walking buses to school: evidence from Mackett's\u000a        research was used by the NICE team to demonstrate that this was the most\u000a        cost-effective intervention [g, pages 5-12, 27-29]. Additionally,\u000a      the research on the benefits of play has been widely taken up by\u000a        central and local government. It was cited in the document `Fair\u000a      Play: A Consultation on the Play Strategy, A Commitment from the\u000a      Children's Plan' issued by the Department for Children, Schools and\u000a      Families and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport [h], which says:\u000a      \"Active play is also one of the best ways for children to burn calories\u000a      outside of PE lessons.\" [h, page 10]. This consultation was used to\u000a        develop the National Play Strategy, published in December 2008 and\u000a      which set out the government's 10-year vision to deliver more and better\u000a      play opportunities for children in England.\u000a    Implementation by local authorities: Conwy Active for Life,\u000a      published by Conwy County Borough Council (2011) \"to strategically\u000a      prioritise effective delivery mechanisms to ensure that Conwy is a county\u000a      where physical activity is at the heart of the community\", cites Mackett's\u000a      research about the benefits of various types of play for children [i, page\u000a      12]. Figures from the Reducing Children's Car Use study published in 2004\u000a      are used to calculate of the number of calories consumed walking and\u000a        cycling to school in the School Travel Health Check (STHC) tool\u000a      which is used by local authorities and schools to set priorities,\u000a        outcomes and milestones to improve active and sustainable travel to\u000a      school [j]. In 2011, the STHC was used by 29 local authorities, 4,626\u000a      schools, and over 1.5 million pupils, for example in Plymouth, Bristol and\u000a      Cornwall [k]. The STHC was also used in the 2012 South East Dorset\u000a      Multi-Modal Transport Study [k], which led to the adoption of School\u000a      Travel Plans in Bournemouth to encourage more walking and cycling to\u000a      school and has been used by Dorset County Council to set targets for\u000a      walking and cycling. This strategy to increase working and cycling by\u000a      children will require a budget of &#163;2.042m over 15 years [k].\u000a    Informing media coverage: This has helped to further inform\u000a        public understanding of the importance of children's activity. Since\u000a      2008, this has included an article on the effects of parental choice of\u000a      school on children's physical activity levels, in the Daily Telegraph; the\u000a      risk of children whose parents drive them a lot becoming car-dependent\u000a      adults, in the New York Times; and a BBC Breakfast television feature on\u000a      children's independent movement on urban areas. [l]\u000a    Improving children's health through the institution of walking\u000a          buses to school: Since the publication of the 2008 NICE\u000a      guidance on physical activity, play and sport for children (which drew on\u000a      Mackett's research, as noted above), walking buses have been set up\u000a        around the country. 130 now exist in Staffordshire, for example; a\u000a      further 60 have been set up in Kent and 30 in West Sussex [m]. The\u000a      benefits of these buses extend, moreover, beyond positive impacts on\u000a      children's health and well-being to environmental benefits arising\u000a        from reductions in the number of car journeys made to school: in\u000a      Thurrock, Essex, for instance, estimates show walking buses have saved\u000a        an average of 2160g of CO2 per mile [n].\u000a    Preventing school closures: Campaigners used the research\u000a      on children's travel to school to help make the case to keep Bearsden\u000a      Primary School at Bearsden Cross, in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, rather\u000a      then move to Castlehill where, it was claimed, more children would need to\u000a      travel by car [o]. Campaigners said that closure would damage educational\u000a      outcomes, represent poor value for the council taxpayer and harm the\u000a      commercial and community heart of Bearsden. The school was subsequently\u000a      saved [o].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research led by Professor Roger Mackett of the Department of Civil,\u000a      Environmental and Geomatic Engineering at UCL on children's physical\u000a      activity has been used by central and local government, other public\u000a      bodies and various advocacy groups to encourage children to be more\u000a      active.

The projects,\u000a      on which Mackett was Principal Investigator, also involved researchers\u000a      from the Universities of Exeter and Oxford, Hertfordshire County Council,\u000a      and Herts Health Promotion as Co-investigators. All the research was\u000a      carried out at UCL under Mackett's supervision.\u000a    The first of these projects, `Reducing Children's Car Use', ran between\u000a      2001 and 2003. It addressed the issue identified in Mackett's earlier work\u000a      for the Department for Transport (1998-2000) that many short car trips in\u000a      Britain result from meeting the needs of children. Making large numbers of\u000a      trips by car has possible serious implications for children's health\u000a      because of the lack of physical activity, and may contribute to car\u000a      dependency in later life. The UCL-based research took the innovative step\u000a      of fitting accelerometers to 200 children for four days and requiring them\u000a      to complete travel and activity diaries. Mackett's group devised a\u000a      taxonomy scheme for the children's activities, allowing the number of\u000a      calories consumed per minute on each activity to be calculated. The\u000a      research showed that not only did children use more calories when walking\u000a      than they did in the car, but that the older children aged 12-13 used more\u000a      calories walking to and from school in a week than they did in two hours\u000a      of PE and games lessons (the recommended standard levels of physical\u000a      activity for children) [6]. It was also shown that children use more\u000a      calories in free play than in equivalent organised activities, and that\u000a      they tend to walk when they go out to play, but are taken by car to\u000a      organised activities. This research provided useful evidence to explain\u000a      the increase in obesity amongst children. A specific intervention that was\u000a      examined as part of this project was walking buses, in which groups of\u000a      children walk to school under adult supervision. The research found that\u000a      nearly half the trips made on walking buses were previously made by car,\u000a      and that children transferring from a car to using a walking bus were\u000a      involved in an extra 22 minutes of physical activity per day [7].\u000a    The second project, titled `Children's activities, perceptions and\u000a      behaviour in the local environment' (CAPABLE), ran between 2004 and 2006,\u000a      and sought to monitor and explore children's interactions with the local\u000a      environment. In order to achieve this, the research team added GPS\u000a      monitors, as well as various qualitative indicators such as children's\u000a      drawings and interviews with parents, to the tools used previously\u000a      (diaries and accelerometers) to understand both the quantity and the\u000a      quality of children's activity by identifying differences in their\u000a      behaviour in different environments and under different circumstances.\u000a      Boys, for example, were found to move about more than girls [1,5]. It was\u000a      also shown that children moved in much straighter lines when they were\u000a      accompanied by an adult than they did when they were with other children,\u000a      suggesting that greater adult supervision of children outside the home may\u000a      be reducing children's exploratory behaviour and interaction with local\u000a      environments [5].\u000a    The data sets collected on the two projects were combined and analysed in\u000a      2012 to show the hypothetical benefits to children of a switch to\u000a      year-round British Summer Time. These benefits accrue particularly from\u000a      the findings of the research that children tend to be more active when\u000a      evenings are light [4], and that children who walk to school are more\u000a      active at other times [3]. Mackett has been able to incorporate a strong\u000a      international-comparative perspective on the earlier research through his\u000a      contribution between 2007 and 2009 to a project funded by the Norwegian\u000a      Research Council comparing children's car use and physical activity in\u000a      Britain, Denmark, Finland and Norway [2]. Mackett provided the data for\u000a      Britain and participated in the discussions leading to the conclusions\u000a      that children in Britain use active travel less than in the other\u000a      countries. In 2009 Mackett joined a project led by the Policy Studies\u000a      Institute to examine how children's independent mobility has changed over\u000a      the past 40 years and how it varies around the world. The results are\u000a      currently being published. They show that children's independent mobility\u000a      has continued to decrease in England over the period 1990-2010, but at a\u000a      slower rate than in the period 1971-1990 and that children have less\u000a      freedom to go out without adult supervision than in most other countries.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30002","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The long-standing relationship between UCL and NASA Jet Propulsion\u000a      Laboratory and NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre founded on the research\u000a      outlined above has been sustained to the present day via invited\u000a      presentations at those institutions; publications in scientific journals\u000a      (including joint publications with NASA scientists, e.g. [6]) and in\u000a      conference presentations. Ziebart has convened conference sessions on\u000a      orbit dynamics at the American Geophysical Union and the European\u000a      Geosciences Union, stimulating further work in the field. As well as\u000a      supporting this important relationship with NASA's research centres, the\u000a      work led to the UCL's participation (2003 onwards) in the NASA Ocean\u000a      Surface Topography Science working team. Ziebart became a board member of\u000a      the International GNSS Service (IGS) in 2011, and provided leadership of\u000a      the IGS working group on satellite orbit dynamics. These relationships\u000a      have provided vital pathways for the impacts of the research described\u000a      above. They have led, in particular, to the use of UCL research to correct\u000a      errors in the orbit prediction and orbit determination of satellites,\u000a      enabling these satellites to provide more precise data for a range of\u000a      applications, including monitoring the effects of climate change, and in\u000a      GPS satellite navigation systems.\u000a    Contributions to the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\u000a        Change (IPCC):\u000a      Because thermal expansion and ice cover loss (glaciers, ice sheets)\u000a      contribute to rising sea level, ocean monitoring provides one of the best\u000a      ways of modelling long-term climate effects. Sea level monitoring is\u000a      carried out using high-accuracy altimetry satellites that are able to\u000a      record millimetre-level changes, enabling precise calculations of\u000a      temperature changes in the ocean over time. NASA's primary mission for\u000a      measuring sea level change was the Jason-1 satellite, which was\u000a      operational from 2001 to 2013. Every ten days, Jason-1 produced a model of\u000a      the shape of the world's oceans, providing accurate indications of\u000a      long-term changes in sea level. Jason-1 data constituted a critical\u000a      element in the geophysical data records (GDRs, compiled by NASA, and used\u000a      widely by oceanographers to monitor and model ocean dynamics) determining\u000a      changes in the ocean's surface, thus forming one of the most powerful\u000a      pieces of evidence to show that the Earth's climate is changing.\u000a      Throughout Jason-1's lifetime, the GDRs were submitted to the\u000a      Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's principal\u000a      climate science assessment body whose members include representatives of\u000a      195 governments. The solar radiation pressure and thermal re-radiation\u000a      modelling techniques established by Ziebart's team, which were adopted as\u000a      operational standards by NASA in 2010 removed significant systematic\u000a      biases in the satellite orbits, reducing aliasing and anomalies in the sea\u000a      level records passed to the IPCC [6].\u000a    In December 2007, the IPCC released its Fourth Assessment Report on the\u000a      scientific basis, impacts and mitigation of climate change. It included\u000a      details of the recorded change in sea level to that point, based on\u000a      Jason-1 outputs. Between 2008 and 2013, data from Jason-1 continued to be\u000a      passed to the IPCC, feeding into its 2008 Climate Change and Water\u000a      Technical Report [f] and informing the subject matter of its Working Group\u000a      1, which monitors and reports on the physical science bases of climate\u000a      change. Reports from this working group are discussed by policymakers and\u000a      other stakeholders at the UN's annual climate change conferences (UN COP,\u000a      four of which have been held between 2008 and July 2013). The first draft\u000a      of the group's contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report,\u000a      including a summary for policymakers, was made available to governments\u000a      for comments in July 2013. A lead author for IPCC Working Group 1 says:\u000a      \"This mission [Jason-1] provides one of the fundamental inputs to the\u000a      IPCC... the computation of orbits is an integral step in the chain of\u000a      producing meaningful data. This data is being used by sea level scientists\u000a      to improve projections of future sea level rise.\"\u000a    In turn, the IPCC's data \"then affects directly the formulation of policy\u000a      seeking to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change upon the entire\u000a      population of the Earth.\" One direct application he points to is the use\u000a      of the data to determine planning for coastal infrastructure. [d]\u000a    GPS satellites: The development of Ziebart's techniques and their\u000a      subsequent testing (in particular the demonstration of the effectiveness\u000a      of earth radiation pressure and antenna thrust modelling) changed the way\u000a      in which the orbits of all GPS satellites are calculated &#8212; specifically\u000a      considering the directions and characteristics of forces previously not\u000a      considered. Those satellites have applications in monitoring the\u000a      earthquake cycle, measuring plate tectonics, precision agriculture as well\u000a      as for routine navigation applications in electronic devices such as\u000a      smartphones, which are used by many millions of people worldwide. The main\u000a      impact has been at the scientific end of the spectrum leading to an\u000a      accuracy improvement by a factor of 2.5 in the computed satellite orbits\u000a      [b].\u000a    These techniques were adopted as standard in 2010 by the International\u000a      GNSS Service, a voluntary federation of more than 200 worldwide agencies\u000a      that generates precise open-data GPS and GNSS products. The IGS produces\u000a      daily orbit calculations for all satellites; its adoption of the\u000a      techniques developed through UCL's work allowed it to improve its orbit\u000a      accuracy from 5cm to 2cm. IGS data usage is characterised by 700,000 site\u000a      visits a year, with circa 90 million downloads [e]. This data is used to\u000a      determine the terrestrial reference frame (TRF), the system of coordinates\u000a      used for monitoring the shape of the earth. The TRF forms the fundamental\u000a      basis for monitoring plate tectonics and height variation at tide gauges,\u000a      among other applications such as modelling sea level change and\u000a      post-glacial rebound, as well as commercial positioning services.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Departmental research led to changes in how radiation forces on several\u000a      classes of space vehicle (low earth orbit environmental measurement\u000a      satellites and medium earth orbit navigation missions like GPS) are\u000a      modelled by two NASA laboratories (Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard\u000a      Space Flight Centre).

Modelling\u000a      the forcing effects of radiation (solar, terrestrial and radiation from\u000a      the satellites) is important for accurate predictions of GPS (and other)\u000a      satellite orbital trajectories. GPS positioning accuracy depends directly\u000a      upon our ability to determine, and predict, satellite orbits. Millions of\u000a      real-time users rely upon navigation devices decoding messages that\u000a      include mathematical models of instantaneous satellite locations &#8212; this\u000a      relies fundamentally upon accurate satellite force models. Put another\u000a      way, mis-modelling satellite motion introduces errors into user position\u000a      estimates.\u000a    Novel research on modelling space vehicle surface forces was undertaken\u000a      between 2001 and 2007 by Marek Ziebart (Professor of Space Geodesy, at UCL\u000a      since 2000) and his team (primarily Ant Sibthorpe, now at NASA JPL, at UCL\u000a      2002-2008, and Sima Adhya, now running a space mission insurance group in\u000a      the City of London, at UCL 2002-2005). Ziebart developed these ideas [1]\u000a      in his PhD and through further EPSRC and NERC-funded projects whilst at\u000a      UCL. The major developments &#8212; specifically design and implementation of\u000a      novel tool sets, and extension of the basic concepts &#8212; all took place at\u000a      UCL (2001-2007). The project demonstrated that high-accuracy radiation\u000a      flux models, detailed computer simulations of space vehicle geometry and\u000a      attitude, and surface material properties (both optical and thermal) could\u000a      be used in a novel and original fashion to model radiation surface forces\u000a      on satellites for engineering, scientific and commercial applications [3].\u000a      The approach broke new ground and was well received by the engineering and\u000a      scientific community because although the effects were known to be\u000a      important, existing approaches were considered overly simplistic and\u000a      error-prone.\u000a    The techniques developed (efficient spacecraft surface modelling, custom\u000a      ray-tracing methods, treatment of thermal response of both satellite\u000a      multi-layered insulation and solar panels, earth radiation force modelling\u000a      and antenna thrust modelling [3,4,5]) led to research collaboration (from\u000a      2003) with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight\u000a      Centre and the US Air Force Research Laboratory. The UCL team proved their\u000a      approach's effectiveness to determine satellite positions in 2004 [2,3].\u000a      Improvements were shown in quality metrics both in orbit prediction (for\u000a      GPS satellites) and in sea surface height models (for altimetry\u000a      satellites). UCL space vehicle surface force models for satellite\u000a      altimetry platforms were subsequently adopted by NASA in 2010 for\u000a      operational production of orbits for scientific data processing.\u000a    Specific innovations developed during the 2001-2007 programme of research\u000a      include: using geometric primitives to reduce computational runtime; using\u000a      pixel arrays and enhanced ray-tracing methods to model radiation\u000a      interactions with satellite surfaces; modelling thermal forces on multi-\u000a      layered insulation; developing models of thermal gradients across solar\u000a      panels; modelling short and long-wavelength earth radiation fluxes; and\u000a      modelling antenna output thrust. These models were rigorously tested by\u000a      research groups external to UCL and were found to be superior to all other\u000a      approaches [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31109","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Use in national guidance documents: The 2010 publication `Manual\u000a      for Streets 2, wider application of the principles' [c], which carried\u000a      ministerial endorsement, looked at the application of Link and Place\u000a      principles to busier urban streets, and made reference to Link and Place\u000a      applications. (This publication built on the influential national guidance\u000a      document on street design: `Manual for Streets' [Department for Transport\u000a      and Communities and Local Government, 2007] which incorporated the basic\u000a      principles of Link and Place.)

It is also used to inform the guidance\u000a        the council gives to developers as to what they are expected to provide\u000a        in the public realm, and to what standard, as part of their proposals.\u000a        [j]\u000a    \u000a    Major UK applications: The first of these, in the London Borough\u000a      of Hounslow, was as part of an &#163;650m private finance initiative (PFI) to\u000a      upgrade and maintain the borough's highway network over a 25-year period,\u000a      starting in early 2013. The local authority needed a transparent method to\u000a      define standards for highway reconstruction and maintenance, which would\u000a      be objective and responsive to changing circumstances. The criteria for\u000a      allocating a particular Link and Place status to each street segment is\u000a      set out in the PFI contract, so that if circumstances change over the\u000a      25-year period, then the status of the relevant street segments will be\u000a      reassessed, and the maintenance standards adjusted, if necessary. There\u000a      was a national competition among local authorities to obtain PFI funding,\u000a      and this novel application of Link and Place was reported by the Council\u000a      as being one reason why Hounslow was successful in its bid for DfT and\u000a      Treasury funding [l]. The council confirmed that its first targets had\u000a      been met: as of 30 June 2013, 432km of streets and footways had been\u000a      rehabilitated (15.4% of the total); 7.5% of street lighting replaced with\u000a      LED and centralised control; and 8 bridges restored to meet load-carrying\u000a      requirements [l].\u000a    The second application is in relation to a new strategic assessment of\u000a      the future role of the London road network, initiated by the Mayor of\u000a      London in autumn 2012. Jones worked on an independent Roads Task Force,\u000a      comprising stakeholders representing different transport mode and business\u000a      interests, plus NGOs and local authorities, to use a modified version of\u000a      the Link and Place approach (in the form of a family of `street types'\u000a      based around `Moving and Place' street functions), recognising that there\u000a      is a diverse range of streets which perform different functions, and that\u000a      priorities and appropriate design solutions will therefore vary across the\u000a      network. TfL has said this allowed for a much more sophisticated approach\u000a      to analysing and planning investment than the traditional road user\u000a      hierarchy [k]. The RTF report was published in July 2013, with the `Moving\u000a      and Place' classification of streets being a core element [f]. It was\u000a      warmly welcomed by a broad range of stakeholders, including the London\u000a      boroughs [k]. TfL now requires that boroughs use this street\u000a      classification when submitting funding bids for new schemes to TfL, though\u000a      the LIP (Local Implementation Plan) process. The director of London\u000a      Councils, which represents London's boroughs, confirms that the approach\u000a      is already being used, with a &#163;3m scheme to upgrade the street environment\u000a      in Hornchurch completed in June 2013. In Bexleyheath, the balance between\u000a      competing needs has been recognised in the planning process. [k]\u000a    Public engagement in street planning: Jones recognised the\u000a      potential of the broader formulation of streets as providing a basis for\u000a      carrying out more effective and consensual public engagement activities,\u000a      since it explicitly recognises the legitimate interests of all street\u000a      users groups, not simply motor vehicle drivers. In 2007-08, the street\u000a      design toolkit he developed in the DISTILLATE project was applied in two\u000a      exercises in the West Midlands (Bloxwich and Coventry), where the public\u000a      had strongly objected to design proposals put forward by the local\u000a      councils, which were then withdrawn. In both cases, new designs were\u000a      generated by local stakeholders that were subsequently implemented with\u000a      high levels of public and business support, and minimal objection [see\u000a      outputs 8 and 4, pp. 250-252]. In 2008 Walsall Council commissioned UCL to\u000a      provide two sets of the toolkit for their own use, in subsequent complex\u000a      street design contexts.\u000a    Provision of training to urban planners: Jones has been invited to\u000a      run various training events to explain the principles of Link and Place\u000a      and its derivations to urban planners. In 2013 this has included sessions\u000a      for Urban Design London (with 80+ London borough representatives, TfL\u000a      staff and consultants in attendance), and as part of a training programme\u000a      for engineers and planners from the UAE, organised by PTRC &#8212; the training\u000a      arm of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Peter Jones' research developed new principles for urban street planning\u000a      and design, which have been incorporated into Department for Transport\u000a      (DfT) and Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) national\u000a      guidelines.

This found that urban street design has been dominated by meeting\u000a      the needs of motorised vehicles, with consequential poor physical street\u000a      environments that negatively impacted on local economic, social and\u000a      cultural activity, and has resulted in unattractive public spaces. The\u000a      underlying problem was identified as being due to the classification of\u000a      streets purely in terms of their traffic movement functions, thereby\u000a      ignoring other street user needs. To address this problem, he developed a\u000a      comprehensive basis for identifying and classifying the various functions\u000a      of different types of urban streets, recognising that urban streets\u000a      accommodate a wide range of movement and non-movement activities. The\u000a      research replaces the one-dimensional vehicle-based street classification\u000a      with a two-dimensional classification, based on their `Link' (movement by\u000a      all modes of transport) and `Place' (living) functions, and develops a\u000a      comprehensive set of operational, planning, design and appraisal\u000a      procedures that build on these principles. Link requirements are defined\u000a      in terms of the movement needs of all street users (including\u000a      pedestrians), while Place requirements describe the various economic,\u000a      social and cultural activities that are to be planned for on and adjacent\u000a      to the street.\u000a    Some of the initial conceptual thinking emerged from the EU-funded\u000a      ARTISTS project (2002 to 2005), involving academics, consultants and city\u000a      authorities from several European countries, which looked at how urban\u000a      streets could contribute to more sustainable urban communities. After he\u000a      moved to UCL in 2005, Jones, together with Dr Stephen Marshall (Reader in\u000a      Urban Morphology and Planning, at UCL since 2000) developed this abstract\u000a      thinking into a practical street classification system that was trialled\u000a      on the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). A set of planning and\u000a      design procedures was developed through research and case study\u000a      applications in London largely funded by Transport for London. In 2007,\u000a      Jones and Marshall published the detailed guide Link and Place: A\u000a        guide to street planning and design [1], which was endorsed by\u000a      Transport for London and the Chartered Institution of Highways and\u000a      Transportation. Natalya Boujenko, a co-author in this publication, worked\u000a      for Transport for London, and led the field trials.\u000a    The Link and Place procedures developed through this research [2,3,5-7]\u000a      include:\u000a    \u000a       Defining requirements for highway construction and maintenance in\u000a        urban areas, with the Link status determining the carriageway provision,\u000a        and the Place status the provision and maintenance of the footway and\u000a        street furniture, plus the street-cleansing regime.\u000a       Measuring street performance in a comprehensive way that takes full\u000a        account of the range of street functions.\u000a       Determining the acceptability of the current performance of a street\u000a        segment, by benchmarking this against appropriate regulatory\u000a        requirements or comparative levels of performance &#8212; recognising that\u000a        `acceptable performance' may vary with Link and Place status levels.\u000a       Prioritising segments of the street network for improvement, based on\u000a        shortfalls in current performance and status levels.\u000a       Comprehensively assessing street design requirements, through\u000a        detailed consideration of street activities and their space\/capacity\u000a        requirements, at desirable and minimum levels of provision.\u000a       Identifying design objectives and constraints, and formulating these\u000a        in the preparation of a comprehensive Design Brief.\u000a       Developing a set of design options that meet the requirements set out\u000a        in the Design Brief, with stakeholder involvement; and\u000a       Appraising design options, in terms of their contribution to\u000a        addressing the measured shortfalls in street performance, in a\u000a        cost-effective manner.\u000a    \u000a    For design purposes, the approach defines more precisely sets of user\u000a      needs and identifies ways in which they might be met through providing\u000a      different `street design elements'; it moves away from the notion of a\u000a      fixed `road user hierarchy', recognising that priorities vary according to\u000a      the type of street, and it provided guidelines on how to prioritise among\u000a      competing user needs in different situations. It has proved particularly\u000a      successful in engaging stakeholders in street design where space use is\u000a      contested, bringing together the resident and business communities,\u000a      alongside local politicians, transport planners, traffic engineers, land\u000a      use planners and urban designers.\u000a    Between 2005 and 2008, Jones participated in the EPSRC-funded DISTILLATE\u000a      project (co-ordinated through Leeds University), which developed a range\u000a      of new decision support tools for local transport planning. As part of\u000a      this, he developed a street design toolkit to help in generating\u000a      acceptable streetscape design solutions in contentious situations [4, 8].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33609","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Parker Hannifin\u000d\u000a    The metamodel-based optimisation methods developed in the UoA and\u000d\u000a      described in Section 2 have been combined with high fidelity Computational\u000d\u000a      Fluid Dynamics analysis (Thompson, School of Mechanical Engineering,\u000d\u000a      University of Leeds) to develop new product design optimisation software\u000d\u000a      [A, B, C]. A transformation of the design variable space was proposed that\u000d\u000a      has dramatically improved the fidelity of the metamodel without an\u000d\u000a      excessive number of CFD simulations thus providing a practical tool for\u000d\u000a      the pump designers [A].\u000d\u000a    Based on research in the UoA the company developed software which they\u000d\u000a      then used to increase the efficiency of their jet pumps by 20% [A].

This new component of diesel\u000d\u000a      filtration systems was awarded the prestigious Grand Prix prize at the\u000d\u000a      2012 British Engineering Excellence Awards: \"An inventive engineering\u000d\u000a      solution that solves a significant environmental problem and which has\u000d\u000a      strong commercial drivers to a large potential market\" [D].\u000d\u000a    This innovation based on research described in Section 2 has enabled the\u000d\u000a      company to secure a number of orders from major clients, thereby creating\u000d\u000a      80 new jobs [A]. The company has further used this new product to gain new\u000d\u000a      business from a key manufacturer in the agriculture and construction\u000d\u000a      machines sector. This contract, worth &#163;1.5 million per year (2012-2017),\u000d\u000a      has led the company to appoint nine new employees to deliver the new\u000d\u000a      business [A].

YAS has over 110 locations, 4500 staff and 1500\u000d\u000a      vehicles. Having participated in the Carbon Trust's Public Sector Carbon\u000d\u000a      Management programme in 2010, YAS drew up a Carbon Management Plan for\u000d\u000a      2011-2015. Taking 2007 as the baseline year when the carbon footprint was\u000d\u000a      16,531 tonnes of CO2, YAS decided to set a target of a 30%\u000d\u000a      reduction in carbon usage by 2015 with the added benefit of a cost saving\u000d\u000a      of &#163;3.39 million.\u000d\u000a    Researchers in the UoA secured an EPSRC Knowledge Transfer Secondment\u000d\u000a      (EP\/H500251\/1) which allowed them to work with YAS in applying the\u000d\u000a      optimisation research described above to ambulance design in conjunction\u000d\u000a      with Computational Fluid Dynamics from the School of Mechanical\u000d\u000a      Engineering at Leeds (Thompson). Initial investigation led to a focus on\u000d\u000a      the light bars on the vehicle roof and this demonstrated that the drag\u000d\u000a      force could be reduced by up to 20% [E].\u000d\u000a    This optimised design was applicable to up to 60% of the YAS fleet which\u000d\u000a      was shown to equate to an annual &#163;700,000 saving in fuel costs and an\u000d\u000a      annual reduction of 500 tCO2 [E].\u000d\u000a    Based on the results of the KTS YAS commissioned new ambulance designs\u000d\u000a      that came into operation in early July 2013 [E]. The new vehicles have\u000d\u000a      achieved 26 mpg compared to 16-18 mpg previously [E]. Given the figure of\u000d\u000a      40 million kilometres per year across the YAS fleet this equates to\u000d\u000a      significant potential savings. YAS state \"in the first year of utilising\u000d\u000a      the new vehicles in part of the fleet YAS expect to save &#163;300,000 in fuel\"\u000d\u000a      along with the consequent CO2 reductions [E].\u000d\u000a    Rolls-Royce\u000d\u000a    The research on optimisation outlined above has been implemented in the\u000d\u000a      Rolls-Royce SOFT optimisation system leading to its successful use during\u000d\u000a      the REF period \"in live aeroengine design projects with tens of hours of\u000d\u000a      CPU time per simulation and over a hundred design variables\" [F]. In this\u000d\u000a      way the research in the UoA has led to optimisation of designs that was\u000d\u000a      previously impossible due to prohibitive computational requirements [F].\u000d\u000a    Rolls-Royce states that the systems based on the UoA research \"has been\u000d\u000a      successfully used for real-life optimisation of RR compressor blades (e.g.\u000d\u000a      the ESS (Engine Sector Stator blade) component of a high-bypass ratio\u000d\u000a      engine) and on the Trent turbine HP and IP stages that are being developed\u000d\u000a      in RR\".

Whilst the Rolls-Royce system has a\u000d\u000a      range of optimisation techniques, Rolls-Royce states that \"so far, MAM has\u000d\u000a      proved to be the most efficient and accurate of the optimisers where\u000d\u000a      expensive high fidelity CFD codes are used in the optimisation process\"\u000d\u000a      [F] and that \"overall MAM has been an order of magnitude faster than other\u000d\u000a      previously used techniques, this has reduced the optimisation time\u000d\u000a      significantly, and made MAM a practical design tool on a modest Linux\u000d\u000a      cluster\" [F].\u000d\u000a    It is hard to put a financial figure to these benefits and Rolls-Royce do\u000d\u000a      not calculate such figures due to the uncertainties of operating\u000d\u000a      conditions and other variables. However, given that a commercial airline\u000d\u000a      spends billions of dollars per year on fuel [G], even a small efficiency\u000d\u000a      improvement leads to millions of dollars of cost savings.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Optimisation tools developed in the UoA have significantly advanced the\u000d\u000a      ability to find the best designs for complex systems in cases where these\u000d\u000a      were previously unobtainable.

This has focused on metamodelling and improved sampling.\u000d\u000a    Metamodelling-based optimisation and stochastic analysis are used\u000d\u000a      in situations where even a single numerical simulation of a system or a\u000d\u000a      complex process is not possible due to any of: excessive computing time;\u000d\u000a      response polluted by numerical noise; instabilities in the calculations.\u000d\u000a      These problems are exacerbated by the fact that an optimisation run or a\u000d\u000a      Monte Carlo simulation requires many simulations rather than just one. In\u000d\u000a      view of this the only realistic way of addressing such problems is to\u000d\u000a      build high quality \"emulators\" or \"metamodels\" to mimic the full model.\u000d\u000a      These (i) describe the behaviour of the system (or a process) with\u000d\u000a      sufficient accuracy as compared to a full simulation, (ii) are\u000d\u000a      computationally inexpensive and (iii) do not possess any significant\u000d\u000a      amount of numerical noise. When such metamodels are obtained and,\u000d\u000a      importantly, their quality is verified, they can be used in optimisation\u000d\u000a      or a Monte Carlo simulation in place of the original, significantly more\u000d\u000a      expensive simulations.\u000d\u000a    In order to build a metamodel it is necessary to perform sampling\u000d\u000a      by running a sufficient number of numerical simulations in the space of\u000d\u000a      optimisation variables and\/or stochastic factors according to a carefully\u000d\u000a      chosen design of experiments (DOE). Experiments normally refer to\u000d\u000a      numerical simulation at various combinations of optimisation or stochastic\u000d\u000a      variables, but research in the UoA demonstrated that this may also include\u000d\u000a      laboratory experiments [1]. Uniform designs of experiments that are based\u000d\u000a      on the concept of an optimal Latin hypercube have been developed in the\u000d\u000a      UoA with the intention of gathering as much information on the behaviour\u000d\u000a      of the system (or a process) as possible with a minimum number of sampling\u000d\u000a      points thereby ensuring fidelity but with minimum computer time. These\u000d\u000a      innovative methods include nested DOEs, i.e. individual uniform DOEs that\u000d\u000a      are used separately for metamodel building and validation and can then be\u000d\u000a      merged while remaining uniform [2].

This has been a basis for a multidisciplinary optimisation\u000d\u000a        framework [3].\u000d\u000a      Metamodelling, based on the interaction of low- and high-fidelity\u000d\u000a        simulation models, that is beneficial for creating high quality\u000d\u000a        metamodels when a lower complexity simulation model is available in\u000d\u000a        addition to the original high fidelity simulation model. In such case\u000d\u000a        the metamodel can be based on the low fidelity model which is corrected\u000d\u000a        and tuned using only a small number of runs of the high fidelity model\u000d\u000a        [4].

In order to deal with the \"curse of dimensionality\",\u000d\u000a      approximations in MAM are based on the class of intrinsically linear\u000d\u000a      functions and also include simple rational functions and moving least\u000d\u000a      squares approximations with a linear base function. The final\u000d\u000a      approximation is arrived at using an adaptive selection and\u000d\u000a      regression-based model assembly [5]. This research in the UoA has been\u000d\u000a      funded jointly by TSB, Rolls-Royce and Airbus.\u000d\u000a    Another aspect of fundamental research has been the development of the\u000d\u000a      methodology for the composite optimisation of large scale structures. This\u000d\u000a      optimisation problem is too large to be solvable by existing means and the\u000d\u000a      optimisation method (developed by Toropov and applied by researchers from\u000d\u000a      the School of Mechanical Engineering at Leeds) reduces this complexity to\u000d\u000a      a manageable level [6].

By catalysing\u000a      and informing improvements in several areas of that system, the research\u000a      outlined above has not only allowed transport providers to deliver better\u000a      &#8212; and often more cost effective &#8212; services, but has also improved users'\u000a      access to and experience of public transport. As such, it has enhanced\u000a      visitor and tourist experiences of London, encouraged wider take-up of\u000a      London's transport service, and helped improve the welfare and quality of\u000a      life of the millions of people who use those services every day,\u000a      particularly among those with mobility barriers.\u000a    London Underground &#8212; platform humps: The research on platform\u000a      humps formed the basis of recommendations London Underground used to\u000a      develop specifications for the installation of humps on the Victoria Line\u000a      upgrade (2010-2011), and on all other lines as they are upgraded. It found\u000a      that the design could be more flexible than previously thought and the\u000a      cost per hump reduced from the initial &#163;500,000 to &#163;300,000, with the\u000a      prospect of reducing it further to &#163;100,000.

[a]\u000a    The results of UCL's work on Thameslink 2000 ensured that, in\u000a      2008, the specifications UCL recommended were supplied to all bidders for\u000a      the train design and manufacture call for tenders. The Thameslink research\u000a      highlighted some issues that were then pursued by Network Rail with\u000a      Siemens as part of the final negotiations over the supply of these trains\u000a      [output 4, above]. The work was also a cornerstone of the House of Lords\u000a      Select Committee on Science and Technology Report on Government\u000a      Procurement (2011), in which Tyler's empirical approach to using\u000a      scientific facilities was praised as an example of best practice in\u000a      innovative procurement, rather than relying on computer models alone to\u000a      provide estimates [b]. The work has been made available to the Crossrail\u000a      team, with the DfT's Chief Scientific Advisor recommending they adopt a\u000a      similar process (although at an earlier stage) for their trains [c].

For example, in 2012-13, London\u000a        Underground's use of PAMELA for the New Concept Deep Tube Train\u000a      Programme [d] was the first time they started to develop the concept from\u000a      the passenger perspective rather than the mechanical\/engineering\u000a      perspective. The results of the trials have enabled London Underground to\u000a      test and consider impacts on boarding and alighting rates resulting from\u000a      different options in the design of the internal and external details of\u000a      the train and the platform accoutrements (such as platform edge doors). As\u000a      a result, they have reduced the size of the doors on the new train design\u000a      to 1600mm, for inclusion in the project tender documents [e].\u000a    Shared road space, Exhibition Road, South Kensington: The work at\u000a      UCL allowed the resolution of concerns raised by the Guide Dogs for the\u000a      Blind Association about the safety of including a kerb-free,\u000a      single-surface space shared by pedestrians and vehicles within the local\u000a      borough's &#163;30 million redevelopment of Exhibition Road. UCL's research\u000a      findings were cited in a judicial review of the project in 2010 [f].

The full-scale facility, which was funded by EPSRC from 2003,\u000a      grew out of work conducted by Professor Nick Tyler (Chadwick Chair of\u000a      Civil Engineering; UCL 1987-present) for the Department of the\u000a      Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) in the mid-1990s. Tyler\u000a      conducts research into person-environment interactions, from the\u000a      macroscopic interactions within cities, transport and the built\u000a      environment systems to the microscopic interactions between stimuli in the\u000a      environment and the person's ability to manage the physical response.\u000a    EXCALIBUR (1998-2000): Having observed that wheelchair users and\u000a      older people could not board &#8212; and therefore did not use &#8212; new low-floor\u000a      buses, Tyler developed the EPSRC-funded EXCALIBUR project to work out how\u000a      to make these buses more accessible. A number of bus stops were\u000a      constructed using a variety of kerb and surface technologies, and then\u000a      tested for their effectiveness and ease of use by both drivers and\u000a      passengers [1]. This research led Tyler to develop a specific set of\u000a      design specifications for bus stops, allowing buses to stop at a maximum\u000a      distance of around 50mm &#8212; rather than the more common 400-500mm &#8212; from the\u000a      kerb [2].\u000a    PAMELA (2003-present): By enabling buses to get much closer to the\u000a      edge of the kerb, these new stop designs helped alleviate problems with\u000a      access directly to buses. They did not, however, address the problem of\u000a      how a disabled person might reach the bus stop in the first place over\u000a      footways that were often uneven, badly designed and inaccessible. Tyler\u000a      conceived PAMELA, a novel and highly flexible laboratory in which\u000a      pedestrian infrastructure could be built, changed, tested, reconfigured,\u000a      studied and their detailed design evaluated in terms of accessibility and\u000a      usability for pedestrians with a wide range of mobility levels and access\u000a      assistant requirements. The construction of the laboratory itself, which\u000a      took place between 2003 and 2006, required extensive design work based on\u000a      functional specifications by Tyler in relation to lighting facilities, and\u000a      the development of a flexible floor surface that retained sufficiently\u000a      stiff characteristics to be representative of ground conditions with\u000a      interchangeable real surface materials such as concrete pavers, stone, and\u000a      asphalt; could be tilted either as a whole surface or in part; and was\u000a      able to include specific elements of the pedestrian infrastructure,\u000a      including pedestrian crossings and bus stops, at full scale. He also\u000a      developed specifications for a range of sensing equipment.\u000a    Thameslink 2000 (2008-present): In 2008, early plans for the\u000a      &#163;3.5bn Thameslink 2000 railway line project revealed potential\u000a      incompatibility between the predicted level of demand and the proposed\u000a      service frequency. The Department for Transport asked Tyler to construct a\u000a      life-scale train carriage and station platform interface in the PAMELA\u000a      facility in order to test the boarding and alighting performance of the\u000a      proposed trains and passenger numbers [3]. The UCL team constructed a\u000a      mock-up life-size half carriage to Siemens' specification for stock for\u000a      the Thameslink 2000 project. The model had variable-width doors, moveable\u000a      seating, and a station environment that could be varied in terms of\u000a      platform heights. 150 participants were then recruited to board and alight\u000a      the carriage under different loading, boarding and alighting conditions.\u000a      Over 11,000 passenger movements were recorded. Various aspects were tested\u000a      under the predicted load scenarios, including the distribution of\u000a      passengers along the platforms in the four central London stations. The\u000a      research found that the proposed demand would not be met by the proposed\u000a      service frequency but that certain elements should be specified in the\u000a      requirements for the new trains in the procurement process in order to\u000a      minimise the problems. These specifications included door widths,\u000a      vestibule design and specified platform heights at stations. Network Rail\u000a      subsequently requested that UCL construct the train design being proposed\u000a      by Siemens as the preferred bidder for the project's train design [4].\u000a      Further work on passenger movements has been commissioned to run in\u000a      November 2013.\u000a    London Underground platform humps: In 2008 London Underground Ltd\u000a      asked Tyler to use PAMELA to examine their proposed platform humps, raised\u000a      sections of platform making it easier for wheelchair users, parents with\u000a      buggies and passengers with luggage to board and alight Underground\u000a      trains. In particular, Tyler was asked to evaluate potential safety issues\u000a      relating to the humps, including the risk of wheelchairs rolling down the\u000a      ramp onto the track, the likelihood of trains not stopping precisely, and\u000a      the ease with which visually impaired people could use them. To that end,\u000a      Tyler's team built a set of platform humps including multidirectional\u000a      slopes at different gradients, surfaces and markings. Tests conducted in\u000a      2008 with a variety of disabled research participants included evaluations\u000a      of the ease of their access onto and off a `train floor' at different\u000a      points on the gradients, and of whether or not proposed platform widths\u000a      accommodated wheelchair manoeuvrability. This data was used in subsequent\u000a      work between 2009 and 2010 to show that a time reduction of 3 seconds in\u000a      the dwell time (the time the train is stationary in the station), which\u000a      allowed the same train frequency with one fewer train, could be achieved\u000a      by reducing the vertical gap between the train and the platform along the\u000a      entire length of the platform [5],[6],[7].\u000a    London Underground New Concept Deep Tube Train: In 2012\/13, London\u000a      Underground commissioned the laboratory to develop a mock-up train for\u000a      their New Concept Deep Tube Train Programme. In this case, a life-size\u000a      full tube train carriage was constructed according to the current\u000a      conceptual design, but with passenger-facing innovations such as variable\u000a      door widths, interchangeable seating and grab poles, and a station\u000a      environment including variable platform heights and platform edge doors.\u000a      This was then tested with 120 participants boarding and alighting under\u000a      different loading conditions. [9]\u000a    Tubelines Ltd (2009): Research carried out for Tubelines tested\u000a      the feasibility of using portable ramps to enable wheelchair users to\u000a      enter and leave tube trains. The work, which involved constructing a\u000a      number of deep-tube mock-ups tested by wheelchair users and other\u000a      participants, demonstrated that the proposed ramps were not appropriate,\u000a      as the ramps took too long to deploy and were particularly challenging\u000a      where the train floor is lower than the platform surface.\u000a    Exhibition Road (2010-2011): In 2010, Guide Dogs for the Blind\u000a      Association and Transport for London asked UCL to test a variety of\u000a      horizontal warning systems for the kerb-free, single-surface shared road\u000a      space in Exhibition Road, home to the Natural History Museum, Science\u000a      Museum and Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. The Association was particularly\u000a      concerned about the safety of a kerb- free, single-surface space shared by\u000a      pedestrians and vehicles without segregation. The work carried out in\u000a      PAMELA tested 54 different designs for tactile horizontal delineation\u000a      intended to provide information to visually impaired people about the\u000a      location of safe and less-safe areas within the shared space. These were\u000a      tested with a sample of visually impaired people, wheelchair users,\u000a      ambulant elderly people and others to determine which design should be\u000a      used in the actual application. It found no clear winner, but showed that\u000a      the existing `corduroy' surface might be usable for this purpose,\u000a      recommending a width of 600mm [8].\u000a    Other members of the team: Dr Taku Fujiyama (Lecturer at UCL since 2004);\u000a      Dr Craig Childs (Research Associate at UCL, 2003-2013)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35392","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In summary, the research carried out by WEDC resulted in the design and\u000d\u000a      implementation of significant aspects of NWSC's change-management\u000d\u000a      programmes (2000-2011). This produced improved access to water services\u000d\u000a      for existing customers and increased numbers of new customers (an\u000d\u000a      additional 526,000 people, including 196,000 residents in the urban\u000d\u000a      informal settlements, in all of NWSC's service areas), all of which\u000d\u000a      received a better service in terms of quantity and quality of water\u000d\u000a      received. Most impact of this research has occurred since 2008.\u000d\u000a    Implementation of the project Serving all urban consumers, led by\u000d\u000a      Loughborough University (Sansom, Kayaga, Coates and Njiri) produced\u000d\u000a      guidelines for getting to know and understand all consumer groups [R3];\u000d\u000a      targeting and providing differentiated services to low-income consumers;\u000d\u000a      and developing and implementing a strategic marketing approach to service\u000d\u000a      delivery [R1]. Specifically, this research influenced NWSC\u000d\u000a      management to set up the Urban Pro-Poor Unit in Kampala [C1]. This\u000d\u000a      in turn led to improved utility services to the urban poor. For instance,\u000d\u000a      in low-income poor settlements, the number of people served increased from\u000d\u000a      923,600 in 2008, to about 1,120,000 in 2010 [C1, C2, C3]. Improved\u000d\u000a      access to water in turn led to improved quality of life and enhanced\u000d\u000a      economic opportunities [C4].\u000d\u000a    Improved Risk Assessment and Management of Piped Urban Water Supplies\u000d\u000a      was a joint action-research project carried out by WEDC, NWSC and Makerere\u000d\u000a      University (Uganda). Through this action research, the procedures for\u000d\u000a      water-quality management in NWSC were revised in 2007 to incorporate water\u000d\u000a      safety plans (WSPs). Since 2007, implementation has been rolled out to\u000d\u000a      other service areas [C4]. The result has been delivery of\u000d\u000a      better-quality water services to urban consumers in Uganda (Figure 1\u000d\u000a      below), leading directly to enhanced health of the population.\u000d\u000a    The researchers shared the findings they made in the Charging to\u000d\u000a        enter the water shop? project with senior NWSC managers in April\u000d\u000a      2004. The findings on the connection expenses to poor urban dwellers and\u000d\u000a      on other related barriers to uptake convinced NWSC to revise its policy\u000d\u000a      and procedures for effecting new connections [C5]. In particular,\u000d\u000a      they simplified the process and offered new financial incentives to\u000d\u000a      applicants. As a result, the number of connections increased significantly\u000d\u000a      from 202,559 in 1998 to 272,406 in 2011 (Figure 2), a 34% increase.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the estimated population benefiting from these new\u000d\u000a      connections increased by 28% to 2,426,000, with an additional 526,000\u000d\u000a      individuals benefiting in this area alone.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aFigure 1: Number of water quality samples conforming to WHO standards [Sources C2, C6, C7]\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aFigure 2: Improvements in access to urban water services [Sources C2, C7]\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    NWSC's change-management programmes &#8212; based on WEDC research &#8212; had four\u000d\u000a      significant types of positive impacts with huge outreach:\u000d\u000a    i. Existing customers received better quality water services and customer\u000d\u000a      care, which increased their willingness to pay for water services [C2,\u000d\u000a        C3, C5]\u000d\u000a    ii. The number of new customers increased, mainly due to simplified\u000d\u000a      connection procedures, financial incentives, better customer service and\u000d\u000a      positive word of mouth from existing customers [C2, C3, C5, C7]\u000d\u000a    iii. Through a combination of i and ii, the revenue base of NWSC\u000d\u000a      increased significantly, which greatly contributed to their improved\u000d\u000a      institutional capacity, launching NWSC into a virtuous circle of\u000d\u000a      organisational performance. For example, NWSC's turnover increased by 31%\u000d\u000a      from Uganda Shs. 100.6 billion (&#163;24.4m) in 2008 to 131.5 billion (&#163;31.9m)\u000d\u000a      in 2011 [C2, C7]\u000d\u000a    iv. NWSC implementation of the urban pro-poor policy and programmes led\u000d\u000a      to significant improvements in water services delivery to informal urban\u000d\u000a      settlements [C1, C3, C4]\u000d\u000a    The improvements in water services had more far-reaching impacts on\u000d\u000a      residents living in poor urban settlements [C1, C2, C3, C4].

The researchers produced and disseminated\u000d\u000a      resulting sets of guidelines on how water utilities, working with other\u000d\u000a      key stakeholders, can meet the needs and demands of urban water consumers,\u000d\u000a      particularly poor households [R1, R2, R3].\u000d\u000a    In the second project, Improved Risk Assessment and Management of\u000d\u000a        Piped Urban Water Supplies ([G2], 2002-2004), the researchers\u000d\u000a      developed and validated a methodology for implementing Water Safety Plans\u000d\u000a      (WSPs). These are quality-assurance processes for effective risk\u000d\u000a      management in water distribution systems in developing countries. Using\u000d\u000a      piped distribution networks in Kampala and Jinja (Uganda) and Guntor\u000d\u000a      (India) as case studies, the researchers disseminated to water utilities\u000d\u000a      in developing countries four sets of guidelines for developing and\u000d\u000a      implementing WSPs [R4, R5].\u000d\u000a    In the third project, Charging to enter the water shop? ([G3],\u000d\u000a      2003-2004, in collaboration with Cranfield University), the WEDC\u000d\u000a      researchers conducted a case study in the Ugandan cities of Jinja and\u000d\u000a      Kampala. Their aim was to determine the cost of urban piped water\u000d\u000a      connections for the poor and how charges are normally made for it. The\u000d\u000a      research demonstrated the true magnitude of the barriers to connection\u000d\u000a      experienced by the urban poor. The researchers discovered that the mean\u000d\u000a      cost for a new water connection was about US$500, which was unaffordable\u000d\u000a      for low-income households, with an average income of $2 per day [R6].\u000d\u000a    Based on these research findings, which were published in leading\u000d\u000a      journals, new service delivery models were developed, as part of NWSC's\u000d\u000a      change management programme, and embedded into the utility's policies and\u000d\u000a      practices, which has resulted into improved service quality and extension\u000d\u000a      of water services to those previously un-served.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35394","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Incorporation of the research findings in US Transportation Research\u000d\u000a      Board guidelines [C1, C2] has changed practices of RESA design and\u000d\u000a      evaluation [C3, C4, C5] and led to improvements in RESA design at\u000d\u000a      three airports [C4, C5]. This has directly improved the safety of\u000d\u000a      the 74+ million annual passengers, 830,000 aircraft movements, and tens of\u000d\u000a      thousands of airport workers and local residents at these sites [C6]\u000d\u000a      by informing and improving airport safety modelling and management systems\u000d\u000a      [C4, C5]. The research underpinned Pitfield's contribution as\u000d\u000a      Evidence in Chief at the 2011 UK planning inquiry concerning the proposed\u000d\u000a      expansion of London Ashford Airport, near Dungeness nuclear power\u000d\u000a      stations. Pitfield's evidence enhanced public and practitioner\u000d\u000a      understandings of the risks of aircraft accidents on and near airports and\u000d\u000a      contributed to the Office for Nuclear Regulation's (ONR) decision in 2012\u000d\u000a      to review how the risk aircraft pose to nuclear safety is evaluated. In\u000d\u000a      October 2013, Pitfield, Budd and Gleave were contracted to undertake\u000d\u000a      external research with the UK Health and Safety Executive in Support of\u000d\u000a      the ONR Chief Inspector's Evaluation of Accidental Aircraft Crash risk and\u000d\u000a      develop a new off-airport crash model [C7].\u000d\u000a    Public and practitioner dissemination of the research at the ATRS Annual\u000d\u000a      Conference in Brazil in 2005 attracted attention from the Brazilian Civil\u000d\u000a      Aviation Authority (BCAA). Following the move of a BCAA employee to\u000d\u000a      US-based consultancy Applied Research Associates (ARA), Pitfield and\u000d\u000a      colleagues at Loughborough University developed and won a joint bid with\u000d\u000a      ARA for funding from the US Airport Cooperative Research Program to\u000d\u000a      implement their research [C3].\u000d\u000a    The resulting international academic\/industry collaboration directly led\u000d\u000a      to the publication of ACRP Report 3 Analysis of Aircraft Overruns and\u000d\u000a        Undershoots for Runway Safety Areas in 2008. This report details a\u000d\u000a      nine-step procedure for evaluating a RESA to determine the probability\u000d\u000a      that an incident will occur during aircraft operations at or near an\u000d\u000a      airport with severe consequences [C1]. This procedure, underpinned\u000d\u000a      by the Loughborough team's research, is now widely known as 'ACRP 3'. In\u000d\u000a      ACRP Report 50, published in 2011, ARA extended ACRP 3, adding, among\u000d\u000a      other things, a freely-available risk-analysis software tool for\u000d\u000a      calculating the risk associated with RESA designs [C2].\u000d\u000a    To comply with new national regulations, US airports must enhance their\u000d\u000a      RESAs to meet FAA design standards by the end of 2015. In pursuit of this,\u000d\u000a      San Francisco International Airport (SFO) proposed a set of RESA\u000d\u000a      development alternatives and commissioned ARA to evaluate them using ACRP\u000d\u000a      3 (2009-2010). SFO needed to quantify the extent to which each\u000d\u000a      non-standard alternative would reduce the risk of severe accident\u000d\u000a      consequences and compare this with the risk reduction that would be\u000d\u000a      realised were SFO able to implement standard RESA designs. The first phase\u000d\u000a      of SFO's RESA-development program began in 2012 with completion\u000d\u000a      anticipated in 2014 [C4]. The fatal Asiana Airlines Boeing 777\u000d\u000a      undershoot at SFO on 6th July 2013 illustrated the vital\u000d\u000a      importance of this work.\u000d\u000a    In Canada, new regulations regarding RESAs are currently being drafted by\u000d\u000a      Transport Canada following recommendations from the Canadian\u000d\u000a      Transportation Safety Board. Like SFO in the US, the Greater Toronto\u000d\u000a      Airports Authority (GTAA) used ACRP 3 and ACRP 50 as the principal sources\u000d\u000a      for its assessment of risks associated with the RESA designs proposed for\u000d\u000a      Toronto Pearson International Airport. The process culminated in an option\u000d\u000a      for each runway end and the recommendation that an engineered materials\u000d\u000a      arrestor system be installed. The GTAA board of directors adopted the\u000d\u000a      recommendations and implementation will be completed in 2015 [C5].\u000d\u000a    In 2011, the UK Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government\u000d\u000a      called in a planning application for expansion of London Ashford (Lydd)\u000d\u000a      Airport. Pitfield participated in the subsequent public inquiry [C8]\u000d\u000a      as an expert witness for Lydd Airport Action Group (LAAG). In his proof of\u000d\u000a      evidence, he explained how the methodology could be applied to Lydd. He\u000d\u000a      estimated the risk posed by the proposed airport expansion of an aircraft\u000d\u000a      crashing into one of the nuclear power stations at Dungeness and\u000d\u000a      contrasted the sophisticated Loughborough model with the Byrne model, a UK\u000d\u000a      industry standard for risk assessments. Permission for the airport's\u000d\u000a      expansion has recently been granted. Following criticism from Pitfield and\u000d\u000a      others of the Byrne model, the Office for Nuclear Regulation convened an\u000d\u000a      independent technical advisory panel (TAP) in 2012 to provide advice on\u000d\u000a      aircraft crash hazards in relation to nuclear safety. Pitfield was asked\u000d\u000a      to participate in the TAP from November 2012 [C9]. Public\u000d\u000a      awareness of the importance of aircraft-accident modelling has been\u000d\u000a      enhanced by: Pitfield's participation in the public inquiry and the\u000d\u000a      publication of articles referring to his evidence in the Kentish\u000d\u000a        Express local newspaper and in the print and online editions of The\u000a        Guardian national newspaper [C10] and Gleave's interviews on\u000d\u000a      Sky News, BBC News, Al Jazeera and Channel News Asia (2012 and 2013) on\u000d\u000a      the subject of aircraft safety incidents.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A new method for classifying aircraft accidents and modelling the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of runway end safety areas was developed by Pitfield and\u000d\u000a      colleagues at Loughborough University (1997-present) to improve global\u000d\u000a      airfield safety.

However, serious deficiencies in existing\u000d\u000a      RESA assessment techniques were evident as they only considered a\u000d\u000a      restricted number of variables and had limited modelling capability. Few\u000d\u000a      methodologies could accurately quantify the risk of an aircraft accident\u000d\u000a      occurring on or near an airport and those that could focused solely on the\u000d\u000a      interests of specific stakeholders, considered few risk factors, seldom\u000d\u000a      analysed normal airside operations' risk exposure, and were incapable of\u000d\u000a      quantifying the criticality of risk factors or using them to assess the\u000d\u000a      likelihood of accident occurrence.

The team produced peer-reviewed publications [R1]\u000d\u000a      and won a further research grant (EPSRC, 2003-2006, G2). Another\u000d\u000a      researcher, Wong (1 October 2003 &#8212; 4 July 2007), then extended the early\u000d\u000a      research and obtained his PhD in 2007. Further peer-reviewed outputs,\u000d\u000a      which distinguished four accident categories &#8212; overrun, undershoot,\u000d\u000a      veer-off, and take-off and crash, were published [R4, R5]. EPSRC\u000d\u000a      reviewers considered this research internationally leading in 2007 [R2,\u000a        R4, R5]. The Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) &#8212; a US\u000d\u000a      organisation sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to\u000d\u000a      develop practical solutions for airport operators &#8212; funded further\u000d\u000a      research [G3] and adopted the new methodology [R3]. Eight\u000d\u000a      North American airports have validated it and three have applied it\u000d\u000a      directly &#8212; San Francisco and Toronto Pearson International Airports and\u000d\u000a      Ugnu-Kuparuk Airport, Alaska (2009-2010).\u000d\u000a    A new and comprehensive database detailing all commercial aircraft\u000d\u000a      accidents that occurred within a 10 nautical mile radius of airfields\u000d\u000a      between 1982 and 2002 was compiled from 440 National Transportation Safety\u000d\u000a      Board accident reports and a new accident taxonomy was developed. This\u000d\u000a      enabled valid statistical comparisons to be made within individual\u000d\u000a      accident categories for the first time in Kirkland's research on overruns\u000d\u000a      [R1]. Loughborough researchers identified statistically significant\u000d\u000a      trends and assessed the prevalence of particular risk factors for specific\u000d\u000a      accident types. These included variables that had not been examined in\u000d\u000a      previous studies such as weather conditions [R2]. In the second\u000d\u000a      stage of the bivariate analysis, relative accident involvement ratios were\u000d\u000a      calculated to quantify the accident propensity of flights under different\u000d\u000a      conditions and levels of risk exposure. In the final stage they calibrated\u000d\u000a      a series of logistic regressions on individual risk factors to obtain odds\u000d\u000a      and risk ratios for accident occurrence. Using multivariate modelling,\u000d\u000a      they examined the performance of different aircraft, local airport and\u000d\u000a      topographic conditions, and the point of first impact and final wreckage\u000d\u000a      location for the four accident types [R4, R5]. The resulting\u000d\u000a      predictive power is vastly superior to that of previous methodologies and\u000d\u000a      has global reach and significance (evidenced by R6 and Section 5).\u000d\u000a      Research to further advance the capabilities of the model are currently\u000d\u000a      being conducted by Pitfield, Budd (Senior Lecturer, 2013-present) and\u000d\u000a      Gleave (Researcher, 1 October 2012 &#8212; to date).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35835","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact is epitomised by Vardy's services through Dundee Tunnel\u000a      Research (DTR)[9],\u000a      specialising in air flow in road and rail tunnels and embracing software\u000a      licensing, design\u000a      consultancy, research and the promotion of tunnel safety. The impact is\u000a      economic (cost savings\u000a      achieved by optimum design), environmental and societal (facilitating\u000a      \"clean\" transport systems\u000a      and reducing fossil fuel pollution) and health-related (improving\u000a      passenger comfort and tunnel\u000a      safety). Licences for ThermoTun granted by the university and DTR\u000a      are targeted expressly at\u000a      knowledgeable users offering a specialist service to their clients[10,11,12,13].\u000a      Since 2008, licences\u000a      have been granted in Austria, Hong Kong, Korea, Spain, Switzerland, UK and\u000a      USA. MPVC is\u000a      licensed only in Japan and Vardy provides technical expertise for each\u000a      application[14]. The oil-related\u000a\u0009  software PipePulse is licensed exclusively to a Scottish\u000a      company, Paradigm Flow\u000a      Services[15].\u000a    ThermoTun is regarded internationally as \"the top software\u000a      available for 1-D simulations of rapidly-varying\u000a      pressure, velocity and temperature in railway tunnels\"[12].\u000a      Since 2008, it has been used in\u000a      the design of many of the largest tunnels in the world[16,17],\u000a      including the 57km Gotthard Base and\u000a      35km L&#246;tschberg Base tunnels (Switzerland); the 28km Guadarrama and 25km\u000a      Pajares tunnels\u000a      (Spain), the 18km Fehmarn Link (Denmark-Germany) and high speed lines\u000a      under design or\u000a      construction in China, Korea, continental Europe and the UK. ThermoTun\u000a      has also been used for\u000a      an ultra-high-speed Munich Mag-Lev Railway, more than 200 shorter high\u000a      speed tunnels\u000a      worldwide and more than 30 metro systems. It is regarded by UK Rail\u000a      Standards &amp; Safety Board\u000a      as being \"without peer in predicting aerodynamic effects of trains\u000a      travelling in underground tunnel\u000a      systems\"[13]. MPVC is currently used to control seven\u000a      long road tunnels in Japan[14], including the\u000a      two longest (11km Kan-Etsu, 11km Hida), where it has delivered large\u000a      savings in power\u000a      consumption.\u000a    Impact is evident through Vardy's frequent involvement in design,\u000a      predominantly at the feasibility\u000a      stage, when it is still possible for current research to have a\u000a      significant influence on the eventual\u000a      outcome. This is also the stage at which the need for new research is most\u000a      easily identified. Thus,\u000a      the need to understand sonic booms from tunnels led to long-standing\u000a      research on unsteady\u000a      friction and on wave flows over porous media (ballast-track rail).\u000a      Likewise, concern about\u000a      excessive temperatures (&gt; 50&#176;C) in tunnels under the Alps led to\u000a      research having impact on\u000a      prediction of heat conduction in seepage flows around tunnels. Exposure to\u000a      practical tunnel\u000a      operation led to research on model-based ventilation control and new\u000a      proposals for safe ventilation\u000a      in the event of fire. All have fed back into practical design. For\u000a      designers, the impact of these\u000a      activities occurs at the design stage whereas, for constructors, it occurs\u000a      a few years later. For\u000a      users, it occurs many years later (and is then on-going). For instance,\u000a      current high speed rail\u000a      design for the UK[16,13] is directly influenced by Vardy's\u000a      publications and by a ThermoTun licensee,\u000a      but passengers and people close to portals will not benefit until 2025 or\u000a      beyond. Arup confirm[11]\u000a      that Vardy's research on aural pressure comfort is the critical factor in\u000a      optimising tunnel sizes and\u000a      thereby achieving savings for national governments of \"tens or hundreds of\u000a      millions of pounds\"[11] in\u000a      unnecessary expenditure.\u000a    The development of MPVC was triggered by a realisation that, in\u000a      many tunnels, ventilation control\u000a      systems were highly wasteful of power and often failed to achieve the\u000a      desired conditions. Vardy's\u000a      paper with Ichikawa[1] led to strong interest in Japan where\u000a      there are thousands of road tunnels.\u000a      The Japan Highway Public Corporation (now NEXCO) now regards MPVC\u000a      as its preferred control\u000a      system for long highway tunnels and is installing it at the rate of about\u000a      one tunnel per year. Design\u000a      services are provided by Sohatsu Ltd with project-specific guidance from\u000a      Vardy[14,18]. This link with\u000a      Sohatsu has evolved to include further research underpinning the\u000a      development of a new system\u000a      (FCVC) now used successfully in simpler tunnels than those for\u000a      which MPVC is installed[14]. FCVC\u000a      provides automatic control in a fire emergency, with special (but not\u000a      exclusive) application in bi-directional\u000a      tunnels with no exhaust shafts.\u000a    Impact in the oil industry is through Paradigm Flow Solutions, an SME\u000a      that specialises in detecting,\u000a      locating and removing restrictions and blockages from offshore pipelines.\u000a      Typical lines are tens of\u000a      kilometres long and diameters range from 15mm-250mm. Paradigm's work\u000a      focuses on the\u000a      common case when access for intervention is possible only at the ends of\u000a      the long lines. Vardy's\u000a      inverse-transient software enables the mapping of local and distributed\u000a      blockages. The long-term\u000a      research on unsteady friction is informing methods of removing the\u000a      blockages and, more recently,\u000a      in preventing their development.

In typical simulations with ThermoTun, dozens\u000a      of such crossing events occur. A\u000a      fundamental choice has to be made between methods that are potentially\u000a      accurate at boundaries,\u000a      but poorer between them and methods that are accurate between boundaries,\u000a      but poorer at them.\u000a      Likewise, generic choices are inevitable between accuracy and robustness.\u000a      In software intended\u000a      for general purposes in design offices, neither is sufficient without the\u000a      other. These issues have\u000a      driven much of Vardy's numerical research[5] and underpin its\u000a      practical acceptance. No alternative\u000a      software can match the accuracy and robustness of ThermoTun, MPVC\u000a      and PipePulse.\u000a    Until about 10 years ago, Dundee's tunnel research focussed on the\u000a      amplitudes of transient\u000a      events. These determine pressure comfort inside trains and pollution\u000a      concentrations in road\u000a      tunnels, for example. The focus has since widened to include a far more\u000a      detailed phenomenon,\u000a      namely the evolving shapes of propagating wavefronts. These determine\u000a      whether tunnels will emit\u000a      sonic booms into the surrounding atmosphere[4]. For this\u000a      purpose, it is necessary to model[2,3]\u000a      unsteady skin friction on pipe\/tunnel walls and this requires detailed\u000a      understanding of\u000a      wave\/boundary-layer interactions. Unsteady skin fiction is inherently 3D\u000a      in nature[8]. Axial\u000a      accelerations\/decelerations of the mean flow induce changes to radial\u000a      velocity gradients which, in\u000a      turn, cause redistributions of turbulence in all three coordinate\u000a      directions. Dundee works closely\u000a      with teams at the Universities of Aberdeen and Sheffield, using detailed\u000a      physical experiments and\u000a      extensive 3D numerical simulations (DNS, LES &amp; RANS) to investigate\u000a      the inherent characteristics\u000a      of turbulence in non-equilibrium flows[6,7]. This underpins the\u000a      development of generic methods of\u000a      modelling rapidly varying wall shear stresses in highly unsteady flows.\u000a    Another research focus has been on the use of inverse transient analysis.\u000a      Instead of predicting\u000a      pressure\/velocity histories for known geometrical and kinematic\u000a      conditions, this involves\u000a      \"predicting\" (inferring) geometrical and kinematic conditions for known (i.e.\u000a      measured)\u000a      pressure\/velocity histories[8]. It is inherently impossible to\u000a      do this with 100% reliability even in the\u000a      absence of inevitable noise in the measured signals, but the research is\u000a      showing how to\u000a      distinguish between fundamentally different causes (e.g. friction\u000a      or area change) of closely similar\u000a      measurements.\u000a    The research on tunnel airflows has extended into a method of controlling\u000a      tunnel ventilation\u000a      equipment in real time[1]. Whereas conventional tunnel control\u000a      is usually based on empirical feed-back\u000a\u0009  and\/or feed-forward algorithms, MPVC maintains an on-line simulator\u000a      of current conditions\u000a      throughout the tunnel network, allowing for exhaust emissions from\u000a      measured traffic flows. The\u000a      simulator is used to predict future conditions based on trial fan\u000a      operations and an optimisation\u000a      method selects the case that gives the most desirable outcome. The biggest\u000a      academic challenge is\u000a      to maintain compatibility between the simulated and actual conditions in\u000a      the tunnel systems even\u000a      though the input to the model cannot be perfect (e.g. vehicle dynamics,\u000a      exhaust emission rates,\u000a      errors in sensors).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35836","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Whole Life Consultants Ltd (WLC)\u000d\u000a    WLC was established as a spin-out company from the University of Dundee\u000d\u000a      (which owns a 10% share) specifically to commercialise the research\u000d\u000a      outputs from the CMRU on the recommendation of the industrial steering\u000d\u000a      committee for EPSRC Grant GR\/N01811\/01.

Moreover, for\u000d\u000a      projects of similar types, the cost-significant items are all the same and\u000d\u000a      represent a consistent proportion of the total value. The property is\u000d\u000a      generic and can be applied to any set of numbers (e.g. labour costs,\u000d\u000a      labour hours), allowing the derivation of a small number of significant\u000d\u000a      activities that can be taken to be representative of overall project\u000d\u000a      performance. This finding has allowed the execution of extensive site data\u000d\u000a      collection programmes, leading, in turn, to a deeper understanding of\u000d\u000a      where the opportunities for increasing productivity lie[1][2].\u000d\u000a      The CMRU has, for the first time, quantified the relationship between\u000d\u000a      productivity and delays and disruptions, overtime working and size and\u000d\u000a      skills of the labour force[3]. It has demonstrated conclusively\u000d\u000a      the role of site management in improving productivity and developed a\u000d\u000a      protocol for collaborative planning drawing on lean principles and\u000d\u000a      involving the whole supply chain that is similar to (but pre-dates) \"last\u000d\u000a      planner\".\u000d\u000a    In whole life costing, CMRU developed a generic approach to life cycle\u000d\u000a      costing and explored the potential for adopting a risk-based approach to\u000d\u000a      maximising whole life value by applying Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)\u000d\u000a      to construction projects in both the design and operation phases[4].\u000d\u000a      Two techniques were identified, namely (i) Failure Modes, Effects and\u000d\u000a      Criticality Analysis and (ii) Reliability Centred Maintenance that could\u000d\u000a      be tailored for and applied successfully in the construction industry. The\u000d\u000a      research demonstrated how the application of these techniques reduces the\u000d\u000a      maintenance costs of existing housing stock by up to 20% and the whole\u000d\u000a      life costs of selected components of houses, hospitals, schools and\u000d\u000a      prisons by up to 40%. The research also led to the development of an\u000d\u000a      elemental whole life cost breakdown structure consistent across all phases\u000d\u000a      of the project, allowing, for the first time, an analysis of the impact of\u000d\u000a      alternative design solutions on the capital, maintenance and operating\u000d\u000a      costs of any building project[5].\u000d\u000a    Since 2005, the CMRU has developed an Integrated Sustainability\u000d\u000a      Assessment Toolkit that allows the holistic assessment of the economic,\u000d\u000a      environmental and social dimensions of sustainability throughout the life\u000d\u000a      of any construction asset or group of assets. From the 1000 or so\u000d\u000a      sustainability indicators in use worldwide, the research has identified 19\u000d\u000a      principal sustainability impacts of buildings and 27 principal impacts of\u000d\u000a      urban developments that practitioners and academics considered to be the\u000d\u000a      most important. It also identified the most appropriate tools for\u000d\u000a      assessing the impacts and developed a multi-criteria decision-making\u000d\u000a      approach to aggregate the outputs across all the principal impacts[6].\u000d\u000a    Horner (Director, CMRU) was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal\u000d\u000a      Incorporation of Architects in Scotland for \"Services to Construction\" in\u000d\u000a      2007.

It was\u000a      calculated [R6] that treating effluent using conventional\u000a      wastewater treatment requires about 800 KWh per wet tonne, up from 500KWh\u000a      in 2005.\u000a    The immediate impact from this research has been to demonstrate new\u000a      technology that provides renewable energy whilst reducing wastewater and\u000a      greenhouse-gas emissions. Dissemination throughout the food and processing\u000a      industry will have significant economic and sustainability benefits. Our\u000a      partners, Unilever, have pioneered this application (R1) led by its\u000a      commitment to innovation and sustainability. Reducing waste at food\u000a      processing sites is a priority during any major investment or\u000a      refurbishment. The Marmite plant generates 15 tonnes of high-strength\u000a      food-processing effluent an hour round the clock and if the company were\u000a      to discharge this into the sewer it would cost more than &#163;0.5m per annum.\u000a      This was one of the alternatives, which were either to discharge to the\u000a      Utility for treatment, to build a conventional tried and tested but carbon\u000a      intensive plant, or to use the risky, anaerobic digestion technology.\u000a      Other questions that arose were whether all or only part of their\u000a      wastewater should be treated and if they should outsource operation of a\u000a      waste treatment plant.\u000a    Analysis of these alternatives started in 2005 against the backdrop of\u000a      the renewable-energy incentives offered by the UKs commitment to reducing\u000a      carbon emissions and the enhancement of support for recycling. Unilever\u000a      enlisted Wheatley's help in their decision-making based on his previous\u000a      contributions to solving waste problems at this and other sites.\u000a    Loughborough's work was fundamental to the feasibility and\u000a      decision-making meetings at Unilever (2005), at which the main\u000a      effluent-management options were compared and enumerated. A major\u000a      contribution was quantifying and reducing the risk from using innovative\u000a      technology for energy and water recovery. The uncertainty arose because\u000a      anaerobic reactors had rarely been used for treating industrial wastewater\u000a      in the UK and where they had, problems were reported. The incentives\u000a      however suggested site specific work and Unilever fully funded\u000a      Shelton-Smith at Loughborough [G4] to work out what would be\u000a      required to successfully adapt anaerobic digestion to the Marmite site.\u000a      Wheatley and Shelton-Smith were able to use the previous research [R3]\u000a      on how to characterise the variable nature of food-production effluents to\u000a      optimise anaerobic digestion. Monitoring of the waste in this way was used\u000a      to suggest the best process-flow sheet to achieve reliability and\u000a      sustainability. Using these data and their experience with anaerobic\u000a      treatment of other wastes, the research team shortlisted the most\u000a      promising reactor designs and pre-treatment techniques.\u000a    In all, the researchers worked with, contractors and other technical\u000a      experts from the Unilever group from 2005-2009 to detail the design and\u000a      commissioning. Extensive testing was crucial to gaining the confidence of\u000a      Unilever senior management in this untried approach to effluent-treatment.\u000a      They financed the research and based on the results, investment was\u000a      approved and &#163;4m spent in 2009 on construction of a plant for energy and\u000a      water recovery implementing the treatment process developed and\u000a      established at Loughborough [R4].\u000a    Wheatley and Shelton-Smith advised in the competitive procurement process\u000a      organised by Unilever to select the contractor and subcontractor.\u000a      Loughborough researcher Theaker was appointed by Unilever in 2008 to lead\u000a      the commissioning of the plant, which has been operating successfully to\u000a      date [C1, C2, C3].\u000a    The impact and reach of the research extends well beyond the Unilever\u000a      application. Our innovative procedures provide a practicable and\u000a      fundamentally different approach to the design of anaerobic wastewater\u000a      treatment plants. Our approach simplified the reaction rate model through\u000a      radical changes to waste characterisation and monitoring procedures;\u000a      (three instead of thirty parameters). The procedure is easy to use and is\u000a      to be incorporated as an update to the mechanistic International Water\u000a      Association model and described to the industry by the Foundation for\u000a      Water Research, the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental\u000a      Management and Institution of Civil Engineers design guidelines to new\u000a      bioreactor designs. These are the standard guidelines for practitioners\u000a      working in the &#163;500m food waste processing sector.\u000a    The research had significant economic impact realised through the new\u000a      wastewater-treatment plant's production of biogas and clean water.\u000a      Unilever uses the biogas to produce energy, which currently the company\u000a      uses directly on site. Unilever have made the business case for further\u000a      investment for gas storage with the prospect of feeding electricity from\u000a      the plant into the national distribution network. Water from the treatment\u000a      plant is pure enough to be recycled for multiple uses. Excluding running\u000a      costs, the plant saved &#163;0.9m in 2012, a figure projected to increase year\u000a      on year, particularly with energy price rises.\u000a    The new Marmite wastewater-treatment plant also makes a substantial\u000a      contribution to sustainability including the replacement of fossil fuel\u000a      from power generation estimated to be more than 10 million tonnes of CO2\u000a      per year [C1]. The other environmental benefits are the reduction\u000a      in the volume and strength of effluent discharged to the sewer, which is\u000a      reducing the risk of odour, sewer overflows and overloads as climate\u000a      changes generates more intensive rainfall. Current research focusses on\u000a      recovery of other materials as well as water and gas, particularly\u000a      nitrogen and phosphorus from the solids residues.\u000a    Unilever are working to extend the approach that we have pioneered at\u000a      Marmite to other Unilever food-processing plants across Europe, making use\u000a      of the EU wide incentives for renewable energy. The new procedures adopted\u000a      at Marmite have delivered a 10% reduction in operating costs through the\u000a      generation of renewable energy (20% of site use) and lowered\u000a      effluent-treatment costs by 90% [C1].\u000a    Through their participation in the research (doctoral and post-doctoral),\u000a      five researchers have been able to disseminate these developments in the\u000a      engineering of anaerobic treatment and industrial effluent management.\u000a      Shelton-Smith and Theaker were employed by Unilever as a result of these\u000a      research outcomes and to apply the technology to other company's sites [C1].\u000a      Fell and two others work for other companies in the water industry.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research into a new waste treatment process model at Loughborough\u000a      University (1993 to date) has resulted in the following benefits for\u000a      Unilever:\u000a    \u000a      Savings of &#163;2m for wastewater treatment over the last 4 years\u000a      In 2012 additional savings of &#163;0.2m from biogas and &#163;0.1m in water\u000a        supply and landfill costs\u000a      A reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 10 million tonnes (2012)\u000a        from the substitution of fossil fuels\u000a      Significant reductions in the risks of spills, sewer overloads and the\u000a        recycling of scarce resources, namely water and fertilizer\u000a      Newly developed underpinning generic principles to be incorporated in\u000a        updated designs and guides for users (to be published by Foundation for\u000a        Water Research\/ICE\/CIWEM)\u000a      Researchers (five) being employed as a direct result of the\u000a        specialised expertise gained and their ability to provide similar\u000a        benefits to other sectors of industry\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    Loughborough University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Loughborough University","InstitutionName":"Loughborough University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10004113}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1 Monroy, O., Johnson, K.A., Wheatley, A.D., Hawkes, F. and Caine, M.\u000a      (1994) \"The Anaerobic Filtration of Dairy Waste: Results of a Pilot\u000a      Trial\", Bioresource Technology, 50 (3), 243-251, ISBN 0950 9623,\u000a      doi: 10.1016\/0960-8524(94)90097-3\u000a    \u000a\u000aR2 Johnson, KA, Wheatley, AD, Monroy, O (1994) \"Mixing and Solids\u000a        Accumulation in Anaerobic Filters.

These were the most commonly reported cause of the problems\u000a      with the traditional applications of anaerobic digestion to treat domestic\u000a      sewage and agricultural wastes. The result was a technique that was\u000a      mathematically simple and easy to validate without the need for exotic\u000a      equipment, but was responsive to the potentially sudden diurnal and\u000a      seasonal variations in waste characteristics. It overcomes the inability\u000a      of the previously used mechanistic models, founded on classical kinetic\u000a      equations, to adequately represent rapidly changing and complex organic\u000a      food wastes [R4].\u000a    The resulting model was based on dividing the load into three proportions\u000a      according to particle size analysis (filtration and settlement R1) as a\u000a      surrogate for the kinetic microbial growth rate constants [G2].\u000a      This basic model was then used to guide new research necessary to optimise\u000a      pre-treatments to reduce particle size in difficult waste streams such as\u000a      those containing large amounts of solids, for example intact yeast cell\u000a      walls (Shelton Smith PhD 2008).\u000a    Wheatley, with the financial support of Unilever [G3], led\u000a      research by John Shelton-Smith (2003-2008) and Helen Theaker (2008-2009)\u000a      to apply and improve the knowledge on the effectiveness of novel particle\u000a      disruption techniques (ultrasound, microwaves, pressure swing, cavitation\u000a      and electropulses) to wastes from brewing and yeast processing. The\u000a      researchers were able to use the phase-analysis method of characterising\u000a      waste from their earlier work to predict risk and yields of biogas from\u000a      the proposed anaerobic treatment.

This practical\u000a      approach uses an `active waveguide' installed in a slope. This novel\u000a      device comprises a steel tube surrounded by granular backfill in a\u000a      borehole passing through the shear surface, as shown in Figure 1. When\u000a      soil movement strains the active waveguide, AE generated by the backfill\u000a      is conducted by the tube to the surface, where it is detected and\u000a      processed by the sensor. Research has shown that active waveguides are\u000a      more sensitive than inclinometers, the standard approach.\u000a    \u000a    Figure 1: Slope ALARMS arrangement\u000a    \u000a    In laboratory studies, 2000-2005, Dixon and PhD student Matthew Spriggs\u000a      devised and then refined AE-processing techniques for characterising\u000a      relationships between active waveguide generated AE rates and slope\u000a      deformation rates. This was the first demonstration world-wide of AE\u000a      monitoring capable of warning of instability and quantifying slope\u000a      movement rates [R1]. In EPSRC- funded research [G1], 2005,\u000a      of a multi-sensor real-time AE monitoring system using active waveguides\u000a      at the BIONICS research embankment (built to represent British transport\u000a      embankments) a study demonstrated the technique is robust and not prone to\u000a      false alarms.\u000a    Recognising the potential for the system to be used in routine\u000a      monitoring, Dixon approached the British Geological Survey (BGS), which\u000a      has expertise in developing field instrumentation, and proposed a research\u000a      collaboration to produce the LU patented [C1] practical, unitary\u000a      low-cost Slope ALARMS sensor capable of being installed and used anywhere\u000a      in the world. With funding from EPSRC's Follow-on Fund [G2], 2009,\u000a      the partners designed and built sensors and trialled them on an active\u000a      natural landslide over the 2009-10 winter [R2]. For the first\u000a      time, the researchers were able to show clear correlations between signals\u000a      from the AE sensors and inclinometer measurements of slope displacements.\u000a      The research produced information on slope movements and demonstrated\u000a      sensitivity of their AE sensors to rapid changes in displacement rate &#8212; a\u000a      primary requirement for an early-warning system [R3].\u000a    With funding from LU's EPSRC Knowledge Transfer Account (KTA) [G3],\u000a      2010, Dixon had additional sensors produced to establish further trial\u000a      sites. Monitoring of a large rock slope with road tunnel in the Alps,\u000a      which is in danger of collapsing [R4], has been in progress since\u000a      2010 with Italy's National Research Council, and at a railway-cutting\u000a      landslide since 2011 with Network Rail and Geotechnical Observations Ltd.\u000a      In 2011, finance from EPSRC's Collaboration Fund [G4] enabled\u000a      re-engineering of the sensors with BGS to improve performance, and support\u000a      from CH2M and Scarborough Borough Council made it possible for sensors to\u000a      be employed in landslides at Flat Cliffs (2011) and Scarborough (2012)\u000a      where slope movements cause distress to critical infrastructure.

The Qingdao Bay\u000d\u000a      Bridge was the first bridge built in the cold and frozen seas in north\u000d\u000a      China [source (vi)]. The impact of ensuring the durability of\u000d\u000a      these concrete structures by early age testing using the Autoclam and\u000d\u000a      Permit on the economy of the Chinese construction industry can be better\u000d\u000a      understood if some of the national statistics are compared.\u000d\u000a    In the last two years expenditure in China on new construction and repair\u000d\u000a      and rehabilitation was RMB 16.7 billion and RMB 3.8 billion annually\u000d\u000a      respectively. These figures compare with RMB 6.7 billion and RMB 1.3\u000d\u000a      billion spent annually in 2005-08 on new construction and repair and\u000d\u000a      rehabilitation respectively. That is, there has been a steady increase in\u000d\u000a      construction budget, but large sums of money were spent on repair and\u000d\u000a      rehabilitation work. Therefore, by ensuring the durability of concrete\u000d\u000a      structures using early age testing, the proportion of money that will be\u000d\u000a      spent on repair is reduced in future years.

By mid-1980s it was\u000d\u000a      realised that concrete structures deteriorate due to the ingress of\u000d\u000a      aggressive elements from the service environment into the concrete,\u000d\u000a      primarily governed by its transport properties (viz. sorptivity,\u000d\u000a      diffusivity and permeability), and consequential physical and chemical\u000d\u000a      actions in concrete. Therefore, as highlighted in the Concrete Society\u000d\u000a      Technical Report 31, methods of measuring the transport properties of\u000d\u000a      concrete received global attention. It was also recognised that the choice\u000d\u000a      of test should reflect the predominant degradation mechanism acting on the\u000d\u000a      concrete structure. Therefore, for an offshore structure, an absorption\u000d\u000a      (sorptivity) type test would be suitable for studying the long-term\u000d\u000a      performance of concrete in the tidal zone, whereas a diffusion type and\/or\u000d\u000a      pressure differential water permeability type test would be more\u000d\u000a      appropriate for investigating the behaviour of concrete subjected to deep\u000d\u000a      submersion. By following this rationale, the Autoclam Permeability\u000d\u000a        System [grant (i); Basheer et al., 1995] and Permit Ion\u000d\u000a        Migration Test [grant (ii); Basheer et al., 2005] were developed so\u000d\u000a      as to obtain an index of the relevant transport properties in order to\u000d\u000a      assess the durability of concrete at different exposure conditions.\u000d\u000a    The protocols for carrying out the in situ air permeability test,\u000d\u000a      water permeability test and water absorption test on concrete and stone\u000d\u000a      masonry structures using the Autoclam Permeability System were developed\u000d\u000a      since 1993 by Basheer, Long and Montgomery (left QUB in\u000d\u000a      2003) [Basheer et al., 1994; 1995; Basheer and Nolan, 2001], supported by\u000d\u000a      an SERC grant [grant (i)].\u000d\u000a    The Permit Ion Migration test protocol [Basheer et al., 2005] for\u000d\u000a      measuring the resistance of concrete to chloride ion diffusion was\u000d\u000a      developed by Basheer, Robinson and Long, through\u000d\u000a      funding from EPSRC [grant (ii)].

Realising the benefit of an early\u000d\u000a      assessment of the durability of their concrete structures, a research\u000d\u000a      programme was initiated, supported by EPSRC [UK-China Bridge in\u000d\u000a      Sustainable Energy and Built Environment grant, grant (v)] to validate QUB\u000d\u000a      tests for Chinese constructions.

The\u000d\u000a      conventional technologies for arsenic remediation are based on `pump and\u000d\u000a      treat' method involving either adsorption or membrane processes. Such\u000d\u000a      plants are expensive to run and have problems associated with waste\u000d\u000a      disposal and maintenance. In contrast, Subterranean Arsenic Removal (SAR)\u000d\u000a      or `In-situ treatment' developed at Queen's University Belfast (QUB)\u000d\u000a      neither uses any chemicals, nor produces any waste, making it a very low\u000d\u000a      cost technology option for rural use.

The\u000d\u000a      underground aquifer is turned into a natural biochemical reactor and\u000d\u000a      adsorber, that removes soluble As along with Fe and Mn at an elevated\u000d\u000a      redox value of groundwater (Eh&gt; 300 mV in the oxidation zone), when\u000d\u000a      dissolved oxygen concentration in the groundwater is raised above 4 mg\/L.\u000d\u000a      The oxidation processes are accelerated by the autocatalytic effect of the\u000d\u000a      oxidation products and by the autotrophic micro organism. No sludge is\u000d\u000a      produced in the process, maintaining normal permeability of the aquifer.\u000d\u000a    In order to ensure real life application of the arsenic remediation\u000d\u000a      technology in the resource-poor areas, the following conditions were\u000d\u000a      considered:\u000d\u000a    (i) Marginalised rural communities may not be able to pay more than 1 US$\u000d\u000a      for a month's potable water supply\u000d\u000a    (ii) They may not be able to pay for regular maintenance, chemical\u000d\u000a      supplies, waste disposal and other recurring costs\u000d\u000a    (iii) The technology should ideally be waste-free.\u000d\u000a    All SAR plants are designed to produce safe drinking water (&lt;10 &#181;g\u000d\u000a      arsenic) without the use of any chemicals\/adsorbents\/membranes and waste\u000d\u000a      generation. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a    (i) All treatment plants can operate on electricity, solar or wind power,\u000d\u000a      which make them suitable for use in remote areas with no access to grid\u000d\u000a      power;\u000d\u000a    (ii) Plants have a very long life; submersible pumps can run for 25 years\u000d\u000a      with very little maintenance;\u000d\u000a    (iii) Every single component used in the plant is available from local\u000d\u000a      hardware shops.\u000d\u000a    The technology was developed by a consortium of Indian and European\u000d\u000a      Engineers led by Bhaskar Sen Gupta in 2004-06.

The company was\u000a      specifically formed to develop this technology and continues to do so\u000a      today. Owing to the track record of the Queen's team in conceiving device\u000a      concepts, undertaking the basic research and taking them to prototype\u000a      demonstration, as was demonstrated by the 75kW and LIMPET devices on the\u000a      Isle of Islay, private investors backed the new company initially with &#163;3\u000a      million and the Oyster project was born leading to the first prototype.\u000a      The company's website clearly states the role of the Queen's team and\u000a      Professor Whittaker in the birth of the company. The following is a direct\u000a      quote from the Aquamarine Power website &#8212;\u000a    \"Our story first started in 2001 when Professor Trevor Whittaker's\u000a        research and development team at Queen's University, Belfast began to\u000a        research flap-type wave power devices with a view to reducing the cost\u000a        of energy. The R&amp;D team's research ultimately led to the development\u000a        of the Oyster wave energy device. The innovative design of the Oyster\u000a        wave energy converter attracted the interest of Allan Thomson, the\u000a        retired founder of WaveGen, the UK's first ever wave power company.\u000a        Allan went on to co-fund further R&amp;D into the Oyster wave power\u000a        device. In 2005, Allan set up Aquamarine Power to bring Oyster wave\u000a        power technology to the commercial market.\u000a    \"In 2008 we completed our senior management team and our company\u000a        rapidly expanded as we went from four employees to a team of 15 in only\u000a        three months. We continue to grow rapidly. We now employ over 60 staff\u000a        who are all working towards our vision of making marine renewable energy\u000a        mainstream. SSE remains a major shareholder in Aquamarine Power. In\u000a        2010, we also secured major investment from ABB, one of the world's\u000a        largest power and automation companies.\"\u000a    To date the total funds raised from both private finance and public\u000a      grants are in excess of &#163;60 million. Two prototypes have been deployed at\u000a      sea. Oyster 1 was commissioned at the European Marine Test site on Orkney\u000a      in 2009 and Oyster 800 was commissioned spring 2013.\u000a    The research team at Queen's continues to support the development of\u000a      Oyster from hydrodynamic modelling in our two wave tanks, shown in sources\u000a          2 and 3, to numerical simulation of both the hydrodynamics and\u000a      projected electrical production. The third and fourth generations of the\u000a      Oyster machines are currently under development by Aquamarine with support\u000a      from the Queen's team. This complements the fundamental research being\u000a      conducted under grants 3, 4 and 5. In addition the team is supporting wave\u000a      and tidal power research throughout Europe through MARINET which is funded\u000a      by the European Union under framework 7 and enables trans-national access\u000a      to both our wave tank and tidal test facilities (source 4).\u000a    The success of the team in attracting grant income for fundamental\u000a      research in combination with the industrial exploitation of technology\u000a      developed at Queen's is testament to the standing of the group and the\u000a      impact it has had on the marine renewable energy industry.\u000a    European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) Ltd (www.emec.org.uk) is the world's\u000a      only accredited testing laboratory for the performance assessments of wave\u000a      and tidal facilities. Its endorsement (source 5) perhaps\u000a      best summarises the impact of this research by Queen's team:\u000a    ...Oyster is based on the original oscillating wave surge convertor\u000a        developed at Queens University by Professor Trevor Whittaker.\u000a    The wave energy industry is still in it infancy, however even at this\u000a        early stage the benefits generated from the development, installation,\u000a        commissioning and performance testing of the different machines are\u000a        apparent. Both EMEC and Orkney have benefited from these early stage\u000a        activities and expect to benefit still further as the industry develops...\u000a    In my opinion the fledgling industry and the associated economic\u000a        activity results directly from the long established, high quality\u000a        academic work undertaken at Queens University Belfast and other\u000a        universities over many years. In the case of Oyster I see this as a\u000a        direct result of the research undertaken by Professor Whittaker and his\u000a        team.\u000a    A further impact has been the expansion of the Queen's marine renewable\u000a      team and the inward investment in both academic staff and facilities. In\u000a      2009 Dr Elsaesser with extensive experience of numerical modelling coastal\u000a      processes was employed as a senior lecturer and in 2012 Dr O'Driscoll, an\u000a      oceanographer was employed as a lecturer. They have expanded the\u000a      capabilities of the group by interfacing numerical modelling with marine\u000a      biological science to quantify the impact of marine renewable structures\u000a      as well manmade pollutants in the seas and oceans.\u000a    In 2009 a &#163;1 million investment in facilities at Queen's was completed.\u000a      This included a 600 m2 building housing a 16m &#215; 18m coastal\u000a      wave basin with variable bathymetry, 24 computer controlled wave\u000a      generators and multi directional current generation. The investment also\u000a      financed equipment to measure waves and tidal currents at sea. This has\u000a      led to the development of a 1\/10th scale tidal stream test site\u000a      in Strangford narrows which is being used by device developers from across\u000a      Europe under the PF7 funded MARINET project. To date the tidal work has\u000a      generated &#163;1.1 million of research income. The international standing of\u000a      the group is demonstrated by the staff profile with researchers from USA,\u000a      New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Germany, France and Italy.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Wave power research at Queen's has led directly to the development of two\u000a      types of convertor by Aquamarine Power Ltd (Edinburgh) and Voith Hydro\u000a      Wavegen (Inverness).

The first major recognition of the quality of the work at\u000a      Queen's came in 1994 when Professors Whittaker FREng, Wells FRS, Long\u000a      FREng and Raghunathan were awarded the prestigious Royal Society ESSO\u000a      Energy prize for the pioneering work of their team which culminated in the\u000a      design, construction and operation of Britain's first grid connected wave\u000a      power plant, as described in reference 1. The 75kW unit,\u000a      located on the Isle of Islay, utilised the novel Wells turbine, was the\u000a      first grid connected wave machine in Britain and operated as a marine test\u000a      bed until it was decommissioned in 1999. This work led to the design and\u000a      construction of a second and much larger unit, LIMPET, on an adjacent\u000a      site.\u000a    LIMPET, described in reference 2, built on the continuing\u000a      research in the 1990's into the hydrodynamics of shallow water oscillating\u000a      water columns, the aerodynamic design of the Wells turbine and the\u000a      practical experience gained from operating the 75kW plant. With 2 million\u000a      pounds of funding divided evenly between a European grant under framework\u000a      3 and private equity from the shareholders of Wavegen Ltd, the 500kW plant\u000a      was commissioned in 2001. The plant continues to operate today as a marine\u000a      test bed for Wells turbine generator units and is owned and operated by\u000a      Voith Hydro Wavegen Ltd.\u000a    From 2001 the QUB team has concentrated its research on surging nearshore\u000a      wave energy convertors. In 2004 the final report of grant 1,\u000a      concluded that it was technically feasible to efficiently extract ocean\u000a      wave energy using seabed mounted bottom hinged flaps located in shallow\u000a      nearshore waters and the work was deemed to be internationally leading.\u000a    Today the 32 strong team at Queen's continues with fundamental research\u000a      in both wave and tidal stream energy supporting this embryonic industry\u000a      and maintaining its status as a World leader in this field. From grant\u000a          2, (Supergen Marine 2) and grant 3, (UKCMER), references\u000a          4 to 6 were generated and published in leading journals. One\u000a      of the most significant impacts, described in reference 3,\u000a      was the analysis of the nearshore wave energy resource leading to the\u000a      introduction of the concept of the exploitable wave resource and the\u000a      realisation that it is not significantly less than that offshore. Reference\u000a          4 has led to a significant body of work now funded by grant\u000a          3 researching spectral domain modelling of wave energy\u000a      converter arrays which should result in much more efficient numerical\u000a      models for predicting the energy output of wave farms. Reference 5\u000a      describes a novel way of controlling wave power converters to maximise\u000a      power output and has now been adopted by Aquamarine Power for their Oyster\u000a      wave power devices.

In the early 1990s, LU were confronted\u000a      with a major dilemma.\u000a    Having assessed over 1200 platforms on the underground system they found\u000a      that when flexural\u000a      methods of design were applied most platforms were found to be\u000a      structurally deficient. Thus a\u000a      major repair\/replacement programme appeared to be inevitable (LU estimated\u000a      replacement cost of\u000a      a typical platform was &#163;1.6 million). However, structural engineering\u000a      staff of LU had become\u000a      aware of our research through Journal papers (Ref 1) and of the potential\u000a      benefits of arching action\u000a      in cellular structures. By adopting our research findings, unique new\u000a      design guidelines for LU\u000a      platforms were drawn up in the late 1990's but it was only in 2005 that\u000a      these were approved for\u000a      use in the LU system. Taking into consideration the benefits of arching\u000a      action in their assessment\u000a      programme allowed 95% of their platforms to be retained and since 2008, LU\u000a      staff have estimated\u000a      that over &#163;80m has been saved (cost of structural repair\/replacement).\u000a      Here it should be noted\u000a      that by avoiding the repair\/replacement of the vast majority of their\u000a      platforms the enormous\u000a      disruption to the transport system in London has not occurred which would\u000a      have been an additional\u000a      drain on the UK economy as well as being socially unacceptable. Bearing in\u000a      mind that over 1\u000a      billion people use the LU system each year the cost (due to the loss of\u000a      productivity) of the\u000a      associated congestion has been acknowledged by LU staff to be `&#163;billions\u000a      not &#163;millions' (see\u000a      Section 5).\u000a    Thus LU would have had to accept the prospect of enormous disruption to\u000a      their system had their\u000a      staff not been able to take into account the benefits of AA.\u000a    Bridge Deck Slabs, UK and North America. Our research has impacted\u000a      on policy which allows\u000a      bridge designers\/assessors to take account of the benefits of AA, e.g.\u000a      less deck reinforcement, not\u000a      having to replace decks found to be unsatisfactory using flexural analysis\u000a      and indirect savings as\u000a      disruption\/congestion is minimal. Consequential savings are likely to be\u000a      of the order of tens of &#163;\u000a      millions over the past 5 years, however the overall benefits have not been\u000a      quantified by the UK\u000a      Highways Agency.\u000a    In N America the considerable benefits of corrosion free deck bridges has\u000a      been embraced in most\u000a      Canadian Provinces and in a number of northern states of USA arising from\u000a      the parallel research\u000a      by Mufti and his research team. Over 50, (mostly multi-span) bridges have\u000a      been constructed and\u000a      ISIS have estimated that long term savings of hundreds of $ millions\u000a      have\/will accrue through\u000a      minimal maintenance, dramatically reduced life cycle costs and losses to\u000a      the economy resulting\u000a      from disruption\/congestion associated with repair\/replacement. The system\u000a      is now being utilised\u000a      for highly prestigious projects such as the Winnipeg Floodway &#8212; a major $\u000a      700m project in\u000a      Manitoba where 6 multi-span bridges were built in 2009.\u000a    Since 1994 the QUB team and Mufti's researchers have derived mutual\u000a      benefit from their\u000a      overlapping AA research. In the USA and Canada AA research has impacted on\u000a      bridge\u000a      construction since the late 1990's and, as far as REF2014 is concerned,\u000a      through the past 5-6\u000a      years.\u000a    `FlexiArch'. As already highlighted in Section 2, conventional\u000a      arches are expensive to build and\u000a      take much longer to construct than beam and slab bridges made up of\u000a      prefabricated components.\u000a      To counter this, an innovative flexible concrete arch was devised and\u000a      patented in 2004. As this\u000a      does not require expensive centring the arch can be quickly constructed\u000a      (days rather than months\u000a      for a conventional arch) and by using precast concrete voussoirs it can be\u000a      manufactured at a\u000a      relatively low cost. All the basic features of a conventional arch are\u000a      retained and in 2005 Macrete\u000a      Ireland Ltd (Toomebridge) were licensed and since 2008 over 40 bridges\u000a      ranging in span from 4m\u000a      to 15m have been installed in UK\/Ireland. Its potential was anticipated in\u000a      2006 at an International\u000a      conference when Brian Bell, Network Rail, acknowledged that the FlexiArch\u000a      would allow highly\u000a      durable arches (seldom used since 1900) to compete with other rapid\u000a      methods of construction\u000a      (crucial for railways).\u000a    This innovative system has received 9 awards including the Best\u000a      Engineering Excellence Award of\u000a      RAEng (2009) and the UK National Construct Award for Innovation and its\u000a      adoption twice (in 2009\u000a      and again in 2013). Commercially the `FlexiArch' has had a very\u000a      significant impact in a severely\u000a      depressed market, and since 2008 an extra 50 person years of employment\u000a      have been generated\u000a      at Macrete. In addition, the `FlexiArch' system has been a key element in\u000a      winning the associated\u000a      construction contracts, valued at &#163;15m. A number of leading precast\u000a      contractors in Europe, N\u000a      America and Australasia have approached Macrete to acquire a sub-licence\u000a      for the FlexiArch in\u000a      their regions &#8212; these would greatly enhance the future use\/impact of the\u000a      FlexiArch.

Reinforced concrete slabs in structures have much\u000a      higher strengths than predicted\u000a      by flexural design methods which are widely used in practice. Depending on\u000a      the degree of lateral\u000a      restraint the strength enhancement due to AA can range from a few percent\u000a      to over three times the\u000a      predicted flexural strength.

The interaction between arching and flexural\u000a      action is very complex and required\u000a      much experimental work and parallel analytical studies to derive viable\u000a      prediction methods which\u000a      have provided solutions for flat slab structures, bridge deck slabs,\u000a      cellular offshore concrete\u000a      structures and composite floor slabs. Greatly improved prediction methods\u000a      have been developed\u000a      which have been simplified by our team for inclusion in (BD81\/02(2002))\u000a      for use by designers (so\u000a      that they could assess the strength of laterally restrained slabs in\u000a      practice). This has permitted a\u000a      70% reduction in the amount of reinforcement in bridge deck slabs. However\u000a      recognising that\u000a      most of the research had been published in highly technical journals Long\u000a      (Ref. 1) highlighted the\u000a      potential benefits to practitioners at a lecture in the Institution of\u000a      Civil Engineers in 1994,. A number\u000a      of innovative advances were highlighted by Long which led to an increase\u000a      in awareness in the UK\u000a      of the potential benefits of AA through the use of high strength\/fibre\u000a      reinforced concrete, centrally\u000a      located conventional steel reinforcement and corrosion free fibre\u000a      reinforced polymer (FRP) bars in\u000a      deck slabs. They also led to an upsurge in experimental and analytical\u000a      research in this area at\u000a      Queen's University (Ref. 2) which was backed up by full-scale testing on\u000a      site. Highly rated papers\u000a      in the Journal of the ICE were published in 1997 (Ref. 2) and 2001 (Ref.\u000a      3,4), (including two\u000a      Telford Premium Awards by ICE). A regular stream of PhDs have been awarded\u000a      at QUB and\u000a      numerous Journal papers published in this important area of research, eg\u000a      2007 paper in a US\u000a      Journal (Ref. 5).\u000a    In Canada researchers (Mufti et al) also identified the innovative\u000a      advances due to Arching Action\u000a      and focused on the development of corrosion-free deck slabs for\u000a      steel-concrete composite bridges\u000a      and demonstrated to industry in Canada that such systems were not only\u000a      viable but required\u000a      minimal maintenance. As in Canada the quest for maintenance-free bridges,\u000a      based on the\u000a      benefits of arching action, has been a central focus at Queen's. Thus\u000a      Mufti, then President of ISIS\u000a      Canada in Winnipeg, accepted the invitation to contribute part-time at QUB\u000a      because of his ongoing\u000a      involvement in AA research and his overlapping research interests with the\u000a      Belfast team.\u000a    Flexible Concrete Arch. In 1994 Professor Long recognised that\u000a      maintenance free bridges could\u000a      be based on the arch form of construction. Few arch bridges had been built\u000a      since the early 1900's\u000a      even though they are aesthetic, strong, durable and require little\u000a      maintenance. However, the\u000a      centring and preparation of the voussoirs by stone masons incurred cost\u000a      and time penalties which\u000a      made them non-competitive with RC, PC or steel alternatives. Subsequent\u000a      research at Queen's\u000a      could not be published until the innovative flexible concrete arch system\u000a      was patented (Long AE,\u000a      Int. Patent No W.O.2004\/044332A1). Macrete Ireland were licensed to\u000a      manufacture the `FlexiArch'\u000a      and since 2008 over 40 bridges have been installed in the UK\/Ireland.\u000a      Extensive research has\u000a      been carried out in parallel and this has included model tests in the\u000a      laboratory, full-scale testing at\u000a      Macrete, field testing and analytical research using a range of approaches\u000a      (Ref. 6).\u000a    Quality of Research. This has been recognised through 9\u000a      awards\/medals to members of the\u000a      team and contributed to Professor Long receiving the highly prestigious\u000a      Ewing Gold Medal of the\u000a      ICE\/Royal Society in 2009 and the Institution of Civil Engineers Gold\u000a      Medal (ICE's premier award)\u000a      in 2011.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38847","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of the above work is broadly in the provision of information\u000d\u000a      for design guides and codes of practice, specifically the Railway Group\u000d\u000a      Standards produced by the Railway Safety and Standards Board, the CEN\u000d\u000a      codes on Railway Aerodynamics and the Rolling Stock and Infrastructure\u000d\u000a      TSIs (Technical Standards for Interoperability, which have been developed\u000d\u000a      to allow railways to operate across national borders). The use of these\u000d\u000a      documents is mandatory in any new railway project \/ train design and thus\u000d\u000a      the influence of changes to these codes is felt across the sector. Changes\u000d\u000a      to the codes may not have direct economic benefits to the infrastructure\u000d\u000a      or train operators (indeed they may increase immediate costs), but the\u000d\u000a      impact will be felt in terms improved safety and reliability and, in the\u000d\u000a      case of the TSIs, in allowing international operations across borders. The\u000d\u000a      specific impacts of the ongoing work can be described under a number of\u000d\u000a      headings as follows.\u000d\u000a    Revisions to CEN code EN 14067-4 and Rolling\u000d\u000a          Stock TSI for the train slipstream measurement methodology (2012).\u000d\u000a      The work on train slipstreams in projects 1, 4 and (most importantly) 6,\u000d\u000a      and reported in references 1, 2 and 3, have been used to develop a revised\u000d\u000a      methodology for the testing of new trains to ensure that the slipstream\u000d\u000a      velocities measured caused by the trains do not exceed safety limits. The\u000d\u000a      most important concept to emerge from this work was the inherently\u000d\u000a      stochastic nature of train slipstream measurements and a full appreciation\u000d\u000a      of the need to properly treat the resulting sources of uncertainty in the\u000d\u000a      codes. After analysis of the data, it proved possible to greatly simplify\u000d\u000a      the existing methodology, that required tests to be carried out for\u000d\u000a      multiple train passes both at trackside and above a platform, such that\u000d\u000a      the platform based tests are no longer required. This simplification will\u000d\u000a      result in costs savings of the order of a hundred thousand euros in the\u000d\u000a      authorisation process for a new train. An example of this would be the\u000d\u000a      current work on the authorisation of the double unit Class 350 in the UK,\u000d\u000a      where the adoption of a simplified testing technique will substantially\u000d\u000a      speed up the certification process.\u000d\u000a    Provision of data for the development of a National Annex to the\u000d\u000a          CEN code for transient pressure forces due to train passing (2012).\u000d\u000a      The work of project 8, and reported in reference 4, in which the moving\u000d\u000a      model TRAIN rig was used to determine the transient train passing\u000d\u000a      aerodynamic pressure forces on a variety of structures, was used to\u000d\u000a      develop a UK National Annex for the Eurocode EN 1991-2, that related\u000d\u000a      specifically to UK track spacings rather than the continental track\u000d\u000a      spacings assumed in the main text of the code. Without the information\u000d\u000a      contained in the new National Annex the code is very conservative from a\u000d\u000a      UK perspective, and the new provisions allow for much more economical\u000d\u000a      design of trackside structures. For example, it will allow the design\u000d\u000a      loads due to passing trains on overbridges to be reduced by around 50% in\u000d\u000a      some cases, which, depending upon the design used and bridge span, may\u000d\u000a      result in savings of many tens of thousands of pounds in the construction\u000d\u000a      of any new bridge.\u000d\u000a    Development of wind tunnel testing methodology for trains in cross\u000d\u000a          winds for Railway Group Standard and CEN code (2009\/10). This\u000d\u000a      work was again based on the experience of Baker and the work carried out\u000d\u000a      in projects 2 and 5 and partially reported in reference 5. It resulted in\u000d\u000a      a methodology for wind tunnel testing that is included in the Railway\u000d\u000a      Group Code of Practice GM\/RT2542 (2009) and as an Appendix in the CEN code\u000d\u000a      EN 14067-6.

A number of\u000d\u000a      recent projects have been carried out that incorporates the applied and\u000d\u000a      fundamental knowledge obtained in all the projects listed above. The first\u000d\u000a      of these involved full scale measurements of the slipstream velocities\u000d\u000a      experienced on an overhead line installation vehicle as trains pass at\u000d\u000a      line speed (Network Rail) with a view to establishing safe working\u000d\u000a      practices. This will enable work to proceed on overhead line installation\u000d\u000a      in such a way that allows traffic on the adjacent line to continue to\u000d\u000a      operate. This uses the methodology developed in project 6 and reported in\u000d\u000a      reference 3. A Network Rail study indicates that the cost savings of such\u000d\u000a      an operation over the normal method of obtaining a complete possession\u000d\u000a      will be of the order of &#163;1.2m \/ year during construction, and this\u000d\u000a      methodology is being used in the Great Western Electrification process.\u000d\u000a      The second involves the use of the TRAIN rig measurements of train\u000d\u000a      slipstreams and pressure transients for the proposed high speed line north\u000d\u000a      of London (Arup and HS2), in order to allow track spacing to be\u000d\u000a      determined. This builds on the work of project 8 as reported in reference\u000d\u000a      4. Finally, work has recently been carried out on the TRAIN Rig for HS2,\u000d\u000a      to measure train slipstreams and pressure forces on passing trains. This\u000d\u000a      information is required to determine safe track worker clearances for the\u000d\u000a      very high speed running that is envisaged, in order to validate the\u000d\u000a      assumption of the proposed track spacing (which is on the critical path\u000d\u000a      for the design of HS2); to optimise aerodynamic forces on passing trains,\u000d\u000a      and to allow modelling to be carried out on the effect of the new line of\u000d\u000a      birds and flying invertebrates. This work is based upon the work of\u000d\u000a      projects 6 and 7 as reported in papers 3 and 4.\u000d\u000a    Provision of expert witness advice for a court case and an inquest\u000d\u000a          (2008 and 2012\/3). The work of project 3 and reported in\u000d\u000a      reference 4 has enabled advice to be given in a court case and an inquest.\u000d\u000a      The first of these (in 2008) involved a high-sided vehicle loaded with\u000d\u000a      lightweight building material (insulation) which was blown sideways such\u000d\u000a      that the wheels on one side lifted off the road. This caused an oncoming\u000d\u000a      vehicle to swerve and have an accident. Analysis suggested that the driver\u000d\u000a      of the lorry would not have been able to avoid the situation. The inquest\u000d\u000a      concerned the death of a pedestrian when a lorry blew over onto him,\u000d\u000a      allegedly due to high winds caused by the construction of a high rise\u000d\u000a      structure. The advice offered was again based on the outcome of project 3\u000d\u000a      and reference 4, and, whilst the verdict of the coroner is pending, the\u000d\u000a      advice offered may lead to significant revision of the methodologies and\u000d\u000a      criteria for assessing the effect of tall buildings on wind conditions\u000d\u000a      that affect both pedestrians and vehicles around the base of the building.\u000d\u000a    It can thus be seen that the fundamental research work outlined above\u000d\u000a      underpins and directly informs a number of practical applications. The\u000d\u000a      work has proved to be of significance to a wide reach of organisations &#8212;\u000d\u000a      specifically codification bodies, train designers and builders and train\u000d\u000a      infrastructure operators, as well as being of legal significance in some\u000d\u000a      court cases. The impact takes a number of forms but will have economic\u000d\u000a      impact (in terms of more efficient ways of train aerodynamic testing, or\u000d\u000a      of solving specific issues in a cost efficient way), impact on\u000d\u000a      practitioners and professional services (in terms of the specification of\u000d\u000a      new and revised codes of practice) and also impact on public safety (in\u000d\u000a      making the railway safer for passengers and trackside workers). The work\u000d\u000a      continues in project 8, which is examining the inherent conservatism in\u000d\u000a      railway aerodynamic codes of practice through the carrying out of full\u000d\u000a      scale aerodynamic measurements on the operating railway.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study describes the impact of the work at the University in the\u000d\u000a      field of rail and road vehicle aerodynamics, which has primarily been\u000d\u000a      through the integration of research into UK and EU standards and codes of\u000d\u000a      practice.

The difficulty of accurately locating\u000d\u000a      these buried pipes and cables means that there are far more excavations\u000d\u000a      taking place than should be necessary; an estimated one in four of all\u000d\u000a      holes are dug in the wrong place. This increases the direct costs of\u000d\u000a      maintenance to service providers and the social costs in terms of\u000d\u000a      disruption to the public and businesses. In 2006 the road user delay costs\u000d\u000a      alone due to streetworks were estimated as &#163;5.1 billion per year for the\u000d\u000a      UK (source 1), indicating the economic benefits that would be achieved by\u000d\u000a      a reduction in unnecessary works.\u000d\u000a    The MTU project has been a crucial catalyst for the industry, leading to\u000d\u000a      a clearer understanding within it about the step-changes needed to realise\u000d\u000a      these potential savings. Important elements of these requirements have now\u000d\u000a      been put into place as described below, with the Birmingham MTU\u000d\u000a      researchers making a distinct and material contribution to their\u000d\u000a      establishment and implementation.\u000d\u000a    The impact achieved to date has been primarily on practitioners and\u000d\u000a      professional services within the sector; these are the crucial building\u000d\u000a      blocks for realisation of economic impact in the future.\u000d\u000a\u0009Impact 1 - new professional training facility informed by research - MTU Centre\u000d\u000a          of Excellence: A new national test and training facility for\u000d\u000a      underground utility mapping, designed as part of MTU2, based on MTU1 and\u000d\u000a      MTU2 research, was opened in September 2012. The design developed by the\u000d\u000a      Birmingham team was adopted by a contractor (JK Guest), who invested\u000d\u000a      &#163;2million to build the site and associated training facilities in\u000d\u000a      Lancashire. The Centre is designed to upskill practitioners and educate\u000d\u000a      clients as well as to provide testing facilities for the MTU team and\u000d\u000a      other interested researchers. MTU2 assisted JK Guest with the development\u000d\u000a      of NVQ accredited skills modules, which were released in June 2012. The\u000d\u000a      number of people trained on the test site by the end of July 2013 was over\u000d\u000a      600, with the initial focus on civil engineering clients and contractors\u000d\u000a      (e.g. TfL and HAA). Hence, the greatest effect and benefit for the\u000d\u000a      construction industry as a whole has been to allow these companies to\u000d\u000a      measure the competence of the individuals and companies they employ to\u000d\u000a      carry out their surveys. (source 2) This initiative alone covers a variety\u000d\u000a      of the impact (awareness, behaviour, capacity, practice and\u000d\u000a        understanding)\u000d\u000a    Impact 2 - new professional standard informed by research - BSI\u000d\u000a          Publically Available Specification for underground utility detection,\u000d\u000a          verification and location, sponsored by the Institution of Civil\u000d\u000a          Engineers(ICE): MTU2, together with industry partners,\u000d\u000a      promoted the need for a national standard equivalent to those in the USA,\u000d\u000a      Canada and Australia to raise the profile of utility mapping in the UK and\u000d\u000a      ensure there is a common understanding within the industry about the\u000d\u000a      different levels of survey available. They were successful in making the\u000d\u000a      case for this and as a result in 2012 the British Standards Institution\u000d\u000a      agreed to create a new specification which was sponsored by the ICE. Dr\u000d\u000a      Metje from the University represents the MTU on the Steering Committee as\u000d\u000a      its only academic member, and has contributed, in particular, by\u000d\u000a      ensuring that the standard is future proof and includes the latest MTU\u000d\u000a      findings. The specification is expected to be published in January 2014.\u000d\u000a      This will make a real, measureable difference to the industry which was\u000d\u000a      highlighted by Nick Zembillas in Civil Engineering Surveyor (Nov.\u000d\u000a      2012) about national standards for utility detection stating that the\u000d\u000a      advantages are \"Firstly, engineers and surveyors work within a\u000d\u000a        guideline that meets a client's expectation and secondly, the client is\u000d\u000a        assured that we hold full responsibility for the utility surveys we\u000d\u000a        produce...and more importantly help eliminate risks associated with\u000d\u000a        underground utilities during construction.\" Thus, the research has\u000d\u000a      resulted in a change in policy and practice.\u000d\u000a    Impact 3 - professional bodies have used research to define best\u000d\u000a          practice - establishment of the Utility Mapping Association (UMA):\u000d\u000a      MTU1, MTU Network, MTU2, MTU PTI raised the profile of utility mapping at\u000d\u000a      industry events such as NoDig Live. It helped to stimulate a debate and\u000d\u000a      worked closely with JK Guest who set-up the UMA in Sept. 2011. The UMA\u000d\u000a      involves some of the biggest players such as Atkins plus representatives\u000d\u000a      from other large associations such as The Survey Association. This was\u000d\u000a      highlighted in a CIRIA briefing in Dec. 2012. The UMA is a significant\u000d\u000a      step forward as previously the industry was fragmented, and MTU had\u000d\u000a      identified the potential benefits of greater co-operation. MTU is\u000d\u000a      represented by Metje on the Steering Committee - a 3 year appointment to\u000d\u000a      ensure the latest thinking from around the world and MTU outcomes are\u000d\u000a      disseminated. The UMA seeks to \"Work with all stakeholders to inform and\u000d\u000a      assist in the establishment of a set of standards that reflect\u000d\u000a      good practice in utility detection and mapping to help promote\u000d\u000a      clear measurable accredited competence levels\".\u000d\u000a    Impact 4 - professional bodies have used research to define best\u000d\u000a          practice - invitations to join agenda-setting professional\u000d\u000a          organisations and groups: Through Metje (MTU2), UB is\u000d\u000a      represented on a number of influential, agenda setting groups such as the\u000d\u000a      `Buried Assets Centre of Knowledge' (since April 2012), the Balfour Beatty\u000d\u000a      Utility Solution's `Ground Breaking - Breaking Ground' initiative (since\u000d\u000a      Dec. 2011) and the ICE Municipal Engineering Panel (since Sept. 2012) as\u000d\u000a      well as the US Transportation Research Board Utilities Committee (since\u000d\u000a      April 2011). The invitation to join these groups demonstrates the great\u000d\u000a      value the industry in the UK and USA has placed on the MTU research and\u000d\u000a      the willingness to embrace the findings of the research in the near\u000d\u000a      future.\u000d\u000a    Impact 5 - Public policy and public engagement: MTU2 and\u000d\u000a      MTU PTI have explained the challenges associated with buried\u000d\u000a      infrastructure and how they can be addressed to politicians, councillors\u000d\u000a      and civil servants. Non-traditional methods have been used to ensure wide\u000d\u000a      coverage. For example, an animated video was developed (July 2011 -\u000d\u000a      available on YouTube) explaining the research and a specific workshop\u000d\u000a      aimed at politicians and civil servants was held (March 2011). The MP for\u000d\u000a      Solihull, Lorely Burt, stated that \"...what we all take for granted is\u000d\u000a        the service that's delivered to our homes and businesses underground and\u000d\u000a        I don't think you see much resistance to this type of project and it is\u000d\u000a        absolutely vital\" and the Councillor Andrew Carter stating that \"...\u000a        the end product of that [MTU project] hopefully will be some new\u000d\u000a        technology which all the utility companies and indeed local authorities\u000d\u000a        can use to their mutual advantage... and I was absolutely fascinated by\u000d\u000a        the details of the project that UB is leading and it could lead to\u000d\u000a        something extremely valuable.\" The project also attracted the\u000d\u000a      attention of BBC Radio 4 which broadcast a 30 minute programme focused on\u000d\u000a      the project, Mapping Britain's Underworld, in May 2012 helping to\u000d\u000a      raise public awareness of the issues. Robert Burns from Balfour Beatty\u000d\u000a      Utility Solutions said on this programme that the \"MTU project is\u000d\u000a        important to us because what it actually starts to do is to bring a lot\u000d\u000a        of these [locating] technologies into one platform. It's a very complex\u000d\u000a        situation and people are always looking for this silver bullet\".\u000d\u000a    Impact 6 - International reach of MTU: MTU2 (UB, Civil\u000d\u000a      Engineering) has established three MSc level training modules (equivalent\u000d\u000a      to 60 credits in total) for the Malaysian Association of Land Surveyors in\u000d\u000a      order to train the next generation of utility surveyors. This training was\u000d\u000a      delivered in the autumn 2011 (45 participants) and 2012 (25 participants)\u000d\u000a      in Malaysia. This link was established as a direct result of the\u000d\u000a      international outreach and dissemination of the team at Birmingham.\u000d\u000a      Additionally, MTU2 provided CPD training to groups of approximately 30\u000d\u000a      Malaysian surveyors both at UB and at the national test facility for 2-3\u000d\u000a      days in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Furthermore, the Principal Assistant\u000d\u000a      Director of Survey (Utility Mapping Section) at the Department of Survey\u000d\u000a      and Mapping Malaysia (JUPEM) was sent to UB to read for a research degree\u000d\u000a      funded by the Malaysian government. The above is evidence of the worldwide\u000d\u000a      impact and reputation of MTU. Based on the developments and experience\u000d\u000a      with the national MTU tests site, some form of collaboration for a new\u000d\u000a      Malaysian test site is currently been explored.\u000d\u000a    Impact 7 - Development of the Smart Pipes initiative: MTU\u000d\u000a      focuses on the location of buried assets, but it promoted in its 25 year\u000d\u000a      vision the condition assessment of the pipes for proactive asset\u000d\u000a      management to become reality. This challenge was taken up by the Smart\u000d\u000a      Pipes initiative which is now in its implementation phase as a result of a\u000d\u000a      TSB award in July 2013. The aim is to instrument pipes with small\u000d\u000a      (millimetre size) off-the-shelf pressure and accelerometer sensors at a\u000d\u000a      high temporal and spatial resolution to identify the formation of leaks\u000d\u000a      and their location at an early stage, thereby saving the UK over 100Ml\/d\u000d\u000a      (or approx. &#163;5000\/d in water alone), with significant international\u000d\u000a      applications. The TSB grant is worth &#163;645k with &#163;265k direct input from\u000d\u000a      industry (2 water companies, 2 contractors). The key is to ensure\u000d\u000a      continuous power and in-turn power efficient communication nodes. This has\u000d\u000a      been the focus of research with the development of an isotopic battery\u000d\u000a      capable of generation 0.8 03bcW and a communication node currently\u000d\u000a      requiring ~7 03bcW.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Many utility services are distributed using buried infrastructure beneath\u000d\u000a      roads; inaccurate location leads to wasteful excavations and additional\u000d\u000a      costs for service providers, businesses and the public. The Mapping the\u000d\u000a      Underworld (MTU) project developed a proof-of-concept device to locate\u000d\u000a      buried assets which can overcome problems of inaccurate mapping. This\u000d\u000a      programme has acted as a crucial catalyst for the sector, leading to a\u000d\u000a      series of significant actions by the industry informed by the MTU project.\u000d\u000a      For instance, JK Guest, a major private sector contractor, invested &#163;2m to\u000d\u000a      establish the first vocational training centre for underground utility\u000d\u000a      mapping in the UK to a specification developed by the Birmingham\u000d\u000a      researchers; this centre opened in 2012 and more than 600 people had been\u000d\u000a      trained there by July 2013. MTU and the industry promoted the development\u000d\u000a      of an industry-standard for underground utility surveying, leading to the\u000d\u000a      agreement of the British Standards Institute to develop a new standard\u000d\u000a      which is being developed with sponsorship by the Institute of Civil\u000d\u000a      Engineers. These, and the other impacts described in the case study,\u000d\u000a      demonstrate the impact made to date on practitioners and professionals in\u000d\u000a      the sector; these are the building blocks for the realisation of extensive\u000d\u000a      economic impact from reduced disruption and the pro-active condition\u000d\u000a      management of buried utilities.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Birmingham\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

One area identified was\u000d\u000a      the need to accurately locate and map existing buried infrastructure in\u000d\u000a      order to improve the reliability of trenchless construction. This\u000d\u000a      culminated in a workshop held at the UB on Underground Mapping Pipeline\u000d\u000a      Location and Condition Assessment in 2001 attracting approximately 30\u000d\u000a      industrial stakeholders preparing the ground for MTU.

This project\u000d\u000a      consisted of 8 work packages (WP), two of which were led by UB. One WP\u000d\u000a      focussed on the development of a Knowledge Based System (KBS) taking\u000d\u000a      geotechnical and hydrological parameters to determine geophysical soil\u000d\u000a      parameters and thereby soil suitability information to indicate the\u000d\u000a      suitability of different sensing technologies and it identified that\u000d\u000a      information from borehole records can be used to predict these geophysical\u000d\u000a      soil properties. The second WP compiled specifications for a UK national\u000d\u000a      test facility. The specification of the test site sparked interest by JK\u000d\u000a      Guest, so that the site was built and opened 2012 (see Impact 1).\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the UB continued the network engagement and developed\u000d\u000a      opportunities to engage with different stakeholders such as politicians\u000d\u000a      and civil servants through the MTU Pathways to Impact (PTI) project (Jan.\u000a        2011-June 2011), the presentation of the project to different\u000d\u000a      audiences and the participation in a number of different professional\u000d\u000a      initiatives. Additional projects focus on the development of a fifth\u000d\u000a      sensor technology using gravity gradient inferometers (GG-TOP, EP\/I036877\/1\u000d\u000a      Oct. 2011- Sept. 2015) with UB Civil Engineering leading the WP on\u000d\u000a      determining the practical limitations of this technology as well as\u000d\u000a      providing practical applications using the MTU test site and the\u000d\u000a      comparison with the MTU sensing technologies.\u000d\u000a    Not only is the location of the buried infrastructure critical, but\u000d\u000a      determining the condition of the asset is also vital for the asset owners.\u000d\u000a      Therefore, Smart Pipes (UKWIR, AWWarF and TSB, EP\/K504191\/1, ~&#163;380k,\u000a        2006-2016), is a parallel project to MTU developing micro- or\u000d\u000a      nano-scale sensors to attach to plastic water distribution pipe walls to\u000d\u000a      detect pipe material deterioration and leaks and remotely relay this\u000d\u000a      information to a central server. This work extends the MTU concept as it\u000d\u000a      provides condition information, but for this to be truly successful the\u000d\u000a      location of the pipes has to be known in the first place, which is the aim\u000d\u000a      of MTU.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38849","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Birmingham research led to the development of HDM-4 which is a widely\u000d\u000a      used tool for road\u000d\u000a      investment appraisal and decision-making, generating improvements in\u000d\u000a      public policies and\u000d\u000a      services.

For example,\u000d\u000a      the World Bank used\u000d\u000a      HDM-4 to assess the &#8364; 306 million Northern Corridor Transport Improvement\u000d\u000a      Project (225 km\u000d\u000a      sections of Mombasa &#8212; Malaba\/Kisumu roads in Kenya; and the road\u000d\u000a      feasibility and design studies\u000d\u000a      for the rehabilitation of the Lodwar- Nadapal 248 km highway in Kenya\u000d\u000a      where the World Bank\u000d\u000a      provided a $ 4.0 million loan to meet the cost of the feasibility and\u000d\u000a      design studies for strengthening\u000d\u000a      and upgrading of the road link (source 1).\u000d\u000a    HDM-4 has also been used by lead organisations in developing countries to\u000d\u000a      justify proposals they\u000d\u000a      make to attract investment from international donors. For instance, in\u000d\u000a      2009 HDM-4 was used to\u000d\u000a      determine the costs and benefits of the long-term maintenance of the\u000d\u000a      African North-South Corridor\u000d\u000a      Aid-for-Trade road network, an important 8,600km road network connecting\u000d\u000a      Dar-es-Salaam in\u000d\u000a      Tanzania to the copper-belt of Zambia and the ports in southern Africa.\u000d\u000a      The resulting analysis, and\u000d\u000a      further assessment through HDM-4, was used to prioritise road upgrading\u000d\u000a      projects on the network\u000d\u000a      and also to determine the financial and economic rates of return on\u000d\u000a      projects in the wide context of\u000d\u000a      the Corridor as a whole. This latter aspect formed part of the case put\u000d\u000a      forward by TradeMark\u000d\u000a      Southern Africa (the regional economic body) to win over $600m investment\u000d\u000a      in the Corridor from\u000d\u000a      international donors by June 2013 (sources 2 and 3).\u000d\u000a    Governments throughout the developing world use HDM-4 routinely for road\u000d\u000a      investment appraisal.\u000d\u000a      For example, in Uganda, it has been used since 2010 to review the design,\u000d\u000a      cost and economic\u000d\u000a      benefit of upgrading 836 km of roads to bituminous standard (source 4). In\u000d\u000a      Bangladesh, the Roads\u000d\u000a      and Highways Department have used HDM (III, then 4) for the last 14 years\u000d\u000a      to assess annually the\u000d\u000a      maintenance needs of its highways and district roads and to prioritize\u000d\u000a      maintenance expenditure so\u000d\u000a      that the most economically beneficial roads are given the highest\u000d\u000a      priority. (source 5)\u000d\u000a    Since 2008 more than 350 senior executives from over 30 countries have\u000d\u000a      been educated through\u000d\u000a      the World Bank-conceived and approved mechanism for the dissemination of\u000d\u000a      road sector research,\u000d\u000a      known as the Senior Road Executives Programme held in Birmingham. The\u000d\u000a      programme\u000d\u000a      curriculum includes the fundamental concepts associated with HDM-4. The\u000d\u000a      executives are\u000d\u000a      primarily from developing countries and are in decision making positions;\u000d\u000a      their education in the\u000d\u000a      HDM-4 methodology will have added to their contribution to their\u000d\u000a      countries' economic development\u000d\u000a      (source 6).\u000d\u000a    Commercial impact through HDMGlobal\u000d\u000a      Following the initial success of the HDM initiative, HDMGlobal was\u000d\u000a      established in 2005 as a new\u000d\u000a      consortium to commercialise HDM-4; its commercial success is a further\u000d\u000a      result of the Birmingham\u000d\u000a      research. HDMGlobal is based at the University of Birmingham Research\u000d\u000a      Park, and is a\u000d\u000a      consortium of the University, Atkins and URS-Wilson with other partners\u000d\u000a      from the UK, Australia,\u000d\u000a      France and Chile. The consortium was initially given a five-year\u000d\u000a      concession by the World Road\u000d\u000a      Association-PIARC for the exclusive right to distribute HDM-4 from June\u000d\u000a      2005; following the\u000d\u000a      success of HDM-4 Version, PIARC extended this for a further five years in\u000d\u000a      2010.\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, HDMGlobal sold more than 1440 licences for HDM-4: 600 to\u000d\u000a      countries with special\u000d\u000a      economic needs; 450 to other countries; 110 to academic institutions; over\u000d\u000a      180 educational\u000d\u000a      licences to commercial training institutions; and 100 other licences. This\u000d\u000a      has generated an income\u000d\u000a      of &#163;1.6m for the consortium, of which over &#163;0.4m has been paid to the\u000d\u000a      World Road Association-PIARC\u000d\u000a      in royalties. (sources 7 and 8) The organisations which make up the\u000d\u000a      consortium are\u000d\u000a      regularly commissioned to undertake assessments using HDM-4 and provide\u000d\u000a      training.\u000d\u000a    Exploitation of HDM-4 in the UK\u000d\u000a      HDM-4 has also been used to feed into assessments of the value for money\u000d\u000a      achieved from road\u000d\u000a      investment in the UK. The Department for Transport (DfT) commissioned an\u000d\u000a      assessment\u000d\u000a      completed in 2009 using HDM-4 to analyse the English local road network to\u000d\u000a      quantify their long-term\u000d\u000a      maintenance needs and assess the effects of different maintenance funding\u000d\u000a      levels on the\u000d\u000a      condition of the network and costs to road users. HDM-4 was adapted and\u000d\u000a      calibrated to provide\u000d\u000a      accurate results for England and linked with the DfT's database to\u000d\u000a      facilitate strategic analysis.\u000d\u000a      (source 9)\u000d\u000a    HDMGlobal have also utilised the research on the strategic planning\u000d\u000a      maintenance framework to\u000d\u000a      work with the DfT on the current Highways Management Efficiency Programme\u000d\u000a      (www.dft.gov.uk\/hmep). The outputs from this include freely available\u000d\u000a      software to demonstrate the\u000d\u000a      impact of investment in maintenance on road condition, which could\u000d\u000a      facilitate shifts in public\u000d\u000a      budgets in favour of road maintenance.\u000d\u000a    Work to develop equipment to collect accurate data for input into HDM-4\u000d\u000a      at low cost has ultimately\u000d\u000a      led to the accreditation in 2013 by the UK Transport Research Laboratory\u000d\u000a      of a new Chinese-developed\u000d\u000a      data collection vehicle. The Birmingham researchers have continued the\u000d\u000a      development\u000d\u000a      of the SPM component systems which combine the HDM-4 analyses with\u000d\u000a      observed road\u000d\u000a      conditions to enable the use of HDM-4 in road asset management to be fully\u000d\u000a      exploited by a road\u000d\u000a      agency. Working with Highway Management Services Ltd and Key Traffic\u000d\u000a      Systems (a major\u000d\u000a      developer of highway software to UK local authorities), the component\u000d\u000a      management systems have\u000d\u000a      been redeveloped; this allows data collected by TRL-accredited vehicles,\u000d\u000a      such as the one noted\u000d\u000a      above, to be seamlessly imported into the systems and easily used for\u000d\u000a      HDM-4 analysis and these\u000d\u000a      systems are now being used to manage the road maintenance of two London\u000d\u000a      Boroughs.

Two major research projects\u000d\u000a      investigated: i) a\u000d\u000a      statistical approach to overcome data quality issues, involving\u000d\u000a      collaboration between the HDM-4\u000d\u000a      team and statisticians at Birmingham, which led to novel methods of\u000d\u000a      determining defect models\u000d\u000a      which could be employed in HDM-4 (1990 - 1996: EPSRC Grant Number\u000d\u000a      GR\/J43479); ii) means\u000d\u000a      of enhancing the quality of road data which devised new techniques for\u000d\u000a      objective measurement of\u000d\u000a      which the most sophisticated was the prototyping of high speed parallel\u000d\u000a      processing of digital\u000d\u000a      images of the roads surface, the products of which are used throughout the\u000d\u000a      world (1993 - 1998:\u000d\u000a      EPSRC GR\/H 80743, DFID ENAG294\/832\/837\/001A).\u000d\u000a    Incorporating HDM-4 within a strategic planning maintenance\u000d\u000a          framework (SPM)\u000d\u000a      Using economic models, such as HDM-4, effectively within road asset\u000d\u000a      management also requires\u000d\u000a      other techniques to combine the HDM-4 analyses with observed road\u000d\u000a      conditions. Extensive\u000d\u000a      research was undertaken at Birmingham on a template and its associated\u000d\u000a      components for the\u000d\u000a      operation devised for the task, known as SPM, and the use of Multiple\u000d\u000a      Criteria Analysis to modify\u000d\u000a      the HDM-4 economically derived standards to suit the socio-political\u000d\u000a      demands of the road user\u000d\u000a      (references 4 and 5). Initial work on this aspect was funded by an EPSRC\u000d\u000a      \"Link\" project (1998-2000:\u000d\u000a      GR\/L99814) and was subsequently implemented for the first time in\u000d\u000a      Malaysia.\u000d\u000a      It was also identified that for an assessment of network condition a\u000d\u000a      further model was required in\u000d\u000a      parallel with HDM-4 and to that end NETCOM was the first stochastic\u000d\u000a      modelling approach that was\u000d\u000a      developed (1993 - 1995: DEFRA R185\/93) and was succeeded by STRAT-2\u000d\u000a      (2000-2001: EPSRC\u000d\u000a      \"Link\" GR\/N37384) to give network behaviour in a powerful way for the use\u000d\u000a      of decision makers.\u000d\u000a    Using HDM-4 as a research tool\u000d\u000a      HDM-4 has been used as a research tool in since 2007 at Birmingham\u000d\u000a      including investigating the\u000d\u000a      potential impact of climate change on road deterioration and maintenance\u000d\u000a      requirements,\u000d\u000a      addressing maintenance backlog, the deleterious effects of corruption in\u000d\u000a      the road sector; and\u000d\u000a      economic basis for the design of pavements on tropical soils (reference\u000d\u000a      6).\u000d\u000a    Fundamental PhD research continues at Birmingham with a focus primarily\u000d\u000a      on enhancing road\u000d\u000a      deterioration models. Additional research at Birmingham was carried out to\u000d\u000a      see how HDM-4 could\u000d\u000a      be incorporated within a strategic maintenance planning framework and also\u000d\u000a      how HDM-4 could be\u000d\u000a      implemented in any particular country or region\u000d\u000a    The lead researchers in this body of work have been: Professor Martin\u000d\u000a      Snaith (Chair of Highway\u000d\u000a      Engineering, until 2002); Professor Henry Kerali (Professor of Highway\u000d\u000a      Engineering and\u000d\u000a      Management, until 2006); Dr Jennaro Odoki (Senior Lecturer 2002-2010); Dr\u000d\u000a      Harry Evdorides (RF,\u000d\u000a      then Lecturer, from 1994 to present date); and Dr Michael Burrow (RF, then\u000d\u000a      Lecturer, from 1998 to\u000d\u000a      present date).\u000d\u000a    All of the relevant research for HDM-4 was led by academics at\u000d\u000a      Birmingham.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42175","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1820814","Name":"Brunei"},{"GeoNamesId":"3351879","Name":"Angola"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research outlined in section 2 led to Jardine's invitation onto the\u000d\u000a      principal International Industry (API, ISO, SUT and ISSMGE) Committees and\u000d\u000a      engagement in multiple major practical projects. Critical to the reach and\u000d\u000a      depth of impact was the production of a widely read and used design book\u000d\u000a      [H], developed through engagement with Industrial partners (Amoco, BP,\u000d\u000a      HSE, Shell) and Consultants and published through the ICE's publishers,\u000d\u000a      Thomas Telford. Additional web-based practical guidance was produced with\u000d\u000a      HSE, who endorsed and funded the work. Other steps included the\u000d\u000a      organisation of CPD courses and keynotes delivered to over 1000 engineers\u000d\u000a      in 14 countries. Examples of effective knowledge transfer include work\u000d\u000a      with, among others, Atkins, BP, Fugro, GCG, Noble Denton, Shell, as noted\u000d\u000a      in our supporting evidence. Also critical was direct engagement in\u000d\u000a      practice, as outlined under A to D below. Taken together, these steps led\u000d\u000a      to ICP's adoption in Industry Standard American Petroleum Industry\u000d\u000a      (API-2011) and ISO design guidance, leading to beneficial impacts on a\u000d\u000a      regular basis. It has been used by Shell as their main design method for\u000d\u000a      all new platforms since 1996 [B].\u000d\u000a    4.1 BP and Premier Oil\u000d\u000a      The `ICP' research was critical to BP's development of the large,\u000d\u000a      exceptionally difficult, Atlantic Frontier Clair field [A and E]. Applying\u000d\u000a      (over 2010-13) ICP to the new Clair Ridge structures (&#163;4.5bn value)\u000d\u000a      allowed driving failure risks to be reduced with low L\/D piles that were\u000d\u000a      shown to be satisfactory after accounting for negative cyclic loading and\u000d\u000a      pile group effects (which are ignored routinely). The foundation costs\u000d\u000a      (around &#163;100m) were reduced greatly and the piles installed without\u000d\u000a      difficulty in June 2013 [A]. ICP was also applied with Senergy (over\u000d\u000a      2012-2013) to Premier Oil's nearby dual-structure SOLAN development [E].\u000d\u000a    Similar benefits are being realised offshore Angola, where BP's deepwater\u000d\u000a      projects each cost around &#163;10bn. While piles can be driven at 2km depths\u000d\u000a      to anchor large floating facilities, the `unusual' Angolan sediments fall\u000d\u000a      outside prior piling experience. Applications of the more fundamental ICP\u000d\u000a      (2011-2012) linked to field trials allowed piles to be used more\u000d\u000a      confidently. Foundations cost around &#163;70m per installation; ICP\u000d\u000a      optimisation offers scope for savings in tens of &#163;m each and, more\u000d\u000a      importantly, a wider range of secure development options [A]\u000d\u000a    4.2 Shell\u000d\u000a      Shell have applied ICP to all their North Sea projects over the survey\u000d\u000a      period and in other regions including Brunei and Doha [B]. In another\u000d\u000a      example, Shell authors describe in [H] how the ICP allowed adventurous\u000d\u000a      platform designs at Skiff and later Brigantine that enabled marginal\u000d\u000a      fields to be developed, achieving 30 to 50% construction cost savings [F].\u000d\u000a      Peak production from these micro-platforms' ran at over &#163;100m\/year (based\u000d\u000a      on 15.108 m3\/year and $120 per 1000m3 five-year\u000a      price); their production revenues remained at tens of &#163;m\/yr over the\u000d\u000a      2008-2013 review period.\u000d\u000a    4.3 Renewable Energy\u000d\u000a      ICP also delivers benefits for tripod or jacket-based offshore\u000d\u000a      wind-turbines. The method was used in the biggest offshore development in\u000d\u000a      Germany; Borkum-West-II in 2010\/11. This project has a 1bn Euro\u000d\u000a      construction cost where foundations comprise 30% of costs; 120 large piles\u000d\u000a      were driven in hard conditions without failure [H]. The ICP design\u000d\u000a      procedures took into account potentially negative storm loading,\u000d\u000a      horizontal and axial cyclic interactions, system reliability and potential\u000d\u000a      driving problems. The Technical Director of Offshore Wind Consultants\u000d\u000a      (OWC) has made a detailed assessment of the material and installation cost\u000d\u000a      savings made, which amounted to 18 million euros [C]. Employing the ICP\u000d\u000a      probably avoided far larger installation problem costs; ICP is now being\u000d\u000a      applied in new German projects, including the Gode Wind development by\u000d\u000a      Danish Oil &amp; Natural Gas (DONG) [E]. UK projects are also benefitting.\u000d\u000a      Atkins are applying ICP in the Beatrice, Rampion and Galloper projects\u000d\u000a      where more than 1600 large offshore piles will be driven with anticipated\u000d\u000a      material and installation costs around &#163;500m. Preliminary analyses by\u000d\u000a      Atkins indicate that ICP will save up to &#163;100m and substantially reduce\u000d\u000a      both project risks and pile driving impact on marine mammals [D]. Similar\u000d\u000a      benefits may be taken in many other developments, including the major East\u000d\u000a      Anglia Offshore Wind (EAOW) project where the ICP is being applied by\u000d\u000a      Geotechnical Consulting Group (GCG) and Offshore Wind Consultants (OWC)\u000d\u000a      [C].\u000d\u000a    4.4 Sustainability and other new-build hydrocarbon projects\u000d\u000a      Extending existing UK energy supplies is vital. `ICP-based' investigations\u000d\u000a      and re-analyses have shown that foundation capacities may be higher in\u000d\u000a      some cases than anticipated, and so allow platforms to carry additional\u000d\u000a      plant or new wells. Research into installation techniques, cyclic loading,\u000d\u000a      group-action and well-drilling effects have been crucial. North Sea\u000d\u000a      platforms analysed in conjunction with Atkins and GCG include:\u000d\u000a      Indefatigable 49\/23AC (2009-2010), Auk (2010-2011), Montrose and Claymore\u000d\u000a      (2013) [D]. Dr Rob May, the Head of Energy Geotechnics at Atkins states\u000d\u000a      that \"The ICP based methodology has provided robust and reliable\u000d\u000a      assessments of foundation capacities and has, in many cases, enabled\u000d\u000a      enhanced capacities to be demonstrated. The benefits to the producers and\u000d\u000a      UK economy ...is to.. extend production at these ageing facilities\u000d\u000a      while avoiding expensive (tens to hundreds of millions of pounds) platform\u000d\u000a      replacements or early decommissioning of assets\" [D]. The value of such\u000d\u000a      developments was confirmed by BP's CEO Bob Dudley who is quoted on the\u000d\u000a      company's website as saying that the redevelopment of BP's Valhall field,\u000d\u000a      which involved applying the ICP to some of BP's existing structures [see A\u000d\u000a      and E] \"is one of BP's most complex field expansion developments and gives\u000d\u000a      Valhall a further 40-year design life with the capacity to handle 120,000\u000d\u000a      barrels of oil and 143 million cubic feet of gas per day\", with daily\u000d\u000a      production values easily exceeding &#163;10m.\u000d\u000a    The ICP has also been applied to assist a wide range of other new-build\u000d\u000a      oil and gas projects, including EdF's major new Cygnus multi-structure\u000d\u000a      North Sea gas project, providing major savings for several new platforms\u000d\u000a      [E].\u000d\u000a    4.5 Financial assessment of impacts\u000d\u000a      While accurate assessment is difficult, we have evidence [A-D] of\u000d\u000a      substantial benefits to 20 projects that involved direct ICP input through\u000d\u000a      Jardine since 2008 (Clair, Clair Ridge, Solan, Angola, Ormen Lange, Skiff,\u000d\u000a      Brigantine, Borkum-West, Beatrice, Rampion, Galloper, Indefatigable, Auk,\u000d\u000a      Claymore, Montrose, EAOW, Gode Wind, Cygnus, Valhall) The ICP is being\u000d\u000a      used independently by other designers and Lloyds Register confirms its use\u000d\u000a      in an additional 20 cases since 2008. Several other Independent\u000d\u000a      Verification Bodies operate internationally and some producers\u000d\u000a      self-certify, so the worldwide total is certainly higher. The ICP research\u000d\u000a      has also led other groups to modernise their procedures leading to\u000d\u000a      beneficial impacts from the research even in cases where the ICP is not\u000d\u000a      adopted as the formal design method.\u000d\u000a    Detailed data provided by OWC, Atkins and Senergy [C] to [E] attest to\u000d\u000a      savings of &#163;18m to &#163;100m in individual projects.

Research into such foundations has been\u000d\u000a      led by Prof Jardine at the Department of Civil and Environmental\u000d\u000a      Engineering of Imperial College London since the early 1990s. We highlight\u000d\u000a      specific research findings since 1993 that have had a substantial impact\u000d\u000a      on engineering practice.\u000d\u000a    (A) Research co-funded by EPSRC [7] and Industry running up to 1997\u000d\u000a      investigated the fundamental effective-stress behaviour of displacement\u000d\u000a      piles. Extensive field experiments at four UK clay and two French sand\u000d\u000a      sites with novel highly instrumented piles, supported by\u000d\u000a      laboratory\/theoretical studies, identified the key mechanisms that control\u000d\u000a      the stress system set up by pile driving and the parameters that control\u000d\u000a      both shaft and base stiffness and ultimate resistance, which differ\u000d\u000a      radically from those assumed conventionally. The research underpinned an\u000d\u000a      improved ability to understand, allow for and exploit in design the\u000d\u000a      influence of factors such pile slenderness, tip conditions, varying\u000d\u000a      responses in different clay types and the crucial importance of sand state\u000d\u000a      as revealed by local CPT tests. Three PhDs that all won Imperial College\u000d\u000a      Prizes were completed under the supervision of Prof Jardine and new\u000d\u000a      paradigms established to capture the principal physical features in\u000d\u000a      completely new design procedures [1,2,3,4,5]\u000d\u000a    (B) New simplified design rules that captured the key physical principles\u000d\u000a      were developed and tested against a verification database of over 130\u000d\u000a      industrial pile tests assembled by the Imperial College team. The study\u000d\u000a      demonstrated greatly improved predictive reliability for piles driven in a\u000d\u000a      broad range of geomaterials. The standard errors of conventional capacity\u000d\u000a      predictions (around 65%) were reduced to 20-30%. A practical design book\u000d\u000a      was produced in 1996 and short courses run for leading companies,\u000d\u000a      including Shell &#8212; who awarded a Technology Prize in 1997.\u000d\u000a    (C) Comprehensive investigation took place over 1998-2005 into multiple\u000d\u000a      new factors. One post-doctoral study explored unexpectedly marked\u000d\u000a      beneficial pile ageing and previously neglected cyclic loading degradation\u000d\u000a      through full scale tests and supporting studies funded by EU and Health\u000d\u000a      and Safety Executive (HSE); industrial application was demonstrated\u000d\u000a      through advanced analysis with Atkins. Another PhD study investigated\u000d\u000a      response to seismic loading, considering `anomalous' Gulf of Mexico (USA)\u000d\u000a      and Mexican clays [4]. An HSE supported programme in conjunction with\u000d\u000a      Trinity College Dublin demonstrated previously unappreciated negative pile\u000d\u000a      group effects with industrial-scale piles under static and cyclic loading.\u000d\u000a      Further projects, some involving BP, Shell and Norwegian Geotechnical\u000d\u000a      Institute, investigated pile behaviour under a wide variety of driving and\u000d\u000a      loading conditions. `Problematic' calcareous, diatomaceous,\u000d\u000a      weathered-residual, silt-dominated and sensitive natural deposits were\u000d\u000a      considered as well as `standard' North Sea soils. New insights were gained\u000d\u000a      into all of these topics leading to seven Journal (and multiple\u000d\u000a      Conference) papers, e.g., [2,4]. An updated Design Booklet [G] was\u000d\u000a      published in 2005 by ICE's Thomas Telford Limited that delivered practical\u000d\u000a      guidance on all of these new aspects.\u000d\u000a    (D) New research over 2005-2013 included joint investigations with\u000d\u000a      Professor Pierre Foray and his team at Institut National Polytechnique de\u000d\u000a      Grenoble (INPG) into pile ageing and cyclic loading, working with their\u000d\u000a      intensively instrumented calibration chamber and a new Imperial College\u000d\u000a      instrumented model pile, engaging a post-doctoral and doctoral PhD team\u000d\u000a      [6]. The research led to Jardine taking an advisory role in the French\u000d\u000a      national programme of centrifuge, laboratory, theoretical and field\u000d\u000a      research into pile cyclic loading.\u000d\u000a    New theoretical research is underway with UPC (Catalan Polytechnic\u000d\u000a      University) Barcelona and new journal papers will be published later in\u000d\u000a      2013\/14 with co-workers from Sydney and Zhejiang (China) that test\u000d\u000a      advanced theoretical analyses against the recent model and field test\u000d\u000a      data. The on-going research is underpinning new Journal papers,\u000d\u000a      International Keynotes (including two at the 2013 Paris ICSMGE), grant\u000d\u000a      proposals and updating\/extension of the ICP design approach.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42176","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of the work arises at a number of different levels. In several\u000d\u000a      instances evidence is\u000d\u000a      provided that research results, proposed methodologies or developed models\u000d\u000a      have been\u000d\u000a      incorporated into best practice for the design of new, and the\u000d\u000a      re-assessment of existing, offshore\u000d\u000a      structures. This is often achieved by the inclusion of the work within the\u000d\u000a      recommendations arising\u000d\u000a      from Joint Industry Projects (JIP's); the latter representing a\u000d\u000a      co-ordinated study addressing a\u000d\u000a      specific problem area that has been highlighted by industry as being of\u000d\u000a      practical concern, both\u000d\u000a      from an operational and\/or a safety perspective. In other instances,\u000d\u000a      research results have been\u000d\u000a      used to solve particular design problems. During the period covered, Swan\u000d\u000a      has been involved in\u000d\u000a      six JIP's, each producing its own design guidelines. Most importantly, he\u000d\u000a      has played a major role in\u000d\u000a      setting the scope for two of the largest JIP's ever undertaken in ocean\u000d\u000a      modelling; the CREST and\u000d\u000a      SHORTCREST JIP's. In considering this work it is essential to\u000d\u000a      recognise that, following the loss of\u000d\u000a      the Piper Alpha structure in the North Sea, offshore regulation is much\u000d\u000a      less prescriptive, requiring\u000d\u000a      safety cases to be prepared and justified by owners\/operators. Where\u000d\u000a      research results have been\u000d\u000a      successfully employed in such cases, a material or practical impact has\u000d\u000a      been achieved in the\u000d\u000a      sense that the required reliability (hence safety) has been achieved or\u000d\u000a      the design uncertainty\u000d\u000a      reduced.\u000d\u000a    During 2006-2008 Noble Denton, a leading UK certification agency,\u000d\u000a      undertook a JIP to re-appraise\u000d\u000a      the loading methodology appropriate to Jack-up structures; the purpose of\u000d\u000a      this work being to\u000d\u000a      expand their safe working range [A]. An essential element of this revised\u000d\u000a      methodology was an\u000d\u000a      empirically corrected wave kinematics model; the empirical coefficients\u000d\u000a      being calibrated using the\u000d\u000a      fully nonlinear wave model proposed by Swan [5]. Without the fully\u000d\u000a      nonlinear model, the revised\u000d\u000a      methodology could not have been achieved.\u000d\u000a    The CREST JIP was undertaken from 2007-2010. The technical work\u000d\u000a      was conducted by\u000d\u000a      internationally leading experts and supported by 24 industrial sponsors;\u000d\u000a      the latter including all the\u000d\u000a      major oil companies and numerous regulatory authorities. The only\u000d\u000a      university involved in this work\u000d\u000a      was Imperial College; Swan leading WP2 on nonlinear wave modelling and\u000d\u000a      contributing\u000d\u000a      significantly to WP4 on fluid loading. A key output from this study was\u000d\u000a      the recommendation that the\u000d\u000a      existing crest-height distributions are non-conservative in the most\u000d\u000a      severe sea states; the\u000d\u000a      recommendation being that an additional 5-8% is added to account for the\u000d\u000a      full nonlinearity. This\u000d\u000a      was entirely based upon the work outlined in [5] An additional 1-2 metres\u000d\u000a      of crest elevation has\u000d\u000a      major implications for both the cost \/ design of new structures and the\u000d\u000a      re-appraisal of existing\u000d\u000a      structures. Evidence of the importance of this work being provided by the\u000d\u000a      studies undertaken in\u000d\u000a      respect of the North Rankin A platform (Australia) [C,D], the Arbroath\u000d\u000a      platform (UK &#8212; North Sea) [C]\u000d\u000a      and the Tyra field (Denmark &#8212; North Sea) [D].\u000d\u000a    The CresT JIP also considered the prediction of the wave-induced\u000d\u000a      velocities; the commonly\u000d\u000a      applied design solutions being bench-marked by comparison to the models\u000d\u000a      outlined in [4].\u000d\u000a      Recommendations were made concerning the need to incorporate the essential\u000d\u000a      physics and, in the\u000d\u000a      case of the most extreme waves, to include the full nonlinearity [B].\u000d\u000a      Building on this work, the latest\u000d\u000a      revision of the International Standards Organisation (ISO) design guidance\u000d\u000a      note for offshore\u000d\u000a      structures (Part 1: Metocean design and operating considerations; ISO\u000d\u000a      119901-1. [E]) notes that\u000d\u000a      commonly applied design wave solutions may be \"non-conservative\"\u000d\u000a      and that nonlinear wave\u000d\u000a      models are \"recommended\". Indeed, a new section on nonlinear wave\u000d\u000a      modelling has been\u000d\u000a      introduced. This emphasises the physical properties of real sea states\u000d\u000a      noting that \"for many\u000d\u000a        purposes, a more accurate nonlinear wave model may be helpful or\u000d\u000a        essential\". Indeed, the\u000d\u000a      standard goes further noting that for the calculation of wave-in-deck\u000d\u000a      loads and the wave forces on\u000d\u000a      a fixed structure in steep waves, \"a fully-nonlinear wave model is\u000d\u000a        required\". To date, the only fully\u000d\u000a      nonlinear wave models applied in practical offshore engineering design are\u000d\u000a      based upon those\u000d\u000a      developed by Swan at Imperial College [4].\u000d\u000a    Project specific examples of the impact arising from these wave models\u000d\u000a      are provided as follows. In\u000d\u000a      2008, kinematics calculations undertaken for Conoco Phillips were\u000d\u000a      incorporated into a DNV (one of\u000d\u000a      the largest certification agencies worldwide) technical note concerning\u000d\u000a      the re-appraisal of an\u000d\u000a      existing North Sea structure [F]. They concluded that accurate\u000d\u000a      fully-nonlinear velocities may differ\u000d\u000a      from typical design calculations by as much as 25%; whilst the total\u000d\u000a      sub-structure loads could be\u000d\u000a      reduced by 15%. More recently (2008-2010), calculations undertaken for\u000d\u000a      Woodside Energy Ltd. [C]\u000d\u000a      showed that under tropical cyclone conditions the total sub-structure\u000d\u000a      loads would be reduced by\u000d\u000a      more than 18%. In this case the certification authority (Lloyds Registry)\u000d\u000a      questioned the significant\u000d\u000a      departures from the American Petroleum Institute (API) guidelines. In\u000d\u000a      addressing this point it was\u000d\u000a      shown [C] that the results were not inconsistent, but that accurate\u000d\u000a      kinematics predictions allowed\u000d\u000a      the API guidelines to be extended to the most severe sea states. In both\u000d\u000a      cases the reduction in the\u000d\u000a      applied substructure loads was key to achieving the required reliability\u000d\u000a      and hence the desired life\u000d\u000a      extension.\u000d\u000a    Swan's work concerning the nonlinear wave interactions with large volume\u000d\u000a      concrete structures [6]\u000d\u000a      has also produced important impacts. In the first instance the work was\u000d\u000a      applied to explain the\u000d\u000a      occurrence of wave impacts on the Brent Bravo gravity based structure\u000d\u000a      (GBS) in the North Sea.\u000d\u000a      Having established that the integrity of the structure was not threatened,\u000d\u000a      but that the size and\u000d\u000a      layout of the legs were such that significant wave impacts could arise,\u000d\u000a      the areas of greatest\u000d\u000a      susceptibility were identified together with the magnitude of the maximum\u000d\u000a      loads and the areas over\u000d\u000a      which they act. This was important for the continued operation of the\u000d\u000a      structure. Following this work,\u000d\u000a      the UK HSE funded a JIP on nonlinear inertial loading; the resulting\u000d\u000a      guidance note listed under [G].\u000d\u000a      This work was subsequently incorporated into the ISO technical note on the\u000d\u000a      design of offshore\u000d\u000a      concrete structures [H]. This specifically comments on the unexpected\u000d\u000a      occurrence of wave impacts\u000d\u000a      and the need for detailed model testing. Based on this approach we have:\u000d\u000a      (a) Examined the\u000d\u000a      optimal column size and layout from the perspective of wave loading and\u000d\u000a      wave impacts on a new-build\u000d\u000a      GBS. (b) Addressed difficulties arising at the Sleipner A GBS in the North\u000d\u000a      Sea; a structure\u000d\u000a      that is integral to the UK gas supply from Norwegian fields and which has\u000d\u000a      suffered unexpected\u000d\u000a      shut downs due to the occurrence of wave impacts. This work has considered\u000d\u000a      the wave impact\u000d\u000a      loads arising on the column face, the underside of the deck structure, on\u000d\u000a      essential safety\u000d\u000a      equipment (including free-fall life boats) and, most recently, the loads\u000d\u000a      on newly installed processing\u000d\u000a      equipment [I]. (c) Assessed the implication of the wave-structure\u000d\u000a      interaction for the\u000d\u000a      decommissioning of the Brent Delta GBS. This structure is the first of its\u000d\u000a      kind\/size to be\u000d\u000a      decommissioned. Work undertaken by Swan has quantified the kinematic\u000d\u000a      enhancement factors,\u000d\u000a      allowing the fluid loads on subsea infrastructure, essential to the\u000d\u000a      initial stages of the\u000d\u000a      decommissioning, to be calculated [C]. This information was vital to\u000d\u000a      ensure the proposed\u000d\u000a      decommissioning can be undertaken with the appropriate environmental\u000d\u000a      safeguards.\u000d\u000a    Our work on shallow water wave modelling [3] has also produced a number\u000d\u000a      of key impacts. This\u000d\u000a      work led to our participation in the LOWISH JIP. This project was\u000d\u000a      managed by Shell International\u000d\u000a      and supported by 5 major oil companies. A key output from this study was a\u000d\u000a      new laboratory data\u000d\u000a      base generated by Swan at Imperial College. The immediate impacts arising\u000d\u000a      from this work were\u000d\u000a      (a) design guidance on shallow water wave statistics, (b) updated breaking\u000d\u000a      criteria for waves on\u000d\u000a      mild bed slopes and (c) guidance on kinematics predictions [D]. More\u000d\u000a      recently, others have applied\u000d\u000a      this data base producing the following impacts: (a) Improved calibration\u000d\u000a      of the breaking module\u000d\u000a      within the SWAN shallow water wave model [D]. This model\u000d\u000a      originates from TUDelft and is\u000d\u000a      extensively applied in design applications world-wide. This work was\u000d\u000a      supported by the US National\u000d\u000a      Oceanographic Partnership Programme (NOPP) and funded by the US\u000d\u000a      Office of Naval Research.\u000d\u000a      (b) The formulation and validation of a new empirical wave height\u000d\u000a      distribution model developed in-house\u000d\u000a      by Shell [D]. (c) The overall recommendations of the LOWISH JIP,\u000d\u000a      to which the laboratory\u000d\u000a      data generated by Swan contributed greatly, have been incorporated within\u000d\u000a      a leading hindcast\u000d\u000a      model; the latter work undertaken by Ocean Weather Inc. as part of the\u000d\u000a      Southern North Sea\u000d\u000a      Extension Hindcast (SNEXT) JIP [D]. (e) It has also provided new\u000d\u000a      design wave kinematics for the\u000d\u000a      PLUTO pipeline, a large infrastructure project extending across the\u000d\u000a      continental shelf of north-west\u000d\u000a      Australia [J].\u000d\u000a    Finally, our expertise in nonlinear wave modelling and laboratory wave\u000d\u000a      generation led to the\u000d\u000a      development of a theoretical transfer function, optimising the performance\u000d\u000a      of force controlled wave\u000d\u000a      machines. This has facilitated further industrial impact in terms of\u000d\u000a      assisting specialist UK\u000d\u000a      manufacturers to secure international orders. Edinburgh Designs Ltd.,\u000d\u000a      implemented this work as an\u000d\u000a      integral part of their software control, regarding it as a key component\u000d\u000a      in successful bids to supply\u000d\u000a      wave makers for two very large model testing facilities [K]. The first of\u000d\u000a      these was at MARIN (the\u000d\u000a      Maritime Research Institute, Netherlands), and the second the Naval\u000d\u000a      Surface Warfare Centre at\u000d\u000a      Carderock, USA.

The key\u000d\u000a      achievements have been to provide an improved physical understanding of\u000d\u000a      the evolution of the\u000d\u000a      largest waves [1,2,3]; to incorporate the essential physics into improved\u000d\u000a      numerical models [4]; to\u000d\u000a      quantify the exceedence probabilities of the largest waves [5]; and to\u000d\u000a      describe the nature of the\u000d\u000a      wave-structure interactions, including the prediction of the applied fluid\u000d\u000a      loads [6]. The work has\u000d\u000a      been led by Professor Chris Swan and has involved close collaboration with\u000d\u000a      leading industrial\u000d\u000a      practitioners including major oil companies (BP, Conoco-Phillips, Maersk,\u000d\u000a      Shell, Statoil, Talisman\u000d\u000a      and Woodside), specialist consultancies (Arup, JP Kenny and WS Atkins) and\u000d\u000a      international\u000d\u000a      regulatory authorities (ABS, BV, DNV and UK HSE).\u000d\u000a    All sea states are characterised by their frequency and directional\u000d\u000a      spectra. For design purposes,\u000d\u000a      both are assumed constant over time-scales corresponding to hundreds of\u000d\u000a      wave cycles. A key\u000d\u000a      aspect of our research has been to establish that the underlying spectra\u000d\u000a      may undergo rapid and\u000d\u000a      highly localised change in the vicinity of a large wave event. In deep\u000d\u000a      water this causes a\u000d\u000a      broadening of the frequency spectrum, the potential for higher energy\u000d\u000a      densities and hence larger\u000d\u000a      crest elevations [1,2,3,5]. These effects are critically dependent upon\u000d\u000a      both the steepness and\u000d\u000a      directionality of the sea state and provide an explanation for the\u000d\u000a      occurrence of \"freak\" or \"rogue\"\u000d\u000a      waves [5]; the latter believed to be responsible for the damage\/failure of\u000d\u000a      fixed structures and\u000d\u000a      numerous shipping losses.\u000d\u000a    In seeking to describe extreme waves, particularly the kinematics\u000d\u000a      necessary for the calculation of\u000d\u000a      fluid loads, our research has shown that it is essential that any model\u000d\u000a      incorporates the underlying\u000d\u000a      physics of the sea state; specifically its nonlinearity, unsteadiness and\u000d\u000a      directionality. This had led\u000d\u000a      to improved wave models based upon high-order spectral methods and new\u000d\u000a      boundary element\u000d\u000a      formulations [4]. By combining the respective advantages of experimental\u000d\u000a      and numerical\u000d\u000a      modelling, we have been able to describe and explain the increased crest\u000d\u000a      heights arising at small\u000d\u000a      exceedence probabilities, to provide fully nonlinear statistical\u000d\u000a      distributions covering a broad range\u000d\u000a      of sea states, to identify those sea states in which nonlinear effects are\u000d\u000a      most likely to be significant,\u000d\u000a      and to provide relatively simple (design-orientated) solutions appropriate\u000d\u000a      to their quantification in\u000d\u000a      both deep and shallow water [5].\u000d\u000a    Building upon the success of our wave models [4] three important aspects\u000d\u000a      of wave loading have\u000d\u000a      been addressed:\u000d\u000a    (a) The prediction of wave-in-deck loads. This has shown that the maximum\u000d\u000a      fluid velocities high\u000d\u000a      in the wave crest may be substantially (30%) larger than previously\u000d\u000a      predicted. With impact\u000d\u000a      loads dependent upon the square of the fluid velocity, the importance of\u000d\u000a      accurate kinematic\u000d\u000a      predictions is clear.\u000d\u000a    (b) The prediction of global sub-structure loads. With wave energy\u000d\u000a      transferred to the higher\u000d\u000a      frequencies, the spatial dimensions of the largest waves will differ from\u000d\u000a      traditional solutions.\u000d\u000a      As a result, the global loads acting on a space-frame structure with\u000d\u000a      significant plan\u000d\u000a      dimensions will be critically dependent upon the applied wave model; the\u000d\u000a      commonly applied\u000d\u000a      solutions being excessively conservative.\u000d\u000a    (c) The interaction between waves and large volume structures. In such\u000d\u000a      cases, unexpected\u000d\u000a      loading components have been shown to relate to the scattering of\u000d\u000a      high-frequency waves\u000d\u000a      not predicted by existing diffraction solutions. These effects are closely\u000d\u000a      related to the onset\u000d\u000a      of transient structural deflections, the increased occurrence of wave\u000d\u000a      slamming, and the loss\u000d\u000a      of air-gap due to amplifications of the maximum crest elevation [6]\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42177","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and 2013, 98 research projects were defined by industry,\u000d\u000a      completed by Imperial and disseminated to public transport operators\u000d\u000a      worldwide.

Six to seven\u000d\u000a      months after the research is commissioned, results are presented by\u000d\u000a      Imperial at annual consortia meetings where CEOs and COOs discuss\u000d\u000a      Imperial's research findings and how they can be implemented by their own\u000d\u000a      organisations. Further research is often commissioned to enrich\u000d\u000a      understanding and bring the recommendations closer to implementation;\u000d\u000a      on-going work is, frequently facilitated by additional workshops, led by\u000d\u000a      Imperial and attended by experts from transport operators. We have\u000d\u000a      established confidential website forums where industry experts can share\u000d\u000a      further information and ideas based on the research. International\u000d\u000a      adaptation of research recommendations is aided by the translation of\u000d\u000a      reports into 6 different languages.

This has impacted on a broad range of\u000a      beneficiaries such as London Underground, Thames Water, BP America,\u000a      Crossrail, Health and Safety Executive, British Airport Authority, Shell,\u000a      Rome Metro and Darwin Port, by providing solutions that led to design cost\u000a      savings, reduced environmental impact of construction, and\/or enhanced\u000a      safety of construction [A]. In most of these projects ICFEP was employed\u000a      due to the inadequacy of commercial software and\/or the IC's ability to\u000a      develop specific numerical algorithms that were necessary for some of the\u000a      projects. Four of the most significant projects from the past 5 years are\u000a      described below as examples of impact.\u000a    4.2 Mardi Gras\u000a    In the Gulf of Mexico, BP America is carrying out hydrocarbon exploration\u000a      in geologically young and active regions, where kilometres of escarpments,\u000a      approximately 700m high, have been created by locally uplifting and\u000a      translating salt diapirs and simultaneous large scale sediment deposition\u000a      in water depths over 1km. Large underwater slope failures of these\u000a      escarpments present a significant geotechnical hazard to exploration\u000a      equipment, with a potentially catastrophic environmental impact. Between\u000a      2008 and 2011 an IC\/GCG team carried out studies using ICFEP for BP\u000a      America's Mardi Gras project &#8212; a billion dollar highest capacity deepwater\u000a      pipeline system ever built &#8212; confirming that periods of slope instability\u000a      were likely to have occurred in the past and should be expected in the\u000a      future, but that these processes developed over hundreds, rather than\u000a      thousands of years as previously thought. The analysis of such a complex\u000a      geological setting, which followed the progressive failure modelling\u000a      approach developed in [2], required the use of ICFEP's large displacement\u000a      and coupled consolidation facilities, as well as the specific development\u000a      of novel methods for simulating the underwater deposition of geomaterials\u000a      [3]. The outcome of the performed analyses had a direct impact on risk\u000a      assessments, by identifying reasonable estimates for the current annual\u000a      probability of slope failure, which enabled BP America \"to more\u000a      effectively determine how to properly locate pipelines and facilities and\u000a      mitigate risk along this escarpment\" [B].\u000a    4.3 Abberton Reservoir\u000a    Following the forecast of a substantial growth in future demand for\u000a      public water supply in the east of England, Northumbrian Water opted to\u000a      raise the water level in Abberton Reservoir, the largest freshwater body\u000a      in Essex, by 3.2m (resulting in an increase in reservoir capacity of 58%).\u000a      Given the complex history of the reservoir, which involved the failure of\u000a      the original dam in 1937 and its reconstruction in 1938, as well as its\u000a      status of an environmental haven, designated as a Special Protection Area\u000a      (SPA), IC\/GCG were commissioned in 2009 by the main designer MWH\u000a      (Montgomery-Watson-Harza) to carry out a numerical study of the planned\u000a      raising of Abberton's main dam. ICFEP's unique combination of advanced\u000a      constitutive relationships [4], coupled consolidation capabilities and\u000a      progressive failure facilities [2], enabled the successful simulation of\u000a      the complete dam history, including the prediction of the failure of the\u000a      original dam and the post-reconstruction behaviour of the existing dam.\u000a      This gave credibility to the results obtained from the subsequent\u000a      modelling of the dam rising, which demonstrated satisfactory embankment\u000a      stability during all phases of work. The analyses were pivotal in\u000a      developing the design solution for the steeper downstream slope, impacting\u000a      directly on the design cost by reducing the use of land and the amount of\u000a      fill material for dam raising, thus also having a significantly positive\u000a      environmental impact, with different aspects of savings amounting to an\u000a      estimated several tens of millions of pounds. The convincing analyses\u000a      results contributed to the efficient approval of the planning permission\u000a      by presenting the solution which persuaded the stakeholders that the SPA\u000a      will not be degraded. The raising of the dam has now been successfully\u000a      completed and MWH note the fact that \"this is the first time that an SPA\u000a      has been altered in Europe and to do so without recourse to Public Inquiry\u000a      is a notable success\" [C].\u000a    4.4 Crossrail\u000a    Crossrail is the biggest tunnelling project in London in recent history,\u000a      both in monetary value and the length of tunnel construction. The main\u000a      challenge of the project is to ensure the stability, applying accurate\u000a      assessment of ground movements, of existing undergrounding lines,\u000a      utilities, services and building foundations in Central London, due to the\u000a      construction of new 21 km long twin bore tunnels. An additional challenge\u000a      is that new tunnels run at about 40 m depth, requiring access via deep\u000a      station boxes, a type of structure for which there is little prior\u000a      experience in London. Following the outcome of key research carried out at\u000a      IC, [5], the Crossail project team commissioned IC\/GCG between 2008 and\u000a      2011 to perform a 3D FE study to establish assessment procedures for\u000a      ground movements induced by box excavations. In addition to ICFEP's\u000a      capabilities in reproducing the nonlinearity of soil behaviour at small\u000a      strains, advanced constitutive models for shell elements were used to\u000a      model the retaining walls of the box excavations. By providing more\u000a      accurate estimates of ground movements, this study reduced the\u000a      geotechnical risk associated with estimation of building damage caused by\u000a      the deployment of the Crossrail project, compared to standard assessment\u000a      methods. It is estimated that the developed assessment procedure led to\u000a      about 350 critical buildings along the Crossrail route (a quarter of the\u000a      total number) being eliminated from further detailed assessment and costly\u000a      structural survey [D].\u000a    4.5 Panama Canal\u000a    The Panama Canal is a key water route for global trade and security\u000a      between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and a primary source of income to\u000a      Panama, contributing to 30% of its GDP. Its width governs the maximum size\u000a      of container ships and warships passing through and studies at the\u000a      beginning of this century showed that the Canal was operating close to its\u000a      maximum capacity, thus generating the need for its expansion. In 2009\u000a      IC\/GCG was commissioned to assess Royal Haskoning's solution for widening\u000a      and deepening of the Panama Canal including the construction of a third\u000a      set of locks. Due to the high seismicity in the area, the main concern of\u000a      the design was the potential for a rocking mode of deformation of the high\u000a      lock walls and the risk of up-lift and pounding of the central lock\u000a      foundations in the event of a strong earthquake. ICFEP's advanced\u000a      capabilities in terms of coupled consolidation analyses under dynamic\u000a      solicitations, [6], and cyclic nonlinear constitutive modelling, as\u000a      opposed to industry practice of simple pseudo-static or equivalent linear\u000a      modelling, demonstrated that such a mode of deformation would not occur\u000a      under the design earthquakes. These results impacted directly the design,\u000a      with significant savings made on construction material and construction\u000a      time. [E]\u000a    4.6 Examples of other lasting impact\u000a    Stabilisation of the Leaning Tower of Pisa: ICFEP was key software\u000a      in the development of stabilisation solutions for the tower and prevention\u000a      of its collapse (1992 - 2000); the remarkable agreement between measured\u000a      and predicted (by ICFEP) tower's response to implementation of temporary\u000a      stabilisation (counterweight) in 1993\/94 and subsequent permanent\u000a      stabilisation (soil extraction) in 1999\/2000, enabled the understanding of\u000a      the basic mechanism of the ground-tower interaction, which was otherwise\u000a      impossible to assess [F]; it provided confidence to the long-term\u000a      stability of the adopted permanent solution, leading to the eventual\u000a      re-opening of the tower to public access in Dec. 2001; continuous\u000a      monitoring of the tower to date shows no signs of further lean, hence\u000a      enabling its open access and providing lasting confidence in ICFEP's\u000a      predictions. A number of outreach lectures, TV and radio broadcasts have\u000a      presented the Pisa research (e.g., article in The Daily Telegraph\u000a      Newspaper on the 28 Jul 2010 http:\/\/bit.ly\/dy9Y8Z\u000a      [J] and a BBC One `One Show' feature on 6 May 2011 [K]).\u000a    Two text books on finite element analysis in geotechnical\u000a      engineering, [G, H]; presenting both the finite element theory and its\u000a      practical application on real geotechnical problems, as developed and\u000a      applied in ICFEP, these books have been not only an essential academic\u000a      text, but also a source of guidance for appropriate use of numerical\u000a      methods by industry; they continue to be re-printed to date and have just\u000a      been issued as eBooks by the publisher Thomas Telford; due to a specific\u000a      demand, the books were translated into Chinese and published by the China\u000a      Science Press in 2010.\u000a    ICE Manual of Geotechnical Engineering [I]; Chapter 6 of this\u000a      manual is dedicated to computational geotechnical analysis, providing\u000a      guidance on the correct use of numerical analysis, based on experiences\u000a      gained through application of ICFEP in solving real geotechnical problems.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The development of the bespoke finite element software ICFEP (Imperial\u000a      College Finite Element Program) is the main research outcome of the\u000a      numerical group in the Geotechnics Section at Imperial College (IC). The\u000a      research conducted in the Section since 1993 has led to a substantial\u000a      growth of ICFEP's modelling capabilities in both complexity and\u000a      robustness, following closely the advancements in understanding of real\u000a      soil behaviour achieved through laboratory and field investigations of\u000a      soils. Between 2008 and 2013 the application of these modelling\u000a      capabilities to practical engineering problems, which are generally\u000a      unavailable with a similar degree of sophistication in commercial\u000a      software, amounts to over 80 projects of which a third are worth\u000a      multi-billion pounds in global value. The impact of ICFEP's application\u000a      has been to reduce the geotechnical risk and the cost of design and\u000a      construction, and to give confidence in the environmental stability of\u000a      design solutions, by providing accurate predictions of soil response\u000a      associated with individual projects.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000a    Imperial College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Imperial College London","InstitutionName":"Imperial College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003270}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    *References that best indicate quality of underpinning research\u000a    \u000a[1] Dounias G.T., Potts D.M. and Vaughan P.R.

The research described in this section\u000a      focuses only on developments that have been utilised directly in the\u000a      projects that describe the impact in Section 4.\u000a    Progressive failure is characteristic of soils with brittle\u000a      behaviour, where soil strength reduces gradually with deformation level,\u000a      leading to ultimate collapse. Since traditional methods of analysis are\u000a      unable to predict the impact of progressive failure, the development of\u000a      advanced numerical tools for the simulation of this complex phenomenon has\u000a      been a central topic in the research carried out between 1993 and 1997 by\u000a      Potts (academic staff member since 1979). The implementation of coupled\u000a      consolidation facilities in ICFEP, as well as that of strain-softening\u000a      constitutive models and porosity\/stress level-dependent soil permeability\u000a      models, enabled the quantification, for the first time, of the\u000a      geotechnical risk associated with mechanisms of progressive failure in cut\u000a      slopes and embankment dams. This pioneering research led to the\u000a      prize-winning publications [1] and [2], the latter becoming the key\u000a      reference for the development of design strategies for such structures.\u000a      More recently, in order to extend this procedure to the simulation of\u000a      progressive failure of large underwater slopes, Potts developed advanced\u000a      boundary conditions and specific numerical strategies, [3], to combine\u000a      this type of analysis with ICFEP's large deformation capabilities.\u000a    Assessment of serviceability limit states ( SLS) of geotechnical\u000a      structures has been one of the constant drivers for numerical developments\u000a      in ICFEP, as the demand for increased accuracy of predicted ground\u000a      movements due to construction has grown rapidly over the years. This was\u000a      particularly important for urban environments such as London, where design\u000a      requires assessments of damage induced to existing structures and services\u000a      by e.g. tunnelling or deep excavations. To address this type of problem,\u000a      both new constitutive relationships aimed at reproducing soil behaviour\u000a      under a wide range of strains, and novel numerical strategies for\u000a      simulating structural elements, were implemented into ICFEP. With respect\u000a      to the former, the initial isotropic nonlinear elastic soil models were\u000a      systematically applied and developed further through the PhD research of\u000a      Addenbrooke (1992-1996), Franzius (2001-2004) and Grammatikopoulou\u000a      (2000-2004), the latter developing the most advanced framework [4].\u000a      Concurrently, the 3D modelling capabilities of ICFEP were enhanced with\u000a      the development of novel structural shell elements and their constitutive\u000a      models through the PhD research of Schroeder (1998-2002). The academic\u000a      staff involved with these PhDs include Potts and Zdravkovic (academic\u000a      staff member since 1999). The findings of this research enabled the\u000a      quantification of the effects that nonlinearity, anisotropy and plasticity\u000a      below gross yield have on the predictions of ground movements, in\u000a      particular around tunnels and deep excavations. Moreover, the advanced\u000a      modelling of structural components (such as tunnel linings and retaining\u000a      walls), accounting for anisotropy of their axial and bending stiffness,\u000a      clearly showed that an isotropic idealisation, which is standard in design\u000a      practice, leads to unsafe predictions of ground movements. Most of this\u000a      research originated from the group's involvement with the Jubilee Line\u000a      Extension project in London between 1993 and 1996, and was instrumental in\u000a      subsequent studies, [5], performed for the Crossrail project in London\u000a      from 2003 to 2010.\u000a    Since 1999 a significant effort has been applied to the development and\u000a      implementation of advanced dynamic analysis capabilities in ICFEP,\u000a      which enabled the investigation of earthquake engineering and general\u000a      dynamic soil problems.

Apart from the formulation and implementation of a coupled\u000a      consolidation dynamics framework into ICFEP, three novel developments\u000a      during this research have been particularly successful: efficient and\u000a      accurate time integration schemes, a sub-structuring approach in terms of\u000a      the domain reduction method, [6], and advanced constitutive models that\u000a      can account for soil response under cyclic loading, including the\u000a      prediction of the occurrence of liquefaction.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42179","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our floods research has had substantial impacts on floods policy and\u000d\u000a      design practice, and on attitudes and unde rstanding of flood risks\u000d\u000a      olutions by audiences ranging from land owners to national governments.\u000d\u000a      These impacts extend across all components &#8212; rainfall modelling,\u000d\u000a      experimental evidence, and catchment and urban modelling.\u000d\u000a    4.1 Rainfall modelling\u000d\u000a    Research into rainfall modelling has led to the development of tools for\u000d\u000a      hydrological and drainage system design using continuous simulation rather\u000d\u000a      than single design events, a development encouraged by the Environment\u000d\u000a      Agency.

It has been\u000d\u000a    purchased by a number of consultancies and water companies (e.g. MWH,\u000d\u000a    B&amp;V, Yorkshire Water, United Utilities and Southern Water) at a unit\u000d\u000a    cost of &#163;900 [A]. TSRSim was used as an alternative to traditional design\u000d\u000a    storms across the Southern Water area to estimate floods with a return\u000d\u000a    period of 1 in 30 years. The flexibility of this tool is estimated by MWH to\u000d\u000a    have enabled savings of the order of &#163;2 Million on a programme valued at &#163;80\u000d\u000a    Million [B].\u000d\u000a    4.2 Land use management\u000d\u000a    Our experimental evidence on the physical links between rural land use\u000d\u000a      and floods (Wheater et al.) has fundamentally changed national attitudes\u000d\u000a      and policy. For example, we refer to the Pontbren hydrology work,\u000d\u000a      described in Section 2 (underpinning research) which was jointly run by\u000d\u000a      Imperial College and CEH Bangor (50%\/50%). From the Woodland Trust Wales\u000d\u000a      report, the \"Pontbren work has fundamentally changed our understanding of\u000d\u000a      the role of broadleaved trees in the farmed landscape and is now changing\u000d\u000a      policy and practice\" [C]. Hence the research on trees and flooding has had\u000d\u000a      a direct influence on the Welsh Government's new land management scheme\u000d\u000a      for Wales [D] (`Glastir') and local implementations The Coed Cadw will\u000d\u000a      confirm that the next Rural Development Plan for Wales (2013-2020) is\u000d\u000a      drawing heavily on the experience and the evidence derived from Pontbren\u000d\u000a      and that it will influence the shape and focus of future agri-environment\u000d\u000a      payments to farmers [E].\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research on soil hydrology and land use has been used\u000d\u000a      directly by the Environment Agency Wales to map priority areas for\u000d\u000a      improved land management. One of the GIS water quantity layers was based\u000d\u000a      around the evidence from Pontbren and key areas in Wales have been\u000d\u000a      identified where similar activities to those within Pontbren could lead to\u000d\u000a      a reduction in flood risk in the upper Severn [D], with consequent\u000d\u000a      benefits for western England. Another example of the impact of the new\u000d\u000a      evidence and numerical model results was their use in the Foresight Future\u000d\u000a      Flooding update, which contributed to the Cabinet Office's 2008 policy\u000d\u000a      report (the \"Pitt Review\") recommendation that \"rural land management\u000d\u000a      approaches should be considered as part of the portfolio of measures to\u000d\u000a      deal with flood risk and, where appropriate, as part of the programme to\u000d\u000a      deliver more working with natural processes\" [F]. They have also been used\u000d\u000a      to guide the Office of Public Works (Ireland) in informing the Directorate\u000d\u000a      General's review of climate proofing. Our research into flood flow\u000d\u000a      modelling approaches has also had a major impact on training and education\u000d\u000a      of students and practitioners, demonstrated by sales of our books [G] and\u000d\u000a      downloads of our teaching software.\u000d\u000a    4.3 Urban pluvial flood modelling\u000d\u000a    The urban floods research has delivered models that have impacted practice\u000d\u000a    in flood studies in the UK and internationally. In 1998 we took part in the\u000d\u000a    CIRIA (Construction Industry Research and Information Association) Committee\u000d\u000a    for development of CIRIA555 Sustainable Urban Drainage Design and Best\u000d\u000a    Practice Manual, in which the term \"SUDS\" was coined, resulting in the\u000d\u000a    industry training module which has been used ever since. Our AOFD method and\u000d\u000a    software tool (see underpinning research section) has been independently\u000d\u000a    evaluated and recommended for practical use by the UK Water Industry\u000d\u000a    Research organisation (UKWIR). Before this model there was no appropriate\u000d\u000a    software product on the market that would enable automatic processing of\u000d\u000a    urban drainage features needed for reliable modelling of urban runoff, and\u000d\u000a    it now forms the basis of commercial software (e.g. Infoworks and TuFlow)\u000d\u000a    which are dominating UK and many international markets [H].\u000d\u000a    This tool has been used extensively by consultants for mapping surface\u000d\u000a      water flood risk in the UK (Colindale, Borough of Barnet [H]) and in\u000d\u000a      several cities in Serbia (e.g. Novi Beograd, Novi Sad, Sabac). Its\u000d\u000a      inclusion into an integrated modelling system, 3DNet-SewNet, has led to\u000d\u000a      the software being used by a significant percentage (cc 50%) of younger\u000d\u000a      and mid-career professionals in Serbia and neighbouring countries.\u000d\u000a      Similarly, the AOFD method and its principles have been incorporated into\u000d\u000a      the latest version of the main commercial software package in Germany\u000d\u000a      (Graphical Interactive Planning system &#8212; GIPS) by ITWH (Hannover) [I]. The\u000d\u000a      GIPS \"has over 500 users predominantly in German speaking countries. This\u000d\u000a      is now a customer system with about &#8364;2.5M market value\"[I]. Our\u000d\u000a      methodology for storm drainage master planning has had clear societal and\u000d\u000a      economic impacts: it has been adopt ed by the Brazilian consortium (\u000d\u000a      Enger, Promon, CKC) and used by the chief consultant company Hidrostudio\u000d\u000a      in development of the Master Drainage Plan for the River Tiete in Sao\u000d\u000a      Paulo, Brazil, which was then used over the last 12 years for detailed\u000d\u000a      planning of improvements to Sao Paulo's drainage. Additionally, in the\u000d\u000a      most recent project for urban flood mitigation project of the Sao Paulo's\u000d\u000a      central commercial area (Anhangabau), the AOFD model has been used for\u000d\u000a      assessment of flood risk.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Our research and resulting impacts extend across a wide range of&#160;\u000d\u000a      flooding problems, from localised urban floods to river bas in flooding.\u000d\u000a      The under pinning research ranges from extending the evidence base, to\u000d\u000a      improved rainfall estimates, and to advances in hydrological and hydraulic\u000d\u000a      models.

Since its inception in 1993, this programme of research has\u000d\u000a    i nvolved a number of academics including H. Wheater (1993-2010), N.\u000d\u000a    McIntyre (1999-2013), C. Maksimovi&#263; (1997-2013); C. Onof (1995-2013), N.\u000d\u000a    Bulygina (2007-13) and D.

Our programme of rainfall research has\u000d\u000a      provided the bas is for improvements using continuous simulation of\u000d\u000a      rainfall. Building on fundamental research into stochastic rainfall\u000d\u000a      modelling from 1993-2002 Onof and Wheater subsequently (2002-05) developed\u000d\u000a      new methods for generating daily rainfall simultaneously at a number of\u000d\u000a      sites while maintaining its complex space-time properties, including the\u000d\u000a      ability to synthesise extreme rainfall [1]. This was achieved by\u000d\u000a      developing techniques based on point process and generalised linear\u000d\u000a      models. This Defra funded research was extended (2005-2006) to adapt the\u000d\u000a      method so that it can estimate space-time rainfall under climate change.\u000d\u000a      In a third aspect of the work, based on continuous studies since 1993,\u000d\u000a      Onof has developed methods for the downscaling of daily rainfall to\u000d\u000a      high-resolution (e.g., hourly or 5-minute) rainfall, to provide a unique\u000d\u000a      ability to simulate bursts of rainfall, including under climate change,\u000d\u000a      thus, in particular, meeting the needs of urban drainage design [2].\u000d\u000a      Together, these elements of underpinning research led to the software\u000d\u000a      packages, HYETOS, GLIMCLIM, and TSRSsim, which have been widely used by\u000d\u000a      consultants and government agencies during 2008-2013 (see section 4).\u000d\u000a    2.2 Land use management\u000d\u000a    There is widespread speculation that reverting towards a more natural\u000d\u000a      rural landscape will reduce downstream flood risk, and there is major\u000d\u000a      interest and activity in UK government in implementing \"natural flood\u000d\u000a      management\". However, prior to our series of RCUK funded research projects\u000d\u000a      in the period 2004 -2012, there was insufficient evidence and methods to\u000d\u000a      evaluate the efficacy of such \"natural\" approaches. From our sets of\u000d\u000a      experimental sites at Pontbren, Wales ( 2004-2012), Wheater, McIntyre and\u000d\u000a      Bulygina produced evidence of the links between soil type, land management\u000d\u000a      and flood flows; and how upland land management can (and cannot) be used\u000d\u000a      to control floods; and how it can also provide other environmental\u000d\u000a      benefits as part of agri-environment schemes [3,4]. Furthermore, so that\u000d\u000a      scenarios of change can be assessed in terms of flood risk and as sociated\u000d\u000a      costs and benefits for arange of catchments, we developed new\u000d\u000a      generalisation and upscaling techniques [4]. This modelling research\u000d\u000a      programme is providing an evolving national capability for continuous-time\u000d\u000a      simulation of floods, leading in 2004-2012 to the focus on solving the\u000d\u000a      \"natural flood management\" question.\u000d\u000a    2.3 Urban pluvial flood modelling\u000d\u000a    For the urban environment, Maksimovi&#263; and Butler have conducted research\u000d\u000a      that has promoted the use of physically based approaches to improve models\u000d\u000a      of urban pluvial flooding, and to reduce the uncertainty in the spatial\u000d\u000a      and temporal modelling. From 1999-2009, our research into processing of\u000d\u000a      digital terrain data led to improved automatic delineation of flood-prone\u000d\u000a      areas in urban catchments and the development of our Automatic Overland\u000d\u000a      Flood Delineation (AOFD) method [5]. Research from 2004-2012 produced new\u000d\u000a      methods for 1D\/1D urban flood modelling suitable for real time\u000d\u000a      applications, incorporating the AOFD method [6]. These latter two items of\u000d\u000a      underpinning research produced the predecessors to the modern commercial\u000d\u000a      models for urban pluvial flood modelling (see section 4).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42180","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Graham's academic research undertaken at Imperial in 2001 provided an\u000d\u000a      initial general approach for measuring the effects of accessibility on\u000d\u000a      productivity. In 2005 the UK DfT commissioned him to develop this work to\u000d\u000a      devise a specific approach to WEI estimation that would produce empirical\u000d\u000a      results compatible with existing methods of appraisal [1,3,5]. Between\u000d\u000a      2005 and 2008 the DfT disseminated the results of the Imperial research in\u000d\u000a      a series of high-profile conferences, seminars and workshops aimed at\u000d\u000a      informing civil servants and professional analysts about these new\u000d\u000a      techniques.

The Eddington Report included detailed applications of the\u000d\u000a      WEI approach to appraisal and argued that it provided a superior tool for\u000d\u000a      decisions support than conventional CBA.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the research on WEIs is that it has led to an\u000d\u000a      important reform of CBA for project appraisal of transport schemes, and\u000d\u000a      consequently has influenced investment planning at national and local\u000d\u000a      levels [A-E]. Following publication of this work the DfT subsequently\u000d\u000a      undertook a major revision of their CBA methodology (2007-2009) based on\u000d\u000a      Imperial's approach for the assessment of WEIs and in 2009 formally\u000d\u000a      incorporated Graham's estimates in the DfT web based CBA guidance (WebTAG)\u000d\u000a      (see http:\/\/www.dft.gov.uk\/webtag\/documents\/expert\/pdf\/U3_5_14-wider-impacts120723.pdf)\u000d\u000a      [A,B,C]. Interest in WEIs spread rapidly and has been taken up by national\u000d\u000a      Governments and public authorities throughout the world as a decision\u000d\u000a      support tool. It is now used routinely by the transport modelling\u000d\u000a      profession as the standard approach for WEI assessment.\u000d\u000a    Within the UK, high-profile examples of the direct application of the\u000d\u000a      Imperial approach (with economic value indicated) include CrossRail (2010)\u000d\u000a      (&#163;16bn) [F], High Speed 2 (2010, 2012) (&#163;50bn) [G], Manchester Rail Hub\u000d\u000a      (2009) (&#163;530m), and the Leeds city-region transport strategy (2009-2012)\u000d\u000a      (&#163;4bn). Indications are that it will be used to assess the case for\u000d\u000a      CrossRail 2.\u000d\u000a    Following formal adoption of the WEI approach in the UK interest spread\u000d\u000a      throughout the world. Initial international applications took place in\u000d\u000a      Australia (2011) [J], New Zealand (2010, 2011) [H, I], and the USA (2009).\u000d\u000a      We have been active in leading the spread of our approach worldwide.

Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      recent desktop research of impacts finds much more extensive use of\u000d\u000a      concepts and calculations derived from the research. The fundamental\u000d\u000a      contribution of the work lies in developing an empirical approach to\u000d\u000a      capture the productivity effects of changes in the transport network. This\u000d\u000a      is done by estimating a set of parameters that will typically differ by\u000d\u000a      country, and possibly by regions of countries, and there is therefore a\u000d\u000a      very large scale of on-going work to roll the approach out in different\u000d\u000a      countries.\u000d\u000a    The benefits of the research accrue to many different groups in society.\u000d\u000a      It offers Governments improved information upon which to make decisions\u000d\u000a      about transport investments, and in so doing, can support improvements in\u000d\u000a      economic growth and productivity for regions and nations. It provides the\u000d\u000a      transport profession with more robust ways of modelling the impacts of\u000d\u000a      investment on the economy, and it advances the scope and influence of the\u000d\u000a      transport modelling discipline. It allows interest groups and societal\u000d\u000a      organisation access to more reliable information about the impacts of\u000d\u000a      infrastructure proposals that affect them. Finally, it aids the\u000d\u000a      coordination and planning of major infrastructure projects and helps in\u000d\u000a      prioritising transport spending to achieve better outcomes for society in\u000d\u000a      terms of value for money, economic growth and productivity.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study describes impacts on the professional practice of\u000d\u000a      transport appraisal, and on investment planning at national and local\u000d\u000a      levels, arising from an approach developed over the period 2005-2013 to\u000d\u000a      estimate the Wider Economic Impacts (WEIs) of transport investments.

While\u000d\u000a      CBA has proven to be a useful tool for comparative assessment of transport\u000d\u000a      investments, it has long been recognised that the benefits measured by the\u000d\u000a      conventional approach, based almost exclusively on travel time savings,\u000d\u000a      are incomplete. In particular non-trivial impacts on the productivity of\u000d\u000a      the real economy are not evaluated because these were considered elusive\u000d\u000a      and beyond the scope of existing empirical models. This represents a\u000d\u000a      substantial gap in knowledge because economic impacts typically form a\u000d\u000a      principal consideration in transport investment decisions.\u000d\u000a    This gap in knowledge provided the impetus for research into the Wider\u000d\u000a      Economic Impacts (WEIs) of transport investments. Statistical estimation\u000d\u000a      of the economic effects of transport infrastructure is challenging because\u000d\u000a      experimental evidence is not available and investments are typically not\u000d\u000a      assigned randomly. Consequently, simple comparisons of average outcomes\u000d\u000a      between groups that received investment and groups that did not, will not\u000d\u000a      in general reveal a causal treatment effect. Instead, a detailed modelling\u000d\u000a      framework has to be established which can adjust for differences between\u000d\u000a      groups in estimating robust treatment effects. Furthermore, the framework\u000d\u000a      has to be capable of allowing meaningful comparison across multiple types\u000d\u000a      of investment of different scales and purposes.\u000d\u000a    Research led by Professor Dan Graham between 2005 and 2013 developed a\u000d\u000a      series of models to provide empirical evidence on the impact of changes in\u000d\u000a      accessibility on economic productivity and growth.

The\u000a      contents of these codes is typically controlled by a committee of experts\u000a      and informed by researchers. Members of the Structures Section at Imperial\u000a      have had long standing involvements in such committees. For example,\u000a      Professor Nethercot was Chair of the BSI (British Standards Institute)\u000a      Committee responsible for BS 5950 and the UK input into Eurocode 3,\u000a      Professor Elghazouli is the UK National Delegate of the International and\u000a      European Associations of Earthquake Engineering and Professor Gardner is a\u000a      member of the BSI Committee response for steel structures, the UK National\u000a      Delegate for the steel and stainless steel Eurocodes, and Chair of the UK\u000a      Mirror Group for the steel Eurocode. Owing to their widespread use,\u000a      structural design codes represent the primary means of enabling research\u000a      to impact on practice. Recent years have seen the introduction or major\u000a      revision of a number of international stainless steel design standards\u000a      underpinned by the establishment of a broad experimental database [F], and\u000a      substantial increases in the use of stainless steel in construction [H,I].\u000a      In this case study, it is explained how research conducted at Imperial has\u000a      made the most substantial contributions [A] to many of the recent\u000a      developments, particularly in relation to the UK, Europe and North\u000a      America, though Imperial research has also featured prominently in the\u000a      development of the upcoming Chinese design standard for stainless steel\u000a      [A]. The key impacts are summarised below:\u000a    UK and European design practice\u000a    Based directly on research at Imperial College, a range of improvements\u000a      have been made to key stainless steel design documents:\u000a    \u000a      In the UK National Annex [B] to the stainless steel Eurocode,\u000a        published in 2009, Imperial research has enabled strength enhancements\u000a        that arise during the manufacture of cold-formed sections to be\u000a        harnessed and utilised in design, leading to more efficient structural\u000a        solutions. The method is given in Section NA.3 of the National Annex and\u000a        is based on research reported in [5]. The method first considers the\u000a        plastic deformation that is induced during section forming, which\u000a        relates primarily to the geometry of the formed section, and then the\u000a        potential for strength enhancement of the material, which relates to the\u000a        ratio of ultimate to yield strength of the unformed sheet. The outcome\u000a        from the method is an enhanced yield strength that can be used in\u000a        subsequent design calculations. The level of enhancement therefore\u000a        depends upon the properties of the sheet material to be formed and the\u000a        geometry of the final section, but up to two-fold strength increases can\u000a        be achieved.\u000a      The continuous strength method [4], described further below, has been\u000a        published as a UK NCCI [C] in 2013. NCCI refers to `Non-Contradictory\u000a        Complementary Information' and provides supplementary guidance to the\u000a        Eurocodes for structural engineers. The CSM is already being used in the\u000a        construction industry [G,I], with an international stainless steel\u000a        producer (Ancon Building Products) noting the resulting `step-change'\u000a        (i.e. substantial increase in design capacities of sections) in their\u000a        practice [G].\u000a      The first studies [2] to examine the structural performance of lean\u000a        duplex stainless steel were conducted at Imperial between 2009 and 2012,\u000a        and based on this work, an amendment to the stainless steel Eurocode to\u000a        cover this family of grades [D] has now been accepted by the European\u000a        code committee CEN TC250-SC3. Two other key amendments arising directly\u000a        from Imperial research, covering cross-section classification and shear\u000a        buckling, were also accepted in 2012 [A,D].\u000a    \u000a    North American design practice\u000a    A new design standard for stainless steel in North America &#8212; AISC Design\u000a      Guide 27 &#8212; Structural Stainless Steel [E] was published in 2013, prior to\u000a      which no guidance for hot-rolled or welded sections was available. The\u000a      technical basis for this document is linked closely to that of Eurocode 3,\u000a      but the opportunity to include the findings of recent research has also\u000a      been taken. Thus, the new code makes very extensive reference to the\u000a      stainless steel research conducted at Imperial and described in Section 2,\u000a      with approximately one third of the code references related to research\u000a      being made to the publications of Professor Gardner [A]. Directly based on\u000a      this research are the slenderness limits given in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 of\u000a      the code, the effective area formulae to account for local buckling given\u000a      in Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2, and the design rules specified in Section 9.3\u000a      for bolted connections [E]. A major innovation in the code is the\u000a      inclusion of Annex A &#8212; the continuous strength method, which is a new\u000a      design approach enabling the more efficient design of structural stainless\u000a      steel elements. The method was developed by Professor Gardner [3,4] and\u000a      represents a significant departure from existing practice, allowing\u000a      enhanced member capacities [G] and a more accurate and consistent\u000a      representation of observed structural behaviour.\u000a    Beneficiaries\u000a    The durability and favourable mechanical properties of stainless steel\u000a      make it an ideal material for sustainable construction. With the recent\u000a      emergence and developments of structural design codes, a growing awareness\u000a      among structural engineers and architects of its benefits and an\u000a      increasing availability of structural sections, the use of stainless steel\u000a      in construction is becoming increasingly widespread [H,I]. Clearly, the\u000a      research at Imperial [A] enables more efficient structural stainless steel\u000a      designs, bringing about cost savings [G], more widespread use of the\u000a      material [A,H,I] and a reduction in the use of resources to the benefit of\u000a      future generations. The breadth of impact throughout the stainless steel\u000a      and structural engineering communities, including producers [H], code\u000a      writers [A] and practitioners [G,I], and global reach of the research,\u000a      with extensive influence on UK, European, North American and Asian\u000a      practice [A] have been demonstrated.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    National and International design codes are the key vehicles for enabling\u000a      structural engineering research to impact on practice.

The method moves away\u000a      from traditional cross-section classification, and determines structural\u000a      resistance on the basis of a continuous relationship between slenderness\u000a      and (inelastic) local buckling and a rational exploitation of strain\u000a      hardening. By departing from the current stepwise treatment and allowing\u000a      for strain hardening, the CSM has been shown to offer increases in member\u000a      resistance of about 25% over current European Standards and a reduction in\u000a      scatter of the prediction. This represents a significant enhancement in\u000a      efficiency and provides considerable savings in construction resources\u000a      [A7].

The research\u000a      has been led by Professor Leroy Gardner and involved Professor David\u000a      Nethercot, Professor Ahmed Elghazouli, ten PhD students and numerous\u000a      undergraduate and MSc project students. The primary focus of the research\u000a      has been to develop an understanding of the behaviour of stainless steel\u000a      as a structural material through experimentation and modelling and to\u000a      generate design methods suitable for incorporation into international\u000a      design codes. The research has been funded by EPSRC, the European Union\u000a      and numerous industrial sponsors. Many of the published research papers\u000a      have featured in the most highly cited articles list in top journals. The\u000a      key underpinning research contributions may be summarised as follows:\u000a    \u000a      Rigorous experimentation has been undertaken since 2001, e.g. [1, 2],\u000a        on a range of structural stainless steel grades and section types.\u000a        Innovative testing techniques have been developed [1] and followed by\u000a        others, and Imperial has made the most substantial contribution to the\u000a        international database of structural performance data [F]. These data\u000a        have been used to underpin the development of new design rules and\u000a        methods [3-5] in international design codes and to determine their\u000a        statistical reliability.\u000a      A consistent approach to the nonlinear numerical modelling of\u000a        stainless steel structural components [6] and connections has been\u000a        established. Models have been validated against a substantial pool of\u000a        physical test results, and numerical prediction of the key performance\u000a        measures has been achieved with a high degree of accuracy. Comparisons\u000a        with tests and subsequent parametric studies have enabled the\u000a        development of universal expressions for modelling material\u000a        stress-strain behaviour, enhanced strength corner properties, initial\u000a        geometric imperfections (local and global) and residual stresses.\u000a        Confidence in the sophistication and reliability of the developed\u000a        numerical models has enabled further structural performance data to be\u000a        generated and areas to be explored beyond those considered\u000a        experimentally. Over the past eight years, the findings and proposals\u000a        have been adopted by many other researchers around the world, as\u000a        indicated for example by over 80 citations to [6].\u000a      Development of design rules for many aspects of structural stainless\u000a        steel design, including cross-section classification, member buckling,\u000a        new section types (oval hollow sections), the capturing of cold-work\u000a        strength enhancements during forming, new grades of material (lean\u000a        duplex stainless steel) and connections. Furthermore, a new design\u000a        philosophy for stainless steel structures that recognises the particular\u000a        nature of the material stress-strain response, has been devised. This\u000a        approach, termed the continuous strength method (CSM), is based\u000a        initially on deformation rather than strength and represents a radical\u000a        departure from current practice. The CSM was established at Imperial and\u000a        has been the topic of two prize winning papers published in 2004 and\u000a        2008 [3,4] and numerous keynote addresses at International Conferences.\u000a        The approach offers substantial increases in load carrying capacities\u000a        (up to 25%) over existing design methods, is included in UK and North\u000a        American design guidance for stainless steel (see [A,C and E]) and has\u000a        been used in practice to achieve more efficient designs [G].\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42346","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society","Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Process from research to impact: The vehicle for policy change has\u000a      been Shipton's membership of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of\u000a      Engineering working group on Shale gas extraction in the UK (Feb 2012 to\u000a      present) and Lunn's membership of the UK Government Committee for\u000a      Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) (2008-present).\u000a    The UK Government's Chief Scientific Adviser asked the Royal Society and\u000a      the Royal Academy of Engineering to carry out an \"independent review of\u000a      the scientific and engineering evidence relating to the technical aspects\u000a      of the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing\" to inform UK government\u000a      on shale gas extraction. Prof Shipton was recommended for the joint\u000a      academies working group by Prof Boulton, the leader of the Royal Society's\u000a      policy advice group, based predominantly on research track-record [Source\u000a      A]. The working group terms of reference were: What are the major risks\u000a      associated with hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract shale gas in\u000a      the UK, including geological risks, such as seismicity, and environmental\u000a      risks, such as groundwater contamination? Can these risks be effectively\u000a      managed? If so, how? The working group first met to review the scientific\u000a      and engineering evidence in February 2012 and their report, Shale gas\u000a        extraction in the UK: a review of hydraulic fracturing, published in\u000a      June 2012 [Source B], includes explicit recommendations originating from\u000a      Lunn and Shipton's research, addressing (a) the need for careful site\u000a      characterisation (ref. 1), (b) data pooling (refs. 2 and 3), (c) the need\u000a      for detailed in situ stress characterisation (refs. 5 and 6), and\u000a      (d) microseismic monitoring (ref. 4). The report was launched at a media\u000a      briefing and Prof Shipton (one of 4 working group members to act as media\u000a      representatives) was quoted extensively in the national press, Radio 4 and\u000a      the World Service. Shipton has since participated in other media events\u000a      and a briefing for MPs at the House of Commons (July 2013). The working\u000a      group continue to be consulted nationally and internationally (e.g.\u000a      Chinese delegation to the UK in July). The working group were invited to\u000a      meet with DECC on 14\/6\/13, where Shipton presented a policy brief on\u000a      \"Reducing geological uncertainties related to fracking\". Shipton led a\u000a      workshop for Scottish Government Energy Team (May 2012) on unconventional\u000a      gas, presenting results of the Joint Academies report and the reasons for\u000a      the large variation in estimates in UK and global reserves (geological\u000a      uncertainty being a big factor). As a result of this workshop the Energy\u000a      Team convened a Scottish Government Expert Scientific Group on\u000a      Unconventional Oil and Gas in June 2013, of which Shipton is now a member.\u000a      Shipton was also an expert reviewer of the New Zealand Government's\u000a      guidelines on Guidelines on Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities\u000a      for Oil and Gas Development (July 2013).\u000a    Types of Impact: The immediate benefit of the research is on the\u000a      UK government in terms of regulations and policies relating to exploration\u000a      for shale gas and to the disposal of radioactive waste. The longer term\u000a      impact will be on the UK public in terms of energy supply\/security, and to\u000a      energy companies.\u000a    Lifting the fracking embargo &#8212; new policy and regulations.\u000a      In December 2012, the Energy and Climate Change Secretary announced that,\u000a      after reviewing the evidence in the report, exploratory drilling for shale\u000a      gas could resume in the UK, subject to new controls to mitigate the risks\u000a      of seismic activity [Sources C and D]. In July 2013, DECC published the\u000a      guidance document \"About shale gas and hydraulic fracturing (fracking)\"\u000a      [Source E]. To gain a frack consent, DECC now requires operators to\u000a      develop a Hydraulic Fracturing Programme (HFP), a detailed risk assessment\u000a      describing the \"control and mitigation measures for fracture containment\u000a      and for any potential induced seismicity\". An HFP requires operators to\u000a      conduct detailed geological modelling to delineate any faults in the area\u000a      of a well to be fracked, characterise the local stress fields, and monitor\u000a      for small seismic events on those (or any unidentified) faults.\u000a      \"Guidelines for UK Well Operators on Onshore Shale Gas Wells\" [Source F]\u000a      published by the newly formed UK Onshore Operators Group contains details\u000a      of the HFP and emphasises that \"Operators should not overlook the\u000a      potential presence of faults that cannot be detected given the limits of\u000a      seismic reflection surveys.\" The UK is the only country so far to have\u000a      plans to regulate induced seismicity. The EU is currently looking into\u000a      shale gas regulation, with the UK's approach considered best practice.\u000a    Economic impact &#8212; gas exploration. Multi-&#163;M investment,\u000a      investigation and development of fracking for shale gas in the UK was only\u000a      made possible by the lifting of the embargo arising, in part, from the\u000a      Strathclyde research. Since the lifting of the embargo in 2012, UK shale\u000a      gas exploration has resumed, with \"around 10 companies at\u000a      present...looking at drilling 20 to 40 wells before 2015\" (Ken Cronin,\u000a      UKOOG chief executive, 2\/5\/13). This exploratory drilling is essential for\u000a      operators to make informed licence applications to UK's 14th\u000a      onshore licencing round in 2014. Lord Browne, Chairman of Cuadrilla told\u000a      the Guardian (12\/3\/13) that his company intended to invest billions of\u000a      pounds over 10 years in UK shale gas. Duarte Figuera, the head of the\u000a      newly formed DECC Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil has suggested that\u000a      several &#163;100M will be spent by operators in the UK 14th round\u000a      even if no reserves are proved (ESGOS conference, 20\/9\/2013).\u000a    Benefits to the consumer. Although the plummeting gas price seen\u000a      in the US is unlikely to be replicated in the UK due to differences in the\u000a      mineral rights and licencing regulations, there are significant energy\u000a      security benefits to the UK in prolonging its supply of indigenous gas. A\u000a      report by the Institute of Directors said that shale gas could supply up\u000a      to 1\/3 of peak gas by 2030, could lower net imports by &#163;8Bn, bring in an\u000a      investment of &#163;3.7Bn and support over 70,000 jobs. Shale gas is a labour\u000a      intensive industry and requires jobs across the supply chain, therefore UK\u000a      shale gas extraction will impact contractors, and create local jobs. The\u000a      Energy and Climate Change Committee has said \"While it is difficult to say\u000a      with any accuracy how many jobs a successful UK shale gas industry would\u000a      create, estimates range from the thousands to the tens of thousands\"\u000a      [Source G].\u000a    Public debate and understanding. Publication of the Joint\u000a      Academies report, and subsequent media coverage, has stimulated public\u000a      debate and has helped to allay public fears about the risk of seismicity.\u000a      There has been a key shift in the in focus of the \"anti\" debate away from\u000a      earthquake risk and water contamination towards the climate change risks\u000a      (e.g. interview with Caroline Lucas MP Radio 4 Today Programme 20\/8\/13):\u000a      this represents a real result for evidence-based policy. Lifting the\u000a      fracking embargo has sent a positive message globally about the relative\u000a      magnitudes of risks associated with shale gas.\u000a    UK radioactive waste disposal &#8212; policy change. The same underlying\u000a      research that informed and generated shale gas policy has resulted in\u000a      substantial changes to the siting policy for UK radioactive waste\u000a      disposal. Policy change has been influenced through Prof Lunn's membership\u000a      of the UK Government Committee for Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM)\u000a      (2008-present) [source H]. CoRWM provides independent scrutiny and advice\u000a      to Ministers on radioactive waste management and disposal. Development of\u000a      a new policy began in February 2013, as a consequence of West Cumbria\u000a      withdrawing from the previous siting process. CoRWM's policy advice\u000a      (16\/4\/2013), the geological aspects of which were led by Prof Lunn, has\u000a      resulted in a new approach to consideration of geological uncertainty;\u000a      geological information will be considered earlier and uncertainty will be\u000a      presented explicitly [Source I]. This will increase the chances of\u000a      successfully siting a UK geological disposal facility (GDF) for higher\u000a      activity radioactive waste; a policy outcome to which the UK government is\u000a      committed (Managing Radioactive Waste Safely White Paper) and without\u000a      which, planning permission cannot be granted for new-build nuclear power.\u000a      Greenpeace lodged an application for judicial review of the new nuclear\u000a      reactor at Hinkley Point C in May 2012, on the premise that planning\u000a      permission should not have been granted without having a credible policy\u000a      in place for dealing with radioactive waste. If successful, this\u000a      application would have halted the UK's entire Nuclear New Build Programme.\u000a      Greenpeace eventually withdrew their application on 27\/10\/13, because the\u000a      launch of the Government's proposed new siting process provided a credible\u000a      way forward for dealing with nuclear waste [Source J].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research into the quantification and reduction of geological uncertainty\u000a      has directly resulted in changes to UK government policy relating to the\u000a      subsurface as a geological resource.

Engineering the fracking\u000a      process requires tens of so-called \"frack jobs\" in each well to access as\u000a      large a surface area within the rock volume as possible while minimising\u000a      environmental impacts. Two concerns commonly raised are 1) inducing\u000a      seismicity large enough to be felt at the surface and 2) opening new\u000a      pathways out of the target formation that might allow gas and\/or\u000a      contaminated water into aquifers, or to the surface. The first onshore\u000a      fracking for shale gas in the UK occurred in April 2011. Ten hours after\u000a      two of five \"frack jobs\", two magnitude 2 tremors were felt by the local\u000a      population. Subsequent investigations by the operator (Cuadrilla) and the\u000a      British Geological Survey showed slip had occurred on a fault zone passing\u000a      close to the well, which had not been identified by site investigation\u000a      prior to drilling. Although seismicity was two orders of magnitude smaller\u000a      than that regularly felt near old coalfields, public outcry resulted in\u000a      DECC imposing an embargo on fracking for shale gas in the UK.\u000a    Earthquakes (of any size) occur by slip on a rupture patch, creating new\u000a      fractures, or more commonly, reopening previously sealed existing\u000a      geological features (a fault zone, mineral vein, or material contrast\u000a      between rock types). The size of a pre-existing fault places an upper\u000a      limit on the magnitude of an earthquake on that fault. High-pressure\u000a      injection during fracking alters the effective stress around the borehole,\u000a      bringing pre-existing planes of weakness closer to failure. To\u000a      characterise the risk posed by fracking, an operator must know the\u000a      location, size and orientation of any likely weaknesses, and the current\u000a      in-situ stress state (how close weaknesses are to slipping). It is,\u000a      therefore, desirable to: 1) Develop a geological model (e.g. from existing\u000a      map data and legacy 2D seismic data) to constrain the geometry of features\u000a      at depth, as well as their likely evolution (stress history) to enable\u000a      prediction of small-scale features; 2) Collect 3D seismic data (a 3D image\u000a      of subsurface features with ~10 m vertical resolution); 3) Drill\u000a      exploratory boreholes, which are a complete record of the rocks along a 1D\u000a      transect, and which are one source of data on in-situ stress; 4) Collect\u000a      \"background\" seismic activity (generally only for magnitudes over +2),\u000a      providing data on the current stress state and locations of large\u000a      features. Ideally an operator would collect data from each of these\u000a      sources and check that they were consistent. In practice, some or all of\u000a      these steps are often omitted by industry even in conventional hydrocarbon\u000a      settings.\u000a    Key Research findings: Collaborative research into characterising\u000a      geological uncertainty by Shipton and Lunn has demonstrated that:\u000a    \u000a      Geological data are inherently under-constrained and are, therefore\u000a        inherently equivocal: multiple geological models can honour a given set\u000a        of geological data. The researchers showed for the first time that it is\u000a        possible to develop workflow protocols to improve the quality of\u000a        geological interpretation and the quantification of the associated\u000a        uncertainties [1]. From a dataset of 184 academic and industry experts,\u000a        only 29% were able to pick the correct interpretation of a 3D seismic\u000a        image. Only 18 of the experts validated their interpretation by checking\u000a        geometric and evolutionary feasibility, 94% of the 18 experts chose the\u000a        correct interpretation and the remainder knew that they were wrong.\u000a        The research showed that there are key steps that interpreters can make\u000a        to develop more robust subsurface geological models.\u000a      Reactivation and propagation of fractures is highly dependent on local\u000a        stresses, and especially their temporal evolution [5, 6]. In fracking\u000a        there will be very strong dynamic stress changes local to the boreholes\u000a        as successive \"frack jobs\" take place. The results of this research\u000a        suggest that careful characterization of baseline stress prior to each\u000a        frack job will result in a better outcome (though these papers do not\u000a        explicitly address shale gas).\u000a      The heterogeneity of fault\/fracture systems [2] means data pooling\u000a        from multiple sites is required to quantify fault structural geological\u000a        uncertainty [3]. Data from multiple sites can bound uncertainty in bulk\u000a        fault parameters, such as fault length and thickness (fault thickness\u000a        can be determined from borehole data; fault length, which is directly\u000a        related to the maximum magnitude of an earthquake that a given fault can\u000a        host, cannot). This is a key example of the kind of open-source data\u000a        pooling that will be necessary to provide the best and safest outcomes\u000a        in a developing on-shore shale gas industry in the UK.\u000a      Microseismic events (magnitudes down to minus 2) can be triggered by\u000a        exceptionally small changes in pressure and so can be used as a tool for\u000a        mapping the hydraulically conductive fractures in a rock volume, thus\u000a        reducing structural uncertainty as well as providing information on the\u000a        flow properties of the conductive fractures [4]. This research shows\u000a        novel geophysical tools that can be used to constrain the geometry and\u000a        properties of features previously considered to be below resolution of\u000a        3D seismic techniques, thereby increasing the level of certainty in site\u000a        investigations and providing data for the most effective engineering of\u000a        multiple frack jobs.\u000a    \u000a    Key Researchers at Strathclyde: R Lunn joined the Dept. of Civil\u000a      Engineering in 2005 (Senior Lecturer; Reader 2008-2010; Professor 2010); Z\u000a      Shipton was appointed as Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering\u000a      in 2010; S Pytharouli joined the department in 2007 as a PDRA to Prof\u000a      Lunn, and was appointed Lecturer in 2009.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42347","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Process\/Events from Research to Impact:\u000d\u000a    The original research team developing STAR consisted of Dr Switzer (lead\u000d\u000a      experimental PDRA) and Dr Rein (computational PDRA) at the University of\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh under the direction of Dr Gerhard (PI), Prof Torero (Co-I). All\u000d\u000a      researchers moved to other institutions beginning with Dr Gerhard's\u000d\u000a      departure to University of Western Ontario in 2007. Dr Switzer, Dr\u000d\u000a      Gerhard, and Prof. Torero agreed research licences with the University of\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh to continue research on STAR. In 2009, Dr Switzer joined the\u000d\u000a      University of Strathclyde and continued her research to develop the\u000d\u000a      engineered system. This was first achieved at 3m3 scale [4] and\u000d\u000a      then during in situ and ex situ field studies [Source B].\u000d\u000a      After 2009 Dr Switzer supervised Ph.D researchers with Prof. Tarantino\u000d\u000a      focussing on scale-up of the STAR process (Robson) and geotechnical and\u000d\u000a      geochemical properties of the resulting soils (Zihms), which industrial\u000d\u000a      site owners and other clients have said are key issues.\u000d\u000a    Smouldering remediation technology is delivered commercially as\u000d\u000a      Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation (STAR) by SiREM, a\u000d\u000a      division of Geosyntec Consultants, Inc., which is a multi-national\u000d\u000a      environmental consultancy that employs 1000+ individuals [Source A]. SiREM\u000d\u000a      was founded in 2002 with the mission of bringing to market unique,\u000d\u000a      science-based products and solutions in support of groundwater\u000d\u000a      remediation.\u000d\u000a    Types of Impact from the adoption of new technology:\u000d\u000a    Economic benefits: In 2010, STAR was officially launched within\u000d\u000a      SiREM as a side project of one Geosyntec employee. In 2012, the first full\u000d\u000a      time STAR employees were appointed. Since that time, STAR has grown to be\u000d\u000a      a department (January 2013) with 5 employees working full time and varying\u000d\u000a      numbers of other employees part time as needed on STAR projects. [text\u000d\u000a      removed for publication] SiREM has formed strategic partnerships with two\u000d\u000a      large, international Fortune 500 companies (who have asked not to be\u000d\u000a      named). Stage 1 remediations with STAR have been carried out on\u000d\u000a      contaminated materials from the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. STAR\u000d\u000a      projects have been highly profitable for Geosyntec, given them access to\u000d\u000a      new clients, and increased revenue to other parts of the company [Source\u000d\u000a      A].\u000d\u000a    A major international manufacturing company commissioned the first in\u000d\u000a      situ Stage 1 implementation of STAR at the site of a former creosol\u000d\u000a      manufacturing facility in the USA in 2009. Dr Switzer provided extensive\u000d\u000a      consultancy support during all stages of the remediation, including advice\u000d\u000a      on planning and design of initial tests; experimentation at Strathclyde to\u000d\u000a      develop the ignition protocol for in situ ignition; on site support during\u000d\u000a      initial tests; monitoring and data analysis during the tests; and further\u000d\u000a      analysis and interpretation after the tests [Source C]. During her time on\u000d\u000a      site and afterwards, Dr Switzer trained SiREM personnel how to run STAR\u000d\u000a      and interpret field data. Based on the success of these initial tests, the\u000d\u000a      client commissioned the design of the full Stage 2 system for\u000d\u000a      implementation in 2014 to enable redevelopment of the site in 2016. [text\u000d\u000a      removed for publication] This client demonstrated their commitment to\u000d\u000a      implementing STAR by terminating the lease with the existing site tenant\u000d\u000a      (waiving additional income) and clearing the site for remediation. The\u000d\u000a      Stage 1 remediation was published as a Project Spotlight [Source D] and\u000d\u000a      has been presented at major remediation conferences around the world since\u000d\u000a      2010.\u000d\u000a    SiREM agreed a second strategic partnership with a Fortune 500 oil and\u000d\u000a      gas company to commission a prototype ex situ reactor and a series of\u000d\u000a      tests on its waste materials [text removed for publication] which it paid\u000d\u000a      to ship from Australia to Canada. The design of this reactor was directly\u000d\u000a      influenced by research [Refs 1,2,4]. Dr Switzer provided consultancy in\u000d\u000a      the form of guidance during the design of the reactor, planning of initial\u000d\u000a      tests, and interpretation of data after the tests.\u000d\u000a    Environmental impacts: STAR provides significant environmental\u000d\u000a      improvements to sites contaminated with heavy hydrocarbons. In both of the\u000d\u000a      cases outlined previously, STAR was the only viable option for\u000d\u000a      remediation. STAR destroys 99.9+% of contaminant mass in place in the soil\u000d\u000a      whereas competing technologies recover some of this mass and require its\u000d\u000a      disposal as hazardous waste. STAR returns visibly cleaned soil that is\u000d\u000a      suitable for reuse [Reference 3 and Source A]. Sustainability analysis by\u000d\u000a      SiREM in year, for the client who commissioned the first in situ Stage 1\u000d\u000a      test of STAR, showed that remediation with STAR provided significant\u000d\u000a      reduction in lifecycle carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions relative to their\u000d\u000a      expensive dig and dump alternative because STAR generated most of its own\u000d\u000a      energy for remediation. Analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in tonnes of\u000d\u000a      equivalent CO2 emissions (eCO2) showed STAR would emit less\u000d\u000a      than 10% of other potential remediation approaches: 4,400 eCO2\u000d\u000a      from STAR compared to 41,000 eCO2 for low temperature thermal desorption\u000d\u000a      and 46,000 for excavation and disposal. This analysis, which was based on\u000d\u000a      the Stage 1 remediation supported by Switzer, created further value to the\u000d\u000a      client who wanted to maintain their corporate reputation for\u000d\u000a      sustainability alongside their commitment to remediate the site.\u000d\u000a    Practitioners and Professional Services: Dr Switzer tested field\u000d\u000a      hardware (2009) and provided field trial support on site (2009-11),\u000d\u000a      directly supporting field operations, interpreting critical process data,\u000d\u000a      and effectively training SiREM employees on the job for in situ and ex\u000d\u000a      situ Stage 1 tests. She provided further support remotely through\u000d\u000a      conference calls, emails, and file sharing (monthly or more frequent\u000d\u000a      engagement, (2009-present). Her interpretations were based on experience\u000d\u000a      gained during the research, particularly scale-up and emissions\u000d\u000a      interpretation [1,4]. The United States Environmental Protection Agency\u000d\u000a      (USEPA) began including STAR in their training materials for remediation\u000d\u000a      practitioners in 2012 [Source E]. USEPA is the main environmental\u000d\u000a      regulator in the USA and the precedents that it sets have global\u000d\u000a      implications for the uptake of STAR technology, as it meets these widely\u000d\u000a      accepted standards. USEPA has conducted independent evaluations\u000d\u000a      (2012-2013) of the technology and continues to advocate for STAR to USEPA\u000d\u000a      project managers [Source A].\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance:\u000d\u000a    SiREM and Geosyntec [text removed for publication] benefitted from the\u000d\u000a      development of highly-skilled employees, and increased the potential to\u000d\u000a      gain access to new sites and commercial clients. SiREM's clients are\u000d\u000a      supporting the development of STAR because they see benefits from early\u000d\u000a      access to this remediation technology, substantial cost savings, carbon\u000d\u000a      footprint reduction, and reduction of their environmental liabilities. In\u000d\u000a      many cases, STAR will be the only viable remediation option for their\u000d\u000a      contaminated soil or waste. In three years of commercial activity, SiREM\u000d\u000a      has formed strategic development partnerships with two major international\u000d\u000a      Fortune 500 companies, each with unique waste management needs. Their\u000d\u000a      investment activity has been key to demonstrate STAR in Stage 1 tests in\u000d\u000a      both in situ and ex situ settings for contamination issues\u000d\u000a      of worldwide relevance. One client has requested that Geosyntec develop a\u000d\u000a      full-scale design of in situ remediation and that the potential\u000d\u000a      application be staged to allow further evaluation of STAR to meet their\u000d\u000a      remedial objectives. The USEPA now includes STAR in its training materials\u000d\u000a      [Source E]. Further, rapid escalation of STAR is expected to follow these\u000d\u000a      significant, initial developments.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Dr Switzer since 2009 has led to scale-up and\u000d\u000a      commercialisation of a new smouldering combustion-based remediation\u000d\u000a      technology: Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation (STAR).

Simple, non-biological, easily\u000d\u000a      engineered clean-up solutions are imperative to limit environmental\u000d\u000a      liability. Historically, clean-up of soils heavily contaminated with\u000d\u000a      organic liquids, such as coal tar, has been of very limited success.\u000d\u000a      Switzer's research played a key role in the development of a treatment\u000d\u000a      process for land polluted with tar and oil, which removes a high\u000d\u000a      percentage of the contaminants.\u000d\u000a    Key Findings\u000d\u000a    The treatment process, named Self-sustaining Treatment for Active\u000d\u000a      Remediation (STAR), uses targeted smouldering combustion to destroy\u000d\u000a      organic liquid contaminants in soil and other porous materials. The heat\u000d\u000a      generated by the reaction locally supports the propagation of the\u000d\u000a      smouldering front through the remaining contaminated soil. STAR very\u000d\u000a      quickly becomes self-sustaining, which means that it can provide all of\u000d\u000a      the energy necessary to support itself, but is completely controllable by\u000d\u000a      regulating the flow of air to the process. It has achieved better than\u000d\u000a      99.9% remediation in many cases and is particularly effective on high\u000d\u000a      molecular weight hydrocarbons such as coal tar and oil wastes [2], which\u000d\u000a      are among the most difficult organic contaminants to treat. There are two\u000d\u000a      typical field deployments of STAR. Ex situ STAR treats waste\u000d\u000a      materials in a reactor [1,4]; these materials may or may not be soils and\u000d\u000a      may or may not require mixing prior to treatment. In situ STAR\u000d\u000a      involves the application of smouldering with purpose built hardware to\u000d\u000a      contaminated soils (or \"made ground\") in place. Each type of deployment\u000d\u000a      has key advantages that make it appealing for customers with specific\u000d\u000a      waste management needs. Commercial deployment of in situ\u000d\u000a      remediation processes requires a two-stage approach to field\u000d\u000a      implementation. Once a laboratory treatability study shows that a\u000d\u000a      contaminated material is well-suited to STAR, an initial field remediation\u000d\u000a      (Stage 1) is carried out to evaluate the technology in a representative\u000d\u000a      test area before proceeding to full-scale remediation (Stage 2). Because\u000d\u000a      of the complexity of applying remediation technologies in the field,\u000d\u000a      multiple in situ tests may be carried out at the Stage 1 scale\u000d\u000a      before proceeding to Stage 2. In an ex situ setting, on the\u000d\u000a      strength of Stage 1 testing already carried out, many waste materials can\u000d\u000a      proceed directly to Stage 2.\u000d\u000a    Successful progress of the STAR technology from research papers to\u000d\u000a      commercial impact has relied on a number of key findings\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      `Beaker-scale' proof of concept that organic liquids, mixed with sand,\u000d\u000a        can be converted to gases through the process of smouldering combustion\u000d\u000a        leaving less than 0.01% residual contaminant mass [2].\u000d\u000a      Development of the engineered STAR system using pilot scale studies\u000d\u000a        from lab\/column-scale through to 3m3 scale [1,2,4],\u000d\u000a      Demonstration of in situ field-scale treatment of 300m3 of\u000d\u000a        water-saturated soil in the US, that achieved a 99.7% soil contaminant\u000d\u000a        destruction, including design of the necessary emissions capture and\u000d\u000a        filtration systems on site.

The research produced a body of evidence\u000d\u000a      strong enough to elicit funding from the Scottish Government through their\u000d\u000a      International Development Fund, which allowed Drs Morse and Grimason to\u000d\u000a      set up the Scottish Chikhwawa Health Initiative (SCHI) in 2006 [Source A].\u000d\u000a      Dr Morse has been the programme manager since inception, with funding now\u000d\u000a      amounting to over &#163;0.5M (2006-2013). Working with Ministry of Health,\u000d\u000a      Chikhwawa District Health Office and the University of Malawi, SCHI\u000d\u000a      implemented a programme of interventions designed to reduce mortality and\u000d\u000a      morbidity in the target communities. This included provision of clean\u000d\u000a      water at source and household level, supporting the construction of\u000d\u000a      improved latrines, improving health facilities and access to such\u000d\u000a      facilities, training of Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) and\u000d\u000a      voluntary community members who form village health committees, and water\u000d\u000a      point committees to build capacity for sustainable change at community\u000d\u000a      level. Subsequent funding (2009 - 2013) has been used to implement\u000d\u000a      maternal health programmes using the same principles and interventions,\u000d\u000a      and has enabled expansion from the original 4 communities to over 150.\u000d\u000a    The SCHI programme approached the issue of diarrhoeal disease in a\u000d\u000a      holistic manner addressing community health education, health access,\u000d\u000a      capital investment, capacity building in government health workers and\u000d\u000a      community based volunteers, and access to effective interventions, e.g.\u000d\u000a      dose chlorination of water at household level. This combined approach\u000d\u000a      aimed to achieve sustained behaviour change. The pilot communities were\u000d\u000a      also developed as model populations, which were the basis for peer\u000d\u000a      education and dissemination for their surrounding area.\u000d\u000a    Improvement in monitoring of health and reduction in disease: An\u000d\u000a      overall reduction in diarrhoeal disease of 30% was achieved across the\u000d\u000a      target communities (ranging from 20-35% from baseline data) during the\u000d\u000a      first funding cycle (2006-09). This was due to a combination of\u000d\u000a      improvements including a 20% increase in latrine coverage, 25% increase in\u000d\u000a      improved latrine coverage, 100% increase in access to integrated\u000d\u000a      management of childhood illness (including diarrhoeal disease prevention\u000d\u000a      and treatment) at community level, 75% increase in access to growth\u000d\u000a      monitoring and immunisation programmes at community level. These\u000d\u000a      interventions were supported through capacity building of health workers\u000d\u000a      and community volunteers, as well as specific infrastructural improvements\u000d\u000a      [Sources A,B,H]. SCHI has also worked with a sister programme in Chikhwawa\u000d\u000a      on renewable energy (Community Renewable Energy Development) which has\u000d\u000a      allowed the provision of solar refrigerator units within health posts and\u000d\u000a      therefore continuous access to vaccinations integral to diarrhoeal disease\u000d\u000a      control [Source F].\u000d\u000a    Provision of training to health staff: One of the key investments\u000d\u000a      of SCHI has been capacity building among government health staff (Health\u000d\u000a      Surveillance Assistants, medical assistants, Environmental Health Officers\u000d\u000a      and nurses). Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) are resident within\u000d\u000a      communities and are responsible for community health access at health\u000d\u000a      posts and clinics, health surveillance, water and sanitation development,\u000d\u000a      and health education. Their positive impact can be utilised through\u000d\u000a      increasing numbers of and empowering HSAs with knowledge to effectively\u000d\u000a      disseminate information about disease and mechanisms of spread, and the\u000d\u000a      ability to provide basic health services at community level. SCHI provided\u000d\u000a      training on integrated management of childhood illnesses including\u000d\u000a      diarrhoeal disease, HIV testing and counselling, and growth monitoring to\u000d\u000a      all HSAs in the catchment area, 23 in total. To allow HSAs to conduct\u000d\u000a      their activities effectively requires them to be resident within their\u000d\u000a      catchment area and have access to affordable transport. SCHI has provided\u000d\u000a      20 bicycles, and 3 houses to support HSA activities, and this led to an\u000d\u000a      increase in the satisfaction level of communities in their health access\u000d\u000a      and support [Source F]; communities without an HSA have been shown to be\u000d\u000a      less knowledgeable about causes, symptoms and prevention of diarrhoeal\u000d\u000a      disease [Source C]. This training was supported by the construction and\u000d\u000a      refurbishment of 4 health posts to provide a basis for services and were\u000d\u000a      provided with solar refrigeration units and lighting. 23 bicycle\u000d\u000a      ambulances have also been provided at strategic points within the\u000d\u000a      catchment villages to enhance emergency transportation cover. Turnover of\u000d\u000a      health staff in Chikhwawa is high due to the remote location in one of the\u000d\u000a      hottest parts of the country and therefore staff retention is a key\u000d\u000a      objective; capacity building is only beneficial where staff knowledge can\u000d\u000a      be retained. To aid retention at health centre and hospital level, the\u000d\u000a      SCHI has improved infrastructure through construction of further housing\u000d\u000a      and facilities, e.g. a senior staff house, 3 nurses houses and an 18 bed\u000d\u000a      nutrition rehabilitation unit with associated offices and teaching area\u000d\u000a      [Source F].\u000d\u000a    Environmental Impacts: In relation to areas such as water and\u000d\u000a      sanitation, the SCHI has provided two new wells, repaired non-functioning\u000d\u000a      wells and upgraded 17 others. A key issue in water quality is post\u000d\u000a      collection contamination. To reduce the risk of disease transmission via\u000d\u000a      this route, chlorine can be added to household storage containers. The\u000d\u000a      programme has been involved in distributing 8748 bottles of chlorine\u000d\u000a      tables per year which treats 8.7 million litres of water. To ensure\u000d\u000a      sustainability of water sources, community committees received training on\u000d\u000a      maintenance, health education, revolving fund management and community\u000d\u000a      participation [Source F]. Through community engagement and voluntary\u000d\u000a      committees, the programme has introduced simple ecological sanitation\u000d\u000a      technologies and increased pit latrine ownership from 39% to 59%; this was\u000d\u000a      supported by health education on the need for effective hand washing.\u000d\u000a    Public Policy Impacts: Due to in-country expertise and\u000d\u000a      underpinning research, Dr Morse was invited by PATH (Program for\u000d\u000a      Appropriate Technology in Health), an International NGO, and funded\u000d\u000a      through Gates Foundation Funding, to assess current programmes and\u000d\u000a      challenges for diarrhoeal control in Malawi [Source D]. The final report\u000d\u000a      \"Towards an Integrated Approach to Diarrhoeal Disease Control in Malawi\"\u000d\u000a      [Source E] put forward recommendations on reducing diarrhoeal disease\u000d\u000a      burden in Malawi, and is now being used as the basis for the development\u000d\u000a      of a national diarrhoeal disease control policy by the Malawian\u000d\u000a      Government. Acknowledging the challenge a high burden of\u000d\u000a      preventable\/treatable disease and limited health service brings to Malawi,\u000d\u000a      the Government instigated a 5 year Health Research Capacity Strengthening\u000d\u000a      Initiative (HRCSI), co-ordinated by the National Commission for Science\u000d\u000a      and Technology (NCST), with the aim of promoting multidisciplinary health\u000d\u000a      research; one of the milestones of the HRCSI was the development of\u000d\u000a      National Health Research Agenda, a policy document setting national\u000d\u000a      research priorities for 2011-2016 [Source B]. To address national\u000d\u000a      limitations in Environmental Health provision, the NCST approached Dr\u000d\u000a      Morse to undertake a gap analysis of Environmental Health research needs,\u000d\u000a      with the goal of recommending research priorities and an effective action\u000d\u000a      plan to address the gaps; research priority areas highlighted include\u000d\u000a      water and sanitation, disease surveillance and response, health promotion\u000d\u000a      and education. The Gap Analysis (2012) has been incorporated into the\u000d\u000a      National Health Research Agenda [Source G].\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance: The SCHI was initially designed for\u000d\u000a      implementation in 4 villages, covering a population of about 5700.\u000d\u000a      Continuation of the initial programme through subsequent funding\u000d\u000a      (2009-2010, 2010-2013) resulted in implementation in over 150 communities,\u000d\u000a      covering a population of over 110,000.

It is critical for countries like Malawi to\u000d\u000a      address the issue of diarrhoeal disease if they are to achieve Millennium\u000d\u000a      Development Goal (MDG) 4, which commits to reducing child mortality by two\u000d\u000a      thirds before 2015. Understanding disease prevalence and source is\u000d\u000a      essential to allow identification of appropriate controls and\u000d\u000a      interventions aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality, and thus reducing\u000d\u000a      reliance on curative health measures which are often not available or are\u000d\u000a      accessed too late. Effective community health workers, health access and\u000d\u000a      health education are key to the control and treatment of diarrhoeal\u000d\u000a      disease. However, Malawi suffers from a weak disease surveillance system,\u000d\u000a      poorly trained community health workers and limited health access which\u000d\u000a      compound the effects of preventable diseases such as diarrhoea.\u000d\u000a    Key findings: Research undertaken at the University of Strathclyde\u000d\u000a      investigated the Environmental Health approach to diarrhoeal disease\u000d\u000a      control in Malawi using Cryptosporidium, an extremely\u000d\u000a      environmentally robust protozoan parasite, as a case study. Infection,\u000d\u000a      manifesting as severe gastroenteritis, is particularly devastating to\u000d\u000a      those with weakened immune systems, e.g. under 5s, and those\u000d\u000a      immuno-compromised through malnutrition or HIV\/AIDS. In Malawi, Cryptosporidium\u000d\u000a      is thought to be responsible for around 10% of diarrhoea cases in children\u000d\u000a      under 5, rising to 21% in the immuno-compromised population [3]. Morse and\u000d\u000a      colleagues set out to identify risk factors associated with childhood\u000d\u000a      cryptosporidiosis and environmental sources of infection in both rural and\u000d\u000a      urban environments, hospital and community settings [3,4]. In addition to\u000d\u000a      demonstrating wider species diversity in rural settings (possibly due to\u000d\u000a      increased malnutrition and exposure to infected animals), the authors\u000d\u000a      clearly demonstrated through qualitative, quantitative and observational\u000d\u000a      data a picture of faecal-oral transmission of diarrhoeal disease, not only\u000d\u000a      for Cryptosporidium, but also for other diarrhoea causing agents.\u000d\u000a      For example, in surveying around 100 homes in Chikhwawa, despite 84% of\u000d\u000a      respondents indicating that they washed their hands after defecation, 75%\u000d\u000a      had bacteria indicative of faecal contamination isolated from their hands\u000d\u000a      [4]. Immersion of hands and utensils in household stored drinking water is\u000d\u000a      a known risk factor for contamination. Therefore is was not surprising\u000d\u000a      that 76% of household stored water, utilised for all domestic aspects,\u000d\u000a      such as drinking and washing, contained faecally derived micro-\u000d\u000a      organisms[4].The authors established the need for improvements in water,\u000d\u000a      sanitation, household hygiene and animal control to reduce the incidence\u000d\u000a      of infection in this population. Confirmation of Cryptosporidiosis is only\u000d\u000a      possible through laboratory investigation, and as there is no effective,\u000d\u000a      specific treatment or immunisation, an Environmental Health approach,\u000d\u000a      targeting all diarrhoeal diseases, is essential to reducing prevalence and\u000d\u000a      mortality. Therefore subsequent research, based in the rural district of\u000d\u000a      Chikhwawa, aimed at reducing the diarrhoeal disease burden, had a wider\u000d\u000a      remit to encompass all sources of infection [2, 5]. Factors identified by\u000d\u000a      the research, affecting prevalence, included low-quality water sources,\u000d\u000a      water hygiene particularly after collection, poor sanitation, poor\u000d\u000a      personal hygiene practices, unsustainably high population density, and\u000d\u000a      poor hygiene practices associated with food handling [3,5,6]. Grimason et\u000d\u000a      al, and Masangwi et al also demonstrated that despite both rural and urban\u000d\u000a      populations showing knowledge of the links between hygiene and disease\u000d\u000a      prevention, discrepancies exist between knowledge and actual practice\u000d\u000a      [2,6]. As such, the research determined that addressing diarrhoeal disease\u000d\u000a      control and treatment required an integrated and multidisciplinary\u000d\u000a      approach to health education and support to affect sustainable change.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers at University of Strathclyde: Dr Tracy Morse,\u000d\u000a      Research Fellow, SCHI Project Manager 2006-present, Dept. of Civil and\u000d\u000a      Environmental Engineering; Dr Anthony Grimason, Senior Lecturer Dept. of\u000d\u000a      Civil and Environmental Engineering 1994-2009, now Professor in\u000d\u000a      Environmental Health, University of Malawi 2010-2013.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42577","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2589581","Name":"Algeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2088628","Name":"Papua New Guinea"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research enabled us to optimise the porous structure and mechanical\u000a      properties for several\u000a      types of acoustic materials produced from industrial waste, which would\u000a      otherwise have been\u000a      destined for landfill. We were able to enhance the acoustic absorption and\u000a      vibration damping\u000a      performance of these products and to maintain quality and reproducibility\u000a      of the scaled-up\u000a      manufacturing process.\u000a    To commercialise this technology, the University of Bradford set up a\u000a      spin-off company, Acoutech\u000a      Ltd, in 2000 and started scaling up the technology (a). In 2003, the\u000a      technology was licenced to\u000a      Armacell (b), which in 2004 started manufacturing a range of products in\u000a      Europe, the Far East and\u000a      the USA under the brand name ArmaSound. It is estimated that the\u000a      production of this product\u000a      created directly at least 20 full-time engineering and manufacturing jobs\u000a      worldwide, including 4 in\u000a      the UK. Originally a slow starter, ArmaSound soon began to\u000a      demonstrate its capability as a\u000a      material unlike any other, offering acoustic benefits that were difficult\u000a      to replicate with conventional\u000a      acoustic insulation.\u000a    Early projects included acoustic linings for heavy vehicles and equipment\u000a      as well as\u000a      telecommunications cabinets and domestic boilers. Later on, it found its\u000a      way into linings for\u000a      canopies and enclosures used for housing industrial scale generators and\u000a      compressors. The jewel\u000a      in the crown, however, was when ArmaSound was approved for use in\u000a      an acoustic system\u000a      designed to reduce noise from process pipe-work including very large bore\u000a      pipes. This product has\u000a      enabled the design of a compact vibro-acoustic insulation system which\u000a      reduces the noise levels\u000a      emitted by petrochemical equipment and machines below the 75 and 80 dB\u000a      noise limits\u000a      recommended by the UK national and much international noise control\u000a      legislation. More\u000a      specifically, the availability of this range of products has led to a\u000a      shift in the conventional way in\u000a      which large pipes at petrochemical plants and offshore platforms are\u000a      treated for noise, and\u000a      ArmaSound has been specified on many prestigious petrochemical\u000a      project sites around the world.\u000a      Following success within the ammonia and ethylene segments, ArmaSound\u000a      achieved approval for\u000a      use on Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) facilities in 2010. These included the\u000a      Skikda `Mega Train' LNG\u000a      facility with Sonatrach in Algeria and PNG LNG facility with Exxon Mobil\u000a      in Papua New Guinea.\u000a    Sales of ArmaSound in 2012 were around &#8364;4M, (growing from around\u000a      &#8364;3M in 2011). Despite hard\u000a      economic times, especially for manufacturing industries, ArmaSound\u000a      bucked the trend by\u000a      continuing to grow year on year. In early 2012 Armacell were awarded a\u000a      contract to supply\u000a      ArmaSound to the Gorgon LNG project operated by Chevron\/Shell, a\u000a      $45 billion facility to be\u000a      constructed on Barrow Island, off the coast of Western Australia (b). The\u000a      value of ArmaSound\u000a      insulation in this project is estimated at US$23M. This facility is the\u000a      largest ever constructed and\u000a      will utilise ArmaSound to treat around 200km of pipe-work. ArmaSound\u000a      will experience its largest\u000a      growth period to date during 2013.\u000a    The accessible pipework insulation material market is estimated to be\u000a      &#8364;200m\/annum. ArmaSound\u000a      system market penetration is estimated at 5% or &#8364;10m\/annum in terms of the\u000a      insulation systems in\u000a      which this product is specified. Before licencing our technology, the\u000a      company was not active in this\u000a      market at all, so our technology has enabled the company to enter an\u000a      entirely new and lucrative\u000a      market. Armacell's clients now include Foam Techniques (c) (one of the\u000a      world's largest insulation\u000a      contractors), Baxi Potterton, Durabella, and Sterling Generators.\u000a      Companies who specify this\u000a      product include BP, Amec, and KBR (d).\u000a    ArmaSound products have not only generated revenue for Armacell\u000a      (e,f,g,h,i), but have also had a\u000a      significant environmental impact in three ways: firstly the acoustic\u000a      quality of spaces has been\u000a      improved through the introduction of a new product with better acoustic\u000a      properties and durability;\u000a      secondly as the product is at least half the thickness of conventional\u000a      sound-proofing material and\u000a      95% of it is recycled waste, it provides more environmental benefits than\u000a      other more conventional\u000a      products which are made from virgin materials; thirdly the company has\u000a      significantly reduced its\u000a      industrial waste.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Bradford research has enabled a material manufacturing\u000a      company, Armacell, to reuse\u000a      up to 95% of its production waste to produce new, high-value acoustic\u000a      products with up to 50%\u000a      better acoustic performance than any competition products of similar size.\u000a      We protected the\u000a      developed IP through several international patents and set up a spin-off\u000a      company, Acoutechs Ltd,\u000a      to explore this technology commercially.

This was mainly\u000a      EPSRC-sponsored research\u000a      work (EPSRC GR\/L54905\/01 and QUOTA REF. 96304127) to advance existing\u000a      analytical and\u000a      computationally based numerical models for the acoustic and mechanical\u000a      properties of porous\u000a      elastic media.\u000a    This provided the theoretical base to design \"acoustically thin\" porous\u000a      flexible panels applied to\u000a      vibro-acoustic noise reduction. The original idea proposed by Kirill\u000a      Horoshenkov (PDRA 1993-\u000a      1995, Lecturer 1995-2002, Senior Lecturer 2002-2004, Professor 2004-2013)\u000a      and David Hothersall\u000a      (Reader 1993-2000, Professor 2000-2011) was that visco-thermal absorption\u000a      could be enhanced\u000a      by the vibrations of a poro-elastic plate. The viscosity correction\u000a      function, which accounts for these\u000a      effects in the equation of motion for poro-elastic plate, has poles that\u000a      relate to the frequencies at\u000a      which the relaxation process are particularly pronounced. Suitable\u000a      expressions for this function\u000a      were derived rigorously and accurately approximated to allow for the\u000a      efficient calculations (1).\u000a    The work studied two different mechanisms which can be used to excite\u000a      vibration in a thin poro-\u000a      elastic plate: (i) the differential pressure that is applied to the solid\u000a      surface of the elastic frame (2);\u000a      (ii) the friction forces that are developed inside the porous frame so\u000a      that the frame is dragged as\u000a      the filling fluid oscillates (3). These effects were investigated for\u000a      porous elastic plates via\u000a      modifications of the original Biot and standing waves theories for thin\u000a      porous plates.\u000a      New experimental facilities were constructed in the Acoustics Laboratory\u000a      at the University of\u000a      Bradford to measure the visco-thermal acoustic absorption and vibration\u000a      damping phenomena to\u000a      validate the developed theoretical models. These included a new flow\u000a      resistivity, pore size\u000a      distribution, porosimetery (4), and transmission loss rigs. A unique,\u000a      large impedance tube facility at\u000a      Fukuoka University (Japan) was used to illustrate the apparent enhancement\u000a      in the acoustic\u000a      absorption associated with the frame vibration effects.\u000a    The derived theoretical models and experimental facilities paved the way\u000a      for the design and\u000a      manufacture of materials with enhanced acoustic absorption and vibration\u000a      damping properties.\u000a      This work was sponsored through an EPSRC studentship award.\u000a    Many material specimens have been manufactured and characterised in the\u000a      Acoustics Laboratory.\u000a      The acoustical properties of these media were predicted using the values\u000a      of the non-acoustical\u000a      material parameters, which were measured independently using the developed\u000a      laboratory setup\u000a      (5,6). This work led to the design of a thin, poro-elastic material with\u000a      commonly required vibro-\u000a      acoustic performance that could be achieved with a layer which was 2 to\u000a      3-fold thinner than any\u000a      commercial acoustic product available at that time. The production process\u000a      was designed to be a\u000a      sustainable technology based on the reuse of industrial polymeric waste.\u000a      This process was\u000a      patented in the UK in 2000, in the USA in 2001 and Europe-wide in 2003.\u000a      This process was scaled\u000a      up using a DTI SMART award and industrial funding provided by Armacell UK\u000a      Ltd.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43581","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact from the research has been achieved through three main channels:\u000d\u000a      i) incorporation of our\u000d\u000a      research outputs into internationally-used models (HARMONOISE, NORD 2000),\u000d\u000a      ii) software\u000d\u000a      packages derived from our research, and iii) adoption in national policy\u000d\u000a      requirements. Our research\u000d\u000a      outputs are now used worldwide in mapping and impact assessment of rail,\u000d\u000a      road, and wind\u000d\u000a      turbines noise with results used to plan the design and positioning of\u000d\u000a      NRDs. The targeting of\u000d\u000a      appropriately designed NRDs is a key application of our research findings,\u000d\u000a      resulting in a reduction\u000d\u000a      of the negative impact of noise on human health and associated improvement\u000d\u000a      in quality of life\u000d\u000a      through diminished noise pollution as indicated by World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation guidelines for\u000d\u000a      acceptable noise exposure (a).\u000d\u000a    i) Internationally-used sound assessment models: our research was\u000d\u000a      core to the development of\u000d\u000a      both the HARMONOISE and NORD2000 models (b,c). The HARMONOISE noise\u000d\u000a      propagation\u000d\u000a      model (d) has gained acceptance in Europe for the basis of noise mapping\u000d\u000a      (e,f) and is being\u000d\u000a      adopted in other countries, for example in predicting noise from\u000d\u000a      industrial sources in Australia (g).\u000d\u000a    The importance of our research for the development of the NORD2000 model\u000d\u000a      is described by one\u000d\u000a      of the developers thus: \"The introduction of Fresnel-zones in NORD2000\u000d\u000a        led to essential\u000d\u000a        improvement compared to earlier methods. The ground effect, for example,\u000d\u000a        is calculated for each\u000d\u000a        type of ground to be found inside the Fresnel-zone and the resulting\u000d\u000a        ground effect is calculated as\u000d\u000a        a weighted average taking into account the fraction of the Fresnel-zone\u000d\u000a        covered by each type of\u000d\u000a        ground surface\" (d,e,h).\u000d\u000a    Work for recently completed EU FP7 QUIESST on sustainable procurement of\u000d\u000a      noise barriers using\u000d\u000a      multi-criteria analysis, led by Dr Oltean-Dumbrava (5,6), is further\u000d\u000a      extending our impact in this area\u000d\u000a      by involving a novel method for assessing the overall sustainability of\u000d\u000a      noise reducing devices at the\u000d\u000a      roadside. A key output of this work is a tool to support decision-making\u000d\u000a      by policymakers and\u000d\u000a      industry professionals. In addition the work led to the publication of a\u000d\u000a      guidance manual (i) and a\u000d\u000a      further group TG4 has been set up within CEN TC 226\/WG6, led by Dr\u000d\u000a      Oltean-Dumbrava, to\u000d\u000a      develop such sustainability standards. This is the first group within CEN\u000d\u000a      TC226 road equipment to\u000d\u000a      address this issue and others are likely to follow our lead (j). A very\u000d\u000a      large industry concerned with\u000d\u000a      the provision of roadside barriers will be impacted by the introduction of\u000d\u000a      such standards. As an\u000d\u000a      example of market size the provision of timber barriers along a 2km\u000d\u000a      stretch of highway to protect a\u000d\u000a      residential area would cost approximately &#163;1.6m (6). If more expensive NRD\u000d\u000a      systems were used\u000d\u000a      costs would rise up to an order of magnitude higher and, to gauge scale,\u000d\u000a      many hundreds of\u000d\u000a      kilometres of NRDs are installed across Europe annually.\u000d\u000a    ii) Commercialisation through software: the sound propagation and\u000d\u000a      noise prediction models\u000d\u000a      developed and tested in the research led to the development of six\u000d\u000a      software packages,\u000d\u000a      commercialized in over 40 countries and utilized by private enterprises,\u000d\u000a      public administrations and\u000d\u000a      academia (d, e). The HARMONOISE model led to the development of\u000d\u000a      Predictor-LIMA, CadnaA\u000d\u000a      and the NORD2000 model to the development of ExSound2000, SPL2000,\u000d\u000a      SoundPlan and\u000d\u000a      WindPRO noise prediction software packages. Since 2008, use of NORD2000\u000d\u000a      and HARMONOISE\u000d\u000a      models and software packages has extended from road and railway traffic\u000d\u000a      noise reduction to wind\u000d\u000a      turbine noise, as well as to evaluation of the health effects of noise\u000d\u000a      over a wide spectrum of\u000d\u000a      applications and uses, within and outside Europe (e.g. Brazil, Australia,\u000d\u000a      Canada, Hong Kong,\u000d\u000a      South Korea, Chile, and Taiwan).\u000d\u000a    Estimates of the annual turnover generated by software retail alone is\u000d\u000a      &#8364;600k, based upon an\u000d\u000a      average market price of &#8364;1,000 per licence, three licenses sold per\u000d\u000a        annum per country with 40\u000d\u000a      countries involved worldwide. We should also consider the added value made\u000d\u000a      by consultants using\u000d\u000a      the software. Assuming 40% of licences are sold to consultants and they\u000d\u000a      manage three small\u000d\u000a      projects per annum worth an average of &#8364;3,000 each, we reach a\u000d\u000a      turnover of &#8364;2.16m over the\u000d\u000a      REF2014 period. Taken together the total annual turnover generated by\u000d\u000a      software licences is\u000d\u000a      estimated to be a minimum of &#8364;2.76m.\u000d\u000a    iii) Adoption in national policy requirements: the NORD2000 noise\u000d\u000a      prediction model was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Nordic Council of Ministries and has been used in both\u000d\u000a      private and public\u000d\u000a      sectors (e,h) including public authorities such as the Federal Department\u000d\u000a      of Health in Canada and\u000d\u000a      Scandinavian national and local administrations. In Denmark the use of\u000d\u000a      NORD2000 is mandatory\u000d\u000a      for strategic noise mapping. In addition, NORD2000 is prescribed for\u000d\u000a      general use with road traffic\u000d\u000a      noise, beyond the already existing guidelines for its use for railway\u000d\u000a      noise, and, more recently, for\u000d\u000a      the prediction of sound propagation from wind turbines.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at the University of Bradford has resulted in more accurate and\u000d\u000a      efficient predictions of\u000d\u000a      traffic sound propagation and faster determination of sound reflection\u000d\u000a      effects, enabling more\u000d\u000a      effective design and positioning of noise barriers.

Drawing on the\u000d\u000a      Boundary Element\u000d\u000a      Method (BEM) our team produced a model specifically for application to\u000d\u000a      traffic noise mitigation.\u000d\u000a      BEM is most commonly applied in two-dimensions (2D) for transport noise\u000d\u000a      propagation\u000d\u000a      calculations. Although the true physical problem has distinct differences\u000d\u000a      from the 2D\u000d\u000a      approximation, results from 2D BEM calculations can be successfully and\u000d\u000a      accurately related to\u000d\u000a      physical measurements. Our model offers advantages over ray-tracing\u000d\u000a      methods and other\u000d\u000a      numerical techniques by providing an accurate treatment of the\u000d\u000a      diffraction, scattering and\u000d\u000a      absorption of sound that occurs in the presence of obstacles including\u000d\u000a      noise barriers. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      complex cross-sections can be modelled and specified with considerable\u000d\u000a      precision and the effects\u000d\u000a      of absorptive surfaces and far-field solutions can be computed much more\u000d\u000a      efficiently (1,2). The\u000d\u000a      research also allowed the noise reducing properties of novel barrier caps\u000d\u000a      and the effects of air\u000d\u000a      gaps in barriers to be quantified and demonstrated accurately for the\u000d\u000a      first time (3).\u000d\u000a    Hothersall's development of a Fresnel Zone method of calculating sound\u000d\u000a      reflections from mixed\u000d\u000a      ground conditions (4) both enhanced and simplified the model and paved the\u000d\u000a      way for its use in the\u000d\u000a      HARMONOISE (engineering) and NORD2000 (sound propagation) models. A key\u000d\u000a      contribution of\u000d\u000a      our research was to enable calculation of the zone of influence of\u000d\u000a      reflected sound rays where the\u000d\u000a      ground surface is mixed, a frequency-dependent effect. Our work\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that averaging\u000d\u000a      within the Fresnel zone, despite being a simpler method, resulted in\u000d\u000a      agreement with more complex\u000d\u000a      models and significantly reduced computing times. Our method has been\u000d\u000a      shown to be particularly\u000d\u000a      efficient in complex source situations where ray acoustics was previously\u000d\u000a      the preferred approach\u000d\u000a      e.g. in the calculation of the spread of traffic noise from highways into\u000d\u000a      a large urban area where\u000d\u000a      multiple reflections of sound rays are common. Our research on the\u000d\u000a      calculation of surface\u000d\u000a      reflection effects became a core component of the EU HARMONOISE\u000d\u000a      collaborative project (2000-2003)\u000d\u000a      that produced improved sound propagation models for environmental noise\u000d\u000a      predictions used\u000d\u000a      for both accurate traffic noise prediction and for noise mapping in\u000d\u000a      largely urban areas. The\u000d\u000a      research resulted in the development of a sound propagation model and\u000d\u000a      noise prediction models\u000d\u000a      leading to the development of 6 software packages.\u000d\u000a    The work on NRDs was further extended within the completed EU QUIESST\u000d\u000a      project to improve\u000d\u000a      their sustainability. Dr Oltean-Dumbrava (Lecturer 2003-present), working\u000d\u000a      with Watts, used multi-criteria\u000d\u000a      analysis to develop a novel method for assessing the overall\u000d\u000a      sustainability of roadside\u000d\u000a      NRDs (5,6). The significance of the new work is its demonstration that\u000d\u000a      optimising particular criteria\u000d\u000a      in isolation, e.g. cost and technical performance, does not necessarily\u000d\u000a      increase the sustainability of\u000d\u000a      noise barrier projects. Rather, the research showed that it is the\u000d\u000a      combination of the outcome of all\u000d\u000a      measured criteria (technical, economic, environmental, social) in relation\u000d\u000a      to each other that shows\u000d\u000a      the relative sustainability of the noise reduction project as a whole. The\u000d\u000a      Multi Criteria Decision\u000d\u000a      Making (MCDM) tools produced during the project have been disseminated\u000d\u000a      through an EU\u000d\u000a      guidebook on sustainable procurement of noise barriers.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43936","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Taxi models enhance the quality of information to guide regulatory policy\u000a      decision-making. Direct impacts include service enhancement,\u000a      infrastructure improvement and economic control, examples of which are\u000a      described below.\u000a    Impact may be controversial when a regulator intervenes in a market to\u000a      restrain numbers of licenses issued. The development of the market model\u000a      provides a more thorough test of the impacts than had been in place\u000a      previously, creating a stronger justification for policy decisions. The\u000a     TRI model is widely applied in the UK, such as Glasgow, Perth, Aberdeen,\u000a      West Dunbartonshire and Stirling, and internationally, particularly in the\u000a      USA and Canada. The Toronto model was developed with a specific view to\u000a      identify impacts of introducing accessible vehicles to the taxi fleet, a\u000a      relatively rare occurrence in North America. The Toronto model developed\u000a      an enhanced cost model to identify driver cost impacts, and demand model\u000a      reflecting changes in the market. The City's Taxicab Industry Review made\u000a      use of the model outputs to support a reform of the licensing law to\u000a      include accessibility, set out on the city's website. As a result\u000a      disability access compliant vehicles are available within the standard\u000a      `on-demand' taxi fleet, enhancing quality of life for mobility-impaired\u000a      clients. The model identified impacts of growth scenarios and led to the\u000a      City committing in 2013 to double the number of accessible vehicles in\u000a      time for the Para-Pan-American games being held in 2015. Furthermore a\u000a      long-term requirement for full accessibility was identified by the TRI\u000a      model based on predicted annual costs to the trade and benefits to the\u000a      public.\u000a    The Seattle study was commissioned following the launch of mobile phone\u000a      apps providing access to taxi market services. The city and its hinterland\u000a      had been concerned with the declining levels of taxi services, which was\u000a      confirmed by TRI investigation research. Outcomes of the work included\u000a      defining a new market equilibrium to increase the taxi service levels to\u000a      meet changing urban and rural demand. The integration, within the TRI taxi\u000a      model, of quantity, quality and economic analysis also allowed for\u000a      enhanced service levels using a combination of measures. The initial\u000a      outcomes of Seattle indicated a need to combine quantity and quality\u000a      controls.\u000a    By contrast with Seattle, a focus on economic controls and combinations\u000a      of economic and quantity regulations were required by Boston, Chicago, and\u000a      San Diego. The San Diego project is ongoing and is expected to provide a\u000a      standardized fare allowing reduction in the number of excess fares being\u000a      charged, a practice known locally as fare gouging. The Boston analysis\u000a      focused on the measurement of driver income, a contentious issue in the\u000a      city, with a number of claims being put forward in the Boston Globe\u000a      newspaper suggesting that drivers were receiving third world\u000a      wages. The TRI research identified a measure of driver income\u000a      and economic rent charged in the industry, contributing to the Boston\u000a      Police Department's review of market controls. Other similar benefits\u000a      arise in the application of the model in Chicago, identifying actual\u000a      driver income as an element in determining fare policy, and are repeated\u000a      in San Diego. Finally, meter rate structures that encourage use, and are\u000a      achieved without resulting in excess costs, impacts beneficially on the\u000a      taxi-using public.\u000a    Stand location models developed for Northern Ireland, the Republic of\u000a      Ireland, Aberdeen and Perth allow the location of taxi-stands to be\u000a      determined by actual demand, rather than historic decisions. On-the-ground\u000a      issues included the location of stands that are difficult of access,\u000a      physically inappropriate to wheelchair users, or not served by the trade.\u000a      While incorporation of information about stand location contributes\u000a      directly to the wider demand model it is also appropriate in fine- tuning\u000a      infrastructure. The stand location model, which particularly benefits\u000a      wheelchair users, has been applied in Glasgow, in relation to traffic\u000a      signal timings at the Central Station taxi stand, across the cities of\u000a      Belfast and other Irish cities, Aberdeen and Perth, and is in development\u000a      for San Diego. The model benefits wheelchair users, and the wider public.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Transport Research Institute at Edinburgh Napier University (TRI)\u000a      recognises the importance of taxi research, developing a series of models\u000a      since 2002.

Taxi fleets make a significant\u000a      contribution to the regional economy with taxis representing the largest\u000a      single-use vehicle in many cities. A changing market for taxis, resulting\u000a      from modal split evolution, and the emergence of mobile phone `apps' for\u000a      accessing taxis, points to the need for fit-for-purpose regulatory\u000a      structures and research into these in order to reflect and catch up with\u000a      these marketplace changes. Creating a robust research base is a first step\u000a      to underpinning policy development, as has already happened for other\u000a      transport modes.\u000a    TRI has undertaken taxi research, led by Cooper, since 2002. Recognising\u000a      the lack of a rigorous basis for analysis, initial work focused on\u000a      regulation in medium-sized UK cities and presented a new approach to taxi\u000a      modeling, which was subsequently extended to many North American and other\u000a      developed world cities. Existing taxi models both as applied to quantity\u000a      regulation and cost modeling approaches have provided an effective method\u000a      of determining supply and tariff in isolation. This does not however\u000a      account for the presence of links between the individual modeling\u000a      elements. The identification and consideration of impacts in other\u000a      regulatory domains on the operation of the cost model is significant, as\u000a      it permits calculation of effects of external impacts with a direct impact\u000a      on operational cost. The development of taxi models, as with the wider use\u000a      of models in transportation, can be significant in determining the most\u000a      appropriate forms of supply and in informing policies applied to the mode.\u000a    In collaboration with the International Association of Transport\u000a      Regulators, the Transportation Research Board, the Taxi, Limousine and\u000a      Paratransit Association and the International Road Union and others, new\u000a      applications have been developed to overcome: 1) incomplete or\u000a      unverifiable data, not accounting for new sources; and 2) concentration on\u000a      single issues in isolation created misleading analysis. Research has\u000a      focused on the enhancement of this base, its refinement reflecting\u000a      socio-economic and spatial features of cities, and increased availability\u000a      of data and processing power.

This impact case study outlines the substantial benefits to\u000a      the company, industry sector, environment and home occupants quality of\u000a      life as a result of this original research. The Napier team also developed\u000a      animations to assist installation training for both Bridestop&#169; and Wallcap\u000a      series of products which can be viewed via reference [5.1].\u000a    Impact period 2008-2013: In 2008 brownfield sites accounted for\u000a      over 70% of new housing sites and raft foundations were increasingly\u000a      common. In 2008 the Napier team assisted Icopal-Monarfloor to commence\u000a      application for Robust Detail status for Bridgestop&#169;. This would allow\u000a      entry into the Robust Detail Handbook, which is used by over 8,000\u000a      specifiers and designers across the new build housing sector. Bridgestop&#169;\u000a      achieved on site field trials with an average sound insulation performance\u000a      of 10 dB (decibels) better than building standards, providing the highest\u000a      levels of sound insulation for new housing. The Bridgestop&#169; isolator\u000a      system for raft foundations was awarded Robust Detail status and published\u000a      in October 2008 (reference E-WM-19) [5.2]. The sustainable construction\u000a      benefits [5.2] which when applied over the 15,000 homes built during the\u000a      REF impact period has avoided using 1,080 tonnes of additional gypsum\u000a      lining (72 kg per attached home) to achieve the equivalent sound\u000a      insulation performance. Thus also delivering resource efficiencies in\u000a      materials, transport and carbon. In 2010 Bridgestop&#169; was the first wall\u000a      structure to receive the maximum four credits under the Code for\u000a      Sustainable Homes under Health and Wellbeing for sound insulation [5.3].\u000a      Many supply chain partners benefited from the system including Wimpey\u000a      Homes and Roger Bullivant Ltd [5.2, 5.3]. In 2010 Bridgestop&#169; was\u000a      shortlisted by industry peers for UK Housing Innovation Product of the\u000a      Year [5.4].\u000a    The extension of thin membranes to apartment upper wall-floor junctions\u000a      (termed Wallcap) was supported by the first ever Scottish Enterprise Proof\u000a      of Concept Award for construction sector in March 2008 &#8212; illustrated by\u000a      reference code 8-CON-001. Wallcap was licensed to Icopal-Monarfloor in\u000a      2009 and was shortlisted for UK Housing Innovation Product of the Year in\u000a      2012 [5.5]. Wallcap also complies with the `effective edge seal'\u000a      requirements for the Part L thermal regulations to tackle cavity thermal\u000a      bypass [5.6] which can reduce heat loss by 20% in attached housing. The\u000a      Napier design of the isolators was such that the Manchester production\u000a      line produces zero waste. The cavity wall base is also lined with an\u000a      acoustic isolator involving recycled foam to prevent any mortar drops\u000a      bridging the cavity party walls. Due to the resilience of the\u000a      alumite-bitumen compound within the Bridgestop&#169; dpc material it can also\u000a      act as a methane and radon barrier and also protect such barriers which\u000a      may be placed below the Bridgestop preventing them being damaged or torn\u000a      [5.7]. This benefits home occupants and benefits the intended full life\u000a      cycle of the construction.\u000a    Enhancement of Icopal's existing thin membrane patented technology was\u000a      strengthened as a result of the work with Edinburgh Napier [5.8]. These\u000a      products are now used by aggregate block, aircrete, timber frame and steel\u000a      frame industry sectors. The KTP project with Icopal-Monarfloor delivered\u000a      more than three times the estimated turnover and led to over 50% of\u000a      company profits stemming from these Napier designed products. In May 2013\u000a      the KTP was classified by the Technology Strategy Board as \"outstanding\"\u000a      and nominated for national KTP awards 2013. [5.9]\u000a    Icopal-Monarfloor (UK) is working with the Icopal global group to develop\u000a      similar isolator solutions for wider international markets. 9 new products\u000a      have emerged from the Napier research with a further 4 planned for launch\u000a      in 2014. New industry supply chain partnerships and joint ventures between\u000a      Icopal-Monarfloor and other companies have since been formed including UK\u000a      and other multinational companies (e.g. Knauf).\u000a    The research team have presented their findings to over 200 companies at\u000a      industry seminars and exhibited at Ecobuild, Futurebuild and the Edinburgh\u000a      Science Festival. Finally one of the most powerful statements of the\u000a      benefits from the original research is provided from the company: \"The\u000a        average cost saving on substructure costs, by using Bridgestop and not\u000a        having to undertake expensive alternative build systems is 18%. This has\u000a        since been used in over 15,000 homes across the UK saving &#163;80 million in\u000a        build costs by not having to build alternative constructions involving\u000a        deeper foundations, secondary suspended floors or additional gypsum\u000a        linings which has also resulted in substantial sustainability benefits.\"\u000a      Lee Nichols, Product Development Manager, Icopal Monarfloor.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Edinburgh Napier University was the first to develop thin membrane\u000a      vibration isolators (2005) to allow party walls in new attached homes to\u000a      be built off raft foundations.

This\u000a      bridging of acoustic and vibration transmission is known as flanking\u000a      transmission and reduces insulation performance and quality of life for\u000a      occupants. Future increased use of brownfield sites would require greater\u000a      use of raft foundations. In 2003 new Part E sound insulation building\u000a      standards for England and Wales were the first regulations globally to\u000a      incorporate ISO 717 low frequency spectrum (Ctr) for party walls. This\u000a      placed significant emphasis on lower sound frequencies, and would not\u000a      permit cavity walls to be built off continuous slabs due to flanking sound\u000a      and vibration transmission. If no practical solution was found industry\u000a      build costs were set to increase by a minimum of 18%.\u000a    In 2004 Smith and Wood, both based at Edinburgh Napier\u000a      University, started to investigate possible solutions and several house\u000a      builders offered test sites. Smith's research on sound and\u000a      vibration transmission in complex structures [1,2,3] had identified\u000a      limitations of the existing constructions and influence of the ISO\u000a      spectrum terms (Ctr) for wall and floor systems. Wood, a\u000a      specialist in architectural technology, had previously developed\u000a      construction methodologies which led to the Robust Detail Handbook for\u000a      Part E [2]. In 2005 following a research of material properties Smith\u000a      identified unique vibration and acoustic damping properties of bitumen\u000a      compound thin layers (3mm thick) which would reduce acoustic bridging and\u000a      flanking transmission. In 2005 Smith and Wood researched\u000a      and designed a novel thin membrane system which could be inserted within\u000a      existing house designs and not affect the storey heights. In 2005 the\u000a      research led to a partnership with Icopal-Monarfloor to develop a patent\u000a      application [4] for acoustic thin membranes for separating walls on raft\u000a      foundations called Bridgestop&#169;. Theoretical and parametric studies were\u000a      also carried out for complex cellular blocks as found across European\u000a      construction types.\u000a    During 2007-08 Smith and Wood also developed new Section\u000a      5:Noise design details and performance criteria for the Scottish\u000a      Government. These findings led to advancing acoustic thin membrane\u000a      research into multi-storey applications. In 2007-08 the team secured the\u000a      first ever \"proof of concept\" funding for construction from Scottish\u000a      Enterprise (Project TTAIBA) to extend perimeter isolator research into\u000a      apartments, termed Wallcap. This led to a KTP project (2008-11) with\u000a      Icopal involving extensive laboratory testing in prototype housing systems\u000a      and field tests on sites across the UK. Thermal analysis was included [5],\u000a      as the membranes could reduce cavity convected heat loss and improve\u000a      airtightness within party walls. Research included applications to timber\u000a      and steel frame buildings with patent granted in 2012 [6].\u000a    Increasing building standards can lead to compatibility clashes between\u000a      the Structure, Energy, Environment and Sound Insulation regulations. Due\u000a      to the Napier team knowledge base in addressing such regulatory clashes\u000a      they were awarded 3 years funding (&#163;465,000) from the Scottish Funding\u000a      Council SPIRIT Awards to support demand led research towards technical\u000a      compatibility solutions for the future low carbon housing construction\u000a      sector.\u000a    "}]

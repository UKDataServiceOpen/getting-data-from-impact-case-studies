The Northern Ireland economy is highly reliant on the public\u000d\u000a      sector employing approximately 220,000 people or 31% of the workforce. The\u000d\u000a      review of public administration impacts not only on these employees but\u000d\u000a      ultimately on all those using public services.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the impacts, or how much difference\u000d\u000a      it has made to beneficiaries, is listed as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      By challenging from the outset the premise of the review of public\u000d\u000a        administration, in particular, why government departments were excluded\u000d\u000a        from the review process, it has led to proposals to reduce the number of\u000d\u000a        government departments.\u000d\u000a      By contributing to the public consultation and subsequent policy\u000d\u000a        debate on the proposed number and powers of reorganised local\u000d\u000a        government, the final recommendations for reform have changed\u000d\u000a        accordingly.\u000d\u000a      By the researchers acting as academic advisors to a reform task force,\u000d\u000a        the research has shaped the model for regulating central-local\u000d\u000a        government relations in the future.\u000d\u000a      By conducting the first pilot exercise on community planning in a\u000d\u000a        local authority the research has been used as a benchmark to roll-out\u000d\u000a        this process across Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a      By providing academic advice to two key non-departmental public bodies\u000d\u000a        (Local Government Staff Commission and Northern Ireland Housing Council)\u000d\u000a        earmarked for abolition under the review, their futures have been\u000d\u000a        secured.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Attribution and other significant factors: It will always\u000d\u000a      be difficult to establish a direct cause and effect relationship between\u000d\u000a      research conducted and impacts on public policy. There is however a\u000d\u000a      cumulative body of evidence to suggest that Carmichael and Knox's research\u000d\u000a      was, and continues to be, seen as an independent source of data which had\u000d\u000a      significant influence in a highly political milieu. The review of public\u000d\u000a      administration was initiated in 2002 by the devolved administration at the\u000d\u000a      behest of locally elected ministers. Given the instability associated with\u000d\u000a      the wider political settlement in Northern Ireland, the Assembly was\u000d\u000a      suspended four times during the period between December 1999 and March\u000d\u000a      2007 until the St Andrew's Agreement (2006) resulted in a power sharing\u000d\u000a      Executive. The review of public administration became embroiled in these\u000d\u000a      wider political machinations with British (direct rule) Ministers pushing\u000d\u000a      ahead with public sector reforms against the will of local representatives\u000d\u000a      and `threatening' them to strike a macro political deal or live with the\u000d\u000a      consequences of their imposed reforms (`like it or lump it' approach). In\u000d\u000a      this politically charged environment Carmichael and Knox were able to\u000d\u000a      provide evidenced-based advice to politicians and senior government\u000d\u000a      officials within the wider constraints of these macro political\u000d\u000a      developments.

The research conducted\u000d\u000a      for this project found that Northern Ireland adopted traditional\u000d\u000a      restructuring or `bureau shuffling'. Of itself, this will not lead to an\u000d\u000a      improvement in the quality of public services. The aim of the government\u000d\u000a      appointed review team was to significantly reduce the number of public\u000d\u000a      bodies and create common boundaries - a kind of selective administrative\u000d\u000a      rationalisation which excluded core elements of the Executive such as\u000d\u000a      government departments. The research found that the reforms were\u000d\u000a      disjointed with little, if any, similarity to the modernising public\u000d\u000a      services agenda in the rest of the United Kingdom. This comparison, in\u000d\u000a      itself, may not be important since reforms in any particular country will\u000d\u000a      almost certainly be shaped by the local context and the priorities of the\u000d\u000a      politicians which are likely to vary considerably. The socio-economic,\u000d\u000a      political and administrative context of Northern Ireland and the role\u000d\u000a      played by elite actors undoubtedly influenced what emerged from the reform\u000d\u000a      agenda.\u000d\u000a    The expectations of the Review of Public Administration were enormous.\u000d\u000a      Without question the structure of public administration in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland will benefit from this rationalisation process, if only in helping\u000d\u000a      the public to manoeuvre their way around the public sector maze. The\u000d\u000a      review estimated potential savings of between &#163;150 - &#163;235m resulting from\u000d\u000a      the changes and argued that these resources will be redirected into\u000d\u000a      front-line services. Conveniently this allows for limited transparency in\u000d\u000a      the outcomes of the review (savings are absorbed) and hence the most\u000d\u000a      obvious expression of its `success' is reducing the number of public\u000d\u000a      bodies. Given the high visibility of local authorities, they have become\u000d\u000a      an easy `target' and one which the media latch on to as an example of\u000d\u000a      radical reform in language such as `axing councils'. What is on offer,\u000d\u000a      however, under the guise of comprehensive reform and strong local\u000d\u000a      government, amounts to little more than tinkering at the margins &#8212; bureau\u000d\u000a      shuffling writ large.\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research was to constantly hold the reformers to\u000d\u000a      account against claims made that structural reform (e.g. reorganising\u000d\u000a      health, education, and local government) would lead inexorably to better\u000d\u000a      quality public services in Northern Ireland.

By October 2013 it remained the only published independent primary\u000d\u000aresearch on regimes for children in custody in NI. Significant impacts are detailed below.\u000d\u000a4.1 Inspiring rights-based regimes and policies within Woodlands. The research has been\u000d\u000aacknowledged by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Youth Justice Agency (YJA) and\u000d\u000achildren's rights organisations (sources g, h and i) as having impacted on the creation of a\u000d\u000aregime at Woodlands. that has an international reputation for excellence and which has been\u000d\u000ahighly praised by the Criminal Justice Inspection (NI) inspectors in recent years. While plans\u000d\u000awere being made for the development of Woodlands, the authors along with Human Rights\u000d\u000aCommissioners, held regular meetings with professionals and officials from the Northern Ireland\u000d\u000aOffice (NIO), the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the YJA, the Social Services Inspectorate\u000d\u000aand the Criminal Justice Inspection to discuss in detail the research findings and\u000d\u000arecommendations. Commitments were given regarding many of these. In the years following the\u000d\u000apublication of the report, its impact included:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aenhanced investigation of child protection incidents;\u000d\u000agreater provision of support for families;\u000d\u000areduction in the use of custody for children;\u000d\u000aenhanced training of staff in mediating conflict;\u000d\u000areduction in the use of physical restraint;\u000d\u000aimproved induction procedures;\u000d\u000athe provision of individual care plans;\u000d\u000aimprovement of education and health care provision for children in custody;\u000d\u000athe introduction of an independent complaints mechanism.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aA key impact in terms of significance has been, and continues to be, on the lives of children in\u000d\u000acustody, given the development of more rights-compliant regimes. Custodial staff have also\u000d\u000abenefited, by way of an improved environment and enhanced training. The Director of has written\u000d\u000a(source f): `By providing a sound research basis which organisations could use for lobbying\u000d\u000agovernment and informing monitoring bodies (including international bodies) the research had a\u000d\u000aclear impact on the lives of children and young persons in custody in Northern Ireland for\u000d\u000awhom there are improved conditions and regimes'.\u000d\u000a(4.2) Influencing Youth Justice Policy. The Head of the Youth Justice Unit, DOJ, closely\u000d\u000ainvolved in advancing new policies and their implementation, has acknowledged that the research\u000d\u000a`helped to establish a strategic direction of travel' that included `adoption of the \"best interests\u000d\u000aprinciple\"; the removal of children from Prison Service custody; the strengthening of\u000d\u000aChildren Order protection; and a local Minister of Justice advocating for the minimum age\u000d\u000aof criminal responsibility to be increased.' He stated, `without hesitation', that `the research and\u000d\u000athe discussions around its implementation contributed to the development of children's rights,\u000d\u000acompliant policies and practices within the youth justice system in NI' (source i). The research\u000d\u000aevidence base underpinned the successful campaign for the removal of girls under the age of 18\u000d\u000afrom the prison system in 2009, and more recently of boys under 18. All children in custody are\u000d\u000anow accommodated in Woodlands Juvenile Justice Centre. The evidence and recommendations\u000d\u000apresented in the research have also been drawn upon during on-going discussions on the age of\u000d\u000acriminal responsibility, most recently at a seminar on youth justice approaches across the four UK\u000d\u000ajurisdictions and the Republic of Ireland.\u000d\u000a(4.3) Influencing the inclusion of a review of children and the criminal justice system within\u000d\u000athe Hillsborough Agreement. The research is acknowledged as having provided a `strong\u000d\u000aplatform' for children's rights organisations to advocate for the inclusion of a review of children and\u000d\u000acriminal justice within the multi-party Hillsborough Agreement (2010) (source g). The Youth Justice\u000d\u000aReview Team reported in 2011, its recommendations mirroring those from the research including\u000d\u000athe need to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility. Convery and Moore gave\u000d\u000aevidence to both the Youth Justice and Prison Review teams on several occasions and in\u000d\u000aNovember 2010 organised a multi-disciplinary symposium, with colleagues at QUB, and, with\u000d\u000asupport from IRISS, to inform the Prison Review Team, including the chair Dame Anne Owers,\u000d\u000aabout relevant research findings.\u000d\u000a(4.4). Providing an evidence base for lobbying locally and in international fora. The research\u000d\u000ahas provided a solid evidence base utilised by children's rights and human rights organisations in\u000d\u000alobbying on a national and international level (for example in shadow reports to the UN Committee\u000d\u000aon the Rights of the Child and in submissions to the Youth Justice Review). Evidence from the\u000d\u000aresearch has contributed to lobbying on issues including the minimum age of criminal\u000d\u000aresponsibility; separation of children from adults in custody; and provision of greater mental health\u000d\u000asupport for detained children. The NIHRC submission to the Youth Justice Review referenced the\u000d\u000aresearch (source d). The Director of the Children's Law Centre has confirmed that, in informing its\u000d\u000aadvocacy work and engagement with monitoring bodies, `the research had a significant, positive\u000d\u000aand indisputable impact in the protection of the rights of children and young people in custody in\u000d\u000aNI' (source g). For further evidence see sources a, b and c below.\u000d\u000a(4.5) Evidence base used within the successful campaign to extend the powers of the\u000d\u000aHuman Rights Commission. Under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, Section 69, the NIHRC had\u000d\u000aauthority to conduct investigations but had no associated powers of entry or disclosure. Indeed,\u000d\u000aConvery and Moore were barred by the NIO from accessing the JJC to conduct fieldwork in 2004,\u000d\u000athus delaying the research. The bar on access was criticised by the UN Committee Against Torture\u000d\u000ain its concluding observations on the UK (2004). This was reinforced by evidence given by other\u000d\u000aindependent bodies, for example the Committee on the Administration of Justice (NI-based NGO)\u000d\u000aand by British Irish Rights Watch to the Joint Committee on Human Rights at Westminster. In\u000d\u000aFebruary 2005, the NIHRC came to an out of court settlement with the NIO which granted access\u000d\u000ato conduct the research. NIHRC powers were extended through the Justice and Security (NI) Act,\u000d\u000a2007 giving powers of access to places of detention and to compel evidence. These enhanced\u000d\u000apowers have had a positive impact on the continued investigations work of the NIHRC.\u000d\u000a(4.6) Inspiring developments beyond Northern Ireland. In terms of reach, the international\u000d\u000areputation of Woodlands extends the influence of the research beyond Northern Ireland. The Chief\u000d\u000aExecutive of the YJA has written (4\/10\/13 source h) to acknowledge the `importance of the\u000d\u000aresearch of Dr Una Convery and Dr Linda Moore Still In Our Care: Protecting the Rights of\u000d\u000aChildren in Custody carried out in 2006 for the Juvenile Justice Centre (Woodlands) as it has\u000d\u000adeveloped over the last seven years'. She continued, `Woodlands has maintained and increased\u000d\u000aits reputation as an example of best practice for the detention of young people in custody'. The\u000d\u000ainternational reputation of Woodlands has been recognised in research elsewhere (source c). The\u000d\u000aresearch has been presented at a range of conferences across Europe open to youth justice\u000d\u000apractitioners, including representatives from children's rights organisations and policy makers, and\u000d\u000apublished in the international text edited by Sheehan et al (2012, see 3 above).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aResearch by Dr Una Convery and Dr Linda Moore (respectively Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in\u000d\u000aCriminology) has significantly influenced rights-compliance in policy, legislation and practice\u000d\u000aregarding youth custody in Northern Ireland and beyond. Most notably, it impacted decisively on\u000d\u000athe development of innovative regimes and policies at NI's only custodial centre for\u000d\u000achildren and improved their conditions. It also influenced decisions on reduced custodial levels\u000d\u000aand the removal of children from the penal system. By providing a solid evidence base, utilised by\u000d\u000alobbyists and political representatives, the research influenced the inclusion of independent\u000d\u000areviews of the penal and youth justice systems within the multi-party Hillsborough Agreement\u000d\u000a(2010).

It documented poor regimes for children in\u000d\u000acustody characterized by an over-use of physical restraint and isolation; deficient child protection\u000d\u000aprocedures; limited education and health provision; and inadequate rehabilitative support. In\u000d\u000ageneral the staff were under-trained and demoralised. In the case of Lisnevin, allegations of verbal\u000d\u000aand physical abuse of children were highlighted. Across the system, many children were detained\u000d\u000afor very minor offending. Most children in custody were on remand, contrary to international rights\u000d\u000astandards. The authors made 170 recommendations, which were adopted as NIHRC policy.\u000d\u000aThese included: the closure of Lisnevin; reduction in levels of physical restraint; improvement in\u000d\u000achild protection procedures and an end to the custodial detention of very young children. A\u000d\u000asignificant increase in the age of criminal responsibility was recommended. The research gained\u000d\u000awidespread media and political attention and was used as evidence by the NIHRC and by\u000d\u000achildren's and human rights organisations to support their lobbying activities.\u000d\u000aBy the publication of Still in Our Care (2006) the three JJCs had been closed and replaced by a\u000d\u000asingle institution, the JJC for Northern Ireland. Still in Our Care was based on qualitative methods\u000d\u000aincluding observations of the regime; analysis of case-files; and in-depth interviews with children,\u000d\u000acustodial staff and a range of practitioners and decision makers. The research found that many of\u000d\u000athe previous recommendations had been implemented including: legislative change based on\u000d\u000agreater emphasis on restorative justice measures and diversion; fewer very young children (aged\u000d\u000a10-12 years) in custody; improved staff training leading to less reliance on physical restraint;\u000d\u000aenhanced child protection procedures; developments regarding bail support; improved educational\u000d\u000aand health care provision; introduction of an independent complaints mechanism.\u000d\u000aSome recommendations had not yet been progressed: it was observed that children aged 16 and\u000d\u000a17 were still liable to be detained in prison custody. Having documented progress, Still in Our Care\u000d\u000awent on to make a series of evidence-based recommendations for further development including:\u000d\u000abetter support for families; increased resettlement provision; responsibility for all under-18s in\u000d\u000acustody to be transferred to the Youth Justice Agency (YJA); explicit incorporation of children's\u000d\u000arights within the custodial standards; reduction in the detention of children under the Police and\u000d\u000aCriminal Evidence (NI) Order, 1989.

The reach and significance of this research and pathways\u000d\u000ato impact are as follows, presented in accord with the impacts summarised in Section 1 above.\u000d\u000aImpact 1, 2 &amp; 3: The Northern Ireland Policing Board (NIPB), the main policing accountability\u000d\u000amechanism in Northern Ireland, has used Lundy's research to monitor, scrutinise and hold\u000d\u000aPSNI\/HET to account (Source 1). Since 2009 Lundy has been invited to present her research\u000d\u000afindings to the Human Rights and Professional Standards Committee (hereafter HRC) of the NIPB.\u000d\u000aA measure of Lundy's contribution is shown in a letter of thanks from the HRC which\u000d\u000aacknowledges `the contribution of the research and the gratitude of the Human Rights and\u000d\u000aProfessional Standards Committee' (letter on file in Research Office). As a result of Lundy's\u000d\u000aengagement with the NIPB, the Chief Constable (PSNI) and HET Senior Management have been\u000d\u000acalled before the Board to respond to concerns raised in her research. As a direct result PSNI\u000d\u000astated that changes have been made to HET processes and procedures. This is evidenced in\u000d\u000aconfidential documentation, `HET Current Situation Report', April 2009 and letter to NIPB from\u000d\u000aDavid Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, CS 49\/09, 30 March 2009 (copies on file), and is further\u000d\u000adocumented in the UK Government Submission to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers,\u000d\u000a2009 (Source 3). In March 2012, Lundy's most recent research findings were presented to the\u000d\u000aNIPB (Source 1). On April 5th 2012 in a private meeting with the NIPB, and during a full public\u000d\u000asession, the Chief Constable was obliged to respond to concerns raised in Lundy's research\u000d\u000a(Source 1). This led directly to the Minister of Justice, at the request of the Chief Constable,\u000d\u000acommissioning an investigation into the work of the HET by HMIC. In a public statement the Chief\u000d\u000aConstable said: `I absolutely recognise there are public concerns and concerns around families in\u000d\u000aregard to this [Lundy's] report... I do acknowledge the public concerns and the need to reassure\u000d\u000afamilies and take an independent look at this' (Source 1). Lundy's evidence-based research was\u000d\u000apivotal in holding the PSNI to account and compelling the Chief Constable and Minister of Justice\u000d\u000ato commission the HMIC inspection. This is evidenced further in HMIC Terms of Reference which\u000d\u000astate that the inspection is: `to determine whether HET investigation processes in RMP cases, as\u000d\u000aoutlined in the research conducted by Patricia Lundy, meet the requirement benchmarks and\u000d\u000astandards' (Source 2). HMIC's inspection report confirmed all of Lundy's research findings\u000d\u000a(Source 2). Stephen Otter of HMIC said in his report: `Dr Lundy had presented a report that at the\u000d\u000atime was made out to be untrue. What is indefensible is that she did make these findings in 2009,\u000d\u000aso for four years nothing was being done to address those findings and I do find that that is very\u000d\u000adifficult to believe. I do think [Lundy] deserves an apology from the chief constable on behalf of the\u000d\u000aPSNI' (Source 9: article `HET exposed'). As noted, a direct policy change resulting from Lundy's\u000d\u000aresearch is HMIC recommended the HET should: \"immediately draft a revised policy approach to\u000d\u000astate involvement cases and seek the DPP for Northern Ireland agreement to it\" (Source 2). The\u000d\u000aPolicing Board has established a Working Group to implement HMIC's recommendations, the\u000d\u000aHET's Director and Deputy Director resigned, all HET military case-reviews have been suspended\u000d\u000aand there is a complete overhaul of HET underway. In this regard, HMIC recommended an\u000d\u000aindependent oversight panel be established to oversee and scrutinise in the public interest all\u000d\u000aaspects of HET work. This is an important and unprecedented structural change to the PSNI\/HET\u000d\u000ainvestigation of historic cases which resulted directly from Professor Lundy's research. However\u000d\u000athe fate of the HET is still playing out. The Chief Constable has informed the NIPB that he has \"not\u000d\u000aruled out suspending the work of the HET\"; and \"all options are open\" (Source 1). NIPB has\u000d\u000astated that it will use Lundy's research as a case study to assess its own processes internally.\u000d\u000aImpact 4 &amp; 5: Lundy's research has been used to hold the UK authorities to account in the\u000d\u000aCommittee of Ministers (CM), Council of Europe (Source 3). Since 2008\/9 the research has\u000d\u000ainformed and assisted the CM in oversight and monitoring of the UK government's compliance with\u000d\u000aobligations which have arisen as a result of ECtHR judgements involving Article 2 cases (Source\u000d\u000a3). Article 2 of the ECHR protects the right to life and places a duty on a State to investigate\u000d\u000asuspicious deaths by means of an Article 2-compliant process (i.e. independent, effective, prompt\u000d\u000aand transparent). The pathway to impact was direct engagement and sharing of research findings\u000d\u000awith `users' at various stages of the research. Over a number of years the research findings have\u000d\u000abeen disseminated by means of public and private meetings, closed roundtables, briefing papers\u000d\u000aand briefing sessions with a wide range of beneficiaries. As a direct result, Lundy's research has\u000d\u000abeen used to significantly inform submissions to the CM by leading human rights NGOs\u000d\u000a(Committee on the Administration of Justice and Pat Finucane Centre) and victims' groups\u000d\u000a(Relatives for Justice) (Source 3). The UK authorities were obliged to respond to the concerns\u000d\u000araised in Lundy's research and this is detailed in submissions to the CM (Source 3). Lundy\u000d\u000ahas been invited to brief the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Irish Government; and there have\u000d\u000abeen frequent follow up meetings with senior officials which directly fed into DFA submissions to\u000d\u000athe CM. Of huge significance is that Lundy's research has led to debate in the Northern Ireland\u000d\u000aAssembly (Committee for Justice), and questions being raised by NIBP and HMIC, as to\u000d\u000awhether the UK authorities and\/or HET\/PSNI \"misled the Committee of Ministers\" (Source 1,\u000d\u000a2 &amp; 4). Further evidence of reach and significance is that Lundy was invited to present expert\u000d\u000awitness testimony (based on her research) to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in\u000d\u000aEurope hearing on `Prerequisites for Progress in Northern Ireland', also known as the\u000d\u000aHelsinki Commission, sitting in Washington (Source 5). The HET has been promoted by the\u000d\u000aCM as a model for other countries to emulate and could be adopted by more Council of Europe\u000d\u000astates investigating alleged state killings. This led a delegation of Russian human rights groups\u000d\u000aand lawyers advising on Chechnyan cases to visit Ulster to be briefed by Professor Lundy on her\u000d\u000aHET research and findings. (http:\/\/www.socsci.ulster.ac.uk\/irss\/231111.htm).\u000d\u000aImpact 5 &amp; 6: Lundy's research has contributed to and significantly renewed the on-going public\u000d\u000adiscussion and policy debate about how best to address the legacy of conflict in NI. The research\u000d\u000ahas been widely reported in the media as headline news (TV and radio) and generated\u000d\u000aconsiderable public debate and opinion pieces on national social media sites (Source 8), and also\u000d\u000ainternational sites including the highly influential Irish National Caucus in Washington (Source 9).\u000d\u000aFor the past 30 years the Irish National Caucus based on Capitol Hill, Washington, has been a\u000d\u000ahighly effective independent lobbying organisation working successfully to influence congressional\u000d\u000apolicy on NI. In addition, the NI Commission for Victims and Survivors (NICVS) selected\u000d\u000aLundy's research publication `Can the Past be Policed?' as one of five key policy\u000d\u000adocuments and related reports that have informed the debate in the area of truth, justice\u000d\u000aand acknowledgement to date' (Source 6). The influence on policy debate is further evidenced in\u000d\u000athe use of Lundy's work in a NIO consultation report on how to deal with the past (Source 7), and\u000d\u000ain submissions by political parties, victims groups and human rights NGOs to official consultations\u000d\u000aon dealing with the legacy of the past (copies on file). The research is currently feeding directly into\u000d\u000aNI's inter-party talks dealing with parades, flags and the past, led by former White House US\u000d\u000aspecial envoy Richard Haass (Source 9: article `Trying to pre-empt Haass'). Professor Lundy has\u000d\u000abeen invited to meet with the `Haass Talks Team' of one of NI's main political parties for\u000d\u000adiscussions around the forthcoming inter-party talks. Through pathways to impact, including\u000d\u000asustained direct engagement with stakeholders, Lundy's research has directly impacted on a wide\u000d\u000arange of beneficiaries. It has informed individual victims, justice campaigns and the legal\u000d\u000aprofession seeking redress for victims both domestically and internationally and NGOs demands\u000d\u000afor alternative `truth' and justice processes. Her work has directly informed legal submissions to the\u000d\u000aAttorney General (NI) to re-open inquests, legal proceedings (Source 9; article `Suing NI Police')\u000d\u000aand campaigns for public inquiries (http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-18520216).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aProfessor Patricia Lundy's research, which began in 2005 and continues today, has:\u000d\u000a1) Directly led to the Minister of Justice commissioning HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC)\u000d\u000ato investigate the Police Service of Northern Ireland's Historical Enquiries Team (PSNI\/HET).\u000d\u000a2) Directly led to the Northern Ireland Policing Board (NIPB) holding the PSNI to account; and a\u000d\u000areassessment of the Board's own procedures.\u000d\u000a3) Directly led to the resignation of HET's Director and Deputy Director, suspension of all military\u000d\u000acase-reviews, complete overhaul of HET, and policy changes in how PSNI\/HET investigates\u000d\u000ahistoric crimes.\u000d\u000a4) Directly led to Committee of Ministers holding the UK government to account with regards to\u000d\u000afulfilment of its obligations deriving from European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) judgements\u000d\u000aand HET Article-2 compliance.\u000d\u000a5) Directly led to reopening inquests, legal proceedings and informing stakeholders.\u000d\u000a6) Directly created critical public debate about the future of the HET and policy more generally\u000d\u000aaround addressing the legacy of NI conflict.\u000d\u000a","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000aUniversity of Ulster\u000d\u000a","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Ulster (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Ulster","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10007807}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"7521316","Name":"Ulster"},{"GeoNamesId":"569665","Name":"Chechenskaya Respublika"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a\u000aa) Lundy, Patricia (2012 April) Research Brief: Assessment of HET Review Processes and\u000d\u000aProcedures in Royal Military Police Investigation Cases.\u000d\u000a\u000a\u000ab) Lundy, Patricia (2011) Paradoxes and Challenges of Transitional Justice at the 'Local' Level:\u000d\u000aHistorical Enquiries in Northern Ireland, Contemporary Social Science, 6 (1), pp. 89-106.\u000d\u000a\u000a\u000ac) Lundy, Patricia (2010) Commissioning the Past in Northern Ireland, Review of International\u000d\u000aAffairs, LX (1138-1139), pp.101-133.\u000d\u000a\u000a\u000ad) Lundy, Patricia (2009) Can the Past Be Policed?

This impact\u000d\u000acase study concentrates on an in-depth critical analysis of the Historical Enquiries Team of\u000d\u000athe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI\/HET). The research, funded by a number of\u000d\u000aresearch awards and developed with the engagement of a range of beneficiaries, was carried out\u000d\u000asolely by Patricia Lundy. The research commenced August 2005 and remains ongoing. During this\u000d\u000aperiod Lundy was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Ulster, promoted to Professor in\u000d\u000aSeptember 2012. The policy approach to dealing with the legacy of Northern Ireland's conflict and\u000d\u000ahuman rights abuses has been fragmented and highly contested. In response to victims' demands\u000d\u000aand directives from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), the UK Government\u000d\u000aimplemented a `package of measures'. The HET is a key component of the `package'. Its remit is to\u000d\u000are-examine all deaths attributable to the Northern Ireland conflict (1969-1998) and to bring a\u000d\u000a`measure of resolution' to bereaved relatives by answering unanswered questions. Lundy was\u000d\u000agranted unfettered access to the HET by the then Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde. This\u000d\u000ademonstrates recognition of her expertise and knowledge of this highly sensitive topic. The specific\u000d\u000aaims of the research were to:\u000d\u000aa) Examine to what extent HET can be considered effective according to standards and\u000d\u000abenchmarks derived from the UK's obligations under Article 2 of the European Convention on\u000d\u000aHuman Rights (ECHR) (i.e. independence, effectiveness, promptness, and transparency).\u000d\u000ab) Assess to what extent HET was perceived by victims and other stakeholders as meeting their\u000d\u000aneeds.\u000d\u000ac) Explore and identify deficiencies, structural impediments, obstacles and obstructions to fulfilling\u000d\u000aits remit.\u000d\u000ad) Advance the understanding and practice of transitional justice processes in a leading liberal\u000d\u000ademocracy.\u000d\u000aThe methodology included observation of HET day-to-day operations, interviews with HET staff\u000d\u000aand a wide range of beneficiaries, and in-depth document analysis.\u000d\u000aResearch findings: The research found differentiation in treatment and deficiencies in HET\/PSNI\u000d\u000ainvestigations. It exposed anomalies and inconsistencies in the investigation process where\u000d\u000aagencies of the state were involved compared to non-state or paramilitary suspects. It raised\u000d\u000aquestions about the ability of the HET to undertake ECHR Article-2 compliant investigations (i.e.\u000d\u000aindependent, effective, prompt and transparent) in cases involving state agencies and\/or cases\u000d\u000athat may impinge upon the police themselves, and whether the UK government was meeting its\u000d\u000aobligations deriving from ECtHR judgements. The research found further a lack of independence\u000d\u000aassociated with the role of intelligence gatekeepers and the influence of `corporate or institutional\u000d\u000amemory' arising from the rehiring of retired police officers in connection with HET investigations.\u000d\u000aThis led to further serious questions being raised about the lack of oversight, and practice, of\u000d\u000arehiring retired police officers as part of HET. This development fed into wider intense political\u000d\u000adebate over PSNI policy of rehiring retired officers, and commitment to policing reform. The\u000d\u000aresearch undertaken by Lundy showed that access to `the truth' was limited by HET procedures\u000d\u000aand victims had to know the `right questions' to ask. The quality and depth of reports improved\u000d\u000asignificantly when NGOs, legal or other representatives assisted victims' families. The Unionist\u000d\u000acommunity, and bereaved families of the British army, were shown to be less well represented.\u000d\u000aThis lack of representation influenced the quality of HET reports and access to justice. In contrast\u000d\u000ato official claims, interviews with victims revealed dissatisfaction with HET output and a failure to\u000d\u000aanswer some families' questions. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary Inspection\u000d\u000a(HMIC) Report published July 1 2013, and commissioned by the Minister of Justice in\u000d\u000aresponse to Lundy's research (Source 1 &amp; 2), confirmed all of Professor Lundy's research\u000d\u000afindings (Source 2). HMIC concluded that the HET did treat state involvement cases differently as\u000d\u000aa matter of policy, that HET acted outside the law and its practice was inconsistent with the UK's\u000d\u000aobligations under Article 2 ECHR. HMIC concluded that that many of its findings had been made in\u000d\u000a2009 by Lundy; HMIC's report extensively quoted her articles `Can the Past be Policed?'(d); and\u000d\u000aResearch Brief (a), as corroborating evidence in making their case. A direct policy change\u000d\u000aresulting from Professor Lundy's research is HMIC recommended the HET should: \"immediately\u000d\u000awithdraw paragraph 6.19 of its Operational Guide; draft a revised policy approach to state\u000d\u000ainvolvement cases; seek the DPP for Northern Ireland agreement to it; and then publish it to HET\u000d\u000amembers and other interested parties.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"1432","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Reform of the UK's parallel systems of social care and disability\u000d\u000a      benefits - Attendance Allowance\u000d\u000a      (AA) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) - for older people have been\u000d\u000a      the subject of active\u000d\u000a      debate for a number of years. AA and DLA are not means-tested. The 2006\u000d\u000a      King's Fund Review of\u000d\u000a      Social Care (chaired by Sir Derek Wanless) suggested that public funds\u000d\u000a      used for AA and DLA\u000d\u000a      might be better channelled through the means-tested social care system, on\u000d\u000a      the grounds that AA\u000d\u000a      and DLA were not well targeted on those in greatest financial or\u000d\u000a      disability need. The then\u000d\u000a      Government's 2009 Green Paper on the future of care endorsed the option of\u000d\u000a      redirecting funds\u000d\u000a      away from disability benefits into social care as worthy of further\u000d\u000a      consideration. Our research\u000d\u000a      challenged the premise that AA and DLA are not well targeted.\u000d\u000a    We highlighted a fundamental flaw in previous analyses which had\u000d\u000a      suggested that recipients of AA\u000d\u000a      and DLA were located within the middle and upper parts of the income\u000d\u000a      distribution. Our first\u000d\u000a      analysis drawing attention to this flaw was published in February 2008 and\u000d\u000a      also presented to a\u000d\u000a      seminar held at number 11 Downing Street, in the presence of the then\u000d\u000a      minister for social care.\u000d\u000a      The journalist David Brindle covered our findings in the Society pages of\u000d\u000a      The Guardian the same\u000d\u000a      day.\u000d\u000a    We then conducted more detailed research and drew on it in written\u000d\u000a      evidence to the Health Select\u000d\u000a      Committee's 2009-10 Inquiry into Social Care. Our written evidence was\u000d\u000a      used by Age UK in their\u000d\u000a      oral evidence (corroborating source 1a) and by a committee member in the\u000d\u000a      oral evidence session\u000d\u000a      with the Secretary of State for Health and senior officials from the\u000d\u000a      Departments of Health and Work\u000d\u000a      and Pensions (source 1b). It was also quoted heavily in the Committee's\u000d\u000a      report published on 4th\u000d\u000a      March 2010 (source 2). The Committee called on the Department of Health to\u000d\u000a      publish evidence\u000d\u000a      that contradicted our research, if they had any. The White Paper on Social\u000d\u000a      Care published on 30th\u000d\u000a      March 2010 ruled out, at least for the next Parliament, any reform of AA\u000d\u000a      and DLA to fund its\u000d\u000a      proposed reform of social care.\u000d\u000a    The subsequent change of government led to the establishment of the\u000d\u000a      Commission on Funding\u000d\u000a      Care and Support (CFSC) whose report recommended retaining non\u000d\u000a      means-tested disability\u000d\u000a      benefits for older people. Before its report was published we presented\u000d\u000a      our research at a high\u000d\u000a      profile seminar organised by the Strategic Society Centre (source 3) which\u000d\u000a      was attended by\u000d\u000a      representatives from the CFSC, relevant government departments (HM\u000d\u000a      Treasury, Department of\u000d\u000a      Health, Department for Work and Pensions), voluntary sector organisations\u000d\u000a      (e.g. Age UK), Local\u000d\u000a      Authorities, the private insurance sector and academics. Papers and\u000d\u000a      briefings published by the\u000d\u000a      Strategic Society Centre (sources 4 and 5) and Age UK (source 6) quoted\u000d\u000a      heavily from our work,\u000d\u000a      and have continued to do so (source 9). The 2012 Welfare Reform Act has\u000d\u000a      replaced DLA with\u000d\u000a      Personal Independence Payment for new claimants, which differs from DLA in\u000d\u000a      detail but remains a\u000d\u000a      non means-tested benefit for disabled people. AA is still in place. For\u000d\u000a      the foreseeable future older\u000d\u000a      people in the UK therefore retain access to non means-tested cash\u000d\u000a      disability benefits to help them\u000d\u000a      meet the costs that disability brings and these benefits are no longer\u000d\u000a      seen as a primary source of\u000d\u000a      funding for social care reform. They currently reach some 2.44 million\u000d\u000a      people aged 65+ in Great\u000d\u000a      Britain. These are the immediate beneficiaries of the decision to retain\u000d\u000a      these benefits.

This system consists of two main types of support: care,\u000d\u000a      largely in the form of\u000d\u000a      services, provided via public bodies after an assessment of care needs,\u000d\u000a      for which recipients pay\u000d\u000a      user charges determined through a means test; and cash benefits paid on\u000d\u000a      the basis of disability\u000d\u000a      and care needs, which are not means tested. The aspect of our research\u000d\u000a      which led to the impact\u000d\u000a      described in this case study was analysis of data from three high quality\u000d\u000a      household surveys (the\u000d\u000a      Family Resources Survey, the British Household Panel Survey and the\u000d\u000a      English Longitudinal Study\u000d\u000a      of Ageing). Our analysis sought to establish the determinants of receipt\u000d\u000a      of the two disability\u000d\u000a      benefits, Attendance Allowance (AA) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA),\u000d\u000a      among older people,\u000d\u000a      paying particular attention to (1) the role of income (measured excluding\u000d\u000a      these benefits), (2) the\u000d\u000a      influence of severity of disability accounting for potential measurement\u000d\u000a      error in the self-reported\u000d\u000a      indicators of disability available in surveys and (3) the degree of\u000d\u000a      agreement in data from different\u000d\u000a      surveys. To assess the extent to which older disabled people could afford\u000d\u000a      (or not) to lose AA\/DLA\u000d\u000a      we also examined the likely consequences for poverty rates among older\u000d\u000a      people of various forms\u000d\u000a      of means-testing AA and DLA.\u000d\u000a    Our analysis made a specific contribution on the definition of income. It\u000d\u000a      highlighted the need to\u000d\u000a      exclude AA\/DLA (or the costs they are intended to meet) from the\u000d\u000a      definition of income when\u000d\u000a      considering where recipients are in the distribution of income (and by\u000d\u000a      implication of living\u000d\u000a      standards). To do otherwise gives a misleadingly favourable view of the\u000d\u000a      position of disabled\u000d\u000a      people. By comparing their position including and excluding AA and DLA, we\u000d\u000a      were able to show\u000d\u000a      that the effect of inappropriately including AA\/DLA in income is\u000d\u000a      substantial. A second contribution\u000d\u000a      was to derive continuous measures of `latent' disability (using a latent\u000d\u000a      variable structural equation\u000d\u000a      modelling approach) which enabled a better assessment of the influence of\u000d\u000a      severity of disability on\u000d\u000a      receipt of AA\/DLA than is possible using only the discrete indicators of\u000d\u000a      disability in surveys. Finally\u000d\u000a      we were able to show through our analysis that three major British surveys\u000d\u000a      led to the same\u000d\u000a      conclusion: AA and DLA are well targeted in terms of both financial and\u000d\u000a      care needs.\u000d\u000a    The UEA research team consisted of Hancock (Professor in the Economics of\u000d\u000a      Health and Welfare\u000d\u000a      at UEA since January 2008) and Morciano (Researcher at UEA since June\u000d\u000a      2008).

An evaluation of the impact\u000d\u000a      of the campaign\u000d\u000a      (Francas 2010) found that 60% of Hull men surveyed had noticed the\u000d\u000a      campaign and one in\u000d\u000a      three exposed to the campaign described their thinking on domestic\u000d\u000a      violence as changed by\u000d\u000a      the campaign. The research can therefore be said to have played a\u000d\u000a      significant role in shifting\u000d\u000a      attitudes to domestic violence in the local population and in preparing\u000d\u000a      the targeted group to\u000d\u000a      utilise the new service for abusive men.\u000d\u000a    This was the first social marketing campaign to be targeted on male\u000d\u000a    perpetrators of domestic\u000d\u000a    violence in England and Wales and it was cited by government as a model of\u000d\u000a    good practice\u000d\u000a    [C].

The study also identified a range of innovative\u000d\u000a      approaches for co-\u000d\u000a      ordinating risk assessment by the police and children's social services\u000d\u000a      [3].\u000d\u000a    The `Men's Talk' study of men's views [4] concerning domestic violence\u000d\u000a      and their\u000d\u000a      motivations for changing abusive behaviour was undertaken 2008-09 by\u000d\u000a      Stanley, Miller and\u000d\u000a      Thomson in collaboration with researchers from the University of Hull.\u000d\u000a      This was the first\u000d\u000a      study of its kind to be undertaken with men in the general population in\u000d\u000a      the UK.

An\u000d\u000a      evaluation [5] of the work of the service was undertaken by a research\u000d\u000a      team led by Stanley\u000d\u000a      and including Graham-Kevan, School of Psychology, UCLan.\u000d\u000a    A research review [6] of children's experiences of domestic violence\u000d\u000a      aimed at Directors of\u000d\u000a      Children's Services placed UK research in the context of international\u000d\u000a      literature, highlighted\u000d\u000a      the focus on mothers which acts to exclude fathers and identified gaps in\u000d\u000a      knowledge and\u000d\u000a      services.

Bilson's recommendation to\u000d\u000a      OAK Foundation led to a grant of $500,000 to establish the Know How Centre\u000d\u000a      on Alternatives to Care for Children at the New Bulgarian University which\u000d\u000a      supports the government's implementation of deinstitutionalisation and\u000d\u000a      disseminates good practice. He continues as international consultant\u000d\u000a      having co-led a team evaluating the early institutional closures to\u000d\u000a      identify good practice, using the toolkit developed from.Bilson and Westwood's literature review. Bilson is leading one section of\u000d\u000a      the Centre's &#8364;900,000 project to establish and evaluate models for\u000d\u000a      preventative services in two Roma communities [Contact 1].\u000d\u000a    Examples of the reach of this research include Bilson's current work\u000d\u000a      helping the Ugandan government develop a vision for social care [Contact\u000d\u000a      2] and in Lithuania where, following national newspaper coverage of his\u000d\u000a      key speech at Kaunas university, Bilson made a presentation in Parliament\u000d\u000a      (broadcast on the internet with extracts on national television) to the\u000d\u000a      Minister of Justice and other government and presidential advisers. This\u000d\u000a      stimulated wide public debate on institutionalisation. Bilson also\u000d\u000a      supported Gelb&#279;kit Vaikus (Save the Children) in establishing the first\u000d\u000a      pilot projects to implement gatekeeping entry to institutions in 15\u000d\u000a      municipalities. The government has made a commitment to close all its\u000d\u000a      large institutions, and Bilson continues to support this, including giving\u000d\u000a      a presentation to the deputy minister and advisory team responsible on\u000d\u000a      5\/8\/2013 [Contact 3].\u000d\u000a    The Evaluation of Social Work Practices has achieved significance and\u000d\u000a      reach of impact in determining both the form and shape of the `second\u000d\u000a      wave' of SWPs in children's and adults services and the long-term future\u000d\u000a      of this model. Senior DfE officers noted that the Evaluation contributed\u000d\u000a      to Government policy on SWPs and to cabinet policy on mutuals, the `right\u000d\u000a      to challenge' and `right to provide'. The evaluation identified the\u000d\u000a      weaknesses of the SWP model and provided messages for future contracting\u000d\u000a      out of children's services. These officers noted that the evaluation\u000d\u000a      highlighted the central role of local authorities in supporting SWPs and\u000d\u000a      found that most SWPs never achieved full independence. As a consequence of\u000d\u000a      the Evaluation, future government policy was described as more likely to\u000d\u000a      focus on contracting out rather than `spinning off' children's services\u000d\u000a      [Contact 4]. The DfE consultation [F] on the future of SWPs cited the\u000d\u000a      `mixed findings' of the evaluation and proposed arrangements offering\u000d\u000a      local authorities flexibility to delegate social care functions to SWP\u000d\u000a      providers should they choose to do so. At the time of writing, Government\u000d\u000a      is developing regulations to permit this and the evaluation has been cited\u000d\u000a      in both the Government consultation on these regulations and in UNISON's\u000d\u000a      response to it. The optional nature of these proposals contrasts\u000d\u000a      significantly with government plans for the probation service which is\u000d\u000a      being substantially privatised; this reflects the significant impact of\u000d\u000a      UCLan's evaluation.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study describes the impact of research on new approaches to the\u000d\u000a      organisation and delivery of social work services for children in\u000d\u000a      out-of-home care, with international work led by Bilson and work in\u000d\u000a      England involving Stanley, Bilson, Larkins and Ridley.

Bilson has\u000d\u000a      also carried out a review of social work in Uganda leading to a Government\u000d\u000a      plan for developing social care.\u000d\u000a    Bilson, Ridley and Larkins were members of the team led by Stanley that,\u000d\u000a      in partnership with researchers from King's College London and Institute\u000d\u000a      of Education, undertook the evaluation of Social Work Practice (SWP)\u000d\u000a      pilots [4] for the Department for Education. The evaluation was\u000d\u000a      underpinned by the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 which required that\u000d\u000a      the pilots be evaluated and made provision for the roll-out of SWPs\u000d\u000a      subject to the evaluation findings. The study used a matched control\u000d\u000a      design with integral process evaluation and identified the strengths and\u000d\u000a      challenges of the SWP model as implemented. While some pilots were found\u000d\u000a      to provide user- friendly services and examples of positive practice, the\u000d\u000a      pilots failed to consistently achieve continuity for looked after\u000d\u000a      children, and did not out-perform comparison sites on all outcomes. The\u000d\u000a      evaluation reported that the SWPs remained dependent on local authorities\u000d\u000a      for a range of services and concluded that SWPs were unlikely to replace\u000d\u000a      the functions of local authority children's services. The evaluation\u000d\u000a      findings have been disseminated through a series of peer reviewed papers\u000d\u000a      [5, 6] and through national and international presentations to\u000d\u000a      practitioner, policy and research audiences hosted by organisations such\u000d\u000a      as Making Research Count, BAAF and Social Services Research Group. The\u000d\u000a      study received coverage in the professional and national press and in the\u000d\u000a      influential Munro Report (2011) and the reach of the research has been\u000d\u000a      extended by invited lectures at the University of Melbourne and Griffith\u000d\u000a      University.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2800","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aEarly research analyses by Spandler, Ridley and Newbigging served to highlight gaps and\u000d\u000ainequalities in provision, and barriers and facilitators to increasing uptake of DPs. All of the cited\u000d\u000aresearch was commissioned by, and designed to meet the needs of, government policy makers in\u000d\u000aEngland and\/or Scotland, and as such was used by them to develop policy or law. The work\u000d\u000acontributed a more nuanced understanding of the potential, as well as the limits, of progressive\u000d\u000asocial policies.\u000d\u000aResearch in 2002 (Ridley 2006), which identified the importance of publicity and information to\u000d\u000aincrease uptake, was used by the Scottish Executive with Scottish local authorities to promote\u000d\u000astrategies to improve DP uptake in mental health. The numbers of people with mental health\u000d\u000aproblems receiving a DP in Scotland increased from six in 2002 to over 500 in 2012. In England,\u000d\u000aSpandler's action research provided detailed case studies that have been used to directly tackle\u000d\u000athe pervading scepticism that DPs are possible in mental health, thereby contributing to improved\u000d\u000aaccess and takeup. For example, case studies were used in presentations and workshops\u000d\u000adelivered by the leads for DPs in mental health at CSIP National Institute for Mental Health in\u000d\u000aEngland (NIMHE) (Contact 2). Examples from the research were referred to in the NIMHE\/Dept of\u000d\u000aHealth document Direct Payments and Mental Health: A Guide To Action (DH 2006). Case studies\u000d\u000afrom the research (eg the example of service users pooling their DPs to pay for a creative arts\u000d\u000aworker in a community centre) are regularly cited nationally as examples of good practice &#8212; in text\u000d\u000abooks (Gardner 2012), by the DH (2006), by national organisations like Mind (Heslop and Williams\u000d\u000a2009, Heslop 2010) and in regional and national training events by appointed `Personalisation\u000d\u000aLeads', service user organisations and SCIE (Contacts 3 and 4). A Joseph Rowntree Foundation\u000d\u000agrant was awarded to directly build on the study's findings and investigate stakeholder\u000d\u000aperspectives on implementation with a particular focus on BME communities. Illustrative case\u000d\u000astudies from the research (Newbigging and Lowe 2005) were used in subsequent JRF reports\u000d\u000aproviding real life examples for training. Spandler's critique of DPs has been influential in\u000d\u000abroadening knowledge and awareness around the limitations of DPs. It has been drawn upon and\u000d\u000adeveloped by more recent critiques and debates about personalisation, and used to suggest\u000d\u000aalternative ways forward (91 citations including Lyons 2005, Foster et al. 2006, Ferguson 2007).\u000d\u000aFor example, it is regularly used in HE social work and social policy national curricula and her work\u000d\u000awas referred to specifically by DH Putting People First Team to consider how to embed\u000d\u000apersonalisation within the social work curriculum nationally. Her work has also been used to build\u000d\u000aupon more recent critiques of, and debates about, personalisation and to suggest alternative ways\u000d\u000aforward (over 40 citations including Lyons 2005, Foster et al. 2006, Ferguson 2007, Dodd 2013). It\u000d\u000ais also regularly used in HE curricula for social work and social policy teaching (Leece and Bornat\u000d\u000a2006, Gardner 2011). This work, therefore, has had conceptual and socio-political impact in\u000d\u000arelation to social policy critique.\u000d\u000aNewbigging's work was innovative in focusing on the opportunities to promote culturally sensitive\u000d\u000aprovision and identify the specific barriers faced by people from BME communities in accessing\u000d\u000aand using DPs. It has provided a focus for engagement with local authorities and local community\u000d\u000aorganisations, for example in identifying action at a local level to promote uptake through the West\u000d\u000aMidlands Delivering Race Equality programme and cited in relevant equality impact assessments\u000d\u000a(e.g. in relation to Putting People First). The findings were noted by the Future Vision Coalition for\u000d\u000amental health (a partnership between the NHS Confederation, Local Government Association and\u000d\u000anational mental health voluntary sector organisations) in promoting their vision for the future of\u000d\u000amental health care (Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2006).\u000d\u000aThe evaluation of SDS test sites in Scotland (Ridley, Spandler et al. 2012) met a very specific need\u000d\u000aof the Scottish Government for evidence to contribute to current policy making. The Scottish\u000d\u000aGovernment Strategy Implementation Group in 2011 considered the learning from the evaluation\u000d\u000aabout the use of tools and processes for matching Individual Budgets (IBs) to meeting positive\u000d\u000aoutcomes and has incorporated this in a questionnaire now used to routinely gather information\u000d\u000afrom all Scottish local authorities about implementation of SDS policy. Ridley was invited by\u000d\u000aScottish Parliament during 2012 to give evidence to the Health and Sports Committee considering\u000d\u000apassage of the SDS Bill, which was televised and a written report produced (Scottish Parliament\u000d\u000a2012). Key findings regarding the evolving concept of SDS as more than DPs, and the related\u000d\u000adifficulty in measuring SDS options especially when support is selected for the individual, were\u000d\u000anoted; this has been clarified in subsequent legislation (Social Care (SDS) (Scotland) Act 2013)\u000d\u000aand Scottish Government work with local authorities on national data collection (Contact 1).\u000d\u000aThe SDS Policy Team in Scottish Government made direct reference to the research in the\u000d\u000alegislative Bill for Scotland, which Scottish Parliament accepted as the Social Care (SDS)\u000d\u000a(Scotland) Act in January 2013. The Strategy Implementation Group incorporated lessons from the\u000d\u000atest sites evaluation in its implementation timeline up to 2015. In this respect, the research directly\u000d\u000aimpacted on the work of policy makers at governmental level, on increasing awareness and\u000d\u000aunderstanding of practitioners in local authorities and voluntary organisations, and ultimately\u000d\u000a(though this is harder to measure) on the individuals who receive social care support who will be\u000d\u000athe beneficiaries of the learning from the test sites (Contact 1).\u000d\u000aScottish Government launched the findings from the first evaluation to all 32 local authorities in\u000d\u000aScotland in September 2011 and sent a press release to Directors of Social Work. The event was\u000d\u000achaired by the Director of the Institute for Research in Social Services (IRISS), whose mission is to\u000d\u000apromote positive outcomes for people who use Scotland's social services by enhancing the\u000d\u000acapacity and capability of the workforce to access and make use of knowledge and research, thus\u000d\u000awidening the reach of this work. IRISS has actively promoted this and the follow up evaluation\u000d\u000areport amongst its members and through its website for example, a radio interview with Ridley has\u000d\u000abeen posted and links to the Scottish Government website thus increasing dissemination of\u000d\u000afindings to health and social care professionals. Ridley has been invited onto an Expert Group to\u000d\u000aadvise on a high level national project, PilotLight, to further promote SDS and improve outcomes\u000d\u000a(Contact 1).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis case study concerns a body of research by Dr Julie Ridley, Dr Helen Spandler and Dr Karen\u000d\u000aNewbigging into Self-directed Support (SDS) and Direct Payments (DPs), which examines\u000d\u000aperspectives and experiences of policies to promote choice, control and flexibility in social care,\u000d\u000aand provides a critique distinguishing between rhetoric and reality.

A study for the Scottish Executive in 2002 (Ridley, 2006) examined the feasibility of DPs for\u000d\u000amental health service users given the extremely low uptake. It identified scepticism about DPs\u000d\u000aamong service users and carers as well as mental health professionals, but also an interest to\u000d\u000aincrease uptake of DPs among some participants in mental health user groups. Subsequent action\u000d\u000aresearch for the Dept. of Health in 2003\/4 (Spandler and Vick, 2005; 2006) illustrated how, contrary\u000d\u000ato popular belief, people with mental health needs could, given adequate support, use DPs in\u000d\u000acreative ways. A subsequent project commissioned by Joseph Rowntree Foundation from\u000d\u000aNewbigging and Lowe (2005) built on this research to engage with mental health service users and\u000d\u000aprofessionals to examine barriers to implementation and identify potential ways of overcoming\u000d\u000athese, particularly for people from black and minority ethnic communities. This, along with the\u000d\u000aresearch undertaken by Spandler and Vick, provided a foundation for guidance to the field\u000d\u000aproduced by the National Institute for Mental Health England. A later project for MIND (Heslop,\u000d\u000aWilliams and Spandler 2009) sought to further improve uptake by demonstrating what was\u000d\u000aachievable. Spandler was also involved in a large scale study of the uptake of DPs across care\u000d\u000agroups as part of the national Modernising Adult Social Care (MASC) research programme (Vick et\u000d\u000aal 2006).

The research questioned the\u000d\u000avalidity of calling assessment `self-assessment' when most assessments were largely shaped by\u000d\u000acarers' and\/or professionals' views, and showed how the extent of choice, flexibility and control is\u000d\u000ain part determined by professionals' knowledge and skills in implementing SDS, as well as by the\u000d\u000aresources at their disposal.

Through the\u000a      prominence of the work of the EMILIA project, Middlesex University\u000a      (represented by Peter Ryan) was invited to take part as a member of the\u000a      steering committee for this initiative. The WHO statement described the\u000a      challenges, and identified the perspectives and the elements that comprise\u000a      empowerment, and suggested proposed actions to promote empowerment in\u000a      mental health (1).\u000a    Subsequent research by the steering committee was presented at the EU\u000a      Thematic Conference on Social Inclusion and Combatting Stigma for Mental\u000a      Health (Lisbon, 8-9 Nov. 2010) (2) and the core recommendations of this\u000a      group were accepted for `horizontal action' (3), and later developed into\u000a      guidelines for the training of health and social care professionals in\u000a      mental health promotion across the European Union Member States (4).\u000a    ii) Knowledge Transfer: Impact on the profession and mental health\u000a        service users The research on service user empowerment and lifelong\u000a      learning was disseminated at conferences in 16 European countries: Bosnia,\u000a      Netherlands, Malta, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Ireland,\u000a      France, Spain, Slovenia, Lithuania, UK, Greece and Italy. These\u000a      conferences identified training and service development approaches as\u000a      positive mechanisms for promoting organisational and institutional change.\u000a      Our research was specifically used as the evidence base for organisational\u000a      change across Europe within 8 demonstration sites [See: (7) Flores et. al\u000a      2009].\u000a    The EMILIA project found that partner universities and health care\u000a      centres benefited from the knowledge and experience of mental health\u000a      service users and, based on this finding, systematically restructured\u000a      their strategic and operational decision-making processes to include the\u000a      views and opinions of these service users. The universities involved also\u000a      took on board the findings and subsequently included service users in the\u000a      planning and delivery of their educational programmes [See: (5): Flores et\u000a      al (2010); and (6) Greacen &amp; Jouet 2009]. The impact of this research\u000a      on the profession has been noted in several European countries including\u000a      Greece (8), Poland (10) and Slovenia (11).\u000a    Since the conclusion of the project, the research findings were used to\u000a      underpin the development of innovative ways to address empowerment among\u000a      partner service organisations. The findings have been disseminated even\u000a      further through the 250 registered subscriber organisations on the EMILIA\u000a      website, based in 43 countries. The impact of this research can now be\u000a      seen across the profession, across Europe and beyond. For example:\u000a    a) service users are now represented on the regional executive mental\u000a      health planning council in Bodo, Norway;\u000a    b) in North East Paris, the continuous professional development training\u000a      course offered by Maison Blanche, is now open to service users;\u000a    c) in Zealand, Denmark, mental health service users are now trained as\u000a      peer medication mentors.\u000a    The role of our research in influencing these changes can be corroborated\u000a      by WHO Europe's Mental Health Adviser Dr Matt Muijen; Tim Greacon,\u000a      director of Research at Maison Blanche; and Ian Dawson, Quality Care\u000a      Coodinator in Bodo, Norway.

As part of the evaluation, Ryan\u000a      commissioned the UK's first independent service user led research on case\u000a      management. Ryan and his research group (Griffiths, Hamilton, Machin,\u000a      Wilks) produced a report which identified the impact of case management on\u000a      policy and practice, highlighting the significance of a user empowerment\u000a      approach to case management (Ryan 1999). A key issue to emerge from this\u000a      work was the lack of empowerment of mental health service users with\u000a      severe long-term difficulties (Griffiths &amp; Ryan 2008).\u000a    In 2005 a team at Middlesex University led by Ryan (as Field Leader and\u000a      Project Coordinator) and Griffiths, developed and coordinated a major\u000a      Europe-wide mental health research project, funded under Framework 6,\u000a      entitled EMILIA. One of the major innovations of EMILIA was that it\u000a      employed the concept and practices of lifelong learning to facilitate the\u000a      social inclusion of mental health service users. In doing this, it also\u000a      attempted to integrate European policy in four areas: lifelong learning,\u000a      social inclusion, employment and information technology. The project\u000a      focused on challenging organisational and institutional barriers to the\u000a      development of service user empowerment and, in particular, the\u000a      contribution of lifelong learning to this process. The project's aim was\u000a      to improve user participation and inclusion in the delivery of services or\u000a      in education and training. The project was funded for five years\u000a      (2005-2010), to a value of &#8364;3.4 million, and involved 18 mental health\u000a      institutions across Europe. This funding was designed to create a\u000a      `critical mass of influence on policy and practice' across Europe (http:\/\/www.emiliaproject.net\/).\u000a    The project recruited adults with severe and enduring mental illness\u000a      (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), in contact with mental health\u000a      services for at least three years and who were not in paid employment.\u000a      They were offered a series of training modules with other service users,\u000a      and opportunities for employment or significant activities within the\u000a      demonstration sites as well as connection to potential employers outside\u000a      the project sites. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation took\u000a      place at eight demonstration sites (Athens, Barcelona, Bod&#248;, London,\u000a      Paris, Tuzla, Warsaw, Zealand) at baseline, ten months and twenty months,\u000a      of their socio-demographic status, take up of the training and of unpaid\u000a      and paid employment, own evaluation of the impact of participation in the\u000a      project in relation to employment, social interaction, training\u000a      activities, opportunities and obstacles, and goals for the near future, as\u000a      well as related organisational changes in the demonstration sites.\u000a    The EMILIA project identified the need for service user empowerment in\u000a      the mental health services involved in the project and suggested how the\u000a      training could be replicated in different European settings (Ancezewska\u000a      &amp; Ryan 2009). The research provides evidence that service user\u000a      empowerment is positively correlated with enhanced self esteem, increased\u000a      social inclusion, enhanced employment levels and reduced use of\u000a      psychiatric in- patient services (Ryan, Ramon &amp; Greacen (2012). Key\u000a      findings after 20 months include:\u000a    i. a doubling of paid employment from 7.3 to 14.6 per cent and a similar\u000a      increase for voluntary employment;\u000a    ii. significant increases in disposable income and quality of life with\u000a      an increase in the average number of hours per week worked from 0.3 to\u000a      3.23;\u000a    iii. an average reduction of days in psychiatric hospital from 14 to 7;\u000a    iv. a self-reported increase in levels of self-confidence, efficacy and\u000a      hope, and increased skills and knowledge leading to increased\u000a      employability.\u000a    Numerous publications resulted from the project (e.g. Griffiths 2009;\u000a      Ramon, Ryan, Urek, 2010). (For a list of the project partners see Dermenti\u000a      2010). The success of EMILIA led to further EU funding: PROMISE (2009\u000a      -2012) (http:\/\/promise-mental-health.com\/).\u000a      The focus of this project was to develop and evaluate ways in which mental\u000a      health service users could be empowered to play a full part in the design\u000a      and development of mental health training across all the main professions\u000a      involved in delivering mental health services to people experiencing\u000a      severe and enduring mental health problems: psychiatry, clinical\u000a      psychology, nursing and social work. The unit's key contribution was the\u000a      use of Antonovsky's `sense of coherence' as a measure which was able to\u000a      detect changes among service users.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3259","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    This case study involves two levels of impact: i) the impact that our\u000d      research has had in providing evidence for Save the Children UK to launch\u000d      a UK roll-out of FAST and ii) the evidence for replicability has shaped\u000d      the programme design leading to improved impacts of the programme on\u000d      families. Governments in many countries have recognised the importance of\u000d      supporting families with young children, particularly those on low income\u000d      and from disadvantaged and socially marginalised groups. However, they\u000d      also require research evidence in order to make choices about which\u000d      particular programmes to endorse or fund. Increasingly governments and\u000d      other funders look to the published lists of `evidence based' programmes,\u000d      tested in randomised controlled trials, to inform their strategic\u000d      decisions. In order to identify and support evidence-based programmes,\u000d      researchers, including those at Middlesex, have developed such evidence.\u000d      However, our own work goes a stage further in having identified the\u000d      transferable features of these programmes which lead to high levels of\u000d      participation and low levels of drop-out on the part of socially excluded\u000d      families. In the challenges of `scaling up' such programmes, we have met\u000d      the strategic need on the part of funders for predictable rates of\u000d      completion and consistent child outcomes across diverse settings. This is\u000d      over and above RCT evidence of programme effectiveness, based on studies\u000d      conducted in the US.\u000d    In 2009 Save the Children UK decided to adopt one evidence-based\u000d      parenting programme that was focussed on low-income children and schools.\u000d      They requested the Institute of Education (IoE) to review available\u000d      research on evidence-based parenting programmes and the IoE recommended\u000d      FAST, among 7 programmes, based on the quality of the existing evidence.\u000d      Save the Children subsequently chose FAST as a result of this evidence\u000d      base and funded a pilot programme in five low-income communities across\u000d      the UK. Our research into drop-out rates in these sites then provided the\u000d      research intelligence required by this charity in its decision-making to\u000d      adopt FAST across the UK with funding from the commercial sector.\u000d    A crucial part of their decision to fund was the evidence which indicated\u000d      not only that FAST was effective on a number of measures but it also led\u000d      to consistently high rates of completion. Whilst other parenting\u000d      programmes have been supported by evidence of effectiveness, only our\u000d      research, to date, adds evidence to improve programme replication,\u000d      evidence which programme funders require to make decisions about the large\u000d      scale roll out of any project. Save the Children supported 15 FAST\u000d      projects in 14 primary schools across the UK between April 2010 and August\u000d      2011. Some 338 families attended at least once and 80% of those families\u000d      attended at least six of the eight sessions and completed the programme.\u000d      Approximately 85% of families attending had an annual family income of\u000d      under &#163;20,000. The evidence of low attrition rate is the first level of\u000d      impact we present here.\u000d    The end beneficiaries are children aged 3-8 and families, schools and\u000d      communities, with a focus on low income and disadvantaged and socially\u000d      marginalised groups. Our evaluations employing outcome measures with\u000d      established reliability and validity have guided the design of the\u000d      programme roll out. These include: the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS)\u000d      and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) with subscales for social skills,\u000d      aggression, and academic performance. Using these measures, the programme\u000d      has been shown in evaluations (see first reference in Section 5) to\u000d      deliver the following outcomes:\u000d    Parent outcomes:\u000d    \u000d      Increased parental involvement in schools and increased social\u000d        capital; improved parent to parent support networks, increased parent\u000d        community leadership\u000d      At two-year follow-up, 86-90 per cent of parents who have completed\u000d        the programme report continued improved parent to parent support\u000d        networks\u000d      Improved parent-child bonds.\u000d    \u000d    Child outcomes:\u000d    \u000d      Positive child mental health outcomes and increased social skills;\u000d        improved academic and school behaviour; reduced aggression and anxiety\u000d      Parents report small to medium decrease in children's externalizing\u000d        behaviours\u000d      Teachers report a large decrease in children's externalizing\u000d        behaviours and small to medium improvements in academic performance\u000d      Decreased family conflict\u000d      Reduced aggressive and delinquent behaviours after eight weeks; both\u000d        that result and academic outcomes were maintained after two years\u000d    \u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The education gap between children from poor homes and their peers is\u000d      established before they start primary school.

In 2011, Wray addressed about 40 immigration lawyers at a meeting convened by the\u000d\u000aImmigration Law Practitioners Association and in 2013 at the Migrants' Rights' Network (MRN)\u000d\u000aAnnual Summit (5.1), addressing about 100 activists.

This dissemination has made a significant contribution to\u000d\u000acampaigns and debates inside and outside Parliament which is creating considerable momentum\u000d\u000afor reform of the rule (see below).\u000d\u000aParliamentary impact: Based on their work, Kofman and Wray made a joint submission on the\u000d\u000anew income requirement to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Migration (APPG) in its Family\u000d\u000aMigration Enquiry. In March 2013, Wray gave oral evidence to the Enquiry at the House of\u000d\u000aCommons and its quality was singled out for praise by its Chair, Baroness Hamwee (5.5). Their\u000d\u000asubmission was cited at several points in the Enquiry Report (June 2013) and received widespread\u000d\u000apublicity. In addition, the essential points of their evidence were put into a joint briefing with\u000d\u000aMinority Rights Network which was circulated to all MPs ahead of a Westminster Hall debate on\u000d\u000a19th June 2013. Kate Green, MP Stretford and Urmston, made extensive use of the evidence\u000d\u000aduring her contribution to the debate (5.6). The briefing was later circulated to Peers ahead of a\u000d\u000aLords debate on 4th July 2013 and formed the basis of a press release timed to coincide with a\u000d\u000anational demonstration and parliamentary meeting on 9th July. There is evidence of growing\u000d\u000apolitical pressure to amend the rule (http:\/\/www.migrantsrights.org.uk\/blog\/2013\/09\/tide-beginning-turn-family-migration).\u000d\u000aImpact on court proceedings: The first set of expert reports and witness statements, on the\u000d\u000acompatibility of pre-entry language testing with human rights, was submitted in the case of Chapti.\u000d\u000aThis high profile test case was argued not only by the parties but by JCWI and the civil liberties\u000d\u000aorganisation, Liberty, whose counsel, relied on the report in their submissions (5.7). Wray was\u000d\u000athanked by the lawyers involved for the quality of her work which in particular underpinned a key\u000d\u000aargument relating to the nature of discrimination in this situation (5.8). Although the initial judgment\u000d\u000afound against the claimants in this regard as did the majority of the Court of Appeal (Bibi v SSHD),\u000d\u000ain a dissenting judgment, Keene LJ, took a different view and relied on Wray's evidence to find\u000d\u000athat the Government had not met its obligations to show the necessity of the rule and therefore its\u000d\u000acompliance with human rights. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been sought and there\u000d\u000ais a good possibility that the question of the weight to be attached to expert evidence in cases of\u000d\u000athis kind will form the basis of a decision by the UK's highest domestic court as to the lawfulness of\u000d\u000athe pre-entry language test and therefore its applicability to thousands of spousal migrants entering\u000d\u000athe UK.\u000d\u000aThe judgement on MM and Ors vs SSHD, delivered on 5 July 2013, found that the combination of\u000d\u000athe new regulations was disproportionate, unjust and unduly harsh for a wide range of the\u000d\u000apopulation, especially young people, women and those on low incomes and would therefore\u000d\u000abreach article 8 ECHR in many cases. The judgment drew in many places on the findings and\u000d\u000aarguments in our expert report (5.8).\u000d\u000aImpact on Family Migrant Sponsors and Spouses: In response to the MM judgment, the Home\u000d\u000aOffice called a pause in the decision making of applications pending its appeal against the\u000d\u000ajudgment. If the judgment is upheld by the higher courts, the government will be required, under\u000d\u000athe Human Rights Act, either to change the law or to legislate and risk an unfavourable judgment in\u000d\u000athe European Court of Human Rights. In the meantime, the findings in the judgement on article 8\u000d\u000aincompatibility in most cases is assisting many applicants whose claims have already been\u000d\u000arejected because they do not meet the income threshold to appeal their individual claims\u000d\u000asuccessfully (http:\/\/www.freemovement.org.uk\/2013\/07\/22\/hope-for-families-divided-by-the-income-threshold\/#more-9205).\u000d\u000aImpact on European policy: Kofman's report on family reunion legislation in Europe was relied on\u000d\u000aby the European Women's Lobby (EWL), the largest non-governmental umbrella organisation of\u000d\u000asome 2000 women's associations in the European Union and the European Network of Migrant\u000d\u000aWomen (ENoMW) &#8212; a European network of more than 100 non-governmental and non-profit\u000d\u000aorganisations from 16 European Union states in their response to the European Commission\u000d\u000aGreen Paper on the Right to Family Reunification of Third Country Nationals Living in the\u000d\u000aEuropean Union  (Directive 2003\/86\/EC).

This work set the framework for subsequent investigation by\u000d\u000aother migration scholars and she was subsequently invited to collaborate in research projects\u000d\u000afunded by the Austrian Ministry of Research (NODE Programme - New Orientations for Democracy\u000d\u000ain Europe) (1) and the EU Integration Fund (2). These investigated the formulation of and strategic\u000d\u000aresponses to family migration controls throughout Europe, particularly in their discriminatory effects\u000d\u000aon women. On the basis of these studies, she wrote a report for the European Women's Lobby (3),\u000d\u000ato be used in their response to the consultation on a potential redrafting of the EU Family\u000d\u000aReunification Directive in 2011.\u000d\u000aWray has been working on the regulation of family migration since the mid-2000s. Her focus has\u000d\u000abeen the relationship between policy aims and legislative change and the role of the courts in\u000d\u000adetermining the limits of government control over family migration. Her article `An Ideal Husband'\u000d\u000a(4) analysed the inadequate evidential basis for government policy that dramatically interfered with\u000d\u000athe ability of migrants to marry in the UK. Her subsequent work (5) has deepened and extended\u000d\u000athe range of this analysis.\u000d\u000aWray's experience of critical policy analysis led to her being invited in 2011 to provide expert\u000d\u000aevidence in a judicial review of a new rule which required incoming spouses to take an English\u000d\u000alanguage test before entry. Leading a team of three (Charsley, Clift and Jordan, not at Middlesex),\u000d\u000ashe drew on her knowledge of the academic literature and her skills and experience of policy\u000d\u000aanalysis to write a lengthy expert report and witness statements for the proceedings.

Wray et al's report\u000d\u000ashowed that the test would not confer the linguistic benefits claimed for it and that there were\u000d\u000aserious practical issues involved in its implementation that would make it much more difficult for\u000d\u000aspouses from some countries to gain entry.\u000d\u000aNew regulations for family migration from 9 July 2012, especially the income requirement of\u000d\u000a&#163;18,600 per annum for sponsors, have had a discriminatory impact on the ability of British citizens\u000d\u000aand residents to live in the UK with their partners. It was estimated that 61% of British women in\u000d\u000aiemployment would be unable to bring in spouses (Oxford Migration Observatory). Applications fell\u000d\u000afrom 25,664 in the 6 months preceding the introduction of the rule to 10,854 in the 6 months after,\u000d\u000aand with a much higher rate of rejection, especially for women.

It has\u000d\u000a      had a powerful impact on policy responses to demographic change\u000d\u000a      internationally, nationally and\u000d\u000a      locally resulting in significant policy change. It has also led to policy\u000d\u000a      changes by national NGOs. In\u000d\u000a      some cases it has prompted a step-change in organisational approaches.\u000d\u000a    International Policy\u000d\u000a    From 1999 to 2002, Walker assisted the WHO in developing its Active\u000d\u000a      Ageing Policy Framework\u000d\u000a      and, according to the then Director of the WHO's Programme on Ageing, was\u000d\u000a      `one of the most\u000d\u000a      influential and informed sources'. From 2000 to 2001, Walker was a member\u000d\u000a      of the technical\u000d\u000a      committee preparing the UN's second plan on ageing, the 2002 Madrid\u000d\u000a      International Plan of Action\u000d\u000a      on Ageing (MIPAA). He was also engaged by the UN to draft the final\u000d\u000a      document prior to\u000d\u000a      submission to the General Assembly. The concept of active ageing is core\u000d\u000a      to this document [S1].\u000d\u000a    In 2008, a collaboration began between the University of Sherbrook in\u000d\u000a      Quebec and seven\u000d\u000a      municipalities. Funded by the provincial government, the action research\u000d\u000a      project Age-friendly Cities\u000d\u000a      in Quebec (AFC-QC) now involves well over 500 localities, covering more\u000d\u000a      than 70 per cent of the\u000d\u000a      Quebec population. According to the Directors of AFC-QC the new concept of\u000d\u000a      active ageing\u000d\u000a      developed by Walker is the theoretical basis and model for this\u000d\u000a      collaboration. Community and\u000d\u000a      government stakeholders use this model to frame their policy and practice\u000d\u000a      responses to ageing. It\u000d\u000a      is used explicitly and promoted on the Age-friendly Cities project website\u000d\u000a      (www.madaquebec.ca\/)\u000d\u000a      which itself is the gateway to the 500 plus municipalities implementing\u000d\u000a      this approach. Then, in\u000d\u000a      spring 2012 the Quebec Government launched its first strategy on ageing,\u000d\u000a      which also relies on\u000d\u000a      Walker's model [S2].\u000d\u000a    National Policy\u000d\u000a    In 2004 Walker presented an early version of his model of active ageing\u000d\u000a      and the research on which\u000d\u000a      it is based to the Prime Minister, other ministers and advisors titled `An\u000d\u000a      Opportunity Society for All\u000d\u000a      Ages'. A text based on his presentation formed the basis for the Labour\u000d\u000a      Party's `Mini-manifesto' on\u000d\u000a      older people in the 2005 General Election and also fed into the national\u000d\u000a      strategy on ageing\u000d\u000a      Opportunity Age (DWP, 2005). A version was published in a report\u000d\u000a      for the Department for\u000d\u000a      Communities and Local Government [S3].\u000d\u000a    National charities\/NGOs have adopted Walker's model, for example Age UK\u000d\u000a      and the Third Age\u000d\u000a      Employment Network (TAEN). The creation of Age UK in 2008, following the\u000d\u000a      merger of Age\u000d\u000a      Concern and Help the Aged, led to a long period of policy development and\u000d\u000a      root and branch\u000d\u000a      reappraisal of the existing strategies of the two previously separate\u000d\u000a      organisations. The Age UK\u000d\u000a      Research Director was invited to join the NDA Commissioning Panel as a\u000d\u000a      user representative, and\u000d\u000a      a strategic partnership was created between the NGO and the Programme in\u000d\u000a      which the two would\u000d\u000a      collaborate on knowledge transfer activities. In March 2012 Walker gave\u000d\u000a      the opening keynote to\u000d\u000a      the Age UK `Agenda for Later Life' Conference and in October, he addressed\u000d\u000a      the Trustees' away\u000d\u000a      day. As a result of these inputs and considerable prior engagement the\u000d\u000a      charity has re-assessed its\u000d\u000a      approach on various levels and adopted Walker's model. In the words of the\u000d\u000a      Charity Director\u000d\u000a      General of Age UK: `Professor Alan Walker's work and that of the NDA\u000d\u000a        Programme has provided\u000d\u000a        much of the conceptual framework that Age UK has adopted in its\u000d\u000a        corporate strategy, research,\u000d\u000a        policy development and service development. We have taken Professor\u000d\u000a        Walker's concept of active\u000d\u000a        ageing and applied it to all that we do. It has a huge impact and\u000d\u000a        application at the Country's largest\u000d\u000a        older people's charity' [S4].\u000d\u000a    TAEN is a national NGO campaigning against age discrimination in\u000d\u000a      employment. It has drawn\u000d\u000a      extensively on Walker's model of active ageing. This impact includes\u000d\u000a      campaigns, particularly\u000d\u000a      around age management, professional guidance and lobbying. For example,\u000d\u000a      according to TAEN\u000d\u000a      Chief Executive: `our introductory guide to age management for HR\u000d\u000a        professionals, the many\u000d\u000a        seminars and presentations as well as innumerable blogs, magazine\u000d\u000a        articles and presentations at\u000d\u000a        workshops in this country and abroad have drawn energy and inspiration\u000d\u000a        from your work' [S5].\u000d\u000a      Specific examples of research that has been particularly helpful to this\u000d\u000a      NGO include the paradox\u000d\u000a      between trends in retirement and life expectancy (Walker, 2002) and the\u000d\u000a      case studies of age\u000d\u000a      management strategies (Naegele and Walker, 2006). Again, in the words of\u000d\u000a      TAEN Chief\u000d\u000a      Executive: `Our survey of the European chemical industry this year is\u000d\u000a        a case in point, as is my own\u000d\u000a        work on the Employment Experts Group of the Age Platform, our work in\u000d\u000a        the ESF Age Network,\u000d\u000a        other international collaborations, the information we have on our\u000d\u000a        website resources section for\u000d\u000a        employers and a recent paper for ACAS. All these and others are examples\u000d\u000a        where the solid ground\u000d\u000a        work you did continues to be relevant'. [S5].\u000d\u000a    The devolved government of Northern Ireland has adopted Walker's approach\u000d\u000a      to active ageing. In\u000d\u000a      June 2012 Walker was approached by the Commissioner for Older People for\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland to\u000d\u000a      provide advice on the development of a positive ageing strategy. He met\u000d\u000a      with the advisory group\u000d\u000a      on the development of the strategy (drawn from a wide range of interest\u000d\u000a      groups in the ageing field)\u000d\u000a      and with officials from the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister\u000d\u000a      (who were charged with\u000d\u000a      writing the strategy). He proposed a new approach based on active ageing\u000d\u000a      and the protection of\u000d\u000a      vulnerable older people. This was subsequently accepted and formed the\u000d\u000a      core of the draft strategy.\u000d\u000a      [S6].\u000d\u000a    After a period of public consultation the strategy was published in April\u000d\u000a      2013. According to the\u000d\u000a      Commissioner, Walker's input `led to a step change in the draft\u000d\u000a        strategy content'. He was also\u000d\u000a      thanked by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, Peter Robinson\u000d\u000a      and Martin McGuiness, in\u000d\u000a      a written answer in the Northern Ireland Assembly: `We have also\u000d\u000a        benefited greatly from the advice\u000d\u000a        of Alan Walker...and we would like to thank Professor Walker for his\u000d\u000a        input to the development of\u000d\u000a        the strategy, particularly on the importance of the Active Ageing\u000d\u000a        agenda' (AQO 2649\/11-15, 23\u000d\u000a      October 2012).\u000d\u000a    Local Policy\u000d\u000a    Walker's research has had a direct impact upon local policy in South\u000d\u000a      Yorkshire through his input\u000d\u000a      into the new policy framework on ageing `A City for ALL Ages &#8212; Making\u000d\u000a      Sheffield a Great Place to\u000d\u000a      Grow Old' [S7] which was officially adopted in September 2012. Walker's\u000d\u000a      approach to active\u000d\u000a      ageing is embedded throughout the policy document. The framework derives\u000d\u000a      from a city-wide\u000d\u000a      debate `Rethinking Age in Sheffield' attended by all of the major\u000d\u000a      stakeholders. Walker gave the\u000d\u000a      opening plenary lecture `Rethinking Ageing &#8212; Towards a City for ALL Ages'\u000d\u000a      and then embarked on\u000d\u000a      an intense process of policy development with the lead Council Officer. He\u000d\u000a      was invited to chair the\u000d\u000a      Implementation Board for the new framework. According to the Executive\u000d\u000a      Director for\u000d\u000a      Communities, SCC, `Alan Walker's ageing research and, in particular,\u000d\u000a        his work on active ageing,\u000d\u000a        have provided the basis for Sheffield's ageing strategy...and, therefore\u000d\u000a        will benefit thousands of\u000d\u000a        older people in the city, focusing not only on health and well-being but\u000d\u000a        also economic, transport,\u000d\u000a        housing and wider issues' [S7]. The Council Leader has also been\u000d\u000a      highly complementary about the\u000d\u000a      content of the framework and the planned approach. In achieving impact at\u000d\u000a      various policy levels\u000d\u000a      and in the practices of NGOs this research is also likely to have improved\u000d\u000a      the lives and well-being\u000d\u000a      of countless older people.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study shows how Alan Walker's internationally acclaimed\u000d\u000a      research on active ageing has\u000d\u000a      led to policy and practice changes locally, nationally and internationally\u000d\u000a      in response to what is\u000d\u000a      widely recognised as the grand societal challenge of population ageing.\u000d\u000a      Walker developed the\u000d\u000a      concept of active ageing which has been adopted by national governments in\u000d\u000a      Quebec and\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland, national charities and Sheffield City Council, leading\u000d\u000a      in each case to significant\u000d\u000a      policy change which is benefiting older people.

In the developed world this process began in earnest in the\u000d\u000a      1980s, partly in response\u000d\u000a      to the UN's first plan of action on ageing, while in less developed\u000d\u000a      countries this has only recently\u000d\u000a      started. In the UK the `New Labour' Government named demographic change as\u000d\u000a      one of its three\u000d\u000a      `grand challenges', with the EU giving it a similarly high status in, for\u000d\u000a      example, the 2000 Lisbon\u000d\u000a      Strategy and the current Horizon 2020 programme.

This comprised 24 projects, all\u000d\u000a      focused on the quality of\u000d\u000a      life in old age. Walker designed and directed the programme, shaping its\u000d\u000a      policy orientation and\u000d\u000a      developing active ageing as a core concept [R1, R2]. In 2004, this concept\u000d\u000a      was further developed\u000d\u000a      in EF research on age barriers in employment (2004-6, &#163;98,000). This\u000d\u000a      project collected and\u000d\u000a      analysed 160 case studies of organisations across Europe, including New\u000d\u000a      Member States in\u000d\u000a      Central and Eastern Europe. The resulting guide to good practice in age\u000d\u000a      management offered a\u000d\u000a      key resource for policy makers and human resources practitioners [R3]. In\u000d\u000a      2005 Walker was\u000d\u000a      appointed director of the first multi-disciplinary ageing research\u000d\u000a      programme &#8212; the New Dynamics of\u000d\u000a      Ageing (NDA). The largest of its kind ever mounted in the UK, this\u000d\u000a      programme developed out of\u000d\u000a      the earlier GO Programme and other parallel RCUK investments and was\u000d\u000a      co-funded by five\u000d\u000a      Research Councils (AHRC, BBSRC, EPSRC, ESRC, MRC, 2005, &#163;22m). It broke\u000d\u000a      entirely new\u000d\u000a      ground in understanding the ageing process and its implications for\u000d\u000a      policy, practice and product\u000d\u000a      development. Apart from designing the Programme's research agenda Walker's\u000d\u000a      roles involved\u000d\u000a      both research (eg. concept development, including active ageing and\u000d\u000a      multi-disciplinarity) and non-\u000d\u000a      academic user engagement.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers\u000d\u000a    The GO Programme was a collaboration between 40 researchers and 30\u000d\u000a      universities while the\u000d\u000a      NDA Programme involves 91 researchers and 67 universities. Walker directed\u000d\u000a      both of them. The\u000d\u000a      age barriers project was conducted jointly with Professor G. Naegele of\u000d\u000a      Dortmund University.\u000d\u000a    Originality and Significance\u000d\u000a    The unique contributions of the portfolio of Walker's research\u000d\u000a      underpinning this case study, apart\u000d\u000a      from the scientific ones across a wide range of disciplines, are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Creation of a new approach to ageing which embodies a life course\u000d\u000a        perspective, a preventative\u000d\u000a        orientation, a bottom-up empowering framework that is rooted in everyday\u000d\u000a        later life priorities,\u000d\u000a        and an inclusive account of active ageing which runs counter to the\u000d\u000a        popular images of activity\u000d\u000a        in later life and narrow productivist policy approaches.\u000d\u000a      A sociological understanding of the institutional construction of age\u000d\u000a        categories and age barriers\u000d\u000a        within organisations which opens up manifold possibilities for both\u000d\u000a        remedial and preventative\u000d\u000a        action.\u000d\u000a      An emerging new theory of ageing which combines insights from a wide\u000d\u000a        range of disciplines &#8212;\u000d\u000a        from biology to the humanities &#8212; and which rejects limited age\u000d\u000a        determinism.\u000d\u000a      A policy oriented conception of the life course which highlights\u000d\u000a        opportunities for interventions to\u000d\u000a        prevent the assumed `normal' course of ageing, for example with regard\u000d\u000a        to health and well-being\u000d\u000a        and skill retention.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Two contributions are especially worthy of note. Firstly, EU and UK\u000d\u000a      Government responses to\u000d\u000a      population ageing are dominated by what can best be described as a\u000d\u000a      `deficit' model of ageing\u000d\u000a      which portrays it as a problem, a fiscal burden and a drag on economic\u000d\u000a      performance. For example,\u000d\u000a      the EU's approach to active ageing, as expressed in the Lisbon targets, is\u000d\u000a      a matter of just working\u000d\u000a      longer. The new conceptualisation of active ageing takes a much more\u000d\u000a      positive approach in which\u000d\u000a      ageing is life long and, therefore offers multiple possibilities for\u000d\u000a      individual development with very\u000d\u000a      different societal implications. NGOs representing older people have found\u000d\u000a      this new concept of\u000d\u000a      active ageing particularly helpful in creating counter arguments to the\u000d\u000a      prevailing policy orientation.\u000d\u000a      Second, although the WHO framework was a significant step, conceptually\u000d\u000a      and practically, it was\u000d\u000a      biased towards health and not located within a broader approach to, and\u000d\u000a      theory of, ageing. In\u000d\u000a      contrast Walker's concept of active ageing, as well as taking a life\u000d\u000a      course approach, reflects an\u000d\u000a      innovative multi-disciplinary science of ageing (based in the NDA\u000d\u000a      Programme and combining both\u000d\u000a      biological and sociological insights); a comprehensive policy model which\u000d\u000a      connects all of the\u000d\u000a      relevant domains concerned with ageing; a preventative principle; an\u000d\u000a      empowerment orientation;\u000d\u000a      and is rooted in research among older people (under both GO and NDA\u000d\u000a      Programmes) into what\u000d\u000a      drives later life quality [R4, R5, R6]. The cumulative effect of this\u000d\u000a      research has been to influence\u000d\u000a      policy and practice internationally, nationally and locally.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3357","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research has been to inform adult understandings of\u000d\u000a      the needs that children of different ages have in relation to social and\u000d\u000a      physical space whilst they are in hospital.

They were asked to assess the extent to which the building\u000d\u000a      would be able to meet the child-friendly criteria identified by the\u000d\u000a      research and write a report. An email from Laing states that the report `was\u000d\u000a        well received by the Trust in Newcastle who will consider the points you\u000d\u000a        raise when developing their plans for commissioning the hospital'\u000d\u000a      post-construction.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, James and Curtis were contacted by Balfour Beatty who had been\u000d\u000a      short-listed as contractors for building the new Alderhey children's\u000d\u000a      hospital in Liverpool, that had an estimated build cost of circa &#163;288m.\u000d\u000a      This time James and Curtis were asked to act as consultants to the bid\u000d\u000a      team, as the architectural plans were being developed and refined. This\u000d\u000a      included: running workshops for the bid team - artists and architects\u000d\u000a      through to structural engineers and accountants - about the concept of\u000d\u000a      child-friendliness; assessing the child-friendliness of their initial\u000d\u000a      architectural plans in relation to the placement of playrooms, parent\u000d\u000a      facilities and types of decor; and commenting on the draft bid narrative\u000d\u000a      to highlight its child-friendly focus. A senior manager for Balfour Beatty\u000d\u000a      writes:\u000d\u000a    \"The input we received from Dr Penny Curtis and Professor Allison\u000d\u000a        James was instrumental in helping our team to appreciate the\u000d\u000a        fundamentals of designing child focused spaces within a hospital\u000d\u000a        environment. The workshops and design reviews led by Penny and Allison\u000d\u000a        challenged our thinking in designing for children. They particularly\u000d\u000a        helped us with the design of spaces for families, the importance of\u000d\u000a        personalisation and the creation of spaces that can be used by a broad\u000d\u000a        range of children and young people\". [S2]\u000d\u000a    In 2013 James and Curtis were again approached by Balfour Beatty to\u000d\u000a      assist with their bid plans for the redesign of the Edinburgh Sick\u000d\u000a      Children hospital (estimated build cost &#163;150m) by: (1) outlining key\u000d\u000a      design principles for a child-centred hospital; (2) reviewing and\u000d\u000a      critiquing designs with respect to layout, way-finding and decor; and (3)\u000d\u000a      conducting simulation exercises to test designs from a child- and\u000d\u000a      family-user perspective.\u000d\u000a    The global reach of the original research is made clear in Johnathan\u000d\u000a      Wilson's feature article in the trade publication Hospital Build, 4.\u000d\u000a      Principal and healthcare leader for Anshen + Allen (architectural partners\u000d\u000a      in the global design group Stantec who are specialists in healthcare\u000d\u000a      architecture), Wilson endorses wholeheartedly the project's\u000d\u000a      recommendations `to improve and enhance the experience of being a child\u000d\u000a        in hospital, social relationships and getting around the hospital',\u000d\u000a      describing the findings in relation to hospital waiting areas and the need\u000d\u000a      for separate adolescent spaces as being particularly `compelling'\u000d\u000a      [S3].\u000d\u000a    Making existing hospital facilities more `child friendly'\u000d\u000a    In 2007 the evaluation toolkits and key design principles were put on the\u000d\u000a      Department of Health Knowledge and Information Portal website, thereby\u000d\u000a      making them available for use by health professionals and NHS estates.\u000d\u000a      Evidence of their adoption include their adaptation by the Royal\u000d\u000a      Hallamshire Hospital to create a `child-friendly audit system' to\u000d\u000a      inform the work of their Stereotactic Radiosurgery Department and make it\u000d\u000a      more child friendly [S4]. International impact followed this in 2010 when\u000d\u000a      James and Curtis were contacted by Queensland Children's Hospital who also\u000d\u000a      requested access to the project's materials and findings. Subsequently,\u000d\u000a      Curtis visited Australia in October 2011 to discuss these with senior\u000d\u000a      managers at Royal Brisbane Children's Hospital who implemented them by:\u000d\u000a      including distraction art in treatment spaces, making space for young\u000d\u000a      people to personalise their bedrooms and restricting \"babyish\" images to\u000d\u000a      babies wards [S5].\u000d\u000a    In 2011 James and Curtis were contacted by planners at the Leeds General\u000d\u000a      Infirmary for advice about the problems children and parents were\u000d\u000a      experiencing with way-finding. A KT project was developed in order to\u000d\u000a      identify the key problem areas and a set of recommendations for\u000d\u000a      improvement was made. These were taken forward by the Trust and included:\u000d\u000a      making signs consistent and easier to follow, using the more familiar term\u000d\u000a      \"children's\" rather than \"paediatrics\" on signs, installing interactive\u000d\u000a      way-finding kiosks, revising the maps available for families on the\u000d\u000a      Internet and putting up child friendly wall art on the corridors [S6].\u000d\u000a    Sheffield Children's Hospital (SCH) has also drawn extensively on the\u000d\u000a      project's findings and recommendations. According to a senior manager, the\u000d\u000a      hospital \"fundamentally reviewed [its] accommodation\", and no\u000d\u000a      longer sees it simply in relation \"to demand, capacity and the needs of\u000d\u000a        clinicians\". Instead, they now view it from the \"perspective of\u000d\u000a        [their] families\". According to him, the project's findings were \"central\u000d\u000a        to the principles in [the] design specification for the new Children's\u000d\u000a        Hospital Wing and also informed the design and specifications\u000d\u000a        for the teenage psychiatry wards at Becton, completed in 2011\" [S7].\u000d\u000a      Building on the research findings about young people's needs, this\u000d\u000a      facility now offers bedrooms that allow for personalisation and is\u000d\u000a      equipped with gyms, soft rooms, games areas and outdoor recreational games\u000d\u000a      areas. Other parts of the main hospital have also been changed in\u000d\u000a      line with the children's recommendations from the research: for example,\u000d\u000a      age appropriate art has been installed, way-finding has been simplified,\u000d\u000a      with plain English and icons now being used on signs. Designated\u000d\u000a      adolescent areas are now provided in the Outpatient, Day Care and In\u000d\u000a      Patient areas. These are off limits to young children, reflecting\u000d\u000a      children's views about the need for age appropriate space. The Ryegate\u000d\u000a      therapy and hydrotherapy pool have been rebuilt to provide a less\u000d\u000a      cluttered and brighter kind of space. This was also identified by the\u000d\u000a      research as a major concern for children and young people.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the hospital's change in approach was further\u000d\u000a      demonstrated in 2013 by their decision to fund a new piece of research by\u000d\u000a      James and Curtis. The findings from this will inform the design of a\u000d\u000a      contract for the delivery of family centred care in the new single\u000d\u000a      occupancy cubicle facility currently being built and due to be completed\u000d\u000a      in 2015. As a senior manager writes: \"The Space to Care project has\u000d\u000a        fundamentally changed the priorities of the hospital and trust\"\u000d\u000a      [S7].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In response to a new NHS policy initiative to create child-friendly\u000d\u000a      hospitals, an ESRC funded research project (Space to Care, 2004-7)\u000d\u000a      explored children's own perceptions and experiences of hospital space by\u000d\u000a      seeking out the views of children aged 4-16 who were hospital patients.\u000d\u000a      Through revealing the importance of age as a key differentiating factor in\u000d\u000a      children and young people's views about hospital space, the result of\u000d\u000a      adopting this child-centred approach was to demonstrate that the\u000d\u000a      government's concept of a `child-friendly hospital' was failing to address\u000d\u000a      the different needs of all children up to the age of 16.

The ESRC funded Space to Care\u000d\u000a      study (2004-7) explored the implications of this for children's hospitals\u000d\u000a      where the stated aim is to provide child-friendly hospitals that meet the\u000d\u000a      differing needs of children of all ages. [see (2004) Health Building\u000d\u000a        Note 23. Hospital accommodation for children and young people;\u000d\u000a      (2003) Improving the patient experience &#8212; Friendly healthcare\u000d\u000a        environments for children and young people]. However, in these\u000d\u000a      policy documents there was little evidence to substantiate what the\u000d\u000a      concept of `child- friendly' means in the hospital context and no focused\u000d\u000a      consultations had been carried out, by policymakers, to ascertain\u000d\u000a      children's and young people's own understandings or experiences of\u000d\u000a      hospital space. Adult preferences about hospital space had been\u000d\u000a      transplanted uncritically into the policy documents shaping hospital\u000d\u000a      environments for children. This study of children's perceptions of\u000d\u000a      hospital space was therefore the first of its kind.\u000d\u000a    Based at Sheffield University, the research team comprised Professor\u000d\u000a      Allison James from Sociological Studies and other colleagues &#8212; Professor\u000d\u000a      Penny Curtis and Dr Jo Birch - from the Centre for the Study of Childhood\u000d\u000a      and Youth, Sheffield University. Together they brought the theoretical and\u000d\u000a      methodological insights of childhood studies to address this substantive\u000d\u000a      policy issue.\u000d\u000a    The study\u000d\u000a    The original research explored children's perceptions and experiences of\u000d\u000a      both inpatient and outpatient hospital facilities within three different\u000d\u000a      types of hospital: an established children's hospital, a newly built\u000d\u000a      specialist facility and a children's ward in a general hospital. Fieldwork\u000d\u000a      and interviews with 255 children aged between 4 and 16 were conducted\u000d\u000a      using a range of child-centred methods, including a specially developed\u000d\u000a      photo-elicitation and spatial mapping tool. Children of different ages\u000d\u000a      were asked to comment on the physical and social characteristics of the\u000d\u000a      spaces provided for them in hospital: the space around their beds,\u000d\u000a      treatment rooms, corridors, canteens, bathrooms and play rooms. These\u000d\u000a      research methods enabled children to voice their own views and\u000d\u000a      understandings of different hospital spaces and also revealed what it\u000d\u000a      feels like to be a child or young person within such an institutionalised\u000d\u000a      setting (R2, R3).\u000d\u000a    Across all the different settings, both children and young people said\u000d\u000a      that hospital environments seemed to be designed with only babies and\u000d\u000a      infants in mind. Even children as young as 7 experienced hospital spaces,\u000d\u000a      such as play rooms, as rather babyish in terms of their d&#233;cor and\u000d\u000a      recreational facilities (R1). Age was shown therefore to be a key,\u000d\u000a      differentiating factor for children and young people, especially in\u000d\u000a      relation to social and quiet spaces, recreational facilities, the\u000d\u000a      personalisation of bed spaces and the need for privacy (R4). Children and\u000d\u000a      young people also commented on the quality and sense of hospital space:\u000d\u000a      they disliked places that appeared dull, dirty or messy, preferring\u000d\u000a      instead those which looked colourful, bright, clean, tidy and comfortable,\u000d\u000a      with age appropriate art on the walls (R1). Treatment areas were\u000d\u000a      appreciated where the clinical aspects were disguised. These consultations\u000d\u000a      with children and young people revealed, therefore, that the hospital\u000d\u000a      environment is important to them in ways that are not currently being\u000d\u000a      addressed in adult assumptions about what constitutes a child-friendly\u000d\u000a      environment.\u000d\u000a    The project's findings were reported in the ESRC end of the award report\u000d\u000a      and academic publications. They were also used to develop a series of\u000d\u000a      toolkits for architects, health-care planners and professionals to\u000d\u000a      evaluate the `child-friendliness' of existing hospital environments. A\u000d\u000a      dissemination conference was also held, in 2007, which was attended by 50+\u000d\u000a      healthcare architects, health-care professionals and policy makers.\u000d\u000a    The original research led directly to a knowledge transfer project,\u000d\u000a      carried out at the request of Leeds General Infirmary in 2011, which\u000d\u000a      explored the problems experienced by parents and children in negotiating\u000d\u000a      their way around the hospital and also underpins a new project currently\u000d\u000a      being undertaken on behalf of Sheffield Children's Hospital (2013-4) to\u000d\u000a      examine how design and spatial issues might influence children's, parents'\u000d\u000a      and nurses' views of family-centred care.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3358","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact on identifying and supporting improvements in collaborative\u000d\u000a          partnership working.\u000d\u000a    The Welsh Assembly Joint Inspectorate, having commissioned the\u000d\u000a      development of the framework into SAIT, formally launched it in May 2009\u000d\u000a      and since then all Welsh LSCBs have been expected to complete an annual\u000d\u000a      evaluation using SAIT.

They drew on the conceptual framework to inform the\u000d\u000a      development of statutory multidisciplinary strategic partnerships to\u000d\u000a      safeguard children. For example, in 2012 the Northern Ireland Safeguarding\u000d\u000a      Children Board commissioned Horwath, who, using SAIT, assisted them in\u000d\u000a      developing their strategic vision and governance arrangements. This, in\u000d\u000a      turn, informed ways in which the members of the board collaborate with\u000d\u000a      other partnerships ensuring duplication is avoided.\u000d\u000a    The Framework has been particularly beneficial to policymakers and senior\u000d\u000a      managers in Cape Province, South Africa and New South Wales, Australia as\u000d\u000a      it has provided them with the scaffolding to build effective structures\u000d\u000a      and systems to promote inter-agency practice. A Chief Executive Officer of\u000d\u000a      state services in New South Wales described how SAIT informed the major\u000d\u000a      programme of reform to the state's child protection system:\u000d\u000a    \"assisting with the practicalities of translating the strategic vision\u000d\u000a        for shared responsibility for child wellbeing into shared goals.... as\u000d\u000a        well as promoting dialogue about challenges and strategies that would\u000d\u000a        assist senior managers and the executive to implement cultural change\u000d\u000a        across the child protection sector\". (S5)\u000d\u000a    SAIT has also been used with members of the equivalent of local LSCBs in\u000d\u000a      Portugal as well as policymakers sitting on a national LSCB to identify\u000d\u000a      ways in which they can use the framework to improve their\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinary arrangements (S6).\u000d\u000a    Impact on the development of government guidance\u000d\u000a    The Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors\u000d\u000a      of Social Services, with support from the Welsh Assembly, have\u000d\u000a      commissioned Horwath to work with existing members of LSCBs, using the\u000d\u000a      conceptual framework and SAIT, to identify the regulations and guidance\u000d\u000a      required from Government for new, regional safeguarding children boards\u000d\u000a      (S7).\u000d\u000a    SAIT informed the content of the chapter on multidisciplinary training\u000d\u000a      and development in the English Working Together to Safeguard Children:\u000d\u000a        A guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of\u000d\u000a        children (HM Government 2006, 2010) (S8). For example, members of\u000d\u000a      LSCBs who used SAIT indicated that the collective multidisciplinary\u000d\u000a      analysis of issues is more likely to lead to both a shared understanding\u000d\u000a      and group ownership of the solution. This can be achieved through an\u000d\u000a      annual LSCB development day, which was specified in the guidance and is\u000d\u000a      now routinised practice in most boards.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Senior managers in agencies in contact with children are frequently\u000d\u000a      criticised, particularly in reports following child deaths, for failing to\u000d\u000a      facilitate collaborative working to safeguard children.

For example, with regard\u000d\u000a      to component 1 the first standard is:\u000d\u000a    The Board has a clear and shared understanding about which elements of\u000d\u000a        safeguarding it is accountable for and for which it is holding others to\u000d\u000a        account.\u000d\u000a    An indicator enabling the Board to demonstrate that they are doing this\u000d\u000a      at an advanced level is:\u000d\u000a    The LSCB has an active plan about progressing safeguarding work with\u000d\u000a        different populations of children\/young people\u000d\u000a    The framework, standards and indicators are known as SAIT\u000d\u000a      (Self-Assessment and Improvement Tool).\u000d\u000a    The researchers\u000d\u000a    Professor Jan Horwath and the late Dr Tony Morrison (an independent\u000d\u000a      consultant and visiting research fellow at the University of Huddersfield)\u000d\u000a      shared a long-standing interest in the management of child welfare\u000d\u000a      systems. Their partnership brought together theory, research and practice\u000d\u000a      experience drawing equally on Horwath's research and Morrison's\u000d\u000a      developmental work. The original research was completed between 2004-9.\u000d\u000a    Originality and distinctiveness\u000d\u000a    SAIT is unique as it draws on research and practice experience in both\u000d\u000a      child protection and partnership working to inform the development of\u000d\u000a      safe, multidisciplinary, child protection systems. This combination\u000d\u000a      enables members of boards to take account of both the national context in\u000d\u000a      which partnerships operate and the powerful influences of organisational\u000d\u000a      regulation and risk management on partnership direction. SAIT is\u000d\u000a      distinctive in as much as it has been tested for relevance by both\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and senior managers. Moreover, it is useful irrespective of\u000d\u000a      nation state, demonstrated by Horwath's work in New South Wales, Portugal\u000d\u000a      and Cape Province South Africa, and Morrison's in Canada, New Zealand and\u000d\u000a      Western Australia.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3697","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The phenomenon of children living in AIDS-affected families in\u000d\u000a      sub-Saharan Africa was first\u000d\u000a      identified in the mid-1990s, and has risen to massive proportions, with an\u000d\u000a      estimated 3-4 million\u000d\u000a      AIDS-affected children in South Africa alone. This programme of research\u000d\u000a      has been explicitly\u000d\u000a      designed to maximise impact on three key sets of stakeholders responsible\u000d\u000a      for policymaking for\u000d\u000a      AIDS-affected children: 1) the South African government; 2) NGOs (UNICEF,\u000d\u000a      Save the Children\u000d\u000a      and local NGOs providing care to AIDS-affected children); and 3) the US\u000d\u000a      President's Emergency\u000d\u000a      Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR-USAID). The direct utilisation of these\u000d\u000a      studies by policymakers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa has contributed to the mitigation of\u000d\u000a      the effects of AIDS on some\u000d\u000a      of the world's most vulnerable children.\u000d\u000a    Impact 1 - South African government policy and planning\u000d\u000a      In South Africa, three government departments have joint responsibility\u000d\u000a      for AIDS-affected children:\u000d\u000a      the Department of Social Development (lead), the Department of Health, and\u000d\u000a      the Department of\u000d\u000a      Basic Education. The research team has worked closely with all three\u000d\u000a      departments at national\u000d\u000a      level, and all were partners in the research design and implementation,\u000d\u000a      including the former\u000d\u000a      Minister of Social Development, Dr Zola Skweyiya. As a result, the South\u000d\u000a      African government has\u000d\u000a      extensively used and cited the research findings [Section 5: C1].\u000d\u000a      For example, at the South\u000d\u000a      African National Orphans and Vulnerable Children conference (Durban 2013),\u000d\u000a      the Minister of\u000d\u000a      Health, Dr Aaron Motsoeledi, quoted the research in his plenary\u000d\u000a      presentation (Cluver et al, 2013 on\u000d\u000a      tuberculosis risks for child carers). The team's papers have been cited in\u000d\u000a      a number of major policy\u000d\u000a      documents that are used to determine the provision of services for\u000d\u000a      AIDS-affected children. These\u000d\u000a      include the SA National Action Plan for children affected by HIV\/AIDS\u000d\u000a      [C2] (5 citations), which\u000d\u000a      provides a five-year national framework for all government agencies and\u000d\u000a      NGOs working with these\u000d\u000a      groups, and based on the findings now includes a requirement for\u000d\u000a      programmes to support young\u000d\u000a      carers, youth-headed households and psychosocial support. The research was\u000d\u000a      also used in the\u000d\u000a      development of the government's National AIDS Council's National\u000d\u000a        Strategic Plan for HIV\/AIDS\u000d\u000a        Information Resource (7 citations), which provides a broader\u000d\u000a      national framework for HIV\/AIDS\u000d\u000a      programming. Findings have been directly used in training manuals for\u000d\u000a      government health and\u000d\u000a      community workers, for example the Department of Social Development's `Training\u000d\u000a        in psychosocial\u000d\u000a        support for orphans and other children made vulnerable by HIV\/AIDS'\u000d\u000a      [C3] (7 citations). In\u000d\u000a      addition, the research has led to Dr Cluver being appointed, as one of\u000d\u000a      only two researchers, onto\u000d\u000a      the influential policymaking body the South African National Action\u000d\u000a      Committee for Children\u000d\u000a      Affected by AIDS (NACCA), as an advisor to the National Department of\u000d\u000a      Basic Education, and the\u000d\u000a      National HIV+ Paediatric and Adolescent Technical Working Group in the\u000d\u000a      National Department of\u000d\u000a      Health.\u000d\u000a    Impact 2 - International NGO policy and programming\u000d\u000a      Five key international NGOs and supra-national bodies are stakeholders in\u000d\u000a      the provision of policy\u000d\u000a      and interventions for AIDS-affected children in sub-Saharan Africa. The\u000d\u000a      research team has worked\u000d\u000a      closely with UNICEF, Save the Children, the Regional Interagency Task Team\u000d\u000a      for Children\u000d\u000a      Affected by AIDS and the Regional Psychosocial Support Initiative, and has\u000d\u000a      engaged with World\u000d\u000a      Vision, which works closely with PEPFAR-USAID (see below). The team's\u000d\u000a      findings on child\u000d\u000a      physical, sexual and emotional abuse and mental health influenced the\u000d\u000a      development of Save the\u000d\u000a      Children's programming for abuse prevention for AIDS-affected children, as\u000d\u000a      set out in their 2012\u000d\u000a      policy document Child Protection in the Context of HIV and AIDS [C4]\u000d\u000a      (5 citations). These findings\u000d\u000a      were also instrumental in the child protection policy developed by UNICEF\u000d\u000a      in 2013 Building\u000d\u000a        protection and resilience: synergies for child protection systems and\u000d\u000a        children affected by HIV and\u000d\u000a        AIDS (15 citations). Both of these documents set out the\u000d\u000a      intervention approaches that will be\u000d\u000a      undertaken by Save the Children and UNICEF's direct programmes and\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries, between\u000d\u000a      them reaching millions of children in the region. By demonstrating the\u000d\u000a      negative impacts of AIDS-related\u000d\u000a      poverty on children, this research also contributed to UNICEF's 2012\u000d\u000a        report on HIV-sensitive\u000d\u000a        social protection [C5] (8 citations) and was instrumental in\u000d\u000a      their policy decision that AIDS-affected\u000d\u000a      children required targeted social provision. In a further contribution to\u000d\u000a      this debate, UNAIDS\u000d\u000a      has invited Cluver to speak on a panel on HIV-sensitive social protection\u000d\u000a      at the 2014 International\u000d\u000a      AIDS Conference, alongside President Banda of Malawi and the Special\u000d\u000a      Advisor to the UN\u000d\u000a      Secretary General [R6]. In an example of direct influence on\u000d\u000a      programming, the Regional\u000d\u000a        Psychosocial Support Initiative, an African NGO reaching over a\u000d\u000a      million children, used the findings\u000d\u000a      of the Young Carers study to directly inform their 2011 training manual\u000d\u000a      for community workers:\u000d\u000a      Programme guidelines for households in which young people are caring\u000d\u000a        for other household\u000d\u000a        members [C6] (2 citations).\u000d\u000a    Impact 3 - US government foreign aid policy and programming\u000d\u000a      The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR-USAID) is the\u000d\u000a      largest single funder of\u000d\u000a      programming for AIDS-affected children globally, with a\u000d\u000a      congressionally-mandated budgetary\u000d\u000a      requirement of 10% of the US HIV\/AIDS budget, comprising around $4.6\u000d\u000a      billion annually. PEPFAR-USAID\u000d\u000a      funds national government programmes as well as a large network of NGOs\u000d\u000a      primarily\u000d\u000a      within sub-Saharan Africa, all of which are required to follow their\u000d\u000a      seven-yearly programming\u000d\u000a      guidance. The research team were extensively consulted in the development\u000d\u000a      of the PEPFAR-USAID\u000d\u000a        Guidance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming (2012) [C7]\u000d\u000a      (7 citations,\u000d\u000a      (more than any other research group), with six recommended in the\u000d\u000a      `Evidence Matrix'). The team's\u000d\u000a      research was used to strengthen the evidence-base for the development of\u000d\u000a      programming in\u000d\u000a      psychosocial support, economic strengthening and child abuse prevention\u000d\u000a      within PEPFAR-funded\u000d\u000a      programmes reaching an estimated 4.5 million children per year.

This was the world's first longitudinal study of AIDS-orphaned\u000d\u000a      children, following 1025\u000d\u000a      children over four years in high-deprivation urban South Africa, and with\u000d\u000a      linked qualitative studies.\u000d\u000a      Findings showed major and long-term impacts on child development,\u000d\u000a      educational, psychological\u000d\u000a      and sexual health (Cluver et al. 2012; Orkin et al. 2013). In 2005-6,\u000d\u000a      AIDS-orphaned children had\u000d\u000a      higher levels of psychological disorder than non-orphans and also than\u000d\u000a      those orphaned by\u000d\u000a      homicide, suicide or cancer (Cluver et al. 2007). Negative effects of\u000d\u000a      AIDS-orphanhood worsened\u000d\u000a      over a four-year period [Section 3: R1]. Findings showed causal\u000d\u000a      factors directly related to the\u000d\u000a      social sequelae of AIDS, including stigma, extreme poverty and bullying [R3;\u000d\u000a      Cluver et al. 2008,\u000d\u000a      2009 a; 2009b; 2009c; 2010; Boyes et al. 2013]. The study also\u000d\u000a      found threefold risk of child abuse\u000d\u000a      in AIDS-affected families, and threefold levels of transactional sex, a\u000d\u000a      major vector of HIV-infection\u000d\u000a      for young African girls. The combination of parental AIDS, poverty and\u000d\u000a      abuse raised the risk of\u000d\u000a      transactional sex from 1% to 57% [R2].\u000d\u000a    The Young Carers Study: 2009-2013 (Section 3 references 4-6).\u000d\u000a      (www.youngcarers.org.za) PI:\u000d\u000a      Oxford University: Dr L.

This\u000d\u000a      study is, thus far, the world's largest study of AIDS-affected children,\u000d\u000a      and uses rigorous longitudinal\u000d\u000a      sampling to identify impacts of parental AIDS-illness and orphanhood. It\u000d\u000a      has followed 6004 children\u000d\u000a      between 2009-2012, using stratified random sampling in six urban and rural\u000d\u000a      sites within three\u000d\u000a      South African provinces. In addition, the study has interviewed 2500\u000d\u000a      primary caregivers (matched\u000d\u000a      with children), and includes linked qualitative studies. Findings show\u000d\u000a      that parental AIDS-illness\u000d\u000a      leads to severe negative educational, sexual and psychological effects [R4;\u000d\u000a      Lachman et al 2013].\u000d\u000a      For example, children's risk of contracting tuberculosis rises from 2% to\u000d\u000a      18% by providing medical\u000d\u000a      care to sick adults (Cluver et al, 2013). Models show important\u000d\u000a      interactive `risk pathways' from\u000d\u000a      familial AIDS to child vulnerabilities, via factors including abuse,\u000d\u000a      parental disability, stigma and\u000d\u000a      poverty [R5]. Recent longitudinal findings identify important\u000d\u000a      HIV-prevention impacts of social\u000d\u000a      welfare grants, with 50-65% reductions in incidence of HIV-risk behaviours\u000d\u000a      amongst girls [R6].\u000d\u000a    Building on the impact of the work described above, further engaged\u000d\u000a      research continues to\u000d\u000a      develop. For example, findings showing increased child abuse in\u000d\u000a      AIDS-affected families have led\u000d\u000a      to a set of randomised controlled trials of child abuse prevention\u000d\u000a      programmes starting in 2013, in\u000d\u000a      partnership with the WHO, UNICEF, the South African government and the\u000d\u000a      University of Cape\u000d\u000a      Town. These were pump-primed by an internal University Research Fund\u000d\u000a      (2011-13) and have\u000d\u000a      subsequently been awarded &#8364;1.46 million by the European Research Council\u000d\u000a      (2013-18); 2.9\u000d\u000a      million South African rand from Ilifa Labantwana (2012-14) and 800,000 SA\u000d\u000a      rand from the WHO\u000d\u000a      and SA National Lottery (2012-14).\u000d\u000a    This research also highlighted the unmet needs of HIV-positive\u000d\u000a      adolescents, and has led to a new,\u000d\u000a      mixed-methods research study to identify risk and protective factors for\u000d\u000a      their adherence to\u000d\u000a      antiretroviral medication and access to sexual and reproductive health\u000d\u000a      services.

The impact\u000d\u000a      in this case study is underpinned by the following research:\u000d\u000a    Context: Mobile groups and individuals are often very difficult to\u000d\u000a      reach for the purposes of\u000d\u000a      data gathering or consultation and often confront barriers to social\u000d\u000a      inclusion, compounding\u000d\u000a      their inaccessibility for researchers and policymakers. Planning and\u000d\u000a      policy decisions are\u000d\u000a      critically affected by the absence of robust data and the absence of a\u000d\u000a      `voice' for these groups,\u000d\u000a      as highlighted in the following recent developments:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Between 2004 and 2006 new legislation in the UK directed local\u000d\u000a        authorities to assess the\u000d\u000a        accommodation needs of Gypsy and Traveller communities. The legislation\u000d\u000a        also brought\u000d\u000a        a statutory duty to provide sites and pitches for Gypsies and\u000d\u000a        Travellers.\u000d\u000a      The opening up of the European Community to the new Accession (A8 and\u000d\u000a        A2) countries\u000d\u000a        resulted in possibly the largest migration of people within the\u000d\u000a        continent in recent years.\u000d\u000a      The adoption of a Points-Based System for immigration in 2008 and the\u000d\u000a        imposition of a\u000d\u000a        cap on migrants in 2011 were based on assumptions about the\u000d\u000a        characteristics of\u000d\u000a        migrants to the UK, their typical modes of intersection with the labour\u000d\u000a        market and the\u000d\u000a        national benefits system, yet not much was known about their\u000d\u000a        experiences, aspirations\u000d\u000a        and needs.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Method: Standard models for data collection do not work well with\u000d\u000a      these groups. For\u000d\u000a      example, there is usually no sampling frame; there may be linguistic\u000d\u000a      barriers to\u000d\u000a      communication; and often much suspicion or misunderstanding among Gypsy\u000d\u000a      and Traveller\u000d\u000a      communities regarding the nature of the exercise:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Scullion et al. developed a community-based research model for data\u000d\u000a        collection which\u000d\u000a        was first used in work for local authorities to assess the housing needs\u000d\u000a        of Black and\u000d\u000a        minority ethnic (BME) communities and then of Gypsy and Traveller\u000d\u000a        communities.\u000d\u000a        Through this model, community members were involved in the data\u000d\u000a        collection process,\u000d\u000a        helping to ensure that the questions asked were appropriate and that the\u000d\u000a        methods of\u000d\u000a        consultation were as unobtrusive as possible. These members were trained\u000d\u000a        as\u000d\u000a        community interviewers and held primary responsibility for data\u000d\u000a        collection at each site.\u000d\u000a        Often, they were able to make use of informal networks to contact\u000d\u000a        community members\u000d\u000a        and seek relevant information from them. In particular, they were very\u000d\u000a        alert to intra-group\u000d\u000a        differences that might have been invisible to the professional\u000d\u000a        researcher but which could\u000d\u000a        impact negatively on the data collection process. [1,2]\u000a\u000d\u000a      Employing a conceptual model of agency and structure, Scullion and\u000d\u000a        colleagues have\u000d\u000a        made some significant contributions to the scholarship on mobile and\u000d\u000a        migrant groups,\u000d\u000a        identifiying structural barriers to integration arising from dispersal\u000d\u000a        and loss of status\u000d\u000a        among women asylum seekers and refugees, and their exercise of agency in\u000d\u000a        the spheres\u000d\u000a        of consumption, education, employment and sociality. [3]\u000a\u000d\u000a      A study of Travelling Showpeople explores how this distinction has\u000d\u000a        been influenced by,\u000d\u000a        and has influenced, policy developments relating to accommodation. It\u000d\u000a        focuses on how\u000d\u000a        this distinction has created a degree of exclusion in terms of\u000d\u000a        accommodation needs, and\u000d\u000a        the impact on the position of contemporary Travelling Showpeople.

The work was commissioned by the\u000d      Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions for the purpose\u000d      of distributing regeneration funds. The new conceptual model of multiple\u000d      deprivation developed by SDRC is based on the idea of distinct\u000d      uni-dimensional domains of deprivation (e.g. income, employment, health,\u000d      education, housing and crime) that are recognised and measured separately.\u000d      The domains are combined, with appropriate weighting, into a single\u000d      measure of multiple deprivation: a weighted area level aggregation [Section\u000a        3: R1, R2]. The index differed markedly from previous measures that\u000d      had been in existence since 1981 not only because of the methodological\u000d      innovations but also because of the use of administrative data rather than\u000d      Census data, including a ground-breaking administrative resource of\u000d      recorded crime data from all police forces in the country (data that no\u000d      other researcher has been granted access to before or since) [R1, R2].\u000d      SDRC was also commissioned to produce the first indices of deprivation in\u000d      each other country in the UK (2000-2003). These were updated on several\u000d      occasions and SDRC was either commissioned to do the work or acted in an\u000d      advisory capacity (2003-2011). SDRC (with the University of York) also\u000d      produced a child well-being index for England (2008), describing patterns\u000d      of child well-being across England [R3]. In each of these cases,\u000d      the datasets providing a ranking of small areas on the separate domains\u000d      and overall indices are the main tools utilised by users of the research\u000d      for targeting resources and interventions, as detailed in the next\u000d      section.\u000d    The methodology and outputs of the programme of research have been\u000d      subjected to intense scrutiny. The English Indices of Deprivation 2004 and\u000d      2007 were peer-reviewed by Professor Bradshaw (University of York) and\u000d      Professor Alcock (University of Birmingham) respectively, while\u000d      independent analysis relating to particular elements of the methodology\u000d      (e.g. the weightings) has been undertaken and has broadly confirmed the\u000d      methodology. The most recent versions of the UK indices have been\u000d      designated as either official or national statistics. This involves a\u000d      rigorous quality assurance process (see http:\/\/www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk\/national-statistician\/types-of-official-statistics).\u000d    This methodology was subsequently used internationally by CASASP. The\u000d      first indices of deprivation for South Africa were developed in\u000d      collaboration with Statistics South Africa and the Human Sciences Research\u000d      Council (HSRC) (2006) [R4]. An index of multiple deprivation for\u000d      children was also undertaken with HSRC (2007) [R5]. Updates of the\u000d      South African indices were commissioned by the South African Department of\u000d      Social Development. CASASP developed a new small area statistical\u000d      geography for South Africa, similar to the geographical units used\u000d      latterly in the UK index work. Both total population and child indices\u000d      were produced at this spatial scale (2009), allowing for a more\u000d      fine-grained analysis of deprivation, exposing high levels of deprivation\u000d      in the former homelands [R6].\u000d    In addition to the above indices, CASASP has recently been commissioned\u000d      to produce indices of deprivation for Oman and Namibia. Other Southern\u000d      African countries - Zambia and Mozambique - have also expressed an\u000d      interest. This research is still quite recent and has not yet had a chance\u000d      to have impact, however both CASASP and SDRC take a partnership approach\u000d      to their research and regularly work with external policymaking bodies,\u000d      providing an opportunity for co-designed and produced research.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4607","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research into elite philanthropy and `million pound donors' has\u000d\u000a      benefited policy makers and practitioners by providing unique empirical\u000d\u000a      data and understanding of `top end' of charitable giving.

The GGP directly cites research by Breeze.\u000d\u000a      Significantly, civil servants in the Office for Civil Society within the\u000d\u000a      Cabinet Office charged with drafting the GWP were instructed by the Senior\u000d\u000a      Policy Advisor (Cabinet Office) to read the report How Donors Choose\u000d\u000a        Charities [ref 3.7], which documents the barriers facing\u000d\u000a      donors. The research findings contained in the report were mirrored in the\u000d\u000a      final GWP which noted `the evidence both from research studies and our own\u000d\u000a      consultation shows that many people and organisations ...want to give\u000d\u000a      more. They are put off doing so because too often giving is unnecessarily\u000d\u000a      difficult or complicated, and is not as rewarding as it could or should\u000d\u000a      be' (GWP, 2011, p.9) [corrob 5.4].\u000d\u000a    Impact on legislation:\u000d\u000a    The research has also influenced government policy decisions, notably the\u000d\u000a      decision to abandon the proposed cap on charity tax reliefs announced in\u000d\u000a      the 2012 Budget. As the only source of data on the biggest donations, the\u000d\u000a      research made it possible to identify a number of potential problems with\u000d\u000a      the proposal, meaning it was regularly cited by journalists from both\u000d\u000a      mainstream and sector media. The `Give it back George' campaign,\u000d\u000a      which was launched to fight the proposal, cited the research data on its\u000d\u000a      `key stats' page [corrob 5.5] and mainstream media citations of the\u000d\u000a      research (including headline news in the third sector supplements) during\u000d\u000a      the campaign included: The Economist, Financial Times and\u000d\u000a      The Guardian [corrob 5.6]. The research was described as\u000d\u000a      `invaluable' by the FT's charity correspondent, who attests, `the Million\u000d\u000a      Pound Donor report has proven a vital tool in my reporting' [corrob 5.7].\u000a      After 10 weeks of intensive campaigning, during which the data was\u000d\u000a      repeatedly cited and Breeze quoted, the proposal was withdrawn. The\u000d\u000a      campaign was named as `Voluntary sector campaign of the year' and the\u000d\u000a      contribution of the research described as `immensely useful' to\u000d\u000a      the campaign's success by the Charities Aid Foundation [corrob 5.8].\u000d\u000a    Use of research findings by charities and lobby groups:\u000a The\u000d\u000a      research has helped charity sector bodies to improve professional practice\u000d\u000a      and standards in fundraising as they seek to attract more major donations.\u000d\u000a      The research was presented to the UK's biggest fundraising charities (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Cancer Research UK, NSPCC, RNLI, Marie Curie, MacMillan, ActionAid), as\u000d\u000a      well as at major sector and training events (e.g. Institute of Fundraising\u000d\u000a      national, regional and major donor conferences, European Association of\u000d\u000a      Planned Giving, Philanthropy Impact, and Raising Funds from the Rich which\u000d\u000a      draws 1,000+ audiences of fundraisers). Breeze has been consequently named\u000d\u000a      as one of the most 50 influential people in fundraising in 2013 on the\u000d\u000a      prestigious civilsociety.co.uk website, only one of two academics to be\u000d\u000a      listed [corrob 5.9]. Breeze also served as a member of the advisory\u000d\u000a      committee for an influential report funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates\u000d\u000a      Foundation Money for Good [corrob 5.10] and was a member of\u000d\u000a      the Working Party that helped write the Manifesto for Community\u000d\u000a        Philanthropists [corrob 5.11]. This has allowed the research\u000d\u000a      to inform the most influential non-governmental initiative during this REF\u000d\u000a      cycle, The Philanthropy Review (TPR), which involved leaders from\u000d\u000a      the business and charitable sectors seeking to catalyse a step change in\u000d\u000a      the giving of money in the UK [corrob 5.12]. The contribution of\u000d\u000a      the research to the work of TPR is confirmed by its Director, `in the\u000d\u000a      course of our work...we drew on a number of papers and articles authored\u000d\u000a      by Dr Beth Breeze' [corrob 5.13]. The Director of Professional\u000d\u000a      Development at the Institute of Fundraising also comments that `the\u000d\u000a      research ... has had a positive impact on our efforts to professionalise\u000d\u000a      fundraising' [corrob 5.14]. Finally, one of the government's\u000d\u000a      key strategic partners, supporting and informing their policy in this area\u000d\u000a      is Philanthropy Impact (previously Philanthropy UK). Breeze served on the\u000d\u000a      Philanthropy UK editorial board from 2008-2012 and its Director has\u000d\u000a      confirmed that the `research into understanding the motivations and\u000d\u000a      perceptions of donors informed many of the features and articles that we\u000d\u000a      produced for our donor readership and helped us in our communication with\u000d\u000a      donors, funders, fundraisers, charities and other media' [corrob 5.15].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This research into rich donors in the UK has impacted on the policies of\u000d\u000a      both governmental and non-governmental bodies.

For example, in Cumbria ASCOT has\u000d\u000a      been introduced with the aim of `supporting cultural change in focusing on\u000d\u000a      outcomes and person-centred care planning and review', generating data\u000d\u000a      that has supported their planning and management of services. Cumbria's\u000d\u000a      Head of Social Care attests that `ASCOT is proving an invaluable tool in\u000d\u000a      helping us move to more outcome focused practice' [corrob 5.4]. The\u000d\u000a      Senior Monitoring Officer, Quality Monitoring Team East Sussex County\u000d\u000a      Council states `ASCOT has transformed the way we audit care homes. In the\u000d\u000a      past it used to be a paper- based exercise, with very little focus on the\u000d\u000a      client. Now we spend much more time observing and we feel that the\u000d\u000a      evidence we use is much more robust' [corrob 5.5].\u000d\u000a    Influence on professional practice and standards:\u000d\u000a    Feedback from workshops and training has indicated that reporting\u000d\u000a      qualitative and quantitative information based on the ASCOT measure\u000d\u000a      changes the focus of care work, resulting in improved quality of care and\u000d\u000a      outcomes for residents. For example, Saga now conduct regular surveys of\u000d\u000a      their service users and are collecting ASCOT data both for the purpose of\u000d\u000a      demonstrating outcomes to commissioners and for monitoring and improving\u000d\u000a      practice. In this light, PSSRU are currently conducting a feasibility\u000d\u000a      study, funded through the NIHR School for Social Care Research, to examine\u000d\u000a      how feeding back scores derived through ASCOT results in improved quality\u000d\u000a      of care. In total there are 806 registered users (an increase of over 160%\u000d\u000a      between 2012 and 2013), including many users from local councils and\u000d\u000a      service providers. At least 25 organisations have used ASCOT. Training and\u000d\u000a      workshops have proved popular: between 2011 and 2013 training was provided\u000d\u000a      to over 160 people from 45 different organisations. In addition, 177\u000d\u000a      people have attended workshops about ongoing developments and use of\u000d\u000a      ASCOT.\u000d\u000a    Influence on planning and managing services:\u000d\u000a    ASCOT has provided a means for benchmarking cost effectiveness across the\u000d\u000a      social care sector, with the structure and basis of the measure\u000d\u000a      (for example, domains of quality of life used) having fed into quality\u000d\u000a      assurance procedures by both local authorities and independent providers\u000d\u000a      of services. For example, the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE)\u000d\u000a      use ASCOT as a basis for defining excellence in social care to support\u000d\u000a      improving practice, and recommends its use in evaluating the cost\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of social care interventions [corrob 5.6]. Hence,\u000d\u000a      while ASCOT is still relatively new in terms of developing an evidence\u000d\u000a      base, it is designed to be used in economic evaluation and thus to provide\u000d\u000a      evidence of cost-effectiveness of services. When used in the economic\u000d\u000a      evaluation of personal health and social care budgets ASCOT provides\u000d\u000a      evidence which supports better resource management resulting in improved\u000d\u000a      service delivery.\u000d\u000a    A network has been set up to facilitate international communication and\u000d\u000a      collaboration in the use of ASCOT. Given this, international interest has\u000d\u000a      been widespread with attendees at workshops from Israel and Japan, with\u000d\u000a      considerable interest from Scandinavia (there is a Finnish section on the\u000d\u000a      ASCOT website) and Europe. Similar policy and practice impacts to those in\u000d\u000a      England are therefore starting be felt internationally. A recent OECD\u000d\u000a      report [corrob 5.7] identified that `other OECD countries, such as\u000d\u000a      Denmark, Austria, Finland and the Netherlands, are starting to use ASCOT'.\u000d\u000a      For example, a Finnish evaluation of outcome measures reports ASCOT as\u000d\u000a      `exceptional as it can be used as a research tool and also as a practical\u000d\u000a      tool in improving service production and social care practices' [corrob\u000d\u000a        5.8]. In Denmark, two large scale ASCOT studies of home care and\u000d\u000a      care homes for older people have been conducted on behalf of the\u000d\u000a      government, with a leader of the principal NGO for older people calling\u000d\u000a      for the measure to be included in regular national surveys [corrob 5.9].\u000a      ASCOT has also been translated into Dutch and here and elsewhere proposals\u000d\u000a      are being developed to undertake preference studies to reflect national\u000d\u000a      preferences in scoring for different countries and cultures. A version has\u000d\u000a      also been developed for the Austrian Home Visits and Counselling Programme\u000d\u000a      [corrob. 5.10]. Individual providers are taking an active interest,\u000d\u000a      among them NGOs in Australia (Domiciliary Care Adelaide) and\u000d\u000a      Finland (Solutos Oy mental health and substance abuse service), while in\u000d\u000a      Israel ASCOT is `serving to better think through policy and program\u000d\u000a      objectives' [corrob 5.11]. These examples demonstrate the\u000d\u000a      wide international influence of ASCOT on the planning of social care.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This research improved policy-makers' and practitioners' understanding of\u000d\u000a      well-being among residents of social care facilities by identifying the\u000d\u000a      factors contributing to residents' quality of life.

The Government\u000d\u000abrought the main recommendations forward in its Care and Support Bill (expected to receive\u000d\u000aassent in 2014).\u000d\u000aInforming the policy debate on the reform of social care funding\u000d\u000aThe research has had impact through shaping the views of senior policy-makers as to the best\u000d\u000aoptions for social care funding reform. Forder sat on the Stakeholder Panel on Reform of the Care\u000d\u000aand Support System chaired by the Director General of Social Care and attended by the care services\u000d\u000aMinister (in 2009). Forder also gave a number of briefings to high-level decision-makers, including\u000d\u000ato the Chancellor of the Exchequer (following a personal invite, 25 February 2009). The\u000d\u000aParliamentary debate on social care, which shaped the developing legislation, made specific\u000d\u000areferences to PSSRU research, as recorded in Hansard [corrob 5.4]: Forder was accordingly called\u000d\u000aas a witness in front of the House of Lords Public Service and Demographic Change Committee,\u000d\u000a13 November 2012 [corrob 5.5].\u000d\u000aLord Lipsey, an active participant in these debates, stated of PSSRU research: `The work of the\u000d\u000aPersonal Social Service Research Unit has been invaluable to all those involved in policy-making\u000d\u000ain this field. Indeed, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that there would have been no informed\u000d\u000apublic debate on these crucial issues without the factual and analytical material in which it excels'\u000d\u000a[corrob 5.6].\u000d\u000aTransforming public understanding of the costs of social care\u000d\u000aThe research informed the wider public debate, being used by non-government stakeholder\u000d\u000aorganisations to raise the priority given to care funding, and to improve public understanding of this\u000d\u000aissue through a series of engagement exercises.\u000d\u000aA number of influential organisations, such as Age UK, the King's Fund and the Strategic Society\u000d\u000aCentre, have drawn on the research when making the case for reform [corrob 5.7].\u000d\u000aPublic understanding &#8212; particularly of the financial liability of individuals in paying for social care -\u000d\u000awas improved by the research as it was discussed in the media and at stakeholder events. For\u000d\u000aexample, BBC Radio 4 ran a month-long series of programmes on care, including an interview with\u000d\u000aForder [corrob 5.8]. A Guardian article highlighted the PSSRU research on the potentially\u000d\u000acatastrophic costs faced by some care users, a key argument for reform used by Dilnot [corrob\u000d\u000a5.9].\u000d\u000aForder was also invited to discuss the research at a number of seminars and debates with social\u000d\u000acare stakeholders, including the Voluntary Organisations Disability Group (VODG) (19 September\u000d\u000a2008), Age UK (One Voice) (7 April 2009), National Care Forum (11 May 2011) and a meeting of\u000d\u000aprivate health care investors (Investing in social care, 29 November 2011). Such activity has helped\u000d\u000ashape the public policy debate and raised the profile of social care, which in turn is likely to have\u000d\u000ahelped to (a) secure a programme of reform on social care funding by Government, and (b) protect\u000d\u000alevels of social care funding.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aResearch on the financing of adult social care in England resulted in the development of a full\u000d\u000asimulation model of the social care economy.

The research underpinning this case study was\u000d\u000aprincipally completed by Forder (who joined Kent as a Professor in 2007 and became Director of\u000d\u000aPSSRU in 2013) in a joint collaboration with Fern&#225;ndez (PSSRU, LSE). It commenced in April\u000d\u000a2008 following a commission from the Department of Health to provide analyses for its Green\u000d\u000aPaper on funding and thereafter for its White Paper. The research was subsequently incorporated\u000d\u000ainto the work of the NIHR Policy Research Unit on economic systems of social and health care\u000d\u000a(ESHCRU) in 2011, part of which funded work for the Dilnot Commission.\u000d\u000aPrevious studies (e.g. the Wanless Review [see reference 3.5]) investigated the public funding of\u000d\u000asocial care and presented various options, but research was needed about the costs and benefits\u000d\u000aof different funding systems as they impacted on individuals over time. This research identified\u000d\u000athat:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aUnderlying demand for care is set to rise significantly as a result of the ageing population\u000d\u000aand trends in chronic diseases.\u000d\u000aThe price per unit of care service is, and is likely to continue, to rise faster than the rate of\u000d\u000ainflation.\u000d\u000aSocial care funding is beset by problems, including under-consumption; under-insurance;\u000d\u000apoor incentives to save; and perceived inequity, particularly for low-to-middle income\u000d\u000agroups.\u000d\u000aA dynamic model is needed which can take basic information about the observed\u000d\u000apopulation of older people and their willingness to pay for social care, and apply the rules\u000d\u000aand features of the current social care and benefits system to determine what support\u000d\u000apeople in different circumstances require.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aAccordingly, the first component of the research was the development of a new dynamic, micro-\u000d\u000asimulation model (DMS). This involved analyses of the demand and supply of publicly- and\u000d\u000aprivately-funded social care using existing PSSRU datasets, and data from both the British\u000d\u000aHousehold Panel Survey (BHPS) and the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA). Statistical\u000d\u000amodels of the social care assessment and delivery systems were estimated and combined with\u000d\u000aanalysis of the organisation and funding of social care [ref 3.2] to develop the DMS [ref 3.4 and\u000d\u000a3.1].\u000d\u000aThe model uses a baseline sample of people aged 65 and over from the BHPS. These people are\u000d\u000aaged in the simulation with the model predicting their need for social care, their intensity of use, the\u000d\u000acosts of their care and financial liability, and a range of outcomes for people that stem from their\u000d\u000asocial care. The model calculates morbidity, mortality, and income and wealth flows for each\u000d\u000aindividual.\u000d\u000aThe primary objective of the DMS modelling was to evaluate potential changes in care funding\u000d\u000apolicy. The model provided quantitative estimates of the impact of alternative funding\u000d\u000aarrangements on resource use, cost and outcomes. As well as the overall impact, the model\u000d\u000asimulated the distributional impacts: i.e. who would gain and who would lose from any given reform\u000d\u000aproposal.\u000d\u000aThe second component of the research (which ran concurrently from 2008) was to identify and\u000d\u000areview social care funding systems that could potentially be used in England. The research\u000d\u000aassessed the long-term funding arrangements that are used in different countries. A set of criteria\u000d\u000awas developed to consider the efficiency, equity and sustainability of different systems [ref 3.3].\u000d\u000aThese criteria could be used to interpret the output from the DMS modelling of different funding\u000d\u000aoptions.\u000d\u000aThe research has accordingly made two key contributions to the understanding of paying for social\u000d\u000acare. Firstly, it has provided a tool (the DMS) to comprehensively assess the implications of\u000d\u000aalternative funding systems. Secondly, it has identified and evaluated the best options for social\u000d\u000acare in the English situation, showing that more expensive options can produce better outcomes\u000d\u000aoverall [ref 3.5].\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"4653","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Stevens' research has provided unique evidence concerning the effects of\u000d\u000a      `progressive decriminalisation'. The research has transformed policy and\u000d\u000a      public debates by challenging existing punitive models. Using Stevens'\u000d\u000a      work, politicians and campaigners in the UK, US and elsewhere have been\u000d\u000a      able to propose moves towards decriminalisation on the basis of rigorous\u000d\u000a      evidence. The main beneficiaries of Stevens' research are therefore\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and campaigners who debate the best means to reduce the\u000d\u000a      harms associated with the consumption of illicit drugs through criminal\u000d\u000a      sanctions or alternatives based on voluntary treatment and\u000d\u000a      decriminalisation.\u000d\u000a    Impact on policy debate:\u000d\u000a    The research on Portuguese drugs policy has shifted drugs policy debate\u000d\u000a      in the UK, US and elsewhere, in the direction of considering\u000d\u000a      decriminalisation as a feasible and potentially effective policy. This\u000d\u000a      impact has been made possible by widespread citations in the media, in\u000d\u000a      policy reports and in `grey' literature. For example, the research has\u000d\u000a      been featured in The Observer (5 September 2010), in Time\u000d\u000a      magazine (article by Maia Szalavitz, 23 November 2010), in the Wall\u000d\u000a        Street Journal (article by Gary Becker and Kevin Murphy, 13 January\u000d\u000a      2013) and in many other news articles. The research has been cited in\u000d\u000a      policy reports both by campaigning NGOs (e.g. in the reports A\u000d\u000a          Quiet Revolution by Release [2012] and The\u000a          Alternative World Drug Report [2012] by Count the Costs) and\u000d\u000a      other NGOs in this field (e.g. A\u000d\u000a          Fresh Approach to Drugs by the UK Drug Policy Commission\u000d\u000a      [2013] and Drugs\u000a          of Dependence by the British Medical Association [2013]). The\u000d\u000a      international impact of Stevens' research on Portugal is also evidenced by\u000d\u000a      citations in the US and Australia in media and policy reports. In addition\u000d\u000a      to the articles in Time and the Wall Street Journal\u000d\u000a      referenced above, this includes a report on Alternatives\u000a          to Prohibition by the think-tank Australia 21. Stevens\u000d\u000a      was interviewed on his research on Portuguese decriminalisation on Radio\u000d\u000a      4's Today programme on 10 December 2012. The media profile\u000d\u000a      achieved by this research [see corroboration 5.1] has led to it\u000d\u000a      also being used by politicians in policy debates. For example, at its 2011\u000d\u000a      annual conference, the Liberal Democrat Party passed a motion specifically\u000d\u000a      referring to the Portuguese example in its call to re-examine drug policy\u000d\u000a      [corrob 5.2].\u000d\u000a    Impact on government policy:\u000d\u000a    The UK government embarked on a major expansion of quasi-compulsory\u000d\u000a      treatment from 2001 (in the form of the drug treatment and testing order)\u000d\u000a      without evidence on its effects. In this period, the US has also expanded\u000d\u000a      QCT through the creation of drug courts. Stevens' work has provided data\u000d\u000a      that support the assertion that this type of quasi-coerced treatment of\u000d\u000a      drug users can be as effective as voluntary programmes. His research\u000d\u000a      outputs have provided politicians with an impartial evidence base from\u000d\u000a      which future policies are being driven, and have moved the debate to\u000d\u000a      consider issues of the ethical limits of QCT and the issue of penal\u000d\u000a      net-widening.\u000d\u000a    These impacts have been attested to by politicians from both Houses of\u000d\u000a      Parliament. The Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Drug Policy\u000d\u000a      Reform [corrob 5.3] has written, `Professor Stevens has been one of\u000d\u000a      the few reliable sources of research evidence for politicians and opinion\u000d\u000a      formers.

One of the MP\u000d\u000a      members of the Home Affairs Select Committee confirms this, writing that,\u000d\u000a      `The Committee leaned on aspects of your work in reaching our conclusions\u000d\u000a      and your research helped us to reach a cross-party consensus within our\u000d\u000a      Committee when assessing the Portuguese model' [corrob 5.4].\u000d\u000a      Stevens' research has been cited in reports from all these parliamentary\u000d\u000a      bodies [corrob 5.5], with specific reference to the Portuguese\u000d\u000a      decriminalisation research made in the Home Affairs Select Committee\u000d\u000a      report Drugs:\u000a          Breaking the Cycle. Stevens' research was also cited in the\u000d\u000a      2008 national drug strategy and in 2009 by the Sentencing Advisory Panel\u000d\u000a      in a consultation which led to the reduction of prison sentence length for\u000d\u000a      some drug offences, in line with the recommendations from Stevens'\u000d\u000a      research.\u000d\u000a    Internationally, this research has been cited by the Global Commission on\u000d\u000a      Drug Policy in its report War on Drugs (2011) [corrob 5.6].\u000d\u000a      This organisation is committed to developing an informed, science-based\u000d\u000a      discussion on effective ways to reduce the harm caused by drugs, and\u000d\u000a      includes among its commissioners a number of former presidents, prime\u000d\u000a      ministers and foreign secretaries from an international arena including\u000d\u000a      the US. Stevens' research findings provided evidence-based support of\u000d\u000a      their argument towards decriminalisation. Significantly, Stevens was\u000d\u000a      invited to discuss his work on Portugal with staff of the US Senate and\u000d\u000a      the House of Representatives while in Washington in March 2011. Stevens'\u000d\u000a      research on alternatives to imprisonment has also been cited in policy\u000d\u000a      guidance to national governments from the United Nations Office on Drugs\u000d\u000a      and Crime [corrob 5.7], further evidencing its impact on an\u000d\u000a      international level.\u000d\u000a    Impact on the work of campaigning organisations:\u000d\u000a    Stevens' research has influenced the work of a prominent movement for\u000d\u000a      drug policy reform in the US (the Drug Policy Alliance) that has taken up\u000d\u000a      his recommendations to avoid net-widening in QCT [corrob 5.8].\u000d\u000a      Stevens was consulted by the NGO Release in preparing the open letter that\u000d\u000a      it published in The Guardian to mark the 40th\u000d\u000a      anniversary of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

This included analysis of the effects\u000d\u000a      of national drug policies on national drug problems in Portugal (where\u000d\u000a      drug use was decriminalised in 2001). Research was based on interviews\u000d\u000a      with key stakeholders [see references 3.1, 3.2] and a\u000d\u000a      multi-national evaluation of QCT for drug-dependent offenders using the\u000d\u000a      European Addiction Severity Index [ref 3.5] led by Stevens from\u000d\u000a      2001 to 2004 (the `QCT Europe' project). The key findings have been that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Decriminalisation does not necessarily lead to increased rates of\u000d\u000a        illicit drug use.\u000d\u000a      Decriminalisation facilitates the implementation of a public health\u000d\u000a        approach, which has reduced deaths and HIV infections in Portugal.\u000d\u000a      Ethically sound drug treatment motivated by the criminal justice\u000d\u000a        system can be effective in treating drug dependence among offenders.\u000d\u000a      Risks of net-widening must be considered in policy development and\u000d\u000a        implementation, with the aim of policy to reduce the number of\u000d\u000a        individuals who come into contact with the criminal justice system.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These findings are important because drug policy is often decided on the\u000d\u000a      basis of ideological bias and power inequalities, as shown by Stevens'\u000d\u000a      systematic and comparative reviews of drug policy [ref 3.3]:\u000d\u000a      without Stevens' work on Portuguese decriminalisation, there would be no\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed evidence available to refute widely disseminated suggestions\u000d\u000a      that the policy has either been an uncomplicated `resounding success' or a\u000d\u000a      `disastrous failure' [ref 3.1].\u000d\u000a    Stevens' research has hence provided a basis for evidence-based policy in\u000d\u000a      this contentious area of policy-making. By considering the relative\u000d\u000a      efficacy of criminal justice, health and welfare policies in reducing drug\u000d\u000a      problems [ref 3.3 and 3.6], it has demonstrated that the potential\u000d\u000a      effects of a punitive criminal justice approach are limited, but that\u000d\u000a      health and - in particular - welfare policy approaches are more promising\u000d\u000a      in terms of harm reduction.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4666","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The body of research has challenged the way NHS resources are allocated\u000d\u000a      on philosophical,\u000d\u000a      technical and empirical grounds.

The Plymouth team were Prof\u000d\u000a      Sheena Asthana\u000d\u000a      (1995-to present), Dr Alex Gibson (2005-present), Dr Joyce Halliday\u000d\u000a      (2000-to present), Dr Paul\u000d\u000a      Hewson (2004-to present); with Prof. Trevor Bailey University of Exeter,\u000d\u000a      Prof. Graham Moon\u000d\u000a      University of Portsmouth then Southampton and Dr Chris Dibben University\u000d\u000a      of St Andrews. The\u000d\u000a      impact reported here relates to the research contribution of the Plymouth\u000d\u000a      staff within this\u000d\u000a      programme.\u000d\u000a    The research programme dates from 1999 to the present and rests on\u000d\u000a      methodological and\u000d\u000a      technical expertise in the analysis of large data sets and in the linkage\u000d\u000a      of different datasets to\u000d\u000a      common units of analysis. A particular focus has been the use of\u000d\u000a      techniques to develop robust\u000d\u000a      methods for estimating the prevalence of specific diseases and disease\u000d\u000a      risk factors. An important\u000d\u000a      part of the research includes an examination of the ways in which new\u000d\u000a      methods can inform\u000d\u000a      systems of resource allocation and equity auditing.\u000d\u000a    This research has its origins in an ESRC-funded project (1999-2001) that\u000d\u000a      looked at practice-level\u000d\u000a      estimates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the UK and compared these\u000d\u000a      estimates to activity\u000d\u000a      data. It found that hospitalisation and surgical intervention rates were\u000d\u000a      higher than would be\u000d\u000a      expected when practices were socially disadvantaged, while activity rates\u000d\u000a      fell off dramatically with\u000d\u000a      age and appeared to be suppressed in rural areas. The findings led the\u000d\u000a      team to question the\u000d\u000a      implicit assumption that, because urban deprived (but young) populations\u000d\u000a      suffer profound health\u000d\u000a      inequalities, they have a greater claim on NHS resources. At the time, the\u000d\u000a      possibility that\u000d\u000a      demographically ageing rural and\/or coastal areas might have a legitimate\u000d\u000a      need for more\u000d\u000a      resources was rarely given serious consideration.\u000d\u000a    One of the consistent findings of the research is that, because rural\u000d\u000a      areas are less deprived on\u000d\u000a      average, they receive less funding (per capita) for health and local\u000d\u000a      government services. Yet,\u000d\u000a      because they have older populations, they are grappling with higher crude\u000d\u000a      burdens of illness and\u000d\u000a      disability. The team has worked with a range of bodies (including Cornwall\u000d\u000a      and Isles of Scilly\u000d\u000a      Health Authority, Rural Health Allocations Forum, South West Public Health\u000d\u000a      Observatory and the\u000d\u000a      Rural Services Partnership) to examine potential mismatches between need\u000d\u000a      and resource\u000d\u000a      allocation; and to offer innovative solutions to the difficulties of\u000d\u000a      achieving economies of scale.\u000d\u000a      Further research found that PCTs serving the most rural and least deprived\u000d\u000a      populations were\u000d\u000a      significantly more likely to be in financial deficit, reinforcing the\u000d\u000a      hypothesis that the resource\u000d\u000a      allocation formula responded well to the needs of urban populations, but\u000d\u000a      failed to reflect the higher\u000d\u000a      crude needs of older affluent populations. Very recent research has shown\u000d\u000a      that hospitals serving\u000d\u000a      catchments that are demographically older and receive lower allocations\u000d\u000a      have significantly higher\u000d\u000a      standardised hospital mortality rates.\u000d\u000a    In 2007, the researchers were funded by Department of Health\/NIHR to\u000d\u000a      undertake a feasibility\u000d\u000a      study examining whether direct (epidemiological evidence) could be used as\u000d\u000a      a basis for setting\u000d\u000a      health care capitations (Asthana et al, 2008). Following this, the team\u000d\u000a      was commissioned to\u000d\u000a      develop the Practice-based Commissioning formula for Mental Health.\u000d\u000a    Prof Asthana and Dr. Gibson at Plymouth used this expertise to examine\u000d\u000a      formula funding in other\u000d\u000a      sectors, most notably the Local Government Four-Block model which is used\u000d\u000a      to allocate &#163;29billion\u000d\u000a      from central to local government in the UK. This complex formula-based\u000d\u000a      funding mechanism\u000d\u000a      aimed to ensure that all local authorities are able to provide individuals\u000d\u000a      with a broadly comparable\u000d\u000a      level of public service. Previous objections were based on charges of\u000d\u000a      complexity, lack of\u000d\u000a      transparency and unaccountable political interference. In 2008, Gibson and\u000d\u000a      Asthana produced a\u000d\u000a      report that, drawing attention to methodological shortcomings, explained\u000d\u000a      why the resulting\u000d\u000a      distribution of the grant was both arbitrary and inequitable.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4667","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    On the basis of the findings of the research, the Plymouth DAAT developed\u000a      new ways of approaching public injecting in the City. The changes have\u000a      included deploying primary care services in hostels, reducing the size of\u000a      the standard issues of syringe packs to reduce discards, introducing\u000a      injecting bins in new sites and targeting outreach work to new locations.\u000a      The DAAT publically stated the changes introduced as a result of the\u000a      research to be: `... a really cost effective way of finding out about\u000a        the problem in detail and using that detail to bring about effective\u000a        changes to policy and practice'. The research and recommendations\u000a      have enabled Plymouth DAAT to better target services and develop policies\u000a      that are likely to mitigate rather than increase risks by reducing waste &#8212;\u000a      both in terms of discarded equipment and services that are not needed or\u000a      inappropriately sited &#8212; and develop partnerships and practices designed to\u000a      reduce deaths associated with public injecting. They have also used the\u000a      research to reach out to hidden and at risk populations. At a local level\u000a      it has reduced the harm to public injectors as there is now a better\u000a      understanding of the specific local issues that increase risks.\u000a    On the basis of this research the NHS Plymouth Public Health Directorate\u000a      signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Plymouth University to develop\u000a      research, teaching and training and helped secure the post-doctoral\u000a      employment of Stephen Parkin (Jan 2010 through to March 2012 when Parkin\u000a      left Plymouth) in a newly developed and resourced Drug and Alcohol\u000a      Research Unit under the Directorship of Coomber. DARU was built into the\u000a      Memorandum as an explicit area to be supported in a collaborative way. The\u000a      Memorandum commits both organisations to develop Public Health careers and\u000a      education pathways, as well as broaden and deepen educational, research\u000a      and enterprise. The Memorandum has led to a range of public health courses\u000a      and research opportunities such as degree level modules run by Public\u000a      Health.\u000a    Dissemination of the results from the first project (in Plymouth)\u000a      resulted in greater awareness of public injecting practices and led to two\u000a      new (Barking &amp; Dagenham, and Southend-on-Sea) pieces of commissioned\u000a      research to focus on those localities. Change of practice and attitude\u000a      towards public injectors and public injecting by local DAATs and other\u000a      stakeholders in each of the areas has since been implemented and\u000a      evidenced.\u000a    In Southend-on-Sea the research has led to similar benefits around\u000a      managing the environmental risk and the planning of services and strategy.\u000a      The Southend DAAT Manager stated that:\u000a    `Instigated by the research and continued post-research was both\u000a        better situational monitoring of public toilets by the contractor, and\u000a        importantly, installation (via both retro-fitting and at time of build)\u000a        of sharps disposals. Incidences of discards reported to DAAT have fallen\u000a        subsequent to this process and there has been no further 'bad press'\u000a        such as that immediately prior to us commissioning DARU.'\u000a    They also reported improved joint working with agencies in dealing with\u000a      the issues and a more joined up approach to injecting including a joint\u000a      policy on discards including the non-use of blue lighting unless problems\u000a      persisted and then only with a full assessment. They stated that this\u000a      would be `unrealisable without the research and the opportunity for\u000a        dialogue it created'. They stated `by necessity the research\u000a        brought some difficult subjects into sharp relief, together with the\u000a        often conflicting responses to these. Joint approaches to such issues is\u000a        more routine and relations are palpably improved.'\u000a    The research was presented at the National Conference on Injecting Drug\u000a      Use (2010) which is a non-academic conference organised by Exchange\u000a      Supplies - an established agency set up by drug workers to develop new\u000a      products, produce publications and stage conferences. Attendees include\u000a      Nurse specialists, needle exchange support workers and Addiction workers.\u000a      The presentations have led to further knowledge and debate on the issue of\u000a      public injecting.\u000a    By demonstrating that public injecting and the discarding of needles is\u000a      not simply the result of thoughtless behaviour the research has enabled\u000a      more reflexive policy development to take place that results in less harm\u000a      for injecting drug users. The finding that fluorescent `blue-lights' used\u000a      in public toilets does not deter injecting but make it more risky has been\u000a      used by each of the DAATs to specifically change policy around how public\u000a      injecting and needle distribution and exchange is approached in their\u000a      areas. It has also led to wider debate around the use of blue light. We\u000a      expect more studies to be commissioned and the impact to grow, both\u000a      nationally and internationally.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study concerns research around public injecting and risks and\u000a      has been led by Prof Coomber in partnership with Drug and Alcohol Action\u000a      Teams (DAATs) in Plymouth, Barking and Dagenham, and Southend.

Blood- borne viruses such\u000a      as hepatitis and HIV, wound sepsis, and death by overdose continue to be a\u000a      significant risk to injecting drug users. It can also constitute an\u000a      environmental risk in terms of discarded needles and can increase the fear\u000a      of crime in a locality. Very little research has previously taken place\u000a      and policies can be disjointed and service specific.\u000a    The original research study arose out of concerns that had been raised by\u000a      Plymouth City Council, Police, and the Plymouth Drug and Alcohol Action\u000a      Team (DAAT) regarding drug related litter and fatalities in public\u000a      settings. In 2006 Prof. Coomber was awarded an ESRC CASE studentship,\u000a      explicitly designed to promote impact and engagement with local\u000a      organisations. In partnership with the DAAT, the project considered the\u000a      benefits of a new safer injecting service in Plymouth. To extend the\u000a      research base, Plymouth DAAT also commissioned Coomber to undertake\u000a      research on the extent\/nature of public injecting in Plymouth. Coomber was\u000a      PI on all projects and had overall responsibility while Stephen Parkin,\u000a      (PhD Student 2006-2009, Research fellow 2010-2012), undertook the\u000a      fieldwork and most of the report writing.\u000a    The research methods included ethnography and participant observation,\u000a      environmental visual assessments, data on local public injecting sites,\u000a      semi structured interviews with agencies, semi structured interviews with\u000a      drug users and quantitative data analysis. The research produced a mapping\u000a      of public injecting sites throughout the city and understanding of sites\u000a      more associated with death and potential blood borne virus transmission,\u000a      identification of risks and factors increasing risk of death and disease,\u000a      an understanding of the impact of local policing and housing policies and\u000a      practices on risky behaviour, recommendations on the appropriate placement\u000a      of needle bins and the identification of target groups for Hepatitis A and\u000a      B vaccination.\u000a    The research found almost 70 different public injecting sites within one\u000a      square mile of Plymouth city centre. Most of the sites were not known as\u000a      locations for injecting by outreach workers, drug services, or the general\u000a      public. It also provided new evidence on the use of fluorescent blue\u000a      lights in public toilets, which are used to deter injecting by making\u000a      injecting into superficial veins difficult. The research found that the\u000a      blue lights do not deter injectors and that they actually increased\u000a      injecting related risks.\u000a    Coomber, in collaboration with Parkin, used this research to develop a\u000a      rapid appraisal approach for researching local public injecting spaces.\u000a      This led to the commissioning of two local Public Injecting Rapid\u000a      Appraisals (PIRAS) for both Barking &amp; Dagenham DAAT (2010) and\u000a      Southend-on-Sea DAAT (2011).

Furthermore, training programmes for health\u000d\u000aand social care professionals (e.g. midwives, healthcare assistants, social workers) have also been\u000d\u000adeveloped, with some being delivered by the research team alongside mothers, and some\u000d\u000adeveloped by a theatre group working with support from the research team (so far several\u000d\u000ahundreds of professionals have undergone this training since 2006).

It was within this context that the previously stipulated\u000d\u000adetection rate goals were reviewed by the FASP using NHS NSC guidelines in 2010, based on the\u000d\u000abest research available at that time. As part of the first step of the review process, the evidence\u000d\u000agathered in the research was reviewed by screening policy and health experts.

Letherby's initial research, prior to joining\u000d\u000aPlymouth, involved studies focusing on the experience of teenage pregnancy and young\u000d\u000aparenthood in the West Midlands. Her work highlighted the fact that this experience is\u000d\u000acharacterised by multi-dimensional power relationships and that pregnant teenagers and young\u000d\u000aparents benefit from specialist services that need to be highlighted within the Teenage Pregnancy\u000d\u000aStrategy and for which health and social care professionals need training. This area of expertise\u000d\u000alinks into research on risk assessment and screening undertaken by Prof. Wright and colleagues in\u000d\u000aPlymouth University Peninsula School of Medicine and Dentistry (Case study for UoA 1) and which\u000d\u000ahas contributed to the reduction in the number of invasive diagnoses procedures in the UK.\u000d\u000aSince joining Plymouth, Letherby's research has expanded to include work on pregnancy, early\u000d\u000amotherhood and diabetes and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The first project was a\u000d\u000amultidisciplinary qualitative exploration of mother\/daughter relationships during pregnancy and the\u000d\u000atransition to motherhood of women with pre-existing diabetes (Letherby, et. al., 2012a). The\u000d\u000aresearch was undertaken by Letherby and Stenhouse (Associate Professor of Midwifery) 2008-09,\u000d\u000aand showed that pregnancy for those with pre-existing diabetes, however problematic, helps\u000d\u000awomen feel `normal'. Health professionals responses are important to women's sense of the\u000d\u000aprogress of pregnancy and their feelings of bodily control and yet there is a lack of specialist\u000d\u000aknowledge. Professionals need to recognise the expertise of women and their significant others (in\u000d\u000aterms of diabetes management) (Letherby, et. al., 2012b). Following this, Letherby led the\u000d\u000aqualitative part of a multidisciplinary project focusing on improving the knowledge (particularly with\u000d\u000areference to future risk of diabetes) of women with PCOS. The research, the result of a Queens\u000d\u000aNurse Institute\/Burdett Trust for Nursing award, took place in Cornwall between 2011-12 and\u000d\u000ahighlighted the impact of PCOS on women's feminine, un\/healthy and reproductive identity.\u000d\u000aAlongside Letherby's work, Bell et all undertook three projects relating to the management of\u000d\u000ascreening women during pregnancy. Screening is an important tool in empowering people to take\u000d\u000acontrol of their health and make the most appropriate choices for their circumstances. The first\u000d\u000aproject in 2006-07 applied systematic search and review techniques and for the first time in the UK\u000d\u000acollated data on ultrasound detection rates, false alarms and frequencies of 26 fetal anomalies\u000d\u000a(Bryant, Fisher and Vicente, 2007). The research confirmed that some anomalies remain very rare,\u000d\u000aand that ultrasound screening accuracy differs for individual conditions. The researchers\u000d\u000aconducted further research in 2008 focusing on biochemical serum screening at 8-10 weeks\u000d\u000agestation for Down's syndrome. The resulting report (Bryant, Fisher and Southern, 2008), acted as\u000d\u000aa central hub of international data on the detection, false and screen positive rates for targeted\u000d\u000aserum markers. The final study in the research programme took place in 2009-10, and reviewed\u000d\u000aDown's syndrome screening strategies in the UK. The research found that gestational age\u000d\u000acontinued to be vital in the efficacy of biochemical marker screening, and that triple-quadruple\u000d\u000atesting at 15-20 weeks gestation provided relatively high detection rates at lower risk-cut-off levels.\u000d\u000aThis research specifically underwent critical peer-review according to the UK National Screening\u000d\u000aCommittee review process, including an external review by international experts and a national\u000d\u000aconsultation event.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"4679","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The research has impacted on policies and practice in the treatment of\u000d      those with IDD exhibiting challenging, abnormal and criminal behaviour\u000d      both in the UK and overseas. The beneficiaries have included policy-makers\u000d      and practitioners in health and social care, the carers who live with\u000d      those with IDD, and those with IDD themselves who have benefited from more\u000d      humane and appropriate interventions instead of punitive ones. The Chief\u000d      Executive of the Care Quality Commission states that the researchers have\u000d      made `an outstanding contribution to improving the quality...care and\u000d      support for people with learning disabilities' [see corroboration 5.1].\u000a      This is confirmed by the Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation\u000d      who writes that the research has made `a major contribution' to the\u000d      treatment of those exhibiting challenging behaviour [corrob 5.2].\u000d    Impact on government policy and legislation\u000d    The Department of Health's (DoH) 2007 policy guidance on services for\u000d      people with IDD [corrob 5.3] and the Government's policy document Valuing\u000d        People Now [corrob 5.4] both cited this research, concluding\u000d      that, `where individuals with problems are cared for in environments which\u000d      do not respond well to their needs, challenging behaviour is likely to\u000d      develop and then to remain in the person's repertoire' and `the reduction\u000d      of challenging behaviour is likely to require attention to other factors\u000d      (such as communication) than just the behaviour itself' [corrob 5.3,\u000d        p.7 and p.9]. The recommendations of Mencap and the Challenging\u000d      Behaviour Foundation's influential document `Out of Sight' [corrob\u000d        5.5] also drew directly from Mansell's and McGill's research.\u000d      Following this, and as a result of the research on Positive Behaviour\u000d      Support (PBS), the DoH commissioned McGill to contribute to a service\u000d      specification for commissioners, policy-makers and regulators on PBS\u000d      services which is being integrated with a similar specification for\u000d      services for young people with IDD commissioned from Gore (Kent, 2007 -).\u000d      Once integrated, the combined specification will be disseminated through\u000d      the NHS Commissioning Board and the Local Government Association. McGill\u000d      is also contributing to the development of guidance on PBS through his\u000d      membership of steering groups for Skills for Care and the Royal College of\u000d      Nursing. Following the Winterbourne View scandal, McGill chaired a DoH\u000d      stakeholder event in 2012 and was invited to chair a Ministerial round\u000d      table in 2013. Murphy sits on the Ministry of Justice's NOMS (National\u000d      Offender Management Service) committee on Learning Disabilities, providing\u000d      advice on screening for IDD in prisons. These interactions evidence the\u000d      influence of the research on government policy across a range of\u000d      departments dealing with people with challenging behaviour and IDD.\u000d    Improving professional standards and guidelines\u000d    The involvement of the researchers in influential policy networks has\u000d      allowed the research to be disseminated to key stakeholders. For example,\u000d      in fulfillment of a pledge by the DoH following the Winterbourne View\u000d      scandal, Murphy chairs the NICE Guideline Development Group concerned with\u000d      challenging behaviour among people with learning and intellectual\u000d      disabilities [corrob 5.6]. This role ensures that research evidence\u000d      will guide subsequent practice in health and social care services for\u000d      people with IDD and challenging behaviour. Murphy also sits on the DoH's\u000d      National Learning Disabled Offenders Steering Group (NLDOSG), which has\u000d      produced guidance for professionals from health, social care, police,\u000d      prison and probation services (Positive\u000a        Practice, Positive Outcomes). The Steering Group has also designed\u000d      training for prison officers and established IDD screening in prisons [corrob\u000d        5.7].\u000d    As a result of the research in relation to mild IDD and challenging\u000d      behaviour in the criminal justice system, Murphy was also asked to join\u000d      the Steering Committee for Jenny Talbot's `No One Knows' programme (Prison\u000d      Reform Trust), which used Murphy and Mason's learning disability screening\u000d      tool (LIPS) and Murphy's checklists for action for people with IDD in the\u000d      CJS [corrob 5.8; 5.9). The Director of the Prison Reform Trust\u000d      states the research `has made a significant impact on national policy and\u000d      practice for people with learning disabilities who find themselves in\u000d      contact with the criminal justice system' [corrob 5.9]. Murphy was\u000d      also invited to help the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities\u000d      (part of Mental Health Foundation) and NOMS to adapt the `Thinking Skills'\u000d      Programme for people with IDD: this has been trialled in three prisons [corrob\u000d        5.2]. Murphy and Sinclair's research on sex offender treatment for\u000d      men with IDD - the Sex Offender Treatment Services\u000d      Collaborative-Intellectual Disabilities (SOTSEC-ID) programme - is now\u000d      used across the UK (over 500 therapists have been trained). Therapists in\u000d      New Zealand (2009) and Japan (2013) have also completed training [corrob\u000d        5.10] and training has been requested in Australia and US.\u000d    Improving the quality of life of service users and their carers\u000d    The research has directly supported service users with severe IDD and\u000d      challenging behaviour and their families and carers. For instance, McGill\u000d      helped to establish a UK charity in 1997, the Challenging\u000d        Behaviour Foundation (CBF) and remains as a trustee and contributor\u000d      to the charity's Challenging\u000a        Behaviour Charter. CBF promotes evidence-based approaches to\u000d      challenging behaviour underpinned by the latest research (i.e.\u000d      non-institutional services, ethical use of physical intervention, and a\u000d      PBS approach) through a number of activities: CBF website, telephone\u000d      helpline (1391 calls in 2012); educational DVDs (including: `An\u000d      Introduction to Challenging Behaviour', of which 1286 have sold, and\u000d      `Self-Injurious Behaviour', of which 890 have sold) and CBF newsletter\u000d      (circulation of 5,000). The Chief Executive states `The CBF has been very\u000d      successful at raising the profile of this marginalised group of\u000d      individuals, improving the quality of information and support to family\u000d      carers... in no small part due to the partnership developed with [these\u000d        researchers], which brings together the expertise of leading\u000d      academics in the field, with families supporting individuals on a day to\u000d      day basis' [corrob 5.11]. In another example of the research's\u000d      impact on service users, Murphy has also worked on a number of projects\u000d      offering direct support by producing `easy-read guides', both as part of\u000d      the DoH's National Learning Disabled Offenders Steering Group's work to\u000d      revise prison guides into `easy-read' formats (with Mencap) and also\u000d      co-authoring 'You're under Arrest' and `You're On Trial' easy-read books\u000d      for service users.\u000d    In sum, the research has led to better standards of care for those\u000d      exhibiting challenging behaviour by changing policy guidelines, resulting\u000d      in improved quality of life for service users and their carers.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    This research on those with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities\u000d      (IDD) who exhibit challenging and\/or criminal behaviour has impacted on\u000d      public policy, professional practice, and carers' and service users'\u000d      quality of life, both in the UK and internationally (e.g. Japan, New\u000d      Zealand).

In the 1980s, following scandals in institutions for\u000d      people with IDD, the established view was that, even if most people with\u000d      IDD could be resettled into the community, those exhibiting challenging\u000d      behaviour would have to remain in hospital or prison. Research by\u000d      Professor McGill (who joined Kent in 1986 as a Lecturer),\u000d      Professor Murphy (who, aside from a break between 2004 - 2006, has\u000d      worked at Kent since joining as a Senior Lecturer in 1993) and others at\u000d      Kent has contradicted this view by demonstrating that resettlement and\u000d      deinstitutionalisation can have very positive impacts in terms of reducing\u000d      challenging behaviour, as long as care and interventions are organised in\u000d      very specific ways [ref 3.4]. In this regard, McGill laid\u000d      the groundwork for the integration of values-based and more technical\u000d      approaches to managing challenging behaviour: this later became known as\u000d      Positive Behaviour Support (PBS). This approach was developed through the\u000d      work of the Special Development Team, resulting in a highly influential\u000d      1994 book and associated publications [see reference 3.1].\u000d      Subsequent research has highlighted that:\u000d    \u000d      There is a lack of innovative residential services for people labelled\u000d        as challenging, with early intervention programmes not widely available\u000d        [ref 3.1; 3.4].\u000d      Services for people with more severe IDD can be set up and sustained\u000d        in the community, provided Positive Behaviour Support is employed [ref\u000d          3.1].\u000d      Extended training in Positive Behaviour Support is associated with\u000d        improvements in staff knowledge of challenging behaviour, the\u000d        attributions they made of its causes and their emotional and practical\u000d        responses, with research by McGill and Bradshaw (who\u000d        joined Kent in 1995 as a Teaching Fellow becoming a Lecturer in 1998,\u000d        working until 2003 prior to returning in 2010) demonstrating the\u000d        effectiveness of staff training in PBS [ref 3.3; 3.5].\u000d      Challenging behaviour amongst people with mild IDD often brings them\u000d        into contact with the Criminal Justice System (CJS). Research by Murphy\u000d        and Mason using an innovative learning disability screening tool (LIPS)\u000d        has revealed a significant minority (around 7%) of those on probation\u000d        have IDD [ref 3.2], with estimates for prison populations being\u000d        similar.\u000d      Those with IDD are significantly disadvantaged in police stations,\u000d        courts, prisons and on probation, having difficulty understanding\u000d        complex justice procedures, written documents and forms [ref 3.2].\u000d        This is likely to affect the effectiveness of time spent in the CJS: for\u000d        example, those on probation with IDD appear to have been in prison more\u000d        than their counterparts.\u000d      Serious offenders with IDD, such as those committing arson and sex\u000d        offences, can be successfully treated through cognitive behavioural\u000d        interventions [ref 3.6].\u000d    \u000d    In sum, the research shows that challenging behaviour among those with\u000d      IDD can be managed effectively through a combination of resettlement,\u000d      Positive Behaviour Support, cognitive behavioural treatment and\u000d      appropriate intervention.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4683","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research demonstrated how the creation of supportive services and a\u000a      helpful policy context\u000a      might allow people with IDD to lead more included lives within the\u000a      community. These insights have\u000a      been embedded in practice through close working with national charities\u000a      (e.g. United Response,\u000a      Mencap). Impact has extended beyond the UK, to other parts of Europe and\u000a      to Australia. The key\u000a      impacts can be summarised as follows:\u000a    Influencing and informing policy and public debate:\u000a    The research fundamentally challenged the assumptions about the needs of\u000a      those with IDD held\u000a      by policy-makers and professionals. Most significantly, research on\u000a      deinstitutionalisation has\u000a      provided evidence supporting the argument that all people with\u000a      disabilities have the same human\u000a      rights as everyone else, including the right to a life in the community,\u000a      free from segregation and\u000a      discrimination. This helped shift the policy discourse in the UK. Notably,\u000a      Mansell (CBE for services\u000a      to IDD, January 2012) wrote the Department of Health's 2007 policy\u000a      guidance on services for\u000a      people with IDD which was acclaimed by the Parliamentary Under Secretary\u000a      of State for Care\u000a      Services as `invaluable' in ensuring `that people with additional and\u000a      complex needs are\u000a      appropriately cared for so that their needs are well managed and they lead\u000a      fulfilling lives' [see\u000a        corroboration 5.1]. The Mansell Report's recommendations were\u000a      reiterated in the Government's\u000a      policy document Valuing People Now [corrob 5.2] and, in the\u000a      wake of the Winterbourne View\u000a      scandal, in the Department of Health's `Transforming Care: a National\u000a        Response to Winterbourne\u000a        View Hospital [corrob 5.3]. The last long-stay NHS hospital\u000a      for those with IDD subsequently closed\u000a      in 2009. Such policy influence has been evident elsewhere. For example,\u000a      the research features\u000a      strongly in recent Irish reports on the use of congregate settings,\u000a      leading to a new system of\u000a      service provision and individualised support in Ireland [see corrob\u000a        5.4]. Those involved in the\u000a      Health Services Executive (HSE) Congregated Settings Report in Ireland\u000a      attest that the research\u000a      `has been central to the national discourse on optimal supports for\u000a      people with disabilities' [corrob.\u000a        5.5]. This research has also had significant impact on the work of\u000a      campaign groups fighting for the\u000a      rights of those with IDD. The Policy Officer of the European Network on\u000a      Independent Living argues\u000a      the DECLOC study `has provided crucial evidence-based policy advice which\u000a      has helped make the\u000a      case for transition from institutional care to community-based\u000a      alternatives' [corrob. 5.6; 5.7].\u000a    Impact on the management and quality of services\u000a    The research also impacts on the quality of service provision through its\u000a      promotion of supportive\u000a      and skilled service provision. The research suggested exemplary service\u000a      systems need staff with\u000a      specific skills who can enable people to access the opportunities\u000a      available to them. Person-centred\u000a      Active Support training materials based on these recommendations have sold\u000a      more than 430\u000a      copies worldwide. Almost 100 people have been trained as trainers in\u000a      Active Support in the UK\u000a      and Australia, and these trainers have gone on to train staff in many\u000a      other services. In addition,\u000a      more than 500 front-line staff in over 25 organisations in the UK (e.g.\u000a      The Avenues Group, HFT\u000a      and Dimensions), Australia (e.g. Greystanes in NSW; Endeavor in\u000a      Queensland; Golden City\u000a      Support Services, Annecto, Jewish Care and Yooralla in Victoria), Croatia\u000a      (Association for\u000a      Promoting Inclusions), and Ireland (Health Service Executive and Rehab\u000a      Care) have been trained\u000a      in the methods recommended by this research. These organisations support\u000a      thousands of people\u000a      with IDD. Recent requests for training have also come from Norway and Hong\u000a      Kong. Evidence of\u000a      the impact of Active Support hence comes from across the world [corrob\u000a        5.8; 5.9; 5.10; 5.11].\u000a      Ongoing studies and feedback from organisations suggest that Active\u000a      Support results in improved\u000a      cost-effectiveness and value for money. Staff also report higher levels of\u000a      job satisfaction. The\u000a      President of the Association for Promoting Inclusion, Croatia, states\u000a      `Active Support helps our staff\u000a      understand how they can be person-centered not just conceptually but also\u000a      practically in the way\u000a      they provide direct support' [corrob 5.8]. This has resulted in the\u000a      adoption of a new model for care\u000a      services for those with IDD, with `the transformation methodology, staff\u000a      training and resident\u000a      preparation ...used as models by the Croatian government to transform\u000a      remaining residential\u000a      institutions for people with intellectual disabilities' [corrob 5.8].\u000a    Impact on the quality of life of people with disabilities\u000a    Through changing policy, attitudes and staff practices, the research has\u000a      contributed to a clearly-\u000a      documented improvement in quality of life for people with disabilities\u000a      [e.g. corrob 5.12]. The\u000a      particular impact of Active Support on quality of life is also well\u000a      documented in the research\u000a      literature. However, the strongest evidence of the impact of Active\u000a      Support comes from\u000a      organisations and individuals who have taken it up [corrob 5.8, 5.9,\u000a        5.10, 5.11, 5.13]. The\u000a      Managing Director of United Response reports it has allowed those with IDD\u000a      `to develop a range of\u000a      relationships with other people, leading to increased wellbeing...their\u000a      physical health...and\u000a      emotional wellbeing has improved' [corrob 5.9]. In Australia, the\u000a      CEO of Greystanes, who support\u000a      those with the most profound disabilities, similarly confirms that `we\u000a      have seen, in the short time\u000a      that we have initiated person-centred active support...enormous impact on\u000a      the lives of people with\u000a      disability...[it] enables participation, choice and inclusion' [corrob\u000a        5.11].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research on deinstitutionalisation and high quality community-based\u000a      services has helped\u000a      transform the political and public debate, informing the management of\u000a      services and improving the\u000a      quality of life of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities\u000a      (IDD) by changing the\u000a      practices and attitudes of staff.

In\u000a        2004, for example, there\u000a        were at least 2500 institutions (with between 31 and 5700 people) across\u000a        the 25 European\u000a        countries studied [ref 3.5]. The Deinstitutionalisation and\u000a          Community Living: Outcomes and\u000a          Costs (DECLOC) project [ref 3.6] further collated\u000a        information on the situation of 28 nations,\u000a        revealing at least one million people with disabilities were still\u000a        living in large, congregate\u000a        settings in 2007.\u000a       Institutionalisation of those with IDD results in reductions in\u000a        quality of life. The lives of those\u000a        living in large institutions were characterised by hours of inactivity,\u000a        disempowerment,\u000a        boredom and isolation [ref 3.5; 3.6].\u000a       Small-scale, dispersed community settings provide the best quality of\u000a        life for people with\u000a        IDD [ref 3.2; 3.3]. There are few advantages, and many\u000a        disadvantages to clustered settings\u000a        especially for people with severe and complex needs [ref 3.3].\u000a        Evidence also showed that\u000a        small-scale settings improve social networks and friendships; aid\u000a        adaptive behaviour;\u000a        improve family satisfaction and enhance person choice and autonomy.\u000a        However,\u000a        challenging behaviour, the use of psychotropic medication and mortality\u000a        are not necessarily\u000a        improved by community living.\u000a       Being in a small `ordinary' community dwelling is a necessary but not\u000a        sufficient condition for\u000a        improved quality of life: staff care practices are also critical [ref\u000a          3.4]. It was found that if staff\u000a        employ an enabling style of interaction known as Person-centred Active\u000a        Support, then\u000a        people with IDD experience increased independence, social integration,\u000a        choice and control\u000a        [ref 3.4].\u000a    \u000a    The research provided a wide-ranging assessment of the outcomes in\u000a      different residential settings\u000a      for people with IDD. In suggesting that community-based services provide\u000a      greater benefit to adults\u000a      with IDD than large residential institutions, the research has clear\u000a      implications for policy and\u000a      practice. Resulting publications highlight the importance of creative\u000a      solutions to IDD care and\u000a      advocated policies promoting inclusion rather than incarceration and\u000a      institutionalisation [ref 3.6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5821","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact achieved by this research covers local, regional and national\u000d\u000a      levels of governance, a range of UK government departments and a variety\u000d\u000a      of public and voluntary sector bodies. It can also be situated within\u000d\u000a      Northumbria University's strong regional mission to: `collaborate with\u000d\u000a      universities and other organisations in the North East to improve the\u000d\u000a      reputation and sustainability of the Region'. The impact was underpinned\u000d\u000a      by three important factors:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The case study author's extensive research expertise in local and\u000d\u000a        regional governance, his reputation for engaging with policy-makers and\u000d\u000a        his long-term involvement in regional partnerships ensured that a range\u000d\u000a        of sub-national and national decision-makers were open to the\u000d\u000a        implementation of new ideas. The impact of the work, and Shaw's\u000d\u000a        role within this, was noted in the letter sent by the Administrator of\u000d\u000a        the Millfield House Foundation to the Vice Chancellor of Northumbria\u000d\u000a        University: `The Trustees were particularly impressed with the impact\u000d\u000a          on (the Department of) Communities and Local Government and\u000d\u000a          Civil Servants from other departments, which must be a first for\u000d\u000a          anyone in the North East' (Source 1).\u000a\u000d\u000a      The timeliness of the research was also important, as it was aimed to\u000d\u000a        influence the shape and character of the post-regionalist framework by\u000d\u000a        bringing forward practical proposals before new arrangements were `set\u000d\u000a        in stone'. Given this chronology, the research was the first in-depth\u000d\u000a        empirical study of the implications of this major change in English\u000d\u000a        governance after 2010. Its policy importance was in capturing a wide\u000d\u000a        range of stakeholder views in a single authoritative source. The former\u000d\u000a        Director of The Government Office for the North East offers the view\u000d\u000a        that: `You and colleagues accurately described the changes that took\u000d\u000a          place arising from the election of the Coalition Government in 2010.\u000d\u000a          You also summarised the various shades of opinion that could be found\u000d\u000a          amongst the public, private and voluntary sectors' (Source 2).\u000a\u000d\u000a      The research adopted a `co-production' model which aimed to engage\u000d\u000a        policy makers and practitioners from the outset in identifying and\u000d\u000a        framing the questions that need to be addressed. This approach provided\u000d\u000a        a discursive space for discussion, an explicitly practical focus to the\u000d\u000a        work and ensured that the research findings were of direct relevance to\u000d\u000a        policy development.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a      The research underpinned and made a distinct and material contribution\u000d\u000a        to public policy, particularly in relation to how a range of national\u000d\u000a        and sub-national decision-makers responded to the changes in regional\u000d\u000a        governance after 2010:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a      The finding that there was a need to develop a new flexible\u000d\u000a          network that linked Whitehall and the region was accepted and\u000d\u000a        taken forward by senior national civil servants to the extent that a\u000d\u000a        new, Cross-Governmental group was set up, chaired by the Director of\u000d\u000a        Finance at CLG. As he notes in his corroborative evidence: `One of\u000d\u000a          the recommendations of your work was that Government set up a forum\u000d\u000a          for the departments with a presence in the North East. I took this up\u000d\u000a          as DCLG director for the North East. This forum was established in\u000d\u000a          mid-2011 and has met every quarter since, with increasing attendance.\u000d\u000a          It now has members from a wide range of departments, ANEC and\u000d\u000a          voluntary organisations (VONNE). It has proved a very useful way of\u000d\u000a          sharing information and ensuring that the different departments and\u000d\u000a          agencies in the North East are up to speed with what other\u000d\u000a          organisations are doing' (Source 3).\u000d\u000a      \u000aRecent meetings of the Cross-Government Group have included a\u000d\u000a        focus on education policy (including academies), innovation and changes\u000d\u000a        in welfare benefits (Cross-Government Group agenda and minutes: Source\u000a          4). For one BIS civil servant: `The research influenced the\u000d\u000a          development of emerging regional engagement strategy within government\u000d\u000a          departments. The meetings continue on a quarterly basis, bringing\u000d\u000a          together representatives from over 15 central Government departments\u000d\u000a          and agencies with a footprint or activity within the North East. It\u000d\u000a          provides a useful forum to share updates on policy developments and\u000d\u000a          shared agendas, as well as an informal opportunity to develop closer\u000d\u000a          working arrangements on office locations, civil service employment,\u000d\u000a          the take up of apprenticeships and future policy initiatives' (Source\u000a          5).\u000a\u000d\u000a      The research finding that the localism agenda offered new creative\u000d\u000a          ways of directly bringing together civil servants and key regional\u000d\u000a          stakeholders was accepted and taken forward by both civil servants\u000d\u000a        and regional organisations in the North East. This can be seen in the\u000d\u000a        fact that the Director of the Association of North East Councils (ANEC)\u000d\u000a        and of Voluntary Organisations North East (VONNE) are both members of\u000d\u000a        the Cross-Government Group. The Director of VONNE commented that `it\u000d\u000a          is rare in my experience to see real tangible results stemming from\u000d\u000a          policy funded projects. I wish that I could have videoed the Cross\u000d\u000a          Government meeting that I went to on Friday. It was an extremely\u000d\u000a          valuable use of three hours. Most of the major Government departments\u000d\u000a          were represented at a senior level. It was clear that they were\u000d\u000a          informing each other and joining things up. This group was brought\u000d\u000a          about as a result of the Millfield House funded work. It is valuable\u000d\u000a          and it is making a difference'. (Source 6)\u000a\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The research finding that there is still a need for regional `voice'\u000d\u000a        and for developing new more creative and flexible approaches to regional\u000d\u000a        collaboration in period of rapid change was accepted by a wide range\u000d\u000a      of individuals and organisations involved in the original research. As a\u000d\u000a      result of this, the Association of North East Councils (ANEC) directly\u000d\u000a      commissioned Keith Shaw, in late 2012, to examine the potential impacts of\u000d\u000a      greater Scottish autonomy on the wider North (both the North East and\u000d\u000a      Cumbria). The research adopted a similar co-production model to the\u000d\u000a      initial research in examining similar opportunities for flexible\u000d\u000a      networking outside formal structures and was particularly focused on\u000d\u000a      assessing greater opportunities for business collaboration and\u000d\u000a      joint-approaches by local economic development bodies on both sides of the\u000d\u000a      border.

There were also concerns\u000d\u000a        relating to the loss of resources, strategic thinking and analytical\u000d\u000a        capacity.\u000d\u000a      Nostalgia should be avoided at all costs. It was important to look for\u000d\u000a        opportunities within the new sub-national arrangements and not forget\u000d\u000a        that the `old' system of governance was itself flawed.\u000d\u000a      While some interventions are best done at the local level, the\u000d\u000a        research concluded that there is still a need to retain cooperation and\u000d\u000a        collaboration on a `larger than local' basis for functions including\u000d\u000a        skills, economic development, housing, transport, public health,tourism\u000d\u000a        and culture.\u000d\u000a      The nature of the relationship between the local level and Whitehall\u000d\u000a        under the new arrangements is still evolving. Whitehall wants to have a\u000d\u000a        supporting role, providing advice and feedback rather than top-down\u000d\u000a        guidance or direction. In particular, the research argued that there are\u000d\u000a        clear advantages for organisations based in the regions to develop more\u000d\u000a        direct links with government departments rather than having to\u000d\u000a        work through the regional tier.\u000d\u000a      Finally, the research found that there are a number of opportunities\u000d\u000a        for innovation at the sub-regional level and potentially fewer\u000d\u000a        constraints under the new arrangements. LEPs provide an opportunity for\u000d\u000a        economic and labour market development and should develop according to\u000d\u000a        local needs. There are also opportunities for the North of England to\u000d\u000a        configure new relationships across existing boundaries, such as on a\u000d\u000a        pan-northern basis or, more importantly, through collaborative\u000d\u000a        approaches with a reinvigorated Scotland.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In terms of understanding sub-national change, the key finding of the\u000d\u000a      research was that the abolition of regional development bodies in\u000d\u000a      the North did not invalidate the concept of regional development\u000d\u000a      or its significance as a level of policy co-ordination. The\u000d\u000a      research also found clear evidence of the emergence of a Common-Sense\u000d\u000a        Regionalism - which recognised that, while the North East needed to\u000d\u000a      respond to the new environment by taking advantage of any new\u000d\u000a      opportunities and innovative ways of working, some form of co-ordination\u000d\u000a      and integration at the regional level is still required. Such a response\u000d\u000a      confirmed the continuing importance of flexible decentralised `networks'\u000d\u000a      within a system of multi-level governance, despite the intentions of\u000d\u000a      central government structural changes.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5823","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The findings from Harding's 2001 study resulted in Newcastle City\u000a        Council providing more\u000a        resources for mediation when a young person is asked to leave the family\u000a        home. A key finding &#8212;\u000a      that one service was seeing only 15% of the young people who had been\u000a      re-housed &#8212; led to the\u000a      workers from this service being relocated into the homelessness section in\u000a      order to provide support\u000a      at the point where a young person approaches the local authority as\u000a      homeless. Mediation services\u000a      and support at the point of the homelessness application continue to be\u000a      provided today. The\u000a      continued influence of Harding's initial findings is still apparent in the\u000a      manner in which the local\u000a      authority and other agencies continue to seek to provide housing support\u000a      to young people at the\u000a      earliest possible opportunity. Most recently there has been the\u000a      introduction of a new system of\u000a      housing assessment for people in the care of the local authority from\u000a      October 2012 and the\u000a      appointment of two workers to provide intensive support to this group from\u000a      April 2013.\u000a    The report for the Origins of Poverty project influenced debates\u000a        about homelessness within the\u000a        Cyrenians (Source 1). It was used in training with new\u000a      members of staff of the Cyrenians and key\u000a      issues were discussed at board and senior management meetings. The most\u000a      important finding was\u000a      that people who had been in local authority care were substantially\u000a      over-represented among the\u000a      sample of homeless people, suggesting particular difficulties in the\u000a      transition to adulthood for this\u000a      group. The research was also discussed at the Sunderland Homelessness\u000a      Strategy event in\u000a      December 2011 and the North Tyneside Homelessness Prevention Forum in\u000a      January 2012.\u000a    The EUROCITIES Peer Review of homelessness services in Newcastle led by\u000a      Harding identified\u000a        good practice that was used to inform the work of delegates from\u000a        Barcelona, Malmo, Munich, Oslo,\u000a        Rotterdam, Stockholm and Vienna. However, it also suggested that\u000a      there were weaknesses in\u000a      supporting the most difficult and chaotic homeless people, who often come\u000a      from a background of\u000a      local authority care. These findings led the local authority to ask a\u000a      delegation from Hamburg to\u000a      consider this issue as part of a peer review of services for young people\u000a      which took place in\u000a      February 2012 and was part of the European project, COM.IN (Source 2).\u000a    One of the Hamburg delegation's recommendations was to create\u000a      `transitions panels' of staff of all\u000a      relevant agencies, particularly housing and social services staff, to\u000a      support care leavers in the\u000a      move to independence. Harding was the specialist advisor to the Hamburg\u000a      delegation's visit and\u000a      wrote the 2013 response to the recommendations, in consultation with the\u000a      local authority (Source\u000a        3). This response indicated that greater joint planning to meet the\u000a      housing needs of care leavers\u000a      would be achieved, not by the creation of transitional panels, but by\u000a      incorporating a more\u000a      substantial housing needs' assessment into the Pathways Plan drawn up by\u000a      social workers and\u000a      young people around the time of their sixteenth birthday. This assessment\u000a      is in the form of a RAG\u000a      (red, amber, green) system which is demonstrated in one of the\u000a      corroborating documents and\u000a      assesses the likelihood of a successful transition to independent living\u000a      and the risk of\u000a      homelessness (Source 4).\u000a    From October 2012, this RAG assessment has been used as part of the\u000a        statutory Pathways\u000a        Planning process (Source 5). According to the Newcastle Children and\u000a      Young People's Plan,\u000a      there were 509 children in care in Newcastle in November 2010 - all now\u000a      receive a RAG\u000a      assessment to help formulate their Pathways Plan. The assessment supports\u000a      social workers and\u000a      young people as they plan the future move to independent housing; housing\u000a      professionals are also\u000a      involved in the planning process where their input is judged to be\u000a      helpful.\u000a    A further response to the findings of the COM.IN project saw Harding\u000a      working with Home Housing\u000a      Group and Newcastle City Council in 2012 to make a successful bid to\u000a        the Northern Rock\u000a        Foundation for a project to provide and evaluate new intensive forms\u000a      of support for those young\u000a      people in care whose RAG assessment is red (Sources 6 and 7). Two\u000a        workers were employed\u000a        from April 2013 and are providing support to a small number of the\u000a      most chaotic care leavers\u000a      (Source 8). The project will run until August 2014 and the fact\u000a      that the evaluation report will be\u000a      produced by Harding and Irving has been identified as a key factor in any\u000a      application for\u000a      continuation funding. The funding for the project includes money for an\u000a      event in the summer of\u000a      2014 to disseminate the outcomes of the project to a wider audience.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    As a result of commissioned research produced by Northumbria University,\u000a      a new system for\u000a      supporting young people in the move to independence from local authority\u000a      care has been\u000a      developed.

The staff who undertook the research were Dr Jamie\u000a        Harding (employed at\u000a      Northumbria 1995 - the present), Adele Irving (2010 - the\u000a      present); Dr Mary Laing (nee\u000a      Whowell) (2010 - the present).\u000a    In the first phase, initial research commissioned by Newcastle City\u000a      Council, and completed by\u000a      Harding in 2004, examined the experience of homeless 16-17 year olds\u000a      re-housed into their own\u000a      accommodation. The research demonstrated that young people faced many\u000a      difficulties living\u000a      independently, with growing problems of debt and substantial tenancy\u000a      failure, although\u000a      relationships with parents often remained positive. Some services, such as\u000a      helping young people\u000a      to access benefits and discussing tenancy obligations, were effective but\u000a      in other cases services\u000a      were only reaching a minority of the young people who were eligible for\u000a      them.\u000a    Following this piece of research, Newcastle City Council commissioned a\u000a      further study in 2004-\u000a      2005, completed by Harding and subsequently published (Harding and Willet,\u000a      2008), which\u000a      identified the reasons for people staying for extended periods of time in\u000a      temporary accommodation.\u000a      A major EUROCITIES Peer Review (conducted in 2010), and chaired by\u000a      Harding, reached a\u000a      positive conclusion about the city's services for homeless people but made\u000a      a number of\u000a      recommendations. Harding and Newcastle City Council also took a role in\u000a      the European project,\u000a      COM.IN, which examined services for socially excluded young people in four\u000a      major European\u000a      cities. This project made recommendations for the development of services\u000a      to young people\u000a      leaving local authority care, centring on the relationship between\u000a      different agencies. The\u000a      recommendations have now been implemented with some adjustments: Harding\u000a      is currently\u000a      evaluating the new services that have been developed (2013).\u000a    Origins of Poverty, the first of three projects commissioned by the\u000a      Cyrenians (a regional charity\u000a      working with homeless and other socially excluded people) was conducted by\u000a      Harding, Irving and\u000a      Laing in 2011. A large number of interviews with homeless people revealed\u000a      the extent of their\u000a      experiences of social exclusion, particularly the high number who had been\u000a      in local authority care.\u000a      The second project &#8212; on the subject of providing effective services to\u000a      homeless people at a time of\u000a      austerity &#8212; was completed and disseminated at events held in May and June\u000a      2012. The reach of\u000a      these events beyond the region was demonstrated by the presence of a\u000a      special advisor to the\u000a      Department of Communities and Local Government and employees of two\u000a      national homelessness\u000a      charities: Homeless Link and Centrepoint.

No other published\u000d\u000a      study of the UCS involves a large field study by a Western academic.\u000d\u000a      Strengths and weaknesses\u000d\u000a      of the Thai reforms identified by Hughes are discussed in the India\u000d\u000a          Health Report 2010 (C7\u000d\u000a      p.121), Global Healthwatch 3 (Alternative World Health\u000d\u000a        Report 2011, p. 93) (C6), and in\u000d\u000a      publications from the International Labour Organisation (C3), Rockefeller\u000d\u000a      Foundation (C4, C5), the\u000d\u000a      World Bank, and the Public Health Foundation of India (C8, pp. 17, 101).\u000d\u000a      R1 has been used as\u000d\u000a        source material for policy workshops on UHC in India organized by\u000d\u000a      Results for Development\u000d\u000a      and the Joint Learning Network for UHC. See for example:\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.ilo.org\/gimi\/gess\/RessShowRessource.do?ressourceId=18697\u000d\u000a      (Page numbers above\u000d\u000a      show where Hughes' research is cited. URLs are in section 5).\u000d\u000a    Under (2), the study found problems in implementing the UHC reforms relevant\u000d\u000a        to both Thais and\u000d\u000a        policy makers in other countries. The Rockefeller Foundation, Senior\u000d\u000a      Advisor Health, Bangkok,\u000d\u000a      writes that Hughes' research is 'useful not only to the Thais but the\u000d\u000a        broader development\u000d\u000a        community like ours' (testimonial on file). Thai policy makers\u000d\u000a      addressed the problems identified by\u000d\u000a      conducting further studies (e.g. Srithamrongsawat, 2010). A testimonial\u000d\u000a      from the Director of HISRO\u000d\u000a      says, `Evidence from the 2007\/2010 papers was a factor that led HISRO\u000d\u000a        to carry out a larger\u000d\u000a        national survey published in 2010 [that] confirmed there had been\u000d\u000a        problems in some areas. These\u000d\u000a        early studies have helped us to evaluate ... policy options in this\u000d\u000a        area, and to provide evidence to\u000d\u000a          the NHSO and MoPH in support of a policy that separates off [some\u000d\u000a          budgets]'.\u000d\u000a    This led to (3) impact via changes in the resource allocation\u000d\u000a        mechanism. The Director Bureau\u000d\u000a      of Policy &amp; Planning, NHSO writes: `The research by Professor\u000d\u000a        Hughes suggests the need to\u000d\u000a          \"ear-mark\" some monies specifically for health centres and to\u000d\u000a          prioritize certain areas of\u000d\u000a          public health activity by funding these from the centre,\u000d\u000a        and so supports a strand of policy we\u000d\u000a        have strengthened in recent years' (testimonial). This led to\u000d\u000a        more funding for health promotion\u000d\u000a        projects and benefit for rural people among the 47 million UCS members.\u000d\u000a      The substantial\u000d\u000a      improvements the reforms have made to health care for poorer Thai people\u000d\u000a      regarding access to\u000d\u000a      care and reduction in catastrophic health expenditure are documented in\u000d\u000a      the recent 10-Year\u000d\u000a        Assessment of the UCS (R5).\u000d\u000a    Hughes was invited by HISRO to join the 10-year assessment team, focusing\u000d\u000a      on evaluation of\u000d\u000a      policy implementation, and helped plan and administer research interviews\u000d\u000a      for the assessment\u000d\u000a      exercise. Hughes co-authored A Decade of Thai UCS Implementation\u000d\u000a      (Srithhamrongsawat et al.\u000d\u000a      2011 &#8212; R4), which borrows some implementation theory from the 2010 paper\u000d\u000a      [R2], and he was in\u000d\u000a      the Thai team that helped prepare the main 10 Year Assessment\u000d\u000a      (`synthesis') report (R5).\u000d\u000a    The NHSO Director comments: `Professor Hughes' past studies helped him\u000d\u000a        make a useful\u000d\u000a        contribution to our analysis, and we borrowed parts of his\u000d\u000a          implementation theory framework\u000d\u000a      for our team report. We also discuss the \"equity of distribution\"\u000d\u000a        problem in both the implementation\u000d\u000a        theme report and the main synthesis report... Another major recommendation\u000d\u000a      that was also in\u000d\u000a        [Hughes'] early papers, is to strengthen area-based\u000d\u000a          commissioning, so that there is a stronger\u000d\u000a        local purchaser to operate beside the (..) provider'. The HISRO\u000d\u000a      Director confirms this, saying that\u000d\u000a      Hughes `assisted with the [10 year] research', `took part in\u000d\u000a        the discussions about the overall\u000d\u000a        synthesis report', and `commented on the various drafts'\u000d\u000a      (testimonials on file).\u000d\u000a    The 10 Year Assessment received national press coverage. In\u000d\u000a      February 2012 the WHO Office\u000d\u000a      for SE Asia quoted the report and endorsed the Thai UCS as an\u000d\u000a        attractive model for other low\u000d\u000a      and middle income countries. The Rockefeller Foundation announced support\u000d\u000a      for a capacity-building\u000d\u000a      programme (`CAP UHC') in which Thai experts offer training on\u000d\u000a      technical aspects of UHC\u000d\u000a      to healthcare managers and professionals from other countries. At the\u000d\u000a      ASEAN +3 Health Ministers'\u000d\u000a      conference in Phuket in 2012 members agreed to set up a shared UHC\u000d\u000a      network, with Thailand\u000d\u000a      providing the secretariat for this initiative. Dr Samrit Srithamrongsawat,\u000d\u000a      formerly of HISRO (co-author\u000d\u000a      R4-R6), led the writing of the Thai health sector plan for 2013-15,\u000d\u000a      which contains\u000d\u000a        proposals for area-based commissioning and other recommendations\u000d\u000a      from the 10-Year\u000d\u000a      assessment report; he was promoted to Deputy Secretary-General of the NHSO\u000d\u000a      in 2013.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Swansea-led research on Thailand's universal healthcare coverage (UHC)\u000d\u000a      reforms (1) helped\u000d\u000a      change perceptions by showing researchers and policy makers in\u000d\u000a      governmental and non-governmental\u000d\u000a      organisations that UHC was viable in a lower-middle income country, (2)\u000d\u000a      provided\u000d\u000a      lessons about implementation challenges for other countries planning UHC\u000d\u000a      reform, and (3) led to\u000d\u000a      improved funding mechanisms in Thailand through the adoption of\u000d\u000a      ring-fenced budgets for health\u000d\u000a      centres and national priority services, and area-based commissioning.

Furthermore, the research examined the quality of life and\u000a      experience of fit and frail\u000a      older people in extracare schemes compared to residential and home care,\u000a      and its cost\u000a      effectiveness compared to residential and home care.\u000a    Swansea were the first to report that in Wales:\u000a    \u000a      extracare sheltered housing provides for proportionally fewer frail\u000a        older people than the other\u000a        care environments (residential care and home care) [R3].\u000a      older people with cognitive impairment were systematically excluded\u000a        from extracare\u000a        environments through assessment and admissions processes that deem these\u000a        settings as\u000a        inappropriate for those `who may pose a risk to themselves or others'\u000a        [R3].\u000a      extracare sheltered housing provided the conditions for increased\u000a        social interaction and that\u000a        this was particularly effective for older widows. However, the increase\u000a        in interactions did not\u000a        necessarily lead to high quality and emotionally satisfying social\u000a        relationships and had no\u000a        impact on the levels of loneliness experienced by residents [R1-3].\u000a    \u000a    The research led to eight recommendations for changes in WG guidelines\u000a      regarding the\u000a      development of Extracare provision and local RSL and private landlord\u000a      practices regarding the\u000a      provision of Extracare [R1-3,6]. These recommendations were supported by\u000a      the National\u000a        Partnership Forum for Older people in Wales which has advised the\u000a      Minister with responsibility for\u000a      Older People to adopt them.\u000a    The research on extracare sheltered housing (2008-2010) found that\u000a      several local authorities were\u000a      closing local residential care homes and remodelling the facilities to\u000a      provide extracare sheltered\u000a      housing [R3]. The introduction of WG guidelines on care-home closure in\u000a      May 2009, provided\u000a      Burholt and Phillips with a timely opportunity to examine the way that\u000a      care homes are closed, and\u000a      explore the process from the view of various stakeholders. In May 2010-Nov\u000a      2011, in collaboration\u000a      with the Older People's Commissioner in Wales, Profs Burholt and Phillips\u000a      obtained funding from\u000a      the National Institute of Social Care and Health Research to examine The\u000a        closure of care homes\u000a        for older people in Wales: Prevalence, process and impact [R5]. In\u000a      2011, this research identified\u000a      substantial gaps in local authority protocols and practices with regard to\u000a      the processes adopted\u000a      during care-home closure. Subsequently the researchers drafted new\u000a      guidance for the Welsh\u000a      Government to replace the guidelines entitled \"Escalating concerns\u000a        with, and closures of, care\u000a        homes providing services for older adults\" [R4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6409","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The original version of the Toolkit had been widely disseminated within\u000a      the UK HE sector during the previous RAE period but, since 2008, the reach\u000a      and significance of its impact has increased, both beyond this sector, and\u000a      internationally. The key benefits reported within organisations have been\u000a      improved understanding, management and intervention to address\u000a      institutional racism and institutional responses to ethnic diversity. It\u000a      thus contributed towards the pattern of improved experiences and\u000a      opportunities of black and minority ethnic students (e.g. as indicated in\u000a      HEFCE's equality analyses of National Student Survey data). The initial\u000a      mechanism for this influence, up to 2010, was the utility of the Toolkit\u000a      in assisting many HEIs to develop their first racial equality schemes in\u000a      response to changing legislative requirements.\u000a    Beyond its early utilisation, the original Toolkit has since become more\u000a      deeply embedded in frontline professional practice and continues to be\u000a      cited by many HEIs as a key resource for staff in responding to\u000a      institutional racism and diversity today. Key users include professionals\u000a      in the Higher Education Equal Opportunities Network (HEEON), and evidence\u000a      of impact on practitioners is documented in communications from an\u000a      increasing number of HEIs who have been using the material for strategy\u000a      and staff development purposes in the wider process of institutional\u000a      change. These include, for illustration, a wide range of adaptations in\u000a      local staff training guides, good practice guides and resource packs [A].\u000a      Beyond this frontline utilisation in professional practice, national\u000a      utilisation in the HE sector includes, for example, the 2009 Equality\u000a      Challenge Unit's review of the national experiences of black and minority\u000a      ethnic staff in higher education [B].\u000a    Widening the scope of impact beyond this initial focus on higher\u000a      education, there have been requests to use or adapt the anti-racist\u000a      Toolkit in other sectors too, notably from practitioners in the public and\u000a      voluntary sectors engaged in developing similar toolkits. For example, in\u000a      2008, the London Councils developed the framework concept in their\u000a      publication of Challenging Institutional Racism &#8212; A toolkit for the\u000a        voluntary sector [C]. Thus, the examples so far illustrate\u000a      the accumulating reach of impact arising from the first phase of research\u000a      as it affected the development of organisational strategies and\u000a      professional practice interventions in the UK, since 2008.\u000a    At the same time, the significance of the underpinning research approach\u000a      was recognised beyond the UK. As part of the European Year of\u000a      Intercultural Education, the Council of Europe invited presentation of the\u000a      research messages at its 2008 Strasbourg conference. This led, in turn, to\u000a      the development of a Council of Europe publication [4]\u000a      highlighting the causes of intercultural conflict and how new strategies\u000a      to address these could be implemented. The research findings thus\u000a      stimulate new debate in the field and, through engagement with key policy\u000a      actors, the development of the Council of Europe's policy and practice\u000a      approaches to intercultural dialogue on campus. In corroborating this\u000a      impact the Council of Europe's Head of Education confirmed `the value of\u000a      this toolkit in the development of antiracist strategies in this sector\u000a      across Europe' [D].\u000a    Knowledge transfer at the European level led to a second phase of\u000a      international collaborative research, through an EU FP7 project, approved\u000a      for funding in 2010 [G2]. Within this project, the original\u000a      framework shaped development of a new toolkit for the analysis of racism,\u000a      related discrimination and institutional responses, proposed for use by\u000a      the European Commission. Like the original Toolkit, this is designed to\u000a      provide target actors with clear key messages and recommendations\u000a      regarding (anti-)racism and integration. The multi-national project team\u000a      adopted the toolkit approach in 2011, which informed national policy\u000a      interventions. In 2012, 17 participatory workshops were carried out with\u000a      166 participants (including policy and decisions makers, and activists) in\u000a      Portugal, Spain, France, Denmark, Germany and the UK. Engagement with\u000a      bodies such as the High Commission for Immigration and Intercultural\u000a      Dialogue (Portugal), Equality and Human Rights Commission (UK), The Danish\u000a      Institute for Human Rights, the French High Authority for the Fight\u000a      Against Discrimination and for Equality, The Federal Anti-discrimination\u000a      Agency (Germany), and the National Office Against Racial Discrimination\u000a      (Italy) produced programmes of action in relation to institutional racism\u000a      in employment, education and the news media which are now in process of\u000a      implementation. Thus, the toolkit has been `recognised as applicable in\u000a      fields outside higher education, including the mainstream news media, and\u000a      in re-thinking and development of national governance strategies for\u000a      racial and ethnic diversity' [E].\u000a    The UK knowledge transfer workshops (in 2012) engaged representatives\u000a      from national organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain, the\u000a      Islamic Centre for Human Rights and the Runnymede Trust, who gave highly\u000a      positive feedback and are now collaborating in implementation of the\u000a      toolkit. The EU project culminated with a joint conference (Lisbon,\u000a      February 2013) involving policy makers and NGOs, including the European\u000a      Roma and Travellers Forum, SOS Racismo, Fundaci&#243;n Secretariado Gitano and\u000a      Plataforma Gueto. Further presentations to the European Commission and the\u000a      European Parliament are planned for 2014.\u000a    Beyond these European developments, the anti-racist Toolkit approach has\u000a      been adopted internationally in the HE sector. For example, `the value of\u000a      this toolkit for the development of racial equality strategies in higher\u000a      education in the South African context' was confirmed by the Executive\u000a      Dean of Nelson Mandela University [F]. Most recently, its\u000a      expanding reach was confirmed in feedback from the Associate Vice Provost\u000a      of Ohio State University, and the Vice Provost and Chief Diversity Officer\u000a      of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, at a World Universities Network\u000a      seminar (November 2012). Its significance has been acknowledged in North\u000a      America, with recognition in a recent report on racism in the academy by\u000a      the Commission on Race and Racism in Anthropology\/American Anthropology\u000a      Association (2012) [G], and in its utilisation as a resource by\u000a      the National Anti-Racism Council of Canada (2013) [H].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on `Building the Antiracist University', led by Professor\u000a        Ian Law at Leeds since 2001, provided resources for organisational\u000a      change that have had a continuing and developing impact since 2008. This\u000a      case study shows how resources developed from research findings have\u000a      changed professional practice, shaped organisational policies and wider\u000a      policy debate, thereby challenging established norms, modes of thought and\u000a      practices. The dissemination of an anti-racist `toolkit' has helped\u000a      managers in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to develop organisational\u000a      responses to racial and ethnic diversity on campus. The reach of this\u000a      approach has developed, since 2008, beyond its original focus on higher\u000a      education and into new policy domains, as well as internationally. Thus,\u000a      the evidence illustrates a process of accumulating impact on other sectors\u000a      of public policy and in stimulating debate about the renewal of\u000a      anti-racist strategies by the Council of Europe and the European\u000a      Commission. The theoretical frameworks, substantive findings and outputs\u000a      of research carried out at Leeds have stimulated attention to\u000a      institutional racism and the organisational change, using the toolkit\u000a      approach.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Leeds\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Leeds (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Leeds","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007795}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2973783","Name":"Strasbourg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2267057","Name":"Lisbon"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

In many institutions there was\u000a      a knowledge vacuum and little guidance on how to move forward. This\u000a      research project was designed to fill this gap. The research, carried out\u000a      between 2000 and 2002, was conducted by Ian Law (University of Leeds\u000a      1991-), Deborah Phillips (Leeds, 1988-2008, now University of Oxford) and\u000a      Laura Turney (Leeds 2000-2002, now Scottish Government), and supported by\u000a      the HEFCE Innovations Fund [G1].\u000a    The initial project surveyed the organisational dimensions of\u000a      institutional racism and race equality in the HE Sector, using the\u000a      University of Leeds as its case study. Email surveys of 2,000 staff and\u000a      2,500 students, plus 30 interviews with heads of schools and\u000a      administrative units were carried out together with analysis of ethnic\u000a      origin datasets on admissions and employment and documentary analysis of\u000a      policy and practice. Findings confirmed the prevalence of racist\u000a      discourses and incidents in HEI settings, with approximately 25% of staff\u000a      and students identifying these practices. Major spheres where no attention\u000a      had been given to these issues were identified, for example in teaching\u000a      and learning and purchasing, demonstrating the need for fundamental\u000a      organisational change. These findings informed the development of a\u000a      `toolkit', in downloadable PDF document format, which can be used to\u000a      assess racism across most aspects of a HEI's operations [1].\u000a    The toolkit was launched online in 2002 at a national conference in Leeds\u000a      which for the first time addressed racism in the HEI sector &#8212; bringing\u000a      together 140 practitioners, academics, researchers, community and trade\u000a      union representatives and policy makers. The aims of this event were to\u000a      translate the identification of a lack of focus on this issue into a\u000a      policy problem, to propose solutions beyond compliance with minimum legal\u000a      requirements, and to begin the process of long-term dialogue with HEIs to\u000a      achieve institutional change. 1,500 toolkit executive summaries were also\u000a      distributed in hard copy, as well as a critical case study of the\u000a      University of Leeds.\u000a    The toolkit combined research evidence with new instruments for\u000a      organisational analysis. The research included the development of a novel\u000a      theoretical framework synthesising racism, whiteness and Eurocentrism, to\u000a      interrogate HEI policy and practice. New methodologies for organisational\u000a      analysis were developed and new qualitative and quantitative evidence\u000a      generated. The conceptual and theoretical framework was developed from\u000a      that originally elaborated by Law in research funded by the\u000a      Commission for Racial Equality concerned with identifying racism in\u000a      mainstream news items [2]. The toolkit applies these concepts to\u000a      the main organisational areas of HEI activity including leadership and\u000a      management, teaching and learning, employment, research, purchasing and\u000a      contracting and external relations. The toolkit also provided a set of\u000a      methodological and management tools for investigating, understanding and\u000a      intervening in institutional racism in higher education institutions. The\u000a      toolkit was presented in the context of a set of invited research papers:\u000a      Institutional Racism in Higher Education, edited by Law, Phillips\u000a      and Turney [3]. In subsequent development, further research was\u000a      commissioned by the Council of Europe's Directorate of Education into the\u000a      causes of intercultural conflict on campus and their effects, and an\u000a      assessment of the potential value of the antiracist toolkit to European\u000a      debate on intercultural dialogue on campus [4]. This was conducted\u000a      by Law in 2009.\u000a    The wider application of the research to European public policy debate\u000a      led to the development of a collaborative EU FP7 project [G2] that\u000a      sought, in part, to extend the reach of the anti-racist toolkit approach\u000a      across public policy domains beyond higher education. This research,\u000a      co-authored by Law, Sayyid (Leeds, 2005-) and Dr Katy Sian\u000a      (Leeds 2010-2012, now at Manchester), examines the discursive construction\u000a      of racism in the workplace, schooling and the media, with a focus on\u000a      Muslims. Informed by a fundamental critique of the `post-racial' and of\u000a      the limitations of human rights strategies, it identifies the significance\u000a      of contemporary racism in governance strategies and develops new agendas\u000a      for addressing these processes [5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6410","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The EuRADE project enabled the European Disability Forum (EDF) to adopt a\u000a      new policy position on disability research, to secure new commitments from\u000a      industry actors and an investment of &#8364;2.5m for social model research in\u000a      the FP7 Social Sciences and Humanities work programme.\u000a    The ANED project enabled the European Commission to make policy\u000a      recommendations to the Council of Ministers for the reform of disability\u000a      policies in EU Member States, to adopt new policy monitoring tools, to\u000a      propose new legislation, and to fulfil the EU's obligations to the United\u000a      Nations on disability and human rights.\u000a    i) EuRADE &amp;mdash; http:\/\/www.eurade.eu\u000a    EDF (representing European DPOs) launched its involvement in the project\u000a      at its General Assembly (Slovenia, 2008). The research findings were\u000a      validated by the EDF Board, published on their website, and promoted to\u000a      policy stakeholders at two briefings given by the EuRADE team and\u000a      participating DPOs. The first was hosted by the European Parliament\u000a      (Brussels, 2009) with contributions from MEPs and European Commission\u000a      representatives (responsible for FP7 Social Science, FP7 Science in\u000a      Society themes and Eurostat).\u000a    Based on the research findings, EDF published a new policy statement,\u000a      presenting recommendations to the European Commission for alignment of EU\u000a      research and development funding with a social model and human rights\u000a      based approach, and greater support for research participation by DPO's [A].\u000a      EDF was invited to present these recommendations at the 2009 European\u000a      Health Forum and also arranged lobbying meetings with the EU Commission's\u000a      Research Directorate (e.g. its Horizontal Aspects and Coordination Units).\u000a      EDF exploited the research findings to lobby the European Technology\u000a      Platforms, which provide a framework for industry stakeholders to define\u000a      their research priorities (e.g. European Road Transport Research Advisory\u000a      Council, European Rail Research Advisory Council, European Construction\u000a      Technology Platform, the eMobility platform and the Networked and\u000a      Electronic Media platform).\u000a    In 2009, the International Telecommunication Union and Global Initiative\u000a      for Inclusive ICTs (G3ict) identified the EuRADE project as a civil\u000a      society example of good practice in their e-Accessibility Policy Toolkit [B].\u000a      A notable outcome of the EuRADE project was EU commitment to a disability\u000a      topic in the FP7 Social Science and Humanities roadmap for 2011-13\u000a      (resulting in a project call in the 2012 work programme, with a budget of\u000a      &#8364;2.5m) plus two project calls in the Information and Communications\u000a      Technology (ICT) work programme [C].\u000a    As corroborated by the EDF Director, `As a consequence of the EuRADE\u000a      project EDF adopted a strong policy statement and a guide on user-defined\u000a      research priorities to assist the European Commission's Research\u000a      Directorate General (EC DG RTD) in shaping disability related work\u000a      programmes.

For example: the Federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia\u000a      (Germany) and the Accessibility Directorate of Ontario (Canada) in\u000a      revising their employment activation policies; the Estonian Statistical\u000a      Office and the Flemish Minister for Mobility and Public Works (Belgium) in\u000a      developing rights-based indicator methods; the European Parliamentary\u000a      Disability Intergroup in requesting advice on disability benefits and\u000a      entitlements; the European Parliament's Equality and Diversity Unit on\u000a      proposals for transferable recognition of disability status in European\u000a      Countries; the office of the Vice-President of the European Parliament on\u000a      poverty and social inclusion; the European Network on Independent Living,\u000a      utilizing country reports in advocacy campaigns; or the World Bank's\u000a      Disability and Development Team, reproducing research material in a\u000a      web-based toolkit.\u000a    In 2009, presentations of ANED findings on employment and social\u000a      inclusion were invited to the official European Day of Persons with\u000a      Disabilities and as oral evidence to the European Economic and Social\u000a      Committee, referenced in the Committee's written Opinion [E].\u000a      These findings were used in European Commission staff input to the\u000a      European Council's Joint Employment Report for 2009\/2010 [F] and\u000a      referenced in EU Vice-President Vivian Reding's address to the ministerial\u000a      conference of the Hungarian EU Presidency on European Disability Strategy\u000a      (2011). The Commission again drew on ANED findings in 2012 to make\u000a      country-specific recommendations for changes to employment and welfare\u000a      policies for disabled people in Denmark, Estonia and the Netherlands and,\u000a      in 2013, to make the legislative and business case for a new European\u000a      Accessibility Act.\u000a    Impact on EU policy monitoring and co-ordination is also evident. In\u000a      2010, the European Commission requested ANED's advice to inform\u000a      preparation of its Disability Strategy 2010-2020. The Strategy then made a\u000a      commitment to improve EU-level monitoring on disability rights, including\u000a      the development of a new online tool to map and monitor progress on\u000a      disability policies across the 34 EU Member States, Candidate and\u000a      Associate countries [G]. This tool, designed by Priestley\u000a      and piloted within ANED, was launched in 2012 as the `Disability Online\u000a      Tool of the Commission' (DOTCOM) [H]. In combination with\u000a      statistical indicator development, DOTCOM provides public access to data\u000a      on more than 1,500 national policies and programmes relevant to the\u000a      implementation of the European Disability Strategy and provides a new\u000a      model of concurrent multinational rights monitoring [5].\u000a    In 2010, the EU ratified, for the first time, an international human\u000a      rights Treaty &#8212; the United Nations Convention on the Rights of\u000a      Persons with Disabilities. The European Agency for Fundamental Rights\u000a      (FRA) was tasked with independently monitoring the EU's progress on\u000a      implementation and the Commission invited FRA to develop its monitoring\u000a      activity with reference to the framework of indicators developed by ANED [I].\u000a    In parallel, an expert team was engaged to provide the Commission with\u000a      evidence and advice to help draft the EU's first official Treaty report to\u000a      the UN. Professors Priestley and Gerard Quinn (Galway) were the\u000a      principal advisors and, on the basis of their teams' input, the EU's\u000a      initial report was prepared for the EU Council of Ministers and submission\u000a      to the UN in 2013.\u000a    As corroborated by the Head of the EU Commission's Disability Unit, `The\u000a      Centre for Disability Studies at the University of Leeds has provided the\u000a      academic leadership for ANED and I am happy to confirm that the research\u000a      outputs of Mark Priestley and Anna Lawson have resulted in the\u000a      impact on our policies described. ...In particular, ANED work on data\u000a      collection and dissemination as well as the development of relevant\u000a      indicators has strengthened our approach to disability rights monitoring,\u000a      e.g. through the Disability Online Tool of the Commission launched in June\u000a      2012.'

Much of the research supporting this shift was pioneered at\u000a      Leeds (as evidenced in RAE2001 and 2008). A distinctive Leeds approach\u000a      centred on a `social model of disability' and on participatory research\u000a      methods. This involved research on the barriers to disabled people's equal\u000a      opportunities, rather than on their impairments, and engaged disabled\u000a      people and their representative organisations as active participants in\u000a      that research (particularly in the UK).\u000a    The translation of this approach to a European level began in 2002 with a\u000a      concern, expressed by disabled people's organisations (DPOs), about the\u000a      lack of `social model' research funded by the EU, or evidence of its\u000a      policy impact at EU level. This case study shows how these two concerns\u000a      were addressed. An assessment of the EU context was advanced through an\u000a      ESRC Seminar Series at Leeds in 2004 and subsequent academic papers [1].\u000a      User partnerships were consolidated with seed corn investment from the\u000a      University of Leeds Fund for International Research Collaboration, which\u000a      led to a new research programme, illustrated here by two projects.\u000a    i) European Research Agendas for Disability Equality (EuRADE,\u000a      2007-2009): the first project set out to engage DPOs as agents of change\u000a      in shaping EU research funding agendas &#8212; to ensure that social model and\u000a      rights-based approaches were more mainstreamed in European R&amp;D\u000a      programmes that impact on disabled people's lives.\u000a    The project sought to understand more about the research experiences and\u000a      priorities of European DPOs and to build their capacity to participate in\u000a      research. The methods included a survey of research engagement amongst\u000a      civil society organisations in 25 countries, critical analysis of EU\u000a      research funding programmes, and the development of a ten-point plan for\u000a      new research priorities [2]. Priestley designed the\u000a      methodology in partnership with the European Disability Forum (the\u000a      co-ordinating assembly representing Europe's 80 million disabled citizens)\u000a      and Professor Lisa Waddington at Maastricht University.\u000a    The findings showed that civil society organisations wanted to shape\u000a      research agendas in Europe but lacked the expertise, capacity and\u000a      opportunity to do so within the existing EU funding programmes, where\u000a      there was a lack of disability mainstreaming. Capacity building and\u000a      mentoring for DPO representatives (e.g. a summer school and online\u000a      research methods training) were thus provided by Priestley and\u000a      Waddington, to support them in their initiation of new user-led research\u000a      initiatives and in advocacy interventions with the EU institutions [3].\u000a    ii) Academic Network of European Disability experts (ANED,\u000a      2008-2014): the second project established, and maintained for seven\u000a      years, a pan-European research evidence network to support implementation\u000a      of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 and of the United Nations\u000a      Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Europe.\u000a    The seven-year scientific programme was designed and directed by Priestley,\u000a      with a core research team including Anna Lawson (Leeds), Professors Lisa\u000a      Waddington (Maastricht University) and Stefanos Grammenos (CESEP,\u000a      Brussels), co-ordinated by Human European Consultancy (Utrecht). The\u000a      research focused on the situation of disabled people and on national\u000a      disability laws and policies, as well as the extent to which disability\u000a      issues have been mainstreamed in the EU's own policies (e.g. in EU law or\u000a      the Open Methods of Co-ordination on employment and social inclusion).\u000a      More than 300 reports were produced by researchers in 34 countries with\u000a      synthesis reports from a range of experts, primarily from the core\u000a      research team.\u000a    Amongst its key findings, ANED demonstrated a lack of coherence and\u000a      consistency in European cross-national data on disability policies and\u000a      their outcomes for disabled people, suggesting the need for a new\u000a      framework of more systematic EU policy monitoring and exchange [4].\u000a      Proposals for a new EU framework of policy indicators and concurrent\u000a      monitoring were thus conceptualised by Priestley and Lawson, with\u000a      statistical input by Grammenos, and stakeholder consultation [5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6411","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Based on Pawson's foundational research, `realist evaluation'\u000d\u000a      provided a new lens through which to examine social programmes.

Pawson's research on\u000d\u000a      `realistic evaluation' is a key part of NICE's methods deployed in\u000d\u000a      developing public health guidance, as noted by its Director of the Centre\u000d\u000a      of Public Health Excellence:\u000d\u000a    `Firstly, \"realistic evaluation\" has, and will continue to, revolutionise\u000d\u000a      the field of evaluation on social and health programmes. Second, this idea\u000d\u000a      has profoundly changed, at least potentially, the way that social\u000d\u000a      scientists think about causation. Third, the work has challenged the\u000d\u000a      prevailing damaging and powerful orthodoxies, held widely in government,\u000d\u000a      about the way interventions in human affairs work' [A] (Director\u000d\u000a      of the Centre of Public Health, NICE)\u000d\u000a    NICE has also made extensive usage of Pawson's research\u000d\u000a      throughout its committee structure, with Pawson serving as a\u000d\u000a      member of its R&amp;D Advisory Committee (2005-10) as well as serving on\u000d\u000a      the Programme Development Group (PDG), which developed guidance on\u000d\u000a      Behavioural Change Interventions (2008-9). Pawson has been called\u000d\u000a      as an expert witness for the PGD on Unintentional Injuries (2009) and for\u000d\u000a      the revisions of the Behavioural Change Guidelines (2013), as well as\u000d\u000a      providing training and workshops to the Public Health Group (2009\/10). The\u000d\u000a      NICE Citizen's Council imparts a public perspective on their operations\u000d\u000a      and Pawson was recently invited to consult with them on the role\u000d\u000a      of evidence (2013). As a result of this sustained involvement and\u000d\u000a      professional exchange, realist approaches has found application in much of\u000d\u000a      NICE's guidance. [B]\u000d\u000a    A recent project, funded by [G4], provides further evidence of\u000d\u000a      the research's impact through professional exchange. This 2009-2011 ESRC\u000d\u000a      project was supported by NICE who seconded a senior analyst to the\u000d\u000a      project. She co-authored many of the research outputs and now plays an\u000d\u000a      anchor role in developing project ideas into official NICE Guidelines\u000d\u000a      Development Manuals.\u000d\u000a    NHS NIHR HS&amp;DR\u000d\u000a    The NHS NIHR is the UK's largest funder of research into health service\u000d\u000a      delivery, organisation and management.

Pawson (SL, reader and\u000d\u000a      professor, University of Leeds, 1990 &#8212; present) set out to tackle one of\u000d\u000a      policy evaluation's most pressing challenges &#8212; how to research complex and\u000d\u000a      multifaceted programmes, located in complex and changing environments,\u000d\u000a      designed to tackle complex and deep-seated problems.\u000d\u000a    Realist evaluation penetrates the `black box' of interventions seeking to\u000d\u000a      understand what it is about programmes that makes them work. Social\u000d\u000a      programmes work and only work through the reasoning of their stakeholders\u000d\u000a      and subjects. The crucial task for the evaluator is thus to discover how\u000d\u000a      programme resources impact upon on the subject's reasoning. Such choices\u000d\u000a      are always constrained by a range of local and circumstantial factors\u000d\u000a      (rendering problematic any assumption that existing programmes will `work'\u000d\u000a      universally). The key issue for policy makers and practitioners is\u000d\u000a      therefore to find out how and under what conditions a given measure will\u000d\u000a      produce its impacts, and consequently, the `realist evaluation' paradigm\u000d\u000a      looked to transform the basic question of evaluation from `what works?' to\u000d\u000a      `what works for whom in what circumstances?'\u000d\u000a    This research, which originated in a book Pawson co-authored with\u000d\u000a      criminologist Tilley (then at Nottingham Trent), established not only the\u000d\u000a      theoretical and conceptual basis for `realist evaluation' but also\u000d\u000a      protocols and procedures for how to conduct it [1]. Turning the\u000d\u000a      oil-tanker of social inquiry requires perseverance. It also requires\u000d\u000a      proposing, debating, refining and consolidating new research\u000d\u000a      methodologies. Pawson thus led further inquiries in which the\u000d\u000a      method was enlarged via two further books covering research synthesis [2]\u000d\u000a      and complex policy analysis [3]. In addition there are 24 book\u000d\u000a      chapters, 41 refereed journal papers, 8 articles in professional\u000d\u000a      journals\/newsletters, 10 working papers, 10 research reports and one\u000d\u000a      Festschrift, which add detail to the research strategy and provide\u000d\u000a      practical application of the method across a range of programmes and\u000d\u000a      policy domains ([4] [5] as examples). Pawson's research was\u000d\u000a      supported by external funding specifically earmarked for methodological\u000d\u000a      development on realist methods, including ESRC awards [G1-G4] and\u000d\u000a      NHS NIHR awards [G5-G6].\u000d\u000a    Methodological advances cannot be developed in a vacuum. Research\u000d\u000a      principles become honed in practice. Accordingly, Pawson carried\u000d\u000a      out a series of parallel substantive inquiries into the efficacy of a\u000d\u000a      variety of ongoing UK and Canadian programmes, positioning him as an\u000d\u000a      expert in this field. The interventions studied (between 1995 and 2013)\u000d\u000a      include: prisoner education programmes, Megan's Law, youth mentoring and\u000d\u000a      employment initiatives, urban regeneration schemes, public disclosure\u000d\u000a      (naming and shaming), public health law, NHS service modernisation and\u000d\u000a      referral management schemes. Most of these involved research contracts won\u000d\u000a      in competitive tender and through this exposure the influence of the\u000d\u000a      approach grew within the commissioning infrastructure.

[A].\u000a    Impact on Government policy\u000a    CES shaped the Government's National Carers Strategy (NCS) in\u000a      2008, influencing its emphasis on carers and employment, and subsequently,\u000a      carers of working age were targeted in many service improvements. This\u000a      impact is evidenced through Yeandle's appointment to the\u000a      Government's Task Force (TF) on Employment, as part of its\u000a      preparation for the NCS, with the aim of giving the TF access to the\u000a      detailed study findings.\u000a    The research [1,2] is extensively cited in the Employment\u000a      TF report [B]. For example, it highlights the CES finding\u000a      that 55% of 751 carers not in work wished to re-enter employment. The\u000a      research provided an evidential base and rationale for the TF's\u000a      recommendations for additional DWP support for carers, which were\u000a      subsequently implemented. CES evidence also supported the\u000a      recommendations of the separate NCS TF reports on Income and on Equalities\u000a      [B]. The DH later commissioned further work from Yeandle\u000a      and Buckner for its Policy Impact Assessment of the 2008 NCS,\u000a      helping to secure cross-departmental support for the strategy.\u000a    The Government's commitments in the NCS 2008 also included other\u000a      measures, including new DWP financial support for carers returning to work\u000a      and new Jobcentre Plus `Care Partnership Mangers', and as a result of the\u000a      research establishing Yeandle and CIRCLE as experts in this field,\u000a      the DWP commissioned the team in 2009 to deliver policy workshops to guide\u000a      implementation of these measures. The DH also commissioned research from Yeandle\u000a      to guide regional planning for carer support and inform health and social\u000a      care policy implementation.\u000a    In 2010, the research again proved vital; this time for the Coalition\u000a      Government, which used the research in its policy on supporting people to\u000a      combine work and care, citing the importance of CIRCLE's research and\u000a      evaluations for DH policy in `The evidence base for supporting carers\u000a        in work' [C]. Specifically, Yeandle's research was\u000a      used to identify the impact of working carers on employers, and how\u000a      supportive employers can play a key role in mitigating these issues.\u000a    Yeandle et al.'s evaluation of two DH programmes [3,4]\u000a      also produced evidence used in 2011 by the Department of Health, as\u000a      corroborated by the then Minister for Care Services, who stated: `This\u000a      report on the work undertaken in the Department's Demonstrator Sites\u000a      programme provides information which should inform and guide\u000a      decision-making at every level. The findings...will be carefully studied\u000a      to ensure the learning from this important work feeds into the\u000a      Department's autumn 2011 engagement exercise on the Future of Care and\u000a      Support and informs the White Paper on Care and Support.' [D].\u000a    A Carers in Employment Task and Finish Group was established in\u000a      2012 by the Minister for Care Services to develop further evidence on the\u000a      social and economic case for supporting carers. Co-chaired by the DH and\u000a      the industry group Employers for Carers, the Task and Finish\u000a        Group specifically recruited Yeandle so that she could\u000a      supply research intelligence from her team's work to inform its report on\u000a      workforce measures and opportunities for job creation in care services,\u000a      which set out the roles of government, employers and relevant\u000a      non-governmental agencies in helping carers combine work and care [E].\u000a    Impact on Parliamentary and policy debate\u000a    As an example of the research informing policy debate, following the\u000a      publication of the NCS, the House of Commons Work and Pensions\u000a        Committee identified weaknesses in the current system of benefits\u000a      for carers and the support the DWP provides in enabling carers to combine\u000a      work and care. The Committee appointed Yeandle as a Special\u000a      Adviser, specifically seeking her guidance on using the CES\u000a      research findings, which were relied upon in the private meetings of the\u000a      Committee as part of the inquiry into the effectiveness of the DWP's\u000a      existing approaches to carers. The research was also used in the\u000a      preparation of its questions to those giving evidence in the public\u000a      sessions of the Inquiry and cited extensively in the 2008 Inquiry Report\u000a      and statistical appendix [F], including a direct acknowledgement\u000a      of the contribution of Yeandle and CIRCLE to the work. In December\u000a      2008, the Government responded to this Inquiry Report, outlining the next\u000a      steps for carers' benefit reform, addressing some of the key\u000a      recommendations raised in the Report, which used CIRCLE's analysis of the\u000a      census to provide an evidence base [G].\u000a    In terms of contributing to and informing wider, cross-party\u000a      parliamentary debate, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Carers\u000a      (APPGC) also took evidence from the research in 2008. The APPGC used this\u000a      in parliamentary debates and in drafting Private Member's Bills [Carers\u000a        (Identification &amp; Support) Bill 2010 and Social Care (Local\u000a        Sufficiency) &amp; Identification of Carers Bill 2012]. In 2012, the\u000a      Houses Joint Committee on the Draft Care and Support Bill also referenced\u000a      CIRCLE's research [4] in the official Written Evidence,\u000a      identifying the effective techniques that the Carers' Strategy\u000a      Demonstrator sites used in seeking to explore different ways of\u000a      identifying and engaging with carers [H]. This Written Evidence\u000a      was reported to both Houses in March 2013.\u000a    As an example of how research informed wider European policy debate, the\u000a      European Parliament hosted an event with the MEP Interest Group on\u000a        Carers, established following lobbying based on CES findings\u000a      by Carers UK and the supranational carers' organisation Eurocarers.\u000a      By 2013, the MEP group on carers comprised 30 MEPs in 10 member states\u000a      meeting to debate and initiate EU-level policy actions and it continues to\u000a      work closely with Carers UK and Eurocarers. The former\u000a      President of Eurocarers corroborates the role CIRCLE has played,\u000a      stating that the research `has been important in informing our work to\u000a      shape the policy agenda, particularly in a European perspective. The\u000a      research informed the 2012 report of a 10-country research project on\u000a      Company Initiatives for Workers with Care Responsibilities. At EU level\u000a      the research from CIRCLE strongly influenced the development of the work\u000a      and strategic priorities of Eurocarers, and contributed to debate in the\u000a      European Parliament.'

However, a\u000a      new question on unpaid care of older, sick or disabled people in the 2001\u000a      Census, and a European Commission decision to recognise carers' labour\u000a      market disadvantage, provided an opportunity to address this knowledge\u000a      gap. Subsequent research was undertaken by Yeandle (University of\u000a      Leeds, 2006-present) and her research team, positioning them as the\u000a      leading experts in this field. While the origins of this expertise lie in\u000a      previous work by Yeandle at Sheffield Hallam University, the\u000a      research examined here, from 2006 onwards, was led by Yeandle and\u000a      the Centre for International Research on Care, Labour &amp; Equalities\u000a      (CIRCLE).\u000a    The Carers, Employment and Services (CES) study (2006-7),\u000a      resourced through &#163;790,000 of European Social Fund funding through the Action\u000a        for Carers and Employment award to the charity Carers UK, remains\u000a      the most comprehensive investigation of the circumstances of carers of\u000a      working age yet undertaken [1,2].\u000a    CES comprised multi-method empirical research: a purposive sample\u000a      survey of c2,000 carers of working age, via an innovative employer-focused\u000a      participant recruitment strategy; qualitative interviews, conducted by\u000a      University of Leeds' researchers Fry, Harris, Price and Rodney\u000a      with a sub-sample of survey participants, exploring attitudes, experiences\u000a      and aspirations re care, employment and support services; and stakeholder\u000a      interviews \/ desk research in ten UK local authority districts to map\u000a      developments in carer support, undertaken by Fry and Bennett\u000a      (University of Leeds, Senior Research Fellow 2006-2010). In parallel,\u000a      extensive statistical analysis of the Census 2001, including Census SARs\u000a      and other datasets was undertaken by Buckner (University of Leeds,\u000a      Senior Research Fellow from 2006, Lecturer from 2011).\u000a    The research findings were published by Carers UK in a `report series' of\u000a      14 policy-oriented outputs designed to maximise impact. The overarching\u000a      policy-oriented report on the CES study [1] set out key\u000a      principles and strategies for a modern caring society (referred to as a new\u000a        Social Contract for Care). This was underpinned by the study\u000a      findings on: incidence and geographical distribution of caring among\u000a      people of working age; household, employment, and health circumstances;\u000a      experiences of employment and public services; extent of social exclusion;\u000a      and occupational and industrial distribution. These identified support,\u000a      services and technology carers may need; training needs of paid care\u000a      workers; impact of caring arrangements on those who receive care; and\u000a      issues employers\/managers encounter when workers have care\u000a      responsibilities. Examples of findings included:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aOver 40% of `new' carers supported someone whose needs had not been\u000a          assessed, with no support from any service; this identified\u000a        `hidden' carers (people who care for sick\/disabled family members\u000a        without support) and GPs' and hospitals' roles in supporting carers and\u000a        developing new services to improve carers' access to information\u000a      \u000aFlexibility at work was crucial, but inadequate; however inflexible\u000a          and unresponsive services were the key barrier to combining work and\u000a          care; this identified the potential benefits of extending the\u000a        legal right to request flexible working to carers of adults and\u000a        identified working carers as a target for local authorities' allocations\u000a        of their DH `carers' grant'.\u000a      \u000a66% of male and 32% of female carers of working age held FT jobs\u000a          and many such carers struggled to cope; this identified the need\u000a        for extending carer support to male, working age and ethnic minority\u000a        carers.\u000a    \u000a    Following the CES study, the research team received 15 further\u000a      research awards, totalling over &#163;3.25 million, to pursue additional\u000a      research on carers of working age, caring and employment and support and\u000a      services for carers. The CES findings were disseminated via 15\u000a      high-profile events in the UK and presentations in five other European\u000a      states.\u000a    Also of note, in addition to CES, Yeandle and CIRCLE\u000a      evaluated two Department of Health (DH) programmes, `Caring with\u000a        Confidence' [3] and the `Carers Strategy Demonstrator\u000a        Sites' [4], which were part of the implementation of the\u000a      2008 National Carers Strategy, which set out a 10-year programme and\u000a      vision for the Government. With international policy debate about work and\u000a      care previously focused on childcare, the findings also informed UK\u000a      contributions to further research on international experiences of working\u000a      age carers, and the changing welfare and labour policies shaping lives of\u000a      working carers in Finland, Sweden, Australia, Japan, Taiwan and the UK [5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6547","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"290291","Name":"Bahrain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Improving Policing and Child Protection Practices\u000d\u000a    The research has impacted on CEOP, as well as police in undercover\u000d\u000a      operations, and has had an impact through expert training regarding child\u000d\u000a      protection practices with respect to online grooming.\u000d\u000a    Martellozzo's research with Davidson has had a significant impact on the\u000d\u000a      structure, content and delivery of the Think U Know Internet Safety\u000d\u000a      Programme.

The research was part\u000d\u000a      of a larger project funded by the National Audit Office (NAO). The\u000d\u000a      research included a qualitative element which consisted of 21 focus groups\u000d\u000a      with 84 young people (49 girls and 35 boys) in schools throughout the UK\u000d\u000a      who have received the TUK programme; and a survey of 1,718 young people\u000d\u000a      across the UK aged 11-16 years. In total over 1,800 young people\u000d\u000a      participated in the research. The study also included 11 face-to-face and\u000d\u000a      telephone interviews with TUK trainers. The research findings identified a\u000d\u000a      number of failings in the TUK programme but also identified some important\u000d\u000a      trends in risk-taking behaviour among children (1,2):\u000d\u000a    1) A high proportion of children reported having engaged in high risk\u000d\u000a      behaviour online\u000d\u000a    2) One in five young people have received a `threatening' experience\u000d\u000a      online\u000d\u000a    3) Girls appear to be at higher risk than boys because they use social\u000d\u000a      aspects of the Internet more, notably instant messaging and social\u000d\u000a      networking sites\u000d\u000a    4) Boys are twice as likely to do nothing in reaction to a `threatening'\u000d\u000a      experience\u000d\u000a    5) There is no evidence that TUK training and the TUK website reduce\u000d\u000a      young people's likelihood to share personal information with or interact\u000d\u000a      with strangers.\u000d\u000a    Building on this work, Martellozzo's further research considered complex,\u000d\u000a      multi-faceted, relationships between online grooming behaviours, risk\u000d\u000a      assessment, police practices, children's vulnerabilities and reporting for\u000d\u000a      the Metropolitan Police Paedophile and High Technology Crime Units. The\u000d\u000a      first project, Understanding Children's Online Activities: Developing\u000d\u000a        Research and Enhancing Police Practice (2011), aimed to explore how\u000d\u000a      young children from different age groups and cultural backgrounds behave\u000d\u000a      online. It was found that there are constraints to policing in the context\u000d\u000a      of online environments and that the way the internet is used varies with\u000d\u000a      age. The great majority of young people have a mobile phone with a camera\u000d\u000a      with internet access, enabling them to take and upload photographs almost\u000d\u000a      immediately. An estimated 94% of children belong to a social network site\u000d\u000a      (SNS), particularly Facebook. The great majority claimed that they know\u000d\u000a      all the people they have added to their SNS. However, when this issue was\u000d\u000a      probed, it was found that there is still a significant proportion who add\u000d\u000a      people they have never met before.\u000d\u000a    The follow up study, Understanding Sex Offenders' Online Activities:\u000d\u000a        Developing Research and Training for Covert Internet Investigators\u000d\u000a      (3), aimed at enhancing police practices to counter the growing threat of\u000d\u000a      online predation of children and increasing child safety and security in\u000d\u000a      the digital world. Training was developed on the basis of a number of key\u000d\u000a      results, including that offenders are not necessarily denying their\u000d\u000a      offence but rather seek to excuse or minimise the impact the abuse might\u000d\u000a      have had on the victim. Those denying their offence and involvement with\u000d\u000a      the online offences may claim that their online behaviour was pure\u000d\u000a      fantasy. For some online offenders collecting and distributing images is a\u000d\u000a      passion and the children depicted in the images were, for them, not\u000d\u000a      vulnerable victims but tradable objects.\u000d\u000a    Use of Pornography by Children\u000d\u000a    Horvath's ongoing series of studies on `Lads Mags' - lifestyle magazines\u000d\u000a      aimed at young men that feature young women in sexualized depictions -\u000d\u000a      focusing on their implications for men's attitudes towards women, sexual\u000d\u000a      aggression and the mainstreaming of dangerous sexism (started at the\u000d\u000a      University of Surrey and continued at Middlesex from 2010) have been\u000d\u000a      conducted in collaboration with Maddy Coy (London Metropolitan\u000d\u000a      University), Peter Hegarty (University of Surrey) and Monica Romero\u000d\u000a      Sanchez (University of Granada, Spain) and led to numerous conference\u000d\u000a      presentations and publications (4,5).

In\u000d\u000a      several cases, our interventions enabled them to secure additional funding\u000d\u000a      or to establish better and more direct links with local authorities and\u000d\u000a      other decision makers. For example, our original work with the Haringey\u000d\u000a      Chinese Centre on the needs of older people created the opportunity to\u000d\u000a      establish stronger links with the local authority which subsequently led\u000d\u000a      to commissioning of services, including luncheon clubs and advice\u000d\u000a      services, and their receipt of funding from Haringey Voluntary Sector\u000d\u000a      Investment Fund 2012-2015. (5.2)\u000d\u000a    The dissemination of projects has been used as an opportunity to organise\u000d\u000a      broader thematic Knowledge Exchange events. An ESRC Third Sector Research\u000d\u000a      Centre funded event on the sustainability of BME organisations (2010) saw\u000d\u000a      the participation of over 60 academics, local authorities, grant making\u000d\u000a      bodies and community organisations and led to various partnership\u000d\u000a      activities both between organisations and with the SPRC. Participants from\u000d\u000a      a number of organisations subsequently became regular informants for our\u000d\u000a      research projects, speakers at events and contributors to consultation\u000d\u000a      processes. The event paved the way for a larger, 2-day conference on 'The\u000d\u000a      Equality Impact of Big Society', with over 100 community sector\u000d\u000a      participants and academics. The conference included a number of thematic\u000d\u000a      workshops for practitioners on the effects of the spending review and\u000d\u000a      policy changes on education, health, housing services and on specific\u000d\u000a      provision for migrants, women, older and disabled people. These were\u000d\u000a      delivered in partnership with third sector organisations such as Age UK\u000d\u000a      and Evelyn Oldfield unit and the London boroughs of Barnet and Haringey.\u000d\u000a      Later on, a Knowledge Exchange event on 'Welfare Needs of BME communities'\u000d\u000a      (2013), discussing the effects of welfare restructuring and the future\u000d\u000a      challenges for the community sector, attracted over 70 participants\u000d\u000a      (public and third sector) from across the country, confirmed how the work\u000d\u000a      of the SPRC over the last few years has contributed to fostering community\u000d\u000a      networks and partnership initiatives and to bringing a change of mentality\u000d\u000a      among community organisations about the importance of getting involved in\u000d\u000a      and using research.\u000d\u000a    Recent partnership initiatives with Day-Mer (5.1), Paiwand (5.3) and BME\u000d\u000a      Advice Network (5.4) are regarded as models of community-based research\u000d\u000a      and have led to several enquiries and plans for long-term collaboration\u000d\u000a      with other groups, such as Barnet Refugee Services, the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Armenian Information and Advice, the British-Iranian Community Development\u000d\u000a      Organisation and Elbistan community centre. The increasing number and\u000d\u000a      variety of organisations, which have approached the SPRC over the last few\u000d\u000a      years, demonstrate the perceived effectiveness and tangible impact of our\u000d\u000a      work model in enabling local communities to gather evidence to inform\u000d\u000a      interventions which promote broader and more equal access to public\u000d\u000a      services. For example, since 2012 we have been working closely with the\u000d\u000a      Enfield Citizens Advice Bureau to analyse their client database and &#8212;\u000d\u000a      through additional research &#8212; identify emerging local needs, particularly\u000d\u000a      among new migrant communities, and producing recommendations in terms of\u000d\u000a      service delivery and development strategies. This work has enabled the CAB\u000d\u000a      to indentify and `reach out' to target groups (5.5) The work with Enfield\u000d\u000a      CAB also involved both commissioned research and a programme of student\u000d\u000a      placements.\u000d\u000a    It is however our work on migrant and BME children in schools that offers\u000d\u000a      one of the strongest examples of a thematic strand of activity whereby\u000d\u000a      impact has been delivered on several levels and with a number of\u000d\u000a      stakeholder groups, impacting upon local practice and fostering strategic\u000d\u000a      thinking. An initial study on Polish children was commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      organisation Multiverse to provide insights to be shared with educational\u000d\u000a      professionals within their network. Subsequently, an ESRC Follow On\u000d\u000a      project, `Polish Pupils in London Schools', provided training as well as\u000d\u000a      networking opportunities to teachers across several London boroughs, for\u000d\u000a      example, Barnet, Ealing and Tower Hamlets (5.6).\u000d\u000a    Our guide for Polish Parents (in Polish and English) was acknowledged by\u000d\u000a      the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/q2h43dn],\u000a      positively reviewed and provided as a resource to be downloaded by a\u000d\u000a      number of websites of Polish communities in the UK, such as the Polish\u000d\u000a      Associations in Kent (http:\/\/polskakent.org)\u000d\u000a      and Eastbourne (www.polskieeastbourne.org.uk), the Polish Newsletter for\u000d\u000a      the East Midlands (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/pk6uexp) and http:\/\/www.london.net,\u000d\u000a      one of the most widely used online portals for Poles in the UK. Working in\u000d\u000a      partnership with Action for Social Integration (AFSI), we adapted this\u000d\u000a      into a broader guide for BME parents on the UK education system, targeting\u000d\u000a      recently arrived migrant families. This was distributed and advertised\u000d\u000a      among community organisations and practitioners as a valuable and\u000d\u000a      practical tool (5.7)\u000d\u000a    We have also aimed to maximise impact by working in close collaboration\u000d\u000a      with partner organisations, including Tower Hamlets Education Services,\u000d\u000a      the Federation of Poles in Great Britain and Hackney Learning Trust,\u000d\u000a      through exchanging data, gathering practitioners' insights and delivering\u000d\u000a      presentations at public and internal meetings. In particular, our\u000d\u000a      evaluation of BME supplementary education services received the attention\u000d\u000a      and praise of Hackney Learning Trust &#8212; which had sustained the development\u000d\u000a      of such services using dedicated funding from the local authority &#8212; since\u000d\u000a      it represented the first local attempt to conduct external evaluations\u000d\u000a      involving organisations, parents as well as mainstream schools.\u000d\u000a    In many cases, work in the area of education later led to broader\u000d\u000a      interventions with BME service providers. For example, an initial voucher\u000d\u000a      for a small piece of research with Day-Mer, with over 2,000 clients, was\u000d\u000a      used to evaluate their education services (including parental engagement,\u000d\u000a      in- school tutelage and supplementary classes) but also to raise awareness\u000d\u000a      on the role of community providers in education. The research report was\u000d\u000a      used by Day-Mer to successfully apply for additional funding from the Big\u000d\u000a      Lottery, in partnership with other BME organisations providing education\u000d\u000a      services [http:\/\/daymer.org\/content\/education-services]\u000d\u000a      (5.1). Based on this success, Day-Mer subsequently used a Big Lottery\u000d\u000a      `Transition Fund' grant to commission research by Middlesex staff on the\u000d\u000a      `Welfare and advice needs of Turkish and Kurdish communities' in order to\u000d\u000a      inform service planning in this area over the next few years (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/p9x9qmt\/)\u000d\u000a      (5.1).\u000d\u000a    Findings from the study were requested by strategic forums and other\u000d\u000a      decision makers from Enfield and other London boroughs. A similar\u000d\u000a      development also occurred with Paiwand, an Afghan organisation with about\u000d\u000a      2,000 users per year and operating in Northwest London. After a first\u000d\u000a      evaluation of their supplementary school services by the Middlesex team,\u000d\u000a      Paiwand used funding from Hammersmith Council to commission a study on the\u000d\u000a      welfare needs of the Afghan community, which brought in a number of other\u000d\u000a      London-based Afghan organisations. The initiative, strongly supported by\u000d\u000a      the local authority to inform more effective community interventions, has\u000d\u000a      equipped the beneficiary organisations with better evidence, sounder\u000d\u000a      sustainability plans and stronger capacity (through targeted training),\u000d\u000a      which have been immediately implemented in additional service provision,\u000d\u000a      such as mentoring (http:\/\/www.paiwand.com\/mentoring)\u000d\u000a      and informing successful funding applications, such as with the Big\u000d\u000a      Lottery (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/nzgwkrg)\u000d\u000a      (5.3).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The increasing diversity of migrant and minority ethnic communities and\u000d\u000a      the growing awareness of multiple experiences of inequalities (age,\u000d\u000a      gender, race and religion) require appropriate interventions and policy\u000d\u000a      measures.

This led to an investigation of\u000d\u000a      how different groups face specific barriers in accessing public services,\u000d\u000a      such as lack of English language skills, knowledge of the UK system and a\u000d\u000a      general lack of trust in statutory services and the public sector,\u000d\u000a      together with culturally specific needs and perspectives. We also gathered\u000d\u000a      evidence on inadequate provision, lack of targeted and culturally aware\u000d\u000a      interventions and of `institutional' discrimination (Fundamental Rights\u000d\u000a      Agency 2013) (2) which hit differently and disproportionally specific\u000d\u000a      sub-groups, including women, children, older and disabled people. Overall,\u000d\u000a      our findings highlighted the importance of differentiating subgroups\u000d\u000a      within broader black and minority ethnic (BME) populations and of actively\u000d\u000a      involving local communities in service planning, delivery and evaluation.\u000d\u000a      As members of the ESRC Social Enterprise Capacity Building Cluster, we\u000d\u000a      evidenced how BME community providers have been struggling to survive in\u000d\u000a      an increasingly hostile funding environment, dominated by the\u000d\u000a      professionalization of the third sector and the privatisation of public\u000d\u000a      services. Hence, we explored the opportunities and challenges of\u000d\u000a      alternative practices, particularly the `social enterprise' model\u000d\u000a      (Sepulveda et. al 2013) (3).\u000d\u000a    Over the past few years, we have developed a broad programme of\u000d\u000a      activities working with third sector and BME organisations. These were\u000d\u000a      mainly London-based, but the implications of our work are UK-wide.\u000d\u000a      Building on our links with specific, often neglected community groups eg.\u000d\u000a      Chinese, Polish, Irish, Afghani and Turkish and Kurdish, we have developed\u000d\u000a      more general models of mapping and analysis, combining academic rigour\u000d\u000a      with the active involvement of community members in all stages of\u000d\u000a      research. This has included the training of community and peer researchers\u000d\u000a      (Ryan et. al 2011) (4), networking and consultation events and a wide\u000d\u000a      range of participatory methods.\u000d\u000a    Our theoretical and methodological approaches have been applied to a\u000d\u000a      number of contexts, such as health services (through a major comparative\u000d\u000a      European project (2) followed by local interventions) and, particularly,\u000d\u000a      education services. The latter started with a focus on the Polish\u000d\u000a      community, which has recently become the second largest single nationality\u000d\u000a      group in the country (about 580,000 residents in the 2011 Census), with a\u000d\u000a      rapidly growing number of children in schools (over 47,000 Polish-speakers\u000d\u000a      in primary and secondary schools). Our pioneering study of Polish\u000d\u000a      migration (Ryan L et al. 2009) (5) helped to debunk stereotypes of them as\u000d\u000a      short-term migrant workers, identified patterns of family migration,\u000d\u000a      networking and settlement, and highlighted the importance of children and\u000d\u000a      schooling amongst this group. It also showed the diverging expectations of\u000d\u000a      parents, children and teachers, and thus the need to generate effective\u000d\u000a      approaches to supporting migrant children in schools and developing tools\u000d\u000a      for families and training for teachers (D'Angelo and Ryan L 2011) (6).\u000d\u000a      These lessons were later applied to other communities (Afghani, Turkish\u000d\u000a      and the Kurdish) and more broadly to BME populations, especially recently\u000d\u000a      arrived migrants, exploring the needs of minority ethnic pupils and\u000d\u000a      parents and investigating good practice to promote engagement and enhance\u000d\u000a      achievement. Our research on migrant families and children in schools\u000d\u000a      discussed the importance of a `holistic' approach to education and the\u000d\u000a      fundamental role of community-based education services in delivering\u000d\u000a      language and culture-specific support to children and parents.\u000d\u000a      Key staff involved have been D'Angelo, Kofman, Ryan L, Sepulveda,\u000d\u000a      Vacchelli, Sales (until 2009, now Emeritus Professor).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7310","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Peer led Self-Help Groups and Organisations\u000d\u000a    Our research with and into peer led self-help groups and organisations\u000d\u000a      has directly influenced national and regional initiatives aimed at\u000d\u000a      improving health and social care commissioners' understanding of the\u000d\u000a      value, role and spectrum of self-help groups.

Four regional seminars on the core findings from the\u000d\u000a      research have ensured that links have been made for audiences of\u000d\u000a      commissioners and community practitioners between support for self-help\u000d\u000a      groups and current policy initiatives such as personalised care and\u000d\u000a      support for people with long term conditions. SHN have presented the\u000d\u000a      findings at the European Network for Self Help and are planning a national\u000d\u000a      event for 2014. The ESTEEM research has also informed an accredited\u000d\u000a      course, delivered by our partners SHN, the national specialists in the\u000d\u000a      field, at the Nottingham University's Institute of Mental Health in May\u000d\u000a      2013, for professionals in mental health on working with self-help groups.\u000d\u000a      This study is also informing Nottingham's Local Education Training Board\u000d\u000a      in supporting the NHS to integrate training on ways in which professionals\u000d\u000a      can support self-help groups. The practical application and impact of the\u000d\u000a      ESTEEM study was recognised with inclusion in the Big Ideas for the\u000d\u000a        Future 2011 report, jointly published by the Research Councils UK\u000d\u000a      and Universities UK. At the local level, Essex-based health and social\u000d\u000a      care commissioners have written initiatives that support peer led groups\u000d\u000a      into their service specifications (MIME 2012; corroborative statement from\u000d\u000a      Head of Mental Health Commissioning, ECC).\u000d\u000a    Peer\/Citizen Researchers\u000d\u000a    Prominent examples of the impact of involving service users as\u000d\u000a      researchers have been the sustained commissioning of two peer\/citizen\u000d\u000a      research groups (CRGs) and the formation in 2011 of a third group. These\u000d\u000a      groups are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The South Essex Service User Research Group (SE-SURG), a group of\u000d\u000a        mental health service users, was established at Anglia Ruskin University\u000d\u000a        in 2005 following their involvement with the employment survey detailed\u000d\u000a        in our second case study. SE-SURG have carried out 14 further studies\u000d\u000a        commissioned to inform local service development during 2008 -2013, with\u000d\u000a        support from Secker.\u000d\u000a      WhyNot!, an older people's Research Group, was established in 2007 and\u000d\u000a        built on our initial training programme for older people as researchers.\u000d\u000a        Twenty-two people completed the training, of whom 10 were founding\u000d\u000a        members in the self-organising Research Group. Since 2008 they have\u000d\u000a        carried out 14 projects as direct commissions from the County Council,\u000d\u000a        District Councils, NHS and Age UK which we have supported on a\u000d\u000a        `needs-led' basis. Two further cohorts have been trained between 2009\u000d\u000a        and 2011 (Munn-Giddings, McVicar, O'Brien &amp; Boyce).\u000d\u000a      The North Essex Research Network, a group of mental health service\u000d\u000a        users similar to SESURG, was established in 2012, following training in\u000d\u000a        research provided as part of the Making Involvement Matter in Essex\u000d\u000a        (MIME) project (2009-2012). The group has nine members and completed\u000d\u000a        several studies under the auspices of MIME, with a further two\u000d\u000a        evaluations of recovery initiatives commissioned in 2013 by the NHS\u000d\u000a        Greater Eastern Commissioning Support Unit (Secker and Munn-Giddings).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Feedback from commissioners demonstrates their increased awareness of the\u000d\u000a      positive advantages of peer research and their policy commitment to\u000d\u000a      developing peer researchers in other parts of their adult services. For\u000d\u000a      example, with our support Healthwatch Essex is developing the model with\u000d\u000a      broader citizen groups to inform strategic planning (corroborative\u000d\u000a      statement from Head of Research and Analysis, ECC). In addition both\u000d\u000a      WhyNot! and SE-SURG research projects have informed changes in practice at\u000d\u000a      a local level. For example, WhyNot!' was commissioned to research into\u000d\u000a      technologies that help older people remain in their home. The study\u000d\u000a      resulted in the Council targeting practitioner training as well as\u000d\u000a      developing a demonstration facility, both of which have led to an uptake\u000d\u000a      in the service. Similarly, several studies carried out by SE-SURG have had\u000d\u000a      a local impact, for example in supporting the modernisation of day\u000d\u000a      services in South Essex, resulting in a shift away from staff-led\u000d\u000a      building-based services towards peer support and use of mainstream\u000d\u000a      community facilities. Subsequent evaluation found high levels of\u000d\u000a      satisfaction with the new services amongst day service users.\u000d\u000a    Feedback from members of these Citizen Research Groups highlights\u000d\u000a      personal impacts including improved confidence, new skills, employment\u000d\u000a      opportunities and feeling empowered to influence change (WhyNot!\u000d\u000a      corroborative statement; SE-SURG Activity Report 2008-2013). Further\u000d\u000a      impact has stemmed from replication of SE-SURG's employment survey and the\u000d\u000a      associated pioneering engagement of service users as researchers within\u000d\u000a      the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pavia (see our second\u000d\u000a      case study). The value of service user involvement in research has been\u000d\u000a      recognised in subsequent studies carried out at the University of Pavia.\u000d\u000a    Recognition of the quality of SE-SURG's and WhyNot!'s work by Essex\u000d\u000a      Health and Social Care Commissioners is evidenced by an invitation to\u000d\u000a      Secker and Munn-Giddings in 2009 to tender successfully for a &#163;500,000\u000d\u000a      three-year initiative aimed at extending service user involvement in\u000d\u000a      commissioning decisions. This initiative, Making Involvement Matter in\u000d\u000a      Essex (MIME), was delivered in partnership with a user-led training\u000d\u000a      organisation ARW (Advocacy Really Works) and enabled us to engage a wider\u000d\u000a      group of service users and carers in research. Twenty MIME members\u000d\u000a      received training in research skills in 2011, of whom, as noted above,\u000d\u000a      nine formed the North Essex Research Network and have carried out studies\u000d\u000a      with impact on commissioning strategy and service development in Essex,\u000d\u000a      for example introduction of a helpline web chat service for younger\u000d\u000a      people. As with SE-SURG members, personal benefits identified in feedback\u000d\u000a      from MIME members include improved confidence and feeling useful and\u000d\u000a      empowered to influence change (MIME, 2012).\u000d\u000a    As well as supporting the development of research skills these types of\u000d\u000a      initiatives develop social capital and skills amongst service users and\u000d\u000a      carers which they put to use in many ways. For example, members of WhyNot!\u000d\u000a      now sit on Essex County Council's Research and Governance Committee and\u000d\u000a      have used their training in their local communities to carry out a local\u000d\u000a      community consultation that increased rural transport options (WhyNot!\u000d\u000a      corroborative statement). This highlights the potential of this approach\u000d\u000a      to build skills that can inform and impact on other democratic processes.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Our research has had a direct influence on policy makers', commissioners'\u000d\u000a      and practitioners' understanding of the value of peer led self-help groups\u000d\u000a      and the potential of citizen\/service user researchers for driving service\u000d\u000a      improvements grounded in lived experience.

Employment and mental health\u000a    Our research into employment for mental health service users revealing\u000a      that the majority aspire to paid employment has been cited in national\u000a      policy reviews (e.g. HM Government, 2009; Perkins et al, 2009) in support\u000a      of the development of vocational services that are now a central strand of\u000a      mental health strategy implementation and welfare reform.\u000a    At a local level, results from the 2004 survey of service users'\u000a      vocational aspirations carried out by Secker with service user\u000a      co-researchers, together with evidence from the SESAMI study, convinced\u000a      the South Essex Mental Health Joint Commissioning Team and senior managers\u000a      at the South Essex Partnership University NHS Trust (SEPT) of the need for\u000a      an evidence-based vocational service embedded within the Trust's clinical\u000a      teams. The service was one of the first in the UK to fully implement the\u000a      principles of the Individual Placement and Support approach to employment\u000a      support, and as such was singled out as an example of good practice in\u000a      national commissioning guidance (Department of Health, 2006), which we\u000a      highlight because it remains current and has been influential in promoting\u000a      subsequent developments in other localities (e.g. East Sussex Health, 2009\u000a      (http:\/\/www.eastsussexhealth.org\/pdf\/HOSC19March09\/Item%206%20App%201%20Day%20and%20Voc%20MH%20Briefing%20Paper.pdf).\u000a    Between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2013 the SEPT service has supported\u000a      396 service users into work and 427 into education (vocational service\u000a      performance data).\u000a    An additional employment-related impact stems from Secker's establishment\u000a      of SE-SURG at Anglia Ruskin University in 2005. As well as contributing to\u000a      further service developments via commissioned studies, the group provides\u000a      employment and skills development opportunities for members. Membership\u000a      has remained consistent at around eight since 2005, with some members\u000a      moving on to take up further employment and education opportunities and\u000a      others joining the group. Two members (Lyn Kent and Maxine Nightingale)\u000a      have achieved employment at Anglia Ruskin University on 50% FTE contracts\u000a      as service user researchers\/SE-SURG administrators.\u000a    Our research has therefore achieved both national impact through\u000a      influence on government policy and local impact in terms of improved\u000a      welfare outcomes for mental health service users in our region.\u000a    2. Engagement in creative activity\u000a    The impact of our research into the role of creative activity in recovery\u000a      is demonstrated in terms of its reach by citation in two House of Lords\u000a      debates (Lords Hansard 6 March 2008 &amp; 25 July 2013). In terms\u000a      of significance, impact on policy is evidenced by citation in a speech\u000a      later that year by the then Secretary of State for Health (16 September\u000a      2008).\u000a    The September 2007 launch of the research at Tate Modern was attended by\u000a      the Chief Executive and members of the Executive Team at SEPT, whose\u000a      support on learning of the results from the study was instrumental in the\u000a      subsequent development of Open Arts, a participatory arts and mental\u000a      health project established at SEPT in 2008. The project aims to promote\u000a      wellbeing and social inclusion through running 12-week, community-based\u000a      introductory arts courses, with an emphasis on skill development and\u000a      follow-on opportunities to pursue individual goals.\u000a    From the inception of Open Arts in 2008 to July 2013, 615 people have\u000a      completed an introductory course, 225 have achieved National Open College\u000a      Network accreditation at levels 2 or 3 and 24 now work with Open Arts as\u000a      volunteers (Open Arts performance data).\u000a    Significant improvements on measures of wellbeing and social inclusion\u000a      were recorded for course completers in the two-year evaluation study led\u000a      by Secker from 2009 to 2010 (Secker et al., 2011). These results were\u000a      recently replicated in the waiting list controlled evaluation reported by\u000a      Margrove et al. (2012). The latter study has received considerable\u000a      attention, with local reach demonstrated by an interview on BBC Radio\u000a      Essex (reach 75,000) and a full page article in the Essex Chronicle\u000a      (reach 26,327), including headline billing on the Chronicle's advertising\u000a      boards across Essex. Wider reach is demonstrated by coverage in the Daily\u000a        Telegraph (reach 555,817) and the Huffington Post UK (reach\u000a      197,964).\u000a    In 2012 the positive evaluation results contributed to a successful bid\u000a      to Essex County Council for seed funding of &#163;9,211 to establish a studio\u000a      space where introductory course completers could continue their art work\u000a      more independently for six months, with support from a professional\u000a      artist. The studio opened in October 2012 and 15 members who completed\u000a      their six-month placement in May 2013 have now formed a constituted group,\u000a      renting studio space together in order to continue their work. Evaluation\u000a      of the studio outcomes is on-going but preliminary results are promising,\u000a      with further significant improvements identified in wellbeing and social\u000a      inclusion.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research has directly informed the development of services that are\u000a      supporting recovery from mental ill health by enabling mental health\u000a      service users to:\u000a\u0009  \u000a    Return to or gain employment\u000a    Experience improved levels of wellbeing and social inclusion through\u000a      engaging in creative activity.\u000a\u0009  \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Anglia Ruskin University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Anglia Ruskin University","InstitutionName":"Anglia Ruskin University","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"East","UKPRN":10000291}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    1.

Studies focusing on mental health service users' aspirations to\u000a          gain employment and the support needed to do so.\u000a    Supporting people with disabilities to gain or regain employment is a\u000a      significant strand of UK government welfare policy. Across disability\u000a      groups, however, mental health service users are amongst the least likely\u000a      to be in competitive, paid employment. Historically, it has been assumed\u000a      that this group neither want nor are able to work, and service provision\u000a      has therefore focused on sheltered work, often unpaid, or on lengthy work\u000a      preparation that rarely leads to employment.\u000a    Secker's studies (from 2002 to the present) broke new ground in\u000a      discovering that, contrary to established assumptions, mental health\u000a      service users do aspire to paid work and are able to achieve their\u000a      aspirations with appropriate support. A survey carried out by Secker in\u000a      2004 in collaboration with service user co-researchers who subsequently\u000a      formed the South Essex Service User Research Group (SE-SURG) confirmed\u000a      that aspirations to work were high amongst service users in South Essex\u000a      (SE-SURG et al., 2006). Subsequent replication of the survey during 2007\u000a      in Pavia, Italy, by Secker in collaboration with colleagues at the\u000a      University of Pavia found similar aspirations amongst people receiving\u000a      mental health services in that region (Cirillo et al., 2009). But despite\u000a      service users' aspirations, the SESAMI (Social inclusion through\u000a      Employment Support of Adults with Mental Illness) study, carried out\u000a      between 2004 and 2006 by Secker with Boyce and colleagues from Durham and\u000a      City Universities indicated that provision of effective employment support\u000a      remained rare across England (Boyce et al., 2008).\u000a    2. Research aimed at developing the evidence base for arts\u000a          participation as a means of promoting mental wellbeing and social\u000a          inclusion.\u000a    Although there is a wealth of qualitative evidence suggesting that mental\u000a      health service users benefit from engaging in creative activity, reviews\u000a      have consistently identified a lack of robust quantitative evidence to\u000a      support the allocation of scarce resources to participatory arts\u000a      initiatives.\u000a    Between 2005 and 2007 Secker led a study with Kent (service user\u000a      researcher) and colleagues from the University of Central Lancashire,\u000a      commissioned by the Department of Health and the Department for Culture\u000a      Media and Sport to address that problem. The study provided the first\u000a      substantial evidence of quantifiable outcomes for service users from\u000a      participation in creative activity (improved mental health, empowerment\u000a      and social inclusion), as well as identifying a range of eight processes\u000a      through which those outcomes were achieved (Hacking et. al., 2008).\u000a      Further studies undertaken by Secker with Kent and Margrove have supported\u000a      these results, with significant improvements shown in mental wellbeing and\u000a      social inclusion in a two-year uncontrolled evaluation (Secker et al.,\u000a      2011), subsequently replicated in a waiting list controlled evaluation\u000a      completed in 2011 (Margrove et al., 2012).\u000a    Key researchers\u000a    Jenny Secker, Professor of Mental Health (October 2002 to present) Lyn\u000a      Kent, Service User Researcher \/ SE-SURG Administrator (June 2004 to\u000a      present) Melanie Boyce, Research Fellow (April 2004 to present) Kerrie\u000a      Margrove, Research Fellow (August 2010 to present)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7380","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Liverpool Model programme of action research developed during Impacts\u000a      08, was intended to feed directly into cultural policy work for all\u000a      Liverpool and national partners and the EU.\u000a    Impact of the core research themes\u000a    The three key elements of the research that have influenced stakeholders\u000a      are:\u000a    i) Advancement of the stakeholder discourse of what is meant by\u000a        `impact' and how impact can be evidenced. The development of an\u000a      evidence based approach to cultural impact shaped guidelines for special\u000a      event applications and subsequent monitoring.\u000a    \u000a      The European Commission (2010) used Impacts 08 to shape their improved\u000a        approach to evaluating\u000a          the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) programme (p9).\u000a      The UK Government made use of the work to support its tourism\u000a          policy framework (DCMS 2011 p12-13) and frame the UK City of\u000a        Culture bidding guidelines (DCMS 2010-11, see Broader impacts section).\u000a      The research was used to inform and strengthen practitioner claims\u000a        around the value of the arts, and to shape their approach to lobbying\u000a        for support. For example Liverpool Arts Regeneration Consortium used\u000a        this as part of presentations\u000a          to the House of Commons 30 Apr 2011. The programme was also\u000a        mentioned at the House of Lords (Lords debate: role of culture in the\u000a        UK, 17 Mar 2010) and to inform the Hansard\u000a          Debates at the House of Commons\u000a        (3 June 2010); The London 2012 Creative Programmers network (2008-2012)\u000a        also justified the value of their activity through reference to Impacts\u000a        08 (see broader impacts section).\u000a    \u000a    ii) Utilisation of specific or combined methodologies. This has\u000a      influenced the UK's and the EU's approach to evaluating major cultural\u000a      programmes. Key examples being: LOCOG, DCMS, ACE: Cultural Olympiad\u000a      evaluation framework and implementation (2011-13, see below); DCMS: London\u000a      2012 Meta-Evaluation (2010-13); English Heritage: value of the Liverpool\u000a      World Heritage site (2012-13); DCMS: UK City of Culture evaluation\u000a      framework (2010-11); European Parliament framework for overall ECoC\u000a      programme assessment (2012-13).\u000a    iii) Use of the Impacts 08 thematic framework to shape policy as well\u000a        as to set up new organisations.

The evidence for these impacts can be noted in policy\u000a      documentation and actions by a variety of stakeholders:\u000a    In Liverpool\u000a    \u000a      Impacts 08 provided the evidence base that allowed Liverpool City\u000a        Council to make the political decision to protect and prioritise\u000a        continued and major investment in cultural activity throughout the\u000a        period of austerity from 2010 to the 2013.

Dr Whyte's recommendations in the report on\u000a      corporate accountability (see section 2 above) led directly to his being\u000a      contacted by Dr Bill Wilson MSP, and then, following a series of meetings\u000a      in the Scottish Parliament in 2008 and 2009, led to Dr Whyte's engagement\u000a      in a collaborative project with Dr Wilson to develop legislative proposals\u000a      for improving corporate accountability. As a result of this collaborative\u000a      project Dr Whyte authored the first draft of the Criminal Sentencing (Equity\u000a        Fines) (Scotland) Bill (SB 10-54) and co-authored the\u000a      statutory parliamentary consultation document that accompanied this Bill.\u000a      The Bill was introduced and debated at the committee stages of the\u000a      Scottish Parliament on the 1st June 2010.

This knowledge exchange began with\u000a      mass dissemination of publication 4 cited above. This included large scale\u000a      purchases of book by UNISON (200 copies) and GMB (500 copies) for\u000a      distribution to members. This dissemination activity led directly to a\u000a      number of invitations to give keynote speeches at national events\u000a      organised by UCATT, UNISON and GMB, as well as the following high profile\u000a      keynote and plenary speeches in other labour movement fora:\u000a      keynote speech to the annual Hazards Conference, 10th July\u000a      2010, Keele University; plenary debate with Professor L&#246;fstedt, Chair of\u000a      the panel appointed by the Prime Minister to review Health and Safety\u000a      legislation (at the IER conference, What Now for Health and Safety At\u000a        Work?

Four key examples\u000a      of this impact are listed here. First, GMB's response to the Coalition\u000a      Government's Review of Health and Safety Legislation The Young Review\u000a      draws extensively on publication 3 listed above. Second, the Trade Union\u000a      Co-ordinating Group, the main parliamentary lobbying group of the trade\u000a      union movement, used publication 3 as the key source for a chapter of the\u000a      briefing paper for its nine constituent unions, Big Society, Savage\u000a        Cuts. Third, the IER has used Dr Whyte's research findings from this\u000a      research as the primary source for its parliamentary lobbying work on\u000a      health and safety rights over the past 3 years. Dr Whyte authored the\u000a      following IER papers as part of this lobbying work: a briefing on The\u000a        Young Review distributed to MPs and senior trade union officials; a\u000a      response to the Law Commission's Consultation Paper Criminal Liability\u000a        in Regulatory Contexts, subsequently published in the New Law\u000a        Journal (`Corporate or criminal?'

The research detailed in this case study was conducted since he\u000a      joined the University of Liverpool. As this case study demonstrates, Dr\u000a      Whyte's research has reached beyond academic audiences to influence\u000a      policy, professional, practitioner and campaigning agendas. Prior to 2007,\u000a      he was a member of the 2005 Scottish Executive Expert Committee on\u000a      Corporate Homicide, an ad hoc panel, commissioned to make recommendations\u000a      to the Scottish Justice Minister. He was a member of the Criminal Law\u000a      Committee of the Law Society of Scotland between 2005-2008 and\u000a      between 2007 and 2013 he has made regular contributions to parliamentary\u000a      inquiries and government consultations via submissions written for NGOs,\u000a      the Centre for Corporate Accountability and the Institute of\u000a        Employment Rights.\u000a    The Causes of the ICL Disaster\u000a    This collaborative research project involved 9 academics from 4 different\u000a      institutions (Universities of Glasgow, Stirling, Liverpool and York) and a\u000a      range of disciplinary backgrounds. The report explored the causes of the\u000a      explosion at the ICL\/Stockline plastics factory in Glasgow, May 2005,\u000a      through the use of hitherto unavailable empirical data and interviews with\u000a      workers at the factory. The work led to a 156 page research report that\u000a      was published by the Universities of Glasgow and Stirling. Dr Whyte's\u000a      research for the report:\u000a    \u000a       identified a range of accountability failures in the regulatory\u000a        system\u000a       identified the gaps in criminal justice process that enabled those\u000a        responsible in cases such as this to remain beyond the scope of the\u000a        courts; and\u000a       proposed a range of measures to deal with this gap in accountability,\u000a        including background sentencing reports and a new system of fines for\u000a        corporations\u000a    \u000a    A Crisis of Enforcement \u000a    The second, related, project was a research grant awarded by the Barry\u000a      Amiel and Norman Melburn Trust for a study of long-term trends in the\u000a      enforcement of workplace health and safety law in the UK. The period of\u000a      the grant ran from January 2008 to June 2008 and was based around the\u000a      construction of a large primary dataset obtained from the Health and\u000a      Safety Executive, and an extensive documentary analysis of published and\u000a      unpublished policy texts. The empirical research conducted during this\u000a      period led to a number of spin-off publications and activities, detailed\u000a      in the following sections of this document. Dr Whyte's research\u000a      demonstrated for the first time:\u000a    \u000a       a seismic qualitative and quantitative change in the regulation of UK\u000a        workplaces.\u000a       how this change resulted directly from the institutionalisation of a\u000a        particular set of political rationalities in government and policy\u000a        networks; and\u000a       identified a set of policy priorities necessary to mitigate the\u000a        impact of this change in the workplace, including recommendations on the\u000a        funding of regulators, and a proposed reassessment of the tripartite\u000a        structure of UK regulation.\u000a    \u000a    This work led to collaborative research with the Centre for Criminal\u000a      Justice Studies (CCJS) and the Institute of Employment Rights (IER).

Electoral\u000a      registration reforms initiated by the Labour government in 2009 came\u000a      within a year of the publication of Dr Wilks-Heeg's initial findings.\u000a      While others, most notably the Electoral Commission, had made the case for\u000a      reforms since 2004, the government had previously been resistant to change\u000a      and, given the timeline summarised above, it is evident that Wilks-Heeg's\u000a      work had a clear, independent impact. Evidence of impact includes: the\u000a      number of MPs who signed an Early Day Motion citing the research; the\u000a      number of references to the research in Parliamentary debates,\u000a      particularly during the passage of the Political Parties and Elections\u000a      Act; and the knowledge of the relevant Minister of State about the\u000a      contents of the report. Similarly, the citation of Dr Wilks-Heeg's\u000a      subsequent work on electoral registration in the media, in parliament, in\u000a      select committee reports and by government ministers are indicators of\u000a      impact, particularly during the passage of the Electoral Registration and\u000a      Administration Bill (now Act) through parliament in 2011-13.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact arises from research on electoral malpractice and electoral\u000a      registration in the UK, carried out by Dr Stuart Wilks-Heeg, and which\u000a      made a clear and identifiable contribution to public and parliamentary\u000a      debate and to policy development.

The outputs from this grant were\u000a      a high-profile report on the completeness and accuracy of the electoral\u000a      registers in Great Britain (Wilks-Heeg et al, 2010) and a literature\u000a      review for the Cabinet Office, published in conjunction with the UK\u000a      government's formal response to pre-legislative scrutiny and the public\u000a      consultation on the draft Electoral Registration Bill (Wilks-Heeg, 2012).\u000a    It is widely recognised that, prior to the publication of Wilks-Heeg's\u000a      (2008, 2009) work on electoral integrity, there had effectively been no\u000a      contemporary academic research on the incidence of electoral fraud in the\u000a      UK. The research demonstrated that:\u000a    \u000a      The actual incidence of electoral fraud was almost certainly greater\u000a        than had previously been recognised;\u000a      Actual convictions for electoral offences were at least double that\u000a        reported in government estimates;\u000a      There were widespread concerns about the vulnerability of UK elections\u000a        to fraud, about the state of UK electoral registers, and about the\u000a        intense pressures on electoral administrators.\u000a    \u000a    Pursuant to this work, Wilks-Heeg et al. (2010) undertook the first major\u000a      study of electoral registration in Britain for five years. This study\u000a      established that:\u000a    \u000a      There had been a long-term decline in the completeness and accuracy of\u000a        the electoral registers nationally, including a potentially dramatic\u000a        decline in registration levels during the 2000s;\u000a      Local case studies, which found individual electoral registers to be\u000a        between 73 and 94 per cent complete, reinforced these conclusions about\u000a        likely under-registration levels;\u000a      Registration levels among young people, members of ethnic minority\u000a        groups and private renters were particularly low and highlighted the\u000a        need for targeted campaigns to improve registration rates.\u000a    \u000a    During the period when the research was carried out, Dr Wilks-Heeg was\u000a      Lecturer, and then Senior Lecturer, in Social Policy at the University of\u000a      Liverpool.

The report\u000d\u000a      to the NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme proposed an\u000d\u000a      evidence-based ethnic\/family origins screening question [3], providing\u000d\u000a      policy-relevant evidence of the validity and reliability of such questions\u000d\u000a      [4]; the practicalities of implementing selective screening in busy\u000d\u000a      practice [3] and the particular lessons for low prevalence areas [5]. It\u000d\u000a      also raised the issue of negative reactions of ethnic majorities to\u000d\u000a      screening results [3]. From 2005 onwards half of NHS Trusts in England\u000d\u000a      (areas designated of low prevalence for sickle cell\/thalassaemia) began to\u000d\u000a      use the Family Origins Questionnaire (FOQ) to identify which women to\u000d\u000a      offer a full laboratory screen for sickle cell\/thalassaemia. From 2009\u000d\u000a      onwards, the remaining NHS Trusts in England (areas designated of high\u000d\u000a      prevalence for sickle cell\/thalassaemia) also began to use the FOQ because\u000d\u000a      (as pointed out in our research) ethnic\/family origins helps laboratories\u000d\u000a      target which laboratory tests to apply, especially in identifying\u000d\u000a      potential cases of severe alpha-thalassaemia.\u000d\u000a    The Family Origins Questionnaire used by the NHS Screening\u000d\u000a      Programme includes several specific features taken directly from our\u000d\u000a      research, including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      An evidence-supported, category-based question was chosen, not an\u000d\u000a        open-ended one [3, 4], nor one based on locally devised, common sense\u000d\u000a        racialised categories [1, 5].\u000d\u000a      The categories used in the question departed from Census categories to\u000d\u000a        amplify those ethnic groups at greater risk of sickle cell\/thalassaemia\u000d\u000a        [2].\u000d\u000a      The fact that an \"ethnic\/family origins\" screening would have utility\u000d\u000a        in high prevalence areas (for assessing those at risk of severe\u000d\u000a        alpha-thalassaemia) as well as in low prevalence areas [4].\u000d\u000a      The screening programme commissioned an \"ethnicity\" screening\u000d\u000a        question, but our research suggested an \"ethnic\/family origins\" question\u000d\u000a        and the policy-makers eventually picked up on and used the phrase\u000d\u000a        \"family origins\". [4]\u000d\u000a      The ethnicity screening question developed encouraged those of \"mixed\"\u000d\u000a        heritage ethnicity to tick any combinations not just the\u000d\u000a        restricted range of mixed options in the 2001 Census[4].\u000d\u000a      The fact that midwives required prompts as to which ethnic categories\u000d\u000a        constituted higher risk groups to whom an offer of a screen should be\u000d\u000a        made [5].\u000d\u000a      The fact that, if a woman ticked certain boxes, instructions for the\u000d\u000a        midwife on what to do in terms of bottling, labelling and sending off\u000d\u000a        blood for testing were required [5].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The reach of the impact is possible to quantify. All pregnant\u000d\u000a      women in England (approximately 3 million between January 2008-July 2013)\u000d\u000a      will have been administered the family origins questionnaire (the\u000d\u000a      development of our ethnic\/family origins screening question). Although the\u000d\u000a      screening question was initially (2005-2009) used in only 50% of England\u000d\u000a      (low prevalence areas) to identify pregnant women at higher risk of\u000d\u000a      carrying genes associated with sickle cell\/thalassaemia for the purposes\u000d\u000a      of targeting an offer to screen in the laboratory for sickle cell, from\u000d\u000a      2009 onwards the questionnaire was also used in the rest of England\u000d\u000a      designated as high prevalence areas (where all women are offered a\u000d\u000a      laboratory test to screen for sickle cell\/thalassaemia). This is because,\u000d\u000a      as part of the research programme recommendations, it was pointed out by\u000d\u000a      us that all screening laboratories made use of the ethnicity information\u000d\u000a      to further target laboratory tests. For example, there are thousands of\u000d\u000a      different types of mutations underlying thalassaemia, and if the\u000d\u000a      laboratory knows a woman's ancestral origins they can more quickly and\u000d\u000a      efficiently confirm thalassaemia by targeting their laboratory\u000d\u000a      investigations to those genetic variations found more commonly in the\u000d\u000a      woman's particular ethnic group. The programme therefore followed our\u000d\u000a      specific recommendation that the same screening question would be\u000d\u000a      appropriate in both low prevalence areas (for targeting whom to offer an\u000d\u000a      initial laboratory screen) and in high prevalence areas (for targeting\u000d\u000a      further laboratory tests).\u000d\u000a    The Family Origins Questionnaire as an ethnicity screening tool was part\u000d\u000a      of the 2008 National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines\u000d\u000a      for antenatal care of women. These NICE guidelines cite the quality of the\u000d\u000a      evidence provided by our reference 4 as Evidence Level 1+, the top level\u000d\u000a      of evidence. The NICE guidelines summarize the evidence underpinning\u000d\u000a      policy deriving from our research as \"A fixed response question for\u000d\u000a      screening for family origins is supported by findings from an RCT as being\u000d\u000a      a useful screening test\". (NICE, 2008: 132) and cite their Guideline\u000d\u000a      Development Group interpretation of this evidence as \"Screening for family\u000d\u000a      origins using a fixed response tick box question is effective in\u000d\u000a      identifying pregnant mothers at risk of haemoglobinopathy (i.e. sickle\u000d\u000a      cell\/thalassaemia).

(NICE, 2008: 132)\u000d\u000a    In summary, since 2009 all pregnant women in England (approximately\u000d\u000a      670,000 a year) are offered the Family Origins Questionnaire at their\u000d\u000a      first antenatal appointment with their midwife as part of NHS Screening\u000d\u000a      Programme policy.

The large empirical\u000d\u000a      study (of 5,211 pregnant women across London, Birmingham, Leicestershire\u000d\u000a      and Devon in collaboration with 4 consultant haematologists, 4 laboratory\u000d\u000a      officers, 298 community midwives, 7 sickle cell nurse counsellors and 6\u000d\u000a      research nurses), investigated the validity, reliability, practicalities\u000d\u000a      and displacement effects of attempting to target antenatal screening for\u000d\u000a      people at risk of carrying genes associated with sickle cell\/ thalassaemia\u000d\u000a      by means of an ethnic\/family origins question.\u000d\u000a    A randomized controlled trial of two candidate ethnicity screening\u000d\u000a      questions found that a category-based ethnicity screening question\u000d\u000a      performed better than a binary plus open-ended question. The\u000d\u000a      category-based question was more reliable (i.e. produced the same reply to\u000d\u000a      the ethnic\/family origins screening question when asked a second time,\u000d\u000a      several weeks later by a different health professional) and took slightly\u000d\u000a      less time to administer. This provided policy-makers with a measure of the\u000d\u000a      degree of association between social constructs of ethnicity and actual\u000d\u000a      genetic status. The conclusion was that the category-based question was\u000d\u000a      recommended as the basis for the screening question to be adopted by the\u000d\u000a      NHS Screening Programme [4].\u000d\u000a    The second part of the funded project &#8212; qualitative research with mothers\u000d\u000a      and midwives &#8212; revealed problems on the ground with targeted screening.\u000d\u000a      Some midwives used intuition to select\/exclude clients from the screening\u000d\u000a      questions rather than implement formal policy. The persistence of\u000d\u000a      erroneous beliefs in 'racial' groups displaced correct understandings of\u000d\u000a      the relation between ethnicity and risk of carrying genes associated with\u000d\u000a      sickle cell\/thalassaemia. We recommended that continuing professional\u000d\u000a      education of midwives responsible for screening should include education\u000d\u000a      around the concepts of ethnicity and the problems for sickle cell\u000d\u000a      screening that arise if one thinks in terms of false notions of distinct\u000d\u000a      racial categories [3].\u000d\u000a    In the low prevalence area of our study, use of our evidence-based\u000d\u000a      ethnicity screening question (as opposed to locally devised \"common sense\"\u000d\u000a      categories previously in use) increased the proportion of clients\u000d\u000a      correctly identified as at risk of carrying genes associated with sickle\u000d\u000a      cell or thalassaemia from 2.2% to 13.0%. Use of our screening question\u000d\u000a      means that guidance can now be given to the 10.8% of women who were\u000d\u000a      previously being denied his advice. Our research also found that, even\u000d\u000a      where midwives were correctly identifying mothers as at-risk by the\u000d\u000a      ethnicity- screening questions, only ten per cent of mothers were actually\u000d\u000a      being offered a laboratory screen. In order to minimise the rates of\u000d\u000a      failing to offer laboratory screening, it was pointed out that midwives\u000d\u000a      require specific instructions on the screening question as to which risk\u000d\u000a      groups to offer a laboratory screen [6], and this was a feature of the\u000d\u000a      screening question adopted by the NHS Screening Programme and used in\u000d\u000a      practice from 2005 to date.\u000d\u000a    A major output of the research was the proposal of an ethnic\/family\u000d\u000a      origins screening questionnaire for use by the NHS Screening Programme\u000d\u000a      [Appendix of reference 3]. With modifications made by the NHS Screening\u000d\u000a      Programme itself, our screening question became adopted by the programme\u000d\u000a      as the Family Origins Questionnaire (FOQ). The screening programme\u000d\u000a      gradually brought all NHS Trusts into line with national screening\u000d\u000a      policies between 2005-8 until all NHS Trusts in England were implementing\u000d\u000a      screening using the FOQ by 2008.The National Institute for Clinical\u000d\u000a      Excellence (NICE, 2008) drew upon our research in producing evidence-based\u000d\u000a      guidelines for the implementation of antenatal screening in England.\u000d\u000a    Notes on non-DMU Contributors: David Rees (Consultant in\u000d\u000a      Haematology, Kings College Hospital); Cynthia Gill (Sickle cell nurse\u000d\u000a      counsellor, freelance consultant); Ann Kennefick (Research Nurse,\u000d\u000a      Birmingham); Patsy Morris (Research Midwife, Kings College); Faye Sutton\u000d\u000a      (Research Midwife, Exeter and Devon); Patricia Squire (Research Midwife,\u000d\u000a      University Hospitals of Leicester); Keith Chambers (Senior Medical\u000d\u000a      Scientific Laboratory Officer, University Hospitals of Leicester); Sue\u000d\u000a      Gawler (Senior Medical Scientific Laboratory Officer, Exeter and Devon NHS\u000d\u000a      Trust); Vanita Jivanji (Sickle Cell Nurse Counsellor, Leicester City PCT).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8330","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"617790","Name":"Moldova"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a      The Social Action approach has had consequences and has made a distinct\u000a        contribution outside the academic community.

A testimonial provided by Youth Deamers (which\u000a          can be made available upon request) states: \"Since starting the Youth\u000a          Dreamers in 2001, 618 students have been served in our programs, 251\u000a          students have been employed to teach in our programs, 17,194\u000a          service-learning hours towards graduation have been earned by students\u000a          attending our programs, 15 programs have been designed and implemented\u000a          by youth, 23 community art projects have been completed, and 520\u000a          volunteers have participated in service days.

The methodological exploration of social action as a\u000a        participatory approach began in the 1980s [e], and its use and\u000a        development has continued ever since. The underpinning research and\u000a        innovative theoretical approach has been developed and refined by a\u000a        large number of researchers across many projects and publications [see\u000a        e.g. a], produced both for academic and non-academic audiences.\u000a      Social Action is a combination of six principles and a clear process,\u000a        and Social Action Research is a distinct methodology within\u000a        participative approaches and has the following key elements, as defined\u000a        in the seminal work by Fleming and Ward in 2004:\u000a      \u000a        Participatory &#8212; facilitates the full involvement of research\u000a          subjects and other stakeholders in all stages of the research.\u000a        Inductive &#8212; draws theory out of data rather than interprets data and\u000a          organises data within predefined or given frameworks.\u000a        Critical &#8212; grounded on a power perspective, committed to social\u000a          change to the advantage of those currently without power.\u000a        Anti-oppressive &#8212; actively challenges assumptions which underpin\u000a          unequal social relations, with an explicit commitment to empowerment\u000a          and social justice.\u000a        Iterative &#8212; builds up theory and knowledge progressively.\u000a        Cyclical &#8212; a process that continually revisits and evaluates its\u000a          building blocks (Fleming and Ward 2004).\u000a      \u000a      The research underpinning this case study has involved a number of DMU\u000a        staff, primarily Prof D Ward (Professor of Social and Community Studies,\u000a        DMU 1994 - ), J Fleming (Director, CSA, Reader in Participatory Research\u000a        and Social Action, DMU 1995 - ), Dr T Boeck (Senior Research Fellow, DMU\u000a        1998 - ), Dr H Weich (Senior Lecturer, DMU 2001 - ) and Prof R. Smith\u000a        (Professor of Social Work Research 2006-2012).\u000a      The methodological approach and insights into the use of social action\u000a        and participatory methods for both practice and research were developed\u000a        through application in a variety of research projects locally,\u000a        nationally and internationally [e.g. c, d]. All of these projects were\u000a        gained through competitive tender or peer reviewed application. All the\u000a        projects gained through competitive tender were commissioned with the\u000a        specific view of influencing policy in the commissioning organisation or\u000a        more widely and thus often led to immediate and tangible impacts. Since\u000a        1993 the social action methodological approach has been used directly or\u000a        to inform the methodology of many high quality research projects funded\u000a        by (for example) the European Union (TESR), DfID, Community Fund, Big\u000a        Lottery, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Dept of Health, local\u000a        authorities (e.g. the City Councils of Leicester and Nottingham,\u000a        Bedfordshire County Council), national bodies (e.g. Id&amp;ea, SCIE),\u000a        voluntary organisations (e.g. Howard League, Volunteering England,\u000a        Participation Works).

Direct impacts\u000a      have been secured through publication and dissemination of research\u000a      reports, articles and blogs in which Finn has translated his comparative\u000a      knowledge and expertise into findings directly relevant to policy design\u000a      and implementation. The impact has been further secured through a\u000a      sustained programme of public engagement including formal presentations to\u000a      and dialogue with senior policy makers, practitioners, advocacy\u000a      organisations and user groups. This activity has been facilitated by the\u000a      University of Portsmouth and often undertaken in collaboration with the\u000a      independent and non-profit Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (Inclusion).\u000a    Two of the research studies were specifically commissioned to inform UK\u000a      policy development. The 2007 DWP study on `Contracting Out Welfare to Work\u000a      in the USA' informed and was published alongside the consultative draft of\u000a      the Department's `Commissioning Strategy', finalised in 2008. The 2011 DWP\u000a      study of `Job Services Australia' was commissioned to inform the design of\u000a      the Work Programme, with Professor Finn delivering presentations on\u000a      emerging findings to the civil service teams responsible for designing the\u000a      programme. Not all recommendations were acted on but the report findings\u000a      ensured policy makers fully considered the implications for service user\u000a      safeguards including the subsequent decision to require Work Programme\u000a      prime contractors to put minimum service standards in place. Professor\u000a      Finn is currently also a member of a consortium of research organisations\u000a      commissioned to evaluate the Work Programme for DWP and is responsible for\u000a      ensuring the evaluation is informed by the latest comparative research\u000a      evidence.\u000a    Several of the research studies enhanced public scrutiny. The 2008\u000a      JRF-sponsored report on `Lessons from contracting out welfare to work\u000a      programmes in Australia and the Netherlands' focused on the experiences of\u000a      and safeguards for service users. The 2012 NAO report on `The design of\u000a      the Work Programme in international context' informed their first scrutiny\u000a      report on the new programme, was published alongside it, and was then\u000a      drawn on in the lines of questioning pursued by the Public Accounts\u000a      Committee (to which Professor Finn gave oral evidence). Professor Finn was\u000a      also a Special Adviser to two inquiries undertaken by the House of Commons\u000a      Work and Pensions Committee into `DWP's Commissioning Strategy' (2009) and\u000a      the `Management and administration of contracted employment programmes'\u000a      (2010). His advice to the Committee on the terms of reference of each\u000a      inquiry and detailed guidance on the lines of questioning pursued and\u000a      recommendations made drew directly on his UK and comparative research\u000a      findings, as did his subsequent oral evidence to the Committee's 2012\u000a      inquiry into the `Introduction of the Work Programme'.\u000a    Professor Finn's collaboration with Inclusion (www.cesi.org.uk)\u000a      facilitated the impact of his research output and allowed the quick\u000a      dissemination of findings through their networking activities and\u000a      extensive internet based services. Professor Finn has given presentations\u000a      on his research at each of Inclusion's annual `Welfare to Work\u000a      Conventions' between 2005 and 2012 and in the run up to DWP's\u000a      Commissioning Strategy he led discussions on user safeguards and services\u000a      at four Inclusion brokered confidential `Chatham House' workshops\u000a      with officials and senior managers of employment service providers.\u000a    Professor Finn has presented his research output and made recommendations\u000a      to successive British Work and Pensions Ministers and Shadow Ministers\u000a      with mixed results, albeit several findings directly influenced subsequent\u000a      policy, as around service user safeguards. He has in particular improved\u000a      knowledge of the design and findings from comparative contracting systems\u000a      through the delivery of presentations at many conferences and seminars\u000a      attended by senior policy makers and practitioners in both the UK and in\u000a      other countries. This has included key-note presentations to Ministers,\u000a      policy makers and the national conferences of employment services\u000a      providers in Australia, the Netherlands and the USA.\u000a    From 2009 the geographical remit of the impact of his research has\u000a      extended further, as evidenced through presentations on `making markets in\u000a      welfare programmes' to senior policy makers in Ireland and Sweden and to\u000a      Ministers and officials from a wide range of `middle income' developing\u000a      countries at events organised by the World Bank and the Inter-American\u000a      Development Bank (including for example, Ministers from Turkey, Slovakia,\u000a      and Mexico). He has also produced two `analytical reports' for the\u000a      European Commission's `Mutual Learning Programme for Public Employment\u000a      Services' that further developed the comparative evidence base on\u000a      contracting practices.

These investigated the rationale, design, implementation and impacts\u000a      of contracted out welfare to work programmes in the countries at the\u000a      forefront of such reforms - Australia, the Netherlands, the USA and the\u000a      UK.\u000a    The individual research projects were undertaken solely by Professor Finn\u000a      whilst employed at the University of Portsmouth. They each comprised\u000a      reviews of documentary evidence, findings from formal evaluations,\u000a      investigations by scrutiny bodies and other `grey' literature, and were\u000a      completed within 12 to 26 weeks from commencement. Cumulatively they\u000a      included two two-week case study visits each in Australia (2008, 2011),\u000a      the Netherlands (2008, 2009) and in the USA (2007, 2010). Each study visit\u000a      involved qualitative fieldwork comprising extensive site visits and\u000a      interviews with stakeholders, advocacy organisations, service providers,\u000a      and researchers. The studies resulted in the collection and analysis of a\u000a      unique body of research materials supplemented by interviews with and\u000a      unpublished documentation provided by high-level policy makers and peer\u000a      researchers.\u000a    The research findings have been published in eight public reports, two\u000a      peer reviewed journal articles and two book chapters. In addition to peer\u000a      reviewed articles the research reports were each subject to quality\u000a      assurance processes that involved detailed review by expert readers and\u000a      policy analysts. In the case of the grant awarded by the Joseph Rowntree\u000a      Foundation (JRF) this included pre-publication review by three leading\u000a      social policy academics, including Professor Julian Le Grand, the primary\u000a      social policy expert on quasi-market analysis. Findings from Finn's\u000a      studies are now frequently cited in the growing academic literature on\u000a      welfare to work quasi-markets.\u000a    The studies identified and critically evaluated emergent policy and\u000a      design `lessons' from the experience of successive tendering rounds in the\u000a      different countries and their implications for the design, regulation and\u000a      efficiency of the British system. Each research project had particular\u000a      objectives but shared key themes central to the design of payment by\u000a      results contracting systems and the concerns of policy makers, providers\u000a      and service users. The studies critically assessed how policy makers and\u000a      programme designers sought to minimise the risks of `creaming', `parking',\u000a      `gaming' and `fraud', commonly associated with such systems. The findings\u000a      showed how the development and management of welfare quasi markets\u000a      comprised novel, complex and demanding tasks for managers and\u000a      administrators, and gave insights into how best to prepare them for such\u000a      challenges. The studies gave detailed information also on the varied ways\u000a      in which policy makers may steer their systems and capture the\u000a      efficiencies and innovation offered by independent contractors, including\u000a      the safeguards needed to ensure third sector providers are not displaced\u000a      by larger for-profit companies.\u000a    The research findings assessed and gave policy makers and user groups\u000a      insights into how different contracting models shaped the experience of\u000a      participants and employers, including the types of services offered by\u000a      providers, the placement strategies they adopted, how service users were\u000a      treated, and how benefit sanctions were designed and implemented. Despite\u000a      early reluctance they helped persuade UK policy makers of the importance\u000a      of contracting agencies independently monitoring participant experience\u000a      and ensuring robust systems to respond to complaints of unfair treatment\u000a      and poor service delivery.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11749","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This body of work has had substantial impact, influencing policy and\u000d\u000a      practice in the areas of age discrimination, design and end-of-life care.\u000d\u000a    Impact on policy\u000d\u000a    (i) The RoAD research was influential in the joint response given by Help\u000d\u000a      the Aged\/Age Concern, (now Age UK), first to the National Equality Panel,\u000d\u000a      part of the UK Discrimination Law Review (2007\/08), and second in evidence\u000d\u000a      submitted to the UK Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights\u000d\u000a      (2008\/09).

During the process of bringing forward the Equalities Bill (2008),\u000d\u000a      now the Equalities Act (2010), Harriet Harman MP (then Secretary of State\u000d\u000a      for Equalities) referred to the campaign as `evidence that has made it\u000d\u000a      imperative for us to act' [5.1 - 5.4].\u000d\u000a    (ii) In October 2008, JRF gave documentary evidence to a House of Commons\u000d\u000a      Select Committee entitled The Provision of Public Toilets.

As a result of the JRF\u000d\u000a      evidence, the subsequent parliamentary report recommended that `local\u000d\u000a      authorities can and should exercise existing legislative powers to prevent\u000d\u000a      anti-social behaviour', and that `local authorities study the benefits and\u000d\u000a      cost effectiveness of providing attended public toilets, or at least\u000d\u000a      ensuring regular inspections, so that the public regains its confidence in\u000d\u000a      using them' [5.5].\u000d\u000a    Impact on practice\u000d\u000a    (iii) When central government funding became available for the\u000d\u000a      development of extra-care housing in England, local decision makers in the\u000d\u000a      Jewish community were presented with the question of how to address\u000d\u000a      cultural and age-friendly issues. While participants wished to live in\u000d\u000a      locations close to Jewish facilities such as the synagogue, the direct\u000d\u000a      influence of Katz and Holland's research can be seen in the design of a\u000d\u000a      care facility by Jewish Care, which provides enhanced space standards,\u000d\u000a      even within two bedroom units, making a highly positive impact upon the\u000d\u000a      lives of older people and establishing a model for future design [5.6].\u000d\u000a    (iv) The capacity to influence both the setting and the design of living\u000d\u000a      environments for older people is clearly evident in the ongoing outcomes\u000d\u000a      of the `Transitions in Kitchen Living (TiKL)' study.

Help\u000d\u000a      the Aged (now Age UK) initiated this collaborative project with the OU in\u000d\u000a      2003 to engage older people in participatory research, including online\u000d\u000a      networking, diary keeping and &#8212; significantly &#8212; training older\u000d\u000a      co-researchers to interview others about daily experiences of ageism. The\u000d\u000a      UK-wide findings identified discrimination in public places, health\u000d\u000a      service delivery, the marketplace, appearance and fashion, sexuality and\u000d\u000a      sexual orientation [3.1,5.1-5.4].\u000d\u000a    Three of the projects dealt with particular concerns of ageing and the\u000d\u000a      environment namely planning, housing and design. `Social interaction in\u000d\u000a      urban public places' (2005-07) funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation\u000d\u000a      (JRF) was led by Peace who was Principal Investigator (PI) with Holland,\u000d\u000a      Katz (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer) and Clark (Research Assistant). The\u000d\u000a      geographical focus was the town of Aylesbury, Bucks, where trained\u000d\u000a      co-researchers spent a year observing how different generations shared,\u000d\u000a      contested and avoided public spaces. These observations led to\u000d\u000a      recommendations that facilitate age-friendly communities through using\u000d\u000a      public resources to create accessible public toilets and appropriate\u000d\u000a      street furniture [3.2,5.5]. Ageing or `staying' in place was also central\u000d\u000a      to the second study, `Attitudes of Jewish people regarding extra-care\u000d\u000a      housing' (2005-06) led by Katz (PI) and Holland [3.3,5.6]. This used focus\u000d\u000a      group discussions on the topics of accommodation and care, the need for\u000d\u000a      support and the importance of personal space within the physical\u000d\u000a      environment. Building on this work, Holland and Peace acted as consultants\u000d\u000a      for Silverville, a television programme by the BBC about daily\u000d\u000a      life in extra-care housing.\u000d\u000a    The third project, `Transitions in kitchen living' formed part of the UK\u000d\u000a      Research Councils' New Dynamics of Ageing programme, and considered the\u000d\u000a      effect of contemporary kitchen design upon older people living in both\u000d\u000a      supportive and normal domestic housing, alongside related experiences of\u000d\u000a      kitchens from the past and the possible role of future assistive\u000d\u000a      technology (2009-12). For this work, Peace (PI), Percival (Research\u000d\u000a      Assistant) and Scicluna (PhD student) collaborated with colleagues at\u000d\u000a      Loughborough University's Design School. Their findings show how personal\u000d\u000a      mobility, reach, dexterity, vision and hearing are all impacted upon by\u000d\u000a      poor design, and how kitchens can be made to enhance personal well-being\u000d\u000a      [5.7].\u000d\u000a    Finally, three connected projects, all funded by the Department of\u000d\u000a      Health, were concerned with end-of-life care: `Death and dying in\u000d\u000a      residential homes for older people', 'Investigating the training of staff'\u000d\u000a      and `Developing training materials' (1995-2002). These featured Katz (PI),\u000d\u000a      Sidell (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer to 2003) and Komaromy (Research\u000d\u000a      Assistant, Lecturer, Senior Lecturer) [3.4,3.5,5.7-9]. Involving a phased\u000d\u000a      national study of one hundred care homes, the research demonstrated how\u000d\u000a      care staff need to recognise and put into practice end-of-life care for\u000d\u000a      frail older people, acknowledging the importance of their personal needs\u000d\u000a      and wider relationships. The findings have since formed the basis of\u000d\u000a      important training materials.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11810","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    (a) Changing health service commissioning:\u000a    Durham research had a significant impact on the decisions of the PCT in\u000a      designing, commissioning, managing, adapting  &#8212;  and ultimately\u000a      de-commissioning  &#8212;  a County Durham wide case management service for IB\u000a      patients [source 10]. In response to our initial research findings (about\u000a      recruitment and referrals), the PCT `adapted the service specification'\u000a      so that a financial incentive could be given to GPs to increase patient\u000a      referrals. Our interim findings (around mental health) `underpinned our\u000a        [PCT] subsequent decision to change the service specification' so\u000a      that the commissioned service would have to prioritise those with mental\u000a      health conditions in their recruitment and thereby `increase patient\u000a        uptake and the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the service'\u000a      [source 10]. Our final research findings (about limited effectiveness\u000a      [research 1 and 2]) `were critical to our [PCT] decision not to\u000a        re-commission or roll-out the service at the end of the contract in\u000a        2012' [source 10]. This service affected 400 individual benefit\u000a      recipients across County Durham. The PCT had intended to roll the service\u000a      out to 2000 additional benefit recipients if it had been shown to be more\u000a      effective\u000a    (b) Influencing NHS funding policy by generating Parliamentary debate:\u000a      Durham's research [research 4] into the Secretary of State for Health's\u000a      suggestion that the role of age in NHS funding allocations should be\u000a      increased and the role of deprivation decreased (`age-based'\u000a      allocation)[source 1], provoked a national political debate about the\u000a      allocation of NHS resources in May 2012. There was widespread regional and\u000a      national media dissemination of our research including interviews with ITV\u000a      and BBC 1 regional news, national BBC Radio Five Live, significant Twitter\u000a      traffic (including tweets by Members of Parliament [MPs]) as well as\u000a      detailed coverage in the Guardian [source 2] and Independent\u000a      newspapers [source 3]. The newspaper reports included comments from the\u000a      Shadow Secretary of State for Health (Andy Burnham) and the Department of\u000a      Health on Durham's research [research 4]. Our research was also press\u000a      released by Labour Party Shadow Health team [source 11]. This prompted a\u000a      series of questions in the House of Commons by the Labour MPs Paul\u000a      Blomfield, Nicholas Brown, and Chi Onwurah to the Conservative Secretary\u000a      of State for Health (Andrew Lansley) and Minister of State for Health\u000a      (Simon Burns) in `Health Questions' [source 4]. The subsequent formula\u000a      devised by ACRA (which would have removed the health inequalities element\u000a      in NHS funding) was rejected in December 2012 by the NHS Commissioning\u000a      Board and a new (and on-going as of November 2013) `fundamental' review of\u000a      the allocation formula commissioned instead [source 5]. Media reports by\u000a      the Health Service Journal [source 5] suggested this decision may\u000a      have been as a result of political concerns  &#8212;  to which our research\u000a      contributed [source 4]  &#8212;  about the resulting geographical funding shifts.\u000a      The Chair of the NHS Commissioning Board stated the decision was from\u000a      concern for preventing the movement of \"resources from areas where\u000a        people sadly have worse health outcomes to those where people have much\u000a        better outcomes\" [source 5]  &#8212;  as demonstrated by our research\u000a      [research 4].\u000a    (c) Contributing to the development of the new public health system in\u000a        England (as part of the Marmot Review): The coalition\u000a      Government's 2011 White Paper Healthy Lives, Healthy People set\u000a      out a new public health system for England which included the transfer of\u000a      public health responsibilities from the NHS to local authorities, the\u000a      establishment of Health and Wellbeing Boards and the creation of a new\u000a      organisation  &#8212;  Public Health England [source 6]. In 2012, the government\u000a      created the 2013-16 Public Health Outcomes Framework  &#8212;  a set of\u000a      indicators to monitor the new system [source 7]. The White Paper [source\u000a      6] and the Outcomes Framework [source 7] were both based on the Department\u000a      of Health commissioned Marmot Review [source 8]. For example, the\u000a      White Paper states that: \"This White Paper is the Government's\u000a        response to Fair Society, Healthy Lives  &#8212;  the Marmot Review\" [source\u000a      6, p.32)] and the Public Health Outcomes Framework document states that: \"These\u000a        indicators are in line with those recommended by Sir Michael Marmot in\u000a        his report Fair Society, Healthy Lives in 2010\" [source 7, p.12].\u000a      The Marmot Review therefore had a significant impact on the\u000a      development of national public health policy and was itself based on nine\u000a      commissioned research reviews. The task group section of the Marmot\u000a        Review website clearly states the importance of the task groups'\u000a      work [source 9]: \"In February 2010, we published the Marmot Review  &#8212; \u000a        'Fair Society Healthy Lives. This was based, in large part, on\u000a        commissioned task group reports in several key areas\". Durham led\u000a      the research and Delphi review for one of these Task Groups  &#8212;  Task Group Priority\u000a        Public Health Conditions [research 5 and 6]. Five of the fifteen\u000a      evidence based policy recommendations resulting from this Durham-led work\u000a      were used in the final Marmot Review underpinning four of the\u000a      report's twenty recommendations and our underpinning research [research 5\u000a      and 6] was cited extensively in support (source 8, pages 45, 54, 57, 59,\u000a      141, 143-46, 157). Our recommendation 10 `increase use of contingency\u000a      management within drug treatment programs' became the Marmot Review's\u000a      Policy Recommendation F2.2(i) [source 8, page 143]. Our recommendation 1\u000a      `reduce smoking in the most hard to reach groups by focusing on price and\u000a      availability, while providing stop smoking services to help the poorest\u000a      groups quit' and recommendation 4 `introduce of a minimum price per unit\u000a      for alcohol' became the Marmot Review's Policy Recommendation F2.2(ii)\u000a      [source 8; page 144-145]. Our recommendation 2 `improve availability of\u000a      and access to healthier food choices amongst low income groups' became the\u000a      Marmot Review's Policy Recommendation F2.2(iii) [source 8; page 145-146].\u000a      Our recommendation number 15  &#8212;  `implement a minimum income for healthy\u000a      living in older people' became the Marmot Review's Policy Recommendation\u000a      D2.1 [source 8, page 120]. Durham-led research [research 5 and 6] is\u000a      therefore a key part of the evidence base that underpinned the Marmot\u000a        Review [source 8], which itself was cited as the underpinning\u000a      evidence behind national-wide (England) policy changes as outlined in the\u000a      2011 White Paper Healthy Lives, Healthy People [source 6] and the\u000a      Public Health Outcomes Framework [source 7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Health inequalities are recognised as a critical UK policy issue with\u000a      life expectancy gaps of up to 28 years between the least and most deprived\u000a      areas.

There are 40,000\u000a      incapacity-related benefit (IB) recipients in County Durham (12% of the\u000a      working age population). We supported the development, design,\u000a      commissioning and evaluation of this `health first' case management\u000a      service for patients in receipt of incapacity benefit (IB) in County\u000a      Durham [research 1 and 2]. The service used telephone and face-to-face\u000a      techniques with the intention of improving health outcomes directly (via\u000a      specially commissioned physiotherapy and counselling services) and\u000a      indirectly (via addressing related barriers to health improvement such as\u000a      debt or housing). We evaluated it using traditional quantitative analysis\u000a      of the health and wellbeing of participants compared to similar\u000a      non-participants [research 1], as well as qualitative comparative analysis\u000a      techniques (QCA) [research 2], and qualitative interviews and focus groups\u000a      with participants, service providers and health professionals. Our early\u000a      research findings in 2010 showed that the service was under-recruiting and\u000a      that referrals were largely from specialist services and not from general\u000a      practice (GPs). This meant that patients had higher levels of ill health\u000a      and more complex needs than the general IB population. Our interim\u000a      findings of 2011 found that the service was more effective for patients\u000a      with a mental health diagnosis. Our final research findings of 2012 found\u000a      that the service was moderately effective and potentially cost-effective\u000a      but that the health of participants remained well below the national\u000a      average; that the vast majority of participants remained workless; and\u000a      that there were on-going difficulties in recruitment from GPs and\u000a      therefore the service was not reaching the general IB population [research\u000a      1 and 2].\u000a    (b) Healthcare and health inequalities: Durham analysis (with\u000a      European collaborators) of the effects of international healthcare reforms\u000a      demonstrated that decentralisation, changes to how funding is allocated to\u000a      local areas, insurance-based systems and out-of-pocket payments increased\u000a      socio-economic inequalities in healthcare access with nationalised,\u000a      publicly funded health systems the most effective at reducing inequalities\u000a      [research 3]. Building on this work, in 2012, Durham examined the effects\u000a      on geographical health inequalities of potential changes to how NHS\u000a      funding would be allocated to local areas. This was in response to media\u000a      reports that the Secretary of State for Health was going to ask the\u000a      Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) to re-examine the\u000a      underlying principles of NHS funding to take more account of age and less\u000a      of deprivation. The Secretary of State had suggested that `\"What\u000a        should happen  &#8212;  the advisory committee will do this, I won't &#8212; the\u000a        number crunching should get progressively to a greater focus on what are\u000a        the actual determinants of health need\"' and that `clinical\u000a        commissioning group funding should take into account the age of a\u000a        population rather than indices of deprivation, ... [as] age is the\u000a        \"principal determinant of health need\" in an area' [Source 1]. We\u000a      analysed the potential effects of such an `age-based' allocation model of\u000a      NHS funding and found that increasing the weighting given to age and\u000a      decreasing the weighting given to deprivation-related and health\u000a      inequalities factors, could shift funds significantly both spatially (from\u000a      North to South) and socio-economically (from poorer to richer areas)\u000a      [research 4].\u000a    (c) Tackling the social determinants of health: In November 2008,\u000a      the Secretary of State for Health (England) commissioned an independent\u000a      review to propose effective strategies for reducing health inequalities  &#8212; \u000a      the Marmot Review. Nine task groups were asked to conduct research\u000a      reviews and make evidence-based recommendations to the Marmot Review\u000a      based on the best available evidence across a number of social policy\u000a      domains. We were commissioned (alongside Liverpool John Moores University\u000a      and Kings College London) to conduct the research synthesis of the\u000a      effectiveness of interventions to reduce inequalities in `Priority Public\u000a      Health Conditions' (cancer, obesity, smoking, and alcohol use) [research 5\u000a      and 6]. Using rapid review methods and a Delphi process, we undertook a\u000a      series of rapid literature reviews of the policy-relevant international\u000a      evidence base in which quantitative studies of any design, which looked at\u000a      the effects on health inequalities, the social gradient or overall\u000a      population health effects, of interventions designed to address the social\u000a      determinants of public health priority conditions. Recommendations were\u000a      distilled using a Delphi approach. This Durham-led research concluded that\u000a      there was a dearth of robust evidence on the effectiveness and\u000a      cost-effectiveness of the effects of interventions on inequalities and\u000a      that therefore our fifteen policy recommendations to the Marmot Review\u000a      were by necessity based on extrapolation from general population health\u000a      effects  &#8212;  the best available evidence [research 5 and 6].\u000a    This Durham-based research programme was led by Clare Bambra (Lecturer\u000a      2005, Reader 2009, Professor 2010+) with J.

It has shaped the development of services\u000d\u000a      in the statutory, voluntary and private sector throughout the UK over the\u000d\u000a      REF period and has changed the way in which professionals work with\u000d\u000a      children, young people and their families, as follows:\u000d\u000a    Impact on policy, guidance and service development\u000d\u000a      Evidence from the research studies A and B (refs. 4 and 6) on the\u000d\u000a      importance of holistic, interagency approaches underpinned the publication\u000d\u000a      of the interdepartmental government document (2006) The needs and\u000d\u000a        effective treatment of young people who sexually abuse: current\u000d\u000a        evidence. Here the research was cited 19 times with the research\u000d\u000a      directly shaping government policy on: improving responses to young people\u000d\u000a      with learning disabilities who sexually offend; improving collaboration\u000d\u000a      between criminal justice and child protection agencies in cases of sexual\u000d\u000a      abuse by young people; improving services for parents; recommended types\u000d\u000a      of therapy; and, the development of a tiered service delivery model. This\u000d\u000a      in turn led to Hackett's appointment by the Department of Health as one of\u000d\u000a      three experts to develop a proposed national strategy on young people who\u000d\u000a      sexually abuse in the DH document (2009) Young people who display\u000d\u000a        sexually harmful behaviour. A Framework for Service Development.\u000d\u000a    Findings on the need for more integrated practice between criminal\u000d\u000a      justice and child protection agencies (projects B and C, refs. 3 and 6)\u000d\u000a      were also used in the development and evaluation of the AIM Assessment\u000d\u000a      Framework (2004) and AIM2 (2007) adopted by many Local Safeguarding\u000d\u000a      Children Boards throughout England and Wales (from 2008). Findings on\u000d\u000a      integrated practice were also incorporated into the recommendations of key\u000d\u000a      policy documents such as the joint thematic inspection report (2013) Examining\u000a        Multi-Agency Responses to Children and Young People who sexually offend\u000d\u000a      conducted by HMI Probation, Care Quality Commission, HMI Constabulary, HMI\u000d\u000a      Prisons and Ofsted (source 5). The findings on the state of policy and\u000d\u000a      practice with young sexual abusers and the need for integrated child\u000d\u000a      protection and criminal justice practices (projects A and B, refs. 5 and\u000d\u000a      6) have led to the development of a coordinated programme of NSPCC\u000d\u000a      services, policy and strategy with regard to sexual abuse including (2009)\u000d\u000a      Sexual Abuse and Therapeutic Services for Young People: The gap between\u000d\u000a        provision and need and (2012) Therapeutic Services for Sexually\u000d\u000a        Abused Children and Young People: Scoping the Evidence Base (sources\u000d\u000a      1 and 7) and underpin the NSPCC's current national practice manual for\u000d\u000a      young people with harmful sexual behaviours, the `Change for Good'\u000d\u000a      programme (source 1).\u000d\u000a    The findings on policy problems, and a lack of progress in implementing\u000d\u000a      the proposed national strategy (above) in the context of governmental\u000d\u000a      change and public service cuts, started a wider public discussion through\u000d\u000a      high profile dissemination of findings through the media: in May 2010,\u000d\u000a      Hackett appeared on Newsnight, BBC 6 O'Clock and 9 O'Clock News and Radio\u000d\u000a      4 `File On Four'. BBC reports (source 9) directly quoted Durham research\u000d\u000a      findings (projects A and B, refs. 4 and 6) resulting in a more accurate\u000d\u000a      and informed picture of the current gaps in assessment and treatment\u000d\u000a      services across the UK and raising public awareness of the perspectives of\u000d\u000a      parents of children who have sexually abused. The failings of the child\u000d\u000a      protection system for families where sexual abuse is perpetrated by young\u000d\u000a      people was debated publically for the first time.\u000d\u000a    Examples of impact on practice within service providers\u000d\u000a      The research has influenced practice across a wide range of service\u000d\u000a      providers in both the voluntary and independent sectors, leading to direct\u000d\u000a      benefit to users. Barnardo's and NSPCC are the two main UK providers of\u000d\u000a      community based therapeutic services for young sexual abusers and this\u000d\u000a      section uses examples from these as reflective of broader changes across\u000d\u000a      the sector. Barnardo's Lighthouse Project (Edinburgh) has used findings on\u000d\u000a      families' experiences and the importance of engaging with families of\u000d\u000a      young abusers since 2008 (refs. 4 and 5, source 2) in training events and\u000d\u000a      in its staff induction pack. Similarly, the research (ref. 6, source 3) is\u000d\u000a      used as part of the training for new workers and according to the Deputy\u000d\u000a      Children's Services Manager \"generally all staff know the publication and\u000d\u000a      it is part of the work\" at Barnardo's Chilston Project (2012) (Tunbridge\u000d\u000a      Wells).\u000d\u000a    1.Holistic interventions\u000d\u000a    The research has informed the development of holistic, systemic and whole\u000d\u000a      family approaches to young sexual abusers and victims of sexual abuse. For\u000d\u000a      example, the Head of Strategy and Development at NSPCC said that the\u000d\u000a      research informs the organisation's approach to work with victims as well\u000d\u000a      as young abusers as the organisation builds on \"the knowledge from\u000d\u000a      [Hackett's research] work, for instance about taking a holistic approach\".\u000d\u000a      At Glebe House (Cambridge), a residential therapeutic community that\u000d\u000a      supports young men with harmful sexual behaviour, findings (project C,\u000d\u000a      ref. 3) have resulted in the development of a new family service (2010) as\u000d\u000a      part of the agency's relapse prevention approach and has \"had an impact on\u000d\u000a      the work done...in reinforcing how to talk about the children and young\u000d\u000a      people displaying sexual harmful behaviour\" (source 4). At Barnardo's\u000d\u000a      Chilston the research (projects C and F, refs. 2 and 5, source 3) has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the development of an increased focus on work with parents\u000d\u000a      and carers. At Barnardo's Bridgeway (Middlesbrough) the research (project\u000d\u000a      C, ref. 3) has led to the development of a new approach to assessment\u000d\u000a      involving families, entitled the `Family Day Assessment' that supports\u000d\u000a      practitioners to conduct initial assessments of safeguarding and safe care\u000d\u000a      plans using a whole family approach. At the Barnardo's Lighthouse project,\u000d\u000a      the findings on families of young abusers (project D, ref. 4) \"provided\u000d\u000a      the grounding for developing family group work for families with children\u000d\u000a      who displayed harmful sexual behaviour\" (source 2).\u000d\u000a    2. A shift from `abuse specific' to `resilience based' and \u000d\u000a      `developmental' approaches\u000d\u000a    Branas Isaf (North Wales), a specialist resource comprising five\u000d\u000a      residential units, has implemented a new intervention approach (2012)\u000d\u000a      focusing on protective factors as a result of the research (project F,\u000d\u000a      ref. 3, source 8). Barnardo's Taith service has moved from a focus on\u000d\u000a      problems and deficits towards an emphasis on strengths-based therapy (from\u000d\u000a      2008) (ref. 3, source 3). Similarly, Glebe House has developed a\u000d\u000a      resilience-based approach as a result of the research (project C, source\u000d\u000a      4) and has increased its face-to-face contact between professionals and\u000d\u000a      young people based on findings from users (ref. 4, source 4). According to\u000d\u000a      the Director of Glebe House, the research has \"influenced service\u000d\u000a      provision across the therapeutic community, for instance by focusing on\u000d\u000a      building resilience in the young person and taking a holistic approach to\u000d\u000a      the work. Before, the models used in work with adult sexual offenders were\u000d\u000a      transferred to the work with children and young people...which was\u000d\u000a      inappropriate\". Findings on desistance and long-term developmental\u000d\u000a      outcomes (project F, refs. 1 and 2), have further influenced the field in\u000d\u000a      refocusing treatment responses from short-term recidivism outcomes to a\u000d\u000a      renewed focus on long-term developmental outcomes. At Branas Isaf and\u000d\u000a      Glebe House, for example, this has included new employment schemes and an\u000d\u000a      increased emphasis on the provision of ongoing support after young people\u000d\u000a      have left residential care (sources 4 and 8). Specifically, Glebe House\u000d\u000a      has created a new post of Aftercare Support Worker (2013) as a direct\u000d\u000a      result of the findings (project F, refs. 1 and 2, source 4). \u000d\u000a    3.Research informed risk assessment\u000d\u000a    The research has helped to develop practice in relation to risk\u000d\u000a      assessment and risk management across agencies including at Glebe House\u000d\u000a      where \"Another important factor highlighted by the research is the\u000d\u000a      long-term risk of convictions. The work highlights the need to continue to\u000d\u000a      focus on long-term outcomes... and focus on the human factor in the work\u000d\u000a      with the YP\" (source 4). At Branas Isaf this includes the implementation\u000d\u000a      of a whole organisation approach to risk management as well as changes in\u000d\u000a      practice relating to sharing of assessment reports with referring agencies\u000d\u000a      (project B, ref. 1).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Between 25% and 33% of all perpetrators of sexual abuse in the UK are\u000d\u000a      children or young people.

From the 1990s and\u000d\u000a      throughout the 2000s there was growing professional concern about the\u000d\u000a      existence of young sexual abusers, but a lack of empirical research to\u000d\u000a      inform policy and practice. The Durham research has identified significant\u000d\u000a      gaps in assessment and treatment services and has challenged the\u000d\u000a      applicability of research on adult sex offenders to young people, leading\u000d\u000a      to the development of new services and a paradigm shift towards focusing\u000d\u000a      on young people holistically, including their offence specific and broader\u000d\u000a      developmental needs. This research has comprised:\u000d\u000a    A. The first research into national and local policy relating to\u000d\u000a      adolescent sexual offending across the UK and the Republic of Ireland in\u000d\u000a      order to establish the adequacy of official guidance in the management of\u000d\u000a      young sexual abusers within multi-agency systems. We found that 76% of 143\u000d\u000a      local areas had established inter-agency policies. However, tremendous\u000d\u000a      variations were found in the length and quality of policy and procedural\u000d\u000a      guidance and substantial differences uncovered in how young sexual abusers\u000d\u000a      are managed across localities and regions (section 3, ref. 6).\u000d\u000a    B. The most comprehensive survey of the state of service provision across\u000d\u000a      five nations including the nature of services provided, their capacity,\u000d\u000a      theoretical orientation, the nature of referrals received and gaps in\u000d\u000a      services. We found widespread concern about the availability and quality\u000d\u000a      of assessment, intervention and residential provision locally. We also\u000d\u000a      highlighted the need to integrate better youth justice and child welfare\u000d\u000a      responses to this user group (section 3, ref. 5 and 6).\u000d\u000a    C. A review of the nature of assessment and treatment models and\u000d\u000a      approaches in the UK and Ireland and the development of practice\u000d\u000a      principles and best practice approaches undertaken through Delphi studies\u000d\u000a      of 78 experienced practitioners and 65 managers of services for young\u000d\u000a      sexual abusers highlighting the need for a shift away from `abuse\u000d\u000a      specific' approaches to developmentally sensitive, resilience based models\u000d\u000a      (section 3, ref. 3).\u000d\u000a    D. The first published study of the experiences and views of 23 young\u000d\u000a      sexual offenders and parents about the professional responses to their\u000d\u000a      families and their experiences of the child welfare and criminal justice\u000d\u000a      systems. This research highlighted the importance of supportive\u000d\u000a      interventions, including whole-family approaches (section 3, ref. 4).\u000d\u000a    E. The largest British demographic study of the individual, family and\u000d\u000a      abuse characteristics of 700 young sexual abusers. Particularly high rates\u000d\u000a      of sexual and non-sexual victimisation were present in the backgrounds of\u000d\u000a      the children and young people referred, emphasising the need for holistic\u000d\u000a      interventions (section 3, ref. 1).\u000d\u000a    F. The first long-term outcome study of 86 young sexual abusers between\u000d\u000a      10 and 20 years following the end of professional interventions in\u000d\u000a      childhood, identifying risk and protective factors associated with\u000d\u000a      developmental and lifecourse outcomes. We found that a small proportion\u000d\u000a      (6%) had sexually reoffended, but long-term outcomes varied substantially.\u000d\u000a      The study provided the first international empirical data on desistance in\u000d\u000a      this group into adulthood, with findings highlighting the importance of\u000d\u000a      long-term professional support, stable partner relationships, educational\u000d\u000a      success and employment as factors most positively influencing the\u000d\u000a      lifecourse of this group (section 3, ref. 2).\u000d\u000a    The above studies were led by Professor Simon Hackett (Lecturer then\u000d\u000a      Senior Lecturer in Applied Social Sciences 1999-2005; Reader then\u000d\u000a      Professor in Applied Social Sciences 2006-date).

The book's emphasis on\u000a      complex systems applied to public health resonated with the RD's ambition\u000a      to restore a public health focus in WHO Europe's programme of work.\u000a      Central to the RD's purpose was a new policy framework and health\u000a      strategy, Health 2020, to be accompanied by an action plan, the European\u000a        Action Plan for Strengthening Public Health Capacities and Services.\u000a      The EAP draws directly on, and is underpinned by, the 3 research studies\u000a      described in sections 2 and 3. WHO describes the EAP as constituting `one\u000a      of the main pillars of Health 2020' (Source 3), which aims to support\u000a      action across government and society to `significantly improve the health\u000a      and well-being of populations, reduce health inequalities, strengthen\u000a      public health and ensure people-centred health systems that are universal,\u000a      equitable, sustainable and of high quality' (Source 4). The Plan is\u000a      structured around 10 avenues for action. Each avenue incorporates an\u000a      overview of key themes, and support and development activities to be\u000a      provided by all 53 WHO Member States, the WHO Regional Office for Europe\u000a      Secretariat and its partners.\u000a    The EAP represented a departure for WHO since previous health strategies\u000a      had not been accompanied by an action plan. Implementation and delivery\u000a      were viewed as critical and achieving agreement over actions given the\u000a      complexity of public health systems across a diverse range of countries\u000a      all at different stages of development posed a major challenge. The\u000a      research from Durham conceptualising public health systems was therefore\u000a      seen to be both timely and highly relevant to WHO's purposes and informed\u000a      their thinking. At the outset, Hunter was invited to co-facilitate a high\u000a      level internal meeting of senior public health officials at WHO's Regional\u000a      Office for Europe in Copenhagen (November 2010). The terms of reference\u000a      were `to review concepts, definitions, boundaries and activities and to\u000a      advise WHO accordingly' in the context of the key public health and health\u000a      policy challenges in Europe, `including particularly that to strengthen\u000a      key public health capacity and services'. The meeting led to an agreed\u000a      programme of work with Hunter and Marks from 2010-12. The first output was\u000a      a framework for action document which was approved by Member States at the\u000a      61st Regional Committee in September 2011 (Sources 1 and 2).\u000a      The framework served as the basis for subsequent work on developing the\u000a      EAP. Working closely with senior WHO officials and advisers, Hunter and\u000a      Marks had a decisive impact on the overall shape, structure and content of\u000a      the EAP as borne out by the testimonies received.\u000a    International Public Health Expert and WHO Programme Manager for Public\u000a      Health Services at the time said:\u000a    `It was exactly at this conceptual phase that Prof Hunter's and Linda\u000a        Marks' research and input had an impact on the further production of the\u000a        European Action Plan. They developed a draft concept paper which was\u000a        debated in an expert working group workshop at the end of November 2010\u000a        and, after some revisions, became the solid theoretical basis for\u000a        developing the first drafts of the future Action Plan.'\u000a    Hunter was invited to join the newly established Public Health Expert\u000a      Reference group at WHO to advise officials on the EAP. Its members\u000a      included academics and senior government health advisers from the UK,\u000a      Israel, Hungary, and Sweden. At the same time, both Hunter and Marks were\u000a      appointed as Special Advisors with WHO Europe and commissioned to work\u000a      with their staff to produce the EAP for wish Member States reaffirmed\u000a      their support at the 61st Regional Committee in September 2011.\u000a      Hunter and Marks led on the drafting of the Plan for final adoption by the\u000a      Regional Committee at its 62nd session in 2012.\u000a    The Programme Manager for Public Health Services at WHO at the time\u000a      confirmed: `They, as a team, were the main writers throughout the whole\u000a        process which evolved in two states:\u000a    Stage 1: development and endorsement of a policy\u000a        document, e.g. the Framework, and\u000a      Stage 2: development, consultation and revisions of the\u000a        European Action Plan itself.\u000a    They were not only writers but they were facilitators in the long\u000a        consultation process, thus, helping to convince our end-beneficiaries on\u000a        one side, and supporting WHO Europe to better understand and incorporate\u000a        the various views, opinions and standpoints.' Senior Advisor Health\u000a      Policy WHO Regional Office for Europe said:\u000a    `Their (Hunter and Marks') work had a profound influence. They\u000a        provided a robust philosophical and scientific basis for conceptualizing\u000a        public health, as well as a practical vision for how public health\u000a        services might be delivered and strengthened.'\u000a    Hunter and Marks' principal contribution was to develop a series of\u000a      avenues to action (which drew directly on the research reported in section\u000a      3) and a number of mid-term actions for Member States and WHO based on the\u000a      concept of complex public health systems which informed the research\u000a      projects described in section 2. The avenues parallel 10 Essential Public\u000a      Health Operations (EPHOs) which take the form of a checklist. While the\u000a      EPHOs represent the end points of the EAP, the avenues for action\u000a      represent the means by which these end points will be attained through\u000a      detailing the actions to be taken by Member States and WHO.\u000a    Following several iterations over a period of 18 months, the EAP (Source\u000a      3) was finalised after a consultation process with Member States and\u000a      feedback from discussions at the European High Level Policy Forum meetings\u000a      in Andorra (March 2011), Israel (November 2011) and Brussels (April 2012),\u000a      and two sub-regional technical consultations in Helsinki (January 2012)\u000a      and Brussels (March 2012). Hunter attended and participated in all of\u000a      these meetings. The EAP was endorsed in September 2012 by all 53 Member\u000a      States (Source 5).\u000a    WHO will monitor the progress and impact of the EAP, offering assistance\u000a      to Member States in its implementation. To help advance these tasks in\u000a      collaboration with WHO, and in recognition of the relevance of its\u000a      research to the development and implementation of the EAP, the CPPH has\u000a      been invited to become a WHO Collaborating Centre on Complex Health\u000a      Systems Research, Knowledge and Action led by Hunter and Marks. The\u000a      importance of the Centre's research has led to Hunter being made a member\u000a      of the WHO Europe Steering Group on the EAP established to progress the\u000a      implementation of the EAP and to reporting on this to Member States at the\u000a      Regional Committee at its 66th session in 2016. In addition,\u000a      Hunter is chairing the WHO working group on advancing public health\u000a      research to inform policy and practice (avenue for action 10, and EPHO\u000a      10). He is also taking part in a closed meeting of selected WHO public\u000a      health experts in Tallinn, Estonia to agree a road map for the EAP's\u000a      implementation.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Durham University's Centre for Public Policy and Health (CPPH) has worked\u000a      closely with the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Regional Office for\u000a      Europe to help design the European Action Plan for Strengthening\u000a        Public Health Capacities and Services.

These studies were\u000a      conducted by CPPH teams led by the Centre's Director &#8212; Hunter (Professor\u000a      of Health Policy &amp; Management, 1999-) and Marks (Senior Research\u000a      Fellow, 2001-).\u000a    A book based on the findings of the first study (Section 3, Ref 1), a\u000a      commissioned scoping study on the development of public health policy and\u000a      practice, provided the underpinning context for a programme of public\u000a      health research, including the other two studies described below (Section\u000a      3, Refs 2-5). The research employed a complex systems approach, not\u000a      previously applied to the topic, to identify the particular nature of, and\u000a      challenges facing, public health policy and practice and to provide a\u000a      conceptual framework for understanding and exploring possible ways of\u000a      meeting these. The framework is generic and may be applied to public\u000a      health systems in different countries.\u000a    The second study found that partnerships in public health were more\u000a      complex than those in health and social care services, that they had\u000a      multiple sets of boundaries, and comprised a broader range of partner\u000a      agencies. The study was the first to investigate public health\u000a      partnerships in this depth. Collective leadership emerged as vital, and\u000a      within complex partnerships relationships were more important than\u000a      structures. The study contributed to new ways of thinking about\u000a      partnerships in complex settings and challenged prevailing assumptions\u000a      about their value, purpose and impact. It also identified the skills and\u000a      competencies required to make partnerships more effective. The study's\u000a      originality and contribution to knowledge lay in bringing these findings\u000a      together within a framework derived from systems thinking which had not\u000a      been previously been applied to public health (Section 3, Refs 2-3).\u000a    The third study focused on the relationships between governance,\u000a      commissioning and public health. It developed the concept of `public\u000a      health governance' and was the first study to explore the impact of\u000a      different dimensions of governance on commissioning for health and\u000a      wellbeing at a local level (Ref 4). It considered underlying principles of\u000a      governance, governance arrangements (such as targets, audit and the use of\u000a      incentives) and decision-making approaches and analysed how each of these\u000a      influenced local strategies and priorities. The study demonstrated the\u000a      complexity of the governance landscape for public health, the leadership\u000a      qualities required to negotiate it, and contributed to understanding the\u000a      processes involved in addressing a governance deficit in public health.\u000a    The research underpinning the three studies was collated to provide the\u000a      theoretical and conceptual framework adopted by WHO in the design and\u000a      development of the EAP and to frame the avenues for action which comprised\u000a      the Plan (Section 3, Ref 6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14291","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The `Standards We Expect' project evidenced the value of a particular\u000d\u000a      model of social care reform, which addressed both bottom-up and top-down\u000d\u000a      processes. This twin track approach to achieving change has been reflected\u000d\u000a      in a range of impacts. Impacts took place after the publication of the\u000d\u000a      interim findings (2008); during the main project phase (2008-2010) and\u000d\u000a      during the dissemination\/influencing phase (2010-2013).\u000d\u000a    1. Impacts on society.\u000d\u000a    1.1 Political debate and social care reform was advanced through\u000d\u000a      the provision of high profile evidence to policymakers, politicians; and\u000d\u000a      leaders; it challenged established norms of social care delivery and\u000d\u000a      shifted existing understandings of the way in which person-centred support\u000d\u000a      should be optimally implemented. Evidence from the first stage findings\u000d\u000a      were fed into the Health Select Committee Inquiry into Social Care as\u000d\u000a      invited oral evidence and numerous regional, national, international\u000d\u000a      research, policy and professional forums. The `final summary' research\u000d\u000a      findings were showcased at an invited parliamentary launch. Formal oral\u000d\u000a      evidence was subsequently invited and presented to key government bodies,\u000d\u000a      through consultations and inquiries including the Ministerial Reference\u000d\u000a      Group for Social Care; Social Work Reform Board; Dilnot Commission\u000d\u000a      Reference Group; Transforming Adult Social Care Programme Board; and the\u000d\u000a      Adult Social Care WorkForce Strategy Board. Findings were also drawn upon\u000d\u000a      by the National Commission on Personalisation established and conducted by\u000d\u000a      Hampshire County Council. The Minister for Social Care and his lead civil\u000d\u000a      servant held two Ministerial roundtables for social care leaders;\u000d\u000a      Beresford presented formal evidence at both. The Minister reported reading\u000d\u000a      the research publications, and as a result had formally noted that the\u000d\u000a      forthcoming white paper on social care reform needed to include service\u000d\u000a      user involvement.\u000d\u000a    1.2 Public debate was influenced through significant media\u000d\u000a      coverage including two Radio 4 You and Yours Specials on Social Care\u000d\u000a      Reform, Radio 5 Wake Up To Money, a Guardian and Community Care\u000d\u000a      (professional journal) article, blog and podcast, plus interviews for\u000d\u000a      Housing and Public Finance, radio and wide coverage in user led and\u000d\u000a      disabled people's media including blogs, social networking sites etc. This\u000d\u000a      reflected both top and bottom interest; resulting in additional major\u000d\u000a      conference invitations.\u000d\u000a    1.3 Economic impacts were achieved through better access to\u000d\u000a      financial opportunities for services users and carers through the enhanced\u000d\u000a      use of direct payments and personal budgets. For example, a group of\u000d\u000a      people with learning difficulties were supported to produce an easy\u000d\u000a      read\/illustrated version of the project's findings, which subsequently\u000d\u000a      supported other people with learning difficulties to access and make use\u000d\u000a      of person-centred care.\u000d\u000a    1.4 Equality and diversity was advanced through ensuring that age,\u000d\u000a      ethnicity, nature of impairment, gender, sexuality, class, culture and\u000d\u000a      belief were fairly attended to through the policy reforms. This was\u000d\u000a      achieved through the project design and dissemination e.g. invited oral\u000d\u000a      evidence was delivered to the Joint (Parliamentary) Committee on Human\u000d\u000a      Rights, Disabled People and Independent Living (June 2011). Improved\u000d\u000a      social inclusion was achieved through involving service users as\u000d\u000a      researchers in the development phase of the project, in its formulation,\u000d\u000a      governance, and in shaping its dissemination strategy. This equalised\u000d\u000a      research relations and supported the empowerment of service users\/disabled\u000d\u000a      people in bringing about broader change.\u000d\u000a    2. Impacts on health and welfare: impact on practitioners and\u000d\u000a      professional services were achieved through the development of accessible\u000d\u000a      evidence based information, training, and support for service users,\u000d\u000a      practitioners, carers and their organisations. These have facilitated\u000d\u000a      optimal implementation of person-centred support in the UK.\u000d\u000a    2.1 The first evidence based practical guides were produced for\u000d\u000a      service users, practitioners and carers. These included the consensus\u000d\u000a      definition of what person centred support means to people who use, work in\u000d\u000a      and manage UK services; identifying what the barriers are to providing it\u000d\u000a      and how those barriers can be overcome: the guides included one written by\u000d\u000a      and for people with learning disabilities, an exemplar of a local case\u000d\u000a      study, a guide on choices for the end of life, a guide for practitioners,\u000d\u000a      a guide for service users, and a guide to personalisation training\u000d\u000a      approaches. These gave both detailed local research findings (as models\u000d\u000a      for others wishing to take forward similar work locally) and provided\u000d\u000a      practical research-based guidance for practitioners, service users and\u000d\u000a      carers wanting to take forward person-centred support. Forewords by key\u000d\u000a      people in each field positioned them influentially. For example, four of\u000d\u000a      the six:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Croft, S. Bewley, C.

Practitioners, their organisations, carers and\u000d\u000a      service users and their organisations, both in local sites and more\u000d\u000a      generally have reported the gains from the project's learning and\u000d\u000a      highlighted the value of adopting them. For practitioners, the impacts\u000d\u000a      have included enhanced capacity to practice in a more\u000d\u000a      person-centred\/personalised way and, for service users and carers,\u000d\u000a      enhanced ability to access and press for such support. Service users and\u000d\u000a      carers have been empowered through information, support and partnership\u000d\u000a      working, to access person-centred support and influence the provision of\u000d\u000a      policy.\u000d\u000a    2.3 Improved social care services: through its development phase,\u000d\u000a      the project directly impacted on eight service sites and a wider network\u000d\u000a      of 12 service settings, supporting them to work in more person-centred\u000d\u000a      ways, as well as supporting service users and carers associated with\u000d\u000a      sites. Over 350 people have directly benefitted through being involved in\u000d\u000a      the implementation sites; they have benefitted from more effective person\u000d\u000a      centred support, knowledge exchange, training opportunities and practical\u000d\u000a      support. Three information exchange and developmental national\u000d\u000a      `get-together' events have facilitated national implementation and\u000d\u000a      enhanced social care services.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The importance of person-centred social support has been recognised by\u000d\u000a      successive governments as central to the development of effective and\u000d\u000a      supportive social care services. The research led by Brunel and funded by\u000d\u000a      the DoH and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, made a substantial\u000d\u000a      contribution to the enhancement of UK social care policy and practice in\u000d\u000a      relation to the personalisation agenda. Parliamentary committees and\u000d\u000a      policy consultation used the research to develop new social care policy.\u000d\u000a      Standards of service care delivery were developed and implemented in\u000d\u000a      partnership with service users; these were adopted at a policy and\u000d\u000a      practice level. The development and use of evidence based practice guides,\u000d\u000a      training programmes and web resources facilitated the successful adoption\u000d\u000a      and implementation of person-centred support nationwide. In summary,\u000d\u000a      public debate was influenced, equality and empowerment for service users\u000d\u000a      was advanced, national policy and practice enhanced, health and welfare\u000d\u000a      improved and economic impacts achieved.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    BRUNEL UNIVERSITY (H0113)\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Brunel University","InstitutionName":"Brunel University","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10000961}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

In\u000d\u000a      1995, Beresford and Harding were awarded funding from DoH (&#163;30K), to\u000d\u000a      identify service users' and carers' views about the delivery of social\u000d\u000a      care services in England and Wales. Together with Harding, who was Policy\u000d\u000a      Officer for the National Institute for Social Work at that time, Beresford\u000d\u000a      published `The Standards We Expect: what service users and carers want\u000d\u000a      from social services workers'1.\u000d\u000a    The report fuelled a need to identify how the aspirations of service\u000d\u000a      users could be met which led to the Joseph Rountree Foundation (JRF)\u000d\u000a      issuing a call, entitled `The Standards We Expect'. Beresford, led a\u000d\u000a      successful funding bid (&#163;500,000), in collaboration with a Branfield and\u000d\u000a      Turner from Shaping Our Lives (service user organisation), Bewley &amp;\u000d\u000a      Dattani-Pitt from Values into Action (collaboration of non-disabled and\u000d\u000a      disabled people), Fleming from the Centre for Social Action (De Montfort\u000d\u000a      University) and individual experts including Butt, Flynn, Croft, Patmore.\u000d\u000a      Glynn was employed as the project worker for the 2007-2011 project period.\u000d\u000a      The project aimed to identify: what person centred support means to people\u000d\u000a      who use, work in and manage services and what barriers and facilitators\u000d\u000a      there are to implementation.\u000d\u000a    At the time the study was funded, the government, through Putting People\u000d\u000a      First (2007), wanted to transform social care; they introduced the\u000d\u000a      personalisation approach\/ person-centred approach as the primary model for\u000d\u000a      future social care. However there was a lack of evidence to support how\u000d\u000a      person centred policy could be best be implemented. The JRF study was\u000d\u000a      ideally timed as it would supply that evidence.\u000d\u000a    The JRF project adopted a user controlled research methodology, with\u000d\u000a      service users at the heart of collaborations with key stakeholders. Key\u000d\u000a      concerns of such research were to equalise research relations across\u000d\u000a      service users and researchers through supporting the empowerment of\u000d\u000a      service users. This approach entailed service users as researchers in the\u000d\u000a      development phase of the project, in its formulation, governance and in\u000d\u000a      shaping its dissemination strategy, which was determinedly participatory\u000d\u000a      in nature.\u000d\u000a    Eight research and development sites and 12 service network sites were\u000d\u000a      set up involving over 350 individuals. In each site, activities included\u000d\u000a      the creation and support of forums for each stakeholder group so that they\u000d\u000a      could come together to develop and exchange their knowledge and experience\u000d\u000a      and collaboratively implement the 11 standards of person-centred support;\u000d\u000a      their activity was monitored, analysed and collated as research findings\u000d\u000a      and evidence.\u000d\u000a    Findings were reported in JRF interim report2 and final\u000d\u000a      summary3, as well as in a book4. These findings\u000d\u000a      highlighted that there was a strong consensus as to the meaning of person\u000d\u000a      centred care, that there was support for its implementation and for the\u000d\u000a      eleven standards for enhancing service care delivery were proposed.\u000d\u000a      Through the development sites, it was apparent that implementation was\u000d\u000a      achievable and that many of the barriers could be overcome. However, two\u000d\u000a      barriers, which were not possible to overcome at a local level, which\u000d\u000a      needed to be overcome before mainstream implementation was achievable,\u000d\u000a      were the continued existence of an antagonistic\/institutionalising culture\u000d\u000a      in services and the chronically inadequate level of social care funding.\u000d\u000a    Evidence from the interim report were fed into a number of stakeholder\u000d\u000a      forums: the Health Select Committee Inquiry into Social Care, as invited\u000d\u000a      oral evidence; regional, national and international research, policy and\u000d\u000a      professional conferences and events; key government bodies' consultations\u000d\u000a      and inquiries e.g Ministerial Reference Group for Social Care including\u000d\u000a      the Department of Health, Transforming Adult Social Care Programme Board,\u000d\u000a      Adult Social Care Work Force Strategy Board, Social Work Reform Board,\u000d\u000a      Ministerial Group for Adult Social Care and Dilnot Commission Reference\u000d\u000a      Group. In addition the findings were discussed with Ministers and lead\u000d\u000a      civil servants, through a Society Guardian Round table and a launch event.\u000d\u000a      The `Shaping Our Lives' user-led organisation which grew from the original\u000d\u000a      1996 report, was then funded as a Department of Health Strategic Partner.\u000d\u000a    JRF funded an additional two year `influencing stage' in 2010-12 (&#163;97k)\u000d\u000a      to maximise the impact of the research findings; this award was used to\u000d\u000a      fund a number of activities and the publication of guides, resources and\u000d\u000a      training programmes to promote the implementation of person centred\u000d\u000a      support.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14378","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research on individual victims of fraud has had a significant impact\u000d\u000a      on policy development by\u000d\u000a      public, private and voluntary bodies in relation to the services and\u000d\u000a      structures created to support\u000d\u000a      fraud victims.

One area which was\u000d\u000a      particularly highlighted by the\u000d\u000a      research was the gap in support for SMEs.

This implements many of the provisions advocated by the\u000d\u000a      Code of Practice for\u000d\u000a      Victims of Crime, such as keeping victims up-to-date with the progress of\u000d\u000a      the case and providing a\u000d\u000a      sympathetic response, amongst others (SFO, 2009 and 2013).

The findings have also influenced how\u000d\u000a      bodies such as CIFAS,\u000d\u000a      which deals with large numbers of fraud victims, organises their campaigns\u000d\u000a      and services for\u000d\u000a      victims, as the Deputy Head of Financial Crime and Strategic Intelligence\u000d\u000a      from CIFAS noted in\u000d\u000a      relation to the research, it:\u000d\u000a    \"has proved an important part of the foundation on which subsequent\u000d\u000a        awareness campaigns have\u000d\u000a        been built.\"\u000d\u000a    This research has also had a very positive impact in supporting the\u000d\u000a      actual victims of fraud and their\u000d\u000a      families. There is often a presumption that victims are `greedy' and that\u000d\u000a      it is partly their own fault\u000d\u000a      they were victimised. The research highlighted this attitude in many\u000d\u000a      organisations and has led\u000d\u000a      some to reconsider how they do this (see SFO, 2013). One group which\u000d\u000a      represents victims of\u000d\u000a      `scams', Think Jessica and CIFAS have found the research very\u000d\u000a      useful in helping to articulate their\u000d\u000a      case to government and other bodies, noting:\u000d\u000a    \"The research served to highlight the previously under-emphasised\u000d\u000a        emotional toll of this type of\u000d\u000a        crime.\"\u000d\u000a    Think Jessica stated in their letter that the research:\u000d\u000a    \"had been invaluable in highlighting the financial and mental\u000d\u000a        devastation..\"\u000d\u000a    of fraud on victims and that as a result of the research:\u000d\u000a    \"...existing and new bodies have taken these victims more seriously.\"\u000d\u000a    The NFA Chief Executive also confirmed the importance of this in helping\u000d\u000a      to articulate the case of\u000d\u000a      fraud victims, stating:\u000d\u000a    \"...through the large scale telephone survey which was conducted and\u000d\u000a        the many tragic case\u000d\u000a        studies described in the report.

One was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the NFA,\u000d\u000a      Association of Chief Police Officers and OFT and involved Professor Mark\u000d\u000a      Button and Dr. Jacki\u000d\u000a      Tapley. The second project was commissioned by the Sentencing Council and\u000d\u000a      was undertaken by\u000d\u000a      Mark Button in partnership with research staff from the National Centre\u000d\u000a      for Social Research\u000d\u000a      (NatCen). The two research projects were both awarded as a result of\u000d\u000a      national competitive\u000d\u000a      tendering processes involving multiple bids and the results have been\u000d\u000a      published in four official\u000d\u000a      reports and so far, given the recent completion of the research (2009 and\u000d\u000a      2013), the findings have\u000d\u000a      also been developed into two articles in high quality peer reviewed\u000d\u000a      journals.\u000d\u000a    The first project was the largest study to date in the UK of individual\u000d\u000a      victims of fraud, involving\u000d\u000a      telephone interviews with 745 victims and over 30 face-to-face interviews,\u000d\u000a      amongst other research\u000d\u000a      strategies. This research clearly dispelled the myth of fraud as a\u000d\u000a      `victimless' crime, exposing the\u000d\u000a      devastating impacts on victims, such as: the deterioration of physical and\u000d\u000a      mental health; the\u000d\u000a      psychological impact such as anger, leading to strained family\u000d\u000a      relationships; and the more obvious\u000d\u000a      financial impact.\u000d\u000a    The research also found that there was a perplexing mix of agencies\u000d\u000a      offering gateways to report\u000d\u000a      fraud and offer support. This was confusing to many and led some on a\u000d\u000a      `merry-go-round' of having\u000d\u000a      to approach multiple agencies just to try and report the fraud, before\u000d\u000a      they even sought help. There\u000d\u000a      was also wide variation in the support services provided, with some gaps\u000d\u000a      in the provision of\u000d\u000a      services for certain groups highlighted, particularly for SMEs. Linked to\u000d\u000a      this was the dismissive way\u000d\u000a      many victims were treated by the police and other agencies, with some also\u000d\u000a      being blamed for their\u000d\u000a      victimisation. Examples were exposed of victims having to write to MPs,\u000d\u000a      utilise contacts and\u000d\u000a      `scream and shout' just to secure a response from the police.\u000d\u000a    The research also highlighted that the Code of Practice for Victims of\u000d\u000a      Crime did not cover a\u000d\u000a      number of agencies which dealt with victims of fraud, such as the SFO,\u000d\u000a      trading standards\u000d\u000a      departments and financial institutions. The research made 11\u000d\u000a      recommendations to the government\u000d\u000a      and agencies supporting victims, many of which have been implemented,\u000d\u000a      including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The creation of a single point of call website providing extensive\u000d\u000a        resources to victims.\u000d\u000a      The provision of special support for SMEs.\u000d\u000a      Widening the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime to other bodies,\u000d\u000a        such as the SFO.\u000d\u000a      A call for further research on the sentences received by perpetrators\u000d\u000a        of fraud.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The second project was commissioned by the Sentencing Council to explore\u000d\u000a      the nature of online\u000d\u000a      fraud, the impact on victims and their views on sentencing (Kerr et al\u000d\u000a      2013). This research\u000d\u000a      involved a further 15 interviews with online fraud victims and six focus\u000d\u000a      groups that included 48\u000d\u000a      victims. This research highlighted the innovative ways perpetrators use to\u000d\u000a      trap victims and the\u000d\u000a      devastating impact online frauds can have. The research also illustrated\u000d\u000a      that the impact of being a\u000d\u000a      victim of fraud was more important than the actual size of the loss.\u000d\u000a    The two projects have identified three key areas of findings. First,\u000d\u000a      inadequate organisational\u000d\u000a      structures for the provision of services to fraud victims, requiring\u000d\u000a      greater central coordination.\u000d\u000a      Second, the significant impact of fraud on victims, with the level of\u000d\u000a      financial loss not necessarily\u000d\u000a      that important. Third, gaps in the provision of services provided by\u000d\u000a      bodies to fraud victims.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14379","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"1820814","Name":"Brunei"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research findings in respect of police interview training and the use of\u000a      the CI have provided police forces world-wide with the evidence base to\u000a      both improve the training of police officers throughout their careers and\u000a      has allowed implementation of new, innovative techniques valuable in\u000a      working with vulnerable individuals. Improved, reliable, interviewing\u000a      plays an important part in the justice process, and appropriate handling\u000a      of vulnerable individuals improves their access to justice.\u000a    The Clarke and Milne report, widely published following the research\u000a      project, made a number of recommendations for police interviewing. Many of\u000a      the recommendations have been implemented. Amongst the most apparent\u000a      changes is the adoption of the recommended Tiered approach to developing\u000a      an interviewers skills across their career, which was fully adopted by the\u000a      UK police as a result of the report and has formed part of the UK\u000a      government's \"Professionalising the Investigative Process\" (PIP) agenda\u000a      and associated National Occupation Standards. The Tiered approach has also\u000a      been adopted by the New Zealand Police Force, Australian Federal Police\u000a      and two Australian Territories. The uptake in these locations stemmed from\u000a      dissemination work by Dr Milne who met with Police representatives and\u000a      gave presentations on the team's research.\u000a    The group's research into the CI (Fisher, Milne &amp; Bull, 2011) has\u000a      encouraged the adoption of the CI by police organisations across the world\u000a      (in North America, Europe, Australasia, Asia and Africa). The research has\u000a      been used by Milne to develop teaching materials and training packages for\u000a      Police Investigators, training investigators from across the world,\u000a      including from the UK, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus,\u000a      Germany, Malta, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. The training has continued\u000a      to be enriched by ongoing research and Milne has been able to incorporate\u000a      her most recent work on interviewing vulnerable groups, interviewing\u000a      suspects and critical failure points (which can lead to miscarriages of\u000a      justice) into the training.\u000a    As a result of her research, Milne has been asked to advise several\u000a      national policing bodies on the use of interview techniques appropriate to\u000a      vulnerable groups and has drawn upon the team's research findings to\u000a      provide appropriate advice. The research study on sexual offences was\u000a      cited within the Stern Review in which Baroness Stern examined the\u000a      investigation of rape within the UK and led directly to changes in police\u000a      interviewing behaviour at the `coal-face' by developing actual interview\u000a      techniques that officers can utilise in the field, by advancing training\u000a      programmes, and at a strategic level by influencing police policy.\u000a    The research findings with respect to the innate skills require for\u000a      successful training as an investigative interviewer have forced\u000a      organisations to examine their training policies and to adapt selection\u000a      processes, both in terms of selecting officers for advanced interview\u000a      training and for roles in the force.\u000a    The research findings have informed Milne's work as an invited member of\u000a      a specialist database of experts for the UK police service (National Crime\u000a      Agency; since 2002). She has acted as an expert witness in court\u000a      proceedings and as a subject matter expert in real investigations using\u000a      her expertise and research results to advise on the best ways to interview\u000a      various individuals in an enquiry (e.g. current case: Savile inquiry). As\u000a      an elected member of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO)\u000a      Investigative Interviewing Strategic Steering Group (a group whose role is\u000a      to direct national strategy, policy and practice in the UK) Milne has been\u000a      able to inform discussions at the highest level in UK policing with the\u000a      latest research outcomes from the team's research work. As a result of her\u000a      work for the UK police she was the first (and only) academic awarded by\u000a      ACPO, the Tom Williamson Award for outstanding achievement in the field of\u000a      investigative interviewing (2009).

There was an average\u000a      of 630,000 viewers per episode on the first showing, the programmes\u000a      reached a wide audience and raised the public profile of interviewing as a\u000a      highly important police skill.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Portsmouth research into effective use of the Cognitive\u000a      Interview (CI) by police forces in the UK and overseas has led to\u000a      recommendations for changes to training of police officers in this field\u000a      throughout their careers being adopted in several countries across the\u000a      world.

It was deemed\u000a      at the time that a primary reason for a lack of training transference was\u000a      the mode of the training itself (not practical enough).\u000a    More recently, Milne's work has examined interviewing skills within\u000a      certain crime types; specifically sexual offence investigations. A\u000a      national evaluation was undertaken with NPIA (National Police Improvement\u000a      Agency) examining this highly sensitive area of police work, where real\u000a      life victim interviews were analysed, revealing again that there was an\u000a      overall, but widely varying, deficiency in skill levels among interviewing\u000a      officers. These individual differences were replicated in work conducted\u000a      in Australia (with Prof Powell and Prof Kebbell) where the research\u000a      focused on interviews of suspects in child abuse investigations. This\u000a      latter research revealed that the ability to learn to conduct an effective\u000a      interview for policing purposes is not something that all police officers\u000a      are capable of doing to the standard necessary for effective interviewing\u000a      in sensitive circumstances. The studies also concluded that for those with\u000a      the basic skills to be able to be trained, the correct delivery of career\u000a      long training and continuing professional development is vital for\u000a      optimising interviewing skills and improving the quality of interviewing.\u000a    Research focussing on the use of the Cognitive Interview (CI) &#8212; when\u000a      investigating police officers who were trained according to the tiered\u000a      approach recommended by Dr Milne's earlier work &#8212; as an innovative\u000a      technique in policing; has analysed its social and cognitive components\u000a      and their relative efficacy for use with vulnerable groups. This has\u000a      encompassed testing the underlying theory and empirical base. The CI has\u000a      been found to enhance recall significantly with all types of population;\u000a      including people with learning disabilities, the older adult and children.\u000a    One of the reasons for a lack of transference found in the Clarke and\u000a      Milne report was the fact that officers found the CI too cumbersome for\u000a      use in all types of interview (from road side information gathering\u000a      exercises to full visually recorded interviews). Thus the team developed a\u000a      new front-line police interview which has been piloted by forces in the UK\u000a      and the New Zealand Police.\u000a    Overall Milne's body of research has contributed to the theoretical\u000a      literature with regard to investigative interviewing skills transference\u000a      in the police and to individual difference.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14380","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    [Numbers in square brackets refer to underpinning research listed in\u000a        Section 3; letters and `Contact X' in square brackets refer to sources\u000a        used to corroborate the impact in Section 5.]\u000a    a) International Level\u000a    The reach and significance of Dooris' generic research on healthy\u000a      settings [2] is evidenced by his publications being cited on the WHO\u000a      Healthy Settings global web portal [A]. The Healthy Universities research\u000a      [1, 3, 4] was a catalyst to WHO reinvigorating its engagement with higher\u000a      education as a setting &#8212; and UCLan was acknowledged as key in the genesis\u000a      of Healthy Universities and being one of only two universities worldwide\u000a      to be linked from this portal [A]. Furthermore, Dooris is the European\u000a      Healthy Universities representative on a WHO Working Group on Implementing\u000a        Health 2020 and Strengthening Public Health through Improved\u000a        Collaboration and Synergy of Health Promotion Networks [Contact 1].\u000a    The generic settings [2] and criminal justice research [5, 6] in 2013\u000a      acted as a lever for the WHO Health in Prisons Project Steering Group to\u000a      prioritise international research into the whole system prison approach,\u000a      being undertaken by Baybutt and Dooris on behalf of its Collaborating\u000a      Centre.\u000a    The research [1-6] made a significant contribution to the decision of\u000a      IUHPE to adopt healthy settings as a priority theme and recognise\u000a      universities and prisons as important settings [Contact 1]. Dooris chaired\u000a      IUHPE's Global Working Group on Healthy Settings until 2011 and was a key\u000a      member of the Executive Scientific Committee for its 20th World\u000a      Conference in 2010, with lead responsibility for convening the conference\u000a      stream on healthy settings. A meeting convened by Dooris at this\u000a      conference led to the establishment of a European Health Promoting\u000a      Universities Network www.eurohpu.aau.dk:\u000a      this has 15 member countries, with Dooris as the UK focal point.\u000a      Additionally, Dooris was the invited keynote speaker leading the healthy\u000a      settings stream at 2012 IUHP European Conference and a key note speaker on\u000a      healthy settings at the 2013 Nordic Health Promotion Research Conference,\u000a      the 2013 Danish Public Health Society Annual Conference and the 2013\u000a      Australian Health Promotion Association Annual Conference. Baybutt was on\u000a      the planning group for the Healthy Settings sub-plenary at the 21st\u000a      World Health Promotion Conference in 2013 and the invited specialist\u000a      speaker on prisons, health and justice [Contact 1; Contact 2].\u000a    Dooris' work [2] underpins Section 4 of Ireland's 2011 Health Promotion\u000a      Strategic Framework [B], which explicitly draws on his conceptual research\u000a      &#8212; and the Irish Health Service Executive have commissioned Dooris' Healthy\u000a      Settings Unit to transfer the learning from their research through\u000a      developing and delivering a `train the trainers' course, extending the\u000a      impact into health promotion practice.\u000a    b) National Level\u000a    The Healthy Universities research [1, 3, 4] has made a significant\u000a      contribution to national strategy and guidance. Building on a case study\u000a      of UCLan's work within the earlier `Choosing Health' publication, the\u000a      Government's 2010 public health strategy reinforced the importance of\u000a      universities as a setting for health &#8212; stating that \"Healthy Schools,\u000a        Healthy Further Education and Healthy Universities programmes will\u000a        continue to be developed by their respective sectors, as voluntary\u000a        programmes, collaborating where appropriate and exploring partnership\u000a        working with business and voluntary bodies\" [C]. The inclusion of\u000a      Healthy Universities was clearly influenced by the work of Dooris and\u000a      colleagues and represented a significant achievement in an era of\u000a      `stripped down' government, offering continued legitimacy to the growing\u000a      number of HEIs adopting this whole system model of working [Contact 2].\u000a      Dooris is also an expert adviser to the Welsh Government in the\u000a      development of its own Healthy and Sustainable FE and HE Framework, which\u000a      draws extensively on the work of Dooris and colleagues [1, 3, 4] [Contact\u000a      3].\u000a    Research by Dooris and Doherty [1, 3] has been recognised and cited by\u000a      bodies such as Universities UK, National Union of Students and the Royal\u000a      College of Psychiatrists &#8212; the latter stating in 2011 that \"the\u000a        `Healthy Universities' systemic and holistic approach is commended and\u000a        should be adopted as widely as possible\" [D].\u000a    Research by Baybutt and colleagues [McAllister et al, Stirling\u000a      University) examining the benefits of adopting a whole system approach to\u000a      regional tobacco control has strengthened the evidence base and thereby\u000a      contributed to national-level policy debate [5].\u000a    c) Institutional and Population Level\u000a    Perhaps most significantly, the research has had far-reaching influence\u000a      on institutional practice, impacting on population health and wellbeing &#8212;\u000a      through the implementation of the Healthy Prisons model by establishments\u000a      across the North West region [Contact 4; and through the adoption of the\u000a      Healthy Universities approach by a growing number of HEIs within the UK\u000a      and internationally [E; Contact 2].\u000a    The research on prison-based wellbeing (with a particular focus on\u000a      horticultural and environmental projects) [6] has highlighted the reach of\u000a      such work (3828 beneficiaries) and the value of such activity in\u000a      transforming individual offenders' lives [Contacts 4-5]. Furthermore, it\u000a      has demonstrated the importance of adopting a whole-system approach that\u000a      addresses wellbeing, reoffending, citizenship and social justice agendas &#8212;\u000a      thereby levering further Big Lottery and National Offender Management\u000a      Service funding for Healthy Prison implementation and evaluation by\u000a      Baybutt and Dooris within North West establishments, with current interest\u000a      in wider roll-out into North West probation and other community settings\u000a      and into prisons beyond the region [Contacts 4-5]. Evaluative research of\u000a      offender health trainer services has led to wider roll-out within the\u000a      North West and strengthened the case for further investment in the work.\u000a    Building directly on their research [1, 3], Dooris and Doherty (with\u000a      Powell at MMU) were in 2009 awarded &#163;200,000 from HEFCE for an\u000a      implementation project Developing Leadership and Governance for\u000a        Healthy Universities www.healthyuniversities.ac.uk.\u000a      This enabled previous [1-3] and concurrent [4] research findings to inform\u000a      developments &#8212; and specifically for: the UCLan- convened National Network\u000a      to be formalised and expanded, with membership increasing from 47 HEIs and\u000a      10 other stakeholder organisations in 2008 to 73 HEIs and 22 other\u000a      stakeholder organisations in 2013; a website and toolkit to be developed,\u000a      facilitating the translation of research into practice through offering\u000a      guidance packages, case studies and a self-review tool; and advocacy and\u000a      leadership for Healthy Universities to be strengthened through a\u000a      high-level Leadership Advisory Group jointly chaired by the Chief\u000a      Executives of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education and the Royal\u000a      Society for Public Health [E; Contact 2]. The reach of this work is\u000a      evidenced by the extensive use of the website (9,043 unique visitors from\u000a      125 countries since its launch in 2010); the request from the Welsh\u000a      Assembly and HEIs outside of England for UCLan to widen the Network's\u000a      remit from England to the UK [Contact 3]; increased demand for `associate'\u000a      membership of the Network by HEIs in countries outside of the UK (e.g.\u000a      Australia; Canada; Ireland; New Zealand); and requests for Dooris and\u000a      Doherty to act as advisers and to speak at Healthy University events (e.g.\u000a      Simon Fraser University, Canada; University of Sydney, Australia;\u000a      University of Calgary, Qatar; University of Extremedura, Spain).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Healthy Settings Unit at UCLan www.uclan.ac.uk\/hsu\u000a      has contributed to the adoption of the `whole system' settings approach to\u000a      the promotion of health and wellbeing within a range of sectors nationally\u000a      and internationally &#8212; including higher education and criminal justice.\u000a      This impact has included: recognition of higher education as a key setting\u000a      for health improvement by the UK Government, World Health Organization\u000a      (WHO) and International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE);\u000a      implementation of Healthy Universities as a model for promoting student,\u000a      staff and community wellbeing by an expanding number of higher education\u000a      institutions (HEIs) within the UK and globally; and investment in and\u000a      roll-out of a whole system Healthy Prison model across North West England\u000a      &#8212; stimulating extensive national and international engagement and debate.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Central Lancashire\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Central Lancashire (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Central Lancashire","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007141}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2636910","Name":"Stirling"},{"GeoNamesId":"2147714","Name":"Sydney"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Drawing on this experience, Dooris developed a\u000a      social ecosystem model, conducted an evaluation of UCLan's Healthy\u000a      University programme, and collaborated with WHO to develop settings-based\u000a      theory and formulate a strategic framework for Healthy Universities.\u000a    Phase II (2001-2007) was largely concerned with theory\u000a      development. Drawing on insights from Phase I and synthesising findings\u000a      from wider literature, Dooris formulated a generic conceptual framework\u000a      for healthy settings that identified three characteristics: an ecological\u000a      model of health promotion, a systems perspective and a whole system\u000a      organisational change focus. Additionally, he proposed a number of new\u000a      models to guide healthy settings practice and highlighted three key\u000a      challenges to the evaluation of healthy setting initiatives &#8212; relating to\u000a      the construction of the evidence base for health promotion; the diversity\u000a      of conceptual understandings and real-life practice; and the complexity of\u000a      evaluating ecological whole system approaches. Drawing on complexity\u000a      theory and critical realism, this work was further developed in\u000a      collaboration with colleagues from Canada and other countries. In order to\u000a      test these theoretical developments, Dooris also undertook international\u000a      empirical research with global leaders in healthy settings.\u000a    Phase III (2008-2013) combined regional and national-level\u000a      empirical research with further theory development. A multi-method study\u000a      (&#163;10,000 funded by Higher Education Academy\/ Department of Health)\u000a      conducted by Dooris and Doherty examined Healthy Universities activity in\u000a      English HEIs and explored the potential for a national programme to be\u000a      developed. The findings confirmed that higher education offers significant\u000a      potential to impact positively on the wellbeing of students, staff and\u000a      wider communities; and demonstrated widespread interest in adopting a\u000a      whole system Healthy Universities approach &#8212; reflecting an increasing\u000a      recognition that investment for health within higher education will\u000a      contribute not only to health targets but also to mainstream agendas such\u000a      as staff and student recruitment, experience and retention; and\u000a      institutional and societal productivity and sustainability. The research\u000a      also highlighted support for a National Healthy Higher Education\u000a      Programme. Building on this, Dooris and colleagues were funded by HEFCE to\u000a      conduct a high-profile implementation project (Section 4) and commissioned\u000a      to conduct consultative research leading to a new conceptual model and\u000a      recommendations for the development and operationalization of a National\u000a      Healthy Universities Framework for England (&#163;25,000 funding from\u000a      Department of Health via Royal Society for Public Health). In parallel\u000a      with this, Baybutt and Dooris applied learning from Phases I and II to\u000a      criminal justice settings &#8212; evaluating the Target: Wellbeing Pan-Regional\u000a      Prisons Programme (&#163;756,000 combined implementation and evaluation funding\u000a      from Big Lottery); researching the effectiveness of an Offender Health\u000a      Trainer Service; and examining the benefits of adopting a whole system\u000a      approach to regional tobacco control. Throughout this phase, Dooris and\u000a      colleagues also collaborated to develop new thinking and theory regarding\u000a      the integration of health and sustainability within and across settings.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15174","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The FDAC Evaluation Report (3.5) found that the FDAC model pilot had\u000a      proven positive: parents received improved and swifter access to expert\u000a      assessment and services, provided directly by the unique\u000a      multi-disciplinary team attached to the court (run by Coram and the\u000a      Tavistock NHS Foundation Trust), which is not available in ordinary\u000a      proceedings. As a result of the FDAC team coordinating and linking parents\u000a      with community programmes, FDAC parents received more substance misuse\u000a      community services, more access to parenting programmes and help with\u000a      finances and housing. More FDAC parents stayed in treatment to final order\u000a      and were able to consolidate good progress under the supervision of the\u000a      court to enhance prospects of safe reunification. Health and welfare\u000a      outcomes for parents and children were better in FDAC than in comparison\u000a      cases.

In relation to fathers, 36% of FDAC\u000a      fathers (8 of 23) were no longer misusing substances, but no comparison\u000a      father stopped misusing; FDAC reunification rates were 18% higher (39% v\u000a      21%) and child harm was mitigated in FDAC cases by swifter placement in a\u000a      permanent alternative family when reunification was not possible. All but\u000a      two parents would recommend FDAC to families in similar circumstances and\u000a      they considered that FDAC empowered them, enhanced their motivation and\u000a      participation. A key vehicle was the fortnightly non-lawyer review\u000a      hearings, the therapeutic component of FDAC, in which parents talked\u000a      directly to the judges who also helped motivate, remind parents of their\u000a      responsibilities and address problems. Parents with previous experience of\u000a      ordinary care experiences considered FDAC protected their interests better\u000a      by providing a `fair trial for change', unlike ordinary care proceedings.\u000a      All parents thought FDAC enhanced their rights to demonstrate their\u000a      capacity to change behaviours to safeguard their child's well-being.\u000a      Satisfaction with the process led to fewer contested proceedings than in\u000a      comparison cases and a lower rate of dropout from proceedings.\u000a    Impacts on practitioners and professional services were achieved for\u000a      social workers, lawyers and judges through development of new\u000a      understandings, enhanced inter-professional working and the delivery of\u000a      more integrated practice with clear cost savings for local authorities\u000a      from more children staying within their family, shorter care placements\u000a      (&#163;4000 per child less) and less need for legal representatives in legal\u000a      hearings (saving local authorities &#163;682 per family) and savings on the\u000a      cost of commissioning one-off experts. These costs helped offset the cost\u000a      of the FDAC team (&#163;8740 per family). There were also potential savings for\u000a      courts and legal services. The research changed practice for all\u000a      professionals involved in FDAC care proceedings. Lawyers for parents and\u000a      for the local authority and child, social workers, guardians and judges\u000a      have all worked collaboratively to enhance children's well-being,\u000a      resulting in fewer contested proceedings, thereby also reducing delay and\u000a      extra legal costs. Four pilot judges have demonstrated it is possible to\u000a      adjudicate and play a non-traditional role and developed new knowledge and\u000a      expertise in carrying out this role. One of the pilot judges, District\u000a      Judge Nicholas Crichton (CBE) of the Inner London Family Proceedings\u000a      Court, noted that Harwin's research has been crucial to taking FDAC\u000a      forward, which `seeks to harness the authority of the court in trying to\u000a      achieve change'. [A]\u000a    Judicial continuity, a central feature of FDAC but rare in ordinary\u000a      proceedings, was achieved through promoting organisational efficiency.\u000a      Social workers have become more skilled in presenting evidence to judges,\u000a      an important objective of the Children and Families Bill 2013. The\u000a      co-ordinating role of the FDAC specialist multi-disciplinary team produced\u000a      a more efficient and supportive process. Its dual role as expert,\u000a      treatment provider and monitor of progress is attractive to the Family\u000a      Justice Review because it helps achieve the goal of reducing the number of\u000a      one-off costly expert assessments, increasing efficiency and enhancing\u000a      child and parent outcomes. In recognition of its contribution to\u000a      innovation, FDAC has received 7 national awards.\u000a    The `evaluation' findings have been used by professional bodies and have\u000a      led to impacts on organisations, changing their service delivery, planning\u000a      and management. The London Boroughs of Southwark and Hammersmith and\u000a      Fulham who were both comparison sites in the research have now implemented\u000a      the new model and they are contributing to its funding. The three pilot\u000a      authorities are continuing to fund and utilise the FDAC process.\u000a      Gloucestershire has started an FDAC this year. [B] A new DfE funded FDAC\u000a      Development Programme (2013-2015) aims to promote the development of FDAC\u000a      in different parts of the county. In this way more families will be able\u000a      to access FDAC extending its reach nationally.\u000a    Internationally, a new FDAC will open in January 2014 in Victoria State,\u000a      Australia. Its co-founders, Judge Greg Levine and Professor Barbara\u000a      Kamler consulted with Harwin and colleagues in 2012 on their plans to set\u000a      up and trial the FDAC model in Victoria State. [C] They drew on the\u000a      research findings in their Churchill Fellowship Report to help obtain\u000a      funding from the Victoria government. [D]\u000a    The research findings have helped strengthen the development of evidence\u000a      based practice and have advanced child protection practice. The Centre for\u000a      Excellence and Outcomes in Children and Young People's Services has listed\u000a      FDAC as an example of validated local practice relating to safeguarding,\u000a      families, parents and carers and general resources. [E]\u000a    Impacts on public policy, law and services were achieved through raising\u000a      public and political awareness and legal and policy debate on family\u000a      justice reform. The early promise of the FDAC evaluation contributed to\u000a      the decision of the Family Justice Review in 2011 to recommend further\u000a      roll-out of FDAC. [F, 3.186 Final Recommendations] The Munro Child\u000a      Protection Final Report (2011) includes a case study of the research and\u000a      used it as an example of how multi-disciplinary teams can provide\u000a      effective interventions for vulnerable children [G]\u000a    Drawing on the research findings, the DfE decided to extend funding of\u000a      FDAC for a further year (2011-2012); it commissioned Ernst and Young with\u000a      RyanTunnardBrown (final report Feb 2012) to investigate the business case\u000a      for FDAC (&#163;50,000). Their report drew on the costing data carried out in\u000a      the FDAC evaluation report. The research findings also contributed to the\u000a      decision of the DfE to commission a two-year &#163;300,000 development project\u000a      (2013-2015) to help set up FDAC in different regions, and consider\u000a      extending its remit (H and A). Harwin was invited in 2012 to join a new\u000a      DfE expert working party on `Returning Home from Care' to help develop\u000a      policy and evidence based practice around family reunification.\u000a    Policy debate has been stimulated by FDAC from the outset and continues\u000a      in relation to the Children and Families Bill 2013, which seeks to\u000a      significantly reduce the length of care proceedings in all but exceptional\u000a      cases. FDAC was cited by Mr Justice Ryder, Judge in Charge of the\u000a      Modernisation of Family Justice Programme, as an exemplar of an\u000a      exceptional case `whose success has been clearly established' as a\u000a      `validated and research based option' in the 4th family newsletter update\u000a      of March 2012. The recent House of Lords recent debate: Adoption:\u000a      Post-Legislative Scrutiny (HL Paper 127) also draws on the research\u000a      findings (para 63). [I] It has contributed to a debate about the role of\u000a      care proceedings, family reunification and adoption.\u000a    At international level, the findings of the FDAC evaluation have been\u000a      included in the US National Association of Drug Courts May 2012 update,\u000a      with special mention of the cost findings. [J]\u000a    Following publication of the Final FDAC First Stage Evaluation Report,\u000a      Harwin was interviewed on the \"Today Programme\" (23.05.11), \"Women's Hour\u000a      \"(26.05.11) and BBC Radio London and for the journal Children and Young\u000a      People Now (\"Mothers back family drug court\" (01.06.2011).

She has addressed the\u000a      interface between practice, service delivery, law and policy with\u000a      particular reference to the impact of parental substance misuse on English\u000a      children's services, the courts and child and parental well-being. Her\u000a      research has moved from mapping the problem to evaluating the efficacy of\u000a      new approaches when parental substance misuse is at issue. To this end,\u000a      she has evaluated a new court based approach (Family Drug and Alcohol\u000a      Court model) to assess its potential to improve outcomes for children and\u000a      their parents.\u000a    Professor Harwin and Dr Forrester (Research Fellow) at Brunel University\u000a      (2000-2006) received funding (&#163;75,000) from the Nuffield Foundation to\u000a      survey 4 London local authorities: they reviewed all 290 new referrals\u000a      collected over one year and found that parental substance misuse accounted\u000a      for 62% of all care proceedings and 40% of all child protection\u000a      registrations. 54% of the children of substance misusers were no longer\u000a      with their parents, two years after referral. It was the most frequent\u000a      parental problem (34%) but social workers lacked training and\u000a      inter-professional working was rare. Child outcomes for those who remained\u000a      at home were particularly poor when alcohol misuse persisted, exposing the\u000a      children to domestic violence. The study found a lack of evidence-based\u000a      interventions to successfully tackle parental substance misuse, limited\u000a      social work decision-making processes and complex organisational\u000a      challenges (3.1, 3.2). The troubling findings supported the\u000a      rationale for a new approach to this field of practice.\u000a    A widely used American model with a specialist family drug treatment\u000a      court approach was thought to have potential for UK application in cases\u000a      of parental drug and alcohol misuse where care proceedings were involved.\u000a      The key features absent in ordinary care proceedings were: a specialist\u000a      multidisciplinary team that advises the judge who supports parents and\u000a      coordinates their intervention; a judge who problem-solves and aims to\u000a      motivate parents and frequent hearings without lawyers. The US national\u000a      evaluation study (2007) had shown that outcomes were better when families\u000a      took part in specialist drug and alcohol courts. On the basis of the\u000a      London Authorities' survey, Harwin was invited by Judge Nicholas Crichton\u000a      to join a newly established UK FDAC Steering Group to develop an FDAC in\u000a      England.\u000a    A feasibility study was conducted under the auspices of Brunel and funded\u000a      by the pilot London Local Authorities (&#163;40k). The study found that it was\u000a      possible to adapt the American model to comply with English law and\u000a      practice; the initiative received wide spread support from parents, legal\u000a      practitioners and health care and welfare stakeholders. These findings,\u000a      undertaken with independent consultants Mary Ryan and Claire Chamberlain,\u000a      were reported in 2006-07 (3.3, 3.4). Harwin and the members of the\u000a      steering group presented the study to Government: the Department of\u000a      Health, Department for Education (DfE), the Ministry of Justice, and Home\u000a      Office who subsequently funded the implementation of the first FDAC pilot\u000a      in the UK (&#163;1.5 million 2008-2011, with extended funding for 2011-12).\u000a    In 2007, Harwin obtained research funding (&#163;200k from Nuffield Foundation\u000a    and the Home Office) to evaluate the FDAC pilot. Collaborators were Dr\u000a    Subhash Pokhrel, Mary Ryan and Jo Tunnard (research consultants) and Brunel\u000a    researchers: Dr Sharon Momenian-Schneider (2008), Dr Carla Matias (research\u000a    fellow 2008-10) and Bachar Alrouh (part-time research assistant 2009-2013).\u000a    Findings were reported in the FDAC Evaluation Project Interim Report in\u000a    2009, which showed that it was possible to set up a Family Drug and Alcohol\u000a    Court quickly, to achieve judicial continuity (rarely achieved in ordinary\u000a    care proceedings) and to operate the court at a high level of efficiency.\u000a    The final report of the FDAC Evaluation project confirmed the promise of the\u000a    FDAC model; the study had compared the three pilot site outcomes with two\u000a    comparison site outcomes, which were providing the regular court and\u000a    services (3.5, 3.6). The Nuffield Foundation funded a second stage\u000a    evaluation (&#163;295,393) between 2011 and 2013 to continue and extend the\u000a    comparison of child and parent outcomes at the end of the care proceedings\u000a    and, as a new element, a one-year follow-up comparing the sustainability and\u000a    outcomes of family reunification in FDAC and non-FDAC cases.\u000a    Dissemination has been achieved through policy seminars, presentations to\u000a      Government, media presentations, conferences and invitations to sit on\u000a      related expert committees. The launch of FDAC, publication of the Interim\u000a      and final FDAC Evaluation Reports led to three seminars at the Nuffield\u000a      Foundation, all co-hosted by Brunel. The final seminar, following\u000a      publication of the report, was held in June 2011 and considered options\u000a      for the future of FDAC. Introduced by the then Children's Minister, Tim\u000a      Loughton and the then President of the Family Division, it brought\u000a      together key decision-makers, including David Norgrove (Chair of the\u000a      Family Justice Review), Professor Eileen Munro (author of three Child\u000a      Protection Reviews commissioned by Government) and senior managers from\u000a      local authorities.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15525","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Building on the two-way pathways to impact, Ruhs' team regularly works in\u000a      a co-productive manner with various external partners, and as such their\u000a      research has had significant influence on government policymaking and\u000a      debates relating to migration in the UK, US, and the Netherlands, as well\u000a      as for various UN agencies dealing with migration issues.\u000a    UK policy\u000a    Through Ruhs' team's collaborative work with the UK's Migration\u000a        Advisory Committee (MAC), the research on labour immigration and\u000a      public policy has directly informed and heavily impacted on the MAC's work\u000a      in drawing up a list of \"shortage occupations\" (where employers get easier\u000a      access to migrant workers), which helps regulate labour immigration from\u000a      outside the EU within \"Tier 2\" of the UK's points-based system for\u000a      immigration. To include a job on this list, the MAC needs to agree that\u000a      the job is skilled, that there is a labour shortage and\u000a      that it is `sensible' to respond to the shortage with labour\u000a      immigration. The research for Who needs migrant workers? [R1]\u000a      (initially commissioned by the MAC, thereby involving them in the\u000a      co-productive research process) has developed the framework for addressing\u000a      the `sensible' question in all MAC analysis since 2008 [Section\u000a        5: C1, C2]. All the shortage occupation lists recommended by the MAC\u000a      since 2008 have been accepted by the Government, so there has been a\u000a      direct and clear policy impact of the research (via the analysis and\u000a      policy recommendations of the MAC). According to David Metcalf, Chair of\u000a      the MAC: \"Successive governments have accepted all six shortage occupation\u000a      lists produced by the MAC. This is in large part down to the initial input\u000a      via the Ruhs' research.\" [C1]\u000a    The insight that the UK's growing reliance on migrant workers is closely\u000a      related to a wide range of public policies that have encouraged employers\u000a      to recruit migrants over British workers [R1; C11], has had an\u000a      important impact on the development of a new approach to immigration by\u000a      the Labour Party [C3]. Ed Miliband's first major speech on\u000a      immigration [C4], given in June 2012, drew directly from the\u000a      research. After a 45 minute discussion of the book with Ruhs in a private\u000a      meeting in early June 2012, Miliband argued in his speech a few days later\u000a      that there was a need for \"a new approach to immigration based on building\u000a      a different kind of economy.\" Miliband's Special Advisor commented: `Mr\u000a      Miliband's speech subsequently drew directly on the analysis in that book\u000a      and Mr Miliband has continued to make arguments that build from those\u000a      central insights i.e. that in order to reduce low skilled immigration we\u000a      need to build a different type of economy, with better training,\u000a      enforcement of labour standards and more effective regulation of\u000a      recruitment agencies, including his last two conference speeches [...] In\u000a      a world in which the divide between academia and policy can often be very\u000a      wide, Martin is one of those whose work bridges the gap.' [C3; R1].\u000a    The research on employer demand for migrant labour also impacted on media\u000a        and public policy debates in the UK. Ruhs and Anderson produced a\u000a      policy primer based on the book [C11], and published on the\u000a      publicly accessible website of Oxford University's Migration Observatory\u000a      (over 3,000 unique hits since mid 2011). The primer was cited in the\u000a      Financial Times and discussed in an interview with Mark Easton on the BBC\u000a      6:00 p.m. primetime news. Ruhs and Anderson also published an opinion\u000a      piece in the print version of the Guardian.\u000a    Policy beyond the UK:\u000a    Outside the UK, the research has had considerable impact on debates\u000a        and legislation on immigration reform in the US [C5, C6]. Who\u000a        Needs Migrant Workers? [R1] was launched at the Economic\u000a      Policy Institute, a major think-tank linked to trade unions, in Washington\u000a      DC in late 2010. Martin and Ruhs drew on the book for an article on the\u000a      role of independent commissions in US immigration reform [R3]\u000a      which was discussed in meetings with officials at the Department of Labor,\u000a      the Department for Homeland Security, and with staffers working for the\u000a      Senate Judiciary Committee. In early 2013, Ruhs and Martin's research on\u000a      independent commissions in labour immigration policy [R3] was\u000a      discussed at a hearing on comprehensive immigration reform by the Senate\u000a      Judiciary Committee, and in an op-ed in the Financial Times [C10].\u000a      In April 2013, a group of eight Senators published a major bipartisan bill\u000a      for comprehensive immigration reform [C6]. The bill proposes the\u000a      establishment of a \"Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research\" which\u000a      recommends the annual quota for a new work visa programme (W-Visa), and\u000a      identifies shortage occupations based on analysis of the issues discussed\u000a      in the research [R3]. The bill passed the Senate in May 2013, and\u000a      Congress is expected to vote on it in the autumn of 2013. If it passes, it\u000a      will lead to the biggest reform of US immigration policy since the 1980s.\u000a      Ray Marshall, U.S. Secretary of Labor, 1977-1981, has played a central\u000a      role in policy debates about new immigration legislation in the US. He\u000a      says that the research [R1] has \"helped us enormously in gaining\u000a      broad political support for the Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market\u000a      Research that was included in the US Senate's 2013 comprehensive\u000a      immigration reform bill. The Senate version needs revision to make it more\u000a      independent, but Martin's work will help us with these refinements.\" [C5]\u000a    The research has also informed key individuals working on labour and\u000a        immigration across Europe. In the Netherlands, a summary of [R1]\u000a      was translated into Dutch for a book chapter published by the Dutch\u000a      Scientific Council for Government Policy [C7] and discussed with\u000a      the Minister of Social Affairs and Employment who used the research,\u000a      especially Ruhs' insight that immigration is linked to a wide range of\u000a      public policies, to formulate the official Dutch cabinet's view on\u000a        labour migration [C7]. According to a senior member of the\u000a      scientific staff of the Scientific Council for Government Policy, \"the\u000a      impact of Ruhs' work has been substantial [...] the Council used Ruhs'\u000a      contribution, based on the Who need migrant workers book [R1],\u000a      to draft a number of policy recommendations concerning the future of\u000a      labour migration in the European Union [...] in our opinion, Ruhs\u000a      convincingly argues that labour migration should be regarded in the wider\u000a      context of labour market policies and the structure of the Dutch labour\u000a      market.\" [C7]\u000a    The research for The Price of Rights book [R2], which\u000a      analysed the tension between openness to admitting migrant workers and\u000a      migrant rights after admission, had a major impact on policy debates at\u000a      various UN agencies and international organisations, including the\u000a      International Labour Organisation, the United Nations High Commissioner\u000a      for Human Rights, the United Nations Development Programme, and the\u000a      International Organisation for Migration (IOM) [C8]. Specifically\u000a      at the IOM, the Director of Policy Research stated that: \"Ruhs' research\u000a      [...] has encouraged more explicit debate among international agencies\u000a      about the potential tensions between access and rights in labour\u000a      immigration policy, and about the pros and cons of a core rights approach\u000a      to the global protection of migrant workers\". [C8]\u000a    Ruhs presented the research at all these agencies and held a series of\u000a      discussions with officials during 2009-13. The UNDP's Human\u000a        Development Report 2009 was dedicated to migration, and included an\u000a      extensive discussion of the idea of a trade-off between openness and\u000a      rights in labour immigration policy. The research [R2] also\u000a      informed the European Development Report 2013 for which Ruhs wrote\u000a      a background paper discussing the role of migration and migrant rights in\u000a      the post-MDG (Millennium Development Goals) international development\u000a      agenda.

The key\u000a      researchers involved are:\u000a    \u000a      Martin Ruhs (University Lecturer in Political Economy; Research\u000a        Associate, Department for Social Policy and Intervention; and Senior\u000a        Researcher, Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS), Oxford\u000a        University);\u000a      Bridget Anderson (Professor of Migration and Citizenship, Centre on\u000a        Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS), Oxford University); and\u000a      Philip Martin (Professor of Economics, UC Davis), who authored a book\u000a        chapter and co- authored a journal article with Martin Ruhs.\u000a    \u000a    Labour immigration and public policy: Labour immigration is often\u000a      viewed as a discrete area of policy, and the relationships between\u000a      immigration, labour demand and other public policy areas typically remain\u000a      unrecognised in public debates and policymaking. The multi-disciplinary\u000a      research for Who Needs Migrant Workers? [Section 3: R1]\u000a      analyses the role of migrant workers in six different sectors of the UK\u000a      economy, and includes a comparative discussion with the US [also\u000a      see R3]. The research shows how labour immigration and employer\u000a      demand for migrant workers are closely related to a wide range of\u000a      institutions and public policies that go beyond immigration policy. Labour\u000a      market policies, housing policies, and a wide range of social policies,\u000a      have in many countries created incentives for employers, especially in\u000a      low-waged sectors, to develop a preference for recruiting migrant over\u000a      domestic workers. Reducing or at least slowing down the growth in the\u000a      reliance on migrant labour &#8212; a policy goal of many governments &#8212; will not\u000a      happen without fundamental changes to the policies and institutions that\u000a      create the demand in the first place. In the UK, the research recommends\u000a      that this includes greater labour market regulation in some sectors, more\u000a      investment in education and training, better wages and conditions in some\u000a      low waged public sector jobs, improved job status and career tracks, and\u000a      better regulation of employment agencies [R1].\u000a    Openness vs Rights: Many low-income countries and development\u000a      organisations, such as the World Bank, are calling for greater\u000a      liberalisation of labour immigration policies in high-income countries. At\u000a      the same time, many human rights organisations and migrant rights\u000a      advocates, such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO) demand more\u000a      equality of rights for migrant workers. The international comparative\u000a      research for The Price of Rights [R2] shows that it is not\u000a      always possible to have both. Examining labour immigration policies in\u000a      over forty countries, as well as policy drivers in major migrant-receiving\u000a      and migrant-sending states, the research shows that high- income\u000a      countries' labour immigration policies are characterised by a trade-off\u000a      between openness to admitting migrant workers, and some of the rights\u000a      granted to migrants after admission. More open admission policies are\u000a      associated with greater restrictions of migrant rights (especially, but\u000a      not only, social rights giving access to the welfare state) [also\u000a      see R4]. This implies that insisting on equality of rights for\u000a      migrant workers can come at the price of discouraging the liberalisation\u000a      of international labour migration, especially for lower-skilled workers\u000a      whose international movement is currently most restricted. How to respond\u000a      to the openness-rights trade-off is one of the most important questions\u000a      for global and national debates about international labour migration [R1,\u000a        R5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15526","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Gardner's team's research on parenting interventions has had significant\u000a      impact on central policy\u000a      relating to parenting and child behaviour both within the UK and beyond.\u000a    Impact 1- UK policy\u000a    Persistent antisocial behaviour in children is a major social\u000a      issue. The public costs, incurred by\u000a      multiple systems, are estimated at &#163;250,000 per child by age 27 (Sainsbury\u000a      Centre for Mental\u000a      Health, 2009). Thus the case for needing to implement interventions that\u000a      can reduce these\u000a      problems is very compelling. A decade ago, very little UK policy on\u000a      parenting interventions was\u000a      based on rigorous empirical evidence. Policy shifted in the late 2000s,\u000a      with spending targeted\u000a      increasingly on parenting interventions that had been found by Gardner's\u000a      team (among others) to\u000a      be effective for improving child outcomes in randomised trials [R1,\u000a        R3]. Gardner made substantial\u000a      contributions (authoring three chapters) to an influential government\u000a      report `Support from the Start'\u000a      (2004), which cites early findings from her Oxford trial [R1],\u000a      and which was highly significant to this\u000a      debate, and to driving subsequent policy shifts [C2, C3].\u000a    Drawing on these UK trials, Gardner was then invited in 2006 to be a\u000a      member of the expert\u000a      advisory panel for heath-led parenting interventions for the Prime\u000a      Minister's Strategy Unit. This\u000a      panel helped to devise the strategy, piloting, implementation, and testing\u000a      of a national rollout of an\u000a      evidence-based home-visiting programme for vulnerable families, which\u000a      began in 2009 [C2].\u000a      Gardner's team's UK research was also a key contributor to bringing about\u000a      the introduction of the\u000a      National Academy of Parenting Practitioners (NAPP) in November 2007. NAPP\u000a      aimed to\u000a      `transform the quality and size of the parenting workforce', in order to\u000a      improve parenting and\u000a      children's well-being, by training large cohorts of staff in\u000a      evidence-based parenting interventions,\u000a      particularly those tested in Gardner's UK trials [C2, C3]. As\u000a      explained by the then Deputy Director\u000a      of the Social Exclusion Task Force at the Cabinet Office [C2], who\u000a      played a major part in driving\u000a      New Labour policies on early parenting interventions in the late 2000's: \"Support\u000a        from the Start\"\u000a        and Gardner's UK trials [R1-3] were highly\u000a        influential in creating momentum towards these major\u000a        policy developments, including the very substantial roll out led by the\u000a        National Academy of\u000a        Parenting Practitioners (NAPP) from 2008.\u000a    The founder and research director of NAPP [C3] adds to this:\u000a        Gardner's research was pivotal in\u000a        helping persuade the Cabinet Office to set up NAPP. Her trial [R1]\u000a        was the first in the world to\u000a        show that parenting programmes could be effective in reducing severe\u000a        antisocial behaviour,\u000a        outside the narrow confines of child mental health services, showing\u000a        that the voluntary sector could\u000a        do just as good a job with difficult cases. Influenced by these\u000a        findings, the government awarded\u000a        &#163;35 million to NAPP to disseminate evidence-based parenting programmes\u000a        across the voluntary\u000a        sector; this is estimated to have benefited over 150,000 children;\u000a        Gardner was an important\u000a        member of its steering group to ensure this research was implemented.\u000a    Prominent commentators on family policy also attribute this policy shift\u000a      to Gardner's trials: Jane\u000a      Lewis (2011), in a recent article sees these trials as the key research\u000a      driver of this policy shift:\u000a      \"Second, a small number of evaluations of ... EBPPs (evidence-based\u000a        parenting programmes)\u000a        have been undertaken in England using RCTs, ... obtaining positive\u000a        results for disadvantaged as\u000a        well as more advantaged families...[Scott 2001, Gardner et al. 2006,\u000a        2010, Hutchings et al. 2007]\u000a      [R1-3]. These have played a part in influencing central\u000a        government policy to ...provide financial\u000a        incentives for LAs to adopt this type of programme rather than untested\u000a        home-grown variants\".\u000a    Gardner's team's research is frequently cited in influential systematic\u000a      reviews, guidelines, and\u000a      policy documents [see C4-7 for Cochrane, Campbell and other\u000a      reviews]. For example, four of the\u000a      trials [R1-6] have been cited in the NICE Guidelines (National\u000a      Institute of Health and Clinical\u000a      Excellence); the Chair confirms their policy influence [C3]: As\u000a        Chair of the NICE Guideline on\u000a        antisocial behaviour and conduct disorders, I oversaw the marshalling of\u000a        the evidence which has to\u000a        be relevant to British practice, and Gardner's work was important in\u000a        shaping the recommendations,\u000a        since it showed that the interventions work in Britain &#8212; not all\u000a        psychosocial interventions developed\u000a        in the USA do this. Their work also added to the plausibility of the\u000a        recommendations since it\u000a        demonstrated that the mediating mechanism was an increase in positive\u000a        parenting.\u000a    In this way, Gardner's research [R1-7] has contributed to\u000a      substantial policy change and\u000a      investment in parenting interventions, across multiple sectors, including\u000a      health, social care and the\u000a      voluntary sector, in the UK and across the world.\u000a    Impact 2: International Policy\u000a    As stated by the Head of Research and Development, Swedish National Board\u000a      of Health &amp;\u000a      Welfare [C1]: Gardner's research influenced parenting\u000a        interventions in Europe; they showed that\u000a        US parenting interventions could be transferable to European health and\u000a        social systems, and\u000a        contributed to a shift in practice and policy in multiple countries. Her\u000a        recent innovative research on\u000a        cross-country transportability has stimulated a good deal of policy\u000a        debate and further government\u000a        research on cross-country adaptation in Sweden. Since then, many\u000a      countries have implemented\u000a      and tested these programmes, and cite the Oxford research in numerous\u000a      reports on parenting\u000a      trials (e.g. from Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Holland, Portugal [C1]).\u000a      In many of these countries,\u000a      evaluators have closely followed the questions and methods Gardner used to\u000a      test mechanisms of\u000a      change and subgroup effects in her trials. Gardner has also been\u000a      invited to participate in policy\u000a      deliberations regarding the introduction of parenting programmes\u000a      internationally. For example:\u000a    \u000a      New Zealand (2011): Gardner presented the research to 300\u000a        practitioners and policymakers at\u000a        the Werry Centre, responsible for nationwide rollout, and in 2012 as\u000a        Rotary Scholar, presented to\u000a        the NZ Royal College of Psychiatrists. The head of national workforce\u000a        development [C9] states\u000a        that: Gardner's UK trials [R1-3] have been\u000a          influential in determining national policy, as they\u000a          demonstrated that US interventions could be effective in social care\u000a          systems that are more\u000a          similar to New Zealand's, and that they could work in non- specialised\u000a          community services in the\u000a          NGO sector. Over 1500 practitioners have now been trained in the\u000a          programme Gardner tested.\u000a      Slovenia (2013): Gardner presented findings to the national\u000a        professional body for Child\u000a        Psychiatrists and Psychologists, appearing on Radio Slovenia, which led\u000a        to further policy\u000a        discussions with the Ministry of Health, and initiation of several\u000a        projects to implement evidence-\u000a        based parenting programmes in schools and clinics.\u000a      Estonia (2011): Gardner presented findings to the Head of the\u000a        Government Department of\u000a        Children and Families, and other policymakers and practitioners.\u000a        Research presented on her UK\u000a        trials [R1-3] at this visit contributed to a debate and a shift\u000a        in Estonian policy toward adopting the\u000a        parenting programme Gardner had tested, rather than others.\u000a      Malta (2012): Gardner was invited to Parliament to discuss\u000a        evidence-based parenting\u000a        programmes with the (then Shadow) Minister for Social Policy and\u000a        Spokesperson for the Family.\u000a        Following this, the new Minister for the Family has initiated policy\u000a        guidance on Positive Parenting.\u000a    \u000a    Gardner's research has also had direct influence on international\u000a      organisations such as\u000a      UNODC [C6], and WHO [C7, C10]. As the WHO Violence\u000a      Prevention Initiative, Technical Officer,\u000a      explains: Gardner's research has had a very significant impact on\u000a        policy and practice in high,\u000a        middle and low income countries. Indeed her research has been central to\u000a        a shift that has occurred\u000a        within WHO's Violence Prevention Unit, whereby parenting interventions\u000a        have been selected as\u000a        the first of four priority violence prevention strategy we plan to scale\u000a        up in coming years. Her\u000a      research team are working directly with the WHO to develop, test, and\u000a      scale up parenting\u000a      programmes for developing world settings in South Africa, with future\u000a      randomised trials planned in\u000a      countries such as Brazil, the Philippines, and Ghana [C10].\u000a    In the USA, Gardner's parenting intervention research has led directly to\u000a      her appointment to the\u000a      Board of `Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development' [C8], a\u000a      longstanding US violence prevention\u000a      organisation, until recently funded by the US government Office of\u000a      Juvenile Justice and\u000a      Delinquency Prevention. Its role is to review and make decisions about\u000a      which programmes qualify\u000a      for the influential Blueprints `best practice' list, widely used by US\u000a      policymakers and practitioners.\u000a      Her Oxford trial is cited and used by many other influential US\u000a      policy-making and policy-informing\u000a      bodies (2006-12): Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\u000a      Administration's (SAMHSA)\u000a      National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs &amp; Practices; RAND's\u000a      Promising Program Network;\u000a      Partnership for America's Economic Success; Washington State Institute for\u000a      Public Policy; and the\u000a      Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy. Gardner's research therefore has\u000a      clearly had significant\u000a      impact on parenting and child behaviour policy in the UK and beyond.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Frances Gardner and her team in Oxford have been studying antisocial\u000a      behaviour in children for\u000a      two decades. This programme of research has been instrumental in\u000a      demonstrating that parenting\u000a      programmes are effective in significantly reducing antisocial behaviour,\u000a      thus encouraging uptake of\u000a      these programmes by bodies that play a major role in forming UK central\u000a      government policy\u000a      relating to parenting and child behaviour, such as NICE and the (then)\u000a      Department of Children,\u000a      Schools and Families (DCSF). Given that lifetime costs of antisocial\u000a      behaviour are so high, these\u000a      interventions are likely to produce high return on investment, with\u000a      cost-benefit analyses (e.g. NICE;\u000a      DCSF) suggesting that over &#163;200,000 per child could be saved.

Importantly these\u000a      effects on parent and child behaviour were found using multiple methods.\u000a      Mediation analyses\u000a      tested the theory of change underlying the programme &#8212; namely that change\u000a      in positive parenting\u000a      skill, rather than in parent confidence or well-being, is a key driver of\u000a      change in child behaviour.\u000a    A second randomised trial, conducted collaboratively with Professor Judy\u000a      Hutchings (PI)\u000a      (Bangor University), (2002-07) funded by the Health Foundation, replicated\u000a      these outcomes and\u000a      mechanisms of change, in a larger, multi-agency study within North Wales\u000a      `Sure Start' services\u000a      [R2, R3]. Work within this study, led by Gardner, found that,\u000a      contrary to expectations based on\u000a      previous research and practice, there was no evidence for greater effects\u000a      on more advantaged\u000a      families [R3]. Moreover, Gardner found better outcomes for mothers\u000a      who were more depressed or\u000a      who had higher levels of parenting stress [R3]. These are vital\u000a      messages for policymakers and\u000a      practitioners, often sceptical about whether these programmes can reach\u000a      the most troubled\u000a      families (Section 4). This research is significant in being one of the\u000a      first to use an experimental\u000a      design to test further the mediating role [R2, R3, R6] of\u000a      parenting influences identified in Gardner's\u000a      earlier Oxford longitudinal studies (Gardner et al., 1999, 2003, Wellcome\u000a      Trust funded, 1996-99).\u000a    Drawing on those early longitudinal studies to design new intervention\u000a      strategies, the Oxford\u000a      team replicated these findings on mechanisms of change and subgroup\u000a      effects [R4-6] in a family\u000a      intervention tested in two randomised trials in a nationwide child welfare\u000a      service in the US.

They\u000a      carried out the US fieldwork, which was analysed [R4, R6] by the\u000a      Oxford team.\u000a    Finally, in 2010, the Oxford team were commissioned by the Sexual\u000a      Violence Research\u000a      Initiative (SVRI) and MRC South Africa to conduct the first ever\u000a      systematic review of parenting\u000a      programmes in low and middle income countries (LMIC), for reducing harsh\u000a      and abusive parenting\u000a      (2010-12) [R7]. Extensive searching found 12 randomised trials of\u000a      parenting interventions in\u000a      LMICs.

The team made a number of recommendations for further research\u000a      and practice\u000a      based on these findings. Despite its recency, this review has had\u000a      considerable impact (see section\u000a      4), and has led to further funding for Gardner's team from the Swedish\u000a      government's National\u000a      Board of Health and Welfare [C1], for a systematic review of\u000a      factors affecting the transferability of\u000a      parenting interventions across countries and cultures.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15863","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In his 2007 book Thomas revealed for the first time the extent to which\u000a      the Police National Computer (PNC) which holds the national collection of\u000a      criminal records was being accessed by non-police organisations (Thomas\u000a      2007). The PNC had traditionally held criminal records for the police and\u000a      the courts and no one else. The police had, however, in conditions of some\u000a      secrecy, been quietly allowing other organisations to have direct and\u000a      continuing access to the PNC. Thomas was able to demonstrate that some 38\u000a      non-police organisations (and possibly more) had been allowed to have\u000a      access by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) little known\u000a      sub- committee known as the Police Information Access Panel (PIAP).\u000a    This spreading use of criminal records beyond the police and the courts\u000a      had taken place purely on the basis of police decisions and with no\u000a      democratic oversight. There was even a policy called `Phoenix Links' to\u000a      spread the practice; `Phoenix' was the name of the PNC application that\u000a      held records. When the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution\u000a      in 2008 began its investigation Surveillance: Citizens and the State\u000a      Thomas brought the work of the PIAP to the attention of the Committee. His\u000a      Memorandum on the subject was re-produced in the Committees final report\u000a      (House of Lords 2009:437-438).\u000a    The Coalition government in May 2010 announced its intention to review\u000a      the whole of the criminal record regime and the use of criminal records\u000a      for employment screening. An independent advisor (Sunita Mason) had\u000a      oversight of these reviews which reported in two phases in February and\u000a      December 2011 (Home Office 2011 a and b).\u000a    Thomas was invited to the Home Office to take part in Phase 2. He spent\u000a      two hours at the Home Office in London on 15th December 2011 discussing\u000a      all aspects of the criminal record regime with staff of the Public\u000a      Protection Information Team. He also provided them with a written paper\u000a      (`Response to the Home Office on their Criminal Records Review' (15\u000a      December 2010) (15pp) (his contribution was acknowledged in the second\u000a      phase report (Home Office 2011b: p69)). Following this visit he was\u000a      invited to further discussions at a visit to the ACPO Criminal Record\u000a      Office (ACRO) in Hampshire (1 September 2011).\u000a    The significance of PIAP and the PNC access to non-police organisations\u000a      was noted in the Sunita Mason's final report:\u000a    \"I believe further consideration could be given to [PIAP] membership,\u000a      which needs to be sufficiently broad to reflect legitimate interests\u000a      across government and the importance to the public at large of who has\u000a      access to criminal records data...\"\u000a    This complex landscape needs to be rationalised so that there is a clear\u000a      national perspective on who has access to criminal records and for what\u000a      purposes. In my view, access should never be granted for purely commercial\u000a      reasons and such requests should be automatically barred. (ibid: p35)\u000a    and recommendation 7 of the report said that:\u000a    (i) Access to criminal records via the Police National Computer should\u000a      only be granted where it is necessary for public protection or criminal\u000a      justice purposes.\u000a    (ii) All such access should be agreed by the Police Information Access\u000a      Panel (PIAP), based on appropriate business cases and supply agreements.\u000a    (iii) All existing supply arrangements should be reviewed within the next\u000a      12 months to check they conform to the standards set by PIAP (ibid)\u000a    and the secrecy of the decision making was held to be not in the public\u000a      interest:\u000a    The handling of criminal records is a legitimate matter of public\u000a      concern. Any citizen should have straightforward access to clear\u000a      information about what these records consist of, how they are handled and\u000a      how they might impinge on their lives. This is as much an issue for\u000a      victims of crime as for those who commit them (ibid p41).\u000a    The Sex Offender Register\u000a    Thomas made an impact on policy re. the sex offender register by\u000a      assisting solicitors and lawyers in a case at the UK Supreme Court against\u000a      the Home Office. He was approached by Pete Weatherby of the law firm Irwin\u000a      Mitchell who had taken up the case of two people who challenged the sex\u000a      offender laws that said life-time registration could never be appealed\u000a      against. Thomas provided them with background material that enabled them\u000a      to win the case (including telephone advice during the Supreme Court\u000a      hearing) and which required the government to introduce new laws to\u000a      maintain compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights (R on\u000a      the application of F and Angus Aubrey Thompson (Respondents) v. Secretary\u000a      of State for the Home Department (Appellant) [2010] UKSC 17).\u000a    The resulting new laws were in the form of a Statutory Instrument called\u000a      the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Remedial) Order 2012 no 1883 which amended\u000a      the Sexual Offences Act 2003 by introducing new sections 91A-F. In future\u000a      all life-time registrants would have a right of appeal and some 43 (of 91\u000a      applicants) have now been taken off the register (see Daily Mail 6 May\u000a      2013 using the Freedom of Information Act\u000a      http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-2320483\/Child-rapists-\u000a      taken-Sex-Offenders-Register-secret--police-say-protect-human-rights.html\u000a      &#8212; accessed 19 July 2013; see also Thomas 2009, Thomas and Thompson 2012).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Thomas has undertaken a substantial body of work relating to\u000a      government (Home Office and Ministry of Justice) offender information\u000a      systems.

Professor Frost has engaged at\u000a      all these organisational levels on a regional, national and international\u000a      basis.

As a result\u000d\u000a      of this, HM Prison Service &#8212; and in particular individual prison governors\u000d\u000a      &#8212; became wary of inviting\u000d\u000a      external arts organisations to work in their prisons. Consequently, the\u000d\u000a      Arts Alliance (hereafter `AA' &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      national body for promoting arts in the Criminal Justice System) launched\u000d\u000a      a campaign against PSI-50,\u000d\u000a      using, amongst other evidence, CACs research on the Arts to demonstrate\u000d\u000a      their value. The Manager of\u000d\u000a      the AA has stated with reference to CAC's research, \"The provision of\u000d\u000a        robust evidence for the benefit of\u000d\u000a        the Arts Alliance in demonstrating the impact of arts programmes in the\u000d\u000a        rehabilitation of offenders is\u000d\u000a        useful in making our case when trying to influence the wider policy\u000d\u000a        debate. We hold regular meetings\u000d\u000a        with key policy makers at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the National\u000d\u000a        Offender Management Services\u000d\u000a        (NOMS), where such evidence is crucial\". In addition, the Manager of\u000d\u000a      the AA has further stated, \"The\u000d\u000a        report co-authored by Dr Laura Caulfield and David Wilson about Good\u000d\u000a        Vibrations music project:\u000d\u000a        Continuing Positive Change in Prison and Community (2010), is quoted in\u000d\u000a        a paper, which will be taken\u000d\u000a        to the `Beyond Employability' Round Table event hosted by Prisoner\u000d\u000a        Education Trust on 26th June\u000d\u000a        (2013). Having robust evidence such as this is the key to enabling arts\u000d\u000a        interventions to continue in\u000d\u000a        criminal justice settings and communities and is hugely valuable to our\u000d\u000a        membership\". In 2010 the then\u000d\u000a      Justice Minister Crispin Blunt, in rescinding PSI-50, stated `We recognise\u000d\u000a      that Arts activities can play a\u000d\u000a      valuable role in helping offenders to address issues such as communication\u000d\u000a      problems and low self-esteem\u000d\u000a      and enabling them to engage in programmes that address their offending\u000d\u000a      behaviour'.\u000d\u000a    CAC has continued to generate impact through the AA in providing evidence\u000d\u000a      of improved\u000d\u000a      offender outcomes. The AA Evidence Directory &#8212; an online repository of\u000d\u000a      research and evaluation,\u000d\u000a      includes CAC projects.

For example, Caulfield was invited to present\u000d\u000a      findings relating to a 2008\u000d\u000a      evaluation of Gamelan music projects (Funded by the Firebird Trust) at the\u000d\u000a      AA launch conferences in\u000d\u000a      2009 and a subsequent AA conference in 2010, which attracted an audience\u000d\u000a      of government and prison\u000d\u000a      service officials, as well as Arts practitioners and others.\u000d\u000a    In 2011 the research was identified in Research Councils UK Big Ideas\u000d\u000a        for the Future report, a\u000d\u000a      publicly available document outlining 100 examples of excellent research\u000d\u000a      from all fields including\u000d\u000a      science, engineering, social sciences, medicine and the arts and\u000d\u000a      humanities.

The\u000d\u000a      Chair of the MLVM Charitable\u000d\u000a      Trust has stated, \"The evaluation demonstrated the impact of the artist\u000d\u000a        in residence programme to date.\u000d\u000a        This in turn was the basis for the MLVM Charitable Trust's decision to\u000d\u000a        fund the programme for a further\u000d\u000a        two year phase\".

The research cited has both reach and\u000a      significance and can be demonstrated in a number of ways for the different\u000a      audiences who have used the research:\u000a    Dr Caulfield's 2011 evaluation of the Artist in Residence, commissioned\u000a      by the Marie-Louise von Motesiczky (MLVM) Charitable Trust, resulted in\u000a      the residency being extended for a further two years (2012 and 2013),\u000a      demonstrating effects on and benefits to practice within the prison and\u000a      benefits to opportunities available to Grendon prisoners. The recreational\u000a      art group built around the Artist in Residence currently has places for 15\u000a      prisoners and resulted in 107 entries being made to the Koestler Trust\u000a      Exhibition in 2013 &#8212; the highest number of entries from the prison in its\u000a      history. Of note, the work of the artist and the prisoners with whom she\u000a      worked will be exhibited at the offices of the Guardian in March 2014. The\u000a      Chair of the MLVM Charitable Trust stated, \"The evaluation demonstrated\u000a        the impact of the artist in residence programme to date. This is turn\u000a        was the basis for the MLVM Charitable Trust's decision to fund the\u000a        programme for a further two-year phase\".\u000a    CAC research with BME prisoners has resulted in the prison improving its\u000a      cultural sensitivity when applying core values of decency, respect,\u000a      equality and diversity. The research was presented as evidence during an\u000a      inspection of the prison, is cited in the publicly available inspection\u000a      report (HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, 2011) and as such, is indicative of\u000a      the wider reach of the research. The proportion of BME prisoners at HMP\u000a      Grendon has increased as a result of the research. This evidences effects\u000a      on, changes to and benefits to policy and practice within and beyond\u000a      Grendon, effects on, awareness and understanding of group-specific needs\u000a      and reduction or prevention of harm \/ negative effects upon staff and\u000a      prisoners. Evidence of this impact is provided in the testimony of the\u000a      Governor of HMP Grendon and Springhill, who stated that the research \"was\u000a        part of our project to better understand the experience of BME people\u000a        before and during treatment at Grendon. This helped to revise our recruitment\u000a        processes and the internal environment. The BME population has now\u000a        increased to 27%\". It is further stated, \"This research was an\u000a        important element in a wider programme of engaging with diversity of\u000a        race and ethnicity. Historically BME people have been under-represented\u000a        in treatment services and this had been the experience at Grendon (16%\u000a        compared to 25% of the prison population as a whole)\". In addition,\u000a      the publicly available inspection report (HM Chief Inspector of Prisons,\u000a      2011, p. 18) notes the contribution of the research to achieving key\u000a      performance indicators, \"2.28. The race impact assessment on\u000a          treatment delivery and other relevant assessments should be informed\u000a        by consultation with black and minority ethnic prisoners.

Equality impact assessments demonstrated some\u000a        good quality consultation with black and minority ethnic prisoners.\u000a        Birmingham City University had been commissioned to undertake a\u000a        consultation with black and minority ethnic prisoners about the\u000a        therapeutic regime and the results were being applied in a review of\u000a        these prisoners' experience of the therapeutic regime. The report of the\u000a        consultation had been made available to prisoners on the residential\u000a        units and a series of meetings planned to discuss the findings and agree\u000a        actions to improve the situation\".\u000a    Professor Wilson is the Chair of the Howard League for Penal Reform's\u000a      Policy Committee and in this capacity, Chaired the Commission on English\u000a      Prisons in 2009. Professor Wilson's research was among that cited in the\u000a      publicly available report of the Commission, entitled Do Better; Do\u000a        Less: The Report of the Commission on English Prisons Today. The\u000a      research undertaken by Professor Wilson at HMP Grendon played a\u000a      significant role in his selection as Chair of the Commission. This\u000a      demonstrates impact in terms of effects on awareness and understanding of\u000a      public and policy audiences regarding contemporary issues in the CJS. The\u000a      Chief Executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform stated, \"David\u000a        Wilson's invitation to Chair the Commission came about through his\u000a        reputation as a leading criminologist in his field, having been a\u000a        high-profile prison governor and based on the research that he had\u000a        undertaken into the therapeutic community at HMP Grendon. David led\u000a        discussions with ministers, officials, NGOs and the media on publication\u000a        of the report so that the findings influenced UK government policy\u000a        embedding concepts of justice reinvestment, penal moderation and\u000a        restorative justice. The Coalition Government championed restorative\u000a        justice and ministers introduced justice reinvestment pilots,\u000a        particularly for youth justice, into local authorities across the\u000a        country\".\u000a    HMP Grendon and CAC remain committed to an annual debate between the\u000a      prison and final year students at BCU, evidencing benefits to the\u000a      opportunities available to HMP Grendon prisoners. Around 40-50 prisoners\u000a      participate in the debate each year.\u000a    Insights into the offending behaviours of the prisoner groups specified\u000a      above has resulted in West Midlands Police commissioning CAC to jointly\u000a      host four training seminars at the University between 2010 and 2012 to\u000a      better train Senior Investigating Officers during murder investigations.\u000a      Therefore, CAC's underpinning research around understanding and responding\u000a      to diverse offenders demonstrates effects on practice in policing and\u000a      criminal investigation.\u000a    Evidence of impact is also demonstrated in terms of the continuous and\u000a      extensive media presence of the work of CAC members, demonstrating\u000a      benefits in terms of awareness of penal issues amongst audiences. `Reach'\u000a      is considerable as reporting has taken place locally, nationally and\u000a      internationally. Professor Wilson is frequently quoted in mainstream media\u000a      items about HMP Grendon (see for example McClatchey, 2011). Items relating\u000a      to CAC's expertise in `understanding and responding to diverse prisoners'\u000a      has been widely disseminated through these media, particularly relating to\u000a      sex offending, murder and serial killing. These latter three themes are\u000a      underpinned by knowledge directly developed through the Grendon\u000a      relationship. `Significance' can also be evidenced here in that Professor\u000a      Wilson has been identified in published, peer reviewed research\u000a      (Groombridge, 2007) and the higher education press (Corbyn, 2009) as a\u000a      leading, frequently quoted criminologist in the media.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The case study refers to research conducted by the Centre for Applied\u000a      Criminology (CAC), which has focused on HMP Grendon.

This prison wholly operates as a therapeutic community &#8212; a unique\u000a      facility for prisoners who have demonstrated a genuine desire to change.\u000a      Prisoners must be serving sentences that allow for a stay of at least 24\u000a      months at HMP Grendon and during their time there, they engage in\u000a      group-based therapy underpinned by collaborative, democratic, humane and\u000a      participative principles.\u000a    The research developed from 1997, building upon the initial work of\u000a      Professor Wilson, who was able to draw upon his access to the long-term\u000a      prisoners to launch a successful programme of enquiry and which has\u000a      resulted in his Chairing the charity The Grendon Friends Trust &#8212; the first\u000a      and only charity in the UK to support an individual prison. CAC's\u000a      partnership with the prison was formalised in 2009 through a Memorandum of\u000a      Understanding (MoU). The subsequent research has been strongly needs-led\u000a      and strategically informed by a commitment to `application', both within\u000a      and beyond the Grendon community. A portfolio of HMP Grendon-based\u000a      research has evolved around a central theme of `understanding and\u000a      responding to diverse offenders and prisoners', contributing to CAC's\u000a      strategic aim &#8212; to generate applied research that recognises and responds\u000a      to the needs of stakeholders in and around the CJS, and three strategic\u000a      objectives &#8212; to promote a better public understanding of the CJS; improve\u000a      the operation of the CJS within specific agencies and institutions; and\u000a      enable offenders to tackle barriers to desistance. A summary of\u000a      underpinning research is provided below, which has provided the foundation\u000a      for the impact detailed in section 4.\u000a    CAC's critical analysis of the English and Welsh prison estate, drawing\u000a      upon HMP Grendon as an exemplar of good practice, is detailed in our\u000a      earliest research, an authored book, What Everyone in Britain should\u000a        know about Crime and Punishment, which ran to two editions, with\u000a      Blackstone Press in 1998 and Oxford University Press in 2001. Professor\u000a      Wilson's subsequent work generated general insights into the prisoner\u000a      perspective on the therapeutic process (Wilson &amp; McCabe, 2002). This\u000a      has been continued jointly with Visiting Professor Brookes, who draws upon\u000a      his professional perspective as Director of Therapeutic Communities at HMP\u000a      Grendon (Brookes 2010a, 2010b).\u000a    CAC's research has shed light upon the nature of specific groups of\u000a      offenders at HMP Grendon and their needs whilst incarcerated, particularly\u000a      paedophiles and Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) prisoners. With regards to\u000a      the former, research has investigated how the fantasy lives of paedophiles\u000a      relates to their index offences (Wilson &amp; Jones, 2008) and how to\u000a      manage paedophiles within custody and after release (Silverman &amp;\u000a      Wilson, 2002). In terms of the latter, Brookes and Wilson, with Glynn &#8212; a\u000a      former PhD student funded by CAC (2010-2013), researched how therapeutic\u000a      communities should understand and accommodate needs specific to prisoners\u000a      from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds (Brookes, Glynn &amp; Wilson,\u000a      2011). In addition, CAC research led by Dr Caulfield evaluated particular\u000a      initiatives at HMP Grendon, notably the Artist in Residence, and explored\u000a      the experiences of women prison officers working with male offenders.\u000a    Key researchers\u000a      Brookes.

To try to understand the\u000d\u000a        impact of statelessness better, the State Department's Bureau of\u000d\u000a        Population, Refugees, and Migration recently funded a study by Kingston\u000d\u000a        University to examine the costs of statelessness. Among its most\u000d\u000a        striking findings, the study proved that statelessness reduces household\u000d\u000a        income by a third, and reduces the odds of owning one's home by nearly\u000d\u000a        60 percent. The average education of stateless households is lower than\u000d\u000a        that of citizens by at least one year and in some cases as many as six\u000d\u000a        years. The study also demonstrated disadvantages for stateless persons\u000d\u000a        in terms of health status, and access to justice and law enforcement.\u000d\u000a    Otero then records that Secretary Clinton has identified women's\u000d\u000a      nationality rights as an important area of work for the State Department\u000d\u000a      and sets out two objectives including `the strength of our public\u000d\u000a        diplomacy to increase global awareness of women's nationality rights',\u000d\u000a      as recommended in the above report. [See: (1) http:\/\/www.state.gov\/j\/176132.htm]\u000d\u000a    On 7 December, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton then declares: `The\u000d\u000a        United States has launched an initiative to build global awareness about\u000d\u000a        these issues and support efforts to end or amend such discriminatory\u000d\u000a        laws.

Over 120 interviews were conducted with formerly\u000d\u000a      stateless people in Bangladesh, Estonia, the Gulf states, Kenya,\u000d\u000a      Mauritania, Slovenia, Sri Lanka and Ukraine.

Specifically, they found that:\u000d\u000a    i) Demographics matter: where there were a large number of stateless\u000d\u000a      people relative to the overall population, as in Kenya, there was clear\u000d\u000a      political interest in regularizing their status;\u000d\u000a    ii) Populations with a recognized ethno-national identity are more easily\u000d\u000a      integrated: a shared understanding of historical relationship of the state\u000d\u000a      concerned to the respective populations appears to determine the\u000d\u000a      degree\/manner in which they have been integrated post-statelessness;\u000d\u000a    iii) The ending of direct discrimination on the basis of nationality does\u000d\u000a      not undo structural effects or other modes of discrimination.\u000d\u000a    The third project, `Measuring the Costs of Statelessness: A Livelihoods\u000d\u000a      Analysis in Four Countries', funded by the United States Department of\u000d\u000a      State, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration [US$180,000], (July\u000d\u000a      2010 - August 2011), was led by Blitz and followed from his 2011 book. The\u000d\u000a      final report applied innovative methodological approaches from Lakshman's\u000d\u000a      previous quantitative studies of displaced livelihoods. The team surveyed\u000d\u000a      980 households and conducted 60 interviews with formerly stateless and\u000d\u000a      natural born citizens to quantify how the denial and deprivation of\u000d\u000a      citizenship undermines people's rights and livelihood options in\u000d\u000a      Bangladesh, Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Slovenia. The originality and impact of\u000d\u000a      the research is derived from the findings that:\u000d\u000a    i) Statelessness lowers a household's per capita income by 34 per cent.\u000d\u000a    ii) Statelessness has a negative impact on the acquisition of human\u000d\u000a      capital.

Using a `Professional\u000a      Bystander Intervention Model' as a theoretical lens through which to view\u000a      decision-making, the project aimed to understand the circumstances in\u000a      which social care, health and banking professionals do and do not\u000a      intervene when financial abuse of elderly people is suspected. Financial\u000a      abuse was chosen as the topic of study because it is believed to be the\u000a      most common type of elder abuse, yet had been one of the least studied.\u000a    The project, led by Prof Mary Gilhooly (Brunel University) included\u000a      co-investigators from the Universities of Plymouth, Sheffield,\u000a      Northumbria, and Hertfordshire. The project partners included the British\u000a      Association of Social Workers, North Tyneside Council, AgeUK, Action on\u000a      Elder Abuse, the Relatives and Residents Association and HSBC. The\u000a      research was conducted between September 2008 and March 2011, with a\u000a      Follow-on Knowledge Transfer grant which ran from September 2011 to August\u000a      2012.\u000a    There were three phases to the research:\u000a    Phase I - In the first phase of the project we interviewed social\u000a      care, health and banking\/finance professionals about actual incidents of\u000a      suspected financial abuse. The aim was to identify the `decision cues'\u000a      used in judging whether or not a case represents financial abuse. These\u000a      cues were then used to develop case scenarios for the next Phase. (Ref\u000a      1-3)\u000a    Phase II - In this phase we conducted experiments using case\u000a      scenarios (factorial surveys) to test hypotheses about the factors that\u000a      account for the greatest variance in judgment and decision- making about\u000a      elder financial abuse. We statistically modelled decision-making behaviour\u000a      across a large set of scenarios with the aim of determining the decision\u000a      cues that accounted for the greatest variance in (a) certainty that\u000a      financial abuse was taking place, (b) likelihood of taking action and (c)\u000a      action taken. We also tested for consistency and discrimination in order\u000a      to identify the experts amongst the sample. The data was analysed\u000a      quantitatively using regression techniques and cluster analysis. We found\u000a      that of the many factors which professionals thought they used in\u000a      decision-making, only a few appeared to persuade them that financial abuse\u000a      was taking place. Likewise, only a handful of factors influenced\u000a      decision-making in relation to the likelihood of taking action or the\u000a      subsequent actions taken. The decision cues that exerted the greatest\u000a      influence were the mental capacity of the older person, the nature of the\u000a      financial problem and, in the case of those in finance, who was in charge\u000a      of the money. The characteristics of the professionals appeared to have\u000a      little influence on the decisions they made. Age, years of experience,\u000a      gender, etc., did not influence certainty of identifying financial abuse\u000a      or the likelihood they would take action (Ref 4 and 5)\u000a    Phase III - The aim of this phase of the NDA study was to explore\u000a      (i) commonalities in policies and guidelines as to which cues should raise\u000a      suspicions of financial abuse and what should happen in terms of\u000a      interventions, and (ii) the extent to which current policies and\u000a      guidelines match what actually happens in situations of real-world\u000a      decision-making. Both qualitative and quantitative data were culled from\u000a      the documents to provide an account of the policy and guidance\u000a      environment. The policy analysis revealed little comparative evaluation of\u000a      the efficiency of safeguarding procedures in different authorities and no\u000a      evidence base underpinning the effectiveness of decision-making in cases\u000a      of suspected financial abuse (Ref 6). Dissemination activities,\u000a      particularly events with social care professionals, revealed an\u000a      overwhelming consensus that a training tool should be developed to assist\u000a      various professional groups to accurately identify and deal with cases of\u000a      financial elder abuse. With the ESRC Knowledge Transfer award the findings\u000a      were used to develop a web-based training resource for social care, health\u000a      and finance professionals to use in continuing professional development\u000a      (see http:\/\/www.elderfinancialabuse.co.uk).\u000a      We tested the efficacy of our training tool through a randomised\u000a      controlled trial. There was a statistically significant positive effect of\u000a      the training on professional capacity to detect and prevent financial\u000a      elder abuse. This was then combined with a range of resources (e.g.\u000a      podcasts and case vignettes) to provide a free resource to enhance\u000a      professionals' decision-making capacity in relation to elder financial\u000a      abuse.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20917","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This programme of interlinked studies has had a significant and sustained\u000d\u000a      impact on government\u000d\u000a      policy and professional practice in promoting and safeguarding the\u000d\u000a      wellbeing of children in need.\u000d\u000a      Evidence of its international significance and reach is demonstrated by\u000d\u000a      the fact that practice tools\u000d\u000a      developed from our early research findings (the Looking After Children\u000d\u000a      programme) have been\u000d\u000a      implemented by all child welfare agencies in Ontario [5.1], are\u000d\u000a      being utilised by all youth services\u000d\u000a      in Quebec [5.2], and support approximately half of all children in\u000d\u000a      care in Australia [5.3]; and that\u000d\u000a      the costing methodology is being adapted for use in the United States [5.4].The\u000d\u000a      programme's\u000d\u000a      reach includes policymakers, practitioners and children and families\u000d\u000a      receiving social care services\u000d\u000a      in Australia, Canada, France, the Ukraine and the USA as well as in the UK\u000d\u000a      [5.5].

In\u000d\u000a      Britain [5.5], Canada [5.1; 5.2] and Australia [5.3],\u000d\u000a      the research has been influential in moving the\u000d\u000a      debate forward to considering outcomes of care in terms of children's\u000d\u000a      developmental progress and\u000d\u000a      capacity to meet their potential. New evidence concerning the long-term\u000d\u000a      consequences of abuse\u000d\u000a      and neglect have enabled us to argue that the poor outcomes of care are\u000d\u000a      related to the inability of\u000d\u000a      the system to compensate for previous adverse experience and to call for\u000d\u000a      more specialist provision\u000d\u000a      for those who remain looked after, more proactive decisions for those for\u000d\u000a      whom adoption is the\u000d\u000a      best option, and more effective services to safeguard those who remain at\u000d\u000a      home.

Two examples of evidence of\u000a      direct public engagement with the research findings are: 2000 comments\u000a      posted on the BBC website debating what should be considered as essentials\u000a      in 12 hours following the publication of Reference [3.1]; in the\u000a      nine months following the publication of [3.2], 35,000 unique\u000a      users accessed the on-line Minimum Income Calculator [5.1].\u000a    - This has been followed up by extensive use of the benchmark in policy\u000a      analysis and comment by social policy analysts, recognising MIS as a valid\u000a      benchmark For example:\u000a    - IMPACT 2 The Progressive Conservatism project at the Demos\u000a      think-tank produced a report arguing for a raising of personal tax\u000a      thresholds to the Minimum Income Standard for a single person, thus using\u000a      our research (Study B; finding 2) to benchmark a major policy proposal [5.2].\u000a      This has contributed to the rationale for the present government's policy\u000a      of raising tax thresholds.\u000a    - IMPACT 3 The Pensions Policy Institute used MIS as a key\u000a      benchmark in a report (2009) considering how high pensions need to be in\u000a      order to meet minimum needs in retirement [5.3]. In 2010, the\u000a      Treasury's consultation paper on annuities reform suggested MIS as one\u000a      potential criterion for a \"minimum income requirement\" [5.4].\u000a      These analyses related to Study A, finding 1.\u000a    2) Use by charities in means testing (IMPACT 4)\u000a    Various charities use the MIS as a threshold to determine whether to\u000a      assist people in hardship (using Finding 1, Studies A to C above). For\u000a      example \"Independent Age\", use it to determine the distribution of &#163;6m a\u000a      year in grants to older people [5.5].\u000a    3) Use to campaign for and set a \"living wage\" (IMPACT 5)\u000a    Living wage campaigns have been growing in the UK, but have not hitherto\u000a      systematically produced and updated evidence for what is an acceptable\u000a      wage to live on. Secondary analysis of MIS has allowed us to produce\u000a      living wage figures rooted in public acceptability (based on Studies A to\u000a      C, Finding 2). These have been taken up by campaigners and used as a\u000a      benchmark in wage-setting practice. The Living Wage Campaign has adopted a\u000a      Living Wage level for outside London based explicitly on MIS [5.6].\u000a      By November 2012, 30,000 employees outside London had received pay\u000a      increases worth a total of &#163;33 million directly as a result of employers\u000a      adopting the living wage level based on MIS, according to an estimate made\u000a      by Queen Mary University of London.\u000a    The living wage based on MIS has been adopted by Birmingham, Glasgow,\u000a      Newcastle and other local authorities, in some cases applying to\u000a      procurement of services as well as directly applied staff. The MIS work\u000a      has been central to local analysis of the case for the living wage [5.7].\u000a      The living wage is also being used by the Government of Scotland for its\u000a      own staff. Donald Hirsch gave evidence to the Scottish Parliament about\u000a      MIS and its relevance for wages at the time that this was being adopted [5.8].\u000a      The trade union side of pay negotiations for local government staff (NJC)\u000a      used MIS as a basis for negotiating a pay settlement for England, Wales\u000a      and Northern Ireland for 2010-11 [5.9]. In 2012, the General Synod\u000a      of the Church of England voted to encourage all C of E churches to pay the\u000a      Living Wage, stating in the paper supporting the resolution: \"The\u000a      independent Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough\u000a      University conduct thorough and rigorous research to work out what is\u000a      needed for an adequate standard of living\" [5.10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2008, continuous research at Loughborough University, currently led\u000a      by Donald Hirsch, has identified a minimum socially acceptable level of\u000a      income in the UK, based on detailed consultation with the general public\u000a      to define minimum needs. Its impacts are underpinned by close engagement\u000a      with the public and with organisations promoting social welfare,\u000a      establishing it as an accepted national benchmark. The standard has become\u000a      a reference point in analysis of public policy, and been used directly by\u000a      charities to distribute money equitably and by wage negotiators and\u000a      campaigners to identify a \"living wage\" level, implemented by a wide range\u000a      of employers.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    Loughborough University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Loughborough University","InstitutionName":"Loughborough University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10004113}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Principal research outputs from the main research include the following\u000a      published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, whose reports are subjected\u000a      to external expert scrutiny and are known for their quality and authority:\u000a    3.1.

Since 2008, it has produced annual\u000a      figures showing how much different household types need for a minimum\u000a      acceptable standard of living.\u000a    The research brings together the two leading approaches to compiling\u000a      minimum household budgets: expert-led research and \"consensual\"\u000a      deliberation among panels of members of the public. In the combined MIS\u000a      method, panels decide budgets, informed where relevant by experts.\u000a      Loughborough University pioneered the development of consensual methods\u000a      (supported by The Family Budget Unit, University of York, until it closed\u000a      down). Main MIS studies have been:\u000a    The first full study, in 2008 (Study A, 3.1).\u000a      The 2010 review study, with new groups reviewing budgets, (Study B).\u000a      The 2012 study, by \"rebasing\" some households' budgets through fresh\u000a      research, and reviewing others, (Study C, 3.2).\u000a    The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) has funded this research.\u000a      Supplementary research on rural areas was funded by the Commission for\u000a      Rural Communities in England and by a coalition of stakeholders in\u000a      Scotland. The former produced research on MIS budgets in rural England\u000a      (Study D, 3.4).\u000a    The research found that:\u000a    - Finding 1: Means-tested benefits are much too low for a minimum living\u000a      standard for working age households, but about right for pensioners,\u000a      before taking account of additional needsbased on individual circumstances\u000a      [3.1, 3.2].\u000a    - Finding 2: The minimum wage is too low for most working households to\u000a      reach an acceptable living standard [3.1, 3.2].\u000a    - Finding 3: Minimum household costs have been rising faster than average\u000a      prices, and much faster than typical household incomes, since 2008 [3.2].\u000a    This research programme has three particular strengths contributing to\u000a      its usefulness:\u000a    - Credibility. A \"socially defined minimum\", the MIS represents\u000a      what members of the public think that everybody needs, at least for an\u000a      acceptable standard of living. This is rooted in qualitative research,\u000a      with decisions corroborated by multiple groups and confirmed by experts.\u000a    - Accessibility Clearly written reports and summaries are backed\u000a      by an easy to use online calculator showing the minimum income relevant to\u000a      a wide variety of household types and situations.\u000a    - Contemporary relevance. Continuous updating keeps findings\u000a      relevant to changing social and economic conditions. Since MIS considers\u000a      what incomes people need to participate in contemporary society,\u000a      timeliness is at the heart of its usefulness.\u000a    The main researchers, all based in Loughborough's Centre for Research in\u000a      Social Policy, have been:\u000a    Donald Hirsch, Head of Income Studies 2008-2012, Director since 2012: led\u000a      Studies B and C.

With a statistic of\u000a      33% from Rape Crisis Scotland in December 2010, this demonstrated the new\u000a      legislation has\u000a      almost doubled the rate of conviction for those cases of rape brought to\u000a      court. Lord Advocate\u000a      Frank Mulholland stated that `the new Sexual Offences Act brought\u000a        about significant changes in\u000a        the prosecution of sexual crime in Scotland'.\u000a    Findings from the first Scottish study on `rape shield' legislation were\u000a      published in 1993, amending\u000a      existing legislation in 1995 and ultimately informing the Sexual Offences\u000a      (Procedure and Evidence)\u000a      (Scotland) Act 2002. The research was cited in a House of Lords Appeal\u000a      judgment, and went on to\u000a      underpin the Scottish Government consultation document Redressing the\u000a        Balance: Cross-Examination in Rape and Sexual Offence Trials.\u000a      The second and third `rape shield' studies\u000a      informed the COPFS Review of Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual\u000a        Offences in Scotland\u000a      (2006) and the Scottish Investigators' Guide to\u000a        Serious Sexual Offences. This research also\u000a      formed the basis of advice to the Scottish Law\u000a      Commission's Review of Law on Rape and the\u000a      Scottish Justice Committee consultation which led\u000a      in turn to the development of the Sexual Offences\u000a      (Scotland) Act 2009.\u000a   \u000a   \u000a  \u000a  A campaign from Rape Crisis Scotland (2008) was\u000a      directly influenced by Burman's research evaluating\u000a      the impact of sexual history and character evidence\u000a      in sexual offence trials. The promotional postcard\u000a      from this campaign\u000a      asks `Who's really on trial?' and\u000a      continues to feature on the Rape Crisis Scotland website. Rape Crisis\u000a      Scotland says, 'Professor\u000a        Burman's research into rape shield legislation has been very valuable in\u000a        informing Rape Crisis\u000a        Scotland campaigning against the use of sexual history and character\u000a        evidence in rape trials, and\u000a        in providing both statistical data and anecdotal evidence of the\u000a        damaging impact this can have on\u000a        rape complainers and their chances of obtaining justice.'\u000a    Burman's research and testimony to the Justice Committee on the Scottish\u000a      Parliament's proposed\u000a      Sexual Offences Scotland Bill (18 November 2008) contributed to the 2009\u000a      Act. It also influenced\u000a      the definition of consent in law as `free agreement' and the requirement\u000a      for the defence to provide\u000a      evidence of having sought consent. Burman's research showed that consent\u000a      and the credibility of\u000a      the complainer are at the heart of most rape cases, and the need to prove\u000a      non-consent often leads\u000a      to arduous cross-examination of the complainer, and questioning on her\u000a      sexual history and\u000a      character, which rape shield legislation often fails to restrict. Under\u000a      the 2009 Act, the accused must\u000a      now demonstrate that they took steps to establish consent, rather than the\u000a      focus on the victim to\u000a      demonstrate non-consent. Ultimately, this aims to reduce secondary\u000a      victimisation, and encourage\u000a      victims to come forward to report, thus addressing a long-term policy\u000a      concern about under-reporting of rape.\u000a    Informing policy and practitioner debate\u000a    Professor Burman's research has led to numerous invitations to address\u000a      and engage with a wide\u000a      range of academic and professional conferences and consultative sessions\u000a      for those involved in\u000a      the formulation and implementation of policy in this area, including\u000a      lawyers, policy officials and third\u000a      sector organisations. This has included: a keynote address to the Rape\u000a      Crisis Conference (2008);\u000a      an invited address (with Derek Ogg QC, then Head of the Crown Office\u000a      National Sexual Crimes\u000a      Unit) at the Association of Criminal Justice and Development Annual\u000a      Conference (Dublin, October\u000a      2009); participation in an intersectoral round table considering the scope\u000a      of the Gender Equality\u000a      Duty for informing criminal justice responses to violence against women\u000a      for the Equality and\u000a      Human Rights Commission (Glasgow 2009); a plenary address to the Annual\u000a      Conference on\u000a      Sexual Crime hosted by the COPFS (2009) on rape attrition; a presentation\u000a      for the Europe-wide\u000a      comparative event organised under the auspices of the Daphne 11 Programme,\u000a      in Athens,\u000a      Greece; and a keynote address on rape law reform in Scotland to the\u000a      intersectoral workshop on\u000a      Re-thinking Responses to Rape (2011).\u000a    Her body of research has also led to further commissioned work, such as\u000a      Burman acting as\u000a      Academic Reviewer for Baroness Vivien Stern's (2009) Review of\u000a        Criminal Justice Responses to\u000a        Rape and Sexual Assault in England and Wales, and membership of a\u000a      specialist advisory group\u000a      for the EHRC-funded project Map of Needs, which mapped violence against\u000a      women support\u000a      services in the UK in 2009. Throughout 2013, Burman has been providing\u000a      consultation and advice,\u000a      and (with colleagues) commissioned by the Scottish Government to provide\u000a      an international\u000a      literature review of best practice interventions in gender-based violence\u000a      to inform Scotland's cross-government strategy on violence against women.\u000a    Shaping practitioner training\u000a    Burman's research has informed considerable discussion among\u000a      practitioners, challenging existing\u000a      understanding and helping to build consensus on the need for specific\u000a      changes in practice and\u000a      legislation. On the basis of her research, Burman was invited (2004) by\u000a      the Judicial Studies\u000a      Committee to provide judicial training to the Scottish judiciary on sexual\u000a      offences and, in particular\u000a      the law of evidence in relation to sexual offences. This continued on an\u000a      annual basis and in 2010,\u000a      culminated in her participation in an innovative training DVD, shot in the\u000a      High Court and produced\u000a      by the Judicial Studies Committee (now the Judicial Institute) (Judicial\u000a        Skills: Sexual Offences and\u000a        Expert Evidence, March 2010). The DVD was initially used as part of\u000a      a training module developed\u000a      by the Director of the Judicial Institute for Scotland as a direct result\u000a      of Burman's `rape shield'\u000a      research. This bespoke training module was delivered to 35 High Court\u000a      Judges in June 2010\u000a      incuding the Lord Justice General and Lord Justice Clerk. The training\u000a      also included a number of\u000a      Canadian judges in conjunction with international judicial training\u000a      partner, the National Judicial\u000a      Institute of Canada. The Director of the Judicial Institute for Scotland\u000a      stated; `I was very pleased\u000a        with the module which explores the rationale behind the need for rape\u000a        shield legislation... The\u000a        module also raises awareness among the judges of your [Burman's]\u000a        research and various\u000a        criticisms that you [Burman] make in relation to the operation of the\u000a        shield. It also gave the judges\u000a        an opportunity to discuss with Canadian Judges how equivalent\u000a        legislation operates in\u000a        Canada...the DVD was and remains an extrememly valuable training tool\u000a        which has much life still\u000a        left in it'. This DVD is now regularly used for the induction of\u000a      Scottish and Canadian High Court\u000a      Judges and Sheriffs.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Legislation, policy and practice surrounding the criminal justice\u000a      response to rape in Scotland have\u000a      been profoundly influenced by the work of Professor Michele Burman.

The first\u000a      two projects employed in-court observation (over 200 trials heard in the\u000a      High and Sheriff courts),\u000a      analysis of case files and trial transcripts, in addition to interviews\u000a      with judges, sheriffs, defence\u000a      counsel and prosecution. The third project also included interviews with\u000a      female complainers on\u000a      their experience of giving evidence. The research found that successive\u000a      legislative attempts at\u000a      restricting the use of sexual history and character evidence had been\u000a      unsuccessful, and suggested\u000a      ways in which the criminal justice response could be improved. Burman's\u000a      earlier studies (1993;\u000a      2005) pointed to how legislation failed to discourage the use of such\u000a      evidence; demonstrated that\u000a      there was a lack of clarity on admissible content; and showed that even\u000a      where such evidence was\u000a      considered relevant and admissible, its probative value was frequently\u000a      weak when compared with\u000a      its prejudicial effect. The research also identified the lack of any\u000a      express requirement that evidence\u000a      or questioning must be relevant before it is admitted; the lack of any\u000a      weighing up of the potentially\u000a      prejudicial effect caused by diverting a jury's attention from the issues\u000a      it requires to determine in\u000a      arriving at a verdict; the lack of guidance on the content of a decision\u000a      on admissibility; and the fact\u000a      that the complainer's privacy and dignity were not accorded any particular\u000a      status. These\u000a      deficiencies were acknowledged in policy guidance and the research\u000a      informed subsequent\u000a      legislation which attempted to address the problems. The third study\u000a      (2007) was undertaken with\u000a      Lynn Jamieson (University of Edinburgh), Jan Nicholson and Oona Brooks\u000a      (both University of\u000a      Glasgow), and evaluated the use of the new legislation and revealed an\u000a      unanticipated outcome -that it led to more detailed and extensive\u000a      questioning on sexual matters. It also demonstrated that\u000a      the complainer's privacy and dignity were not always respected,\u000a      highlighting the process of giving\u000a      evidence as a form of `secondary victimisation'.\u000a    The fourth research project (2009), in which Burman was a partner, was\u000a      funded by the European\u000a      Commission Daphne II Programme to combat violence against children, young\u000a      people and women\u000a      (led by Professor Liz Kelly, London Metropolitan University). This was an\u000a      analysis of rape attrition\u000a      (the process by which the majority of reported rape cases fail to reach\u000a      trial) of cases in 11\u000a      countries, and involved studying administrative data on arrest,\u000a      prosecution and conviction rates\u000a      over a 30-year period, alongside interviews with policy officials and\u000a      criminal justice practitioners\u000a      and the tracking of 100 rape cases from point of report to the police.\u000a      Burman led the study in\u000a      Scotland; with the Scots criminal law and justice system varying\u000a      significantly from that of England\u000a      and Wales, it formed an important and distinctive part of the Europe-wide\u000a      project. This research\u000a      found that Scottish arrest and custody rates were amongst the highest of\u000a      all countries, and that\u000a      attrition in Scottish cases took place across the legal process, most\u000a      markedly during the later\u000a      stages of the investigation. The findings also provided a strong challenge\u000a      to existing conviction rate\u000a      estimates, which had been calculated solely by administrative data.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21348","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    University of Glasgow research has provided critical scrutiny of the\u000a      media, identifying a particular shift in representations of disabled\u000a      people. It has stimulated widespread public debate about the relationship\u000a      between this representation, proposed changes in the provision of state\u000a      disability support, and the rise in disability hate crime. The 'Bad News\u000a      for Disabled People' report (2011) was widely disseminated by a range of\u000a      disability support and advocacy groups, cited by trade unions and\u000a      parliamentarians in Westminster, the House of Lords and Holyrood. Many of\u000a      these organisations have used the report directly to support their\u000a      campaigns.\u000a    Informing political debate\u000a    This research ignited the political debate on media representations of\u000a      disabled people. For example, on 14 November 2011, the report was directly\u000a      cited by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson in a welfare reform debate in the\u000a        House of Lords as evidence of widespread misrepresentation of\u000a      disabled people and disability benefits. Also in November 2011, the Shadow\u000a      Minister for Disability Issues referred directly to the University of\u000a      Glasgow findings in a House\u000a        of Commons debate on disability hate crime. The report was also\u000a      mentioned during discussion in the Work\u000a        and Pensions Select Committee (February 2012), allowing the National\u000a      Autistic Society and Disability Alliance to draw attention to `the\u000a      negative tone adopted in the media about wider disability issues'. The\u000a      Committee Chair also used the research in the in the Committee's\u000a      questioning of DWP Ministers concerning the changing attitudes to disabled\u000a      people and the transformation of the language used to represent disabled\u000a      people and disability benefits in the media. The research was cited in the\u000a      Work and Pensions Select Committee's report Government\u000a          support towards the extra living costs of working age disabled people\u000a      and in a Westminster Briefing prepared by The\u000a          Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology on Work Capacity\u000a          Assessment. The Committee Chair has also drawn from the\u000a      research in the preparation of speeches and articles relating to the\u000a      change of language used to describe disabled people since the 2010 General\u000a      Election.\u000a    Informing public and media debate\u000a    The impact of this research on the wider public debate around disability\u000a      issues was significant. The report formed the basis of three articles\u000a      published in The Guardian (October-November 2011) and a full-page\u000a      feature in The Observer (December 2011). Media coverage has\u000a      included discussions of the stigma associated with a mental health\u000a      condition, reports on the harassment of benefit claimants and wider\u000a      representations of disability in public life. The Editor of the Disability\u000a        News Service writes:\u000a    The research has been useful to me in my work and hugely\u000a        influential... I have heard the report mentioned repeatedly at\u000a        conferences, by campaigners, and in parliamentary meetings. I believe it\u000a        is the piece of research quoted more than any other when campaigners are\u000a        trying to provide evidence of the impact of negative media coverage on\u000a        disabled people and their lives. What was most useful in the report, I\u000a        think, was that it provided quantitative evidence of the shift in how\u000a        disabled people were being written about by the media. That subsequently\u000a        provided a powerful tool for disabled people to fight back.\u000a    In particular, University of Glasgow findings led to critical assessment\u000a      of the media construction of disabled people as fraudulent benefit\u000a      claimants. In The Observer (December 2011), Ian Birrell refers\u000a      specifically to the research and argues that `It is grossly irresponsible\u000a      for journalists and politicians to collude in this manner to create a\u000a      climate encouraging hatred, hostility and abuse towards people for whom\u000a      life is already so difficult. This would be true at any time, but\u000a      especially at a time of such uncertainty, when people are fearful of the\u000a      future and looking for others to blame for their misfortune. Those with\u000a      disabilities should not be made scapegoats for other people's sins.' This\u000a      article attracted over 450 comments.\u000a    The `Bad News for Disabled People' report was also submitted to the\u000a      Leveson Inquiry into Culture Practice and Ethics of the Press (2011-12),\u000a      and omission of any significant reference to disability in the enquiry\u000a      report only fuelled public debate further with The Guardian (May\u000a      2012) charging Lord Justice Leveson with `ignoring evidence - in this\u000a        case that some journalists, fed by unscrupulous politicians, are\u000a        whipping up a perfect storm for disabled people.'\u000a    Informing support groups, advocacy and campaigns\u000a    Finally, the research has had significant impact within the disabled\u000a      community and among non-governmental organisations that support and\u000a      campaign for disability issues. `Bad News for Disabled People' has\u000a      provided organisations with clear research evidence to inform their\u000a      campaigns; by defining and quantifying misrepresentations in the media it\u000a      has given weight call for changes in public attitudes towards issues of\u000a      equality. Inclusion London states:\u000a    The research `Bad News for Disabled People' has been of fundamental\u000a        importance in not only Inclusion London's work but in the work of\u000a        Disabled People's Organisations and disabled people led campaigns across\u000a        the UK. Disabled people are very aware of the impact of media messaging\u000a        on welfare and benefits on public perceptions of disability...Negative\u000a        and hostile media portrayals need to be understood within this context\u000a        in order to understand their full significance. Having solid research to\u000a        substantiate our arguments and to support the anecdotal evidence we have\u000a        from disabled people is absolutely invaluable.\u000a    These findings were used in campaigning by organisations including Scope,\u000a      Disabled People Against Cuts, Disability Arts in London, the Disability\u000a      Alliance and I Spartacus. They have formed the basis of articles in Disability\u000a        Now (January 2012), and on sites such as Disability Arts Online\u000a      (December 2011). On the 17 November 2011, the research was cited by the\u000a      National Union of Journalists in a press release `Stop\u000a        calling disabled people scroungers'. Disability Rights UK cited the\u000a      University of Glasgow research in the development of their Disability\u000a        Hate Crime Guidance (February 2012), launched online and by press\u000a      release to a range of outlets. The guidance discussed a rise in hostile\u000a      attitudes experienced by disabled people, questioning whether this type of\u000a      coverage is encouraged by the government in order to justify an austerity\u000a      agenda which includes disability benefit cuts.\u000a    This research, then, as well as informing public and political debate to\u000a      a significant extent, has made an influential contribution to campaigns\u000a      for social and cultural change; by providing evidence of the nature and\u000a      extent of stigmatization affecting disabled people, it has allowed those\u000a      campaigning around these issues to more effectively challenge these\u000a      misrepresentations.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    `Scrounger', `cheat', `skiver' - Disabled people are feeling increasingly\u000a      threatened by how they are represented in the media.

The research was carried out\u000a      by Professor Nick Watson (Chair of Disability Studies, Director of the\u000a      UoG-based Strathclyde Centre for Disability Research, 2004-present);\u000a      Professor Greg Philo (Professor of Communications and Change, Director of\u000a      the Glasgow Media Group 1977-present); and Emma Briant (Research\u000a      Associate, School of Social and Political Sciences, 2010-present). This\u000a      study built on earlier bodies of work developed by Watson and Philo,\u000a      including a number of projects, publications and research grants as\u000a      directors of the Strathclyde Centre for Disability Research (SCDR,\u000a      University of Glasgow) and the Glasgow Media Group (University of\u000a      Glasgow), respectively.\u000a    Between 2001 and 2011, Watson had researched and written extensively on\u000a      the social and cultural exclusion of disabled people from different\u000a      domains of public life, including education, health and welfare, and the\u000a      workplace. In 2011, Watson and colleagues from the SCDR investigated the\u000a      implementation of the Disability Equality Duty, which requires public\u000a      sector organisations in England to develop policies to promote equality\u000a      for disabled people as staff members, consumers or visitors. Watson and\u000a      his co-researchers found that, in spite of good initial efforts to\u000a      implement the Disability Equality Duty, significantly more needed to be\u000a      done within the culture of work and service provision in order to ensure\u000a      equal treatment.\u000a    In 2008, Philo undertook a series of influential empirical studies\u000a      investigating the role of media in relation to the development of social\u000a      attitudes and beliefs. A common finding in this work was that although\u000a      audiences have the capacity to question or respond critically to news\u000a      stories, the influence of media does significantly shape public attitudes.\u000a      In 1996, the Glasgow Media Group carried out highly regarded research\u000a      which sought to investigate the representation of health issues\u000a      (particularly mental health) in the media. The 1996 study also considered\u000a      the impact of these representations on public beliefs and attitudes, and\u000a      on carers and users of mental health services.\u000a    Thus the research project carried out by Watson and Philo on behalf of\u000a      Inclusion London brought together long-standing concerns of their previous\u000a      work. It sought to focus on inequality in light of changing depictions of\u000a      disabled people in media, at a time when policies were being introduced to\u000a      limit social welfare provisions for disabled people. The study compared\u000a      and contrasted media coverage of disability in five papers in 2010\/11 with\u000a      a similar period in 2004\/5 and ran 8 focus groups examining the reception\u000a      of these stories, 2 with people who identified as disabled and 6 with\u000a      nondisabled people. The key findings of the study were that:\u000a    \u000a      There had been a significant increase in the reporting of disability\u000a        in the print media, with 713 disability-related articles in 2004\/5\u000a        compared to 1,015 between 2010\/11. This increase was accompanied by a\u000a        shift in the way in which disability was being reported; media coverage\u000a        of disability was increasingly politicised in 2010\/11 compared to\u000a        2004\/5;\u000a      There had been a reduction in the proportion of articles which\u000a        described disabled people in sympathetic terms, and stories that\u000a        documented the `real life' experiences of living as a disabled person\u000a        had also decreased. Certain groups were less likely to receive\u000a        sympathetic treatment, people with mental health conditions and other\u000a        `hidden' impairments were more likely to be presented as `undeserving'\u000a        of benefit support;\u000a      Articles focusing on disability benefit and fraud increased from 2.8%\u000a        (of the sample) in 2004\/5 to 6.1% in 2010\/11. Also, the recognition of\u000a        this implicit connection was apparent in the audience research: when the\u000a        focus groups were asked to describe a typical newspaper story regarding\u000a        disability, benefit fraud was the theme which most frequently arose;\u000a      This shift in coverage was impacting on views and perceptions\u000a        regarding disability benefits. Members of focus groups all presumed\u000a        levels of benefit fraud as much higher than they were in reality, with\u000a        some suggesting that up to 70% of claimants were fraudulent.\u000a        Participants predominantly justified these claims by reference to\u000a        articles they had read in newspapers;\u000a      There had been an increase in the number of articles describing the\u000a        `burden' of disabled people on the economy, and some articles went so\u000a        far as to blame the recession on the existing level of incapacity\u000a        benefit claims;\u000a      Articles that explored the political and socioeconomic context of\u000a        disability were rare, as were articles that explored the impact of\u000a        proposed government spending cuts on disabled people. There was a\u000a        reduction in references to discrimination against disabled people, and a\u000a        general reduction in contextualisation of the issues reported;\u000a      There had been a significant increase in the use of pejorative\u000a        language to describe disabled people, including suggestions that\u000a        reliance on incapacity benefit had become a `lifestyle choice'. The use\u000a        of terms such as `scrounger', `cheat' and `skiver' were found in 18% of\u000a        tabloid articles in 2010\/11 compared to 12% in 2004\/5. There were 54\u000a        occurrences of these words in 2004\/5 compared to 142 occurrences in\u000a        2010\/11.\u000a      Disabled people felt threatened by the way in which disability was\u000a        being reported, as well as the proposed changes to their benefits and\u000a        entitlements. The research demonstrated that the shift in representation\u000a        and the threat to support were seen as interlinked developments, with\u000a        the former providing a moral justification for the latter.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21756","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Increasing access to finance for excluded groups:\u000a    \u000a       Through projects funded by Lloyds TSB, Barclays Bank, Esm&#233;e Fairbairn\u000a        Foundation, the Housing Corporation and European Regional Development\u000a        Fund, during the early 2000s CFS helped to set up eleven MFIs in England\u000a        (in Salford, Portsmouth, Blackburn, Preston, Derby, Sandwell, Blackpool,\u000a        East London, Cumbria, Suffolk and Devon), each of which built in lower\u000a        operational costs and greater efficiency than pre-existing models for\u000a        MFIs. Nine of these are still functioning. The most successful has been\u000a        the East Lancashire Moneyline (IPS) Ltd., (ELM) from Blackburn (with CFS\u000a        on its Board), which grew from a single office in January 2001 to 25\u000a        branches throughout the UK in 2012, employing 50 staff.\u000a       ELM's customers often do not have bank accounts and may have accrued\u000a        unmanageable debts, partly through prior high-interest loan arrangements\u000a        with money lenders. A typical customer has loans outstanding of &#163;500,\u000a        with interest standing at approximately &#163;80 per &#163;100.

The impact described in this case study is underpinned by the\u000a      following research:\u000a    \u000a       Context: 1999-onwards: In Investing in People and Places,\u000a        Dayson et al. examined the effects of financial exclusion in two\u000a        deprived neighbourhoods and considered possible ways to reduce it\u000a        through microfinance. Investing in People and Places proposed a\u000a        new form of microfinance institution (MFI) which would achieve\u000a        sustainability through lower operational costs and greater efficiency.\u000a        Dayson et al.'s research found that for one microenterprise lender it\u000a        cost &#163;8 to lend &#163;1 and that at least 19% of MFI staff time was spent on\u000a        business support and advice &#8212; an activity which decreased financial\u000a        efficiency yet which should have been provided by other organisations.\u000a       2005-2008: Lloyds TSB Operational Sustainability Research\u000a        project aimed to enhance the operational and financial performance of\u000a        the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) sector and assess\u000a        the overall profitability and sustainability of the industry through an\u000a        in-depth analysis of five UK CDFIs perceived to be market. Dayson et al.\u000a        proposed an activity-based approach to product costing which would offer\u000a        a means for MFIs to assess and improve their organisational efficiency.\u000a        The proposed assessment approach was used in a study of efficiency and\u000a        productivity in five MFIs in the UK, which identified ways to cut costs\u000a        and increase efficiency while and making recommendations about the\u000a        configuration of loan portfolios and the establishment of effective\u000a        partnerships.\u000a       2008-2011: Through two Knowledge Transfer Partnerships with\u000a        East Lancashire Moneyline (IPS) Ltd., Dayson, Vadera et al. developed a\u000a        web-based Credit Risk Assessment Tool to aid in the processing of loan\u000a        applications. CFS has worked with East Lancashire Moneyline (IPS) Ltd.,\u000a        since 2002 when the centre was founded and Dayson is a board member,\u000a        offering advice and on-going support and initiating the KTP with the\u000a        School of Computing, Science and Engineering. The KTP, which ran in two\u000a        phases from 30\/9\/2008 to 29\/9\/2010 and 29\/9\/10 to 5\/7\/11 developed a\u000a        Credit Risk Evaluation tool (CRET) and a data control system for loan\u000a        and savings account processing.\u000a       2011: Dayson et al. examined and assessed policies for\u000a        microfinance at national and international level in an evaluation of MFI\u000a        policy under the Labour administration, asserting that the transfer of\u000a        responsibility and support for MFIs from the Department of Trade and\u000a        Industry to the Regional Development Agencies led to an increased focus\u000a        on the support for small businesses at the expense of community\u000a        development &#8212; and MFI sustainability.\u000a       2005-2013: A founder member of the European Microfinance\u000a        Research Network (EMRN) (2005), Dayson led the editorial team that\u000a        published the Handbook of Microcredit in Europe, which reviewed\u000a        the experiences of 18 countries, highlighting variations in the\u000a        characteristics of MFIs and their associated practices. As a result,\u000a        Dayson identified the emergence of a new model for the delivery of\u000a        microfinance in Europe: Complex Interrelationship Microfinance\u000a          Finance Initiatives, leading to being commissioned to develop a\u000a        model for the European Community; the European Code of Good Conduct\u000a          for Microcredit Provision, which provides a set of standards for\u000a        management, governance, risk management, reporting, and consumer and\u000a        investor relations that are common to the microcredit sector in the\u000a        European Union.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22133","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In addition to having been cited widely in the UK's and Scottish\u000a      Government's policy documents, the core impacts from the desistance\u000a      research are that it has supported a challenge to conventional wisdom\u000a      around approaches to `offender management'; stimulated practitioner\u000a      debate; and has helped to effect a cultural change in the practices of\u000a      probation and prison services across several jurisdictions.\u000a    Shaping new practice skills models for probation professionals\u000a      The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) &#8212; an Executive Agency of\u000a      the Ministry of Justice which coordinates probation and prison services\u000a      across England and Wales &#8212; used desistance research as part of the\u000a      evidence base for a new practice skills model for probation professionals.\u000a      The Deputy Director of Commissioning and Competitions at NOMS explained\u000a      that NOMS drew in particular upon McNeill and Weaver's 2010 Changing\u000a        Lives? Report, which they had commissioned, with the principles\u000a      outlined in the report `feeding directly' into the design of Skills\u000a        for Effective Engagement and Development (SEED) [1].\u000a    SEED combines `core correctional practices and evidence-based\u000a        approaches with emerging thinking and evidence from the desistance\u000a        research' [1]. The model involves ongoing training for probation\u000a      professionals, including: professional development covering\u000a      relationship-building; pro-social modelling; motivational interviewing;\u000a      the risk need and responsivity principles, and cognitive behavioural\u000a      techniques. Participants also received training on desistance research\u000a      specifically. Early evaluations show the positive impact of the pilot,\u000a      with 87% of participants stating that the model is very important to their\u000a      practice [2].\u000a    Influencing Training, Practice and Service Delivery in Probation\u000a          Services\u000a\u0009\u0009  The research has influenced policy and strategic\u000a      planning in several Probation Services and Trusts, particularly in\u000a      Merseyside, and Avon and Somerset.\u000a    Merseyside Probation Trust: Senior management at the Wirral, a\u000a      local delivery unit (LDU) within Merseyside Probation Trust, sought and\u000a      funded their participation in the DesKE project (outlined above, S.2) in\u000a      late 2012 (this was in addition to the work funded by the ESRC). These\u000a      additional DesKE workshops brought probation workers and service-users\u000a      together, for the first time, to discuss issues around probation and\u000a      reoffending. `The Road From Crime' film prompted discussion and\u000a      debate, particularly around the use of the term `offender', which has\u000a      since been replaced by `service user' [3].\u000a    Wirral LDU staff have made a clear commitment to adopting desistance\u000a      principles in their working practices and to involving the `service user'\u000a      in the process [3]. A Desistance Planning Team comprising of Wirral staff\u000a      and service users has implemented a number of innovative measures,\u000a      including welfare reform workshops which acknowledge and address obstacles\u000a      to change, and a film club aimed at debating moral and ethical issues. In\u000a      addition, probation staff attended a series of workshops where they agreed\u000a      to make three changes based on desistance principles, which run counter to\u000a      conventional ways of working [3]. The Wirral LDU has expressed its desire\u000a      to extend the desistance principles to both its staff induction and risk\u000a      assessment procedures. The research can therefore be seen to have helped\u000a      redirect the training, working practice and service delivery of probation\u000a      professionals in important and innovative ways.\u000a    Avon and Somerset Probation Trust (ASPT): Similarly, Avon and\u000a      Somerset Probation Trust (ASPT) has benefited from the desistance research\u000a      and from links with the DesKE project. The Trust is committed to better\u000a      supporting desistance in its practice, an agenda that has been supported\u000a      by the recruitment of a dedicated Desistance Development Officer.\u000a    Motivated by the eight key principles outlined in McNeill and Weaver's Giving\u000a        up Crime: Directions for Policy (2007) report, ASPT developed a new\u000a      operational framework and discussed the implementation of\u000a      desistance-supporting-practices at an `away day' for ASPT and its\u000a      multi-agency partners. According to the Chief Probation Officer of ASPT,\u000a      the clarity of the principles outlined in the report provided staff with\u000a      greater focus and direction [4].\u000a    To further promote the desistance agenda, ASPT arranged a screening of The\u000a        Road from Crime at the Curzon cinema, North Somerset, in November\u000a      2012 [5] and invited McNeill to deliver a presentation on the creative\u000a      implementation of desistance at their 2013 Annual Conference. Feedback\u000a      from the events showed that the film had improved understandings of the\u000a      importance of working within desistance principles. [4].\u000a    The Voluntary and Community Sector: One of the barriers identified\u000a      by people working in the criminal justice sector to desistance is a lack\u000a      of clear and practical steps to support implementation in daily practice.\u000a      To that end, Clinks, a charity that supports VCS organisations working\u000a      with offenders, devised a practical guide for practitioners. This guide\u000a      draws heavily on McNeill's research [6] and the DesKE project is also\u000a      listed as a key resource on Clinks' website [7].\u000a    Instrumental Impact on Policy and Practice in Scotland and Northern\u000a          Ireland\u000a      Scottish Government:\u000a      Speaking at the launch of The Road from Crime at the University in\u000a      June 2012, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice (Kenny MacAskill MSP)\u000a      commented that DesKE had improved Scottish Government Officials'\u000a      understanding of the reality of desistance from crime, and influenced\u000a      their thinking about how public policy can better remove obstacles to\u000a      desistance [8]. Additionally, it provided an evidence-base to support the\u000a      Justice Directorate's development of the Scottish Government Reducing\u000a        Reoffending Programme, with McNeill being invited to join the\u000a      Programme Board to contribute his expertise [8].\u000a    The Scottish Government has subsequently invested &#163;10m in a change fund\u000a      to provide more people leaving prison with mentors, and funded `Positive\u000a      Prisons? Positive Futures...', which represents the views of people with\u000a      convictions in policy-making and service development. Both initiatives\u000a      reflect the DesKE ethos around engagement, dialogue and co-production of\u000a      knowledge.\u000a    In addition, McNeill was recently appointed to the Review Board for the\u000a      Scottish Prison Service (SPS), which is currently redesigning its\u000a      operating philosophy and approach around desistance principles. SPS, which\u000a      employs approximately 4200 staff who work with the 8000 people detained in\u000a      custody in Scotland, recently commissioned SCCJR to review and develop\u000a      models of staff training (at all career stages and for all grades) to\u000a      support desistance.\u000a    Northern Ireland (NI) Prison Service:\u000a      The Justice Minister for Northern Ireland commissioned a comprehensive\u000a      review of Northern Ireland's Prison Service in 2010, resulting in the\u000a      Northern Ireland Prison Review Team's Final Report in October\u000a      2011. McNeill was invited to serve as the sole academic member of the\u000a      high-level Review Team in order to contribute his knowledge of desistance,\u000a      reintegration and penal reform. The Final Report outlines the vision for\u000a      the `New Prison System' which is to be organised around 3 key objectives,\u000a      including: `Desistance: a wider picture' [9]. Following the start\u000a      of the Strategic Efficiency and Effectiveness Programme,\u000a      established by the NIPS to implement the Review Team's recommendations,\u000a      the Justice Minister outlined plans in March 2013 for a &#163;202m investment\u000a      into reforming the NIPS; a significant feature of his announcement on the\u000a      funding was the need to fund reforms that support desistance by `changing\u000a        attitudes towards offender management through positive engagement and\u000a        interaction' (see: NIPS Press Release: Link).\u000a    Internationally, the research has exercised similar influences on\u000a      penal policy and practice. McNeill has been invited to lead DesKE\u000a      workshops in mainland Europe, Australia and the USA. For example, after a\u000a      workshop in Adelaide, probation practitioners in Mobilong Prison rethought\u000a      the ways that they communicate with people with convictions during\u000a      one-to-one and group intervention conversations. The Manager of Offender\u000a      Development for the prison noted that, in stressing the importance of\u000a      creating an identity alternative to that of `criminal', McNeill's research\u000a      greatly assisted workers in framing their conversations with prisoners in\u000a      new ways [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Glasgow research on desistance from crime and reintegration\u000a      has contributed powerfully to a paradigm shift in approaches to offender\u000a      rehabilitation, resulting in significant reforms of penal policy and\u000a      practice. By fostering and sustaining relationships with criminal justice\u000a      policymakers and stakeholders, the researchers catalysed a number of\u000a      meaningful impacts. These included significant shifts in rehabilitation\u000a      policy in all three UK jurisdictions; the delivery of a new practice\u000a      skills model by the National Offender Management Service of England and\u000a      Wales, and the ongoing redesign of service provision and prison staff\u000a      training in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

University of Glasgow researchers from the Scottish Centre for\u000a      Crime and Justice Research (SCCJR), led by Fergus McNeill (Professor of\u000a      Criminology and Social Work since 2008; UoG staff since 1998), have worked\u000a      closely with policymakers, practitioners and reform groups on issues\u000a      relating to desistance and `offender management' in several jurisdictions.\u000a    Desistance Paradigm:\u000a      In the course of his criminological scholarship on `offender supervision'\u000a      over the last 15 years, McNeill showed that the combination of a punitive\u000a      turn in UK Government policy and legislation and the managerialisation of\u000a      public services changed the tenor of probation practice from one which was\u000a      concerned with the welfare of people for whom it had supervisory\u000a      responsibility, to one that prioritised public protection and the delivery\u000a      of punishments. McNeill's work exposed the paradox that, as penal\u000a      discourses and practices shifted focus from rehabilitation and support to\u000a      control, regulation, and surveillance, the likelihood of reducing\u000a      reoffending and supporting desistance diminished.\u000a    McNeill's work went on to highlight the policy and practice implications\u000a      of adopting an alternative `desistance-based' approach. The outputs which\u000a      have had key impacts on policy and practice include: 21st\u000a        Century Social Work: Reducing Reoffending &#8212; Key Practice Skills, Towards\u000a        Effective Practice in Offender Supervision and, with Weaver,\u000a      (Glasgow School of Social Work, Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde) Changing\u000a        Lives? Desistance Research and Offender Management (`the Changing\u000a        Lives? report').\u000a    In developing and advancing the case for a desistance paradigm in these\u000a      reports and other academic outputs, McNeill proposed that developments in\u000a      penal policy and practice must recognise, among other things: the\u000a      importance of listening to and working with `service users'; the ways in\u000a      which relationships matter to people under supervision and in prison; the\u000a      strengths and resources that people bring to the process of change; the\u000a      need for an individualised and relational approach to supporting positive\u000a      change; the importance of developing hope and a sense of agency; the need\u000a      to work at developing social, as well as human, capital and wellbeing; and\u000a      the need to develop practices and languages, thus supporting\u000a      `de-labelling'.\u000a    The research findings have continuously been disseminated to and used by\u000a      academics, policymakers, practitioners (in various sectors), as well as by\u000a      ex-offenders and their supporters. McNeill has undertaken much of this\u000a      work in collaboration with others, some of whom have been fellow SCCJR\u000a      researchers based at the University of Glasgow (Batchelor), and others\u000a      from different disciplinary backgrounds in criminology and law (including\u000a      Farrall at University of Sheffield; Burnett at University of Oxford; and\u000a      Maruna at Queen's University Belfast). McNeill's academic and professional\u000a      background in criminal justice social work has allowed him to make a\u000a      distinct contribution to synthesising theoretical perspectives and\u000a      research findings, identifying their practical implications, and\u000a      exchanging knowledge with multiple stakeholders.\u000a    DesKE:\u000a      As part of a continued commitment to stakeholder engagement, McNeill led\u000a      an ESRC-funded `Desistance Knowledge Exchange Project' between 2011\u000a      and 2012. DesKE advanced knowledge exchange between academics, policy\u000a      makers, practitioners, ex-offenders, service-users and their\u000a      families\/supporters in relation to the ways in which desistance can be\u000a      better supported through supervision and reintegration. McNeill\u000a      co-ordinated the project, working with Farrall (Sheffield), Maruna (QUB),\u000a      and Lightowler (of the Institute for Research and Innovation in Social\u000a      Services).\u000a    The researchers co-produced a documentary film entitled The Road from\u000a        Crime, which acted as a stimulus for discussions at a series of 10\u000a      stakeholder workshops, initially in Glasgow, London, Sheffield, Merseyside\u000a      and Belfast (and later around the world). The workshops facilitated the\u000a      co-production of research-informed ideas for policy and practice reform.\u000a      By August 2013, the DesKE project blog had been viewed over 60,000 times\u000a      by over 30,000 visitors; the film's webpage had been visited nearly 9,000\u000a      times and `The Road from Crime' had been viewed online\u000a      approximately 5,000 times.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23455","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Regionally: impacts on the Public Inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire\u000d\u000a        NHS Foundation Trust\u000d\u000a    Paton's research expertise led to his appointment as Chair of a large NHS\u000d\u000a      hospital trust from 2000\u000d\u000a      to 2006. Through this role, Paton was invited as an expert witness to the\u000d\u000a      Public Inquiry into Mid\u000d\u000a      Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust ('The Francis Inquiry'), reporting in\u000d\u000a      January 2013 [source 1]. In\u000d\u000a      his main evidence Paton drew on his expertise on health care systems\u000d\u000a      (publications 3 and 4) to\u000d\u000a      outline how an over-loaded policy-agenda and a culture of punitive central\u000d\u000a      control had allowed the\u000d\u000a      Mid Staffs problems to be tolerated [source 2]. The Inquiry's\u000d\u000a      recommendations (Feb. 6, 2013)\u000d\u000a      pointed squarely to these problems in the type of language used by Paton,\u000d\u000a      who was a unique\u000d\u000a      witness in that he had been active in the relevant health economy as well\u000d\u000a      as an academic\u000d\u000a      specialist in health policy [source 3].\u000d\u000a    This analysis led the Inquiry to invite recommendations not only about\u000d\u000a      the future governance and\u000d\u000a      regulation of the NHS at national and local levels but also about how and\u000d\u000a      whether government\u000d\u000a      policy was likely to aid or retard these in the pursuit of good quality of\u000d\u000a      care for patients. Paton's\u000d\u000a      ongoing research outputs concerning `policy overload' and incompatible\u000d\u000a      policies and incoherent\u000d\u000a      local and regional implementation\/management regimes have led to\u000d\u000a      continuing impact locally upon\u000d\u000a      debates and decisions.

Paton was\u000d\u000a      able to contribute to a government-initiated pause from March to June 2011\u000d\u000a      in order to review\u000d\u000a      policy, and consider the Health Bill in Parliament and its subsequent\u000d\u000a      amendment.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, Paton was an expert witness to the House of Commons Select\u000d\u000a      Committee on Health\u000d\u000a      in 2011 (Oral evidence, Tuesday, March 1; written evidence also provided),\u000d\u000a      which was significant\u000d\u000a      in the process of amendment of the then Health Bill. Paton provided\u000d\u000a      evidence about the\u000d\u000a      consequences of similar reforms (or reforms which were more limited\u000d\u000a      prototypes of those proposed\u000d\u000a      in the Health Bill), based on his research reported in Paton, 1998; 2006;\u000d\u000a      2010. This was part of the\u000d\u000a      evidence which suggested that local commissioning of health-care in the\u000d\u000a      context of `marketised'\u000d\u000a      provision had unforseen effects often opposite to that intended by\u000d\u000a      policy-makers. The report from\u000d\u000a      the Select Committee reflected some evidence of this nature and the\u000d\u000a      amended Health and Social\u000d\u000a      Care Act took on board such criticisms [Source 4].\u000d\u000a    Paton has been an occasional adviser to the Labour Party and to\u000d\u000a      Ministers\/Shadow Ministers over\u000d\u000a      a number of years (1994-5; 2005; 2012-date). Specifically, Paton's impact\u000d\u000a      on more recent policy\u000d\u000a      debate was in terms of the warnings as to inadequately-thought-out or\u000d\u000a      poorly-implemented health\u000d\u000a      service reform [Source 5].\u000d\u000a    More broadly, Paton has also contributed to a change in the national\u000d\u000a      longer-term scope of debate\u000d\u000a      about NHS reform. His academic research has been disseminated to a broader\u000d\u000a      professional and\u000d\u000a      policy-focused public through commissioned articles in the British Medical\u000d\u000a      Journal (which also\u000d\u000a      contributed to the evidence of the failure of commissioning in the English\u000d\u000a      NHS to be cost-effective\u000d\u000a      or even effective, and to the review of policy by the Coalition\u000d\u000a      government), Public Servant, the\u000d\u000a      British Journal of General Practice and the Health Service Journal\u000d\u000a      [sources 6 and 7]. Between\u000d\u000a      2010 and 2012 he has written regular articles for Public Servant, a\u000d\u000a      journal read by senior\u000d\u000a      politicians (including ministers), civil servants and policy makers\u000d\u000a      [source 8].\u000d\u000a    Internationally: the EU; WHO; Shanghai Pudong Health Bureau\u000d\u000a    Paton's scholarship on international health service reform and\u000d\u000a      marketisation has contributed to\u000d\u000a      policy debates and practice about the consequences of reform in different\u000d\u000a      national contexts. Two\u000d\u000a      EU-funded research projects which Paton directed have had their main\u000d\u000a      impact from 2009 in\u000d\u000a      informing debate about the direction of the EU Health Directive. The\u000d\u000a      findings from these projects\u000d\u000a      have pointed to the difficulty of introducing a Single European Market for\u000d\u000a      health services and these\u000d\u000a      difficulties have broadly been accepted within EU, thus health has been\u000d\u000a      further exempted from\u000d\u000a      general pro-competitive policy under the Single European Market. The then\u000d\u000a      Health policy director\u000d\u000a      at the European Commission and members of the EU High Level Committee on\u000d\u000a      Health welcomed\u000d\u000a      the findings [sources 9 and 10]. Paton's primary impact here is through\u000d\u000a      working collaboratively with\u000d\u000a      health policy researchers across Europe to engage policy makers with the\u000d\u000a      need to take into\u000d\u000a      account the intricacies and consequences of policy reform.\u000d\u000a    Additionally, work on the particular `market reforms' within member\u000d\u000a      states has led to influence upon\u000d\u000a      EU policy-making &#8212; primarily, in giving pause to the previously-strong\u000d\u000a      idea that member-states'\u000d\u000a      market reforms and EU `market reform' were in harmony and were the source\u000d\u000a      of positive lessons\u000d\u000a      for each other. The EU has become more cautious both about encouraging\u000d\u000a      market reform in\u000d\u000a      member states and about using the SEM indiscriminately or inadvertently in\u000d\u000a      health.\u000d\u000a    Paton's expertise on market reform, as established through his\u000d\u000a      collaborative EU work, has led to\u000d\u000a      recent advisory roles for World Health Organisation (2009-2013) and the\u000d\u000a      Health Bureaux in\u000d\u000a      Shanghai and Pudong to raise awareness among policy makers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners on the problems\u000d\u000a      caused by `marketisation' in public health systems [sources 11 and 12].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Paton's research on health policy and the politics of health policy has\u000d\u000a      had specific impacts at local,\u000d\u000a      national and international levels between 2008 and 2013.

This\u000d\u000a      research has traced the ideological nature of policy as well as intended\u000d\u000a      and unforeseen\u000d\u000a      consequences of market reform in the NHS. Paton's earlier work (1993-1997)\u000d\u000a      primarily used\u000d\u000a      quantitative analysis to examine the 1990s internal market and he then\u000d\u000a      later linked this to his\u000d\u000a      qualitative evaluation of New Labour's health policy from 1997 to 2010,\u000d\u000a      drawing conclusions about\u000d\u000a      the consequences of markets, and the similarities and dissimilarities\u000d\u000a      between the NHS market in\u000d\u000a      the 1990s and the 2000s. Specifically, Paton has undertaken this research\u000d\u000a      in three key phases,\u000d\u000a      examining: first, the nature, costs and certain outcomes of the UK\u000d\u000a      internal market in the NHS,\u000d\u000a      1991-97, funded by the Nuffield Trust from 1993-1997 (Paton et\u000d\u000a          al., 1998); second, the nature,\u000d\u000a      costs and outputs of the English NHS reforms from 2001 to 2006; and third,\u000d\u000a      the characteristics of\u000d\u000a      the English NHS reform proposals, enactments and implementation,\u000d\u000a      2010-2013, resulting in the\u000d\u000a      Health and Social Care Act of 2012, which Paton analysed with reference to\u000d\u000a      lessons from the\u000d\u000a      above.\u000d\u000a    The intended outcomes from market reform have ranged from greater\u000d\u000a      technical efficiency in the\u000d\u000a      NHS (1991-97) through greater choice and\/or local commissioning by GPs\u000d\u000a      (2002-date). Yet: (1)\u000d\u000a      the unforeseen outcomes of `market reforms' have been due to (i)\u000d\u000a      problematic assumptions about\u000d\u000a      the economic prerequisites for success of `markets'; (ii) unattainable and\u000d\u000a      under-examined political\u000d\u000a      conditions for success; (iii) the costs of the `internal market' being\u000d\u000a      significantly underestimated; and\u000d\u000a      (iv) alleged advantages of the market not materializing (Paton et\u000d\u000a          al., 1998). Additionally, (2) the\u000d\u000a      failure to achieve `value for money' from New Labour's NHS reforms has\u000d\u000a      been because of an\u000d\u000a      `incoherent market' and the incompatibility of various market reforms with\u000d\u000a      other national policy\u000d\u000a      initiatives (Paton, 2006). There has been failure at successive\u000d\u000a      decision-points when health sector\u000d\u000a      reform was initiated (i.e. new policy) to use existing research, either\u000d\u000a      positively (i.e. to adopt\u000d\u000a      successful models) or negatively (i.e. to avoid policy which was likely to\u000d\u000a      fail) (Paton, 2010; 2013).\u000d\u000a    As Scientific Director\/lead researcher (designing methods and writing key\u000d\u000a      outputs) of two major EU\u000d\u000a      research projects (1998-2000; 1997-2002) Paton has carried out\u000d\u000a      collaborative research on the\u000d\u000a      relationship between the single European market and the health systems and\u000d\u000a      `market reforms' of\u000d\u000a      member-states. The 1998-2000 project, on market reform within the\u000d\u000a      individual EU member states\u000d\u000a      was funded by DG Sanco (European Commission) and had a steering group of 5\u000d\u000a      (chaired by\u000d\u000a      Paton). The 1997-2002 project, on the effect of EU law, regulations and\u000d\u000a      directives concerning the\u000d\u000a      `four freedoms' under the Single European Market (SEM) upon the\u000d\u000a      health-care systems of the\u000d\u000a      member states, was funded by DG Research (European Commission) and had a\u000d\u000a      steering group of\u000d\u000a      9, chaired by Paton. The findings of these projects were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      market reforms to individual health-care systems had not produced\u000d\u000a        empirically significant\u000d\u000a        improvements in effectiveness, equity or efficiency and were not capable\u000d\u000a        of generating\u000d\u000a        lessons that could be generalised and implemented at EU level or applied\u000d\u000a        to diverse\u000d\u000a        Health service systems within the EU;\u000d\u000a      using generic Single European Market law as the basis for health-care\u000d\u000a        policy-making at EU\u000d\u000a        level (especially `ad hoc' decisions by the European Court of Justice)\u000d\u000a        created unforeseen\u000d\u000a        incentives such as shortage of clinicians in poorer countries, inequity\u000d\u000a        in access to care and\u000d\u000a        unsustainable `healthcare travel.'\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23484","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    National Impacts: policy and the landscape of housing and care\u000d\u000a        provision for older people\u000d\u000a      Described as `pioneering' by key stakeholders, research by Bernard et\u000d\u000a        al. on Berryhill was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in highlighting the significance of suitable housing and care\u000d\u000a      to the wellbeing of older\u000d\u000a      people and to the shift in understanding and approach to provision by\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and\u000d\u000a      stakeholders alike, evident in the last decade.

The research by Bernard et\u000d\u000a        al. led to a series of\u000d\u000a      practice recommendations and organisational changes at Berryhill itself\u000d\u000a      [source 8], as well as\u000d\u000a      identifying specific issues that ExtraCare addressed in the building of\u000d\u000a      subsequent villages.\u000d\u000a    At Berryhill, street meetings were reorganised to better facilitate\u000d\u000a      democratic decision making;\u000d\u000a      issues around death and bereavement were addressed by having an\u000d\u000a      anniversary book to\u000d\u000a      commemorate those who had died, together with regular staff training from\u000d\u000a      an experienced\u000d\u000a      bereavement counsellor; and ExtraCare now have wellbeing advisors in each\u000d\u000a      village and hope to\u000d\u000a      have Cruse bereavement counsellors too. The identified need to support\u000d\u000a      residents' mental health,\u000d\u000a      and especially to support those with dementia, led to ExtraCare funding\u000d\u000a      further research and,\u000d\u000a      subsequently, to providing a member of staff at each village to undertake\u000d\u000a      and support individual\u000d\u000a      care plans. This has significantly reduced the move on rate of such\u000d\u000a      individuals. The research also\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the importance of feelings of belonging to and settling in,\u000d\u000a      and villages now run a\u000d\u000a      `friends' scheme 13 months prior to opening to enable future residents to\u000d\u000a      be part of the decision-making\u000d\u000a      about the development of the village. They also offer a `friends\u000d\u000a      membership' once a village\u000d\u000a      is opened to those considering moving; enabling them to participate in\u000d\u000a      activities and develop social\u000d\u000a      connections with those already there. The design of new villages has\u000d\u000a      included improved\u000d\u000a      accessibility by installing automatic doors at the main entrance and\u000d\u000a      between the village and\u000d\u000a      accommodation areas, and making each residential apartment slightly\u000d\u000a      bigger.\u000d\u000a    The rigorous academic quality of the research led the sector, including\u000d\u000a      ExtraCare, to realise that\u000d\u000a      research in itself was important to future investment planning. ExtraCare\u000d\u000a      are funding a Keele PhD\u000d\u000a      studentship (2012-15), exploring to what extent Berryhill can now be\u000d\u000a      considered `age-friendly'.

Initial research (1997-1999) compared a\u000d\u000a      small age-segregated housing\u000d\u000a      project with a community-based sample of older people.

This was followed in 1998 by\u000d\u000a      pilot work in Berryhill Retirement\u000d\u000a      Village in Stoke-on-Trent which underpinned a successful bid to the then\u000d\u000a      National Lottery Charities\u000d\u000a      Board.\u000d\u000a    The resulting study of Berryhill (Bernard et al., 2004), carried\u000d\u000a      out from 2000-2003, was the first UK\u000d\u000a      research to examine a purpose-built retirement village aimed at\u000d\u000a      accommodating a local, working-class\u000d\u000a      population. It yielded important insights into the extent to which an\u000d\u000a      environment of this nature\u000d\u000a      was able to meet the evolving social needs and expectations of residents\u000d\u000a      over time; revealed the\u000d\u000a      positive impacts the village had on people's health, identity and\u000d\u000a      well-being; and uncovered what it\u000d\u000a      was like to live and work in such an age-segregated setting. The key\u000d\u000a      findings from this pioneering\u000d\u000a      study show that: (i) Berryhill worked well for its predominantly\u000d\u000a      lower-income residents who came\u000d\u000a      from an urban area that was significantly below the national average on\u000d\u000a      key indicators for health\u000d\u000a      and well-being; (ii) although their health status was generally poor,\u000d\u000a      substantial proportions of\u000d\u000a      respondents felt that life had got much better since moving to Berryhill,\u000d\u000a      and this improvement was\u000d\u000a      maintained over time; and (iii) the safety and security offered by having\u000d\u000a      care and support on one\u000d\u000a      site was particularly valued. Whilst capable of delivering significant\u000d\u000a      improvements to the quality of\u000d\u000a      life of older people and providing an environment in which to `age well',\u000d\u000a      the study also articulated\u000d\u000a      the many challenges around mixing `fit and frail' older people for all\u000d\u000a      involved, and the wider lessons\u000d\u000a      which could be drawn by developers, policy-makers and practitioners\u000d\u000a      wishing to develop similar\u000d\u000a      schemes (Bernard et al., 2004; 2007).\u000d\u000a    The researchers at Keele have continued to attract competitive funding\u000d\u000a      for work on other purpose-built\u000d\u000a      retirement villages: in 2005, Bernard, Bartlam, Scharf and Sim were\u000d\u000a      awarded the tender to\u000d\u000a      undertake a study of Denham Garden Village in Buckinghamshire. Carried out\u000d\u000a      from 2006 to 2010,\u000d\u000a      the Longitudinal Study of Ageing in a Retirement Community (LARC) explored\u000d\u000a      the effects of the\u000d\u000a      2001 redevelopment of Denham Garden Village by Anchor Trust (the largest\u000d\u000a      provider of retirement\u000d\u000a      housing and care for older people in England) (Bernard et al.,\u000d\u000a      2012). In addition to furthering our\u000d\u000a      understanding of what it is like to live and work in these environments,\u000d\u000a      this study highlights the\u000d\u000a      need for much greater clarity from developers and policy-makers around how\u000d\u000a      such age-segregated\u000d\u000a      environments may fit with the current policy emphasis on creating\u000d\u000a      age-friendly cities and\u000d\u000a      communities (Bernard et al., 2012; Liddle et al., 2013).\u000d\u000a    The totality of this work on retirement communities thus draws attention\u000d\u000a      to enduring questions in\u000d\u000a      respect of their capacity to support ageing in place; the accessibility of\u000d\u000a      local amenities and\u000d\u000a      activities in the wider neighbourhoods; opportunities, if any, for\u000d\u000a      intergenerational interactions; and\u000d\u000a      the training of staff. Those responsible for developing such communities\u000d\u000a      need genuine and explicit\u000d\u000a      commitments from all levels in their organisations (managers, staff and\u000d\u000a      residents) if they are to be\u000d\u000a      able to engage in the necessary cycle of planning, implementation,\u000d\u000a      evaluation and continual\u000d\u000a      improvement, and especially if they wish to be a crucial part of the\u000d\u000a      rapidly developing age-friendly\u000d\u000a      agenda.\u000d\u000a    Researchers involved: Professor Miriam Bernard; Dr Bernadette\u000d\u000a      Bartlam &#8212; Research Fellow and\u000d\u000a      Lecturer; Professor Simon Biggs (at Keele until 2004); Jennifer Liddle &#8212;\u000d\u000a      Research\u000d\u000a      Assistant\/Associate; Professor Judith Phillips; Professor Thomas\u000d\u000a        Scharf; and Professor Julius Sim.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23615","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In the UK alone, three-quarters of men in the 35-65 age range are\u000d\u000a      overweight; a third of these are obese. The UK government estimates that\u000d\u000a      weight problems already cost the UK &#163;1.6 billion per year, but that this\u000d\u000a      could rise to &#163;50 billion per year by 2050, with men classed as obese\u000d\u000a      rising from 25% to 60%. Obese people who lose just 5-10% of their body\u000d\u000a      weight can significantly reduce their risk of ill health. Football\u000a        Fans in Training (FFIT) was developed in response to the fact that\u000d\u000a      overweight and obese men are notoriously difficult to engage in weight\u000d\u000a      management programmes. Between 2010 and 2013, the FFIT programme has\u000d\u000a      successfully helped around 2000 obese or overweight men, and has had\u000d\u000a      local, national and international impact.\u000d\u000a    Improved health and wellbeing\u000d\u000a      Men taking part in the feasibility study lost an average of 5.0kg (or\u000d\u000a      4.6%) of their body weight over the course of the programme. Almost half\u000d\u000a      of participants (45.5%) achieved the weight loss target (5-10%) that has\u000d\u000a      been shown to reduce obesity-related health risks, and many (39.5%)\u000d\u000a      maintained this to 12 months. One participant explained that his personal\u000d\u000a      risk of diabetes had been reduced by his participation in FFIT:\u000d\u000a    \"I knew before the course that I was overweight and... going\u000d\u000a        `doonhill' [downhill] &#8212; so that was a huge win for me.\"\u000d\u000a    As well as reporting increases in physical activity levels and improved\u000d\u000a      eating habits, many men taking part in FFIT experienced great improvements\u000d\u000a      in physical and mental wellbeing. For example, one man talked about\u000d\u000a      playing with his young children:\u000d\u000a    \"It's just quality time that I didn't have, because I didn't have a\u000d\u000a        life, you know, [I was] just coming home from work, working all hours,\u000d\u000a        because I never had the energy.... So it's been lifechanging for me.\"\u000d\u000a    The project has generated media interest locally, nationally and UK-wide.\u000d\u000a      In autumn 2011, BBC Scotland followed the progress of the men who took\u000d\u000a      part in FFIT at three clubs: Celtic, Dunfermline Athletic and St Johnstone\u000d\u000a      FCs. The resultant TV documentary was broadcast on BBC2 on 19th\u000d\u000a      February 2012 at 18.45, publicising the programme to a wide audience. It\u000d\u000a      generated a waiting list of 226 men to take part in FFIT (in August 2012),\u000d\u000a      and led to additional interest from other organisations (see below).\u000d\u000a    Influenced practice leading to improved services\u000d\u000a      The research team has worked closely with the Scottish Premier League\u000d\u000a      (SPL) Trust (now Scottish Professional Football League [SPFL] Trust) to\u000d\u000a      keep the Scottish Government fully informed of the progress of the FFIT\u000d\u000a      project. This collaboration has been successful in securing ongoing\u000d\u000a      funding for programme delivery, allowing the SPFL Trust to begin expanding\u000d\u000a      into other professional football clubs in Scotland. Feedback from the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government indicates that they particularly value the programme's\u000d\u000a      ability to engage `hard to reach' middle-aged males, as well as the\u000d\u000a      rigorous evaluation framework and firm research base provided by the\u000d\u000a      University of Glasgow expertise. The Creating Health Team (Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government Office of the Chief Medical Officer\/Public Health Directorate)\u000d\u000a      wrote:\u000d\u000a    The work is undoubtedly an area we will wish to examine as the obesity\u000d\u000a        route map is reviewed, particularly given the programme's ability to\u000d\u000a        attract equal participants across income groups. It is also an area we\u000d\u000a        believe worthy of exploration in its use in tackling smoking and\u000d\u000a        excessive drinking where the subject group particularly amongst those at\u000d\u000a        the lower end of the socioeconomic scale continue to be difficult to\u000d\u000a        engage let alone positively affect.\u000d\u000a    A knowledge exchange seminar with NHS Adult Obesity leaders on 6th\u000d\u000a      December 2012 attracted interest from NHS Weight Management Services in\u000d\u000a      the Lothian and Grampian regions. In a letter to the research team, the\u000d\u000a      Clinical Service Lead of Lothian Weight Management Service indicated his\u000d\u000a      intention to extend the programme:\u000d\u000a    We feel that FFIT could help engage some of our patients in weight\u000d\u000a        loss and lifestyle improvements in a way that has not been possible\u000d\u000a        through our standard weight management programmes... We are currently\u000d\u000a        working to secure funding for additional programmes... we hope that our\u000d\u000a        involvement with FFIT will further increase its impact by making it\u000d\u000a        available to different population groups.\u000d\u000a    Influenced policy and practice in secure institutions\u000d\u000a      Staff from Perth Prison and Carstairs State Hospital approached the\u000d\u000a      research team following the BBC broadcast to investigate adapting and\u000d\u000a      delivering FFIT to inmates, patients and shift-work employees at their\u000d\u000a      institutions. The pilot delivery at Perth Prison began on 5 February 2013,\u000d\u000a      and Perth Prison has already reported its satisfaction with the progress\u000d\u000a      of prisoners taking part:\u000d\u000a    Many of them have started coming to the gym for the first time and are\u000d\u000a        succeeding in cutting down on some of the unhealthy snacks they can\u000d\u000a        purchase from the prison canteen. They are also spreading word about the\u000d\u000a        benefits of FFIT to other prisoners, and we are confident that the\u000d\u000a        programme will be sustainable going forward.

University of Glasgow researchers have led a multidisciplinary\u000d\u000a      team which has harnessed the personal connection, loyalty and attachment\u000d\u000a      many men feel to the professional football club they support to attract\u000d\u000a      them to an evidence-based weight loss and healthy lifestyle programme,\u000d\u000a      Football Fans in Training (FFIT).\u000d\u000a    FFIT consists of 12 weekly sessions (with light-touch post-programme\u000d\u000a      follow-up through email prompts and a reunion session) delivered to groups\u000d\u000a      of men by community coaches at the home stadia of Scotland's top\u000d\u000a      professional football clubs. FFIT is `gender-sensitised' for men in terms\u000d\u000a      of context, content and delivery. The context is the traditionally male\u000d\u000a      environment of football clubs; content consists of accessible information,\u000d\u000a      discussion sessions and materials `branded' with club insignia; and the\u000d\u000a      delivery takes the form of participative, peer-supported learning which\u000d\u000a      encourages the use of humour and informal conversation to facilitate\u000d\u000a      discussion of sensitive subjects.\u000d\u000a    FFIT is delivered free of charge to participants by community coaching\u000d\u000a      staff employed by clubs and trained over two days by the research team, to\u000d\u000a      groups of up to 30 overweight\/obese men (participant: coach ratio 15:1).\u000d\u000a      Participants aim to achieve 5-10% weight loss and to increase physical\u000d\u000a      activity to 45 minutes of moderate activity on most days of the week.

The pilot trial\u000d\u000a      (reported in January 2012) showed that FFIT was successful in attracting\u000d\u000a      high-risk men: most were obese, with a mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of\u000d\u000a      35kg\/m2, and the majority (68%) had elevated blood pressure.\u000d\u000a      Unlike many health promotion programmes, FFIT was also successful in\u000d\u000a      recruiting participants from across the socio-economic spectrum.\u000d\u000a    The team at the University of Glasgow, led by Professors Kate Hunt and\u000d\u000a      Sally Wyke and Dr Cindy Gray, conducted a randomised, controlled trial\u000d\u000a      (RCT) of FFIT, the first-ever RCT of an innovative health promotion\u000d\u000a      intervention in a professional football club setting, from June 2011\u000d\u000a        to December 2013.

He was one of the authors of an on-line `Manifesto for a new\u000a      engaged practice' which\u000a      was printed in hardcopy in 2007 within the book International Social\u000a        Work and the Radical\u000a        Tradition. The Manifesto has been widely quoted and has been\u000a      translated into Greek, Cantonese,\u000a      Spanish, Russian and Japanese.\u000a    The Manifesto argued three things. First, that good social work helps\u000a      people to address a range of\u000a      problems and traumas in their lives. Good social work is, therefore a\u000a      `profession worth fighting for'.\u000a      Second, most entrants to social work are drawn to it as a `helping'\u000a      profession committed to a range\u000a      of values associated with meeting human need, social justice and equality\u000a      (values that are all\u000a      enshrined in the international definition of social work). But that third,\u000a      the growing reality of welfare\u000a      transformations, marketization and an increasingly `neo-liberal' social\u000a      policy regime produces a\u000a      `disconnect' within the profession where work expectations and\u000a      requirements increasingly clash\u000a      with the professional and ethical commitments of practitioners in the\u000a      field.\u000a    Lavalette's work therefore exposes the `gap' between the value base and\u000a      ethical commitments of\u000a      practitioners and the restrictions placed upon frontline workers by\u000a      present social work regimes and\u000a      policy requirements. These concerns have also led him to explore\u000a      `alternative social work futures'.\u000a    Lavalette's research has included writings on the impact of marketization\u000a      on children's and adult\u000a      services. In 2009 a short book `Social Work After baby P' saw a\u000a      joint authored piece by Lavalette\u000a      commented upon by a range of academics, practitioners, service users and\u000a      national trade union\u000a      figures. The aim of the book was to open up debate about the social and\u000a      public causes that were\u000a      part of the hidden story behind the death of Peter Connelly. The success\u000a      of the book and its\u000a      unusual style (of bringing academics, practitioners and service users\u000a      together to debate key topics)\u000a      has now been taken up in a series published by Policy Press (with\u000a      Lavalette as one of the series\u000a      editors). Six books have been planned (on poverty, ethics,\u000a      personalisation, children's services,\u000a      mental health and adult social care) with Lavalette co-authoring the book\u000a      on the marketisation of\u000a      adult social care.\u000a    Lavalette was also centrally involved in organising a conference to mark\u000a      the 35th anniversary of\u000a      Bailey and Brake's classic book `Radical Social Work' and produced an\u000a      edited collection Radical\u000a        Social Work Today: Social Work at the Crossroads (Policy Press)\u000a      which drew links between radical\u000a      social work of the 1970s and what has sometimes been termed `second wave\u000a      radicalism' in social\u000a      work today.\u000a    Lavalette's own work would question the notion of the present being a\u000a      `second wave' of radicalism.\u000a      One of the themes in his work is that there has always been a `radical\u000a      kernel' within social work. To\u000a      establish this he has produced a number of books that look at radical\u000a      examples of social work\u000a      internationally and historically. Further he has recently developed the\u000a      concept of `popular social\u000a      work' to account for examples where communities and social movements\u000a      address individual and\u000a      collective trauma in innovative and dynamic ways &#8212; in the process pointing\u000a      out potential social\u000a      work developments and alternative approaches to social problems.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23979","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research findings uncovered an important area for practice\u000a      development. The impact of the work has been, and continues to be,\u000a      considerable at policy and practice levels, while also raising public\u000a      awareness of the needs of older adults at night in care homes.\u000a    Policy\u000a      In 2009 the researchers were funded (by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation)\u000a      to establish a working group with representatives from each of the UK care\u000a      regulatory bodies. This group worked over four meetings to translate the\u000a      research findings into recommendations and actions for practice. The most\u000a      practical of these is a checklist which informs practice and raises\u000a      awareness of night-time care. This checklist is targeted at care home\u000a      inspectors and care home managers. The implementation of the checklist is\u000a      most evident in its use by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) (England and\u000a      Wales). The CQC have used the checklist to inform changes and additions to\u000a      their regulation and inspection policy\/guidance, for use by all care home\u000a      inspectors (CQC Working Group 2009 &#8212; see below). The checklist is also\u000a      freely available on their webpage of resources for care home managers to\u000a      raise awareness among managers about inspectors' expectations in relation\u000a      to night-time care quality [5.1].\u000a    The study was also presented at the Scottish Policy Innovation Forum in\u000a      2008 to an audience of people responsible for making and implementing\u000a      policy.\u000a    The Scottish Care Inspectorate reviewed the work and the recommendations\u000a      internally, then left the use of the checklist to the choice of individual\u000a      inspectors rather than taking the more systematic approach recommended by\u000a      the English CQC.\u000a    In 2009 findings from the study were submitted by the Joseph Rowntree\u000a      Foundation to the Department of Health in response to their consultation\u000a      informing the national dementia strategy in England.\u000a    Practice\u000a      Care home inspectors in England and Wales now use the checklist developed\u000a      as part of this project. In 2011, the National Mental Health Development\u000a      Unit incorporated specific guidance, arising from this research, on night\u000a      time care for older people in care homes with delirium, dementia and\u000a      depression [5.2].\u000a    The study produced materials made freely available to care practitioners,\u000a      including a set of posters and a postcard, as well as a short piece of\u000a      drama (`Night and Day' audio-play with Forum Interactive), with\u000a      facilitation guidelines which are used in training for carers. In\u000a      addition, a summary of the findings of the study and links to the training\u000a      materials has been widely published on a range of websites which provide\u000a      information and training to social care professionals in the public and\u000a      voluntary sectors and informal carers both nationally and internationally.\u000a      These include the Voluntary Health Scotland website, communitycare.co.uk,\u000a      connect-in-care.net, and skillsforcare.org.uk, and the International\u000a      Association of Homes and Services for the Ageing (IAHSA) global ageing\u000a      network. The study has also informed guidance provided by some of the\u000a      leading charities and social care information networks, such as the Social\u000a      Care Institute for Excellence and the Housing Learning and Improvement\u000a      Network which inform social care practices in the UK [5.3]. The findings\u000a      of the study have also been disseminated to social care practitioners\u000a      internationally, for example, through the Aged Care INsite journal [5.4]\u000a      and Aged Care Channel in Australia.\u000a    Further dissemination and practical advice for practitioners is also now\u000a      available in the book Providing good care at night for older people\u000a      (Kerr and Wilkinson), which was launched in November 2010 at the UK\u000a      Dementia Congress and has since been translated into German and Polish\u000a      [5.5]. The Polish edition sold 200 copies in the first 6 months (April &#8212;\u000a      Sept 2013) [5.6].\u000a    Public\u000a      In addition to the impact of the research in policy and practice, the\u000a      findings have also raised public awareness of the importance of night-time\u000a      care for older adults in care homes through press releases and coverage in\u000a      the media. In 2008 the research was reported in The Guardian newspaper,\u000a      Scotsman and Evening News (Edinburgh), and on the BBC News Channel and STV\u000a      [5.7, 5.8].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research findings have informed the development of training and support\u000a      for care home inspectors and toolkits for use by caring professionals, all\u000a      of which are provided through the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website.\u000a      Findings have also been disseminated nationally and internationally\u000a      through a book aimed at practitioners and policy makers that has now been\u000a      published in German and Polish and is selling strongly in Australia and\u000a      the USA.

In addition, standards specific to the provision of night-time\u000a      care are notably absent from both legislation and policy guidance. A\u000a      review of the literature indicated a need to improve understanding of\u000a      night-time care practices and for more explicit guidance on standards of\u000a      care at night.\u000a    The research was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation over a series\u000a      of three grants (2006-2010, &#163;90k total). The work was led by Wilkinson\u000a      (PI, UoE 2001-date) (with Diana Kerr as research fellow UoE 1\/08\/2003 - 31\/12\/2008). Colm Cunningham (University of Stirling Dementia Centre) was\u000a      also involved in the first few years of the research.

In the first stage semi-structured\u000a      interviews were conducted with care home inspectors, residents, relatives\u000a      and night-time care staff, and observations of night-time care practices\u000a      in three care homes. The second stage involved action research in which\u000a      recommendations from the first stage were implemented and evaluated\u000a      through written records kept by, and interviews with, both managers and\u000a      night staff.\u000a    It was found that care staff, inspectors and relatives expressed high\u000a      levels of anxiety related to a lack of knowledge about what happens at\u000a      night and resultant worries about `what if' situations. In practice, this\u000a      anxiety &#8212; exacerbated by poor communication and low levels of staff\u000a      training and recruitment &#8212; resulted in poor night-time care practices.\u000a      Night staff were notably less well trained, supported and supervised than\u000a      day staff, yet they were working with high levels of responsibility and\u000a      accountability, often providing complex levels of care.\u000a    This action research has identified a number of key strategies that\u000a      address areas of concern and which have since had an impact on both policy\u000a      and practice:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aRegular management involvement: the provision of clear guidance\u000a        and staff supervision.\u000a      \u000aA strong emphasis on individual care: enabled through\u000a        night-time keyworkers and individualised care plans.\u000a      \u000aReduced dependence on agency and bank staff: to minimise the\u000a        workload of regular night staff and improve quality of care.\u000a      Dementia-focused and night-time appropriate training for all night\u000a          staff.\u000a      \u000aControl of noise and light levels, and other environmental\u000a          variables: such as reducing voice levels, using silent pagers for\u000a        alarm systems, and dim lights in communal spaces.\u000a      \u000aClear communication is central to all the work: all staff\u000a        should be able to communicate clearly and appropriately with residents.\u000a        Morning handover meetings should be more structured and inclusive.\u000a    \u000a    These findings have informed policy and the development of guidelines for\u000a      practice used by inspectors and care home staff.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23980","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact has five major strands, as follows:\u000d\u000a    Strand 1: The researchers have worked closely with several\u000d\u000a      parliamentary committees, including the House of Commons Public Accounts\u000d\u000a      and Treasury Committees, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee,\u000d\u000a      and the Scottish Parliament's Finance Committee, to ensure that the\u000d\u000a      research has informed legislative opinion and impacted on its\u000d\u000a      decision-making (see 5.1).

This role\u000d\u000a      involved: providing written and oral evidence to the members of the\u000d\u000a      Committee; providing advice for individual Committee members and the Chair\u000d\u000a      of the Committee; drafting, reviewing and revising the outputs from the\u000d\u000a      inquiry; and co-drafting two reports.

There is\u000d\u000a      strong evidence that the inquiry and the reports had a major impact on\u000d\u000a      policy (see 5.3). The reports received significant media coverage. In an\u000d\u000a      article on 18 July 2011 by the Public Policy Editor of the Financial\u000d\u000a      Times, the report was described as the \"most searingly critical yet from\u000d\u000a      any parliamentary committee [on the PFI]\" (p.3). In November 2011, the\u000d\u000a      government announced a \"fundamental reform\" of the PFI. In December 2011,\u000d\u000a      Geoffrey Spence, the chief executive of Infrastructure UK (the section of\u000d\u000a      the Treasury with responsibility for the PFI), told a conference organised\u000d\u000a      by Partnerships Bulletin: \"In terms of old PFI, Parliament is united in\u000d\u000a      its belief that private finance of this sort is bad value for money.

For example,\u000d\u000a      sections of the Treasury Select Committee report authored by Hellowell\u000d\u000a      (and attributed as such) called attention to (a) the high cost of private\u000d\u000a      finance in the wake of the financial crisis; (b) the high rates of return\u000d\u000a      to equity in particular as a source of excess costs; (c) the lack of a\u000d\u000a      profit-sharing mechanism and the excess profits associated with this. In\u000d\u000a      PF2, problem (a) is being addressed through a fundamental reconstruction\u000d\u000a      of the contract model and the sources of funding it is designed to\u000d\u000a      attract; problem (b) is being addressed through the use of equity\u000d\u000a      competitions and public sector equity, explicitly designed to reduce rates\u000d\u000a      of return; and problem (c) is being addressed by the introduction of\u000d\u000a      cash-sharing mechanisms relating to surplus cash generated in project\u000d\u000a      operations.\u000d\u000a    Strand 5: Hellowell's research has influenced the content of World\u000d\u000a      Bank capacity-building programmes for developing country governments on\u000d\u000a      this area of policy (see 5.5).

The approach is\u000d\u000a      multi-disciplinary, incorporating theoretical and methodological\u000d\u000a      approaches from financial economics, institutional economics, public\u000d\u000a      accounting and public health. One aim of the research has been to identify\u000d\u000a      the impact of PFI contracts on NHS costs of production and thence its\u000d\u000a      financial capacity to meet population health need. This work, undertaken\u000d\u000a      by Hellowell (Research Fellow 01\/10\/2005 to 01\/09\/10, Lecturer 01\/09\/10 to\u000d\u000a      present at UoE) and Allyson Pollock (Professor at UoE 01\/10\/2005 to\u000d\u000a      01\/01\/2010), examined: the nature of the regime by which NHS providers are\u000d\u000a      paid by NHS commissioners; the income and expenditure outcomes of NHS\u000d\u000a      providers; and the financial projections and workforce plans of NHS\u000d\u000a      providers with operational PFI contracts.\u000d\u000a    This work demonstrated that NHS organisations with PFI contracts have\u000d\u000a      higher capital costs than those without such contracts. In the context of\u000d\u000a      a funding regime that pays NHS organisations on the basis of average NHS\u000d\u000a      treatment costs, the research shows that trusts with operational PFI\u000d\u000a      hospitals are under-funded for their capital costs and are vulnerable to\u000d\u000a      financial problems. One study focused on the South London NHS Trust, which\u000d\u000a      has since been placed into administration, leading to major structural\u000d\u000a      changes within the NHS in London. The research showed that efforts by the\u000d\u000a      NHS to offset resulting gaps between income and expenditure by reducing\u000d\u000a      costs limit the service capacity of NHS providers.\u000d\u000a    A second area of research (2008-13), led by Hellowell, evaluated the\u000d\u000a      profitability of PFI contracts for the private investors involved. This\u000d\u000a      work is based on financial projections related to PFI contracts signed by\u000d\u000a      NHS organisations in England and Scotland, with documents sourced from\u000d\u000a      governments through the Freedom of Information Act. It demonstrates that\u000d\u000a      the returns to investors on PFI schemes are high compared with those on\u000d\u000a      other asset classes with a similar level of risk, and highlights features\u000d\u000a      of the marketplace and the policy\/regulatory framework which give rise to\u000d\u000a      inefficiency. This work also identifies the impact of the financial crisis\u000d\u000a      on the cost of PFI. Using financial projections relating to recent PFI\u000d\u000a      hospital contracts, the work identifies the additional cost of private\u000d\u000a      finance, relative to public finance, in the post-2008 financial\u000d\u000a      environment. For example, the additional cost of using private finance on\u000d\u000a      a project commissioned by the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University\u000d\u000a      Hospital is identified at &#163;175 million (in Net Present Value terms).\u000d\u000a    A third element of the work, undertaken by Hellowell (2009-12),\u000d\u000a      identified the extent to which private sector efficiencies in the\u000d\u000a      operational elements of the PFI model (e.g., construction, facilities\u000d\u000a      management, service provision) have offset the higher cost of capital. A\u000d\u000a      systematic literature review demonstrated that the costs of operational\u000d\u000a      tasks are approximately equal between PFI and non-PFI projects and\u000d\u000a      facilities. This provided strong evidence that the additional cost of\u000d\u000a      private capital sourced through the PFI programme represents a significant\u000d\u000a      additional cost burden from the perspective of the NHS purchaser.\u000d\u000a    In summary, the work has evaluated (i) the additional cost of private\u000d\u000a      finance, (ii) the sources of the additional cost, and (iii) the\u000d\u000a      implications of this cost for NHS. In so doing, it has made an important\u000d\u000a      contribution to our understanding of this important component of public\u000d\u000a      policy.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23981","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Impact on individual practice\u000d    Much of the immediate impact from the work came from the active\u000d        dissemination and brokerage roles undertaken by the practitioner\u000d      researchers who formed the focus of the project activities.

Scottish Borders has incorporated a\u000d      Practitioner Research Project report into a service review. Their leaflets\u000d      have been re-designed and methods of gathering service user feedback\u000d      routinely have been explored. In Midlothian a training course for\u000d      employees on participation in child protection is being developed. In\u000d      Edinburgh a Practitioner Research Project (PRP) report has been included\u000d      in the induction pack for new social workers, and in post-induction\u000d      training. (5.3) The PRP has also helped one of the\u000d      practitioner-researchers to design a course for staff on working with\u000d      `resistant and involuntary' service users. This ran in 2010 and was well\u000d      evaluated by practitioners who attended.\u000d    Usefulness of project outputs\u000d    Outputs from the project have proved to be particularly useful and\u000d      relevant to practitioners, as the following exchanges indicate:\u000d    \"Last week I came across the wee leaflet [Good Practice Guide] you put\u000d        together from your work around engaging with involuntary clients....

The grant awarded was &#163;100k (of\u000d      which &#163;20k was contributed by six participating local authorities). Grant\u000d      holders were Wilkinson (at Edinburgh since 2001) and M Smith (2005). Cree\u000d      (1991), Whyte (1984), McGhee, and Hunter (1979) now Hon. Fellow [retired\u000d      2011]) were involved in supporting practitioner research activity\u000d      throughout the REF period. The project ran from November 2009 until\u000d      February 2011.\u000d    The theme, `Engaging with Involuntary Service Users', was co-produced\u000d      with local authority partners. Its policy relevance is apparent in major\u000d      policy documents, such as `Changing Lives, the 21st Century Review of\u000d      Social Work' (Scottish Executive, 2006) and the `Munro Review of Child\u000d      Protection' (2011). Munro recommends a shift away from managerially-based\u000d      practices towards more direct work with families, which our own findings\u000d      support. This practice and policy relevance has proved important in\u000d      creating a climate conducive to the project's activity and its reception\u000d      within wider practice, policy and academic communities. The aims of the\u000d      project were: to explore the complexities of involving involuntary clients\u000d      as partners in the social work process, and to identify pointers as to how\u000d      this might best be done. A subsidiary aim on the part of funders was to\u000d      learn about the processes of effective knowledge exchange in such\u000d      collaborative ventures.\u000d    In the research element of the project, knowledge exchange activities\u000d      were used to generate data that was grounded in practitioners' knowledge\u000d      of what was effective in working with involuntary clients. This involved:\u000d    \u000d      Three knowledge sharing seminars, bringing together academics and\u000d        social work staff from six local authorities. These events attracted\u000d        over 70 practitioners, who had opportunities to feed into the findings\u000d      Practitioner research projects on topics relating to the project\u000d        theme, with mentoring and training from UoE academics. Six projects were\u000d        completed in 2010.\u000d    \u000d    The research demonstrated that processes in social work practice with\u000d      involuntary clients were `messy', non-linear and often serendipitous. One\u000d      of the key project findings was that similar processes were apparent in\u000d      relation to knowledge exchange. In both cases, the development of\u000d      relationships was central. Key elements within this included the\u000d      establishment of trust, a sense of credibility and a sense of timeliness\u000d      and meaningfulness to participants. This focus on relationships and\u000d      emotions links to the debate around the centrality of relationship-based\u000d      practice in social work now re-emerging in the academic literature, which\u000d      identifies prevailing managerial cultures as impeding the establishment\u000d      and continuity of the type of relationships from which effective social\u000d      work practice might emerge.\u000d    What becomes important from this project is the finding that similar\u000d      forces are evident in respect of KE, where qualities of credibility,\u000d      reflexivity and emotion are central to its effectiveness; policy and\u000d      academic assumptions about knowledge exchange and mobilisation are likely\u000d      to be ineffective if they fail to understand the complexity of the\u000d      relationships that underpin them.\u000d    The research element of the project was supported by a scoping review of\u000d      existing research.

The cumulative\u000a      research evidence (including the findings of this study) suggest that\u000a      national suicide prevention\u000a      strategies need to apply an equity lens (focusing on a reduction in\u000a      socio-economic inequalities in\u000a      suicide risk) but many policy challenges need to be resolved, including\u000a      the strategic approach to\u000a      inequality reduction, whether people and\/or places are to be targeted, and\u000a      the identification of\u000a      interventions (policies, activities) that are likely to be effective in\u000a      reducing socio-economic\u000a      inequalities in suicide risk (Platt, 2011).\u000a    Evaluation of suicide prevention policy intervention\u000a    Choose Life, the National Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in\u000a      Scotland, was launched in\u000a      December 2002.

Since the present Scottish government made dementia\u000a      a priority, this has increased to 2-3 times per year. In 2007, the then\u000a      Scottish Minister for Public Health set up an advisory group, the Dementia\u000a      Forum, to inform and advise her of issues that needed to be addressed and\u000a      to guide the development of dementia as a national priority [5.1]. Two\u000a      members of the Scottish Dementia Working Group were invited to join this\u000a      influential group and continue to make a contribution to this forum (Dementia\u000a        in Scotland, Issue 60, December 2007, p. 1). During a visit by the\u000a      First Minister in 2009 they discussed the importance of challenging public\u000a      stigma and misconceptions of dementia (http:\/\/local.stv.tv\/edinburgh\/81230-salmond-to-visit-alzheimer-charity\/).\u000a    In 2009, SDWG partnered Scottish Parliament's Cross-Party Group on\u000a      Alzheimers at the launch of the Charter of Rights for people with dementia\u000a      and their carers in Scotland (http:\/\/www.palliativecarescotland.org.uk\/content\/publications\/charter-of-rights-launch-\u000a        8thOct20091.pdf).\u000a    This charter was to be central to the development of the first Scottish\u000a        Dementia Strategy, which was launched in 2010. During the\u000a      development of the Strategy, 10 members of the SDWG were involved in\u000a      workgroups and as partners running consultation events (see Foreword of\u000a      Strategy pages 6-7 by the chairman of SDWG, also page 28-29 acknowledging\u000a      the impossibility of producing such a document without SDWG input [5.2]).\u000a    \"The work that we have undertaken to produce this strategy would have\u000a        been impossible without the direct contribution of the Scottish Dementia\u000a        Working Group, whose members all have a diagnosis of dementia\" (page\u000a        28\/29) (Edward McLaughlin)\u000a    \"securing the government's recognition of dementia as a national\u000a        priority and the development of the Scottish Dementia Strategy &#8212; would\u000a        have been impossible without the active contribution of people with\u000a        dementia through the Scottish Dementia Working Group\" (Henry Simmons CEO\u000a        Alzheimer Scotland at the inaugural meeting of the EWGPWD)\u000a    Furthermore, there are three members of the SDWG who sit on the programme\u000a      board to oversee the implementation of the strategy\u000a      http:\/\/www.nes.scot.nhs.uk\/media\/584864\/membership_list.pdf)\u000a    \"Development of the Dementia Strategy included the close involvement of\u000a      Alzheimer Scotland and the Scottish Dementia Working Group, both of whom\u000a      endorsed our approach.

The findings from five research projects (see section 3)\u000a      challenged widely-held beliefs around the capacity of people with dementia\u000a      to participate in meaningful ways. These findings were further developed\u000a      and explored by a group of people with dementia, and led directly to the\u000a      formation of the SDWG as a means of challenging the status quo.\u000a    The original primary research, conducted in the course of a Royal Society\u000a      of Edinburgh\/Lloyds TSB Personal Research Fellowship (Wilkinson, UoE\u000a      1\/07\/2002 - 31\/12\/2003), was a longitudinal qualitative study interviewing\u000a      10 people with dementia and their family carer over a 12 month period.\u000a      This work was an early contribution to research that shifted the focus\u000a      onto the subjective experience of living with dementia and challenged the\u000a      lack of `voice' for people with dementia. The formation of the SDWG was\u000a      the central outcome of discussion of the research findings with a core\u000a      group of people with dementia. They decided that a formal grouping of\u000a      people with dementia was the best way to ensure effective self-advocacy,\u000a      campaigning, visibility and a foundation for evidencing the potential of\u000a      people with dementia to influence and engage. The SDWG was co-founded by\u000a      Wilkinson (UoE) and James McKillop, a person with dementia who chaired the\u000a      group for its first six years. He has published with Wilkinson and others\u000a      (Wilkinson et al 2004; section 3 below) has since become a member of the\u000a      Alzheimer Europe Working Group on the ethical issues of dementia research\u000a      and has been awarded an MBE for services to dementia. The core research\u000a      findings that formed the basis for the SDWG were:\u000a    \u000a      people with dementia do have an important and substantial contribution\u000a        to make to research (and policy and practice)\u000a      methodological and ethical challenges to their involvement can be\u000a        addressed\u000a      co-production and partnership working is effective.\u000a      \u000a\u0009  These findings challenged the widespread understanding that limited the\u000a        potential contribution of people with dementia to research, policy and\u000a        practice. At that time the majority of research exploring social\u000a        understandings of dementia, in itself an emerging field, was from a\u000a        carer's perspective. The RSE study was one of the first to support the\u000a        methodological inclusion of people with dementia, and the following four\u000a        pieces of funding all took this innovative methodological and\u000a        philosophical stance further (Wilkinson et al 2008; section 3 below).\u000a      Members of the SDWG have had a sustained involvement in research in\u000a        other contexts, including:\u000a         \u000a\u0009\u0009A research subgroup that works closely with the UoE dementia research\u000a        cluster setting research priorities and co-producing research bids and\u000a        being part of research projects.\u000a      The DEEP project which explored ways of empowering and engaging with\u000a        people with dementia\u000a        http:\/\/www.jrf.org.uk\/publications\/stronger-collective-voice\u000a        [5.4]\u000a      A member of the SDWG is on the advisory board of Scottish Dementia\u000a        Clinical Research Network\u000a        http:\/\/www.sdcrn.org.uk\/our-research\/our-research-strategy\u000a\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23984","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Strategies to engage with relevant beneficiaries by both CRFR and\u000d\u000a      ChildLine have led to significant and far-reaching impacts on policy,\u000d\u000a      practice and the development of support for children and families.\u000d\u000a    For both projects, strategies to ensure wide uptake started with initial\u000d\u000a      discussions with practitioners to draw out policy and practice\u000d\u000a      implications which were then communicated alongside the research findings.\u000d\u000a    For project 1, uptake was facilitated through engagement with 164\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and practitioners, including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      discussion with children from the Children's Parliament to include\u000d\u000a        reflections on policy and practice solutions with the research findings\u000d\u000a      letters sent to Directors of Social Work and Education drawing out the\u000d\u000a        implications\u000d\u000a      findings presented to internal Scottish government meetings.

CRFR academics were\u000d\u000a      interested in this novel and unique opportunity to investigate children's\u000d\u000a      unsolicited concerns and views.\u000d\u000a    The research was conducted in two distinct phases. Project 1\u000d\u000a      (Backett-Millburn &#8212; PI, Edinburgh 1996-2011; Jamieson &#8212; Co-I, 1978 -; and\u000d\u000a      Jackson &#8212; Research Fellow) was funded by the ESRC from 2004-05 (&#163;44k) and\u000d\u000a      investigated children who called ChildLine because they were concerned\u000d\u000a      about another member of their family (usually a parent). This project\u000d\u000a      investigated the records of 9,363 calls. Issues of mental health, domestic\u000d\u000a      abuse, drug and alcohol use emerged from this research. Parental alcohol\u000d\u000a      misuse was the most frequent concern that young people presented, and in a\u000d\u000a      high proportion of these calls children's main reason for contacting\u000d\u000a      ChildLine was physical abuse. This project was graded as `outstanding' by\u000d\u000a      the ESRC. This research was published in 2005, but became particularly\u000d\u000a      important after the election of the SNP Government in 2007, when there was\u000d\u000a      a shift in approaches to alcohol policy.\u000d\u000a    Project 2 (Backett-Millburn &#8212; PI, Jamieson &#8212; Co-I, Newall &#8212; Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow, 2005) built on the methodological learning from project one, and\u000d\u000a      was funded by the Scottish Government to investigate children calling\u000d\u000a      ChildLine about sexual health issues (2005-06; &#163;35k). The unsolicited\u000d\u000a      nature of calls on this topic was considered particularly important given\u000d\u000a      the sensitive nature of sexual health issues and ongoing concerns about\u000d\u000a      Scotland's poor levels of sexual health and wellbeing. In this project\u000d\u000a      14,244 calls were investigated, where children and young people aged 5-18\u000d\u000a      years expressed a wide range of concerns about their sexual health and\u000d\u000a      wellbeing, from seeking explanation and clarification about `normal'\u000d\u000a      development and sexual terminology to support and advice on pregnancy,\u000d\u000a      relationships, sexual identity and sexual abuse. This research identified\u000d\u000a      that children were concerned about these kinds of issues from a very young\u000d\u000a      age, and that there was a need for basic facts-of-life type information in\u000d\u000a      order to alleviate worry and concern. For some children and young people a\u000d\u000a      lack of basic information left them vulnerable to harm and abuse as they\u000d\u000a      were unable to understand what was happening to them. The findings were\u000d\u000a      launched in March 2007 and have been widely used by sexual health\u000d\u000a      practitioners and a range of professionals who work with children and\u000d\u000a      young people in school and care, and with parents to reinforce their role\u000d\u000a      in educating their own children.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23985","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    With the introduction of bans on smoking in public places in Scotland\u000a      (2006) and England (2007), the REF period has seen intensive activity in\u000a      the field of smoking prevention and cessation, where the underpinning\u000a      research of the Group and its ongoing policy evaluation activities have\u000a      had an intensive impact on changing policies and practices.\u000a    Young people and smoking\u000a    The Department of Health (DH) commissioned Amos to lead a review on young\u000a      people and smoking in England to inform the development of the\u000a      Government's tobacco control strategy white paper. The DH Review was\u000a      quoted and referenced in the UK Government's 2010 white paper `A Smokefree\u000a      Future &#8212; a Comprehensive Tobacco Strategy for England' [5.1] and included\u000a      a key diagram from the report (p. 26). This diagram also appears in the\u000a      Scottish Government's 2013 `Tobacco Control Strategy for Scotland' [5.2,\u000a      p. 12]. The UK Government's 2011 white paper `Healthy Lives, Healthy\u000a      People: a Tobacco Control Plan for England' also referenced the Review\u000a      [5.3]. The model developed in the Review underpinned the UK Government's\u000a      adoption of a broad policy approach. The Review's findings also influenced\u000a      smoking prevention policy and practice at regional\/local levels. Amos\u000a      presented the findings at several regional\/local tobacco control seminars\u000a      and has received feedback that this directly impacted on local plans and\u000a      priorities. This can be confirmed by regional tobacco control leads [5.4].\u000a      The Review's findings form part of the teaching on the only national CPD\u000a      course on tobacco control\u000a      (http:\/\/www.ukctcs.org\/ukctcs\/teaching\/index.aspx\u000a      or http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/puaswep).\u000a    Several of Amos's research publications on young people were referenced\u000a      in the Scottish Smoking Prevention Working Group's report `Towards a\u000a      Future Without Tobacco' [5.5]. This report had a major influence on the\u000a      Scottish Government's Smoking Prevention Action Plan `Scotland's Future is\u000a      Smoke Free' (2008) [5.6]. In the Foreword, the Minister for Public Health\u000a      states that the Action Plan \"builds upon and responds to the excellent\u000a      report, `Towards a Future without Tobacco',... the Expert Group's\u000a      recommendations also provide a clear mandate for the action proposed\".\u000a      This is highlighted throughout the Action Plan. Amos was a member of the\u000a      expert Prevention Working Group and played an active role, including\u000a      making presentations to the Group on her research.\u000a    Young people and smoking cessation\u000a    In Scotland the evaluation of the young people's cessation pilots led to\u000a      the recommendation in the Scottish Government's 2008 Smoking Prevention\u000a      Action Plan that youth smoking cessation services should not be\u000a      established; rather, young people should be supported through standard NHS\u000a      cessation services. The Action Plan states that \"in the light of the\u000a      recent poor outcome of the pilot smoking cessation services for young\u000a      people we recommend active consideration is given to developing other\u000a      approaches\" [5.6, p. 37]. This is reiterated in the national guidelines\u000a      for smoking cessation [5.7], with the study cited as the evidence base.\u000a      The DH Review (see above) is also cited in these guidelines.\u000a    Legislation banning smoking in enclosed public spaces\u000a    TCRG members were involved in the national evaluations of the English and\u000a      Scottish smokefree legislation. In Scotland, in response to a\u000a      Parliamentary Question on 12\/11\/08, the Public Health Minister referred to\u000a      the evidence from the national evaluation programme, which included two\u000a      TCRG studies, which showed that Scotland was benefiting from the ban\u000a      [5.8]. The Minister also stated \"importantly, there is evidence of a\u000a      change in the cultural acceptability of smoking\", which related to the\u000a      TCRG qualitative studies' findings. The English evaluation programme was\u000a      mentioned in the 2010 white paper `Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our\u000a      Strategy for Public Health in England' [5.3]. `Healthy Lives, Healthy\u000a      People: a Tobacco Control Plan for England' [5.3, pp. 37- 8], drawing on\u000a      an independent academic review of the evidence from the evaluation\u000a      programme [5.9], concluded that \"the Government believes that the aims of\u000a      the legislation continue to be effectively achieved.\" This evidence review\u000a      cites the Final Report and a paper from our English study (Hargreaves et\u000a      al 2010) and the Final Report of our Scottish study (Martin et al 2008).\u000a    Smokefree homes\u000a    The REFRESH project piloted an innovative intervention which successfully\u000a      used personal home air quality feedback with motivational interviews to\u000a      help smoking mothers reduce their children's exposure to secondhand smoke.\u000a      REFRESH has influenced policy and practice. REFRESH is mentioned four\u000a      times in the Scottish Tobacco Control Strategy [5.2, p. 24], including in\u000a      Action Point 28. Recommendations from REFRESH influenced the inclusion in\u000a      the Strategy of a commitment to set a target to reduce children's exposure\u000a      to secondhand smoke. Scotland was the first country in the world to make\u000a      such a commitment. TCRG members with ASH Scotland used REFRESH findings to\u000a      develop a `How to' guide for practitioners working with parents. 2700 hard\u000a      copies have been distributed to 2700 practitioners and it is also\u000a      available on the study website (http:\/\/www.refreshproject.org.uk).\u000a      It is cited as a recommended resource by the NHS Health Scotland's\u000a      Maternal and Early Years website and led to a question on smoking in the\u000a      home being included in the new 24-30 month infant review delivered by\u000a      public health nurses [5.10]. The Scottish Government's Second Hand Smoke-\u000a      Social Marketing Steering Group has explicitly drawn on the findings of\u000a      REFRESH in the commissioning of a national public health campaign to be\u000a      launched in Spring 2014 (5.10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Smoking is the single most important preventable cause of mortality and\u000a      inequalities in health in the UK.

TCRG members undertook the first\u000a      national study of innovative cessation approaches for young people\u000a      (2002-06) (Gnich et al 2008). Qualitative and quantitative methods were\u000a      used to evaluate a national programme of eight innovative pilot smoking\u000a      cessation projects in Scotland. The evaluation concluded that, while some\u000a      approaches had developed constructive ways of engaging with young smokers,\u000a      none had been effective in increasing quit rates.\u000a    TCRG members subsequently undertook several studies, mostly using\u000a      qualitative methods, which have made important contributions to\u000a      understanding the determinants of youth smoking. Amos was commissioned by\u000a      the Department of Health in 2008 to lead a review on young people and\u000a      smoking in England, which was to inform the development of the\u000a      Government's tobacco control white paper. This review developed a model\u000a      which summarised key determinants of smoking uptake and made\u000a      evidence-based recommendations on the most effective policy and practice\u000a      interventions in smoking prevention (Amos et al 2009).\u000a    Smokefree public places and homes (2002-12)\u000a    Scotland introduced comprehensive smokefree legislation banning smoking\u000a      in public places in 2006; the following year a similar ban was introduced\u000a      in England. These initiatives were described by Ministers as the most\u000a      important public health legislation in a generation. TCRG members\u000a      undertook three studies as part of the separate national evaluation\u000a      programmes in Scotland and England. These evaluations were internationally\u000a      unique in using qualitative longitudinal designs to explore the\u000a      legislation's impact on disadvantaged groups and in affluent compared to\u000a      deprived communities. As part of the Scottish evaluation programme\u000a      (CLEAN), they also undertook a qualitative study of the legislation's\u000a      impact on smoking in the home. These studies showed that the smokefree\u000a      legislation had an important influence on smokers' attitudes and behaviour\u000a      within and outside the home.

This is\u000a      designed to consolidate Getting It Right for Every Child within\u000a      legislation and will become law in 2014.\u000a    As part of national implementation, Aldgate and Rose led on writing the Guide\u000a        to Getting It Right for Every Child (Scottish Government, 2008),\u000a      which set out the core components, values and the national practice model\u000a      itself. The model was explained further in eight practice briefings\u000a      developed by Aldgate and Rose. Its application to risk assessment within\u000a      child protection practice was then set out in a paper (Aldgate and Rose,\u000a      2008) which informed the National Child Protection Guidance. The early\u000a      implementation of the framework and practice in the Highlands was\u000a      evaluated by Stradling, MacNeil and Berry from Edinburgh University\u000a      (Scottish Government, 2009), who acknowledged the contribution of Aldgate\u000a      and Rose to its success.\u000a    Since then, interest has also been shown by other countries in this\u000a      radical whole system approach, as well as its underpinning practice model\u000a      and tools. In Padua, Italy, the Ministerio del Lavaro e delle Politche\u000a      Sociali has used the framework in a practice guide (Guida Operativa)\u000a      for child welfare workers.\u000a    Aldgate's research on kinship care led to kinship care being recognised\u000a      in its own right by the Scottish Government. The National Fostering\u000a        and Kinship Care Strategy, published in 2006, took up the study's\u000a      recommendation that government support be central to its development. The\u000a      ensuing implementation paper confirmed the commitment of the Scottish\u000a      Government to meet the needs of kinship carers, as recommended. The\u000a      study's recommendations for kinship carer allowances were implemented in\u000a      Section 110 of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007, which\u000a      created powers to make provision for such payments. This has been taken\u000a      forward in Part VIII, regulation 33, of the Looked After Children\u000a      (Scotland) Regulations 2009 (see Guidance on Looked After Children\u000a        (Scotland) Regulations 2009 and The Adoption and Children (Scotland)\u000a      Act 2007) (http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Publications\/2010\/06\/01094202\/0).\u000a    Regarding the work in Wales, the report based on Rose's study into the\u000a      role of serious case reviews in the Welsh context argued for a radical\u000a      overhaul of the system. It has had significant influence on the\u000a      development of a national policy and practice framework. In her statement\u000a      to the Welsh National Assembly on 20 October 2009, the Deputy Minister for\u000a      Social Services, Gwenda Thomas, welcomed the report and called for\u000a      specific proposals on how to implement its ideas. In January 2010, Rose\u000a      was commissioned to develop detailed proposals and guidance building on\u000a      the study's findings. A whole systems approach to learning in child\u000a      protection was applied to the model design, underpinned by an agreed set\u000a      of principles, drawing from evidence of systems of review in different\u000a      disciplines, adult learning theory, and building on existing good practice\u000a      and resources available in Wales. The emphasis was on creating a culture\u000a      of multi-agency learning. The development process, led by Rose, was highly\u000a      collaborative, with the active engagement of policy officials and\u000a      professionals from different disciplines across Wales. Following a process\u000a      of feedback and model refinement, new statutory regulations were laid and\u000a      statutory guidance issued in December 2012 for national implementation\u000a      from 1 January 2013 (CSSIW, 2012).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    1.

This featured a new,\u000a        multi-disciplinary and ecological approach to child development (Aldgate\u000a        2005). This was incorporated into the theory and practice base of the Getting\u000a          it Right for Every Child model, alongside a strong commitment to\u000a        the rights based approach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the\u000a        Child, as explored by Aldgate (Scottish Government, 2013).\u000a       Aldgate also undertook empirical studies as part of a review of the\u000a        government's services for looked-after children. The first was a\u000a        qualitative study of twenty four children, exploring their perspectives\u000a        on their well-being. It was the first such study in Scotland (Aldgate\u000a        and McIntosh, 2006a).\u000a       The second was a mixed methods study of children who have been\u000a        formally looked after in kinship care. This was the first government\u000a        study on kinship care in Scotland and provided the first national survey\u000a        on policy and practice amongst the country's local authorities. The\u000a        study looked both at children's experiences within kinship care and the\u000a        issues that affected kinship carers (Aldgate and McIntosh, 2006b).\u000a       Both of these studies extended empirical approaches to involving\u000a        children in research. They also provided evidence on children's\u000a        perspectives about their well-being, in order to strengthen the case for\u000a        a child-centred approach, which became a core principle and component of\u000a        the national practice model of Getting It Right for Every Child.\u000a\u000a    \u000a    In Wales, two key pieces of research underpinned Rose's work. The first\u000a      was an empirical study by Rose and Barnes (2008), involving mixed methods,\u000a      of the existing system in England and Wales for reviewing child deaths.\u000a      The findings suggested there were issues to be addressed about the\u000a      consistency, effectiveness and impact of the reviews, and so posed\u000a      questions about the system's fitness for purpose. A second study (Rose,\u000a      2009), explicitly focused on Wales, was commissioned by the Welsh Assembly\u000a      and the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW). This examined\u000a      documentary evidence of reviews in Wales, comparing them with developments\u000a      elsewhere in the UK, and involved in-depth interviews with key\u000a      stakeholders. The findings suggested a high level of consensus about the\u000a      difficulties being experienced in process and practice and the need for\u000a      reform. Recommendations were made in the report for a way forward in\u000a      Wales, which were put to the Deputy Minister for Social Services (Gwenda\u000a      Thomas) for consideration and were subsequently approved.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24803","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The inclusive research approach in learning disability, pioneered and\u000a      developed at the OU, is part of the wider advocacy and resistance movement\u000a      in learning disability. By working with people with learning disabilities\u000a      as `expert witnesses' and co-producers of knowledge, we have enabled the\u000a      development of new skills that are transferable beyond the research\u000a      context for building independence and self-esteem. In this way, our\u000a      research has not only empowered people with learning disabilities to own\u000a      and control their stories, but it has enabled them to make changes in\u000a      their lives. For example, Central England People First, a self-advocacy\u000a      group, describe how a member was given the confidence to engage with the\u000a      NHS National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's Public Involvement\u000a      Programme. In addition they commented:` Being part of SHLD helped us meet\u000a      and develop partnerships with other groups, and understand how to write\u000a      funding bids, like the bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund (Your Heritage\u000a      Programme, &#163;50,000, Central England People First Ltd) which we won with\u000a      help from SHLD to write our own history.'\u000a    Other people with learning disabilities, who are also members of the SHLD\u000a      group, have been inspired to undertake projects to uncover previously\u000a      unknown histories, such as that conducted by People First Carlisle\u000a      Research Group (part of Cumbria People First), who were awarded a Heritage\u000a      Lottery Fund grant (&#163;50,000) to undertake a `Keeping Wartime Memories\u000a      Alive' heritage project, with the aim of gathering testimonies about the\u000a      experiences of learning disabled people during the Second World War.\u000a    People with learning disabilities participating in OU projects have gone\u000a      on to develop national and international profiles as advocates and\u000a      campaigners. For example, Mabel Cooper, one of the participants in\u000a      Atkinson's `Life histories' project, became a regular conference\u000a      contributor and achieved an Honorary Degree from The Open University in\u000a      2010 for her contribution to giving people with learning disabilities a\u000a      voice. Mabel sadly died earlier this year, but her advocate Jane Abraham\u000a      has written to us stating that:\u000a    `Because of her involvement in the OU research, Mabel Cooper grew in\u000a      self-confidence and in the ability to pass the skills she had gained onto\u000a      others. Over this period she regularly talked to trainee Social Workers\u000a      about her life story ... Mabel also led the training for a group of\u000a      self-advocates to help them tell their life stories and went with them\u000a      into two primary schools to talk to children. Her story, and the way she\u000a      told it, inspired others to tell their stories and to write a play. Mabel\u000a      also joined the Board of Trustees for Walsingham, a housing and support\u000a      provider working across the UK'.\u000a    The SHLD's research has had other notable impacts on practice. For\u000a      example, Ledger's research empowered people with learning disabilities to\u000a      shape how their care is delivered. Tenants of learning disability housing\u000a      provider Yarrow took pictures of their local area and places key to their\u000a      personal history. Using multi-media, photographs were superimposed onto\u000a      local maps to create life journey maps. These helped the tenants to share\u000a      with staff life story information that was previously missing. Having\u000a      demonstrated the importance of life story maps to person-centred care, the\u000a      findings of the work were incorporated into Yarrow's Business Plan and\u000a      practice. Lindy Shufflebotham, Deputy Chief Executive at Yarrow, wrote to\u000a      us saying: `Sue's research supported Yarrow's ongoing commitment to the\u000a      provision of very flexible responses and respite\/short break support,\u000a      developing models with the capacity to respond very quickly in\u000a      crisis-periods, when Sue's research highlighted people are especially\u000a      vulnerable to a move out of area. Influenced by the research, the\u000a      importance of life story work and documenting key relationships is covered\u000a      as part of our staff induction programme.'\u000a    The SHLD's research has also influenced policy. In November 2012,\u000a      following the serious case review into the abuse of patients with learning\u000a      disabilities at the Winterbourne View hospital, we submitted three\u000a      examples of good practice to the Department of Health's consultation `What\u000a        does good look like? These were:\u000a    \u000a      The SHLD's annual Inclusive Conferences, where people with learning\u000a        disabilities come together with academics, practitioners and\u000a        policy-makers to network, disseminate research findings and share\u000a        personal experiences;\u000a      Life journey maps, based on Ledger's research;\u000a      Mabel Cooper's schools project, in which she visited primary schools\u000a        to tell her life story in order to inform attitudes about learning\u000a        disability among young people.\u000a    \u000a    These have since been selected for inclusion in the Department of\u000a      Health's `Good Practice Project', providing a powerful endorsement of the\u000a      OU's work and its ability to influence policy and practice.

Its\u000a      work began in the context of mass de-institutionalisation, recording\u000a      people's experiences as they were moved into the community, revealing a\u000a      previously undocumented oral history of institutional and community care.\u000a      The work was pioneering in its use of inclusive methodologies to capture\u000a      data and narratives from people with complex needs, many of whom had been\u000a      on the margins of society for most, if not all, of their lives (Atkinson\u000a      and Walmsley, 2010). This participatory approach developed the capacity of\u000a      learning disabled service users to co-produce research into the history,\u000a      policy and practice of learning disability (Walmsley and Johnson 2003).\u000a    There are a number of key projects, related to this work, which underpin\u000a      the impact outlined in Section 4. Atkinson (OU Lecturer\/SL\/Professor from\u000a      1984-2010, now Emeritus Professor) conducted two projects in the 1990s\u000a      (`Past times' and `Life histories'), working with people with learning\u000a      disabilities in reconstructing their lives through memories and documents.\u000a      As well as producing new findings (including how and why individuals were\u000a      institutionalised) these projects enabled participants to reclaim their\u000a      individual and shared pasts. Alongside this work, Walmsley (OU Lecturer\/SL\u000a      1993-2004) was undertaking oral history research on gender, caring and\u000a      learning disability, and the history of community care, also using\u000a      inclusive approaches. Through the process of co-producing stories,\u000a      Atkinson and Walmsley, along with learning disabled researchers (see Mabel\u000a      Cooper, Section 4), developed methods to reveal and record memories of\u000a      institutional and community life (Atkinson et al, 1997).\u000a    These developments laid the foundations for subsequent OU projects that\u000a      adopted participatory approaches: for example, the oral histories of local\u000a      Mencap groups, by Walmsley and Rolph (2000-04); the history of day centres\u000a      in Croydon, by Atkinson (2006-07); and research into supported living and\u000a      quality of life for people with learning disabilities, by Atkinson and\u000a      Tilley (2009-11). They also fed into the SHLD's annual inclusive\u000a      conferences (Marshall and Tilley, 2013). More recently Sue Ledger,\u000a      supervised by Atkinson, Walmsley and Tilley, completed her PhD research\u000a      `Staying local: support for people with learning difficulties from Inner\u000a      London 1971-2007'. This adopted an inclusive life story approach to\u000a      explore why some people manage to remain local when so many of their peers\u000a      are sent to out-of-area placements (Ledger and Shufflebotham, 2006). The\u000a      research revealed the importance of responsive short breaks, staff who\u000a      worked across service boundaries and who advocated for local support, and\u000a      of long-standing relationships between individuals, families and service\u000a      users. It also revealed that key areas of personal histories, such as\u000a      family and friendship networks and details of where people had lived\u000a      previously, were not recorded in people's case notes and were thus\u000a      excluded from Person Centred Planning. The work was also innovative in its\u000a      use of mobile interviews, digital photography and the development of life\u000a      journey maps. Its impact upon Yarrow Housing is detailed in Section 4.\u000a    The impact and scale of the SHLD's contribution to the history of\u000a      learning disability, and to inclusive research, has been recognised in a\u000a      grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council for the co-production\u000a      of an accessible, distributed and living archive of learning disability.\u000a      Developing a co-produced, digital, and living archive of learning\u000a      disability history: An exploration of ethics, ownership and new\u000a      connectivities.

Raising public awareness through the media,\u000d\u000a      Anne was interviewed about her research by the United Nations\u000d\u000a        Womenwatch Newsletter in 2008 (Source 1) and was interviewed on\u000d\u000a      women's imprisonment by Charlotte Gill in Fabulous magazine (Part\u000d\u000a      of the Sun on Sunday), in May 2012 (also available online &#8212; Source\u000d\u000a      2). In 2008, Mary was interviewed about her research on women political\u000d\u000a      prisoners in Northern Ireland on BBC Radio 4's Thinking Allowed.\u000d\u000a      Mary was also an invited participant in the consultation on Volunteering\u000d\u000a        across the Criminal Justice System, convened by Baroness Julia\u000d\u000a      Neuberger, where Mary convened and minuted a discussion group for the\u000d\u000a      consultation's report published in 2009 by the Office for the Third\u000d\u000a      Sector. Anette has been contacted (separately) by the families of three\u000d\u000a      executed women thanking her for giving them a voice through her research.\u000d\u000a      She has remained in contact with one descendant who has written her own\u000d\u000a      non-academic autobiography and has told us that `through meeting Anette\u000d\u000a      and reading her research, I was able to understand so much more about the\u000d\u000a      injustice of what happened to my great-grandmother...I was [also] able to\u000d\u000a      gain insights and a deeper understanding of how the discrimination and\u000d\u000a      poverty of those post-industrial times impacted so disastrously on her and\u000d\u000a      her family'. (Sources 3 and 4).\u000d\u000a    Engaging with practitioners, Anne can point to the popularity of her 2009\u000d\u000a      article (co-authored with Gelsthorpe) in Probation Journal, a peer\u000d\u000a      reviewed journal but with a largely practitioner readership. The article\u000d\u000a      was in the top 20 `most read' online articles from the journal for three\u000d\u000a      years and reached number 10 in November 2012 (Source 5). Since 1998, Anne\u000d\u000a      has been invited regularly to teach a postgraduate module on `Women, Crime\u000d\u000a      and Criminal Justice' at the Crime Research Centre at the University of\u000d\u000a      Western Australia (UWA). Students on this Masters and CPD programme are\u000d\u000a      predominantly regional, national and international legal and criminal\u000d\u000a      justice practitioners and policy makers. UWA also appointed Anne as a\u000d\u000a      `Professor-at-Large' between 2006 and 2008 to promote inter-disciplinary\u000d\u000a      and community collaboration, resulting in closer relationships between UWA\u000d\u000a      and local criminal justice agencies (Source 6). She conducted workshops\u000d\u000a      with Community Corrections personnel and organised a conference `stream'\u000d\u000a      specifically for non-academic female criminal justice practitioners at the\u000d\u000a      2009 `Engendering Leadership' conference run by the UWA Business School.\u000d\u000a      This work goes beyond teaching and dissemination and demonstrates an\u000d\u000a      influence on long-term changes of attitude and practice. In May 2013 Anne\u000d\u000a      was invited to join an inspection team by the Custodial Inspector of\u000d\u000a      Western Australia as part of a State Government enquiry into a riot at a\u000d\u000a      mixed-gender youth detention centre. The report, which she co-authored (in\u000d\u000a      draft June 2013) will be presented to the WA Parliament and is an\u000d\u000a      excellent example of the application of feminist perspectives to a\u000d\u000a      `real-life' problem (Source 7).\u000d\u000a    Supporting local policy and provision for women offenders through\u000d\u000a          evaluation of voluntary and statutory provision in collaboration with\u000d\u000a          research users\u000d\u000a    Following the Corston Report on vulnerable women offenders in 2007, Anne\u000d\u000a      was approached and funded by the Butler Trust to undertake an evaluation\u000d\u000a      of the work of Adelaide House Outreach Programme for women offenders in\u000d\u000a      Liverpool. In carrying out this work in collaboration with Adelaide House\u000d\u000a      staff, Anne also engaged a recently released female parolee as her\u000d\u000a      research assistant, thus assisting the latter's rehabilitation and\u000d\u000a      providing her with career development opportunities. The resulting\u000d\u000a      research report, entitled Giving them back their dignity, was\u000d\u000a      published and disseminated by the Butler Trust in 2008, raising awareness\u000d\u000a      of, and giving credibility to, the excellent practice developed in\u000d\u000a      Liverpool (Source 8).\u000d\u000a    In 2009, Anne and Mary were approached by a large local voluntary\u000d\u000a      organisation, Brighter Futures, to conduct an evaluation of a new one-stop\u000d\u000a      shop provision for women offenders in North Staffordshire. This was\u000d\u000a      conducted in close collaboration with the research users and the\u000d\u000a      preliminary report informed a parliamentary question raised by the MP for\u000d\u000a      Stoke Central, Tristram Hunt in Jan 2011 (Source 9). The final report was\u000d\u000a      published on the Brighter Futures website and contributed to the project\u000d\u000a      securing further funding. Subsequently, Mary was invited by the Trustees\u000d\u000a      of the Brighter Futures charity to develop their strategic plan for\u000d\u000a      extending services for women offenders in the West Midlands (Source 10).\u000d\u000a      The report also resulted in the Stoke-on-Trent Community Safety lead\u000d\u000a      advising Staffordshire Police to employ Anne and Mary to evaluate their\u000d\u000a      Integrated Offender Management programme (2013-2014).\u000d\u000a    In 2012, Anne and Mary were approached by the voluntary organisation,\u000d\u000a      Spurgeons, and HM Prison Drake Hall for advice about setting up and\u000d\u000a      evaluating a mentoring programme for young women prisoners. Subsequently,\u000d\u000a      they were successful in obtaining a grant to undertake the evaluation,\u000d\u000a      which will be completed in 2014 (Source 11). Initial findings about the\u000d\u000a      relationship between mentors and mentees are likely to both inform and\u000d\u000a      challenge the development of mentoring programmes which are currently\u000d\u000a      being promoted by the Government. At this early stage, we suggest that\u000d\u000a      while individualised work with women offenders can be a vehicle for\u000d\u000a      `healing', empowering and supporting them to navigate their way through\u000d\u000a      and out of risky behaviours that are deemed to be associated with crime,\u000d\u000a      it can also license `soft' forms of social control through maternalistic\u000d\u000a      social relationships.\u000d\u000a    In sum, this historical, empirical and theoretical research has\u000d\u000a      challenged official discourses about the control and needs of women\u000d\u000a      offenders and the discrimination they experience within the criminal\u000d\u000a      justice system and the media. Specifically, in the period 2008-2013, Anne,\u000d\u000a      Mary, and Anette have supported local and national policy and practice for\u000d\u000a      women offenders through the evaluation of voluntary and statutory\u000d\u000a      provision in collaboration with research users. This research continues to\u000d\u000a      raise awareness and influence practice internationally, for example, by\u000d\u000a      regular teaching, workshops, conferences and expert advice involving\u000d\u000a      practitioners and policy makers in Australia. Finally, this research has\u000d\u000a      quietly made impact on those most closely affected by the treatment of\u000d\u000a      women offenders.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Critical historical, empirical and theoretical research on women\u000d\u000a      offenders is deeply embedded in the culture of criminology at Keele.\u000d\u000a      Research undertaken by Anne Worrall and colleagues at Keele since 1993\u000d\u000a      (and for a decade before) has contributed towards changing attitudes and\u000d\u000a      practice in the treatment of women offenders locally, nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally.

Keele criminologists have been at the forefront of these\u000d\u000a      developments and much of their work has arguably now become part of the\u000d\u000a      intellectual landscape to the point where it has been normalised (and\u000d\u000a      continues to shape the debate). This case study focuses specifically on\u000d\u000a      the work of Keele criminologists in respect of women as offenders,\u000d\u000a      where research has been concerned as much with asking the right questions\u000d\u000a      and challenging official assumptions as with conventional `findings'.\u000d\u000a    The specific research underpinning this case study (by Professor Anne\u000d\u000a      Worrall; Professor Pat Carlen (at Keele until 1996 then Visiting Professor\u000d\u000a      2001-2004); Anette Ballinger, Lecturer; Mary Corcoran, Lecturer; Julie\u000d\u000a      Trebilcock, Lecturer; and Claire Fox), consists of: Carlen and\u000d\u000a        Worrall's separate and joint research throughout the 1990s and their\u000d\u000a      collaborative European research on `Women, Integration and Prison' under\u000d\u000a      the EU Framework 5 initiative (2002-2005); Ballinger's historical\u000d\u000a      research on women and capital punishment (2000, 2004); Corcoran's\u000d\u000a      research on female political prisoners in Northern Ireland (2006); and\u000d\u000a      three evaluations of community provision for women offenders which were\u000d\u000a      undertaken between 2008 and 2013 by Worrall and Corcoran in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with third sector organisations. The involvement of Fox\u000d\u000a      in one of these evaluations and a further study on short-sentenced women\u000d\u000a      prisoners, undertaken by Trebilcock for the Howard League,\u000d\u000a      demonstrate the sustainability of our impact &#8212; both were ECRs who have\u000d\u000a      since moved to other universities.\u000d\u000a    Our work has contributed to the wide body of knowledge about women\u000d\u000a      offenders that has traced discriminatory attitudes through the 19th\u000d\u000a      and 20th centuries to the early 21st century. At its\u000d\u000a      most basic, this research has established that: women offenders experience\u000d\u000a      discrimination in the criminal justice system and the media; women's\u000d\u000a      pathways in and out of crime differ from those of men; women experience\u000d\u000a      and respond differently to criminal justice interventions from men,\u000d\u000a      especially imprisonment (and historically capital punishment); research on\u000d\u000a      women offenders and female offending struggles to be taken seriously by\u000d\u000a      mainstream criminology; and, despite numerous reports by academics and\u000d\u000a      NGOs, and supportive government statements, the same concerns about the\u000d\u000a      treatment of women offenders exist now as did 30 years ago (and are not\u000d\u000a      confined to any single jurisdiction), leading to a constant need to engage\u000d\u000a      in critical public debate, reiterating the principles that underpin good\u000d\u000a      practice in working with women offenders and pointing to a lack of\u000d\u000a      political will to provide the sustained funding needed to provide\u000d\u000a      effective and co-ordinated women-focused services.\u000d\u000a    While research on women's imprisonment is now widespread (and we\u000d\u000a      collaborate regularly with researchers at other institutions), the\u000d\u000a      significance of Keele's unique contribution has been its ability to\u000d\u000a      contextualise the treatment of women offenders within four other distinct\u000d\u000a      (and gendered) discourses: 20th century attitudes to capital\u000d\u000a      punishment; state responses to politically motivated offending;\u000d\u000a      supervision of offenders in the community; and the role of the voluntary\u000d\u000a      sector in criminal justice. Specifically: Ballinger and Corcoran have\u000d\u000a      exposed state violence towards transgressive women who commit serious\u000d\u000a      crime; Worrall and Corcoran have argued that non-custodial provision for\u000d\u000a      women offenders is essential in keeping women out of prison but also has\u000d\u000a      punitively discriminatory potential; and Ballinger has given a voice to\u000d\u000a      executed women and their descendants. By making the theoretical insights\u000d\u000a      of feminist perspectives accessible locally, nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally we have equipped, encouraged and supported policy-makers,\u000d\u000a      practitioners and women offenders (and their families) to challenge\u000d\u000a      `malestream' orthodoxies in their lives and workplaces.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27454","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact (1):\u000d\u000a      Brookman's research on the aetiology of homicide and her development of\u000d\u000a      homicide typologies\u000d\u000a      has led to an increased awareness and understanding of how the nature and\u000d\u000a      circumstances of\u000d\u000a      homicide impact upon opportunities for investigation. The indicators of\u000d\u000a      this impact can be found in\u000d\u000a      the Murder Investigation Manual [1]. On the first page of the 299 page\u000d\u000a      publication, the manual\u000d\u000a      cites Brookman's book on homicide and reproduces her typology of types of\u000d\u000a      homicide and a\u000d\u000a      classification of the relationship between the location of homicides and\u000d\u000a      the method of attack. The\u000d\u000a      first four pages of the manual in effect summarise the contents of her\u000d\u000a      book. The section summary\u000d\u000a      based on Brookman's research concludes: `Understanding the different\u000d\u000a      circumstances in which\u000d\u000a      homicide is committed ... will assist SIO's (Senior Investigating\u000d\u000a      Officers) to plan an effective\u000d\u000a      investigative strategy' [1] (p.25). The Murder Investigation Manual (MIM)\u000d\u000a      is seen as the definitive\u000d\u000a      guide on homicide investigation, by practitioners and policy makers alike.\u000d\u000a      It is used to underpin\u000d\u000a      the training and development of SIOs and has become a reference point for\u000d\u000a      the investigation of\u000d\u000a      all types of major crime. Brookman's research was the only academic\u000d\u000a      publication referred to in\u000d\u000a      the manual.\u000d\u000a    Impact (2):\u000d\u000a      The recommendations to broaden the outcome measures of homicide\u000d\u000a      investigation were made to\u000d\u000a      the Programme Manager of the International Association of Chief of Police\u000d\u000a      (IACP) in person\u000d\u000a      during spring 2012, in Washington, D.C., when she visited the IACP Head\u000d\u000a      Offices and later in a\u000d\u000a      presentation at the Homicide Open Forum held at the Annual IACP Conference\u000d\u000a      in San Diego in\u000d\u000a      September 2012. [2] Professor Brookman was invited to speak at the\u000d\u000a      conference by the\u000d\u000a      Programme Manager of the IACP [3]. Brookman proposal for using new ways of\u000d\u000a      evaluating police\u000d\u000a      performance in homicide investigation were later included in the\u000d\u000a      directives of the International\u000d\u000a      Association of Chiefs of Police titled, 10 Things Chiefs can do to\u000d\u000a        Positively Impact Homicide\u000d\u000a        Investigation Outcomes. [4] The 10th directive was called\u000d\u000a      `Measure beyond closure' and included\u000d\u000a      a reference to Brookman's article with Innes as well as listing the four\u000d\u000a      distinct measures of\u000d\u000a      investigative success. The directives proposed that investigators should\u000d\u000a      start tracking and\u000d\u000a      measuring this broader range of investigative impacts instead of focusing\u000d\u000a      exclusively upon case\u000d\u000a      closure. These recommendations derived directly from her research and from\u000d\u000a      the knowledge\u000d\u000a      obtained about homicide investigation while conducting research in the US\u000d\u000a      and the UK.\u000d\u000a    Impact (3):\u000d\u000a      During her recent fieldwork in Prince George's County, Maryland, in the\u000d\u000a      US, Professor Brookman\u000d\u000a      produced a Homicide Investigation Research Briefing which included a\u000d\u000a      recommendation to\u000d\u000a      introduce Family Liaison Officers (FLO's) in the department in order to\u000d\u000a      enhance the treatment of\u000d\u000a      the families of homicide victims. [5] The insights for these schemes came\u000d\u000a      directly from her\u000d\u000a      knowledge of their successful operation in the UK. The Deputy Chief of\u000d\u000a      Police wrote to Dr\u000d\u000a      Brookman to thank her for what he described as, `...really good\u000d\u000a      suggestions on how the Homicide\u000d\u000a      Unit should be sharing information with family members of homicide victims\u000d\u000a      in order to keep them\u000d\u000a      updated on the development of the investigation', and indicated in the\u000d\u000a      email that he will be looking\u000d\u000a      closely at adopting the strategy. [6] At the current time, the Research\u000d\u000a      Briefing has been submitted\u000d\u000a      to the Chief of Police for consideration. [6]\u000d\u000a    Current developments\u000d\u000a      In the last few years, Brookman has established the Criminal Investigation\u000d\u000a      Research Network\u000d\u000a      (CIRN) to enhance international communication and cooperation among, in\u000d\u000a      particular, homicide\u000d\u000a      investigators. [7] CIRN is an international major crime investigation\u000d\u000a      network that aims to advance\u000d\u000a      knowledge on the theory and practice of criminal investigation with a\u000d\u000a      particular focus upon\u000d\u000a      homicide and major crime. The network currently spans the UK, North\u000d\u000a      America, Australia and the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands and includes academics, current and former detectives,\u000d\u000a      detective trainers and\u000d\u000a      forensic scientists. The CIRN website lists around 40 current members\u000d\u000a      mainly from among high-ranking\u000d\u000a      serious crime investigators and academic researchers. The members were\u000d\u000a      recruited\u000d\u000a      initially from the symposium mentioned earlier organised by Brookman in\u000d\u000a      Cardiff in 2010 [8] as\u000d\u000a      well as attendees of her roundtable discussion group on homicide held at\u000d\u000a      the American Society of\u000d\u000a      Criminology (ASC) Conference in Chicago in November 2012. [9] A meeting\u000d\u000a      for all members is\u000d\u000a      scheduled for the next ASC conference due to take place in Atlanta in\u000d\u000a      November 2013.

She is the only\u000d\u000a      criminologist in the UK to\u000d\u000a      use this knowledge to inform directly methods of homicide investigation in\u000d\u000a      both the UK and the\u000d\u000a      United States (US).\u000d\u000a    Brookman's first area of research interest started with her PhD entitled\u000d\u000a      `Dying for Control: Men,\u000d\u000a        Murder and Sub-lethal Violence in the UK' completed in 2000\u000d\u000a      (Brookman, 2000). This was the\u000d\u000a      first academic examination of homicide in the UK for several decades and\u000d\u000a      involved the analysis of\u000d\u000a      3,474 homicide cases from the Home Office Homicide Index, 95 police murder\u000d\u000a      files and 20\u000d\u000a      interviews with male killers. The PhD dissertation was later published as\u000d\u000a      a book by Sage in 2005\u000d\u000a      under the title `Understanding Homicide' (Brookman, 2005). The book\u000d\u000a      also included several new\u000d\u000a      chapters on the topics of corporate homicide, investigation of homicide,\u000d\u000a      and preventing homicide\u000d\u000a      in the UK.\u000d\u000a    The second area of interest began in 2010 when Brookman conceived and\u000d\u000a      hosted an\u000d\u000a      international homicide and major crime investigation symposium in Cardiff.\u000d\u000a      One of the aims of the\u000d\u000a      symposium was to establish a research network and instigate a programme of\u000d\u000a      research and\u000d\u000a      publishing among homicide investigators and academics working in this\u000d\u000a      area. This resulted in a\u000d\u000a      special issue of the journal Policing and Society titled\u000d\u000a        Homicide and Major Crime Investigation\u000d\u000a      edited by Brookman and Innes. In that volume, the editors included their\u000d\u000a      own paper titled, `The\u000d\u000a      problem of success: What is a good homicide investigation?' (Brookman and\u000d\u000a      Innes, 2013).\u000d\u000a    The new insights or findings:\u000d\u000a    (1) The typologies of homicide were developed from the research conducted\u000d\u000a      for Brookman's PhD\u000d\u000a      dissertation (Brookman, 2000). The first typology identified major types\u000d\u000a      of homicide and\u000d\u000a      comprised 9 major categories and 14 subcategories ranging from domestic\u000d\u000a      homicide to gang\u000d\u000a      homicide. The second comprised a classification table that correlated\u000d\u000a      location of homicides with\u000d\u000a      method of attack.\u000d\u000a    (2) The recommendations on ways in which the police could enhance their\u000d\u000a      assessment of the\u000d\u000a      quality of homicide investigation by broadening their measures of success,\u000d\u000a      included the following\u000d\u000a      classification: (i) outcome success, (ii) procedural success, (iii)\u000d\u000a      community impact reduction\u000d\u000a      success, and (iv) preventative success (Brookman and Innes, 2000).\u000d\u000a    (3) The proposal that police departments in the US could make use of\u000d\u000a      Family Liaison Officers\u000d\u000a      (FLOs) derived from Brookman's earlier research in the UK and her\u000d\u000a      fieldwork knowledge of\u000d\u000a      homicide investigation in the US. Family Liaison Officers (FLO's) are a\u000d\u000a      routine feature of\u000d\u000a      homicide investigation in the UK and provide several benefits in assisting\u000d\u000a      families of the victims or\u000d\u000a      offenders, as well as providing investigative advantages for the police\u000d\u000a      and enhancing police-community\u000d\u000a      relations.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27455","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a        Impact (1) Change in Afghan Law\u000d\u000a        Because of vested interests and complex Afghan politics, the `hybrid\u000d\u000a          model' and its key recommendations were opposed by the Afghan\u000d\u000a          government for over a year after its publication. In 2009, the Afghan\u000d\u000a          Ministry of Justice &#8212; with the help of United States Institute on\u000d\u000a          Peace (USIP) &#8212; drafted a `National Policy on Relations Between the\u000d\u000a            Formal Justice System and Dispute Resolution Councils'. The key\u000d\u000a          recommendations of the `hybrid model' of justice developed by Dr\u000d\u000a          Wardak were written into the draft `National Policy'. The draft\u000d\u000a          policy, which was subjected to weekly discussions by a complex\u000d\u000a          `working group' for a very long time, was subsequently amended and\u000d\u000a          drafted as `The\u000a              Law on Dispute Resolution, Shuras and Jirgas', by the\u000d\u000a          Ministry of Justice. The draft law includes four chapters and 26\u000d\u000a          articles. The key objectives of this law are:\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a           To avoid dispute resolution between natural persons by Dispute\u000d\u000a            Resolution Shuras and Jirgas that is illegal or violates Shariah.\u000d\u000a           To provide access to easy, fair and cost effective justice for\u000d\u000a            people before their cases are officially handled by formal justice\u000d\u000a            institutions.\u000d\u000a           To improve and develop proper and acceptable local traditions and\u000d\u000a            customs.\u000d\u000a           To ensure legal and Sharia based rights of citizens especially of\u000d\u000a            women and children as they are vulnerable group in the society.\u000d\u000a           To minimalise accumulation of cases in the justice and legal\u000d\u000a            institutions especially in the courts.\u000d\u000a           To maintain relationship between Dispute Resolution Shuras and\u000d\u000a            Jirgas and Justice Institutions.\u000d\u000a           To determine duties and authorities of Dispute Resolution Shuras\u000d\u000a            and Jirgas.\u000d\u000a\u0009\u0009\u0009\u000d\u000a          The `hybrid model' and the `The\u000a                Law on Dispute Resolution, Shuras and Jirgas', caused\u000d\u000a            some debate among national and international players tasked with\u000d\u000a            rebuilding the justice system in Afghanistan. As the debate\u000d\u000a            continued, it has become part of a wider political debate in the\u000d\u000a            country. Since 2008, the implementation of the law was delayed as a\u000d\u000a            result of opposition from the Afghan Supreme Court (which has vested\u000d\u000a            interests in the existing judicial\/justice system) and from some\u000d\u000a            politicised women\/human rights groups in Afghanistan who suggested\u000d\u000a            that the new model of justice proposals were anti-women and in\u000d\u000a            breach of human rights. Wardak contested these criticisms and\u000d\u000a            further debate ensued. As a result of continued pressure from\u000d\u000a            conservative circles within the Afghan legal establishment and from\u000d\u000a            some politicised women\/human rights groups, the draft law has not\u000d\u000a            yet been forwarded to the Afghan Parliament for discussion and final\u000d\u000a            adoption.\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        Impact (2) Implementation of the `hybrid model'\u000d\u000a        Despite these concerns, ideas derived from Wardak's new model were\u000d\u000a          piloted in different parts of Afghanistan by the United States\u000d\u000a          Institute of Peace, by USAID, TLO and CPAU. Preliminary results of\u000d\u000a          pilot studies, in selected districts in Afghanistan, indicate that the\u000d\u000a          hybrid model provides workable solutions to many of the problems that\u000d\u000a          Afghan state and non-state justice systems currently face. [5] In\u000d\u000a          fact, in the northern Kunduz province, Wardak proposal has been given\u000d\u000a          an architectural instantiation by the UN Assistance Mission in\u000d\u000a          Afghanistan (UNAMA) Rule of Law Program, with the local shura\u000d\u000a          office co-located in the same little buildings as the Department of\u000d\u000a          Women's Affairs and the Hoquq (rights) Department of the Ministry of\u000d\u000a          Justice. [6]\u000d\u000a        One of the main aims of the `hybrid model' and its recommendations\u000d\u000a          has been the reform of Afghanistan's justice system, so that it\u000d\u000a          provides accessible justice effectively, cost-effectively, and\u000d\u000a          transparently and in accordance to human rights principles to all\u000d\u000a          Afghan citizens. However, political obstacles towards the\u000d\u000a          implementations, some national and international organisations\u000d\u000a          including the United States Institute of Peace, by USAID, TLO and CPAU\u000d\u000a          implemented some of the recommendations of the hybrid model at local\u000d\u000a          level in selected provinces. The results indicate that this has direct\u000d\u000a          impact on the lives of local peoples. A key example is that baad\u000d\u000a          (the use of women as a means of dispute resolution) as Jirga\u000d\u000a          outcomes had become increasingly rare. [7] Also, there is indirect\u000d\u000a          evidence that as a recommendation of the `hybrid model', a recent\u000d\u000a          study indicate that an overwhelming majority of people in Kunduz\u000d\u000a          province is supportive of inclusive (of men and women) processes of\u000d\u000a          traditional dispute resolution. [8] Also as a result of the\u000d\u000a          implementations of the ideas derived from this model, there is now\u000d\u000a          closer and a more effective cooperation among state and non-state\u000d\u000a          justice institutions in some Afghan provinces.

In 2007, the\u000d\u000a          UNDP published the report under the title, `Bridging Modernity and\u000d\u000a            Tradition: Rule of Law and the Search for Justice [4]. Wardak\u000d\u000a          was the first author of the report. As part of the process of writing\u000d\u000a          the report, he designed and supervised a survey of justice processes\u000d\u000a          in 32 of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. Based on the findings of the\u000d\u000a          survey and his ethnographic data in Afghanistan, he proposed his own\u000d\u000a          `Hybrid Model of the Justice System in Afghanistan'. The UNDP report\u000d\u000a          was prefaced and praised by President Karzai personally, and was\u000d\u000a          launched in New York and in Kabul.\u000d\u000a        The new insights or findings\u000d\u000a        Dr Wardak's research produced what is described as the `hybrid model'\u000d\u000a          of justice for Afghanistan. The `hybrid model' combined and blended\u000d\u000a          traditional Afghan justice (Jirga and Shura) with more\u000d\u000a          modern Afghan State justice system and existing human rights\u000d\u000a          institutions in Afghanistan. the `hybrid model of Afghan justice'\u000d\u000a          proposes the creation of institutional links between state and\u000d\u000a          non-state justice systems and a female-dominated human rights unit as\u000d\u000a          a check and balance on rights abuses by both courts and jirgas,\u000d\u000a          while courts and jirgas were also each checks and balances on\u000d\u000a          the other. According to this model, the Alternative Dispute Resolution\u000d\u000a          (ADR) mechanisms would handle minor criminal offenses and civil cases,\u000d\u000a          giving people a choice to have their cases heard at the nearest state\u000d\u000a          court. All serious criminal cases, according to the model, would fall\u000d\u000a          exclusively within the jurisdiction of the state justice system. The\u000d\u000a          model further proposes that when ADR decisions fail to be approved by\u000d\u000a          either the proposed Human Rights Unit or the concerned state court,\u000d\u000a          they would need to be revised, or referred to state justice system for\u000d\u000a          adjudication. Also, when ADR decisions are not satisfactory to one or\u000d\u000a          both disputants, they can be taken back to the state justice system.\u000d\u000a        "},{"CaseStudyId":"28488","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Publication of what the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education\u000d\u000a      (NIACE) has described as \"the first major piece of research on young\u000d\u000a        adult carers\" (A) has led to a `new' group of carers being\u000d\u000a        formally recognised.

In 2010, the\u000d\u000a      new Coalition Government `refreshed' the England National Carers\u000d\u000a        Strategy. The new Strategy recognised and differentiated between\u000d\u000a      young carers and YACs and endorsed cross-departmental Government\u000d\u000a      commitment to work with others to \"provide young adults (including young\u000d\u000a      carers) with continuity of careers advice\" (D).\u000d\u000a    The Scottish Government also used the research to inform its 2010\u000d\u000a      Young Carers Strategy and cited the research extensively. It \"concluded\u000d\u000a        that the findings of a major study undertaken by Saul and Fiona Becker\u000d\u000a        into the needs of young adult carers were highly relevant to this\u000d\u000a        [Scottish] Strategy\" (E). The Scottish Strategy's recommendations\u000d\u000a      (Appendix 5 of (E)) for developing policy and services in Scotland draw\u000d\u000a      almost verbatim on the recommendations on joined-up working in the\u000d\u000a      original YAC research report and the specific recommendations therein\u000d\u000a      about meeting the needs of YACs.\u000d\u000a    Saul Becker is the sole academic member of the National Policy Forum\u000d\u000a      established in January 2013 by NIACE to take forward ideas and policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations. In May 2013, the Care and Support Bill for England\u000d\u000a      (Clause 41, 1b) stated that local authorities should consider young\u000d\u000a        carers' current needs and how these might change post-18, to aid\u000d\u000a      transition planning &#8212; a key recommendation of the YAC research (F).\u000d\u000a    The significance of the introduction of new services has been formally\u000d\u000a      recognised in the House of Lords by Earl Howe, Parliamentary Under\u000d\u000a      Secretary of State (Quality) Health, who stated \"more young carers\u000d\u000a        services are extending their age group to cover young adult carers\u000d\u000a      ... the transition between children's services and adult services should\u000d\u000a      be smoother\" (G).\u000d\u000a    The Chair of the Standing Commission for Carers noted in the\u000d\u000a      Foreword to the YAC report (1) that the research \"provides an evidence\u000d\u000a      base for the development and delivery of more personalised support and\u000d\u000a      better outcomes for a vital but often `silent minority' of young people\".\u000d\u000a    Inspiring service development\u000d\u000a      The original research report has been referred to as the evidence for\u000d\u000a      developing new services for YACs in many local authorities\u000d\u000a      (including Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Blackpool, Birmingham, Nottinghamshire\u000d\u000a      (H)) and by carers organisations in the UK. Numerous projects\u000d\u000a      funded by the Government's Innovation Fund and through Comic\u000d\u000a        Relief Programmes introduced services or expanded the eligible age\u000d\u000a      range for support from 18 (young carers) to 24 &#8212; to include YACs.\u000d\u000a    The YAC research provided the evidence base for Carers Trust's successful\u000d\u000a      bid to become the Co-Operative Society's Charity of the Year,\u000d\u000a      whose support is worth an estimated &#163;7m over three years (2013-16) to\u000d\u000a      develop new services specifically for YACs.\u000d\u000a    Saul Becker has been invited as a steering group member to advise the\u000d\u000a        National Union of Students in helping to develop national policy\u000d\u000a      responses and recommendations for YACs attending university, and the NUS\u000d\u000a      has added information and advice to its website for student carers. A\u000d\u000a      number of universities are also engaging for the first time with the\u000d\u000a        learning needs of YACs and are developing resources and support,\u000d\u000a      including Essex, Oxford, Winchester and Nottingham. For example, in June\u000d\u000a      2013 Nottingham University hosted the first national University open day\u000d\u000a      specifically for carers under the age of 24.\u000d\u000a    Providing psychometric tools to inform practice\/interventions\u000d\u000a      The psychometric instruments (MACA and PANOC) developed by Saul Becker\u000d\u000a        and his team have now been widely adopted. The instruments are used\u000d\u000a      across the UK in most young carers projects, by local authorities, other\u000d\u000a      researchers and professionals, and are increasingly being used\u000d\u000a      internationally. For example, the multi-million pound Comic Relief\u000d\u000a        Young Carers Grants Programmes from 2008 onwards required all funded\u000d\u000a      projects to use the instruments for self-monitoring and evaluation. The Government's\u000d\u000a        &#163;1m Innovation Fund, announced in 2010, also required all projects\u000d\u000a      to use the MACA and PANOC.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, the BBC used the MACA with 4000 secondary school pupils\u000d\u000a        across the UK to screen for `hidden' young carers, advised by Saul\u000d\u000a      Becker (I). The findings, reported widely by the BBC and other media,\u000d\u000a      showed a much higher proportion of young carers than indicated by\u000d\u000a        Census figures &#8212; 8% of all children &#8212; and received substantial\u000d\u000a        attention by policy makers (J). These MACA-derived figures are\u000d\u000a        now used widely, including by UK Government, as a more reliable\u000d\u000a      indicator of the extent of caring amongst young people, e.g. (K).\u000d\u000a    In 2012, the MACA and PANOC were used by York Consulting and Ecorys\u000d\u000a      as part of their evaluation of the Government's Innovation Fund and the\u000d\u000a      Comic Relief Young Carers Grants Programme 2008-11. The evaluation of the\u000d\u000a      PRTC's `Improving Health Outcomes Grant programme 2012-13' also requires\u000d\u000a        evaluators to use MACA and PANOC. All fifty projects to be funded\u000d\u000a      under the multi-million pound Co-op\/Carers Trust YAC Programme\u000d\u000a      (2013-16) must use MACA and PANOC (L).\u000d\u000a    Blackpool and a number of other local authorities used the MACA in\u000d\u000a        schools to screen for hidden young carers. Nottinghamshire County\u000d\u000a      Council uses the instruments to assess young carers as part of a new\u000d\u000a      multimillion pound recurring programme of support (H). Young carers'\u000d\u000a      projects across the UK use the tools for assessment and for determining\u000d\u000a      levels and types of support (L).\u000d\u000a    On an international level, requests for translation of the\u000d\u000a        instruments have been granted to Norway, India, Taiwan, China,\u000d\u000a      Japan. The tools are being used by practitioners and researchers in the\u000d\u000a      USA, Sub-Saharan Africa, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand\u000d\u000a      and Australia (M). In Norway (N) for example, Saul Becker is\u000d\u000a        advising government departments that are intending to use the MACA\u000d\u000a      to screen for hidden young carers, and from this evidence base they intend\u000d\u000a      to develop policy and services.\u000d\u000a    Raising awareness\u000d\u000a      The research also received prominent coverage on national television\u000d\u000a        and radio. In October 2012, BBC Radio 1 broadcast the first\u000d\u000a        radio show specifically on YACs, `Keeping Mum', the commissioning\u000d\u000a      and content of which was directly informed by the YAC research findings.\u000d\u000a      Five YACs hosted a two hour show which clearly resonated with other young\u000d\u000a      people and YACs, as illustrated by many emails and tweets received by the\u000d\u000a      BBC. Official BBC figures give combined listenership for the show as\u000d\u000a        415,000 and related news reports and shorter appearances reached a\u000d\u000a      further 11 million radio listeners and 3 million TV viewers. As a\u000d\u000a      result of the programme, the Care Minister confirmed to the BBC\u000d\u000a      that schools, colleges and GPs must \"up their game\" for YACs.\u000d\u000a    Dissemination to policy and practitioner individuals\u000d\u000a      Since 2008, Saul Becker has been invited as `expert' keynote speaker\u000d\u000a      to present research findings to MPs, Lords, Ministers, senior civil\u000d\u000a      servants, service providers and young adult carers in the Houses of\u000d\u000a        Parliament and to Government departments in countries which include\u000d\u000a      Norway, Sweden and Australia. Saul Becker used 30 keynote invitations\u000d\u000a        at policy and practitioner conferences across the UK and internationally\u000d\u000a      to disseminate the Manual and the applicability of the tools,\u000d\u000a      including providing `master classes' to practitioners in the UK,\u000d\u000a      Australia, Norway and Sweden on how to score and interpret the findings.\u000d\u000a    The former Department for Children, Schools and Families made the\u000d\u000a      research report (1) available as a free PDF download on its website and\u000d\u000a      the publication of the research report (1) and the user Manual for\u000d\u000a      MACA and PANOC (2) was also accompanied by a programme of active\u000d\u000a        dissemination. This included coordinated press releases from the\u000d\u000a      University of Nottingham and the PRTC, and emails to over 4000 policy\u000d\u000a        makers and practitioners across the world, generating international\u000d\u000a      interest. The Manual and research report are available free on the\u000d\u000a      Carers Trust website and on Saul Becker's. Paper copies of the Manual\u000d\u000a      were sent to projects involved in the research and to all 350 young\u000d\u000a        carers' projects in the UK.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Publication of the first major piece of research on young adult carers\u000d\u000a      [YACs] has led to recognition of a `new' group of carers in policy\u000d\u000a      and practice, and the development of two new psychometric instruments.\u000d\u000a    Raising awareness with Government, policy makers and service providers,\u000d\u000a      has resulted in the provision of new services and support and further\u000d\u000a        education provision for YACs across the UK, and the psychometric\u000d\u000a        tools are now being used extensively by organisations including\u000d\u000a      Comic Relief, The Government Innovation Fund, the BBC, and in a dozen\u000d\u000a      countries.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Nottingham\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Nottingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Nottingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10007154}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    The quality of underpinning research is evidenced by the fact that the\u000d\u000a      following outputs have been published in a peer-reviewed journal or are\u000d\u000a      the result of a peer-reviewed funding process.\u000d\u000a    Research outputs\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

In response,\u000d\u000a      Saul Becker secured &#163;45,000 from The Princess Royal Trust for Carers\u000d\u000a      (4) (now Carers Trust) to undertake the first national, mixed methods\u000d\u000a        study of young adult carers [YACs]. The research includes a\u000d\u000a      literature review, secondary analysis of Census data, two national\u000d\u000a      surveys, focus groups, and over 50 in-depth interviews with YACs (1).\u000d\u000a    Data presented in the research provide new insights into the number,\u000d\u000a        experiences, needs and support received by YACs. The research reveals\u000d\u000a        for the first time the number of YACs in the UK (229,318; 5.3% of all\u000d\u000a        young people). Other findings show, for example, that many YACs do\u000d\u000a      not access further or higher education because of past and\/or current\u000d\u000a      caring responsibilities and those who do get to University are\u000d\u000a      unrecognised, finding their academic performance can be impaired by\u000d\u000a      combining study with caring. The research also shows that transitions\u000d\u000a        to adulthood and independence, and finding and keeping paid work, are\u000d\u000a        difficult when young people have to provide care at home.\u000d\u000a    Before 2007 there had been no specific and validated instruments for\u000d\u000a      assessing the extent and nature of caring conducted by young people and\u000d\u000a      for measuring outcomes on young carers. In response to this gap, Saul\u000d\u000a      Becker and his team were awarded &#163;23,000 by Comic Relief (5) to develop\u000d\u000a        two psychometric instruments for use by policy audiences, practitioners,\u000d\u000a        researchers and others to assess the amount and types of caring roles\u000d\u000a        undertaken by young people, and the positive and negative outcomes of\u000d\u000a        caring: (i) Multidimensional Assessment of Caring Activities\u000d\u000a      Checklist, MACA-YC18; and (ii) Positive and Negative Outcomes of Caring\u000d\u000a      Questionnaire, PANOC-YC20 (2). Over 500 YACs and young carers were\u000d\u000a        involved in the development, testing and validation of the instruments\u000d\u000a      (3).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28489","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Morris' recommendations on family participation in case reviews have\u000a        been included in the latest version of the UK Government's Working\u000a          Together to Safeguard Children guidance\u000a      (A). This is the core child protection document for all professionals\u000a      (social care, health, police, etc.) in England whose work brings them into\u000a      contact with children. It includes a new section (pp. 66-67) on the\u000a      management of case reviews which directly reflect Morris's research-based\u000a      recommendations. Morris's research report was published by the British\u000a      Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect\u000a      (BASPCAN) and distributed to its 1000+ members and all local authority and\u000a      central government policy leads (1, above). In its forward the Chair of\u000a      BASPCAN noted that the research had \"challenged the status quo and the\u000a        final recommendations are a powerful force for change and improvement\".\u000a    Since the production of early findings and the publication of her report,\u000a      Morris has been invited to share her findings with senior policy makers\u000a      and expert practitioners at a House of Lords consultative seminar hosted\u000a      by the Earl of Listowel (6-12-12); a Department of Health seminar\u000a      (15-5-13) and a Capita Conference (23-9-13) (B); and at similar events in\u000a      Edinburgh, Scotland (29-11-12) and Belfast, Northern Ireland (19-12-12). Both\u000a        the Scottish and Irish Governments are now following England's lead and\u000a        incorporating Morris's recommendations into their national policy\u000a        guidelines on child protection and there is evidence of Morris's\u000a      report being used in these countries (C).\u000a    As well as influencing policy, the guidelines are permeating practice; a\u000a      Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) Manager's review of the guidance\u000a      states:\u000a    \"One of the greatest challenges for LSCBs is how we engage families\u000a        both effectively and sensitively in the Serious Case Review process.\u000a        This thought provoking research provides for the first time an insight\u000a        to what the process is like from the perspective of the family and from\u000a        this develops practice guidance that will be a become an invaluable\u000a        resource.\" (D)\u000a    Drawing on her research, Clawson wrote the multi-agency guidelines on\u000a        forced marriage of people with learning disabilities for the\u000a        Government's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) (E), which are claimed to be\u000a      \"extremely useful in tackling...cases\" by the Association of\u000a      Directors of Adult Social Services and the FMU (F). The guidelines are\u000a      being used to inform policy and practice and have been circulated by the\u000a      FMU to statutory and voluntary sector social care organisations, schools,\u000a      colleges and criminal justice professionals &#8212; including the police and\u000a      health services. They are available on Safeguarding Board websites, e.g.\u000a      (G).\u000a    The guidelines are influencing the courts. In a Court of Protection case,\u000a      Justice Parker drew on the guidelines and, in her summing up, recommended\u000a      that \"these guidelines should be widely disseminated\" (H). The\u000a      research continues to influence legislation as evidenced by the recent\u000a      invitation by Rt. Hon., Elizabeth Butler-Sloss for Clawson and the Ann\u000a      Craft Trust speak at the National Commission on Forced Marriage in the\u000a      House of Lords on 31 October 2013.\u000a    A training pack was developed and piloted by Clawson and the Ann Craft\u000a      Trust in 2011: fifty frontline safeguarding practitioners from across the\u000a      UK were trained and these resources are now used for training by Adult and\u000a      Child Safeguarding Boards (I). Clawson also identified the need for, and\u000a      now Chairs, a National Steering Group on Forced Marriage and Learning\u000a      Disability whose members include representatives from FMU and statutory\u000a      and voluntary agencies and visiting attendees such as The Canadian High\u000a      Commission. This Steering Group ensures the ongoing recognition of this\u000a      issue. As Chair, Clawson reports directly to the FMU National Partnership\u000a      Board, which is fundamental to the development of policy and legislation.\u000a    Clawson is frequently approached as an expert in this field to raise\u000a      awareness of key issues. Media appearances include: national newspapers\u000a      (The Times, 16-7-12; The Guardian 1-8-12); reports on local radio (BBC\u000a      Nottingham; BBC Derby; BBC Northampton; BBC Leicester), national radio\u000a      (BBC radio 4 `Face the Facts' 1-8-12; BBC Asian Network 3-8-12) and\u000a      international radio (BBC World Service 15-8-11); UK television (ITV\u000a      London, 7-6-13).\u000a    In 2012, the FMU awarded Clawson and the Ann Craft Trust &#163;5,500 for a\u000a      follow-on study to explore how the national guidelines have impacted upon\u000a      frontline practice. This work is ongoing.\u000a    Recommendations from Fyson's work on Learning Disability Partnership\u000a        Boards directly informed the 2009 Valuing People Now\u000a      White Paper (Cm 5086) (J). Her work was part of the Department of\u000a      Health learning disability policy review and is referenced in the White\u000a      Paper (pp.116-7). Moreover, in line with a key recommendation, the\u000a      Government issued guidance on Partnership Boards to the 152 local\u000a      authorities and health trusts in October 2009 (K). The content of the\u000a      guidance closely reflected four of the five recommendations made by Fyson.\u000a    Reaching out directly to local policy makers, Fyson's research findings\u000a      have been made publicly available via various websites including Mencap's\u000a      website (L) and the NHS library. Hard copies of the research report &#8212; in\u000a      both standard\/full and accessible\/`easy words and pictures' format &#8212; were\u000a      distributed to all 150 Learning Disability Partnership Boards in England.\u000a    The guidelines are influencing practice within local authorities -\u000a      numerous local authorities have reproduced either Fyson's original report\u000a      (2008) or the Government's (2009) White Paper and the guidelines on their\u000a      websites (e.g. M).

All three researchers have worked closely with Government\u000a      bodies and national charities in developing research relating to the\u000a      safety and well-being of vulnerable children and adults.\u000a    In 2010, Morris was commissioned by the British Association for\u000a      the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (BASCPAN) (7) to\u000a      undertake an innovative study of family participation in case reviews\u000a      (1,2). The study explored the experiences of families and professionals in\u000a      case reviews where a child had died or suffered serious injury as a result\u000a      of abuse or neglect. For the first time, the experiences of families\u000a        participating in case reviews were being researched. The study\u000a      identified an uneven picture of family involvement. This reflected\u000a      professional uncertainty about the purpose, value and role of family\u000a      involvement in this aspect of child protection processes. Three key\u000a      recommendations were made for improving practice:\u000a    \u000a      given the complexity and individuality of each situation, guiding\u000a        principles rather than prescriptive practice is best suited to the\u000a        policies and practices of family participation;\u000a      families and `significant others' should be invited to\u000a        participate in case reviews involving anyone who was important to that\u000a        particular family system;\u000a      the type and nature of family participation hinges on the scoping\u000a        stage of the review process. Therefore the guidance for setting the\u000a        terms of reference at the start of each review should include early\u000a        opportunities for the family to contribute. The nature and type of\u000a        family participation should be mapped out at the start of the review\u000a        process.\u000a    \u000a    In 2010, Clawson worked with the Ann Craft Trust, a national\u000a      charity based within the School which works to prevent the abuse of people\u000a      with learning disabilities, to undertake the first UK study on forced\u000a        marriage of people with learning disabilities (8). Discussions with\u000a      the Home Office\/Foreign and Commonwealth Office Forced Marriage Unit (FMU)\u000a      revealed that they had little information on the prevalence, motivations\u000a      or consequences of forced marriage for this group and how this linked to\u000a      current safeguarding practices. Key findings showed that the predominant\u000a      reason for forcing someone to marry is to obtain a carer (3,4). Many\u000a      families would not view this as `wrong' even where the person with the\u000a      learning disability did not have capacity to consent and as a result many\u000a      frontline professionals believed that they needed additional training and\u000a      support to manage these cases effectively.\u000a    In 2007, Fyson was commissioned by Mencap (9) to conduct research\u000a        into the role and effectiveness of Learning Disability Partnership\u000a        Boards (LDPBs) (5). Mencap had commissioned the research on behalf\u000a      of the Department of Health and the Government's Learning Disability\u000a      Taskforce as part of a review of the Valuing People White Paper.\u000a      There was a concern that many Partnership Boards were not succeeding in\u000a      fulfilling their strategic function of shaping local services for people\u000a      with learning disabilities. The research identified clear tensions between\u000a      the requirements for LDPBs to operate in fully inclusive ways and their\u000a      ability to affect strategic change within local services (6). Fyson made\u000a      five key recommendations to the Department of Health to improve the\u000a      effectiveness of LDPBs:\u000a    \u000a      clearer guidance from central Government about the roles and\u000a        responsibilities of LDPBs;\u000a      LDPBs to be given statutory recognition;\u000a      LDBPs to strengthen their democratic mandate by having elected\u000a        councillors as Board members;\u000a      firmer Government guidance to be issued requiring statutory agencies\u000a        to participate in LDPB processes; and\u000a      LDPBs to set clear targets against which their achievements could be\u000a        measured.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28490","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research in this case study has had an impact on the following four\u000a      areas of policy and practice:\u000a    Influencing UK legislation\u000a      In 2008, the Government considered proposals to introduce legislation\u000a      criminalising the sex buyer in England and Wales. The proposal was\u000a      presented as an anti-trafficking measure, as it was claimed that the\u000a        majority of sex workers in the UK were victims of trafficking.\u000a      However, groups opposed to these proposals (including Safety First\u000a      Coalition, English Collective of Prostitutes, x:talk project collective,\u000a      International Union of Sex Workers) drew upon O'Connell Davidson's\u000a        research to challenge such assertions and to lobby more effectively\u000a      against Clause 13 (subsequently Clause 14) of the Policing and Crime Bill,\u000a      2009 (A,B,C). The English Collective of Prostitutes have said \"Prof\u000a        O'Connell Davidson's research was crucial in the run up to the\u000a        introduction to the 2009 Policing and Crime Act... [lending] invaluable\u000a        weight and credibility to our work\" (A).\u000a    The research influenced and informed Parliamentary debate. The\u000a        Government ultimately enacted a revised version of the original\u000a        proposals, criminalising the purchase of sexual services from\u000a      prostitutes subjected to force, not the purchase of sexual services all\u000a      together (as set out in the 2009 Bill).\u000a    Influencing international agencies\/global organisations\u000a      The research has been adopted and widely referenced in reports by\u000a        international agencies pressing States to address the labour and\u000a      migration policies that co-construct demand by leaving some groups\u000a      vulnerable to exploitation. This includes the International Labour\u000a      Organisation (D), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in\u000a      Europe's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (E), the\u000a      Council of Europe and the International Organization for Migration. The\u000a      research funded by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (6) was the\u000a        first systematic study of demand, and its findings, as well as those\u000a      of the ESRC funded research (7), in the words of the Executive Director\u000a      Anti-Trafficking, Austrian Institute for International Affairs (OIIP),\u000a      have:\u000a    \"had and will have a strong impact on further approaches and responses\u000a        to the complex problem of human trafficking, in the sense of enabling\u000a        decision-makers, stakeholders, NGOs and International Organizations\u000a        (such as UNODC, OSCE, IOM, ICMPD...) and politicians to shift the terms\u000a        of international policy debate on the demand side away from mere guesses\u000a        and ideologically-rooted suppositions to addressing the conditions that\u000a        make persons vulnerable to trafficking\". (F)\u000a    The work has also been instrumental in providing an evidence base for\u000a        NGOs lobbying for trafficking to be understood as a product of\u000a      restrictive immigration controls, and not merely organised criminality or\u000a      demand for prostitution (A, G, H).\u000a    Influencing the work of NGOs on child migration\u000a      In addition to influencing international NGOs addressing trafficking in\u000a      general, the work of NGOs on child trafficking has also been\u000a      informed by the research. O'Connell Davidson's work on children's agency\u000a      within migration and the identified need to build resilience among migrant\u000a      children to protect themselves against trafficking and exploitation was\u000a      the focus and starting point for a discussion forum attended by 115\u000a      researchers and NGO representatives from across Europe at an NGO\u000a      conference on child migration. Participants considered how research can\u000a      `influence actual changes for children in migration', and a quote from\u000a      that report illustrates how this research has shifted thinking in the\u000a        field of migrating vulnerable people:\u000a    \"If [Anderson and O'Connell Davidson's] conclusions are correct, which\u000a        I think they are, we have to ask ourselves if we, as NGOs, have accepted\u000a        simplifications in analysing root causes and effects of migration based\u000a        on binaries such as, internal versus international migration, voluntary\u000a        versus forced, temporary versus permanent, legal versus illegal and so\u000a        on. And that we by accepting those simplifications may have fed\u000a        ineffective means and even advocated for inadequate solutions for\u000a        children in migration. Further, we might have focused too much on media\u000a        coverage and funding results\". (I)\u000a    These comments signalled a change in NGOs' attitudes and approach to\u000a        child trafficking that was informed and influenced by the research\u000a      and which continues to the present day (J). The research has also informed\u000a      the design of a multi-country initiative (GATE project) working with child\u000a      migrants funded by the Italian branch of the charity `Defence for Children\u000a      International' (J) and O'Connell Davidson has been invited to act as a\u000a      scientific advisor on this project as the expert in the field.\u000a    Actively informing and changing attitudes\u000a      O'Connell Davidson has actively raised awareness of issues concerning\u000a      children, trafficking, and migration among UK and European government\u000a      officials, policy makers, law enforcers, non- governmental organisations\u000a      and trade unions. O'Connell Davidson spoke on trafficking at the RCUK All\u000a      Party Group for Global Uncertainties, House of Commons, November\u000a      2012. The research was cited by the Council of Europe in the\u000a      background paper (K) for a conference on preventing trafficking in human\u000a      beings in Bulgaria, December 2012, which brought together around 130\u000a      Ministers, civil servants, law enforcement agents, and non-governmental\u000a      actors from the 47 Council of Europe members States.\u000a    O'Connell Davidson was also invited to give a keynote address at this\u000a      conference and to run an expert workshop on the demand-side of\u000a      trafficking. In June 2013, she was invited to speak at the Organisation\u000a        for Security and Co-operation in Europe annual alliance against\u000a      trafficking conference (attended by more than 300 senior government\u000a      officials, national anti-trafficking rapporteurs, representatives from\u000a      NGOs, law enforcement agencies and trade unions) (L). She also gave a\u000a      keynote at the Dialogue Forum of the Austrian Government's\u000a        Anti-trafficking Regional Implementation Initiative in June 2013, a\u000a      meeting of around 50 governmental and non-governmental actors and law\u000a      enforcement officials from 15 European States (F).\u000a    The research also featured in media debate on prostitution policy.\u000a      O'Connell Davidson was invited to participate in a debate with Fiona\u000a        MacTaggert MP in the March 2008 edition of Prospect Magazine\u000a      (M) (circulation c.32,000); she appeared on More or Less, BBC\u000a      Radio 4 (c.1.4m listeners) on 9 January 2009 to debate the reliability\u000a        of statistics being cited by MPs pressing for criminalisation of the\u000a        purchase of sex, and her critique was reproduced in a Guardian\u000a      article (print circulation c.311,000) by Nick Davies on 20 October 2009\u000a      (N), who had approached O'Connell Davidson when researching the piece.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    O'Connell Davidson's pioneering research delivered the first systematic\u000a      study of the demand for prostitution and domestic work and contested\u000a      mainstream policy responses to human trafficking, childhood and migration.\u000a    Through adoption by international agencies, citation by leading global\u000a      organisations, speeches at international conferences and via media debate,\u000a      the research findings have been influential in informing UK legislation,\u000a      redefining the focus of international policy on human trafficking and\u000a      encouraging children's NGOs to adopt new approaches to child migration and\u000a      trafficking.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Nottingham\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Nottingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Nottingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10007154}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    The quality of underpinning research is evidenced by the fact that the\u000a      following outputs have been published in peer-reviewed journals or are the\u000a      result of a commissioned or peer-reviewed funding process.\u000a    Research outputs\u000a    \u000a1.

This study addressed conceptual and definitional\u000a        problems associated with the term `trafficking' and the tension\u000a      between States' concern to control borders and manage migration, and their\u000a      obligations to respect, protect and promote universal human and child\u000a      rights. This tension makes it difficult to draft and enforce\u000a        appropriate legislation intended to protect vulnerable adult and\u000a      child migrants. The research findings were published by Save the Children\u000a      Sweden and the International Organization for Migration (1).\u000a    Following this, O'Connell Davidson and Anderson developed the research\u000a      through an ESRC funded project in 2002-6 (7) on demand for migrant sex\u000a        and domestic workers in the UK and Spain. The project collected\u000a      interview and survey data from migrant domestic and sex workers, their\u000a      clients and employers, and non-migrants in comparable situations. As a\u000a      result it was able to shed novel light on the complexities and\u000a        contradictions which are actually present in this controversial field.\u000a      O'Connell Davidson focused primarily on prostitution (2, 3) and Anderson\u000a      on domestic work. Both projects addressed questions about trafficking of\u000a      children and adults.\u000a    In 2007 Save the Children Sweden commissioned O'Connell Davidson to\u000a      produce a report on child migration (8) that focused on child\u000a        trafficking in the broader context of migration in Europe and the\u000a      ways in which immigration regimes produce children's vulnerability to\u000a        exploitation and abuse (4, 5).\u000a    This corpus of research over a 6 year period challenged three key\u000a      assumptions concerning human trafficking.\u000a    \u000a      Conventional wisdom has approached trafficking as a criminal justice\u000a        issue, with policy makers assuming it primarily affected the sex sector\u000a        and could be combated through legislation to criminalise the purchase of\u000a        trafficked persons' labour\/services. The research revealed that\u000a        exploitation of migrant labour is not confined to the sex sector, but is\u000a        found in numerous sectors where there is demand for cheap and dependent\u000a        workers. This demand is shaped by a complex and interlocking set of\u000a        political, social, institutional and economic factors. Thus, it is difficult\u000a          to tackle demand for `trafficked' labour without addressing demand for\u000a          vulnerable and unprotected labour per se.\u000a      It has often been taken as self-evident that demand for prostitution\u000a        was a `root cause' of trafficking. However, interviews with sex workers\u000a        and their clients, and survey data revealed that customers were not a\u000a        homogeneous group in terms of their practices, interests or propensity\u000a        to pay for sex with children or with women forced into prostitution. A\u000a          `market' for the services of sex workers is not synonymous with a\u000a          `market' for the services of vulnerable migrant young women and\u000a          children.\u000a\u000a      O'Connell Davidson's work on children, trafficking, and migration\u000a        emphasises that children are not always forced to move by exploitative\u000a        adults but can be authors of their own migratory projects; and that\u000a        trafficking is not the only or primary risk to children who migrate. It\u000a        highlighted the many ways in which States are a source of harm to\u000a        children through their immigration policies. In particular the work has\u000a        identified ways in which describing certain forms of child migration\u000a          as `trafficking' might enable immigration control, but conflicts with\u000a          children's rights and interests.\u000a\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28491","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has influenced healthcare policy makers, changed practice\u000a      and raised awareness through conventional dissemination and the innovative\u000a      use of a play, Inside out of Mind, to communicate the\u000a      research findings directly to stakeholders.\u000a    The full report had been downloaded from the SDO website by\u000a        researchers and policymakers 369 times by 31 March 2012 (when\u000a      counting ceased). Schneider also spoke about the findings within the\u000a      `Delivering better health services' session at the 2010 SDO network. The\u000a      Royal College of Nursing hosted a webinar (web based seminar),\u000a      `Re-evaluating the role of the Health Care Assistant in dementia care' on\u000a      13 May 2010, which was attended by 40 nursing managers, workforce\u000a      planners, those involved in planning care for people with dementia and\u000a      their managers. The study has influenced commissioners of research who\u000a      have used its findings as the basis of further NIHR HS&amp;DR calls for\u000a      research into the delivery of care, e.g. (A).\u000a    In addition to reaching policy makers, it was felt important to disseminate\u000a        the research findings directly to HCAs themselves in order to reach\u000a      those to whom they are most relevant. The research findings were therefore\u000a      also published in The British Journal of Health Care Assistants\u000a      (5) which is the only UK journal intended for healthcare assistants.\u000a      The journal has a circulation of 5,000 and an estimated readership of some\u000a      25,000.\u000a    Inside out of Mind was conceived of as a way of portraying\u000a      the key research findings vividly and in an accessible way to the widest\u000a      possible audience. For example, the play's soliloquy of a nurse going off\u000a      duty after an exhausting night: \"I take all these voices home with me ...\"\u000a      powerfully presents the effects of the working environment on staff. The\u000a      challenge of the emotional climate is shown in the responses of patients\u000a      to noise and bustle, often seen through the eyes of the ethnographer\u000a      character, playing the role of the original fieldworkers. A scene\u000a      featuring a ward visit from a supercilious doctor, characterised as a\u000a      `tour de farce', humorously portrays to the audience many of the `us and\u000a      them' issues that are commonplace amongst unregistered staff including\u000a      HCAs.\u000a    The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) at the University of Nottingham\u000a      funded a Managed Innovation Network (MIN) (7) which brought together NHS\u000a      providers, research and arts leaders to explore production possibilities,\u000a      leading to a theatre workshop performance of excerpts from the script to\u000a      an invited audience in July 2011. Financial support from the University's\u000a      Science, Technology and Society Research Priority Group and the School (8)\u000a      enabled the production of a 10-minute documentary (B) about the\u000a      development of the workshop performance. This film has been presented\u000a        to 12 conference audiences totalling 800 people. The MIN used the\u000a      positive feedback on the workshop performance to seek financial support\u000a      (9), together with a great deal of support in kind from the NHS and\u000a      University of Nottingham to develop a full production. Funding was\u000a      secured from Comic Relief (10) for a video trailer (C) for the\u000a      full production. Inside Out of Mind had its premiere\u000a        run at the University's public arts centre, Lakeside, in June, 2013,\u000a        with 15 public performances, 8 of them reserved for local HCAs released\u000a        by their employers. These performances included a discussion\u000a        between the artistic team and the audience.\u000a    1,109 HCAs attended the play (D) and participated in discussions\u000a      and activities about dementia. Ninety-three per cent of participants\u000a      judged the day as `good', `very good' or `excellent', while 92% of the\u000a        participants who work with people with dementia felt that the experience\u000a        would have a positive impact on their work (E).\u000a    The impact of the play in stimulating HCAs' analysis and reflection of\u000a      their work is evident in their comments:\u000a    I have been working in dementia for some time and today's play gave me\u000a        more insight into dementia, quite inspiring... fantastic. (25\/1\/4)\u000a    Now have a better understanding of dementia. Brilliant day. (25\/4\/14)\u000a    It has been an amazing day. I have learnt that people with dementia\u000a        have feelings and I have learnt to appreciate how they must feel.\u000a        (25\/4\/18)\u000a    Wonderful, knowledgeable play, excellent for giving an insight to\u000a        people unaware of dementia and what can be experienced. Should be shown\u000a        nationwide. (26\/2\/07)\u000a    Participants were invited to specify how they intended to apply their\u000a        new insight to improve dementia care within their workplace, and 481\u000a      took up this opportunity, for example, to set themselves a goal:\u000a    Take time to look into their background to get a better understanding\u000a        of that person. (17\/6\/8)\u000a    To try to make less noise and to remember each patient as an\u000a        individual and treat them accordingly. (18\/1\/7)\u000a    To be understanding more and step back to evaluate the situation more,\u000a        we got to do this watching the play. (18\/3\/18)\u000a    The testimonies of HCAs can be found in a YouTube documentary, seen 799\u000a      times in the period 9 July-14 October 2013 (F).\u000a    The programme for the production was also designed with the needs of\u000a      family carers in mind so that it would provide information about where to\u000a      turn for help and advice. A free on-line resource (G),\u000a      funded by a philanthropic donation to the University's Impact campaign\u000a      (11), was created to bring together information about dementia care. The site\u000a        receives 100 new visits per week and has registered 500 users in the\u000a        first four months since it was launched in June 2013. Many of the\u000a      nearly 1000 people who came to the public performances had some connection\u000a      with health or social care, and the blogs posted by Francois Matarasso,\u000a      former chair of the Arts Council East Midlands (H), and Eileen Shepherd of\u000a      the Nursing Times (I), illustrate the impression made by the play on\u000a        an informed audience.\u000a    This original approach to research dissemination and the scope of the\u000a      play in working across the arts, health and academia, was highlighted in\u000a      an edition of the PM programme (J) and was featured on BBC TV\u000a        East Midlands Today (K). BBC Radio Nottingham interviewed\u000a      Professor Schneider and the director of the play, Tanya Myers twice: first\u000a      trailing the production, and then, during the run, they were joined by a\u000a      carer, Meryl, in a longer interview about the issue of dementia (L).\u000a    Plans are in hand for a national tour in 2014, in partnership\u000a      with the University of Nottingham, RCN Foundation Trust and NHS employers,\u000a      conditional on a Strategic Touring Fund grant from The Arts Council. A digital\u000a        recording is also planned which, in addition to use in care homes\u000a      and domestic settings, can be broadcast to cinemas and therefore widen\u000a      audience access, especially in remote and rural areas.\u000a    Funding\u000a    \u000a      Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham: &#163;5000\u000a      University of Nottingham Science, Technology and Society Research\u000a        Priority Group: &#163;2,200; School of Sociology and Social Policy: &#163;800\u000a      Royal College of Nursing Foundation Trust: &#163;52,000; The Arts Council:\u000a        &#163;10,000; NHS partners: &#163;84,000.\u000a      Comic Relief: &#163;3,000\u000a      University of Nottingham Impact Campaign: &#163;120,000\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The findings of an innovative ethnographic study of Health Care\u000a      Assistants (HCAs) who care for dementia patients were used to create a\u000a      stage play, Inside out of Mind,which was performed to\u000a      audiences of HCAs, NHS managers and the general public.\u000a    The performances raised awareness with NHS managers and healthcare policy\u000a      makers, of the role and importance of HCAs; their working environment, the\u000a      skills they need and the difficulties they encounter.

The research was intended to raise\u000a        the quality of care for dementia patients through greater understanding\u000a        of the working practices and conditions for NHS unregistered Health Care\u000a        Assistants (HCAs). Prior to this innovative participant observation\u000a      study, in which researchers worked as HCAs in hospital dementia wards,\u000a      immersing themselves in the role, very little empirical research into the\u000a      role of HCAs had been conducted. The full report is available on-line (1),\u000a      and the methodology (2), interdisciplinary issues (3) and the emotional\u000a      impact (4) have also been reported in peer-reviewed papers, with one\u000a      article in a journal for HCAs (5). The project has been short-listed\u000a        for the 2014 Times Higher Research Project of the Year.\u000a    The five key findings of the research are outlined below:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aMotivations and environment: The research identified that HCAs\u000a        undertook their work with warmth, empathy and commitment and derived\u000a        considerable satisfaction from improving patients' quality of life even\u000a        in small ways. However, it also revealed that the dementia ward can feel\u000a        a closed environment where the odd and disturbing are every-day. HCAs\u000a        recognise that to outsiders some of the things that occur must seem\u000a        shocking, and therefore difficult to share with friends and family. It\u000a        is important for policy makers and managers to understand the\u000a          motivations of staff and the effects of the working environment on\u000a          them.\u000a      \u000aManaging the emotional climate: HCAs manage the emotional\u000a        climate on the ward, stimulating patients when the atmosphere is dull\u000a        and calming things down when stress levels rise. The importance of\u000a          this function and the capability of HCAs in this regard may have been\u000a          underestimated and unacknowledged in previous research.\u000a      \u000aWorking with families: The interface between HCAs and informal\u000a        carers and\/or patients' families is vital and is an aspect of care that\u000a        deserves further attention and research. Whilst nurses provide clinical\u000a        information the HCAs provide minute detail about the patient's care and\u000a        condition. Communication with patients' families\/informal carers\u000a          could be problematic, often guarded and strained, because of the\u000a        potential for misunderstanding.\u000a      \u000aStress and coping: An essential requirement for an effective\u000a        HCA is to be able to achieve selective desensitisation in order to\u000a          cope with unpleasant tasks and personal abuse. While the newcomer\u000a        is bewildered by some of the surreal situations that arise, experienced\u000a        staff demonstrate coping strategies, including the use of humour to cope\u000a        with stressful aspects of the job.\u000a      \u000aTeam identity: The research found that belonging to and\u000a          participating in the team was a fundamental part of the HCA role.\u000a        The team empowers its members to manage their complex, changing and\u000a        stressful role; it compensates for limited recognition from outside, and\u000a        supports them emotionally. However, if staff prioritise the team over\u000a        patients, e.g. focussing on completing feeding efficiently during busy\u000a        periods, or if the team's self-reliance inhibits communication with the\u000a        rest of the multidisciplinary team, this clearly presents a risk to care\u000a        quality.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29289","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Supported by ESRC's Growing Older Programme 2000-2002, Scharf's research\u000a      continues to have an enduring impact on public policy\/practice. It has\u000a      been one of two highly influential pieces of research (out of over 100\u000a      pieces commissioned 2000-2009) that those working in the public sector\u000a      report referring to frequently to help them understand the social\u000a      exclusion challenges that older people face, and has been widely used to\u000a      shape policy making.\u000a    Initial findings from the Growing Older research published by\u000a      Help the Aged (Scharf et al., 2002) attracted media interest,\u000a      eliciting a formal response from the then Minister for Social Exclusion,\u000a      who described the research as `invaluable'. The Guardian's\u000a      Assistant Editor suggested that ministers\/policymakers pay particular\u000a      attention to the study's findings [source 1]. Then followed an invitation\u000a      by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to review the impact of\u000a      government policies on older people vulnerable to social exclusion\u000a      (Phillipson &amp; Scharf, 2004). This led the Social Exclusion Unit to\u000a      identify `excluded older people' as a key target group for service\u000a      innovation, with Scharf et al. (2005) informing the resultant key\u000a      government strategy A Sure Start to Later Life [source 2]. This\u000a      advocated a new approach to service provision for older people and led to\u000a      the development of a range of two-year (until mid-2008) Link-age Plus\u000a      projects providing a `one-stop-shop' for advice and services in a bid to\u000a      combat isolation and promote well-being. Ultimately it led to a range of\u000a      recommendations to local authorities about how they could best link older\u000a      people to services [source 3]. The Local Government Association report All\u000a        our Tomorrows [source 4] cites evidence from Scharf on the number of\u000a      pensions not being drawn. This report is still shaping Local Government\u000a      strategy around ageing, for example it is drawn on by Lancashire's ageing\u000a      strategy to 2025 [source 5].\u000a    Arising from the Growing Older research, related work was\u000a      commissioned by the Commission for Rural Communities (Scharf &amp;\u000a      Bartlam, 2006) and by Help the Aged (Scharf et al., 2006), which\u000a      the Department for Work and Pensions drew on to develop a set of material\u000a      deprivation indicators better suited to the situation of older people.\u000a      These were tested in an Office of National Statistics Omnibus Survey and\u000a      have since been added (in 2008 &#8212; continuing in 2013) [source 6] to the\u000a      annual Family Resources Surveys (FRS). The FRS is a major survey; its\u000a      results are used to shape government policy around income and benefits;\u000a      the material deprivation work was taken up in a report by Stephen Mackay\u000a      for DWP [source 7].\u000a    Most recently, in 2012, Scharf's Growing Older work (with Victor)\u000a      has been used in the Government White paper Caring for our Future:\u000a        reforming care and support [source 8] to identify the high levels of\u000a      loneliness felt by older people and that this is an important\u000a      consideration for providing for future needs. In this context, Scharf's\u000a      research formed the very basis for the launch of the Campaign to End\u000a        Loneliness in 2011. This launch was preceded by his providing the\u000a      originators of the Campaign with relevant material to ensure that the\u000a      Campaign was truly evidence-based. Founded by four partner NGOs, the\u000a      central aims of the Campaign are to identify the causes of loneliness in\u000a      later life, identify what works in reducing this loneliness and campaign\u000a      for this action, and to create a vision for the future where loneliness is\u000a      not an issue. The Campaign states that Scharf's work has been distinctive\u000a      and a factor in the success of its work. They cite their key success to\u000a      date as being the Care Services Minister adopting the issue of loneliness,\u000a      commissioning funded work on a toolkit for Health and Wellbeing Boards,\u000a      and putting loneliness as a measurement area into the adult social care\u000a      outcomes framework. Information from the Campaign is also used in much\u000a      media coverage of the issue, with the profile of loneliness being\u000a      significantly raised in the public press since the Campaign's launch [for\u000a      example, source 9].\u000a    Alongside work relating to national policy making, the social exclusion\u000a      research has influenced the development of local ageing policies,\u000a      particularly since 2004 through collaboration with Manchester City Council\u000a      (MCC). The ESRC study was used by MCC to develop the city's first ageing\u000a      strategy (MCC, 2004) and, with further involvement by Scharf, has since\u000a      contributed to the shaping of an innovative and forward-looking strategy\u000a      aimed at making Manchester a `great place to grow older' (MCC, 2009).\u000a      During this period Scharf was a member of the city's Ageing Strategy\u000a      Expert Advisory Panel, along with other notable research and practice\u000a      leaders. Their developing relationship has resulted in numerous joint\u000a      initiatives between Keele and MCC, including several of the projects that\u000a      have been implemented as a result of the ageing strategy. The CALL-ME\u000a      study involved developing a series of initiatives across four\u000a      disadvantaged communities in Manchester. For example, a gardening project\u000a      in Moss Side was implemented with Scharf playing an active role in\u000a      engaging local residents across the generations in the creation and\u000a      development of the garden, the existence of which has also provided a\u000a      sense of pride to Moss Side &#8212; an inner city area previously viewed\u000a      negatively by others (Community Garden Member, Sept 2009) and with high\u000a      levels of social deprivation. As indicated by the research findings of the\u000a      project, the participatory nature of the research had an impact on the\u000a      research participants, leading to their improved physical and social\u000a      well-being.\u000a    These small-scale projects with direct impacts on the lives of those in\u000a      Manchester were brought together at an event at Manchester Town Hall in\u000a      2009, at which Scharf presented research findings to those involved in\u000a      many of the projects &#8212; academics, practitioners, and older people (over\u000a      200 people in total). This event provided a forum for discussion and point\u000a      of connection across the city, strengthening each of the projects. This\u000a      was just one of many such events that Scharf has contributed to in this\u000a      capacity. The age-friendly cities strategy has been adopted by local\u000a      councils across the UK (for example in Newcastle, Glasgow and Cardiff),\u000a      with Manchester City Council being an active member of the age-friendly\u000a      cities network, which is affiliated to the World Health Organization's\u000a      Global Network of Age-friendly Cities and Communities, that facilitates\u000a      the sharing of best practice [source 10]. Manchester was also involved in\u000a      the first global conference on age-friendly cities in Dublin in 2011,\u000a      with Scharf also contributing on the theme of older adult loneliness, and\u000a      so has contributed more broadly to age-friendly developments in the\u000a      international arena.\u000a    Drawing on the increasingly close relationship with Manchester City\u000a      Council, Keele subsequently piloted educational programmes aimed at\u000a      engaging older people in the study of ageing and, latterly, developing the\u000a      skills base of staff involved in delivering services to older people. The\u000a      positive pilot project review, founded on a series of focus groups with\u000a      key stakeholders [source 11], has led to the formalisation of an on-going\u000a      certified Ageing Studies Programme. The programme in Manchester has now\u000a      run four times and involved over 100 participants from the public,\u000a      independent and voluntary sector in interdisciplinary CPD. Funding was\u000a      achieved via the Department for Work and Pensions which also meant that\u000a      the programme was rolled out and delivered to the Wirral (35\u000a      participants), York (25 participants), Stoke (30 participants) and, again,\u000a      to Manchester. Feedback from participants has been very positive, with\u000a      many saying the course challenged their beliefs and ways of working with\u000a      older people and, for example, has led them to seek out and pay greater\u000a      attention to the opinions of the older people they work with [source 12].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken at Keele has made the social exclusion of older\u000a      people visible to opinion- leaders and policy makers, helping to shape\u000a      their perceptions of ageing.

This was the first study of its kind to\u000a      focus exclusively on exploring the experiences of older people living in\u000a      some of England's most disadvantaged urban communities. In terms of its\u000a      strong place focus, the study drew on the experience of the Keele social\u000a      gerontology group in an earlier ESRC-funded study that explored aspects of\u000a      older people's family relationships (Phillipson et al., 2001). The\u000a      mixed-methods study, involving a survey of 600 people aged 60 and over,\u000a      in-depth interviews with 130 older people, and a series of group\u000a      discussions, was undertaken in parts of London, Liverpool and Manchester.\u000a      The unique nature of the data, in particular the often powerful accounts\u000a      of many older people's daily experiences of poverty, social isolation,\u000a      loneliness, crime, and urban change, provided new and striking insights\u000a      into the lives of some of the UK's most disadvantaged citizens (Scharf et\u000a        al., 2002; Scharf et al., 2005a; Scharf et al.,\u000a      2005b). Further, qualitative, work was then commissioned to explore\u000a      similar issues in rural communities (Scharf &amp; Bartlam, 2006), and to\u000a      develop material deprivation indicators better suited to disadvantaged\u000a      older people (Scharf et al., 2006).\u000a    The focus on ageing in disadvantaged communities continued to attract\u000a      highly competitive funding. In partnership with Manchester City Council, a\u000a      multi-disciplinary team from Keele (led by Michael Murray with Sian\u000a      Maslin-Prothero, Roger Beech and Thomas Scharf as Co-Investigators) was\u000a      awarded &#163;334,281 under the cross-council New Dynamics of Ageing programme\u000a      to conduct a major study from 2008-2011 that has sought to identify ways\u000a      of better engaging older people in their local communities. Conducted in\u000a      four socially deprived neighbourhoods in Manchester, the CALL-ME\u000a      (Community Action in Later Life &#8212; Manchester Engagement) study adopted a\u000a      participatory action research design to assess the degree to which\u000a      contrasting initiatives succeeded in encouraging older people's community\u000a      participation. It found that active participation by older people in\u000a      designing, planning and implementing community arts projects, exercise\u000a      programmes, and physical environment enhancement schemes (through\u000a      gardening projects) improved social and physical well-being of both older\u000a      people and their communities (Buffel et al., 2012; Beech &amp;\u000a      Murray, 2013)\u000a    The work on inclusion and exclusion in later life, and that on other\u000a      themes in social gerontology, has been supported at Keele by an\u000a      institutional commitment to develop ageing as a research priority. This\u000a      has included establishing the University's work on Active Ageing as a\u000a      context for research and education in relation to ageing populations.\u000a    Researchers: Professor Thomas Scharf; Professor Chris Phillipson\u000a      (at Keele until 2012); Bernadette Bartlam &#8212; Research Fellow\/Lecturer;\u000a      Maureen Ray &#8212; Research Assistant, Lecturer, and Senior Lecturer; Professor\u000a      Michael Murray; Professor Sian Maslin-Prothero (Honorary Professor); Tine\u000a      Buffel &#8212; Research Fellow at Keele until 2012; and Roger Beech &#8212; Reader.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30140","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Sim's analysis of penality has attempted to hold to account politicians,\u000a      policy makers and prison\u000a      staff through interrogating the impact of their respective roles and\u000a      responsibilities on the\u000a      experiences of for prisoners and their families (5a-h). Indeed a\u000a      representative of the HM\u000a      Inspectorate of Prisons (5e) has lauded Sim's scholarship as providing\u000a      `the kind of concise,\u000a      articulate and powerful critique of apparent criminological realities,\u000a      which is necessary to motivate\u000a      genuine reform and can help to ensure that practitioners and others do not\u000a      forget the big picture'\u000a      (Bhui, 2010:94). The Governor of HMP Grendon (5d) notes that the\u000a      intellectual attention that Sim's\u000a      work has brought to the issue of deaths in custody has contributed to `a\u000a      climate' that has not only\u000a      enabled significant improvements in the processes for managing prisoners\u000a      who are at risk of\u000a      suicide and self-harm, but also raised the public profile of this issue so\u000a      that it has been necessary\u000a      for these improvements to take place. For example, HMP Grendon's suicide\u000a      and self-harm\u000a      prevention policy is subject to regular review and the institution was\u000a      described by the HM Chief\u000a      Inspector of prisons, in 2011, as a `fundamentally safe prison' which,\u000a      given the nature of its\u000a      population, is `a significant achievement'.\u000a    While impact can sometimes be traced directly in terms of a causal link\u000a      between research\u000a      conducted and public policy, academic impact on social policy can also be\u000a      traced through\u000a      proactive involvement in policy making processes which subsequently feed\u000a      into the broader policy\u000a      and popular debates in an area of significant public concern. In Sim's\u000a      case, there is evidence to\u000a      suggest that his research has been beneficial through making a distinct\u000a      and material contribution to\u000a      INQUEST's campaign activities and, by association, to the policy processes\u000a      and reforms which\u000a      have emerged directly as a result of the charity's campaigns (5a,b,c,f).\u000a    INQUEST is a small charitable organisation which provides a specialist,\u000a      comprehensive advice\u000a      service on contentious deaths and their investigation to a range of key\u000a      stakeholders. INQUEST\u000a      provide briefings for Parliamentarians, policy makers, the media, legal\u000a      representatives and other\u000a      interested parties including penal reform groups. Thus these stakeholders,\u000a      alongside bereaved\u000a      families, comprise the key beneficiaries with respect to the impact of\u000a      INQUEST's work.\u000a      INQUEST's recognition of the significance of Sim's research led to him to\u000a      become involved with\u000a      the organisation initially as a member of the charity's advisory board and\u000a      subsequently, via an\u000a      interview process, as a Trustee of the charity. In this role his research,\u000a      expertise and critical\u000a      criminological perspective has contributed directly to INQUEST policy with\u000a      respect to deaths of\u000a      children and women in custody while his critiques of penal policy and\u000a      practice, and his\u000a      championing of progressive reforms, have enabled him to play a key role in\u000a      helping to strategically\u000a      guide INQUEST's highly effective evidence based campaigning alongside\u000a      families to secure a\u000a      number of significant policy successes and changes to the legal landscape.\u000a    These reforms include the establishment of independent investigation\u000a      processes following\u000a      deaths in police custody and in prison and legislative reform including\u000a      the Corporate Manslaughter\u000a      and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, enacted in 2011, which lifts crown\u000a      immunity from the prison\u000a      service in relation to custodial deaths, and the Coroners and Justice Act\u000a      2009 which is notable for\u000a      successfully saving the post of Chief Coroner. These policy reforms were\u000a      accomplished at the\u000a      same time as successfully campaigning to elicit cross party opposition\u000a      against government\u000a      proposals to introduce secret inquests: firstly in the Counter Terrorism\u000a      Bill 2008: secondly in the\u000a      Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and most recently in the Justice and\u000a      Security Green Paper 2012.\u000a    In additional to his academic expertise on penal policy, Sim provided\u000a      practical help to support\u000a      INQUEST's campaigns on these issues (5a, b). For example his attendance at\u000a      board meetings has\u000a      ensured his research has helped to formulate and develop INQUEST's\u000a      policies and approach; he\u000a      has written briefing papers for the charity (2008); he has commented on\u000a      INQUEST's briefings to\u000a      policy makers, practitioners, and the media; and he has offered advice to\u000a      INQUEST's case workers\u000a      and Co-Directors via email and telephone discussions.\u000a    It has also been a mark of Sim's work that he has attempted to\u000a      disseminate it to the widest\u000a      possible practitioner and popular audience. He has had a number of letters\u000a      published in the\u000a      Guardian relating to penal and wider criminal justice matters (1 July\u000a      2012; 19th July 2011; 14th\u000a      April 2009, with others). He has utilised other media outlets for\u000a      dissemination purposes such as:\u000a      documentaries (See Punishment: A Failed Social Experiment, October\u000a      2013 which was listed as one\u000a      of the top 100 documentaries 'inspiring the shift to a sustainable\u000a      paradigm'); blogs (October 2012);\u000a      and writing for Criminal Justice Matters, a journal that is concerned with\u000a      engaging with practitioners\u000a      (March, 2010; December, 2010; September, 2012; June 2013).

This, in\u000a      turn, led him into the debates around deaths in custody more generally and\u000a      to his involvement with\u000a      the charity INQUEST, first as a member of its advisory board and\u000a      subsequently as a Trustee.\u000a      Overall, his work has been built on a number of interrelated themes:\u000a    i. Providing critical commentary on penal policy and practice,\u000a      particularly with regard to the\u000a      delivery of prison health care and interrogating deaths in custody through\u000a      a rigorous\u000a      deconstruction of historical and contemporary state documents;\u000a      ii. Articulating the challenges posed to official\/dominant discourses of\u000a      punishment and penal\u000a      policy by prisoners' rights organisations thereby providing an alternative\u000a      account of prison\u000a      reality from below;\u000a    iii. Confronting the stigmatisation and `othering' of prisoners and\u000a      prisoners' families as well as\u000a      the 'othering' of those prison staff interested in rehabilitation and\u000a      reform;\u000a    iv. Suggesting reforms which have sought to impact on the delivery of\u000a      penal policy, making it\u000a      more effective and accountable.\u000a    Sim's scholarship has developed critical and historically informed\u000a      theoretical insights concerning\u000a      imprisonment and, in particular, the central, but contradictory, role of\u000a      the state in shaping and\u000a      legitimating penal order. His research demonstrates that underlying prison\u000a      priorities of order,\u000a      security, discipline and classification are regimes which are often\u000a      alienating, harsh and harrowing\u000a      for many of the confined; that these priorities undermine the efforts of\u000a      progressive prison staff to\u000a      engage humanely and empathetically with prisoners and that such regimes\u000a      have, in some cases,\u000a      contributed to deaths in custody. A central theme has been the recognition\u000a      that while popular and\u000a      academic debates point to the profound political, economic and social\u000a      changes that have occurred\u000a      since the 1970s, the justifications mobilised to defend the continuing\u000a      existence of prisons, the\u000a      populations it incapacitates and its often detrimental policy\u000a      interventions, have remained consistent\u000a      since the late eighteenth century. (See Sim, 2008a, 2008b and 2009).\u000a    Sim's work has contributed to, and been instrumental in developing, a\u000a      more critically engaged\u000a      and interventionist public criminology through highlighting the\u000a      experiences of some of society's\u000a      most vulnerable groups and signposting ways to develop humane policy\u000a      responses (see Sim, 2009\u000a      and Cooper and Sim, 2013). Historically, his engagement with the wider\u000a      policy community can be\u000a      seen in a number of different arenas: his invitation to deliver the annual\u000a      Perrie Lecture in 1994; his\u000a      membership of the North West Healthy Prisons Task Force in 2001; and his\u000a      membership of the\u000a      External Advisory Group for the Cabinet Office's highly regarded report on\u000a      Reducing Re-Offending by\u000a      Ex-Prisoners published in 2002.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30247","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of Tombs' work is the product of its long-term, sustained\u000d\u000a      quality, its policy-relevance,\u000d\u000a      and his commitment to disseminate this work beyond academia. The impacts\u000d\u000a      that follow\u000d\u000a      from this are changes in the attitudes, awareness and understandings on\u000d\u000a      the part of organisations\u000d\u000a      of the actual scale of the problem and its effects and the poverty of\u000d\u000a      state responses to occupational\u000d\u000a      death and injury. Most fundamentally, impact is being claimed for how this\u000d\u000a      body of work, as\u000d\u000a      opposed to any specific piece of output, represents a long-term challenge\u000d\u000a      to conventional wisdom\u000d\u000a      (5 a-i). The key pathway to impact during this period has been Tombs'\u000d\u000a      association with the CCA.\u000d\u000a      The CCA was established as a charity in 1999, by Tombs and colleagues, to\u000d\u000a      promote worker and\u000d\u000a      public safety. Tombs was Chair of the Board of Directors of CCA from its\u000d\u000a      inception and remained\u000d\u000a      as Chair until it closed, due to financial constraints, in September 2009,\u000d\u000a      when it employed four staff\u000d\u000a      members (2.5 FTEs). The CCA generated approximately &#163;1.6million across its\u000d\u000a      ten year existence.\u000d\u000a      Tombs' role in forming the CCA itself attests to his widely recognised\u000d\u000a      research expertise in the\u000d\u000a      areas which are the subject of this impact statement. Moreover, as a small\u000d\u000a      organisation, Tombs\u000d\u000a      was intimately involved in all aspects of its work.\u000d\u000a    The CCA's earliest activities were policy-related research, which formed\u000d\u000a      the basis for various\u000d\u000a      campaigning activities. Tombs was involved in producing a series of key\u000d\u000a      research reports for the\u000d\u000a      CCA &#8212; on safety law enforcement, directors' duties, and levers for law\u000d\u000a      compliance, mostly funded\u000d\u000a      by trades unions, some by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The CCA\u000d\u000a      quickly established its\u000d\u000a      reputation as a key source of research and expertise on matters of\u000d\u000a      occupational safety regulation,\u000d\u000a      and was routinely engaged in formal and informal interventions into law\u000d\u000a      and policy, which included\u000d\u000a      an ongoing engagement with senior civil servants and ministers (5a,b,c,g).\u000d\u000a      The CCA was certainly\u000d\u000a      central in interventions leading to the passage of the Corporate\u000d\u000a      Manslaughter and Corporate\u000d\u000a      Homicide Act, which came into force in April 2008, and, subsequently\u000d\u000a      provided training (recognised\u000d\u000a      by the Law Society) to the law firms involved in prosecuting corporate\u000d\u000a      manslaughter cases derived\u000d\u000a      from their briefing paper on this Act. The CCA successfully campaigned for\u000d\u000a      numerous changes in\u000d\u000a      HSE policy and practice. For example, the CCA argued that prosecutions\u000d\u000a      should not be delayed by\u000d\u000a      iinquests, and acceptance of this is reflected in the HSE's 2011\u000d\u000a      publication `Work-related deaths: A\u000d\u000a      protocol for liaison' [para 103] (5 a, b, c). Likewise the CCA argued that\u000d\u000a      the maintenance and\u000d\u000a      publication of work related deaths was one basis for accountability, and\u000d\u000a      from 2008 the HSE has\u000d\u000a      published the names and details relating to reported work related deaths\u000d\u000a      (5 a, b, d) (see\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk\/foi\/fatalities\/in-year-names.htm).\u000d\u000a      Finally with regard to the CCA, Tombs'\u000d\u000a      work on the problems of state responses to occupational deaths was of\u000d\u000a      significance in establishing\u000d\u000a      the CCA's Work-Related Death Advisory Service (WRDAS) which provided free\u000d\u000a      legal advice to\u000d\u000a      families bereaved from work-related deaths to facilitate the investigation\u000d\u000a      and prosecution\u000d\u000a      processes arising from these deaths. The CCA's annual case load of 40-60\u000d\u000a      cases indicates\u000d\u000a      significant social impact which earned the charity the Law Society Quality\u000d\u000a      Mark (5 b).\u000d\u000a    The significance of Tombs' work is reflected in the recognition by\u000d\u000a      Hazards, CCJS, IER, FACK,\u000d\u000a      TUC and various unions that his reconstructions of official occupational\u000d\u000a      fatality data are the `real'\u000d\u000a      figure, a fact obliquely noted by HSE itself (5 c, d, f, g, h, i).\u000d\u000a      Further, his research work is the\u000d\u000a      standard academic reference point used in campaigning NGO material to\u000d\u000a      highlight how trends\u000d\u000a      towards the `light touch' regulation of business have in effect\u000d\u000a      `decriminalised' death and injury at\u000d\u000a      work, while senior regulators consistently recognise the need to defend\u000d\u000a      such trends in the light of\u000d\u000a      Tombs' data and analysis. For example, the HSE discussed specific research\u000d\u000a      outputs at Board\u000d\u000a      level (HSE\/10\/60 on 28\/07\/10). Tombs' research has also reached formal\u000d\u000a      policy-making levels. For\u000d\u000a      example, Crisis of Enforcement was launched at a House of Commons\u000d\u000a      meeting attended by 55\u000d\u000a      people, chaired by Katy Clarke MP (18\/06\/08), following which an Early Day\u000d\u000a      Motion no. 1855 was\u000d\u000a      tabled by MPs on its content (EDM 1855) on 23\/06\/08 and Tombs has provided\u000d\u000a      written and oral\u000d\u000a      evidence to relevant Parliamentary Committees, most recently in regard to\u000d\u000a      the 2013 Lofstedt\u000d\u000a      Review of Health and Safety.\u000d\u000a    More generally, Tombs has a long term working relationship with the\u000d\u000a      Institute of Employment\u000d\u000a      Rights (IER), a think tank for the labour movement, which commissioned and\u000d\u000a      published Regulatory\u000d\u000a        Surrender in July 2010, with a launch event involving a debate with\u000d\u000a      HSE's Head of Enforcement\u000d\u000a      and also the Head of PROSPECT (5 f, g, h, i). IER also published \"Health\u000d\u000a      and Safety Gone Mad?\"\u000d\u000a      in July 2010, a briefing paper for trades unions to use in their health\u000d\u000a      and safety campaigns and in\u000d\u000a      their preparation for, and response to, the Young (2010) and then Lofstedt\u000d\u000a      (2013) reviews of health\u000d\u000a      and safety regulation (5 f, g, h, i). Tombs and Whyte were also\u000d\u000a      commissioned to write a response\u000d\u000a      (published 25\/11\/10) to the Law Commission's Consultation Paper Criminal\u000d\u000a        Liability in Regulatory\u000d\u000a        Context, drawing upon the data and argument within Regulatory\u000d\u000a        Surrender, and Tombs has\u000d\u000a      participated in many debates, symposia and conferences organised by the\u000d\u000a      IER (for example,\u000d\u000a      24\/06\/08, 13\/07\/10).\u000d\u000a    This recognition has generated invitations to write trades\u000d\u000a      union-sponsored publications; to\u000d\u000a      speak at conferences, campaign meetings and members' workshops (the\u000d\u000a      latter, especially, with\u000d\u000a      trades union appointed safety reps), and having his work summarised in\u000d\u000a      trades union press\u000d\u000a      releases, campaign materials and policy statements (5 a-i). For example,\u000d\u000a      Tombs has shared\u000d\u000a      platforms with many senior Labour Movement figures and at key fora,\u000d\u000a      including: the Labour Party\u000d\u000a      Conference with Ken Livingstone and John MacLean (General Secretary, GMB)\u000d\u000a      to speak on\u000d\u000a      Regulatory Surrender, 28\/09\/10, and previously on various aspects\u000d\u000a      of his work with Brendan\u000d\u000a      Barber (TUC); Ian Tasker (STUC); Hope Daley (UNISON); Susan Murray and Rob\u000d\u000a      Miguel (Unite);\u000d\u000a      Neil Hope-Collins, Steve Kay and Mike MacDonald (PROSPECT's HSE branch),\u000d\u000a      and Labour Peer\u000d\u000a      Baroness Donaghy. The Trades Union Co-ordinating Group's briefing paper\u000d\u000a      for its nine constituent\u000d\u000a      unions, Big Society, Savage Cuts uses A Crisis of Enforcement\u000d\u000a      as its source for its `Workplace\u000d\u000a      Health and Safety' section, while Alan Ritchie, general secretary of\u000d\u000a      construction union UCATT,\u000d\u000a      claimed in 2008 that it was a \"grim wake up call for the HSE...\".

Both were developed collaboratively by researchers and participants\u000d      from the qualitative stages of the research, with practitioners and young\u000d      people assisting in the structure, form and content of the guides. As is\u000d      usual with outputs from government funded research, both guides were peer\u000d      reviewed by academics, practitioners and civil servants in the DCSF\u000d      Project Advisory Group.\u000d    The guide for young people won the Plain English Campaign 2010 `Plain\u000d      English' annual award. The research findings and guides have been\u000d      disseminated widely, with presentations by Stein (http:\/\/php.york.ac.uk\/inst\/spru\/profiles\/msC.php)\u000d      and by Hicks, to policy, practice and academic audiences.\u000d    Recent examples include the invited keynote presentations and two\u000d      workshops given by Hicks, commissioned by East Dunbarton Child Protection\u000d      Committee, at the `GETTING IT RIGHT for Children and Young People [GIRFEC]\u000d      in East Dunbartonshire' multi-agency training event held for practitioners\u000d      in Glasgow, November 2012. GIRFEC is a new national initiative that\u000d      promotes multi-agency working and accountability, and underpins all\u000d      Scottish Government policies for children and young people.\u000d    2) National policy influence: the multi-agency guide, Neglect\u000d        Matters, was published by DCSF (4,000 copies) and distributed to all\u000d      local authorities, with downloadable links provided on the Every Child\u000d        Matters website. The publication was launched at a Centre for\u000d      Excellence and Outcomes in Children and Young People's Services (C4EO)\u000d      event, alongside the launch of the 2010 edition of the extensive\u000d      government guidance, Working Together to Safeguard Children: a guide\u000d        to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children,\u000d      in which the adolescent neglect project was cited.\u000d    In June 2010, the Secretary of State for Education commissioned a review\u000d      of child protection, which heralds a radical shift from previous reforms (The\u000a        Munro Review of Child Protection: Final Report &#8212; A child-centred system,\u000d      Department for Education (2011)).

Hicks and Flynn worked in partnership with eight\u000d      multi-agency senior managers to consider the relevance of the research\u000d      findings to their own settings, with the action research goal of\u000d      implementing changes in local awareness, practice and policy. The LA\u000d      District Management Team were keen to work with our innovative approach to\u000d      service development, and agreed to the release of staff time with a view\u000d      to establishing potential for change in participants' own practice and in\u000d      local policy. Initially, five workshops were held with eight senior\u000d      managers from the range of children's services. The sessions were based on\u000d      a utilisation model developed by a regional hub of the national research\u000d      dissemination\/utilisation federation, Making Research Count,\u000d      involving:\u000d    \u000d      fitting the research findings to participants' own areas of practice\u000d        and policy, establishing the implications for individual agencies and\u000d        for the LA in making changes to practice;\u000d      identifying the potential for the development of practice and policy\u000d        within participants' own jurisdiction, establishing goals for change;\u000d      devising plans to enable change, implementing, monitoring and\u000d        reviewing progress.\u000d    \u000d    To create changes in practice and policy managers were enabled to\u000d      develop short guides to adolescent neglect for staff working in different\u000d      agencies, e.g. substance abuse and counselling. Safeguarding Screening\u000d      Tools approved by the LSCB were revised to include adolescent neglect and\u000d      are currently in use throughout the LA. Follow-up interviews with\u000d      individual managers established the nature of changes in practice and\u000d      policies, examples of which include: cultural shifts ensuing from the\u000d      recognition of `adolescent neglect' as a term for use; the inclusion of\u000d      neglect in assessments of older children and their families; and\u000d      monitoring data on adolescent neglect being collected by the LA\u000d      performance team.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The research addressed the lack of insight from research, policy and\u000d      practice in relation to adolescents who are neglected within families.\u000d      Findings have informed policy development at a national level, and were\u000d      the basis of a guide to good practice, published and circulated widely by\u000d      the (then) Department for Children Schools and Families ((DCSF), now the\u000d      Department for Education (DfE)), and a guide for young people to increase\u000d      their awareness of neglect, published and circulated by the National\u000d      Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

This was part of the government's response following\u000d      the Inquiry after the death of Victoria Climbi&#233; and later, Peter Connelly.\u000d      The conduit between researchers and national policy makers was integral to\u000d      the projects supported; a DCSF\/DH programme of seminars and workshops\u000d      enabled an ongoing working dialogue.\u000d    In the UK, neglect is the most common initial reason for being the\u000d      subject of a child protection plan, accounting for 41.9 per cent in the\u000d      year ending 31 March 2012 (DfE, Children Looked After in England\u000d        (including adoption and care leavers), Statistical First Release,\u000d      20\/2012).

The framework from the review was taken forward into the\u000d      qualitative research with young people and multi-agency professionals. \u000d    Findings\u000d    Core findings from the three stages of the project included:\u000d    \u000d      neglected young people initially come to the attention of\u000d        professionals via a diverse range of systems, e.g. education, health and\u000d        youth justice, as well as social care;\u000d      successful multi-agency working is a pre-requisite for effectively\u000d        meeting the needs of such young people, and this presents challenges\u000d        (e.g. for those engaged in practice, in the development of policy, and\u000d        for academics concerned with the well-being of youth);\u000d      there is a need for a re-examination of current definitions of neglect\u000d        in the light of age-related distinctions and perspectives;\u000d      correspondingly, a fuller understanding is needed among practitioners,\u000d        policy makers and researchers of the particular needs of adolescents who\u000d        are experiencing neglect;\u000d      there is a risk of persistent neglect becoming `normalised', with an\u000d        ongoing corrosive effect on well-being, while not quite reaching\u000d        accepted thresholds for intervention;\u000d      the above risk may be heightened due to differences in professionals'\u000d        conceptualisations of neglect for different age groups of children and\u000d        young people;\u000d      in relation to multi-agency practice, establishing frameworks and\u000d        processes that aid communication and collaboration between professionals\u000d        from different disciplines is vital;\u000d      there is a lack of research about neglectful parenting and the\u000d        behaviour of young people;\u000d      there is limited knowledge about interventions with neglected\u000d        adolescents.\u000d    \u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31954","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a      The report from the research on medical governance across selected\u000d\u000a        countries (2005\/6) was peer\u000d\u000a        reviewed and rated as good. It had a clear impact on the Chief Medical\u000d\u000a        Officer's report (Donaldson\u000d\u000a        2006). The CMO wrote to Allsop saying, `I found your report on medical\u000d\u000a        regulation in its\u000d\u000a        international context rigorous, stimulating and useful and feel it added\u000d\u000a        to the richness of my report'.\u000d\u000a        The research report was made available on the CMO's website and, by\u000d\u000a        agreement, the University\u000d\u000a        of Lincoln website (Allsop and Jones 2006). The research was supported\u000d\u000a        by, and has been\u000d\u000a        referred to and used by, Sir Donald Irvine, lately president of the\u000d\u000a        Picker Institute, a European-wide\u000d\u000a        agency that promotes patient-centred health care.\u000d\u000a      The research had a distinct and material impact on the CMO's report\u000d\u000a        (Department of Health 2006).\u000d\u000a        Chapter Six reported the research and its findings, as well as the\u000d\u000a        recommendations drawn from it.\u000d\u000a        On page 112, the CMO's (2006) report states: `Much of the content... is\u000d\u000a        based on Professor\u000d\u000a        Allsop's findings'. The report itself is still available on the\u000d\u000a        Department of Health website, as well as\u000d\u000a        the re-publication in 2012. Specific recommendations in the report that\u000d\u000a        used the research findings\u000d\u000a        were:\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        recommendation 11 (in dealing with poor performance the\u000d\u000a          investigatory functions of the\u000d\u000a          GMC should be separated from adjudication);\u000d\u000a        recommendation 26 (a system for regular revalidation should be\u000d\u000a          introduced to assure\u000d\u000a          doctor's competence);\u000d\u000a        recommendation 42 (the GMC should be more open and accountable).\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a      The recommendations in the CMO's report follow from the research\u000d\u000a        findings, in terms of what was\u000d\u000a        shown to be a general trend in the governance of medicine in other\u000d\u000a        countries towards greater\u000d\u000a        accountability and transparency. The CMO's recommendations were then put\u000d\u000a        forward in the White\u000d\u000a        Paper (Secretary of State for Health, 2007) that followed, and were\u000d\u000a        subsequently incorporated into\u000d\u000a        legislation. Reforms to the General Medical Council took place between\u000d\u000a        2008 and 2013, namely: a\u000d\u000a        smaller appointed Council; parity between lay and professional members;\u000d\u000a        the separation of the\u000d\u000a        investigatory and adjudicative functions; greater Parliamentary\u000d\u000a        accountability; and increased\u000d\u000a        scrutiny of competence with annual relicensing and periodic revalidation\u000d\u000a        of practising doctors. The\u000d\u000a        main reason for the impact made by this research was that it showed that\u000d\u000a        reforms to medical\u000d\u000a        regulation were taking place elsewhere. This challenged the GMC's view\u000d\u000a        of itself as a world leader\u000d\u000a        in medical regulation.\u000d\u000a      The research findings had an impact on the views of groups within the\u000d\u000a        profession, including\u000d\u000a        following dissemination through a series of presentations and question\u000d\u000a        and answer sessions: to the\u000d\u000a        CMO's Advisory Group in September 2005; to medical leaders at the Royal\u000d\u000a        College of Physicians\u000d\u000a        September 2005; to the full General Medical Council in October 2005.\u000d\u000a        These presentations were\u000d\u000a        part of the process of informing professionals of what was happening\u000d\u000a        elsewhere, and of reaching a\u000d\u000a        consensus on reform.\u000d\u000a      In addition, as part of the dissemination process, during 2008\/9 Allsop\u000d\u000a        gave presentations based\u000d\u000a        on the research at conferences in Canada, Portugal and France, and\u000d\u000a        published a number of\u000d\u000a        articles in peer-reviewed international journals with various academic\u000d\u000a        colleagues from other\u000d\u000a        countries.\u000d\u000a      From 2008 to 2013, Allsop's research continued to be useful to policy\u000d\u000a        makers and academics. For\u000d\u000a        example, she published a further article on complaints in 2009 that\u000d\u000a        reviewed the different models\u000d\u000a        for complaint handling. With permission, this was drawn on by a\u000d\u000a        regulator presenting a paper on\u000d\u000a        complaint handling to the International Association of Medical\u000d\u000a        Regulatory Authorities' bi-annual\u000d\u000a        conference in Ottawa (2012). Together with Professor Robert Dingwall, in\u000d\u000a        January 2011 Allsop\u000d\u000a        was asked to discuss current research findings on complaints and medical\u000d\u000a        negligence at an\u000d\u000a        informal meeting with the Parliamentary Health Select Committee, in\u000d\u000a        order to advise the\u000d\u000a        Committee whether or not to carry out a further inquiry at that time. In\u000d\u000a        2012, access to the initial\u000d\u000a        report was also widened, following a request to publish it by Lap\u000d\u000a        Lambert Publishing in Germany. It\u000d\u000a        is also available as an eBook on Amazon.\u000d\u000a      There has also been an impact on health regulators and the medical\u000d\u000a        profession in other countries.\u000d\u000a        The report has been cited in other publications on regulatory reform,\u000d\u000a        and Allsop has, for example,\u000d\u000a        given advice and support to a research project in British Colombia,\u000d\u000a        Canada, and presented a paper\u000d\u000a        based on the research to Italian doctors and academics who aim to\u000d\u000a        address institutional\u000d\u000a        governance arrangements in Italy to deal with incidents of poor practice\u000d\u000a        and harm to patients\u000d\u000a        (Alghero, Sardinia 2010).\u000d\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In 2005\/6, Allsop (and Jones) undertook research for the Chief Medical\u000d\u000a      Officer (CMO) on\u000d\u000a      comparative systems of medical governance to assess how doctors'\u000d\u000a      continuing competence was\u000d\u000a      assured. Their research drew on new data and built upon earlier research\u000d\u000a      by Allsop on complaints\u000d\u000a      and professional regulation. The study found that many countries had begun\u000d\u000a      to replace self-governance\u000d\u000a      by systems based on partnership with stakeholders to ensure\u000d\u000a      accountability, although\u000d\u000a      methods differed.

Some\u000d\u000a        used a\u000d\u000a        `learning model', based on continuing professional education and\u000d\u000a        colleague review; at the\u000d\u000a        other end of the spectrum, periodic appraisal was based on externally\u000d\u000a        validated, specialtyled\u000d\u000a        formal assessment using standardised measures. The administration of\u000d\u000a        tests was\u000d\u000a        through either computer-based `objective' instruments to assess\u000d\u000a        knowledge and practice\u000d\u000a        (as in the USA), or through face-to-face assessments by a visiting team\u000d\u000a        (as in the\u000d\u000a        Netherlands). In 2006, no country had a fully costed and functioning\u000d\u000a        system for regular\u000d\u000a        revalidation.\u000d\u000a    \u0009\u000d\u000a      Methods for identifying poor practice varied widely. They included\u000d\u000a        selective appraisal according to\u000d\u000a        particular risk factors (such as age), or investigating doctors where\u000d\u000a        practice statistics showed that\u000d\u000a        they deviated significantly from a norm. In most jurisdictions,\u000d\u000a        complaints to the governing body\u000d\u000a        could be investigated and lead to further action. For the most part,\u000d\u000a        such processes were not\u000d\u000a        transparent and public access was limited. The research identified the\u000d\u000a        New Zealand ombudsman\u000d\u000a        system as the most thorough in terms of investigation and learning, and\u000d\u000a        suggested that pro-active,\u000d\u000a        extensive informal co-operation between health regulators was a key\u000d\u000a        factor in identifying problems\u000d\u000a        early. The research showed that many countries had introduced a\u000d\u000a        separation between the function\u000d\u000a        of investigation of a complaint by the professional body, and that of\u000d\u000a        adjudication, by establishing an\u000d\u000a        external, lawyer-led tribunal.\u000d\u000a      "},{"CaseStudyId":"32383","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In 2011 Burton was awarded an OBE for services to occupational\u000a      healthcare. The award was\u000a      given in recognition of the significant contribution of the documented\u000a      research with respect to\u000a      promoting successful return to work for people living with back pain. The\u000a      Chief Medical Adviser\u000a      and Director for Health and Wellbeing at the Department of Work and\u000a      Pensions has stated that our\u000a      overall programme of research has \"fundamentally underpinned the\u000a        development of the health and\u000a        work agenda over the last 6 years\"1. Referring to a\u000a      crucial shift in public beliefs and growing\u000a      recognition of the need to involve all `key players', the editor of The\u000a      BackLetter which is published\u000a      in the USA summarised the impact of the research as follows2.\u000a    As editor of the BackLetter, my job for the past twenty years has been\u000a        to follow the evolution of\u000a        back pain research and the impact of the back pain and back pain-related\u000a        disability crisis on\u000a        societies around the world. The role of Kim Burton and the Spinal\u000a        Research Unit at the University\u000a        of Huddersfield in the evolution of modern thinking about low back pain\u000a        cannot be overestimated.\u000a        In my view, this unit is one of the three or four most influential back\u000a        pain and spinal research\u000a        groups on earth&#8212;key participants and innovators in the modern \"Back Pain\u000a        Revolution.\" In the\u000a        traditional medical approach to low back pain, back pain was interpreted\u000a        as a signal of disease or\u000a        injury, usually attributed to the physical stresses of work. The medical\u000a        prescription for these\u000a        injuries&#8212;rest and inactivity until the injury healed and pain abated&#8212;\u000a        proved to be disastrous,\u000a        removing millions of workers around the world from health-enhancing\u000a        employment to the sad fate\u000a        of permanent disability, at huge expense and productivity losses to\u000a        national economies. Burton and\u000a        colleagues at the University of Huddersfield&#8212;along with key\u000a        collaborators around the world&#8212; have\u000a        helped overthrow this traditional medical approach to back pain in favor\u000a        of a much more flexible\u000a        and practical biopsychosocial model. They have altered perceptions about\u000a        the nature and course\u000a        of back pain and its relationship with physical stresses and work. They\u000a        have identified the most\u000a        important obstacles to recovery and return-to-work, barriers which have\u000a        strong psychological and\u000a        social underpinnings. They have helped ordinary people, healthcare\u000a        providers, and society learn to\u000a        recognize these obstacles and move past them. They have re-energized the\u000a        concept of\u000a        rehabilitation. They transformed it from a second stage process that\u000a        occurs after healing is\u000a        complete into an activating intervention that occurs in the early days\u000a        after the onset of a potentially\u000a        disabling common health problem&#8212;when it is still possible to overcome\u000a        minor obstacles that might\u000a        otherwise morph into major barriers to recovery and return-to-work. In\u000a        their various studies,\u000a        articles, and contributions to reviews and guidelines they have\u000a        communicated their knowledge\u000a        effectively at multiple levels&#8212;in language everyone can understand. For\u000a        ordinary people and\u000a        employees around the world, The Back Book has become the world`s most\u000a        widely circulated\u000a        evidence-based educational aid on low back pain. And there are now\u000a        mirror editions of The Back\u000a        Book approach in multiple health areas. Burton and colleagues have\u000a        contributed to the ground-breaking\u000a        RCGP Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Acute Low Back Pain, the\u000a        Occupational\u000a        Health Guidelines for the Management of Low Back Pain at Work, the\u000a        European Guidelines on\u000a        Back Pain&#8212;including the seminal European Guidelines for Prevention in\u000a        Low Back Pain, which\u000a        Burton chaired. And they have not restricted their research and\u000a        practical solutions to the narrow\u000a        area of back pain. They have applied the knowledge from intensive back\u000a        pain research to many\u000a        other common health problems and the psychological, social and economic\u000a        obstacles they create.\u000a        While this is a group with strong scientific credentials they are very\u000a        definitely not ivory tower\u000a        scientists. They are a hands-on, roll-up-the sleeves group interested in\u000a        developing practical\u000a        solutions for ordinary people grappling with illness and disability in\u000a        the complexities of real world\u000a        settings.\u000a    The importance of this research, which has highlighted the need to tackle\u000a      biopsychosocial\u000a      obstacles to achieve timely recovery from back pain, has been recognised\u000a      by the BUPA\u000a      Foundation through their annual Health at Work Awards in 2005 and 2008.The\u000a      most prominent\u000a      example of the underpinning research being directly communicated to\u000a      individuals with back pain is\u000a      The Back Book, a leading educational resource which has sold over 3\u000a      million copies since it was\u000a      published in 19963. Originally developed from Burton's\u000a      pioneering studya of how a change in\u000a      beliefs could impact on sickness absence due to back pain, it has been\u000a      translated into more than\u000a      20 languages and continues to be used and requested by healthcare\u000a      services, workers\u000a      compensation systems and insurers in various countries. It is endorsed\u000a      by The Association of\u000a      British Spine Surgeons for acute back pain4. Their website\u000a      states that: \"The 2017Back Book' has been\u000a        shown in a randomized controlled trial to assist in giving the right\u000a        message at an early stage. Many\u000a        Health Centers and Hospitals will have it, if not, it can be obtained\u000a        from The Stationery Office by\u000a        post. Simply click on the picture of the book for a direct link if you\u000a        would like a copy\".\u000a    The key recommendation from our work, that remaining in work and\u000a      returning early to work are\u000a      generally beneficial for health, has become a pivotal message underlying\u000a      major policy initiatives. It\u000a      was drawn on by the UK National Director for Health and Work, Dame Carol\u000a      Black, in her 2008\u000a      report Working for a Healthier Tomorrow5. Citing\u000a      Waddell and Burtone, the report says, (page 21):\u000a      \"In particular, the recent review 2017Is Work Good for Your Health\u000a      and Well-Being?'e concluded that\u000a        work was generally good for both physical and mental health and\u000a        well-being ... Overall, the\u000a        beneficial effects of work were shown to outweigh the risks and to be\u000a        much greater than the\u000a        harmful effects of long-term worklessness or prolonged sickness absence.\u000a      This approach was\u000a      endorsed by the UK Government and this support was confirmed6\u000a      in a 2013 update by the\u000a      Department for Work &amp; Pensions and HM Treasury. It was endorsed in the\u000a      2009 NICE guidance\u000a      for reducing sickness absence and unemployment; and in the\u000a      Government-commissioned 2011\u000a      report Health at Work: An Independent Review of Sickness Absence7.\u000a      The wide influence of our\u000a      research on current health and work policy, and its implementation into\u000a      practice, has been\u000a      confirmed by the Chief Medical Adviser and Director for Health and\u000a      Wellbeing at the Department\u000a      for Work and Pensions: \"These reviews are widely quoted across the\u000a        public and private sectors,\u000a        the academic community, internationally and by Government Ministers\"1.\u000a    Because of our research expertise concerning the beliefs and attitudes of\u000a      the `key players', we\u000a      were commissioned to prepare guidance for GPs on the importance of work to\u000a      health, and on how\u000a      they should advise their patients to encourage work participation rather\u000a      than incapacity. This\u000a      guidance was sent to all UK GPs in 2010 to coincide with the introduction\u000a      of the FitNote8 which\u000a      replaced traditional incapacity certification; and was incorporated into\u000a      the related National\u000a      Education Programme for GPs, run by the Royal College of General\u000a      Practitioners in 2010-11.\u000a      Burton and colleagues have produced a range of widely-read leaflets\u000a      guiding professionals\u000a      associated with occupational rehabilitation. For example, their leaflet Work\u000a          &amp; Health: Changing\u000a          How We Think About Common Health Problems in Health Care in the\u000a          Workplace and in Society\u000a      \"challenges how you think about health at work, and offers ideas on\u000a        what you should and should\u000a        not do &#8212; based on new scientific evidence about what is good for workers\u000a        themselves\", drawing on\u000a      the underpinning original research and research syntheses outlined above.\u000a      Another leaflet,\u000a      Advising\u000a          Patients About Work: Evidence Based Approach For GPs offers\u000a      guidance to GPs about\u000a      helping patients to return to, or stay in, work. The underpinning research\u000a      demonstrated that they\u000a      can play a critical role in this respect.\u000a    The influence of our work promoting the beneficial effects of an early\u000a      return to work can also be\u000a      seen further afield. The Chief Medical Advisor to the Irish Department of\u000a      Social Protection has\u000a      credited our research with \"profoundly influencing the policy and\u000a        operational aspects pertinent to\u000a        early intervention measures resulting in the reduction of progression of\u000a        acute common health\u000a        problems to a state of chronic disability and dependence on long term\u000a        illness benefits and job loss.\u000a        All are beneficiaries, the patient\/worker (with better health outcomes),\u000a        the employer (with reduced\u000a        absenteeism and higher production) and the taxpayer (with reduced cost\u000a        of illness benefit)\".8 Our\u000a      research has influenced practice in workers' compensation systems in\u000a      Australia. The Chair of the\u000a      Australian Faculty of Occupational and Environmental Medicine Policy and\u000a      Advocacy Committee\u000a      stated that \"The body of work regarding management of back pain from\u000a        the University of\u000a        Huddersfield has led to change in the way doctors and health\u000a        practitioners are educated, both in\u000a        Victoria and across Australia. In 2011, the Australasian Faculty of\u000a        Occupational and Environmental\u000a        Medicine released a position statement 2017Realising the Health Benefits\u000a        of Work` which relied heavily\u000a        on the research of the University of Huddersfield and has led to better\u000a        management of people out\u000a        of the workforce due to health problems\"9.\u000a    This strand of the underpinning research concerned with the role of\u000a      significant others in\u000a      occupational rehabilitationg for people with back pain has\u000a      already generated local, national and\u000a      international media interest, including articles in the Huddersfield\u000a          Examiner (March 2011),\u000a      Osteopathy Today (November\u000a      2011), the American Pain Academy's e-newsletter\u000a      (June 2012) and\u000a      MDLinx Orthopedics News (February 2013). McCluskey has been\u000a      invited to present findings from\u000a      this strand of the research to pain management clinicians and occupational\u000a      health professionals\u000a      both nationally and internationally.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    McCluskey and Burton at the University of Huddersfield's Centre for\u000a      Health and Social Care\u000a      Research (CHSCR) have made significant contributions to bringing about a\u000a      cultural shift in how\u000a      back pain is viewed and treated.

It exemplifies\u000a      impact derived from formulating, implementing and evaluating complex\u000a      interventions aimed at\u000a      tackling difficult health and social care problems (see REF3a). The\u000a      underpinning research has\u000a      been supported by &#163;325,000 of research income earned in the period\u000a      1999-2011, with funding\u000a      received from, among others, the Health and Safety Executive, the\u000a      Department of Work and\u000a      Pensions, The Association of British Insurers, BackCare and Bupa.\u000a    Back pain is a leading cause of sickness absence in industrialised\u000a      nations, resulting in significant\u000a      healthcare costs and benefit payments. It has considerable negative\u000a      impacts on individuals,\u000a      employers and society as a whole, leading to reduced quality of life, lost\u000a      production, and poverty\u000a      arising from worklessness. Research led by Burton from the University of\u000a      Huddersfield, much of\u000a      which was located in its Spinal Research Unit, has demonstrated that these\u000a      negative outcomes\u000a      can be avoided for a large number of people experiencing back pain by\u000a      addressing psychosocial\u000a      factors acting as obstacles to work participation, such as pessimism about\u000a      recovery prospects.\u000a      These barriers to occupational rehabilitation derive from underlying\u000a      attitudes and beliefs shaped by\u000a      the social environment. Findings from an initial studya\u000a      undertaken in 1997-98 demonstrated that a\u000a      simple leaflet providing evidence-informed advice to workers with back\u000a      pain could create a positive\u000a      shift in beliefs and a concomitant reduction in sickness absence.\u000a    Building on these findings, in 1999 Burton and McCluskey conducted a\u000a      large, psychosocial\u000a      workforce survey, along with a controlled trial of an innovative\u000a      evidence-based psychosocial\u000a      intervention for workers with back pain. Findings identified the\u000a      psychosocial factors which were\u000a      particularly associated with sickness absence and demonstrated that an\u000a      early demedicalised\u000a      approach could reduce work loss. Importantly, it was shown that all the\u000a      key players need to work\u000a      together to encourage and support early return to work. The research thus\u000a      highlighted the benefits\u000a      of targeted, evidence-based information and adviceb, c, d.\u000a    Subsequent commissions were received from the Department for Work and\u000a      Pensions (&#163;55,000,\u000a      2005-2006) and the Association of British Insurers (&#163;52,000, 2007-2008) to\u000a      develop evidence-based\u000a      principles and practice for tackling work disability due to common health\u000a      problems, including\u000a      back pain. For the first time, it was shown that work has a positive\u000a      effect on health and wellbeing,\u000a      and that promoting work participation improves health outcomese,f.\u000a      These findings pointed to an\u000a      important role for GPs in addressing the potential of patients living with\u000a      back pain to sustain\u000a      employment.\u000a    From 2010, our research moved on to examining the wider psychosocial\u000a      obstacles to work\u000a      participation for those with persistent back pain, exploring the illness\u000a      perceptions of 'significant\u000a      others' such as spouses and partners, close family membersg.\u000a      Grant awards from BackCare and\u000a      the Bupa Foundation (&#163;40,000, 2010-2011) funded this research. Findings\u000a      from this extension to\u000a      our previous work have demonstrated how the negative beliefs of others can\u000a      reinforce pessimistic\u000a      attitudes about the potential for recovery of the person living with back\u000a      pain, and thereby validate\u000a      incapacity. The research also showed, conversely, ways in which positive\u000a      beliefs can facilitate\u000a      return to work and continued work participation. The findings add further\u000a      weight to our efforts to\u000a      reduce the adverse physical, mental and social effects associated with\u000a      worklessness and\u000a      unnecessary incapacity.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32384","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3578097","Name":"Montserrat"},{"GeoNamesId":"3374084","Name":"Barbados"},{"GeoNamesId":"3573591","Name":"Trinidad and Tobago"},{"GeoNamesId":"3580239","Name":"Grenada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3573511","Name":"Anguilla"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282028","Name":"Maldives"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3575830","Name":"Dominica"},{"GeoNamesId":"3378535","Name":"Guyana"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A letter from UNICEF1 described the Centre for Applied\u000a      Childhood Studies' research into child sex abuse in the Caribbean as a\u000a      `landmark', stating that \"UNICEF like the University [was] being\u000a        flooded with emails from organizations and individuals who want to use\u000a        the report for their work\". The study is one of only 40 worldwide,\u000a      and the only one in the Caribbean, to have been selected as meeting UN\u000a      standards for inclusion in a global review of quantitative research on\u000a      violence against children. Seven studies considered of particular global\u000a      significance, including ours, have been identified for in-depth\u000a      assessment. The research has been widely reported in the mainstream media,\u000a      significantly raising awareness.\u000a    Supported by an extensive public engagement process funded by the\u000a      Department for International Development, Jones' work was adopted by the\u000a      Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) and its constituent\u000a      national governments as the foundation for policy and legislative reform\u000a      across the region. All six governments that participated in the research\u000a      produced National Action Plans on Child Sexual Abuse and named the study\u000a      as the foundation for these policy documents. The documents were developed\u000a      from the CACS research. For example, the plan for Barbados2\u000a      opened with the statement that: \"This National Action Plan (NAP) for\u000a        addressing Child Sexual Abuse in Barbados was developed in response to\u000a        the findings of the Study on Child Sexual Abuse in the Eastern\u000a        Caribbean. This Study was conducted by UNICEF\/UNIFEM in collaboration\u000a        with the University of Huddersfield and Action for Children during the\u000a        period October 2008 to June 2009\". A key aim of these plans is the\u000a      widespread development of `culturally intelligent' child protection\u000a      systems. In Dominica, the cultural acceptance of child sexual abuse is\u000a      being challenged through what the National\u000a        Action Plan3 described as a \"sustained public\u000a        education and advocacy campaign ... to make it difficult for\u000a        perpetrators to be comfortable in public\". Research recommendations\u000a      on strengthening parenting have been translated into \"work with parents\u000a        from the pre-school level on the importance of child protection and the\u000a        harmful effects of sexual abuse and strengthen their parenting skills\".\u000a      In translating the research into practice, a partnership with the\u000a      government of Grenada and UNICEF has led to the development of IMPACT\u000a      (Interventions and Mitigations to Prevent the Abuse of Children &#8212; It's\u000a      Time), a strategic plan to create innovative, culturally relevant\u000a      interventions that can be rigorously evaluated in order to produce best\u000a      practice evidence for replication in other countries.\u000a    Between 2010 and 2012, in line with recommendations derived from the\u000a      research, the Grenada Government embarked upon \"the most intense period\u000a        of family law reform undertaken in the history of Grenada\". Having\u000a      implemented progressive child protection laws, Grenada is now lauded for\u000a      spearheading change in the region. Implementation of the IMPACT project\u000a      began in August 2013 with the introduction of a psychotherapeutic service\u000a      specifically designed to accommodate local sociocultural realities and\u000a      utilise indigenous strengths. The programme, a first in the Caribbean,\u000a      draws directly from the research and is being offered to girls who have\u000a      been sexually abused in collaboration with The\u000a        Sweet Water Foundation, an NGO specialising in the prevention of\u000a      sexual violence to women and girls in the Caribbean. Jones is leading\u000a      programme evaluation with a view to regional scale-up. In an assessment of\u000a      the impact of the CACS research, the Director of the Sweet Water\u000a      Foundation, stated4 that the study \"provided an\u000a        evidence-based framework for naming and understanding the complex\u000a        dimensions of the issue. Most importantly, it put the sexual abuse of\u000a        children ... front and centre of the Regional cultural debate; and from\u000a        there to those in Government, Non-Government, Practice, Policy, and the\u000a        Law. People now had, for the first time, the irrefutable information\u000a        they needed to tackle the prevention and treatment of child sexual abuse\u000a        in a systematic, methodical manner\". The Director also referred in\u000a      the same testimony to the influence of the research in changing attitudes.\u000a      Here she describes a group of men discussing the research: \"They opened\u000a        up in unprecedented and highly emotional manner. Some described their\u000a        full knowledge of historic sexual abuses against both female and male\u000a        children. They knew about it; some had participated in it or had let it\u000a        happen by virtue of their silence and their silencing of the child\u000a        victims and their families; and they were now ashamed and relieved to be\u000a        able to make confession and rid themselves of the burden of associated\u000a        guilt. They spoke in terms of what it meant to be a man, a father, a\u000a        protector of children. They spoke of taking more responsibility for the\u000a        upbringing of the young men in their villages, such that the young girls\u000a        could inhabit a more safe world\".\u000a    A wide range of research-users have drawn on our research. In Montserrat,\u000a      an Education Officer from the Early Childhood Department of the Ministry\u000a      of Education, stated5: \"More people are now aware of the\u000a        different forms of child sexual abuse and protections have been put in\u000a        place in early education settings; the research also played a role in\u000a        the formation of the Montserrat Children's Society and was taken up by\u000a        the Community Services Department to create new policy on safeguarding\u000a        children\". A lay church minister from Barbados reports6\u000a      that \"The research was instrumental in the establishment of our NGO\u000a        called 'Action for Justice'. This was birthed from the research as a\u000a        major focus is on child sexual abuse. It has become a labour of love and\u000a        through it we encourage persons to break the silence\". In Grenada,\u000a      following publication of the research, the Ministry of Social Development\u000a      commissioned a review of its Health and Family Life Curriculum for\u000a      Schools, substantively augmenting segments on sexual and reproductive\u000a      health, drawing on the findings of the underpinning research.\u000a    In terms of regional impact, the study was included in the working\u000a      document for the 23rd meeting of the Council for Human and\u000a      Social Development in Guyana 2012, and has informed 14 behaviour change\u000a      programmes across the Caribbean, including, for example: The `Changes\u000a      Programme', a psycho-educational group programme for female victims of\u000a      gendered violence; `Man to Man', another psycho-educational group\u000a      programme for male perpetrators of violence which focuses on cultural\u000a      assumptions around `ownership' of women and children, perceived\u000a      entitlements to sex and the upbringing of children in relation to these\u000a      assumptions; The Barbados Ministry of Health `Gender and Youth Sexual and\u000a      Reproductive Health and Rights' programme; and the Anguilla Safeguarding\u000a      Project.\u000a    Jones has instigated follow-up work based on widespread interest in\u000a      adoption of the research. For example, a week of training in culturally\u000a      relevant child protection practice, held in Grenada in March 2011, was\u000a      attended by 80 multi-disciplinary professionals. In Trinidad, between\u000a      April- November 2011, a collaborative initiative with the University of\u000a      the West Indies and Stop It Now! (USA) supported by an ESRC Knowledge\u000a      Exchange Grant awarded to Jones7 resulted in 45 professionals\u000a      attending advanced training on translating the research findings into\u000a      practice. The evaluation of this activity demonstrated an improvement in\u000a      awareness about the multi-faceted nature of child sexual abuse, and\u000a      greater recognition of the benefits arising from using the research to\u000a      inform professional practice. The research has also contributed to a new\u000a      regional strategy for child sexual abuse, The\u000a          Bridgetown Declaration and Agenda for Action to Prevent Child Sexual\u000a          Abuse in the Caribbean which was ratified by government\u000a      ministers from 18 countries in November 2012 at a UN conference at which\u000a      Jones presented her research in a keynote presentation. Linked to this\u000a      initiative, UNICEF has launched a public education campaign, `Break the\u000a      Silence' which aims to stimulate action against the sexual exploitation of\u000a      children at the community and family levels. The research report has been\u000a      listed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\u000a      (ECLAC) as a key document in assessing progress on Millennium Development\u000a      Goals, and has also informed the United Nation's first Human Development\u000a      Report on the Caribbean.\u000a    At the international level, the research report was promoted\u000a      in the 2010 `Strategic Thinking' section of the Communication Initiative\u000a      website, an international development network of 75,000 individuals and\u000a      organisations, generating requests from other countries for support in\u000a      child sexual abuse prevention. In 2010, for instance, the Deputy Minister\u000a      for Health and Family in the Maldives approached Jones to work with their\u000a      Government in tackling child sexual abuse8. The invitation\u000a      attested to the impact which the underpinning research has had in the\u000a      Caribbean. The Deputy Minister stated in the invitation that: \"We are\u000a        planning to have a National Child Protection Conference in the Maldives\u000a        in November this year. As the Maldives is an island nation with 200\u000a        islands being inhabited with very small populations we share similar\u000a        issues that you presented in your study of the Caribbean. We would like\u000a        you to present your findings here in the Maldives to make people aware\u000a        that we are not alone and there is a way to address it\". In\u000a      September 2010, Jones was invited to participate in the Fifth Milestones\u000a      Meeting of the World Health Organisation `Global Campaign for Violence\u000a      Prevention', South Africa, to contribute to `shaping the field of global\u000a      violence prevention'.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by the University of Huddersfield's Centre for Applied Childhood\u000a      Studies (CACS) carried out between 2008-2009 has played a major role in\u000a      tackling the problem of child sex abuse in the Caribbean.

It exemplifies impact derived from\u000a      communicating the multiple perspectives of stakeholders in ways which\u000a      support issue resolution by promoting better mutual stakeholder\u000a      understanding, and offering policymakers research-based analyses which\u000a      they use to drive policies (see REF3a).\u000a    Although a global problem, child sexual abuse is under-researched in poor\u000a      and middle-income nations. Policy in these countries often follows trends\u000a      set in the West where child protection systems tend to be narrow in remit,\u000a      focussing more on surveillance than on prevention; are costly to\u000a      administer; and can lack cultural relevance for other societies. As well\u000a      as leading to a wide range of psychopathologies, child sexual abuse\u000a      contributes to the region's status as having the second highest global\u000a      prevalence rates of HIV and teenage pregnancy and high levels of family\u000a      and community violence. Jones, at the University of Huddersfield's Centre\u000a      for Applied Childhood Studies, has taken a different and original approach\u000a      to investigating the issue. Moving away from an assumption of definitional\u000a      consensus, she instead examined how child sexual abuse is linked to social\u000a      constructions of childhood and to context-specific gendered and sexualised\u000a      behaviours. Jones was the key researcher for the underpinning\u000a        studya which examined the social and cultural dynamics of\u000a      child sexual abuse in six Caribbean countries: Anguilla, Barbados,\u000a      Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat and St Kitts &amp; Nevis. The research was\u000a      commissioned by UNICEF and partially funded by the Department for\u000a      International Development, with grants totalling &#163;275,000 paid to the\u000a      University of Huddersfield.\u000a    The research showed how child sexual abuse, an extensive problem in all\u000a      six countries, is not only about individual behaviours but is underpinned\u000a      by a complex interplay of sociocultural, structural and economic factors\u000a      which are at the same time historical, contemporary and intergenerational.\u000a      Three main types of child sexual abuse were documented: intra-familial\u000a      abuse, non-family abuse and transactional sexual abuse. New trends not\u000a      previously identified in the region were uncovered: child sex tourism,\u000a      cell-phone pornography and opportunistic abuse linked to natural\u000a      disasters. In addition to the abuse of girls, the abuse of boys was\u000a      reported as a growing concern, although homophobia and macho social norms\u000a      led to this trend being suppressed (a page 224). Despite the\u000a      gravity of the problems, legislation, policy and services were found to be\u000a      underdeveloped and ineffective overall. While good standards of individual\u000a      professional practice were observed, it was concluded that child sexual\u000a      abuse has become entrenched, in part as a result of widespread\u000a      institutional inaction and systemic failings. Government responses were\u000a      seen to be constrained by the fragility of economies characterised by\u000a      reliance on narrow economic bases, primarily tourism, and the servicing of\u000a      high levels of public debt.\u000a    Caribbean societies were revealed to be underpinned by a deeply-rooted\u000a      system of patriarchal beliefs, norms and structures likely to contribute\u000a      to child sexual abuse. For example, masculine and feminine identities are\u000a      often predicated on the reification of male sexual prowess and\u000a      entitlement, juxtaposed against female acquiescence and affirmation. The\u000a      research showed how unequal gender relations shaped sexual behaviour,\u000a      social attitudes and vulnerabilities. These social processes were\u000a      identified as both causes and consequences of sexual abuse. Reinforced\u000a      through cultural affirmation and patterns of socialisation linked to\u000a      conceptualisations of childhood, this environment has led to sexual\u000a      victimisation and the early sexualisation of children becoming widespread,\u000a      with sex-for-trade viewed as normal in some communities. The research\u000a      highlighted how children are made vulnerable to sexual victimisation\u000a      through a set of interacting factors which enable abuse behaviours to\u000a      thrive. The research showed that the culturally derived characterisation\u000a      of age was an important issue. For example, reaching puberty often\u000a      signified the end of childhood, and girls in this age group were\u000a      considered by some men as legitimate sexual targets. Poverty, although not\u000a      a direct causal factor for abuse, was found to increase the risk of\u000a      commercial sexual exploitationb.\u000a    The research has promoted a synergistic systems approach to child\u000a      protection which attends to the interconnected, multi-layered facets of\u000a      abuse in order to simultaneously generate attitude change, material\u000a      improvements to the lives of abuse victims and actions which address\u000a      structural inequalities. Crucially, the overall impact of interventions\u000a      derived from this multi-level approach is regarded as greater than the sum\u000a      of its individual parts, in relation to both preventing and responding to\u000a      abusec. A key recommendation arising from the research, the\u000a      findings of which have since been published in the first book about child\u000a      sexual abuse in the Caribbeand, concerns the need to shift\u000a      discussion from a preoccupation with individual psychopathology to one\u000a      that takes into account the social and cultural drivers of abusee,\u000a      and so leads to a greater awareness of the role communities and families\u000a      play in not only contributing to child abuse, but also in preventing it.\u000a      The research was selected by the international dissemination organisation,\u000a      the Alpha Galileo Foundation, as `featured\u000a        research'f. It has also provided the impetus for further\u000a      international research. For instance, CACS PhD students from Saudi Arabia,\u000a      Kenya, Barbados and Trinidad have investigated child sexual abuse in these\u000a      countries.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32385","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Conclusions drawn from studies into designing out burglary are detailed\u000a      in a series of UK national policy documents which contain recommendations\u000a      to build new homes to the SBD specification. Compliance with this standard\u000a      has resulted in 350,000 SBD homes being developed in the UK and,\u000a      consequently, a reduction in burglary rates of about 60% in homes designed\u000a      and built to this standard. Our ACC research is referenced throughout the\u000a      Home Office\/DCLG's Planning Guidance document Safer\u000a          Places: The Planning System and Crime Prevention1,\u000a      published in 2004 and guiding current practice. The nineteen references to\u000a      the work undertaken by the ACC are used as evidence of the crime risk of\u000a      individual or combined design features within residential housing, and\u000a      support the recommendations contained within the guidance. A senior member\u000a      of the Home Office Designing Out Crime Unit has indicated that Armitage's\u000a      work shaped this guidance, which was cited as good practice in two of the\u000a      UK government's subsequent Planning Policy Statements which local\u000a      authorities are required to follow when building new homes. The\u000a      testimonial2 clearly outlines the beneficial impact of the ACC\u000a      research: \"The work undertaken by Huddersfield was used to shape the\u000a        guidance set out in Safer Places &#8212; which in turn was then\u000a        referenced as a source of good practice in other documents. For example\u000a        Safer Places was referenced as a source of government policy aimed at\u000a        promoting better quality of place in the then Government's strategy on\u000a        World Class Places (2009); and was referenced in Home Office evidence to\u000a        the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee's evidence check on\u000a        lighting (also 2009). In 2010 both Safer Places and Secured By Design\u000a        (SBD) were referenced as sources of additional information on crime\u000a        prevention in the DCLG publication: Guidance on information requirements\u000a        and validation\". Both Safer Places and SBD were highlighted\u000a      in 2010 as crime prevention measures in DCLG's Guidance\u000a          on Information Requirements and Validation for Local Authority\u000a          Planning Departments. This document required local authorities\u000a      to take SBD into account when submitting Design and Access Statements. The\u000a      Home Office continues to act on Huddersfield's research into designing out\u000a      crime. In 2010\/11, they drew on ACC figures demonstrating lower burglary\u000a      rates in SBD developments2 as \"indicative data to use in\u000a        modelling when shaping thinking about home security\". This testimony\u000a      also emphasises the importance of the ongoing impact of the research: \"Last\u000a        (but most certainly not least &#8212; we continue to work with both Design\u000a        Council\/CABE and with DCLG on how best to promulgate and promote your\u000a        most recent research findings and case studies\".\u000a    The ACC research was presented as evidence by the Homes and Communities\u000a      Agency to support the recommendation that all Housing Association\u000a      properties should meet SBD standards. This evidence was first used in the\u000a      Housing Corporation's standards specification, which remained active until\u000a      April 2008. The research, similarly, informed the Design\u000a          and Quality Standards3 that superseded it. These\u000a      standards, again, contained a recommendation that homes should be built to\u000a      the SBD specification. The research was referenced in a currently active\u000a      English Partnerships guidance document. It cites Armitage's findings (page\u000a      10) as evidence of the need for regeneration projects to follow SBD\u000a      principles, and has been adopted as the building standard for developments\u000a      where the Agency has a land interest. It was also referenced in Home\u000a      Office evidence to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee on\u000a      street lighting safety2. A letter\u000a      published in The Times (23\/10\/13), written by Armitage and signed\u000a      by 69 national and international experts, has challenged current\u000a      Government proposals for relaxing SBD standards.\u000a    The ACC research demonstrating the effectiveness of SBD has been key to\u000a      ACPO's drive to advance SBD nationally as an evidence-based policy. In\u000a      2010, ACPO released a report\u000a      on using Design and Access Statements to reduce crime through SBD, citing\u000a      our 2009 research, with a comment on page nine about the importance of the\u000a      ACC work led by Armitage on Designing Out Crime). ACPO used Armitage's\u000a      research as the evidence base for its Parliamentary Memorandum submitted\u000a      to the Department for Communities and Local Government in 2008, which\u000a      argued successfully for SBD to remain within the Code\u000a          for Sustainable Homes. Subsequently, the Director and General\u000a      Manager at ACPO commented4 that it \"was rare not to make\u000a        some reference &#8212; main or in passing &#8212; to the work by Dr Armitage\" in\u000a      his many presentations, interviews and publications on designing out\u000a      crime. He also stated that \"The results of the work by Rachel Armitage\u000a        have been used in the practical application by crime prevention\u000a        practitioners, builders, security industry manufacturers and planning\u000a        officers for whom the day to day work denies the time to research the\u000a        subject deeply. We are linked to around 300 police practitioners\u000a        throughout the UK all of whom work from our material to promote CPTED\u000a        and SBD and all have copies of the SBD research\". This testimony\u000a      acknowledges the key role of the ACC of first bringing SBD into the policy\u000a      agenda and helping to drive forward eventual large-scale implementation: \"When\u000a        Rachel Armitage undertook her research into SBD in West Yorkshire this\u000a        was the first truly independent test of the SBD theory and practice. The\u000a        second piece of work with Leanne Monchuk took account of the technical\u000a        developments in the project and reinforced the benefits. Following each\u000a        piece of research Rachel was able to present the findings in a clear,\u000a        detailed way which identified the range of benefits and answered logical\u000a        questions about gentrification, displacement and crime switch. These\u000a        points were not obvious in the original project. She and Leanne have\u000a        presented to national police CPD training audiences and to regional and\u000a        commercial events. The work has been quoted in many other reports and\u000a        publications and has been taken as read in the rationale for\u000a        publications such as Safer Places &#8212; the planning system and crime\u000a        prevention.\" The Director of ACPO estimated, as mentioned in this\u000a      testimony, that at least 350,000 houses have been built to SBD standards\u000a      since 2007. The ACC research both provided the evidence which motivated\u000a      implementation of this approach and shaped the detailed specification of\u000a      its standards. Similarly, the National Policing Lead for Crime Prevention\u000a      provided a letter5 in August 2013 stating that staff \"working\u000a        in the field of Designing Out Crime constantly use your [ACC] work\u000a        to justify changes they make to developments, creating `safer' places\u000a        for our communities to live\". He considered this contribution to\u000a      housing and crime reduction policies to be particularly important in\u000a      difficult economic times: \"In times of recession, where governments and\u000a        organisations are constantly striving to cut costs, it is comforting to\u000a        know that evidence provided by you and your fellow academics makes a\u000a        compelling case to continue using effective security to make our\u000a        communities more socially sustainable\".\u000a    The ACC research into the link between housing quality and crime has been\u000a      used to revise the Building for Life housing award. The author of the\u000a      standard has stated6 that the re-write reflected their learning\u000a      from Armitage's research: \"In practice, the research was used by\u000a        Design Council [formerly CABE] to inform the revamp of Building\u000a        for Life. Building for Life is the most widely used design quality tool\u000a        for residential development in the planning system in England and has a\u000a        user base of local planning authorities, design consultants and house\u000a        builders\".\u000a    As well as shaping national and international policy (see below) on\u000a      designing out crime, the ACC research has had widespread impact on the\u000a      practices of local authorities and police forces. For example, Thames\u000a      Valley Police used Armitage's research to support its 2010 Compendium\u000a          of Crime Prevention and Reduction in The Planning System7.\u000a      Thames Valley Police have stated that Armitage's research was instrumental\u000a      in providing the evidence which led to them increasing the number of crime\u000a      prevention design advisors in the force from four to ten in 2008, and that\u000a      the Compendium remains at the forefront of the team's policies and\u000a      procedures, with police and local authority planning departments\u000a      frequently referring to these principles within their policy and practice.\u000a      Similar testimonies have been received from other areas of the UK. Leeds\u000a      City Council requires that all doors and windows meet the SBD standard, in\u000a      Designing for Community Safety: A Residential Design Guide which\u000a      remains their key policy document on planning for crime prevention. One of\u000a      the authors has written to Armitage acknowledging the importance of\u000a      Armitage's research in securing this policy requirement for housing in\u000a      Leeds. The West Yorkshire Police's Architectural Liaison Officer for Leeds\u000a      has stated that Armitage's research was quoted at \"almost every meeting\u000a        I attended both locally and nationally\". In addition, West Yorkshire\u000a      Police confirmed that ACC's research was instrumental in increasing the\u000a      number of Architectural Liaison Officers across the police force. Armitage\u000a      has continued to sustain strong engagement with policy- makers and\u000a      practitioners, by disseminating briefing notes commissioned by ACPO, the\u000a      Home Office and the Design Council, through media articles, and by means\u000a      of the publication of a position paper for the Independent Commission for\u000a      the Future of Policing (The Lord Stevens Commission) which has highlighted\u000a      the risk to crime prevention of moves towards deregulation within the\u000a      planning system. The ACC continue to contribute to the national debate on\u000a      architectural design during a period of austerity and deregulation. For\u000a      example, their work was cited in an article8\u000a      in The Guardian newspaper and in the online journal Inside\u000a          Housing. The Guardian article detailed some specific\u000a      beneficial impact of the ACC research as follows: \"Police and\u000a        architects sometimes have different ideas about how to design out\u000a        antisocial behaviour. Cul-de-sac has become a dirty word among\u000a        architects, who fear that antisocial behaviour happens where it cannot\u000a        be seen, while police insist &#8212; backed up by a 2010 report from the\u000a        University of Huddersfield &#8212; that cul-de-sacs are less prone to crime\u000a        because they offer fewer escape routes\".\u000a    The international importance of this research is evidenced by the role of\u000a      the ACC in developing Abu Dhabi's planning guidance to ensure that\u000a      properties are designed to consider crime prevention. In 2011, Armitage\u000a      was commissioned by the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council to develop planning\u000a        guidance9 specifications for crime prevention. The\u000a      manual, informed by her research, outlines the design principles required\u000a      for development within Abu Dhabi. The ACC received &#163;19,000 to fund this work,\u000a      completed in 2011, from Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council. The\u000a      international impact of ACC research into designing out crime is also\u000a      highlighted by citation of Armitage's work as evidence in the Parliament\u000a      of Victoria Inquiry into locally-based approaches to community safety and\u000a      crime prevention. Armitage and co-workers are cited 43 times in this report10.\u000a      The Executive Officer of the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee of the\u000a      Parliament of Victoria11 has testified that: \"One area of\u000a        academic research that was constantly drawn on in undertaking the\u000a        Inquiry and writing the Final Report was that of Dr Rachel Armitage at\u000a        the University of Huddersfield\".\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken by Armitage and Hirschfield and colleagues from the\u000a      Applied Criminology Centre (ACC) has made a significant contribution to\u000a      crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED).

In the 1990s, research led by Hirschfield, then at\u000a      the University of Liverpool, broke new ground by applying crime hotspot\u000a      mapping techniques to UK burglary data. Drawing on this work, he led a\u000a      consortium including the University of Huddersfield which was awarded\u000a      &#163;1,100,000a by the Home Office to evaluate their &#163;25,000,000\u000a      Reducing Burglary Initiative. Hirschfield moved to the University of\u000a      Huddersfield from Liverpool in 2004, bringing with him two research staff\u000a      and three grants. This consortium secured a further &#163;600,000b\u000a      to evaluate the crime strand of the New Deal for Communities. Since 2001,\u000a      Armitage has undertaken a decade-long programme of influential research\u000a      which culminated in the publication of her book on crime prevention\u000a      through housing design in 2013c. Research findings which have\u000a      impacted upon policy and practice, include evidence of the crime reduction\u000a      benefits of the SBD scheme, recommendations for improving the scheme, the\u000a      production of a crime risk assessment mechanism specific to residential\u000a      housing, and more recently, adapting these measures to allow for cultural\u000a      and climatic differences. Over &#163;200,000 for research on designing out\u000a      crime has been obtained since 2001 from diverse sources, including local\u000a      authorities, the Home Officed, ACPO and Abu Dhabi Urban\u000a      Planning Council. Armitage led several projects which assessed the impact\u000a      of residential design on crime and evaluated the effectiveness of ACPO's\u000a      SBD scheme. Designing out crime involves changes to the design and layout\u000a      of residential housing such as limiting\u000a        access, maximising natural surveillance and ensuring that car\u000a        parking is within the boundary of each property. Consideration for\u000a      what may appear to be, from a non-criminological perspective, minor design\u000a      changes, can reduce a property's vulnerability to crime. ACC researchc\u000a      showed that properties located on through roads were targets for 93% more\u000a      crime than those on a true cul-de-sac (without connecting footpaths).\u000a      Maximising natural surveillance also limited crime, with properties\u000a      overlooked at the rear experiencing 38% fewer crimes than those not\u000a      overlooked.\u000a    Assessments of the programmee conducted by Armitage have found\u000a      that homes built to the SBD standard were subject to 34% less crime and\u000a      about 60% less burglaries than those not built to this standard, and that\u000a      the additional costs are recouped by reduced crime in less than two years.\u000a      This original, rigorous and extensive study analysed police recorded crime\u000a      statistics, self-reported crime and feelings of safety for over 1000 homes\u000a      across West Yorkshire, controlling for factors such as age of property,\u000a      tenure and location. This research was the first to establish the benefits\u000a      of such a scheme. A subsequent evaluationf led by Armitage\u000a      confirmed these findings, showing that a non- SBD property is almost four\u000a      times more likely to experience a burglary than an SBD property. This\u000a      follow-on study established the robustness of the research, and\u000a      demonstrated that the identified crime reduction benefits had been\u000a      sustained over a ten year period. In 2007, Armitage was commissioned by\u000a      Greater Manchester Police to investigate the feasibility of embedding\u000a      designing- out-crime within local authority planning and policing\u000a      practices. In 2009, the Home Office and Department for Communities and\u000a      Local Government (DCLG) commissioned a further project to explore the\u000a      potential for designing out crime initiatives at national level in\u000a      relation to the possibility of establishing a National Crime Prevention\u000a      Service.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32386","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    More than 16 million people in the UK are thought to suffer from mental\u000d\u000a      health problems. In 2010 the estimated cost to individuals, employers and\u000d\u000a      the government has been estimated as more than &#163;100 billion per annum.\u000d\u000a      With only around 10 per cent of sufferers able to access psychological\u000d\u000a      treatments, the development of effective self-help approaches represents\u000d\u000a      an important means of supporting service users, offering them greater\u000d\u000a      choice, control and shared decision-making. Lucock's research has\u000d\u000a      underpinned increased support for the wider NHS workforce in providing\u000d\u000a      brief, accessible guided self-help interventions. The two clinical trials\u000d\u000a      mentioned above demonstrated the benefit to patients of this approach. The\u000d\u000a      controlled clinical trialc showed a positive effect on\u000d\u000a      patients' anxiety for a very brief, low-cost intervention (&#163;14 per person)\u000d\u000a      and this included evidence of significant goal attainment. The pragmatic\u000d\u000a      randomised controlled triald provided evidence of improvements\u000d\u000a      in levels of depression following a brief 3 session intervention. The\u000d\u000a      underpinning research led to the creation of SHARP, the Self-Help Access\u000d\u000a      in Routine Primary Care project1,2,3,4. Initially developed as\u000d\u000a      a pilot initiative in Wakefield, Yorkshire, with the support of the West\u000d\u000a      Yorkshire Workforce Development Confederation and Wakefield Primary Care\u000d\u000a      Trust, SHARP was designed to supply primary care practitioners with the\u000d\u000a      materials and training needed to provide brief, low-intensity, effective\u000d\u000a      self-help interventions for sufferers of mild to moderate anxiety and\/or\u000d\u000a      depression. Between 2008 and 2010, 44 NHS practitioners in the Wakefield\u000d\u000a      area received training in delivering guided self-help under the SHARP\u000d\u000a      programme. The initiative received positive feedback from practitioners,\u000d\u000a      with an evaluation of the pilot training programme reporting significant\u000d\u000a      increases in confidence in their ability to deal with anxiety and\u000d\u000a      depression and to use CBT in their practice5. For example, two\u000d\u000a      nurse practitioners and a GP from a Yorkshire GP practice attended the\u000d\u000a      SHARP training and used the approach in their mental health clinics. They\u000d\u000a      reported that the introduction of mental health clinics based on the SHARP\u000d\u000a      approach contributed to a reduction in the prescription for\u000d\u000a      anti-depressants. The General Practitioner stated that \"We have been\u000d\u000a        running the mental health clinic for at least 4 years now. One of the\u000d\u000a        big differences is the reduction in the number of patients suffering\u000d\u000a        from stress related problems \/ anxiety \/ depression in routine GP\u000d\u000a        clinics. We have also noticed a marked reduction in antidepressant\u000d\u000a        prescribing\"6. As a result of the pilot and expansion in\u000d\u000a      the Wakefield District, the SHARP initiative was included in the\u000d\u000a      specification for the roll out and development of IAPT services in\u000d\u000a      Wakefield and adopted as one of the step 2 interventions in the stepped\u000d\u000a      care service model7.\u000d\u000a    In 2009, with backing from Yorkshire and the Humber NHS, the scheme was\u000d\u000a      extended across the Yorkshire and Humber region, where a further 50 NHS\u000d\u000a      practitioners took part in a two-year `train the trainers' programme2,3,4.\u000d\u000a      This phase, completed in September 2011, was resourced in response to the\u000d\u000a      positive feedback received from the pilot5, described above,\u000d\u000a      and allowed the widespread training of SHARP practitioners in a number of\u000d\u000a      localities. A project report produced in November 2011 showed that the\u000d\u000a      SHARP approach had been taught to a wide range of regional practitioners\u000d\u000a      including: 24 clinicians in midwifery and health visiting teams in\u000d\u000a      Wakefield; Improving Access to Psychological Therapies teams in Barnsley,\u000d\u000a      Bradford, Grimsby, Halifax, Sheffield and Wakefield; GPs in Sheffield;\u000d\u000a      health visitors and health trainers in Kirklees; and a drugs support team\u000d\u000a      in Leeds3. In keeping with the findings and recommendations of\u000d\u000a      Lucock's studies, the training programme encouraged practitioners to\u000d\u000a      understand and support service-users' own self-help strategies and to\u000d\u000a      integrate facilitation of self-help into their routine work. The training\u000d\u000a      programme confirmed our research finding that effective self-help support\u000d\u000a      could be provided by a range of health professionals after only brief\u000d\u000a      training (between one and two days).\u000d\u000a    The SHARP website1 was launched in 2009, and from 2011 has\u000d\u000a      allowed access to more than 40 self-help leaflets, most in both `full' and\u000d\u000a      more readable `lite' formats. These leaflets offer information on\u000d\u000a      self-help for anxiety, depression and stress. They cover both\u000d\u000a      understanding and managing problems. In keeping with the underpinning\u000d\u000a      research findings, these leaflets were designed, with input from a health\u000d\u000a      literacy advisor, to be brief and readable. An audit using Google\u000d\u000a      analytics in July 2013 showed that the website is being accessed over 600\u000d\u000a      times by up to 400 separate users each week with 95% accessed during\u000d\u000a      weekdays. Access was worldwide, not just from the UK. UK users were\u000d\u000a      located across the country, including the London region, Manchester and\u000d\u000a      Glasgow, indicating widespread usage beyond the original area of\u000d\u000a      dissemination. Local NHS practitioners can register on the website to\u000d\u000a      access training resources, with 226 registering during the training\u000d\u000a      period.\u000d\u000a    Feedback from services provides evidence of the value of SHARP in a\u000d\u000a      number of ways. These include educating patients about their symptoms of\u000d\u000a      anxiety and depression and preparing them for a referral to the IAPT\u000d\u000a      service; supporting a shared dialogue between the GPs and the IAPT workers\u000d\u000a      about who is likely to benefit from talking treatments for anxiety and\u000d\u000a      depression; the benefits to patients of using the leaflets to normalise\u000d\u000a      and explain their problems. An IAPT service manager stated that \"The\u000d\u000a        GPs now use SHARP leaflets to educate the patients about their reported\u000d\u000a        symptoms, and introduce the idea that the patient can help themselves.\u000d\u000a        The leaflets help the GPs to assess if the patient is willing or able to\u000d\u000a        consider learning more about their problem. This helps them to prepare\u000d\u000a        patients they think could benefit from IAPT\"8 .\u000d\u000a    Lucock's research has also contributed to NHS guidance. His contribution\u000d\u000a      to the Good Practice Guide on the Contribution of Applied\u000d\u000a        Psychologists to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies 9included\u000d\u000a      a description of the guided self-help intervention provided by the GMHWs\u000d\u000a      described earlierd. He also contributed to the Good\u000d\u000a        Practice Guidance on the Use of Self-help Materials within IAPT Services10,\u000d\u000a      which was written in response to feedback from services and those\u000d\u000a      attending IAPT training courses who expressing a need for expert guidance\u000d\u000a      on the use of self-help materials, given the wide range of different\u000d\u000a      materials available. This guidance is therefore widely used to support the\u000d\u000a      training and practice of those working within IAPT services in the UK.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Recent NHS policy has prioritised improving access to cost-effective\u000d\u000a      psychological interventions for people with mental health problems.\u000d\u000a      Research by Lucock at the Centre for Health and Social Care Research\u000d\u000a      (CHSCR) has contributed to meeting this challenge by developing and\u000d\u000a      evaluating self-help interventions which can be provided by a range of NHS\u000d\u000a      staff without professional psychotherapy or mental health training.

It exemplifies impact derived from informing the development of\u000d\u000a      complex interventions aimed at tackling difficult social, welfare and\u000d\u000a      health problems (see REF3a).\u000d\u000a    Improving access to psychological therapies has been an NHS priority for\u000d\u000a      a number of years. It is underpinned by the national and international\u000d\u000a      health policy imperative of significantly reducing the consumption of\u000d\u000a      psychoactive drugs by mental health service-users through a major but\u000d\u000a      affordable expansion in the provision of psychological therapies. The\u000d\u000a      National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has\u000d\u000a      recommended the use of self-help approaches as a low-intensity stage in a\u000d\u000a      stepped-care service model. This service model includes provision of\u000d\u000a      self-help information and interventions as an early step in a person's\u000d\u000a      treatment pathway. Our research involves a programme of related studies\u000d\u000a      into the development of effective and accessible self-help interventions,\u000d\u000a      identifying which practitioners can and should support the interventions\u000d\u000a      and how they can be delivered most cost-effectively. This research\u000d\u000a      programme was developed in response to NICE's endorsement of self-help\u000d\u000a      interventions based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for anxiety and\u000d\u000a      depression, and NHS policy guidance to increase the capacity of primary\u000d\u000a      care services to support people with mental health problems.\u000d\u000a    Studies led by Lucock since 2002 have made a major contribution to the\u000d\u000a      implementation of self- help interventions for people with mental health\u000d\u000a      problems. Underpinning this research is a major paradigm shift towards\u000d\u000a      viewing mental health issues from a psychosocial rather than a medical\u000d\u000a      perspective. The research addresses the implications for practice of this\u000d\u000a      shift by investigating ways in which psychosocial interventions can be\u000d\u000a      provided on a larger scale, partly to increase choice for the service-user\u000d\u000a      but also as an alternative to drug and other medical treatments which are\u000d\u000a      more appropriate for those with more serious mental health problems. The\u000d\u000a      research has provided evidence for the feasibility of NHS practitioners in\u000d\u000a      different roles to deliver effective interventions designed to support\u000d\u000a      mental health service-users to help themselves more effectively and to\u000d\u000a      manage their difficulties. The research has investigated self-help\u000d\u000a      strategies used by people with mental health problems in their everyday\u000d\u000a      lives and service-user views about what makes interventions designed to\u000d\u000a      support self-help effective. This has led directly to practice\u000d\u000a      developments which include interventions supporting self-help that can be\u000d\u000a      accessed via routine NHS services, provided by a broad range of health\u000d\u000a      professionals, and self-help materials available to the wider public.\u000d\u000a    Given the time-demands, and therefore economic cost, of delivering\u000d\u000a      psychosocial support for effective self-help, research demonstrating its\u000d\u000a      benefits can only generate beneficial impact if a large and affordable\u000d\u000a      workforce with the appropriate capabilities can be trained. A 2003 study\u000d\u000a      used case studies to evaluate the role of graduate primary care mental\u000d\u000a      health workers (GMHWs), a then new addition to the NHS workforce, in\u000d\u000a      providing CBT based guided self-help interventions for anxiety and\u000d\u000a      depressiona. It was concluded that GMHWs can be trained to\u000d\u000a      provide such interventions effectively. A pilot evaluation of guided\u000d\u000a      self-help provided by primary care nurse practitioners was carried out in\u000d\u000a      2004-5b. The findings showed that primary care nurses could\u000d\u000a      provide brief and effective self-help interventions. It was recommended\u000d\u000a      that primary care nurses should have access to self-help materials in the\u000d\u000a      course of their routine work so that they could offer them to\u000d\u000a      service-users as and when needed. This was a key study underpinning the\u000d\u000a      SHARP initiative described later. Two pragmatic clinical trials were\u000d\u000a      carried out in routine NHS services to evaluate the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      relatively inexpensive health care practitioners supporting service-\u000d\u000a      users' self-help activities. One, in 2004-5, was a controlled clinical\u000d\u000a      trial of a brief self-help intervention for patients with anxiety problems\u000d\u000a      waiting for psychological therapy and provided by an assistant\u000d\u000a      psychologistc. The intervention was based on a CBT anxiety\u000d\u000a      self-help programme developed by the research team. The second trial, in\u000d\u000a      2008-9, was a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of brief,\u000d\u000a      three-session CBT based guided self-help intervention provided by graduate\u000d\u000a      primary care mental health workers within a primary care mental health\u000d\u000a      serviced. Both studies demonstrated that practitioners with\u000d\u000a      less experience and training than psychotherapists or clinical\u000d\u000a      psychologists can provide effective low-intensity guided self-help\u000d\u000a      interventions in routine NHS services.\u000d\u000a    Other studies have sought the views of service-users. A study in 2004\u000d\u000a      used a consultation event to capture service users' views of the self-help\u000d\u000a      strategies they use on a day to day basis that help them to manage their\u000d\u000a      problemse. A key finding concerned the importance of\u000d\u000a      incorporating and building on self-help strategies which service-users\u000d\u000a      found effective into self-help support. A further study in 2005\u000d\u000a      investigated service-users' views about self-help materials and their\u000d\u000a      effectiveness in different service settings, including self-help groupsf.\u000d\u000a      Drawing on semi-structured interviews and qualitative template analysis,\u000d\u000a      the research focused on the effectiveness of a self-help programme for\u000d\u000a      anxiety that was developed by the research team. Although the\u000d\u000a      service-users were positive about the programme, they expressed a clear\u000d\u000a      view that the material was too complex and insufficiently accessible for\u000d\u000a      individuals to benefit from without a lot of guidance, particularly if\u000d\u000a      they were depressed. The research recommended that self-help materials\u000d\u000a      should be less complex, and that professionals should be trained to\u000d\u000a      support service-users in making use of them. In 2007-9 Lucock also worked\u000d\u000a      on NIHR Service Delivery and Organisation (SDO) funded research into the\u000d\u000a      barriers and facilitators of effective self-care support in mental health\u000d\u000a      services. This mixed-methods study, led by Dr Steve Gillard from St\u000d\u000a      George's, University of London, illustrated how effective self- care\u000d\u000a      support should be tailored by practitioners flexibly and over time,\u000d\u000a      depending on the changing needs of people with mental health problemsg.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32387","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has significantly enhanced understanding of LGBT equalities\u000d\u000a      issues1. Crucially, it has challenged two common assumptions:\u000d\u000a      firstly, that LGBT people have won all their rights; and secondly, that\u000d\u000a      bisexual people do not have issues with which policymakers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners should be concerned. As a result, Monro's work has had\u000d\u000a      considerable influence in a number of key areas, both nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally, in the LGBT equalities field, particularly in terms of\u000d\u000a      her distinctive contribution concerning bisexuality. Monro provided in\u000d\u000a      excess of 12 presentations, many of them invited, to conferences and other\u000d\u000a      events (for example, networks, international workshops and Pride\u000d\u000a      celebrations) organised primarily for community members, policymakers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners over the 2008-2013 period. For example, in Barcelona in\u000d\u000a      October 2009 Monro gave a keynote address at Against Homophobia,\u000d\u000a      an EU conference whose delegates included representatives of the European\u000d\u000a      Commission and international human rights organisations.\u000d\u000a    This work had a direct influence on policy development and implementation\u000d\u000a      across Europe, including the use of Monro's findings in a White\u000a        Paper2. In 2010 and 2011 the methodologies used for the\u000d\u000a      Organisational Change, Resistance and Democracy projecta were\u000d\u000a      adapted for a major\u000apolicy\u000a        survey of public officials and LGBT human rights in 18 countries by\u000d\u000a      the Equality and Citizens' Rights Department of the EU Agency for\u000d\u000a      Fundamental Rights. Monro's findings were also used in policy discussions\u000d\u000a      in several EU member states, including Italy, where a report3\u000d\u000a      cited Monro and Richardson (2010) as describing a shift in the management\u000d\u000a      of LGBT equalities from a politicised to an administrative approach. The\u000d\u000a      report recommends that: `local authorities need to make a fundamental\u000d\u000a        transition from the political arena to the technical\/ administrative\u000d\u000a        one' 3 (page 41).\u000d\u000a    Monro was invited to provide a seminar\u000d\u000a      and a workshop at the Human Sciences Research Council in Pretoria in\u000d\u000a      February 2013. The workshop, which compared LGBT human rights concerns in\u000d\u000a      South Africa and the UK, attracted policymakers and activists. Feedback\u000d\u000a      included statements such as, `It will make me think about the value of\u000d\u000a        multiple identities'4.\u000d\u000a    In the UK, the Organisational Change project was substantially drawn on\u000d\u000a      in The\u000a          Bisexuality Report, which was published by the Open University\u000d\u000a      in February 20125. The report has since been downloaded more\u000d\u000a      than 20,000 times and disseminated to all central government departments.\u000d\u000a      Monro's contribution has subsequently been recognised by requests to\u000d\u000a      assist government departments. In September 2012, following contacts made\u000d\u000a      through the bisexuality research project (see above), she was invited to\u000d\u000a      deliver a training workshop to the Executive at the Department of Work and\u000d\u000a      Pensions (DWP) who manage more than 100,000 staff. Individuals\u000d\u000a      subsequently commented on the impact of this workshop. For example, one\u000d\u000a      individual stated that `I think it might have already changed some\u000d\u000a        people's lives for the better. I for one feel loads better that\u000d\u000a        consciousness of those around me has been raised' (Manager,\u000d\u000a      post-training feedback filed at University of Huddersfield). The workshop\u000d\u000a      subsequently fuelled, in 2013, the development of nationwide DWP training\u000d\u000a      which focused on equality issues for bisexual DWP employees and customers.\u000d\u000a      Activities included Civil Service LGBT Awareness Learning,\u000d\u000a      bisexual-specific guidance in management training, and bisexuality\u000d\u000a      awareness sections in the Department of Work and Pensions LGBT History\u000d\u000a      Month and International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia,\u000d\u000a      all documented on the DWP intranet. These interventions were directly\u000d\u000a      informed by Monro's training. For instance, the national DWP HR Sexual\u000d\u000a      Orientation Lead stated that `following Surya's bisexuality training\u000d\u000a        last year, I developed a new \"Busting some myths about bisexuality page\"\u000d\u000a        on the sexual orientation section of our Diversity and Equality intranet\u000d\u000a        site' (the intranet is available to DWP employees)6. In\u000d\u000a      October 2012 Monro also contributed to a Department of Health meeting\u000d\u000a      about public health, with the Policy Adviser to the Department's Equality\u000d\u000a      and Inclusion Team later reporting7 that she had taken note\u000d\u000a      that Monro had `stressed that Public Health England will need to\u000d\u000a        provide some guidance\/expertise at a national level... [to] address\u000a        the health needs of LGBT people as minority communities'.\u000d\u000a    The findings of the Organisational Change project have also influenced\u000d\u000a      policies at regional and local levels. For example, the documentation for\u000d\u000a      the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation\u000a        Trust's Equality Delivery System, in November 2011, called for `people\u000a        in senior management positions ... to give a clear message about the\u000d\u000a        importance of the sexualities and trans equalities agenda in relation to\u000d\u000a        employment opportunities and all areas of service provision'8.\u000d\u000a      Monro was invited to give the keynote speech at the 2009 LGBT Health\u000d\u000a      Summit, held in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and attended by 250 delegates\u000d\u000a      including policymakers, practitioners and members of the local community,\u000d\u000a      that helped lay the foundations for the research impacting on professional\u000d\u000a      training and practice. More than 80 per cent of participants who took part\u000d\u000a      in a post- conference evaluation (on file at the University of Newcastle)\u000d\u000a      said that the research findings would affect their work. For instance, a\u000d\u000a      housing manager stated that he would consider the needs of LGBT people\u000d\u000a      more inclusively; a NHS representative said that he would make the LGBT\u000d\u000a      population visible in policy and action plans; a local authority\u000d\u000a      representative considered that the research would contribute to the\u000d\u000a      establishment of an equality scheme for LGBT people in his organisation;\u000d\u000a      and a union representative vowed to raise LGBT issues with his county\u000d\u000a      council and employer. The research findings have since been drawn upon in\u000d\u000a      practice guidelines, including the Social\u000a        Care Institute for Excellence's 2011 At A Glance report9,\u000d\u000a      which cited the findings in its recommendations for developing training\u000d\u000a      programmes.\u000d\u000a    LGBT Equalities: Surviving Austerity, a workshop held in November 2012\u000d\u000a      for community members, policymakers and practitioners as part of an ESRC\u000d\u000a      Festival of Social Sciences, also developed impact, as demonstrated in the\u000d\u000a      workshop evaluation. For example, a manager in the third sector wrote: `I\u000d\u000a        am producing an LGBT strategy for my workplace, so [this] information\u000a        ... will feed into it'; An Equality Policy Officer stated that `The\u000a        findings ... will be incorporated into work done within the Welsh Local\u000d\u000a        Government Association on providing equality across the public sector';\u000a      and a member of the community and voluntary sector said: `I will be\u000d\u000a        more mindful of the wider LGBT community\/sector outside of my\u000d\u000a        organisation's specific focus' (evaluation results on file at the\u000d\u000a      University of Huddersfield).\u000d\u000a    The research has generated wider public appreciation of LGBT issues\u000d\u000a      through media exposure which have included: widespread coverage in the\u000d\u000a      LGBT press and Monro's appearance on Radio 4's Woman's Hour (April\u000d\u000a      2012). It has also directly stimulated LGBT diversity awareness work with\u000d\u000a      approximately 130 11-to-18-year-olds at two Youth Citizenship conferences\u000d\u000a      funded by the ESRC (November 2012 and November 2013) which resulted in\u000d\u000a      vulnerable young LGBT people accessing support10\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken by Monro from the Centre for Research in the Social\u000d\u000a      Sciences (CRISS) into the continuing marginalisation of lesbian, gay,\u000d\u000a      bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people has influenced UK and international\u000d\u000a      policymaking and practice.

This research programme has been\u000d\u000a      achieved through a series of research projects and outputs.\u000d\u000a    One project, Organisational\u000d\u000a        Change, Resistance and Democracy: LGBT Equalities Initiatives in Local\u000d\u000a        Government, was undertaken between 2007-2010 by Monro (Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow, University of Huddersfield, co-investigator) with Richardson\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Sociology and Social Policy, principal investigator) at the\u000d\u000a      University of Newcastle, with an ESRC grant of &#163;230,000a.\u000d\u000a      Monro's distinctive contributions include: the study was initiated by\u000d\u000a      Monro following her research at Keele University (2001-2002) and her\u000d\u000a      doctoral research on transgender diversity (University of Sheffield,\u000d\u000a      2000); Monro led on developing intersectional approaches and applying\u000d\u000a      these via a range of community and policy-oriented interventions; Monro\u000d\u000a      overtly included bisexual communities in local government sexualities\u000d\u000a      equalities studies for the first time (following its omission in the Keele\u000d\u000a      study), and this subsequently led to a research programme on bisexuality.\u000d\u000a    The Organisational Change project, conducted in Southern and Northern\u000d\u000a      England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, utilised action learning sets which\u000d\u000a      met four times in each region, generating a total of 16 meetings, with\u000d\u000a      members representing different local authorities, community organisations\u000d\u000a      and partner agencies from across the regions. The project also tracked the\u000d\u000a      development and implementation of sexualities equality policies in four\u000d\u000a      local authorities that were purposively sampled to represent different\u000d\u000a      types, levels of performance, political colours, activity concerning\u000d\u000a      equalities, and levels of deprivation. A total of 37 semi-structured\u000d\u000a      interviews were conducted with strategic level and frontline local\u000d\u000a      authority workers, focusing on two different service areas for each\u000d\u000a      authority, and their partners in statutory sector and voluntary\/community\u000d\u000a      sector agencies. Further strands of the methodology consisted of 15\u000d\u000a      interviews with key national stakeholders across the three countries and\u000d\u000a      five interviews with local authority representatives. The study was rated\u000a        `good' by the ESRC subsequent to completion. It provided original\u000d\u000a      insights in three respects: in illuminating the operation of resistance to\u000d\u000a      the LGBT equalities agenda in the organisational practices of local\u000d\u000a      authorities and partner agencies in areas such as social care, youth work\u000d\u000a      and leisure servicesb; in developing intersectional approaches\u000d\u000a      to sexualities equalities workc; and in providing policy\u000d\u000a      analysis of LGBT equalities work in the 2007-2010 periodd. Key\u000d\u000a      findings documented in the referenced outputs concerned the\u000d\u000a      marginalisation of bisexual people in policymaking and practice; and the\u000d\u000a      high levels of misunderstanding and stigmatisation that this group faces\u000d\u000a      from both lesbian\/gay and heterosexual populations. The findings were\u000d\u000a      drawn on in a booke published by Palgrave-Macmillan.\u000d\u000a    Community and media interest in this conclusion prompted Monro to develop\u000d\u000a      further cross-cultural work concerning bisexuality. This was done\u000d\u000a      initially through engagement with the UK bisexual communityf.\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, in 2012-2013, Monro undertook a follow-on research project\u000d\u000a      concerning bisexuality with the assistance of a Columbian researcher.\u000d\u000a      Interviews were conducted in the UK and Columbia with bisexual and other\u000d\u000a      non-heterosexual people, selected to represent individuals of diverse\u000d\u000a      ages, ethnicities, class backgrounds, abilities and genders. Relevant\u000d\u000a      blogs and websites were also analysed. The findings showed that\u000d\u000a      individuals who do not fit into heterosexual, gay or lesbian categories\u000d\u000a      face particular challenges concerning identity construction, social\u000d\u000a      marginalisation, community-building and political activism.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32835","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","UK Space Agency"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Tseloni's research has informed national and international\u000d\u000a      crime prevention agencies in in terms of both their understanding of the\u000d\u000a      nature and causes of the crime drop and victimisation inequalities, and\u000d\u000a      how they have approached tackling these issues. For example, in relation\u000d\u000a        to the measurement of crime and the acquisition and dissemination of\u000d\u000a        crime statistics she has advised social researchers responsible for\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey on questionnaire design, hard to\u000d\u000a      reach populations and the use of sampling (Scottish Government Social\u000d\u000a      Research on the 2008-09 Scottish Crime and Justice Survey questionnaire\u000d\u000a      (2007-2010).

In her capacity as Chair (2013\u000d\u000a      to date; Vice-Chair: 2010-2013) of the Crime and Justice Statistics\u000d\u000a      Network she has worked on various consultations with regards to official\u000d\u000a      crime data, including the consultation that paved the way for the transfer\u000d\u000a      of the British Crime Survey from the Home Office to the ONS (UK Statistics\u000d\u000a      Authority, Re `Cross-national comparison of UK crime statistics', Overcoming\u000d\u000a        barriers to trust in crime statistics: England and Wales, UKSA\u000d\u000a      Monitoring Report 5: 63).\u000d\u000a    Her research has also informed internal practices within police\u000d\u000a        forces. For example, her work with Humberside police reassured the\u000d\u000a      force that their crime rates were not higher and in cases lower than for\u000d\u000a      the rest of England and Wales, and the public had similar levels of\u000d\u000a      satisfaction with Humberside police and similar reporting rates as the\u000d\u000a      rest of England and Wales. This enabled the force to identify that the\u000d\u000a      relatively higher level of crime in their locality was in part down to the\u000d\u000a      quality of their crime recording systems (1997). Professor Tseloni's work\u000d\u000a      provided a different form of reassurance to the Metropolitan Police Force\u000d\u000a      in relation to the policing of ethnic minor minority communities. Her\u000d\u000a      research concluded that external disproportionality was actually by ethnic\u000d\u000a      minority citizens with complaints against ethnic minority officers (but\u000d\u000a      not necessarily the same group) in areas with high ethnic minority\u000d\u000a      populations. Furthermore problems with internal practices were identified\u000d\u000a      in relation to dealing with ethnic minority police officers and staff\u000d\u000a      problems formally while there was a tendency to do so informally for White\u000d\u000a      officers (2006).\u000d\u000a    In terms of informing crime reduction strategies and addressing the\u000d\u000a        problem of victimisation inequalities, Professor Tseloni has since\u000d\u000a      2012 been a Board Member on the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership. In\u000d\u000a      this capacity she has advised on crime rates and patterns in\u000d\u000a      Nottinghamshire, and informed local crime reduction initiatives concerning\u000d\u000a      `problem families'; and tackling the link between crime and alcohol\u000d\u000a      through the sensible alcohol consumption project in Nottingham. Her work\u000d\u000a      with the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership has also resulted in the\u000d\u000a      development of student profiles that have informed the introduction of\u000d\u000a      adverts promoting crime awareness in student areas of the city, and\u000d\u000a      landlord accreditation schemes in relation to aspects of burglary security\u000d\u000a      within their properties. As a current member of Nottingham Crime and Drugs\u000d\u000a      Partnership Burglary Task and Finish Group member her research has\u000d\u000a      informed the prioritising of vulnerable population groups and\u000d\u000a      interventions in relation to the effectiveness of security measures and\u000d\u000a      the reduction of burglary. This latter research impact has also informed\u000d\u000a      national advice and guidance on incorporating crime safety in housing and\u000d\u000a      urban design through the funding and dissemination of research findings by\u000d\u000a      the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (2009-2010).\u000d\u000a    As well as influencing approaches to the measurement of crime and\u000d\u000a      tackling victimisation inequalities within the United Kingdom, Professor\u000d\u000a      Tseloni's research has achieved an international reach in terms of\u000d\u000a      informing the activities of crime reduction agencies.

The\u000d\u000a      problem with this approach is that it cannot guarantee that the\u000d\u000a      associations between victimisation and any risk factor is not spurious,\u000d\u000a      i.e. brought about by other uncontrolled for mediating causes. Statistical\u000d\u000a      models including all possible related factors are required to gauge the\u000d\u000a      true causes of victimisation. In addition, the frequency of crimes\u000d\u000a      suffered had been ignored prior to the Quantitative Criminology Group\u000d\u000a      work. Indeed focussing on the dichotomy between victims and non-victims\u000d\u000a      overlooks repeat victimisation which makes up the bulk of national crime\u000d\u000a      rates &#8212; and over-estimates victimisation risk, and underestimates repeat\u000d\u000a      victimisation while crime is best prevented when focussing on repeat\u000d\u000a      victims. Therefore victimisation research that truly informs theory and\u000d\u000a      crime prevention warrants examining the entire distribution of crime\u000d\u000a      incidents (rather than the dichotomy of victim\/non-victim) over both\u000d\u000a      contextual and individual risk factors. Finally, Professor Tseloni's work\u000d\u000a      examines these issues both intra- nationally (England &amp; Wales) and\u000d\u000a      cross-nationally (US and Greece). This research, which is another variant\u000d\u000a      on the crime incidence theme, also distinguishes between the mediated and\u000d\u000a      direct associations of crime experience and related outcomes, such as fear\u000d\u000a      of crime or punitiveness. This research is on-going, and current research\u000d\u000a      plans seek to bring together repeat victimisation modelling and repeat\u000d\u000a      victim profiling to assist police operations.\u000d\u000a    International crime drop and security (see research references\u000d\u000a      4-6) (On-going since 2006).\u000d\u000a    Crime has fallen massively in recent times across the world, but until\u000d\u000a      Professor Tseloni's collaborative work on this theme existing research\u000d\u000a      focussed on the US and Canada and explanations centred around the\u000d\u000a      potential beneficial effect of criminal justice policies and other legal\u000d\u000a      changes that occurred in these countries. Her collaborative work, which\u000d\u000a      expanded on a methodology she had previously developed for examining the\u000d\u000a      effect of political systems on crime rates showed that the crime falls\u000d\u000a      were international in nature. This research then tested international\u000d\u000a      rather than criminal justice explanations, in particular the hypothesis\u000d\u000a      that generalised and improved security was the main driver of crime falls.\u000d\u000a      The analysis confirmed that the security hypothesis holds with regards to\u000d\u000a      the vehicle crime drops cross-nationally and to some extent for the fall\u000d\u000a      in burglary across England and Wales. More recently she employed Wang\u000d\u000a      counts modelling to show that deterrence is effective only for individuals\u000d\u000a      with `rational' crime propensities. This on-going research will be\u000d\u000a      expanded upon through a current ESRC-SDAI funded research project that\u000d\u000a      examines which burglary security devices work for whom, and in what\u000d\u000a      context. This body of research is reflected within a recent publication\u000d\u000a      (Van Dijk, J. Tseloni, A. and Farrell, G. [2012].

Our evidence was\u000a        an integral part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's research round-up\u000a        document (McDonagh, 2011), which was given to all delegates and\u000a        placed on the JRF web site. A high level representative from the\u000a        Department for Communities and Local Government stated that this\u000a        `powerful evidence' would be fed into the cross departmental Ministerial\u000a        Working Group on Homelessness. Findings were also endorsed by Grant\u000a        Shapps, Minister for Housing and Local Government, in an accompanying\u000a        press release (Homeless Link, 2011), and a delegate from the Department\u000a        for Work and Pensions commended their value in highlighting the support\u000a        needed in securing labour market access for adults with complex needs\u000a        (Department for Work and Pensions, Labour Market Inclusion Division\u000a        e-mail). Since then, the Ministerial Working Group has acknowledged the\u000a        influence of the Multiple Exclusion Homelessness Programme on its most\u000a        recent proposals on homelessness (Department for Communities and Local\u000a        Government, 2012, pp.8-10, 13) which share the importance that our\u000a        research demonstrated of the role played by homeless people's encounters\u000a        with support services in either preventing or causing homelessness.\u000a        Likewise, our findings that multiple disadvantages compound one another\u000a        in reinforcing homelessness and other problems has been recognised by\u000a        the Government's Social Justice Cabinet Committee in urging a\u000a        multi-agency approach to acute deprivation (Department for Work and\u000a        Pensions, 2012, p.49).\u000a      At local level, impact has been achieved through the\u000a        long-standing relationship between Bowpitt and Framework Housing\u000a        Association mainly through the sponsorship of postgraduate students\u000a        noted above. Framework Housing Association has testified to the value of\u000a        its research, including that undertaken in collaboration with Nottingham\u000a        Trent University (Research reference one; Walsh, 2006). Exploratory\u000a        research informs the way they work and evaluative research tests the\u000a        quality of services and measures its benefit to service users, all as a\u000a        basis for developing and sharing good practice.\u000a      \u000aWider local reach has been achieved through the HOME Study,\u000a        during which two practitioner workshops in London and Nottingham in\u000a        December\/January, 2010\/11 were attended by managers and practitioners\u000a        from public and voluntary sector services used by homeless people, at\u000a        which early findings from the ESRC funded study were presented and\u000a        debated. Subsequent to these events, delegates have indicated ways in\u000a        which findings have been used by their respective organisations in, for\u000a        instance, informing service specification for commissioners (Notts\u000a        Supporting People Team, Commissioning Officer e-mail) or supporting bids\u000a        for funding (Big Life Group, Executive Director e-mail).

It has taken several forms:\u000a    \u000a      Small-scale projects have been undertaken, some with the help of\u000a        Framework Housing Association sponsorship of postgraduate research\u000a        students at Nottingham Trent University over a substantial period\u000a        (1996-2012), to evaluate Framework Housing Association services. Bowpitt\u000a        was involved in supervising the students, and drawing out the\u000a        significance of the findings. For instance, an evaluation of a hostel\u000a        for people with long-term mental health problems demonstrated the value\u000a        of enabling ex-residents to continue using hostel facilities (Research\u000a        Reference 1). A comparison between `total abstinence' and `controlled\u000a        drinking' approaches in hostels for people with alcohol problems\u000a        challenged the received wisdom that the latter method cannot work with\u000a        people with severe alcohol dependency (Walsh, 2006). An evaluation of\u000a        support for tenants with continuing drug problems was undertaken in 2006\u000a        by Framework staff and subsequently written up for publication by\u000a        Bowpitt (Research Reference 2). It showed that relationships with\u000a        support workers had intrinsic value beyond the provision of risk\u000a        management services.\u000a      A more substantial project (Publication 3) was funded during 2009-11\u000a        by the ESRC under its `multiple exclusion homelessness' research\u000a        programme (RES-188-25-0001). The purpose of the programme was to\u000a        understand more fully how social exclusion factors conspire to entrench\u000a        vulnerable adults in patterns of street homelessness, and to recommend\u000a        improvements in policy and practice. Graham Bowpitt, Professor Peter\u000a        Dwyer (Professor of Social Policy, who moved to the University of\u000a        Salford in 2010, and to the University of York in 2013), Eva Sundin\u000a        (Reader in Psychology) and Mark Weinstein (Senior Lecturer in Social\u000a        Research Methods), all at the time from Nottingham Trent University,\u000a        were one of four teams nationally to receive funding from this\u000a        programme, in our case, for a project to look at the role of conflicting\u000a        priorities between single homeless people and support agencies in\u000a        sustaining multiple exclusion homelessness. The HOME Study\u000a        (Research Reference 3) was undertaken in collaboration with Framework\u000a        Housing Association and Thames Reach in London who facilitated access to\u000a        research participants and peer researchers. Interviews with 108 multiply\u000a        excluded homeless people and 44 key informants from support agencies in\u000a        the voluntary and public sectors in Nottingham and London revealed that\u000a        conflicting priorities between homeless people and support agencies\u000a        impede attempts to tackle multiple exclusion where the conditions that\u000a        attach to receipt of services cannot be met, where homeless people are\u000a        deterred from using services, or where they are deemed ineligible due to\u000a        statutory or regulatory restrictions. Subsequent analysis has shown that\u000a        women are as likely to experience these barriers as men (Research\u000a        Reference 4), but that service delivery that stresses holistic\u000a        approaches, unconditional acceptance and the use of key workers to\u000a        deliver bespoke packages of support, are more likely to be successful\u000a        (Research References 5 and 6).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33444","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Clearly, the work of the CWDC encouraged the enhancement of supervisory\u000d\u000a      practice in\u000d\u000a      accordance with principles of good practice.

Most significantly, however, it was the\u000d\u000a      theorization of the project within\u000d\u000a      its wider context that enabled new insights to be generated.

In consequence, in\u000d\u000a      2010 it introduced the Support to Front Line Managers (SFLM) project. This\u000d\u000a      project provided an\u000d\u000a      opportunity for the 152 LAs in England to receive funding for initiatives\u000d\u000a      that would continue to\u000d\u000a      develop the supervisory skills of front line managers. The underpinning\u000d\u000a      empirical project that later\u000d\u000a      gave rise to new insights was the evaluation of this national initiative.\u000d\u000a    The evaluation took place in England between 2010 and 2011 involving\u000d\u000a      Professor Elizabeth\u000d\u000a      Harlow (Professor, University of Chester, Sept 2010 &#8212; present) and two\u000d\u000a      other collaborators\u000d\u000a      (Professor Nicky Stanley, UCLAN, and Dr Gordon Blunt). The main data\u000d\u000a      initially available for\u000d\u000a      analysis consisted of the administrative documents that had been\u000d\u000a      constructed and circulated by\u000d\u000a      the CWDC (or their representatives): that is, the proposals, progress and\u000d\u000a      monitoring reports that\u000d\u000a      had been submitted by the participating LAs. Of the 86 LAs that\u000d\u000a      participated in the project, there\u000d\u000a      were data available for the evaluation from 81. Although not all of these\u000d\u000a      documents were available\u000d\u000a      for all 81 participating LAs, 164 documents were examined in total.

Moreover, Pitt points out that \"the\u000d\u000a      post-Woolwich backlash has also vindicated the emphasis [Lambert's]\u000d\u000a      research has placed on the threat posed by the far right, an aspect of\u000d\u000a      violent extremism that has unfortunately been underestimated both by state\u000d\u000a      agencies and by the media\".\u000d\u000a    The President of the Muslim Association of Britain says that [Lambert's]\u000d\u000a      research \"has helped to inform the debate about violent extremism; inform\u000d\u000a      the debate about the war on terror and inform the debate about\u000d\u000a      Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate crimes\" which \"offers a model for a\u000d\u000a      multi-agency partnership approach to tackling violent extremism; a model\u000d\u000a      for tackling Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate crime; and a model for more\u000d\u000a      effective and legitimate counter-terrorism policing\".

Research funded by the FCO into Vietnamese and Chinese organised\u000d\u000a      crime were the first projects to map the influence of these emerging crime\u000d\u000a      groups in the UK.

Key findings have been to persuade\u000d\u000a      policy makers to rethink the apparent levels of organisation within\u000d\u000a      emerging organised crime threats and to reconfigure any threat as an\u000d\u000a      asymmetrical one embedded in law abiding communities.\u000d\u000a    Contextualising and redefining the threat from `Islamist' groups in\u000d\u000a        the UK: Lambert and Ridley have been involved in several\u000d\u000a      research projects revaluating the scope and policing of the `Islamist\u000d\u000a      threat'. Lambert was engaged as a consultant on two projects from\u000d\u000a      2007, one ESRC funded, Cultures of Repression: the Legacy of Colonial\u000d\u000a      Violence and State Repression in the Maghreb, and its Effect on North\u000d\u000a      African Diasporas in Europe and the other AHRC funded, An Examination of\u000d\u000a      Partnership Approaches to Challenging Religiously-Endorsed Violence\u000d\u000a      involving Muslim Groups and Police.

They challenge current strategies of\u000d\u000a      policing, arguing that they are potentially counter-productive by\u000d\u000a      alienating the community the police service is dependent on for\u000d\u000a      information, whilst not adequately investigating the underlying financial\u000d\u000a      aspects of `terrorist' funding\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33613","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our innovative methodologies and carefully crafted recommendations that\u000d\u000a      are rooted in rigorous evaluation and research have led to transformative\u000d\u000a      changes in three interlinked areas: integration of practices that\u000d\u000a      victim-survivors identify as most valuable into support services; more\u000d\u000a      equitable distribution of specialist support services in the statutory and\u000d\u000a      NGO sectors; enhanced criminal justice responses to victim-survivors of\u000d\u000a      rape. The evaluations of SARCs prompted the largest expansion of statutory\u000d\u000a      services for victim-survivors of rape in contemporary history, with the\u000d\u000a      SARC model being rolled out nationally: from the three when we began the\u000d\u000a      evaluations to 33 in November 2012. This represents an investment by\u000d\u000a      central government of more than &#163;10 million. Recommendations that we made\u000d\u000a      with respect to key elements of a SARC were integrated into national\u000d\u000a      standards issued by the Department of Health in 2005 and 2009 e.g.\u000d\u000a      preferences among female and male victim-survivors for female forensic\u000d\u000a      examiners, a model of practice which begins from a `culture of belief' and\u000d\u000a      respect, and pro-active advocacy. Thus the core findings from the initial\u000d\u000a      evaluation continue to inform how responses to victim-survivors of rape\u000d\u000a      are delivered. Pro-active advocacy in particular has developed\u000d\u000a      considerably. The Home Office and Ministry of Justice currently fund 60\u000d\u000a      Independent Sexual Violence Advisors (ISVAs) at &#163;1.72m in every year up to\u000d\u000a      2015. The model has also been adopted with respect to domestic violence,\u000d\u000a      with 1400 Independent Domestic Violence Advisors trained in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales. Successive government VAW action plans have continued to highlight\u000d\u000a      pro-active advocacy as a key plank of support provision. An unprecedented\u000d\u000a      level of funding &#8212; &#163;3.3m in every year up to 2015 &#8212; accompanies this. New\u000d\u000a      policy agendas are also recognising the importance of pro-active advocacy\u000d\u000a      e.g. work on gangs and child sexual exploitation.\u000d\u000a    As a direct outcome of our studies on attrition the Crown Prosecution\u000d\u000a      Service (CPS) now track the progress of rape cases through their own data\u000d\u000a      systems. The evident failings of criminal justice agencies led to a raft\u000d\u000a      of policy measures including training, guidance for prosecutors begun in\u000d\u000a      2007, and enhanced monitoring of rape cases One explanation for so many\u000d\u000a      cases failing to reach prosecution was what we termed a `culture of\u000d\u000a      scepticism' in the criminal justice system. Recently several\u000d\u000a      senior police officers have explicitly used the concept and in 2012, in\u000d\u000a      the wake of the Jimmy Savile enquiries, the Keir Starmer, Director of\u000d\u000a      Public Prosecutions, pledged to move the CPS away from this approach to\u000d\u000a      complainants:\u000d\u000a    Professor Liz Kelly and CWASU have worked closely with the Crown\u000d\u000a        Prosecution Service since 2003...

When the second report was published, the Equality and Human\u000d\u000a      Rights Commission (EHRC) used the findings as an `acid test' of how local\u000d\u000a      authorities were meeting obligations under the then Gender Equality Duty.\u000d\u000a      Each local authority identified as having no specialised VAW services\u000d\u000a      (n=93) was asked to provide details of any existing or planned provision.\u000d\u000a      Those who were assessed as non-compliant with legal obligations were asked\u000d\u000a      to explain why. The Rape Crisis Network England and Wales used the reports\u000d\u000a      in their influencing work, and as a result the current government has\u000d\u000a      invested &#163;11million to secure existing centres and open 18 new ones in the\u000d\u000a      life time of the parliament:\u000d\u000a    This document enabled us to lobby and produce policy documents around\u000d\u000a        the lack of provision nationally, but particularly highlighting the East\u000d\u000a        Region [as least resourced]. As a result, the East Region now has\u000d\u000a        a Rape Crisis Centre in every county. This means we have been able to\u000d\u000a        address and reduce the post code lottery for women's access to\u000d\u000a        specialist support. I would say this has been one of the most\u000d\u000a        significant impacts, in terms of service provision and policy, because\u000d\u000a        it was directly used to inform and increase service provision (Chair\u000d\u000a      of Rape Crisis Network England and Wales).\u000d\u000a    The minimum standards for specialist VAW services have been incorporated\u000d\u000a      into the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on Violence Against Women and\u000d\u000a      Domestic Violence, which now has 26 signatories, including the UK. This\u000d\u000a      places requirements on member states to provide resources for\u000d\u000a      victim-survivors in line with our recommended standards e.g. shelter\u000d\u000a      places, free national helplines. The document has also been used by a\u000d\u000a      number of European networks (for example, the European Women's Lobby,\u000d\u000a      Women Against Violence Europe (WAVE), European Institute of Gender\u000d\u000a      Equality) and national NGOs to inform the development of strategies and\u000d\u000a      action plans. UN Women are currently using the recommendations to underpin\u000d\u000a      a regional advocacy strategy on VAW support services across South Eastern\u000d\u000a      Europe. The national strategy on gender-based violence in the Republic of\u000d\u000a      Ireland (COSC, 2010) uses the study as a starting point for assessing the\u000d\u000a      levels of support provision needed.\u000d\u000a    The influence of our research has been to define promising practices\u000d\u000a      which meet the needs of victim-survivors and embed these into a number of\u000d\u000a      policy frameworks and action plans.

We have\u000d\u000a      evaluated new and emerging forms of support provision (Sexual Assault\u000d\u000a      Referral Centres), tracked attrition in criminal justice responses to rape\u000d\u000a      in England, Wales and Europe, mapped the `postcode lottery' of specialist\u000d\u000a      services across Great Britain, and developed minimum standards for\u000d\u000a      specialist services across Europe. Our research highlighted promising\u000d\u000a      practices that led to a national rollout of specific forms of provision\u000d\u000a      and central government funding for specialist services. We were among the\u000d\u000a      first researchers in the UK to draw on human rights principles to\u000d\u000a      illuminate the responsibilities of states to provide services, principles\u000d\u000a      further elaborated in the 2011 Council of Europe Convention.

A subsequent study evaluated the first SARC in Scotland.\u000d\u000a      2. Attrition in reported rape cases, comprising three European\u000d\u000a        studies: 2000-2001, 2001-2003 and 2007-2009 (all funded by the EU Daphne\u000d\u000a        programme) and a study in England and Wales (2000-2004; funded by the\u000d\u000a        Home Office). The first two projects established a methodology for\u000d\u000a        tracking attrition trends over time. The British study sought to unpick\u000d\u000a        this trend through prospectively tracking a large sample (n=1442) of\u000d\u000a        reported rape cases. The final European study built on the previous\u000d\u000a        projects, updating the national time series data alongside research\u000d\u000a        partners in 10 countries retrospectively tracking 100 consecutive cases\u000d\u000a        through the criminal justice process. Together these projects were the\u000d\u000a        first to highlight attrition points in the investigation and prosecution\u000d\u000a        of rape, the role of alcohol and a `culture of scepticism' within the\u000d\u000a        police and CPS.\u000d\u000a      3. Mapping Specialised Violence Against Women Services.

The results revealed a `postcode lottery' across\u000d\u000a        nations and regions, and powerfully highlighted areas where no\u000d\u000a        specialist services existed.\u000d\u000a      4. Minimum standards for specialised VAW support services. This\u000d\u000a        project, funded by the Council of Europe (2007-2008) linked human rights\u000d\u000a        principles with the availability of services that support\u000d\u000a        victim-survivors. The proposed standards made recommendations for a\u000d\u000a        minimum level of availability and distribution of specialised services\u000d\u000a        (by population\/region) alongside overarching policy and practice\u000d\u000a        principles (e.g. confidentiality, empowerment, providing options) and\u000d\u000a        service specific standards for refuges, rape crisis centres, counselling\u000d\u000a        centres and advocacy.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34479","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has led to changes in government policy regarding adoption,\u000d\u000a      and achieved direct impacts on the provision of services and practice for\u000d\u000a      disabled children and their families.\u000d\u000a    As a direct result of the team's adoption activity day evaluations, the\u000d\u000a      Department for Education (DfE) announced in December 2012 that these\u000d\u000a      activity days would become part of the government's adoption reform agenda\u000d\u000a      and be rolled out across England and Wales [A].

It can be argued, however, that the removal of\u000d\u000a      barriers alone is counter-productive in that it defines the disabled\u000d\u000a      person as the focal point of the problem. Critical Disability Studies, a\u000d\u000a      fairly young discipline, challenges that focus on barrier removal,\u000d\u000a      advocating a fundamental shift in thinking towards a different concept of\u000d\u000a      what is normal.\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) has undertaken a\u000d\u000a      sustained programme of research in Critical Disability Studies, involving\u000d\u000a      Dan Goodley (Professor of Psychology and Disability Studies, 2007-2011);\u000d\u000a      Dr Rebecca Lawthom (Reader in Community Practice, since 1999); and Dr\u000d\u000a      Katherine Runswick-Cole (Research Fellow, since 2008). The research fell\u000d\u000a      into three distinct areas:\u000d\u000a    The first project, Does Every Child Matter, post Blair? The\u000d\u000a      interconnections of disabled childhoods ran from 2008 to 2011. Funded\u000d\u000a      through external grants, it pioneered a Critical Disability Studies\u000d\u000a      approach to reposition understandings of childhood and disability. Through\u000d\u000a      repeated interviews with 30 families and allied professionals, as well as\u000d\u000a      focus groups, the project explored the experiences of children aged 5 to\u000d\u000a      16 in areas including health, education, social care and leisure. Key\u000d\u000a      findings included the fact that joined-up provision is required for\u000d\u000a      children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities\u000d\u000a      (SEND) and their families [3.1] disabled children continue to\u000d\u000a      experience discrimination, violence and educational exclusion [3.3,\u000d\u000a        3.4]; families of disabled children and young people value short\u000d\u000a      breaks, yet barriers remain to accessing them; and that disabled children\u000d\u000a      who participate in community arts develop positive identities and a sense\u000d\u000a      of community [3.5]. The project also identified a shifting policy\u000d\u000a      agenda for disabled children and young people [3.1, 3.2].\u000d\u000a    The second project, which ran in 2011\/2012 and was funded by the\u000d\u000a      disability charity, Scope, examined resilience in the lives of disabled\u000d\u000a      people across the life course. The study drew on the life stories of 42\u000d\u000a      disabled people aged 5 to 83, followed by focus groups and the development\u000d\u000a      of a resilience toolkit. Findings included the insight that resilience is\u000d\u000a      not a personal character trait, but is made in relationships with others\u000d\u000a      and with access to resources; and that resilience can be developed through\u000d\u000a      recognizing the interdependent nature of people's lives [3.6]. The\u000d\u000a      toolkit, including a resilience map, was the main practical outcome.\u000d\u000a    The third project, carried out in 2011\/2012, examined the effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of adoption activity days &#8212; days when children and their social workers\u000d\u000a      have the chance to meet prospective adoptive parents over organised \"fun\"\u000d\u000a      activities, without the prospective adopters knowing the children's\u000d\u000a      history up front. The research involved Runswick-Cole participating as a\u000d\u000a      volunteer and charting her observations, as well as interviewing\u000d\u000a      prospective adopters, children and other participants. She found that\u000d\u000a      adoption activity days are a successful means of family finding,\u000d\u000a      particularly for children labelled `hard to place'. There was no evidence\u000d\u000a      that parents and children matched up in this way are more likely to\u000d\u000a      experience breakdown (Runswick-Cole, Hocking, Betts and Goodley (in\u000d\u000a      preparation).

They studied the\u000d\u000a      development of justice reinvestment in the US and early attempts to\u000d\u000a      implement it in the UK, particularly in Greater Manchester, where as well\u000d\u000a      as undertaking research they advised on the Transforming Justice\u000d\u000a      agenda. The result of this research was a series of articles [5 and 6]\u000d\u000a      and latterly a book [2].\u000d\u000a    In parallel Fox and Albertson argued for the better integration of\u000d\u000a      practice in offender resettlement with new models of commissioning. When\u000d\u000a      the Coalition government introduced its `Rehabilitation Revolution' Fox\u000d\u000a      and Albertson undertook the first substantial academic analysis of Payment\u000d\u000a      by Results, Social Impact Bonds [3 and 4], based in part on a\u000d\u000a      further set of commissioned consultancy and evaluation projects [12\u000d\u000a        and 13] that have provided them with valuable insights into Payment\u000d\u000a      by Results from both the commissioner and provider perspectives.\u000d\u000a    The MMU approach is inter-disciplinary and multi-method and grounded in\u000d\u000a      the application of economic theory and methods to an analysis of criminal\u000d\u000a      justice. The model of commissioning offender resettlement developed has 3\u000d\u000a      dimensions:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      At the centre of the model (micro) is the relationship between\u000d\u000a        individual offenders and criminal justice professionals (and sometimes\u000d\u000a        volunteers) who work with them. We have not developed new resettlement\u000d\u000a        approaches, rather we have shown how a number of existing personalised\u000d\u000a        approaches including desistance-based approaches such as the Good Lives\u000d\u000a        Model can be integrated into a holistic approach to offender\u000d\u000a        resettlement.\u000d\u000a      The next level (meso) considers the organisational context and\u000d\u000a        commissioning arrangements that are best able to deliver this model of\u000d\u000a        offender management.

MacDonald and Shildrick have worked\u000a      closely with the University's Press Office, research funders and research\u000a      users so as to maximise the reach, accessibility, timeliness and policy\/\u000a      practice relevance of the research `messages'.\u000a    For reasons of space, some examples of how impact has been\u000a            achieved are given here in respect of only the most\u000a      recent study: Are `cultures of worklessness' passed down the\u000a        generations? (Study 5). The University Press Office helped the\u000a      researchers to gain widespread newspaper coverage (e.g. Financial\u000a        Times, The Independent, The Observer, Daily Record, The Herald).\u000a      Their comment piece in The Guardian received 500+ posted replies\u000a      within 24 hours. Social media was also used to generate wide dissemination\u000a      and debate beyond academia. An `infographic' from this study reached over\u000a      1 million Twitter users (according to JRF calculations). There were over\u000a      5k hits in one month on MacDonald's blog about this research (the most\u000a      successful JRF blog in 2012). Alongside Studies 1 to 4, Study 5 also\u000a      featured in MacDonald and Shildrick's Knowledge Exchange Project\u000a      (KEP), funded by the Institute for Local Governance (ILG) and\u000a      Middlesbrough Council (MC). During 2011-12, nearly 400 people from over\u000a      100 different North East statutory, voluntary and private sector\u000a      organisations attended at least one of seven KEP events in which the\u000a      research was used to `bust myths' about poverty and worklessness and where\u000a      participants were challenged about how they might use it to help tackle\u000a      these problems.\u000a    The following are examples of the impact on thinking and\u000a            practice that have been achieved:\u000a\u0009\u0009\u0009\u000a    Extensive, staged and separate evaluations of the impact of the KEP\u000a      have been undertaken by the researchers and by ILG [see evidence 1 and 2\u000a      in respect of all examples, below, related to this KEP]. ILG presented\u000a      this KEP to a 2012 seminar of the ESRC's Knowledge Exchange Division as an\u000a      `excellent' and `innovative example' of how to foster productive\u000a      engagement between local governance institutions and universities. ILG\u000a      concluded that it had led to:\u000a      (a) `conceptual' impact that `reframed debates'\u000a      (e.g. one community organisation commented: `it gave front line\u000a      organisations, unemployed people themselves and movers and shakers many\u000a      questions as well as potential answers...without any doubt at all the\u000a      MacDonald\/ Shildrick work has become a catalyst for exploding many of the\u000a      myths surrounding worklessness');\u000a      (b)`changing state' impact: three-quarters of\u000a      evaluation respondents said that the research was `useful or very useful\u000a      in supporting their work' and were `now thinking and\/ or acting\u000a      differently' as a consequence. For instance, it energised social housing,\u000a      youth work and community organisations, welfare to work providers, Job\u000a      Centre Plus and several council departments towards tackling poverty and\u000a      `the low-pay, no-pay cycle' and creating new opportunities and networks to\u000a      do this. For example, Job Centre Plus reported that they were now more\u000a      closely attuned to the needs of the short-term unemployed, MC ran\u000a      a very successful benefit take-up campaign in one of the research\u000a      neighbourhoods and one FE college reflected on their `curriculum...and\u000a      reformed support services for students', all as a result of hearing about\u000a      the research.\u000a      (c) and `instrumental' impact. Organisations used\u000a      the KEP to inform strategic planning, priority setting or decision-making.\u000a      The Chief Executive of MC said the research had `major impact on our\u000a      understanding of the needs of local citizens' and would `influence the\u000a      delivery of services from a number of agencies in the future'.\u000a    The research has influenced campaigns to tackle poverty and for a\u000a      Living Wage in the North East. Because of the reputation and impact of the\u000a      research, in 2012 MacDonald was invited by Northern TUC to\u000a      be a key note speaker (alongside the General Secretary of Unison) at a\u000a      conference to educate Trade Union activists (around 70 participated) about\u000a      `in-work poverty' and the Living Wage. The Conference Chair ensured that\u000a      research findings were then distributed to all participants and the TUC\u000a      Regional Secretary has drawn on the research in several articles he has\u000a      written for newspapers. Consequently, the research had a `very direct\u000a      influence' on Northern TUC's 2013 `Public services campaign strategy'\u000a      which had `a stronger element on supporting economically excluded and\u000a      vulnerable workers', the `evidence and thinking' here being `informed\u000a      directly' by the research [evidence 3]. In 2013 the MP for Middlesbrough\u000a      launched the `Make Middlesbrough a Living Wage Town'\u000a      campaign, directly using MacDonald and Shildrick's research in his opening\u000a      speech. They were then invited to speak at the inaugural meeting, to chief\u000a      executives of local companies. The campaign team regards the research as a\u000a      `vital component in shaping public policy', arguing that it `has helped\u000a      make a case...to campaign for secure, properly paid jobs with decent terms\u000a      and conditions' [evidence 4].\u000a    The research has also had impact on practice nationally. MacDonald was\u000a      invited to join the JRF advisory group as an academic expert on the Future\u000a        of the UK Labour Market (2010-13). From this in 2011 he was asked by\u000a      the employment and skills provider, Reed in Partnership, to\u000a      provide expert `insight and constructive challenge' for their tender to\u000a      the DWP to help `families with multiple needs'. Their bid was successful.\u000a      MacDonald's input was acknowledged as `really helpful and valuable' in\u000a      `develop[ing] credible and appropriate proposals' to help families towards\u000a      employment and, subsequently, in helping Reed in Partnership's approach to\u000a      `the delivery [model] of the programme' [evidence 5].\u000a    Also in respect of practice with `families with multiple needs',\u000a      Shildrick and MacDonald were asked by the Children's Workforce\u000a          Development Council (CWDC) to collaborate in the production of\u000a      a training manual for practitioners. This followed a 2011 research\u000a      presentation given by Shildrick at the Child Poverty Unit\/ DWP. New case\u000a      study material from Study 4 (about `the low-pay, no-pay cycle') was\u000a      produced for the manual. CWDC commented that `it is only as a result of\u000a      this inclusion that the resource is of such a high quality, supporting\u000a      practitioners in their work with families' [evidence 6].\u000a    The research has also informed political debates at UK and EU level:\u000a      in 2010 MacDonald was an academic expert witness to a House of\u000a          Commons Children, Schools and Families Select Committee Inquiry into\u000a          `Young People not in Education, Employment and Training (NEET)'\u000a      with his research evidence considered by the outgoing Labour government\u000a      and the incoming Coalition [evidence 7]. In 2012, Shildrick was invited to\u000a      present research to a House of Commons All-party Working Group on\u000a          `In-work Poverty'. Subsequently, findings about the `low-pay,\u000a      no-pay cycle' and disputing the idea of `cultures of worklessness' have\u000a      been referred to directly in debates in both Houses of Parliament\u000a      [evidence 8]. Baroness Lister commented: `This evidence is going to be\u000a      invaluable in fighting the pernicious cut in benefits... it challenges the\u000a      conventional wisdom that only those in work are `strivers' and that all\u000a      those out of work on benefit are `skivers' [evidence 9]. On the basis of\u000a      her active membership of the North East Child Poverty Commission and the\u000a      reputation of the research, Shildrick acted as academic advisor to an\u000a      `Opinion' piece for the EU's Committee of the Regions that was adopted as\u000a      an EU Recommendation on Communication on Child Poverty in\u000a      2012 [evidence 10].\u000a\u0009  \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Funded by JRF and ESRC, a long-term series of qualitative studies with\u000a      residents of very deprived neighbourhoods in Teesside has reached\u000a      important conclusions about the realities of worklessness and poverty.\u000a      Many of these run counter to prevailing thinking amongst politicians,\u000a      policy makers and practitioners. Thus, the research has been used to\u000a      influence the thinking and the practices of organisations (nationally and\u000a      regionally) that seek to tackle problems of poverty and worklessness.

Sharing first authorship across research teams in\u000a      the Social Futures Institute, between them they have led a series of five\u000a      studies funded by JRF and ESRC (from 1998 to 2012). Each has been won\u000a      competitively (e.g. the 5th study was one of only 5 funded by\u000a      JRF from over 630 applications) and each has produced numerous outputs as\u000a      well as the main report or monograph (e.g. see publications under section\u000a      3).\u000a    Studies 1, 2 and 3 - published as Snakes and Ladders (Johnston,\u000a      2000), Disconnected Youth? (MacDonald and Marsh, 2005) and Poor\u000a        Transitions (Webster, 2004) - provided a long-term, broad-ranging\u000a      and longitudinal analysis of youth transitions and social exclusion in\u000a      some of England's most deprived neighbourhoods. This work has been\u000a      referred to as `the most intensive example of youth transitions research\u000a      in the UK' (Gunter and Watt, 2009: 516). Studies 4 and 5 have extended\u000a      analysis from young people to adults and have had a stronger focus on\u000a      poverty and worklessness. Poverty and Insecurity (Shildrick et al,\u000a      2012a) examined the dynamics of `recurrent poverty' over working lives and\u000a      explored how not just young people but adults too can become trapped in\u000a      `churning' between unemployment and low paid, insecure employment. The 5th\u000a      study &#8212; Are `cultures of worklessness' passed down the generations?\u000a      (Shildrick et al, 2012b) - provided a critical case study of influential\u000a      but controversial claims that worklessness can be explained by families\u000a      encouraging and passing on `welfare dependency'. Main conclusions from\u000a      this body of work include:\u000a    \u000a      Young people in deprived neighbourhoods face multiple pressures and\u000a        `critical moments' that disrupt transitions to adulthood. Orthodox `risk\u000a        factor' approaches to social exclusion are unable to capture the flux,\u000a        complexity and variation of these transitions [outputs 1, 2, and 3].\u000a      Insecure `poor work' remains relatively abundant and is critical in\u000a        shaping work histories of recurrent poverty and entrapment in the\u000a        `low-pay, no-pay cycle' [outputs 1 and 5].\u000a      `Positive' motivations towards work persist even under conditions of\u000a        long-term, high unemployment; this is evident across generations and\u000a        genders [outputs 5 and 6].\u000a      Paradoxically, people living in poverty can deny `poverty' as a label\u000a        for themselves and reiterate negative stereotypes about `poor people'\u000a        [output 4].\u000a      Influential ideas about `three generations of families who have never\u000a        worked' and intergenerational `cultures of worklessness' do not\u000a        adequately explain worklessness in the UK [output 6].\u000a      Low-paid, insecure employment does not protect against poverty\u000a        therefore government policy needs to be much more concerned with not\u000a        only increasing the quantity of jobs but also with increasing their\u000a        quality [publications 5 &amp; 6].\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35407","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"783754","Name":"Albania"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research has achieved impact of international reach and\u000a      significance through the uptake of research findings by governmental\u000a      organisations and NGOs. The originality of Professor Antonopoulos's work\u000a      makes his outputs definitive sources of information in the areas of\u000a      migrant and cigarette smuggling. For example, to date his is the most\u000a      detailed work into migrant smuggling in Greece. The applied nature of the\u000a      underpinning research, coupled with Professor Antonopoulos's engagement\u000a      with organisations, such as the Cross Border Crime Colloquium (www.cross-border-crime.net),\u000a      that explicitly seek to translate academic research findings into material\u000a      that is beneficial in policy and practice, has facilitated the use of the\u000a      underpinning research by a range of user groups. Furthermore, Professor\u000a      Antonopoulos has disseminated his findings in such a way as to ensure that\u000a      relevant practitioner groups could gain ready access to his research\u000a      findings. For example, he purposefully attends the European Society of\u000a        Criminology conferences annually because he is aware that this is a\u000a      conference where both practitioner and academic delegates are well\u000a      represented. A second example is that the European Journal of\u000a        Criminology was targeted as a place of publication because Professor\u000a      Antonopoulos knew that this is a favoured source of academic research for\u000a      many international agencies such as the Greek Police and Europol.\u000a    The nature of the impact is twofold in that firstly, findings have\u000a      contributed to the development of national and transnational policies on\u000a      health, illegal immigration, and markets of organised crime. Secondly, law\u000a      enforcement agencies across Europe have changed their practices in the\u000a      light of the research findings.\u000a    Contribution to Policy\u000a    Research findings have impacted upon transnational governmental policies\u000a      to combat illegal immigration. In 2008, findings from output 2 were used\u000a      in a report produced by the Hellenic Migration Policy Institute\u000a        (IMEPO), co-funded by the European Union, in order to estimate the\u000a      illegal immigrant population in Greece [evidence 1]. This estimate was\u000a      used to inform proposals for Albanian governmental policy relating to the\u000a      effective and sustainable implementation of Readmission Agreements between\u000a      Albania, the EC and concerned third countries [evidence 2]; such\u000a      Agreements aimed to facilitate the readmission of unauthorised migrants to\u000a      their nation of origin. Similarly, in 2009, findings from output 1 were\u000a      submitted to the Directorate General for Migration Policy and Social\u000a        Integration of the Greek Ministry of Internal Affairs in order to\u000a      facilitate the strategy for the assisted return and reintegration of\u000a      illegal migrants in Greece to their country of origin [evidence 3].\u000a    The underpinning research into cigarette smuggling has had a direct\u000a      impact on national health policies in different countries. The findings of\u000a      this research have allowed Governmental organisations to assess the demand\u000a      for contraband cigarettes, and the resulting health effects of this, under\u000a      different policy scenarios. For example, in 2010\/2011, the US government\u000a      considered a ban on menthol cigarettes on the grounds of public health. In\u000a      January 2011, the Centre for Regulatory Effectiveness, an\u000a      independent US governmental organisation tasked with ensuring that\u000a      information used to develop federal regulations is of the highest quality\u000a      (www.thecre.com), produced a report\u000a      [evidence 4] considering the effects that a ban on menthol cigarettes\u000a      would have on demand for contraband cigarettes. The findings of output 5,\u000a      regarding the organisation of illegal tobacco markets, the health risks\u000a      posed by their products and the distribution of goods to the US, were\u000a      cited extensively in this report and contributed to the recommendation to\u000a      the US Food and Drugs Agency that a ban should not be supported.\u000a    Findings from the underpinning research have also played a role in\u000a      international aims to reduce cigarette smuggling and its effects. The New\u000a      Zealand anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH; www.ash.org.nz), which lobbies the New\u000a      Zealand government, produced a report in June 2010 [evidence 5] which\u000a      aimed to tackle the contraband cigarette market in New Zealand and to make\u000a      recommendations on the role that New Zealand could play in the\u000a      international community to help reduce cigarette smuggling worldwide.\u000a      Findings of [output 3] and [output 5] were cited in the ASH report in\u000a      order to provide a global picture on illegal markets of cigarette\u000a      smuggling and to inform policy recommendations.\u000a    Impact to Law Enforcement Practices\u000a    From 2006, findings from outputs 2, 3 and 4 were used conjointly by the\u000a      Greek Police as part of the process of moving from a reactive style of the\u000a      policing of illegal markets towards strategic planning and analysis. These\u000a      research findings were used to inform strategic decisions by police about\u000a      which markets to tackle [evidence 6]. Thus, the findings from the\u000a      underpinning research have had a direct impact on the practices of Greek\u000a      law enforcement agencies by informing their knowledge of illegal markets\u000a      which has in turn allowed them to act strategically in combatting them.\u000a    Findings from outputs 2, 3 and 4 were also used by EUROPOL (The Hague,\u000a      The Netherlands) from 2006 in their training of Criminal Intelligence\u000a      Analysts [evidence 7]. These research articles offer real-world case study\u000a      examples of the nature and extent of the cigarette and migrant smuggling\u000a      markets in Greece. In conjunction with other sources of evidence, these\u000a      findings contribute to the provision of a clear picture of the nature of\u000a      these markets across Europe. Such a picture provides a platform for\u000a      educating trainee officers about the nature of criminal markets, as well\u000a      as providing scenarios for training exercises.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study centres on a body of work carried out by one member of\u000a      staff, Professor Georgios Antonopoulos, into the illegal markets of\u000a      migrant and tobacco smuggling. The underpinning research has impacted both\u000a      upon law enforcement and health promotion practices and the development of\u000a      national and transnational policies designed to combat illegal\u000a      immigration, and the organisation and effects of illegal markets. Research\u000a      findings from 2006-2010 have been incorporated into national and\u000a      transnational policy documents and into the training and practice of law\u000a      enforcement officers.

Thus, studies\u000a      of Greece and China have academic, policy and practice relevance beyond\u000a      Greece and China.\u000a    The mapping of the extent and nature of migrant smuggling in Greece was\u000a      published in 2006 [outputs 1 and 2]. Work scoping the cigarette smuggling\u000a      business in Greece was carried out in two separate studies in 2006 and\u000a      2008 [outputs 3 and 4] and studies detailing the extent and effects of\u000a      China's cigarette counterfeiting business were published in 2010 [output\u000a      5].\u000a    The key researcher in this series of studies is Georgios Antonopoulos,\u000a      who held a lectureship in Criminology from 2006, was made Reader in 2011\u000a      and conferred in Professor in 2013.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37231","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This case study demonstrates how research has (i) enhanced cultural\u000a      insights into and understanding of mixed racial and ethnic mixing and\u000a      mixedness in Britain, and (ii) had an impact on the social awareness of\u000a      and approaches to mixed race populations, through the following channels:\u000a    1. Practitioner and Frontline Engagement:\u000a    The insights resulting from the three research projects were coalesced\u000a      into a permanent web- based resource, the Mix-d Museum (1) funded by the\u000a      AHRC (Lead: Caballero, &#163;24k, 2011-12). The site has had 10,000 visits and\u000a      over 27,000 page views since its launch in July 2012. Google analytics\u000a      shows that 45% of views come from 143 countries (2).\u000a    Independent consultants interviewed the founder of Mix-d, a social\u000a      enterprise supporting mixed race young people and a partner in the Mix-d\u000a      Museum project (3).\u000a    He stated that \"Caballero's research has benefited the subject and his\u000a        organisation immensely\". He further commented: \"We have drawn\u000a        heavily on Caballero's work which not only eliminates American bias,\u000a        displaces myths with up to date knowledge and understanding but allows\u000a        oral history to be captured and presented in a way that is digestible\u000a        and deliverable to various audiences including young people\".\u000a    During 2012, Mix-d incorporated findings from Caballero's research in\u000a      their presentations to and work with over 350 school children and 40-50\u000a      teachers, influencing curricula, such as, history and citizenship. The\u000a      Founder of Mix-d further indicated that \"a good visual representation\u000a        helps in finding the correct vocabulary to talk about the subject in\u000a        greater detail\" in reference specifically to teachers. In 2013,\u000a      Mix-d also used Caballero's work in their engagement with 250 foster\u000a      carers to help them raise awareness of the potential issues facing mixed\u000a      race children and equip them with appropriate understanding and resources.\u000a    Educators and students have made extensive use of the Museum. For\u000a      example, Whalley Range High School and Stretford Grammar School in\u000a      Manchester have incorporated the resource into their curriculum, while\u000a      students at Stretford have also produced a highly visible wall mural based\u000a      on the Mix-d Museum model to communicate their own understandings of\u000a      mixedness and family heritages to other students, teachers, parents and\u000a      visitors (3).\u000a    Other organisations, for example, BAAF (British Association of Adoption\u000a      and Fostering), have highlighted how they have drawn on Caballero's\u000a      research in their delivery of raising BME issues in adoption and fostering\u000a      to social work practitioners and carers. The Director of Research, Policy\u000a      and Development at BAAF has recommended that a specific journal article\u000a      produced by Caballero should be required reading for social workers (4).\u000a      The publication featuring this article has sold over 500 copies in the UK\u000a      and further copies were sold at the International Fostering and Adoption\u000a      Conference in Bilbao in July 2013.\u000a    2. Extensive Media Coverage and Engagement:\u000a    In 2010, the BBC approached Caballero to translate her research findings\u000a      from Project 2 into a single BBC4 programme. Upon reviewing the depth and\u000a      richness of the findings, the BBC decided to produce a three part series\u000a      to be aired on prime time BBC2 (Mixed Britannia &#8212; was broadcast between\u000a      October-November 2012 at 9.00pm). Caballero appeared in and acted as\u000a      academic consultant to the series (5,6) which was presented by George\u000a      Alaghiah and was well received by the public, gaining the second highest\u000a      recorded score (90%) on the BBC's audience satisfaction survey for a\u000a      current affairs programme. It also trended on Twitter, attracting positive\u000a      comments from viewers, including celebrity viewers such as Boy George\u000a      (270,000 followers) (6).\u000a    The series received critical acclaim and extensive media coverage as a\u000a      result of its challenge of existing perceptions of mixed race people,\u000a      couples and families, featuring on Radio 4 (4th\u000a        October 2011) and in The Guardian (5th,\u000a        9th and 20th October\u000a        2011), The Daily Telegraph (5th, 6th\u000a        October 2011), The Times (2nd, 7th\u000a        October 2011), The Daily Mail (6th October\u000a        2011) and The Independent (21st October\u000a        2011). The Guardian interviewed Caballero (4th\u000a      October 2011) for an article centring on the research and its\u000a      role in informing the programmes. Impact from the series continues to\u000a      raise social awareness through broadcasts by the BBC World Service.\u000a    In October 2011, Caballero provided academic guidance to BBC2 Newsnight\u000a      with the content of their special feature on Mixed Race Britain. The\u000a      producer commented on Caballero's input to the programme, saying that she\u000a      helped shape the programme's research on perceptions of mixed race\u000a      families in Britain (7). Newsnight's viewing figures in October 2011\u000a      averaged 664,000 per night.\u000a    3. Other Examples of Reach:\u000a    The British Academy has indicated that the research outcomes from Project\u000a      2 were `very valuable in helping to make the case' for the\u000a      continuation of its Small Grants Scheme (8). Disbanded in April 2011, the\u000a      scheme was restarted in January 2012 with new investment (&#163;1.5 million\u000a      over three years) from the Leverhulme Trust. In addition, the project was\u000a      highlighted as an exemplar of successful research enabled by the scheme\u000a      (9).\u000a    In February 2013, the Asian American Literary Review commissioned\u000a      Caballero to develop information cards for the Review's Special Issue on\u000a      Mixed Race (10) as part of their on-line teaching programme to\u000a      undergraduates and postgraduate students in 66 universities and colleges\u000a      across 9 countries.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research into mixed racial people, couples and families has enhanced\u000a      social awareness, corrected misconceptions and celebrated the heritage of\u000a      these groups.

Through qualitative analysis\u000a      with thirty-five couples and case studies of six children and six\u000a      grandparents, the research showed that the experiences of mixed racial,\u000a      ethnic and faith families can be incredibly diverse and multifaceted,\u000a      raising important implications for existing policy and practice\u000a      initiatives which often assume a notion of a shared racial, ethnic or\u000a      mixed faith experience.\u000a    2.

It\u000a      uncovered a wealth of archival material which presented a vigorous and\u000a      original challenge to existing ideas of the experience of mixed race\u000a      people during the time period. The research pointed to an overlooked sense\u000a      of everyday `ordinariness' for many people within this group where many of\u000a      their assumed difficulties and challenges, such as inherent `marginality'\u000a      or `confusion', were non-existent or transitory. Where it identified\u000a      issues, these tended to be related to wider social discourses, policies\u000a      and practices rather than individual daily lives. The research highlighted\u000a      a complex and diverse set of experiences for this group and traced how\u000a      many of the stereotypes that still inform perceptions of mixed race groups\u000a      today are rooted in the historical constructions (2).\u000a    3. `Insiders' or `outsiders'?

The research\u000a      generated rich data on the influence of space and place on the experiences\u000a      of this group, particularly how the mothers' and children's understandings\u000a      of their racialised identities were supported or challenged by social\u000a      attitudes towards racial or ethnic mixing in their neighbourhoods (1).\u000a    Key findings from the overall body of research challenge existing\u000a      conceptualisations of mixed race people, couples and families in the UK,\u000a      both in relation to contemporary and historical experiences.

Hitherto trauma\u000a      recovery was provided post-conflict. As a direct consequence of the Dundee\u000a      research a phased programme of training has developed across Palestine. To\u000a      date, the phased programme has included training nine hundred school\u000a      counsellors in Gaza in the indigenous Healing Trauma Combatting Hatred\u000a      (HTCH) programme; 50 school counsellors have been trained in the newly\u000a      developed Arabic culture-specific version of the world leading Teaching\u000a      Recovery Techniques programme (TRT) and twenty school counsellors in\u000a      Nablus have received the novel Listening Skills for Crisis intervention\u000a      programme (C1 &amp; C5). The Centre for Applied Research in Ramallah has\u000a      been monitoring the gains for counsellors over time. Benefits reported by\u000a      counsellors include: increased knowledge and recognition of the nature of\u000a      children's trauma, increased skills in listening and in the delivery of\u000a      trauma recovery programmes and increased confidence in responding to\u000a      traumatic events. School counsellors also report increased networking\u000a      between counsellors and increased confidence in practice from access to\u000a      external international expert consultation (C5).\u000a    As a direct consequence of the research involving counsellor training,\u000a      5000 children have received the HTCH programme in Gaza and 1000 children\u000a      have received the TRT programme in the West Bank. This has lead to\u000a      substantial reductions in the rates of children meeting the criteria for\u000a      post traumatic stress disorder (down by 25%), depression (down by 50%),\u000a      traumatic grief (down by 30%) and other mental health concerns (down by\u000a      25%). In addition, children's motivation and concentration in school has\u000a      significantly increased (20% gains). By the end of the rolling programme\u000a      of training and programme delivery in Palestine more than 1 million\u000a      children will have benefitted from this initiative (C3, C4, C5).\u000a    Assessment of children's subjective experience of programme delivery has\u000a      led to longer term programmes and greater parental engagement and\u000a      involvement. The research into children's views has resulted in the\u000a      development of trauma-informed seminars delivered to teachers, parents and\u000a      school principals. Five trauma awareness raising seminars have been\u000a      delivered in Jericho to over 200 teachers, parents and school principals.\u000a      Focus group evaluation of school staff and parental experience indicates a\u000a      range of benefits: attitudinal shifts for teachers, head teachers and\u000a      parents in being better able to recognise challenging behaviour as\u000a      communication of traumatic stress; knowledge gains in understanding the\u000a      neurobiology of trauma, skill gains in supporting traumatised children and\u000a      emotional gains in feeling more confident in their handling of their\u000a      children.

Directly as a result of the Dundee research, this policy\u000a      incorporates a human rights lens on children's traumatic experience;\u000a      challenges the cultural stigma of mental illness; sets childhood trauma\u000a      within wider public health concerns (e.g. unemployment and poverty,\u000a      sanitation, medical services, utilities and domestic violence); identifies\u000a      the nature and extent of traumatic exposure and resultant wide ranging\u000a      symptoms; ensures key support adults' trauma is addressed; and embeds\u000a      effective trauma recovery programmes into the school curriculum (C1 &amp;\u000a      C2). The research has also contributed to increased economic capital for\u000a      CARE, the non-governmental organisation responsible for coordinating the\u000a      delivery of trauma recovery programmes throughout Palestine (&#163;100,000).\u000a      This funding has come through related trauma recovery projects (C5).\u000a    The Dundee research has led to the application of trauma recovery\u000a      programmes and the battery of measures to be developed into other conflict\u000a      situations around the World. In Jordan and Egypt, CARE has delivered\u000a      trauma recovery programmes to over 200 child refugees. In Scotland, for\u000a      the first time, the research has led to the delivery of group trauma\u000a      recovery programmes within Scotland's Secure Estate. The two main secure\u000a      accommodation services, Rossie and Kibble are now able to provide trauma\u000a      recovery programmes to over one hundred children who are at risk of\u000a      suicide and\/or harm to others (C3, C4, C6, C7).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by the UoA has transformed trauma recovery for children in\u000a      situations of on-going violence.

For the first time, research identified and quantified the\u000a      different types of traumatic events children experience under military\u000a      occupation in Palestine. Assessment of the consequences of these traumatic\u000a      events included the development of a battery of screening measures\u000a      covering the extent and nature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\u000a      depression, traumatic grief and the impact of trauma on familial\/peer\u000a      relationships and children's school performance (Barron, Abdullah and\u000a      Smith, 2012).\u000a    The design of the battery of screening measures for child trauma\u000a      developed through an international partnership involving researchers at\u000a      the University of Dundee; University College London; Kings College London;\u000a      The Centre for Crisis Psychology, Bergen and the Centre for Applied\u000a      Research in Education, Ramallah. The University of Dundee provided the\u000a      core role of screening battery design, implementation and evaluation\u000a      (Barron, Abdullah and Smith, 2012). Associated research at the University\u000a      of Dundee, examining abuse\/trauma prevention across the globe led to\u000a      inclusion of screening for domestic as well as military violence (Topping\u000a      and Barron, 2009).\u000a    Research at the University of Dundee exploring inter-cultural and ethical\u000a      issues led to the adoption of a non-colonialist and empowerment framework\u000a      underpinning trauma recovery programme delivery and research design\u000a      (Barron and Abdullah, 2013). This guided the inclusion of Western and\u000a      Middle East trauma recovery programmes; set the research within a\u000a      socio-political-historical context (e.g. occupation, poverty, domestic\u000a      violence, mental illness) and sought to understand children's experiences\u000a      of trauma and programme delivery in their `own' words.\u000a    Previous associated research at the University in domestic\u000a      violence\/trauma prevention identified critical methodological gaps, i.e.\u000a      control groups and randomisation, programme fidelity and exploration of\u000a      children's subjective experience (Topping and Barron, 2009; Barron and\u000a      Topping, 2008, 2011). As these gaps were mirrored within the trauma\u000a      recovery literature this led to a mixed methods approach utilising the\u000a      gold standard of randomised control trials, the application of focus group\u000a      methodology and implementation of programme fidelity measures.\u000a    University of Dundee research that explored school counsellors' skills\u000a      underpinning effective delivery of trauma recovery programmes led to the\u000a      development of a phased model of training where counsellors are now\u000a      required to develop effective listening and helping skills prior to\u000a      training in trauma recovery specific programmes (Barron and Abdullah,\u000a      2012).\u000a    Related on-going research addresses (i) the development of a screening\u000a      battery to include a measure of dissociation for complex trauma; (ii) the\u000a      nature of supervision for effective trauma recovery programme delivery;\u000a      (iii) evaluation of teachers', parents' and school principals' perceptions\u000a      of trauma seminars in Palestinian Schools and (iv) the identification and\u000a      amelioration of complex trauma in young people in Scotland's Secure\u000a      Estate.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38386","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    1. Conceptual and empirical tools that underpin the study\u000d\u000a          of contemporary slavery.\u000d\u000a    Bales' research insights conceptualizing and measuring contemporary\u000d\u000a      slavery have entered the\u000d\u000a      public consciousness. A web search on `27 million slaves' generates around\u000d\u000a      400,000 responses;\u000d\u000a      the same phrase in a Google Books search yields 2,500 titles. A specific\u000d\u000a      impact of these insights\u000d\u000a      was demonstrated by President Clinton's closing speech to the 2008 Clinton\u000d\u000a      Global Initiative,\u000d\u000a      announcing that modern slavery would become an area of concentration for\u000d\u000a      the Initiative. Holding\u000d\u000a      it aloft, Clinton went on: \"This is a book by Kevin Bales, it's called\u000d\u000a      Ending Slavery: How We Free\u000d\u000a      Today's Slaves and he points out that there are 27 million people in the\u000d\u000a      world...it tells you that it's\u000d\u000a      a problem we can solve and...how to do it.\" In 2013, Bill Gates called the\u000d\u000a      Global Slavery Index an\u000d\u000a      `important tool to let governments, NGOs and business take stock and take\u000d\u000a      action against this\u000d\u000a      terrible problem.'\u000d\u000a    2. Research insights supporting legal, policy, and\u000d\u000a          legislative activities.\u000d\u000a    Legal: Examples include research insights into the role of\u000d\u000a      the rule of law in addressing\u000d\u000a      contemporary slavery. Partner organizations collaborating in research on\u000d\u000a      direct intervention in\u000d\u000a      India accomplished 176 prosecutions of slaveholders between 2009 and 2012,\u000d\u000a      with 1,223 slaves\u000d\u000a      freed. Direct liberation work in India was paralleled by prevention\u000d\u000a      projects in which 46,000 villagers\u000d\u000a      were reached with human trafficking prevention education. A partner\u000d\u000a      organization in Brazil\u000d\u000a      liberated 1,027 enslaved workers through legal processes in 2008-2011. In\u000d\u000a      2009 Bales' impact on\u000d\u000a      legal, policy, and legislative activities was recognised with a $60,000\u000d\u000a      Prime Mover Fellowship by\u000d\u000a      the Hunt Alternatives Fund. These are given to individuals who `act to\u000d\u000a      change policies, cultural\u000d\u000a      behavior, or social inequities'.\u000d\u000a    Policy: In 2012 Bales was commissioned to brief the\u000d\u000a      European Parliament External Policies\u000d\u000a      Department on `Addressing contemporary forms of slavery in EU external\u000d\u000a      policy'. In 2010, research\u000d\u000a      insights into the `freedom dividend' (how liberation from enslavement has\u000d\u000a      an impact on economic\u000d\u000a      and human development) directed social and economic development projects,\u000d\u000a      funded by the US\u000d\u000a      State Department, for communities held in slavery as they progressed\u000d\u000a      through liberation and\u000d\u000a      reintegration. The State Department commissioned independent evaluation\u000d\u000a      that noted that these\u000d\u000a      insights provided `an exceptionally strong model that appears to be having\u000d\u000a      a significant impact on\u000d\u000a      the population of focus &#8212; not only in terms of the numbers of individuals\u000d\u000a      with whom they are able to\u000d\u000a      work, but more importantly, because their model appears sustainable.'\u000d\u000a      After this evaluation the\u000d\u000a      State Department chose this approach as a best practice example of\u000d\u000a      measurable impact and\u000d\u000a      methodology. A second policy example is the application of Bales' `slavery\u000d\u000a      lens' concept within\u000d\u000a      development programs. In 2010, supported by the World Bank, 241 social\u000d\u000a      mobilizers were trained\u000d\u000a      in the `slavery lens' methodology. The impact of this technique was then\u000d\u000a      evaluated by UK-DfID,\u000d\u000a      reporting it `helped people in the community to enhance themselves with\u000d\u000a      right information and\u000d\u000a      helped to protect them from the risk of slavery and trafficking during\u000d\u000a      foreign migration'. Following\u000d\u000a      this measurement of impact, the technique was scaled-up to over a million\u000d\u000a      households that are\u000d\u000a      highly vulnerable to unsafe migration. (Swiss and Finnish funding)\u000d\u000a    Legislative: In 2008 Bales' `slavery lens' concept was\u000d\u000a      included in the Trafficking Victims Protection\u000d\u000a      Act Reauthorization, requiring its use in directing US overseas aid;\u000d\u000a      alterations were also made to\u000d\u000a      US visa rules, both areas of investigation and recommendation in `The\u000d\u000a      Slave Next Door'. In 2009\u000d\u000a      the Congress increased funding for anti-slavery work, again following\u000d\u000a      recommendations in Ending\u000d\u000a      Slavery. Bales helped draft the California Transparency in Supply Chains\u000d\u000a      Act of 2010 (into force\u000d\u000a      2012), a version of which is now (2013) before Parliament with cross-party\u000d\u000a      support as the\u000d\u000a      Transparency in Supply Chains Bill. In 2011-13 Bales was Special Advisor\u000d\u000a      to the UK government's\u000d\u000a      Slavery and Human Trafficking Review, re-writing laws and policies on\u000d\u000a      contemporary slavery.\u000d\u000a    3.

Working together with the chocolate industry, anti-slavery\u000d\u000a      groups, consumers\u000d\u000a      groups, and trade unions, more than $20 million has been transferred into\u000d\u000a      anti-slavery work in\u000d\u000a      cocoa-growing regions since 2008 through the International Cocoa\u000d\u000a      Initiative (ICI), which Bales\u000d\u000a      helped to found and serves as a member of the Executive Committee.\u000d\u000a      Additionally, Bales was\u000d\u000a      asked in 2011 by WalMart, the world's largest retail firm, to help build\u000d\u000a      system-wide supply chain\u000d\u000a      inspection and a training package for their supplier companies &#8212; activity\u000d\u000a      generated by the coming\u000d\u000a      to force of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act in 2012.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Universities UK named Bales' work as one of `100 Discoveries in UK\u000d\u000a      Universities that have\u000d\u000a      Changed the World.' Bales, they said, `brought about a new awareness, new\u000d\u000a      laws and new\u000d\u000a      programmes for the liberation and rehabilitation of slaves around the\u000d\u000a      world.'

The Act now guides practice with all vulnerable adults in\u000a      Scotland. The outcome\u000a      of the research is therefore reflected in the subsequent Act and the work\u000a      of the Implementation\u000a      Committee of which he was also a member. This Committee was established to\u000a      ensure continual\u000a      engagement with stakeholders during the implementation of the Act.\u000a      Membership of the group\u000a      included representatives from regulatory bodies, local authorities, NHS\u000a      Boards, police and a\u000a      number of voluntary organisations. After the Act was passed, it was agreed\u000a      that the group should\u000a      continue through the implementation period in recognition of its much\u000a      valued role in informing the\u000a      work of the Government. Members represent the views of their organisation\u000a      and report back to\u000a      their organisations, as appropriate, the outcome of discussions held at\u000a      the meetings. Throughout\u000a      this process the principal investigator contributed to the development and\u000a      implementation of the\u000a      Act (C2, C3, C4).\u000a    In the light of the findings, and at the instigation of the Scottish\u000a      Government, a resource for self-evaluation\u000a      of multi-agency ASP activity was developed by Professor Hogg in discussion\u000a      with a\u000a      wide range of agencies, including the Social Work Inspection Agency, the\u000a      Scottish Government,\u000a      and ASP multi-agency partnerships. Two national conferences of\u000a      stakeholders were held on the\u000a      ASP resource, in Perth in 2010 and Glasgow in 2011. The outcome was a\u000a      resource handbook\u000a      which has been piloted in 14 ASP Partnerships (50%) in Scotland and\u000a      revised in the light of\u000a      feedback. The evaluation of the Resource indicated that seven ASP\u000a      partnerships had changed\u000a      their practice as a result of shortcomings revealed through\u000a      self-evaluation (see Hogg &amp; May 2012,\u000a      p.183).\u000a    The chair of the National Adult Protection Committee Convenors Committee\u000a      has subsequently\u000a      recommended adoption of the resource as a benchmarking tool for reporting\u000a      to the Scottish\u000a      Government.

The resource has\u000a      been published on the Scottish Government's website. In 2010 13 of the 29\u000a      Adult Protection\u000a      Committees in Scotland had undertaken self-evaluation and audit activity\u000a      of their work, mostly\u000a      using the approach developed in Dundee. In 2012 all but one of the 29\u000a      Adult Protection\u000a      Committees had undertaken self-evaluation and case file audits (C1, C6).\u000a    The invasive procedures research led to the establishment of a Short-Life\u000a      Working Group which\u000a      developed a Scottish quality framework for the delivery of invasive\u000a      procedures in health, education\u000a      and social care setting. The recently launched strategy for improving the\u000a      quality of life for people\u000a      with learning disabilities is recommending that all service providers\u000a      follow these guidelines (C5).\u000a      The current impact has been on policy development and initial\u000a      implementation.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research within the UoA influenced national policy developments,\u000a      implementation, and practice\u000a      guidelines regarding protecting\/supporting vulnerable adults.

The\u000a      study examined the agency and interagency working in adult protection\u000a      cases, provided a baseline\u000a      to compare such activity before and after implementation of the Act, and\u000a      provided the groundwork\u000a      for future audit in such cases after implementation of the Act. The study\u000a      utilised a multiple\u000a      methods, in-depth case study approach. Each case study (n=23) involved\u000a      documentary analysis of\u000a      service user\/patient files (primarily social work), followed by\u000a      semi-structured interviews with all\u000a      involved professionals. Detailed chronologies were then compiled of events\u000a      and interactions over\u000a      the course of each case, supplemented by professionals' explanations and\u000a      reflections on the\u000a      process of response. This information was synthesised in a tabular\u000a      chronology with agency and\u000a      interagency communication and activity coded and organised into key\u000a      themes. This research\u000a      highlighted that occupational cultures affected adult protection activity,\u000a      how cases were\u000a      conceptualised or framed as adult protection cases or otherwise impacted\u000a      response, and\u000a      operational considerations impacted adult support and protection.\u000a    The second area of research (Hogg &amp; May, 2012 &amp; 2011) followed on\u000a      directly from the research\u000a      outlined above. A self-evaluation resource for adult support and\u000a      protection activities was developed\u000a      and pilot tested in 15 of the 28 multi-agency partnerships across\u000a      Scotland. This research used a\u000a      survey methodology of all pilot sites. The utility of the resource was\u000a      demonstrated as a mechanism\u000a      for enabling multi-agency partnerships to evaluate the effectiveness of\u000a      their own policy and\u000a      practice and as a benchmarking resource.\u000a    The third area of research focused on health care procedures viewed as\u000a      invasive by the family\u000a      members and paid carers of people with profound and multiple learning\u000a      disabilities. Specifically the\u000a      research aimed to establish the extent to which barriers exist which\u000a      precluded the delivery of such\u000a      procedures in service settings and what these barriers were. The research\u000a      identified ways in which\u000a      barriers may be overcome and described examples of good practice in which\u000a      barriers have been\u000a      overcome. The research consisted of three components:\u000a    \u000a      Symposium &#8212; A review by experts of evidence and workshops with\u000a        practitioners to elicit\u000a        their views;\u000a      A national survey of policy and practice in Scotland with respect to\u000a        delivering invasive\u000a        procedures in educational, health and social care facilities;\u000a      Synthesis of information by an expert committee and a national\u000a        reference group.\u000a    \u000a    The results identified healthcare procedures judged by professionals and\u000a      family carers as\u000a      \"invasive\" and examined barriers to their delivery in service settings.\u000a      Practice guidelines were\u000a      developed based on the research and have been included in the Scottish\u000a      Government's strategy\u000a      for improving the lives of people with learning disabilities.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38402","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The publication of an Action Plan (SCIE, 2008) (See Reference 2 above)\u000d\u000a      based on the research findings showed that those funding the research were\u000d\u000a      serious about implementing the research recommendations.

The annual\u000d\u000a        conferences embody this commitment and are an opportunity for users and\u000d\u000a        carers to hold RQIA, NISCC and SCIE to account, reflect on progress and\u000d\u000a        share learning\" (From Reference 3): Duffy and Mc Keever (2012:112)\u000d\u000a    All three organisations have now changed their policies and working\u000d\u000a      practices on user engagement and public participation as a result of this\u000d\u000a      research. Specific examples are as follows:\u000d\u000a    Example 1. Since the research was published in 2008, an annual User\u000d\u000a      Involvement Conference funded and organised by the three commissioning\u000d\u000a      organisations now takes place. This conference is jointly organised with\u000d\u000a      service user representatives and is a direct response to the research\u000d\u000a      recommendation that health and social care service providers need to more\u000d\u000a      actively engage and communicate with the public in Northern Ireland. The\u000d\u000a      most recent conference was opened and endorsed by the Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      Health Minister (Mr Edwin Poots). As a reflection of this event's impact\u000d\u000a      and importance, the Patient and Client Council in Northern Ireland, the\u000d\u000a      watchdog organisation for service users' issues, have now committed to\u000d\u000a      leading on the organisation of the 2013 conference. The conference\u000d\u000a      routinely involves presentations by service users about their experiences\u000d\u000a      of receiving services and always includes opportunities for a `question\u000d\u000a      time' panel debate with senior managers from the health and social care\u000d\u000a      sector through which service users can directly interface with and\u000d\u000a      challenge service providers.\u000d\u000a    Example 2. User involvement practices are now firmly embedded in the\u000d\u000a      working practices of RQIA. Patient Experience Reviews now\u000d\u000a      routinely take place before inspections; service user views on the\u000d\u000a      experiences of Guardianship are also sought and care experienced young\u000d\u000a      people with a learning disability are involved in inspections of\u000d\u000a      residential care facilities. The following quote from RQIA further\u000d\u000a      highlights the impact of this research: \"This research has been a\u000d\u000a        catalyst for us to ensure that we put service users and carers at the\u000d\u000a        heart of what we do in all our regulation, inspection and review\u000d\u000a        activities and by ensuring the voice of the user is reflected we can\u000d\u000a        qualitatively reflect their experience to those who care for them or\u000d\u000a        provide them with a service. We have seen tremendous evidence of real\u000d\u000a        and meaningful and enhanced service improvements particularly on long\u000d\u000a        stay mental health and learning disability wards\".\u000d\u000a    Example 3.

O ne piece of research, commissioned by the Social Care Institute\u000d\u000a      for Excellence, London, on behalf of the Regulation and Quality\u000d\u000a      Improvement Authority (RQIA), and the Northern Ireland Social Care Council\u000d\u000a      (NISCC) was awarded to Mr Joe Duffy (Lecturer in Social Work) after a\u000d\u000a      competitive peer review process.\u000d\u000a    The research team led by Duffy (Principal Investigator) consisted of\u000d\u000a      academic and service user\/peer researchers. The key purpose of this\u000d\u000a      research was to recommend ways in which user involvement in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland could be strengthened. The organisations providing the &#163;14k\u000d\u000a      funding for the research were keen to be presented with a range of options\u000d\u000a      for the further inclusion and participation of users in their work. They\u000d\u000a      were also requesting a focus on the strategic development of user\u000d\u000a      involvement in Northern Ireland more broadly (See Reference 1) A\u000d\u000a      significant aspect of this research was that it was undertaken jointly by\u000d\u000a      a team consisting of academic and service user\/peer researchers. All key\u000d\u000a      aspects of the research process were therefore jointly organised by\u000d\u000a      academics and service user researchers applying different elements of\u000d\u000a      their expertise. In this way there was a true spirit of collaboration to\u000d\u000a      the research approach where team members could learn from each other's\u000d\u000a      experience. Service user researchers were therefore fully involved in the\u000d\u000a      interviews, data analysis, report writing and development of conclusions\u000d\u000a      and recommendations (See Reference 3) The research used a multi-method\u000d\u000a      approach to data collection, combining desk-based research and interviews\u000d\u000a      with 148 people from a range of service user and carer groups across\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland. Our review of the literature indicated that more\u000d\u000a      attempts needed to be made by researchers and policy makers to include the\u000d\u000a      views of groups and individuals experiencing social exclusion and\u000d\u000a      marginalisation. Our research therefore took particular care to ensure\u000d\u000a      that `seldom heard' user groups were consulted. The research made a total\u000d\u000a      of eight key recommendations (See Reference 1). Several of these related\u000d\u000a      to issues such as improvements in staff training and awareness, the need\u000d\u000a      for key staff being identified for implementing user issues and the need\u000d\u000a      for senior management to take strategic responsibility for directing and\u000d\u000a      implementing policies and practices on user involvement.\u000d\u000a    One recommendation, in particular, relates significantly to the impact in\u000d\u000a      this case study. The research highlighted that the three organisations\u000d\u000a      commissioning the research needed to clearly and actively communicate\u000d\u000a      their roles and responsibilities to service users and carers involved in\u000d\u000a      their work and also in the wider community.\u000d\u000a    The majority of respondents surveyed in this research had indicated that\u000d\u000a      they had encountered serious difficulties in how the health and social\u000d\u000a      services organisations communicated with them. This recommendation was in\u000d\u000a      direct response to this issue.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38403","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Impact on user involvement\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The early research helped secure government funding in the late 1990s for\u000d\u000a      two voluntary sector\u000d\u000a      organisations promoting the needs of care-experienced young people: Voice\u000d\u000a      of Young People in\u000d\u000a      Care (VOYPIC) and First Key (NI).

This was\u000d\u000a      not just an `academic'\u000d\u000a      change, but one with implications for service development. For example,\u000d\u000a      Pinkerton's pioneering\u000d\u000a      1996 study documented the poor outcomes of care leavers in NI, including\u000d\u000a      their low rates of\u000d\u000a      educational achievement, housing insecurity, unemployment and early\u000d\u000a      parenthood. The study\u000d\u000a      introduced concepts such as `care career' and `outcomes', encouraging\u000d\u000a      policy makers and service\u000d\u000a      makers to think about the `whole system' and the impact of service\u000d\u000a      provision across the child's\u000d\u000a      lifetime in care, and beyond.\u000d\u000a    Together with later research on the needs, care experiences and outcomes\u000d\u000a      of looked after children\u000d\u000a      (Reference 6) research at Queen's reinforced for policy makers the\u000d\u000a      importance of understanding\u000d\u000a      the individual needs of children in care within the complex social and\u000d\u000a      emotional worlds of their\u000d\u000a      placements.\u000d\u000a    `The care population and the population of children on the edge of care\u000d\u000a      is not a\u000d\u000a      homogeneous group but in fact consists of different smaller groups with\u000d\u000a      differing needs for\u000d\u000a      whom a variety of services need to be available.'

Queen's research on children in care therefore makes its\u000d\u000a      impact as part of a\u000d\u000a      regional child welfare system into which it is well embedded, as the\u000d\u000a      following quotes illustrate:\u000d\u000a    `The Queen's work on adoption provided the regional underpinning to the\u000d\u000a      policy direction\u000d\u000a      agreed for adoption (Adopting the Future) which we hope will legislated\u000d\u000a      for next year'\u000d\u000a      DHSSPS (Adoption Lead)\u000d\u000a    The international engagement with other policy centres led to Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland policy makers being\u000d\u000a      introduced to research by Chapin Hall (University of Chicago),\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the benefits of\u000d\u000a      extending support to care leavers beyond the age of 18. This, combined\u000d\u000a      with Pinkerton's work on\u000d\u000a      care leavers in NI, resulted in the Northern Ireland government committing\u000d\u000a      to funding the GEM\u000d\u000a      (Going the Extra Mile) Scheme (piloted 2006, formally launched 2010).\u000d\u000a    `The work at Queen's has been a crucial part of developing the evidence\u000d\u000a      informed leaving\u000d\u000a      care policy and practice we are striving for.

An article by Pinkerton, explaining this perspective on leaving\u000d\u000a      care, was included in an\u000d\u000a      issue of Development and Transition, a journal published by the\u000d\u000a      United Nations Development\u000d\u000a      Programme\/London School of Economics and Political Science.

The first of\u000d\u000a      these now chairs a project in Brasov which uses the concept of the `care\u000d\u000a      career' and conceptual\u000d\u000a      tools developed by Pinkerton to inform its work. The tools include the\u000d\u000a      `leaving care coping wheel':\u000d\u000a      this provides practitioners and service designers with a useful, visual,\u000d\u000a      representation of everything\u000d\u000a      that needs to be in place to address the needs of care leavers (e.g.\u000d\u000a      guidance and support, practical\u000d\u000a      and social skills), and the importance of linked support from a number of\u000d\u000a      agencies. Another project\u000d\u000a      in Cape Town, initially aiming to provide a residential aftercare service\u000d\u000a      chose instead to develop a\u000d\u000a      mentoring project on Pinkerton's advice. The work of the Ghanaian PhD\u000d\u000a      graduate (Frimpong\u000d\u000a      Manso) has been used to demonstrate `promising practice' for promoting the\u000d\u000a      2009 UN Guidelines\u000d\u000a      on Out of Home Care.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    For the most part, looked-after children have poorer physical and mental\u000d\u000a      health than other children,\u000d\u000a      and do less well educationally.

The study also suggested a marked increase in the use of\u000d\u000a      adoption (Reference 7).\u000d\u000a    Phase 2 (2003-06) examined children's progress from the\u000d\u000a      perspectives of parents or foster carers\u000d\u000a      (depending on where they were then placed), and how parents\/carers were\u000d\u000a      themselves coping.\u000d\u000a      Findings indicated that adopted children were doing marginally better than\u000d\u000a      children in long-term\u000d\u000a      foster care, with both groups faring markedly better than those returned\u000d\u000a      home.\u000d\u000a    Phase 3 (2007-10) explored the experience of care from the\u000d\u000a      children's perspectives. Placement\u000d\u000a      stability was found to be more important than placement type.\u000d\u000a      Surprisingly, the health profile for\u000d\u000a      adopted children was poorer than that of children in other long-term\u000d\u000a      placements (Reference 8).\u000d\u000a    Supported Accommodation &#8212; Service Review (2010, consultant\u000d\u000a      Pinkerton) Unpublished internal\u000d\u000a      review of a successful, interagency high support service showing need for\u000d\u000a      further attention to\u000d\u000a      integrating voluntary sector provision within statutory sector systems.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38404","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Correspondence from the Department of Justice NI stated that the research\u000d\u000a      would assist criminal justice agencies and their voluntary sector partners\u000d\u000a      in the development of a new five year strategy for victims and witnesses\u000d\u000a      of crime. The Department subsequently made a commitment in the victim and\u000d\u000a      witness annual action plan 2011-12 (Department of Justice NI, 2011) to\u000d\u000a      consider the recommendations of the research when developing this new five\u000d\u000a      year strategy (see below). In November 2011 Hayes was invited to present\u000d\u000a      the findings of the research at a joint NSPCC and Victim Support NI\u000d\u000a      seminar on `Victims' Voices: Experiences of Children and Adults of the\u000d\u000a      Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland'. The seminar was addressed by\u000d\u000a      the minister for Justice and attended by senior representatives from a\u000d\u000a      number of criminal justice agencies, the judiciary, legal professionals,\u000d\u000a      the voluntary sector as well as representatives from the Department of\u000d\u000a      Justice NI and the NI Assembly's Justice Committee.\u000d\u000a    In February 2012 Hayes and Bunting (NSPCC) were invited to contribute to\u000d\u000a      a Criminal Justice Issues Group (CJIG) workshop on victims and witnesses\u000d\u000a      of crime. The CJIG is an advisory body on operational issues impacting on\u000d\u000a      the criminal justice system and comprises representatives from the\u000d\u000a      judiciary, criminal justice agencies, legal professions and the voluntary\u000d\u000a      sector. The workshop focused on three key areas (waiting times at court,\u000d\u000a      victim participation in proceedings, and special measures) which were all\u000d\u000a      issues that the research had highlighted in relation to young witnesses in\u000d\u000a      criminal proceedings. In February 2012 Hayes was also invited to act as a\u000d\u000a      consultant on a European Union Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) project\u000d\u000a      which is examining the involvement of children and young people in justice\u000d\u000a      proceedings (criminal and civil) in 10 EU member states. This has involved\u000d\u000a      reviewing research materials, attending an `experts' meeting at the FRA in\u000d\u000a      Vienna to provide advice on appropriate methodologies and ethical issues,\u000d\u000a      and an on-going role reviewing materials, draft reports, etc. Hayes also\u000d\u000a      presented the research findings at the 8th Congress of the\u000d\u000a      British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and\u000d\u000a      Neglect (BASPCAN) held at Queen's University Belfast in April 2012.\u000d\u000a    The research findings have influenced the work of two reviews into\u000d\u000a      victims and witnesses of crime which have also fed into the development of\u000d\u000a      the five year strategy mentioned above. The first of these was an\u000d\u000a      inspection of the use of special measures in the criminal justice system\u000d\u000a      in Northern Ireland and their effectiveness in achieving best outcomes for\u000d\u000a      witnesses (Criminal Justice Inspection NI, 2012). The research findings\u000d\u000a      are cited within the inspection report and the lead inspector has\u000d\u000a      confirmed that they were instructive and valuable in that they provided a\u000d\u000a      frame of reference for significant areas of the inspection, underpinned\u000d\u000a      and supported the inspection findings, and broadly assisted in the\u000d\u000a      assessments which led to the strategic recommendation of a Witness Charter\u000d\u000a      for N.I. This is based on analogous findings that the rights of criminal\u000d\u000a      justice system users (both children\/young people and adults) were often\u000d\u000a      not fully communicated or understood and the concomitant need to codify\u000d\u000a      same in a Charter. Finally, he acknowledged that the research had\u000d\u000a      supported many of the inspection's operational recommendations such as the\u000d\u000a      need for a clear expression in PSNI policy of the need to discuss special\u000d\u000a      measures and complete an individual needs assessment, the need to ensure a\u000d\u000a      clear, comprehensive and auditable system of updates for witnesses\u000d\u000a      regarding the process of special measures applications, and the\u000d\u000a      development of a criminal justice system wide leaflet which clearly sets\u000d\u000a      out for witnesses the kind of support available to them and the\u000d\u000a      organisations who provide it.\u000d\u000a    The second was an inquiry into the criminal justice services available to\u000d\u000a      victims and witnesses of crime in Northern Ireland (NI Assembly Committee\u000d\u000a      for Justice, 2012). The research was cited in the inquiry report and\u000d\u000a      quoted extensively in two NI Assembly Research and Information Service\u000d\u000a      papers which informed the inquiry (O'Connell and Mulvenna, 2011;\u000d\u000a      O'Connell, 2011). The research was also cited extensively in the NSPCC's\u000d\u000a      evidence to the inquiry, both written (NSPCC, 2011) and oral (http:\/\/www.niassembly.gov.uk\/Documents\/Official-Reports\/Justice\/2011-2012\/InquiryintoCriminalJusticeServices.pdf).\u000d\u000a    Correspondence from the Chair of the NI Assembly's Committee for Justice\u000d\u000a      stated that \"The Committee found it particularly useful that research\u000d\u000a      based evidence relating specifically to the experiences of children and\u000d\u000a      young people was available to inform its consideration of the issues and\u000d\u000a      in reaching the Inquiry findings and recommendations.\" He particularly\u000d\u000a      acknowledged the impact of the research on a number of the inquiry's\u000d\u000a      recommendations including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The introduction of a Victim and Witness Charter providing statutory\u000d\u000a        entitlements in terms of information provision and treatment;\u000d\u000a      The introduction of a comprehensive formal assessment process to\u000d\u000a        identify the needs of individual victims and witnesses in relation to\u000d\u000a        special measures and other support requirements at the earliest stage;\u000d\u000a      The provision of resources for practical support services including\u000d\u000a        trauma counselling;\u000d\u000a      An evaluation of the facilities currently provided for victims and\u000d\u000a        witnesses in all courts;\u000d\u000a      The introduction of a maximum waiting time for victims and witnesses;\u000d\u000a      The use of specialised courts to prioritise cases involving children\u000d\u000a        and young people;\u000d\u000a      Placing case management on a statutory footing in order to address the\u000d\u000a        issue of delay.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The new five year strategy for victims and witnesses of crime was issued\u000d\u000a      for consultation in October 2012 (Department of Justice NI, 2012) and\u000d\u000a      specifically acknowledges the research as one of the influences on its\u000d\u000a      development.

The final version of the strategy was\u000d\u000a      launched in June 2013.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The last three decades have witnessed considerable interest in the\u000d\u000a      position of children and young people acting as witnesses in criminal\u000d\u000a      cases and on how best to facilitate them to give their best evidence and\u000d\u000a      minimise the trauma involved. Governments in England, Wales and Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland have introduced a raft of policies and procedures in order to\u000d\u000a      ensure that young witnesses are able to give their best evidence and\u000d\u000a      receive the support they need. Despite these efforts, however, research\u000d\u000a      conducted by Plotnikoff and Woolfson (2004; 2009) in England, Wales and\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland demonstrated a continuing gap between policy and the\u000d\u000a      practice reality of many children's experiences of giving evidence in\u000d\u000a      criminal courts. The small number of Northern Ireland interviews in these\u000d\u000a      studies, however, and evidence of on-going difficulties experienced by\u000d\u000a      young witnesses, pointed to the need for additional research in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland to explore the issues further and inform policy and practice in\u000d\u000a      this jurisdiction. The Department of Justice (NI), therefore, commissioned\u000d\u000a      a research team with members from the School of Sociology, Social Policy\u000d\u000a      and Social Work, Queen's University Belfast and the NSPCC (Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland) to undertake research into the views and experiences of young\u000d\u000a      witnesses giving evidence in criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a      This research is presented as an example of impact because its\u000d\u000a      recommendations have influenced the work of two major reviews into the\u000d\u000a      services provided to victims and witnesses of crime in Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      and, subsequently, the new five year draft strategy for victims and\u000d\u000a      witnesses of crime.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Queen's University Belfast\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen's University Belfast","InstitutionName":"Queen's University Belfast","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10005343}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2761369","Name":"Vienna"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aBunting, L.

Hayes\u000d\u000a      has a long-standing practice and research interest in the investigation of\u000d\u000a      child abuse allegations by both police officers (Hayes and McCullough,\u000d\u000a      2001) and social workers (Hayes and Spratt, 2012), as has Bunting in child\u000d\u000a      victims in the criminal justice system (Bunting, 2008; 2013).

This evidence was informed by the research on the\u000a      process of reviewing non-accidental child deaths, cited in the evidence\u000a      presented to the Committee (Sources 1 &amp; 5).\u000a    During 2010-2011 the DHSSPS invited Devaney to be part of the\u000a      reference group developing statutory regulations to underpin new\u000a      legislation on the establishment of the SBNI. The research findings\u000a      informed these statutory regulations in respect of improving the\u000a      governance and operation of the CMR process. (Source 1)\u000a    In November 2010 Devaney and Lazenbatt were invited by\u000a      the Scottish Government to address a conference of policy makers and\u000a      senior managers looking at ways of improving the system for reviewing\u000a      non-accidental child deaths in Scotland. Devaney was also asked by\u000a      the Welsh Assembly Government to sit on the Advisory Group for the Welsh\u000a      Overview of Serious Case Reviews (2010-2011), and by the Department of\u000a      Education in London to sit on the Advisory Group for the Biennial Review\u000a      of SCRs (2011-2012). In March 2011 Devaney and the Chief Social\u000a      Services Officer for Northern Ireland attended a meeting in the Department\u000a      of Education (London) to brief Professor Eileen Munro on developments in\u000a      the CMR process in Northern Ireland as part of the Munro Review on Child\u000a      Protection in England. (Source 1).\u000a    The Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland have now enacted several of\u000a      the key recommendations from the first report (References 1 &amp; 2)\u000a      in relation to revising and strengthening the CMR process, such as a more\u000a      robust process for the recruitment and selection of independent chairs of\u000a      reviews, a programme of training for individuals involved in the review\u000a      process, standardised templates for reports and stronger governance\u000a      processes for ensuring that recommendations and learning are implemented (Source\u000a      2).\u000a    In March 2013 the Children's Commissioner presented the `Still\u000a      Vulnerable' report to the Committee for the First Minister and Deputy\u000a      First Minister at the Northern Ireland Assembly in evidence before the\u000a      inquiry into a children's strategy (Sources 3 &amp; 6). The report\u000a      and its conclusions have challenged established thinking about the\u000a      separation of strategies looking at children's emotional and psychological\u000a      well being from the strategies looking at adults.\u000a    Impact on Professional Practice\u000a    The research reported has improved the effectiveness of workplace\u000a      practices. For example, the research team were asked by DHSSPS to work\u000a      with the statutory Children's Improvement Board in Northern Ireland on\u000a      developing actuarial tools to support the assessments by social workers of\u000a      the range of adversities experienced by children. This work is\u000a      strengthening the comprehensiveness of the assessment leading to more\u000a      robust plans for supporting and protecting children. Additionally, CAMHS\u000a      services are now being delivered to young people in care in their\u000a      residential units (Sources 1 &amp; 3).\u000a    In addition during 2012-2013 Devaney and Hayes were\u000a      commissioned by DHSSPS to deliver training to over 1000 professional staff\u000a      (social workers, health visitors, police officers, paediatricians,\u000a      midwives, mental health professionals, teachers) through a series of ten\u000a      Continuing Professional Development seminars in Northern Ireland on the\u000a      key learning arising from this work on child deaths. This training has now\u000a      been developed into a training resource for cascade training to more\u000a      professionals. (Sources 1 &amp; 2).\u000a    Impact on General Public\u000a    The research has shaped the public and political debate by challenging\u000a      the way that child abuse deaths are represented in the media. In 2011 the\u000a      British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and\u000a      Neglect, the NSPCC, the Northern Ireland Association of Social Workers and\u000a      the National Union of Journalists involved Devaney in taking\u000a      forward a further recommendation from the research relating to promoting\u000a      communication with the local community and media to raise awareness of the\u000a      positive and `helping' work of statutory services with children, so that\u000a      attention is not focused disproportionately on case management review\u000a      tragedies. This has resulted in the development of jointly produced and\u000a      endorsed guidance by the National Union of Journalists and the Department\u000a      of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on the media reporting of\u000a      child abuse and non-accidental child deaths. This was launched by the\u000a      Minister for Health on 29th November 2012 (http:\/\/www.baspcan.org.uk\/northernireland\/).\u000a      (Sources 1, 2 &amp; 4).\u000a    Subsequently Devaney was commissioned by the leading daily\u000a      Northern Ireland newspaper The Belfast Telegraph to write opinion\u000a      pieces on non-accidental child deaths, which were published on 15th April\u000a      2012 and 24th January 2013. The research team also worked with the\u000a      investigative journalism website The Detail to disseminate\u000a      findings widely (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/k4xe2fh).\u000a      This media engagement has raised public awareness of the difficult lives\u000a      some children lead.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UNICEF estimate that over 3,500 children die annually from abuse and\u000a      neglect in economically developed countries, including 100 in the UK of\u000a      whom around 4 are from Northern Ireland. Although the number of deaths\u000a      appears to be falling in the UK, the rate of decline is slowing.

Queen's has an\u000a      international reputation for research into child protection, with good\u000a      links to policy makers and agencies working with children and families.\u000a      The aim of the research in this case study was to provide an evaluation of\u000a      whether the process of reviewing the deaths or serious injury of children\u000a      could produce the type of learning that would inform the strengthening of\u000a      the child protection system and keep children safer in Northern Ireland.\u000a    Research: In 2008 the Northern Ireland Department of Health,\u000a      Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) commissioned Queen's University\u000a      and the NSPCC to undertake an evaluation of the Case Management Review\u000a      (CMR) process into non-accidental child deaths and serious child abuse\u000a      (equivalent to Serious Case Reviews [SCR] in England) (References 1\u000a        &amp; 2). The CMR process aims to develop a culture of critical\u000a      reflection, aligned with processes for system improvement and continuing\u000a      professional development in social care, health, education and criminal\u000a      justice agencies.\u000a    Lazenbatt and Devaney (Reader and Senior Lecturer\u000a      respectively at Queen's) and Bunting (Senior Researcher at NSPCC,\u000a      now at Queen's from March 2013) interviewed and surveyed senior policy\u000a      makers from a range of government departments, together with senior\u000a      managers from public services about the operation of the CMR system. The\u000a      research was concluded in January 2009. It identified key issues relating\u000a      to: the governance of the reviews; the criteria for undertaking case\u000a      management reviews; the recruitment and selection of independent\u000a      chairpersons; the preparation and support of individuals involved in the\u000a      review process; and the management of the review process.\u000a    In 2011 DHSSPS commissioned Queen's University (Devaney, Lazenbatt\u000a      and Hayes) and the NSPCC (Bunting) to produce an overview\u000a      of the learning from the first twenty-four CMRs and to identify ways in\u000a      which the learning had led to improvements in the child protection system\u000a      (Reference 3). The research was concluded in January 2013 and the\u000a      overview highlighted that families are better supported when professionals\u000a      get involved earlier before problems become entrenched, deliver better\u000a      co-ordinated interventions, and stay involved for longer to ensure that\u000a      improvements in children's lives are consolidated. The report also\u000a      highlighted that practitioners (eg social workers, health visitors, police\u000a      officers and teachers) are more effective when they receive high quality\u000a      supervision and line management support in organisations with robust\u000a      governance processes.\u000a    In 2011 the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People\u000a      commissioned Queen's University (Devaney, Lazenbatt, Hayes,\u000a      Spratt, and Davidson) and the NSPCC (Bunting) to\u000a      produce a focused report looking at the suicide or accidental death of\u000a      eight adolescents who had died as a consequence of abuse or neglect (References\u000a        4 &amp; 5). The research was concluded in 2013 and identified that\u000a      these young people had been subject to multiple forms of childhood\u000a      adversity over many years, impacting upon their psychological well-being\u000a      and capacity for resilience. The key recommendation was that professionals\u000a      needed to better understand the cumulative impact of adversity on an\u000a      individual's social and emotional well-being over the life course, rather\u000a      than focus solely on immediate risk. This would require significantly\u000a      different ways of working with troubled young people, such as developing\u000a      outreach work by Child and Adult Mental Health Services into children's\u000a      residential units which is now occurring.\u000a    Collectively the three research studies have provided a strong evidence\u000a      base for the importance of reviewing the cases where children have died or\u000a      been seriously injured as a consequence of abuse or neglect. The research\u000a      has helped policy makers in three government departments (Health,\u000a      Education and the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister)\u000a      and professionals in social care, health, mental health, criminal justice\u000a      and education to better understand the core components of an effective\u000a      child protection system in Northern Ireland, and to allow for improvements\u000a      to be instigated that will result in further reductions in the number of\u000a      children dying or being seriously injured through abuse or neglect.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38437","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Demographic trends and cultural pluralism have together raised new\u000d\u000a      challenges for end of life care\u000d\u000a      services.

Discussions are\u000d\u000a      underway to establish an end of life care `community of interest' in the\u000d\u000a      College and the ADASS\u000d\u000a      Workforce Network has invited the development of an end of life care\u000d\u000a      national workforce strategy\u000d\u000a      in social care.\u000d\u000a    The combined impact of this stream of activity has been to significantly\u000d\u000a      raise awareness in\u000d\u000a      mainstream social care of the importance of end of life care at the same\u000d\u000a      time as raising the profile\u000d\u000a      of social care amongst healthcare end of life specialists, and to promote\u000d\u000a      tangible service and\u000d\u000a      practice developments on a national scale.\u000d\u000a    Stream 2: Spiritual care at the end of life\u000d\u000a      Holloway's research on humanistic spirituality and spiritual care at the\u000d\u000a      end of life is widely known\u000d\u000a      amongst health and social care practitioners, as evidenced by numerous\u000d\u000a      invitations since 2008 to\u000d\u000a      present to mainly practitioner audiences, e.g. at 2 national conferences\u000d\u000a      of the National Council for\u000d\u000a      Palliative Care, the Making Research Count networks in York and Norwich,\u000d\u000a      the Glasgow Schools\u000d\u000a      of Social Work Public Lecture Series (also podcast), the Cheshire\u000d\u000a      Association of Hospices Annual\u000d\u000a      Lecture, conferences at St Christopher's, Princess Alice and\u000d\u000a      Leicestershire and Rutland Hospices,\u000d\u000a      and the Churches Regional Commission.\u000d\u000a    There has been significant uptake of her research findings on\u000d\u000a      spirituality amongst healthcare\u000d\u000a      professionals, hospital chaplains and parish clergy, and her `Fellow\u000d\u000a      Traveller Model' for spiritual\u000d\u000a      care is gaining increasing currency. For example, she has been asked to\u000d\u000a      assist hospices in\u000d\u000a      developing interdisciplinary models for spiritual care and is an invited\u000d\u000a      member of the European\u000d\u000a      Association for Palliative Care's symposium on Spiritual Care. A Spiritual\u000d\u000a      Care systematic literature\u000d\u000a      review was commissioned by the Department of Health in 2010 because audits\u000d\u000a      of the Liverpool\u000d\u000a      Care Pathway indicated that Standard 7 - Spiritual Care &#8212; was barely\u000d\u000a      addressed in clinical\u000d\u000a      practice. It is being widely used as the starting point for addressing the\u000d\u000a      inhibitions experienced by\u000d\u000a      practitioners, both in the UK and further afield (for example, Hospices\u000d\u000a      New Zealand has used it to\u000d\u000a      inform the development of their spiritual care guidance for practitioners\u000d\u000a      (5.6); the Interdisciplinary\u000d\u000a      Centre for Palliative Care at the University of Munich Medical School\u000d\u000a      requested and received\u000d\u000a      permission from the DH to translate into German (5.9).\u000d\u000a    Holloway's research (3.1, 3.4, 3.5) also informed the structure and\u000d\u000a      content of a 6-session module\u000d\u000a      on spirituality developed within the e-learning platform End of Life Care\u000d\u000a      for All (e-ELCA) launched\u000d\u000a      in April 2011 with 1576 active users of the module up to 31 July 2013\u000d\u000a      (5.10)\u000d\u000a    A second strand derives from the research into contemporary funerals\u000d\u000a      (3.5) with a specific focus\u000d\u000a      on the evidence for and nature of spirituality and religion within today's\u000d\u000a      personalised, reportedly\u000d\u000a      secularised, ceremonies.

Further, although the term\u000d\u000a      `holistic care' has been used\u000d\u000a      since the 1990s to claim an approach which addresses the whole person, the\u000d\u000a      concept has been\u000d\u000a      poorly defined and holistic practice often indistinguishable from\u000d\u000a      multi-disciplinary practice.\u000d\u000a    The research was undertaken from 2003 to 2011 by Margaret Holloway\u000d\u000a      (Professor of\u000d\u000a      Social Work, University of Hull, 2004 to present) with colleagues at Hull,\u000d\u000a      Sheffield, Staffordshire,\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen and Hong Kong Universities (see Section 4). Since moving to Hull,\u000d\u000a      Professor Holloway\u000d\u000a      has developed her long-standing research on death, dying and bereavement\u000d\u000a      to offer three key\u000d\u000a      insights, whose impacts are interrelated. Each has had significant impact\u000d\u000a      on end of life care &#8212; in\u000d\u000a      the UK (i) and beyond (ii and iii).\u000d\u000a    i. A focus on the end phase of life of older people and end of life\u000d\u000a        care which is not disease-specific\u000d\u000a        but proceeds from a holistic approach to assessment and care planning.\u000d\u000a      The research demonstrated that end of life care should belong to\u000d\u000a      mainstream social work and that\u000d\u000a      as people live longer but with increasing levels of frailty and\u000d\u000a      ill-health, end of life planning and care\u000d\u000a      is at the heart of personalised support for older people and people living\u000d\u000a      with long-term conditions.\u000d\u000a      The research challenges the perception that the last 2-3 days of life\u000d\u000a      constitute the dying phase\u000d\u000a      arguing that medical advances have led to a prolonged, liminal phase\u000d\u000a      before death in which social\u000d\u000a      care workers already provide high levels of support and should recognise\u000d\u000a      that this person is in the\u000d\u000a      final phase of life and may wish to make preparations for their death\u000d\u000a      (references 3.2 and 3.3)\u000d\u000a    ii. The translation of evidence of the broad range of spiritual needs\u000d\u000a        displayed by dying and\u000d\u000a        bereaved people into models of spiritual care which can be utilised by\u000d\u000a        secular professionals.\u000d\u000a      Holistic care belongs to the hospice vision and is usually claimed as the\u000d\u000a      model for end of life care.\u000d\u000a      Social work has traditionally used the term `psycho-social' care (now\u000d\u000a      adopted by other health care\u000d\u000a      professions) to describe its approach to the `whole person'. The research\u000d\u000a      highlighted the acute\u000d\u000a      neglect of existential and spiritual dimensions in supposedly `holistic\u000d\u000a      care', and considerable\u000d\u000a      reluctance in social work in particular to engage with either religious or\u000d\u000a      spiritual need (references\u000d\u000a      3.2 and 3.4).\u000d\u000a    iii. The meaning of quality end of life care in multicultural\u000d\u000a        settings, including a focus on transcultural\u000d\u000a        spirituality.\u000d\u000a      The `modern death thesis' is based to a significant degree on the\u000d\u000a      assumption that the UK is a\u000d\u000a      largely secular society. The research provided empirical evidence that\u000d\u000a      many people draw on a\u000d\u000a      range of internal and external resources in the face of death that do not\u000d\u000a      fit neatly into a\u000d\u000a      religious\/secular dichotomy. Further, it developed models which assist\u000d\u000a      those in secular professions\u000d\u000a      and workplaces, irrespective of their personal beliefs, to engage with\u000d\u000a      this dimension.

This\u000d\u000a      resource has been widely used by health and social care professionals\u000d\u000a      across South Africa since the first edition was published in 1996 (5.5;\u000d\u000a      5.6). The third edition (2010) involved substantial reworking, the\u000d\u000a      addition of much new material and a change in title to reflect a more\u000d\u000a      central emphasis on HIV\/AIDS. Pan Macmillan records indicate that from\u000d\u000a      2002, 6594 copies have been purchased across southern Africa, 3608 have\u000d\u000a      been sold since 2008 (5.3). The resource has a distinctive format,\u000d\u000a      designed for training in both urban and rural settings in South Africa. It\u000d\u000a      is interactive, it includes original research based material (written by\u000d\u000a      the authors), key readings (including published research by the authors)\u000d\u000a      and educational tasks (drafted by the authors) designed to help the\u000d\u000a      student \/ practitioner work through the material and ideas presented\u000d\u000a      (5.5). This training resource enables students and health care workers to\u000d\u000a      understand the social and cultural basis of HIV\/AIDS &#8212; transmission,\u000d\u000a      treatment and management &#8212; thus influencing their practice with HIV\u000d\u000a      positive service users in particular (5.6).\u000d\u000a    The resource has been prescribed in nine (of seventeen traditional and\u000d\u000a      comprehensive) HEIs throughout South Africa since the publication of the\u000d\u000a      first edition. These include: The University of South Africa, University\u000d\u000a      of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Pietermaritzburg, University of Cape Town, University\u000d\u000a      of the Western Cape, University of the Witwatersrand, University of\u000d\u000a      Namibia, Baragwanath Nursing College, Democratic Nursing Organisation of\u000d\u000a      South Africa. The main beneficiaries of this resource are health and\u000d\u000a      social care professionals and people living with HIV\/AIDS who receive a\u000d\u000a      more culturally and social informed service (5.4). The success of the\u000d\u000a      first and second editions led Pan Macmillan to support the production of\u000d\u000a      the third edition.\u000d\u000a    The three research strands identified in section 2 (all of which\u000d\u000a      influenced the production of the educational resource) led to other\u000d\u000a      publications, thus having wider impacts on policy formulation and public\u000d\u000a      debates on HIV\/AIDS. This was particularly important in the context of\u000d\u000a      initial government refusal to provide ART to people living with HIV\/AIDS\u000d\u000a      (see above references to the research). In the foreword to the book Waiting\u000d\u000a        to Happen: HIV\/AIDS in South Africa, Mr Justice Edwin Cameron stated\u000d\u000a      `The book draws on an impressive and authoritative range of papers that\u000d\u000a      address the social, cultural and historical roots of the epidemic in a\u000d\u000a      region heavily burdened by AIDS. It is therefore published at an acute\u000d\u000a      time' (pg 7) (5.1). During the period in which the research was carried\u000d\u000a      out and published, government policy in South Africa changed to adopt a\u000d\u000a      centrally funded roll-out of ART, significantly changing the trajectory of\u000d\u000a      the epidemic. This research was part of a body of social science research\u000d\u000a      which contributed to this policy change. All of the projects have received\u000d\u000a      external funding and have involved international collaboration.\u000d\u000a    Waiting to happen: HIV\/AIDS in South Africa was also published in\u000d\u000a      a separate version in the United States. In 2004, 1500 copies of this US\u000d\u000a      edition were printed &#8212; only 63 now remain in stock (5.2). This text was\u000d\u000a      recommended reading on a course at Yale University, Aids in Africa,\u000d\u000a      between 2006\/ 09.\u000d\u000a    The body of scholarship which has as its primary focus the socio-cultural\u000d\u000a      context of HIV\/AIDS has been published in different formats. The research\u000d\u000a      has been published in leading international journals of medicine and\u000d\u000a      public health thus informing academic and scholars working in the area.\u000d\u000a      However, in the context of HIV\/AIDS in resource poor countries it is\u000d\u000a      incumbent on scholars to produce and reproduce strong research material in\u000d\u000a      a way which will serve to combat the epidemic and improve the quality of\u000d\u000a      life and services for those people living with HIV\/AIDS. The training\u000d\u000a      resource and the strands of research identified above have succeeded in\u000d\u000a      doing this (5.4).\u000d\u000a    Other researchers contributed to this research. `The social and cultural\u000d\u000a      complexity of adherence to ART', was conducted jointly with Professor Leah\u000d\u000a      Gilbert (University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg).

The research outlined below has contributed\u000d\u000a      centrally to a social scientific understanding of HIV\/AIDS in\u000d\u000a      resource-poor contexts.\u000d\u000a    This case study is built on a programme of research into the\u000d\u000a      socio-cultural aspects of HIV\/AIDS. This research has identified the\u000d\u000a      dominance of HIV\/AIDS in all health and social care practice in South\u000d\u000a      Africa and shaped an understanding of the social dimensions of the\u000d\u000a      epidemic which is critical to halting the spread of the epidemic and\u000d\u000a      influencing its management. The educational resource, now in its 3rd\u000d\u000a      edition (2010), was built on a body of scholarship which has three\u000d\u000a      strands:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The first strand focused on the role of culture and cultural\u000d\u000a            practices in the treatment of HIV\/AIDS. This was a\u000d\u000a        collaborative research project between the University of Hull (Walker)\u000d\u000a        and the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (Gilbert). The\u000d\u000a        contribution of the research expertise located at the University of Hull\u000d\u000a        was central to the successful completion of this project. The research\u000d\u000a        project was entitled, `The social and cultural complexity of adherence\u000d\u000a        to antiretroviral therapy (ART)'. The research was conducted with health\u000d\u000a        workers and people living with HIV\/AIDS in a state health clinic in\u000d\u000a        Hillbrow, Johannesburg, during 2005\/6. The administration and management\u000d\u000a        of ART, particularly during this initial period of state funded\u000d\u000a        provision in South Africa, was highly complex &#8212; public health services\u000d\u000a        were (in general) ill-equipped and under-resourced and the disease\u000d\u000a        highly stigmatised. This externally funded research project aimed to\u000d\u000a        better understand the social and cultural barriers to effective\u000d\u000a        treatment and change the ways in which ART was delivered in HIV\/AIDS\u000d\u000a        clinics. The treatment of HIV\/AIDS is thus also a cultural process,\u000d\u000a        particularly in the South African context. This research identified the\u000d\u000a        stigmatised nature of `specialised AIDS clinics'; the ways in which ART\u000d\u000a        `marked' and stigmatised patients; created unwanted and forced\u000d\u000a        `disclosure' to employers \/ family members etc. The research focused on\u000d\u000a        the need to incorporate these understandings into planning service\u000d\u000a        provision. This project resulted in two journal articles in leading\u000d\u000a        international public health \/ health journals and has been incorporated\u000d\u000a        into the educational and training resource.\u000d\u000a      The second strand of research offered a gendered analysis\u000d\u000a        of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic. The research study which demonstrates this was\u000d\u000a        a study entitled Masculinities, Risk and HIV\/AIDS. It aimed to\u000d\u000a        examine the ways in which men (in particular) and unequal gender\u000d\u000a        relations more broadly are key drivers of the epidemic in South Africa\u000d\u000a        (5.4). This research demonstrates how dominant hegemonic masculinities\u000d\u000a        have led to men engaging in risky sexual practice (e.g. multiple sexual\u000d\u000a        partners, unsafe sex), placing them (and women) at high risk for HIV\u000d\u000a        infection. The field work for this study was conducted in Johannesburg,\u000d\u000a        South Africa during 2002\/3. The data was analysed and written up at the\u000d\u000a        University of Hull, from 2004, drawing on the expertise at that\u000d\u000a        institution (Walker). This research resulted in the publication of an\u000d\u000a        edited collection, Men Behaving Differently. South African men since\u000d\u000a          1994 (2005) and a journal article in a leading international\u000d\u000a        journal in the field (Culture, Health and Sexuality). The edited\u000d\u000a        collection was the product of research collaboration between the\u000d\u000a        University of Hull (Walker) and the Wits Institute for Social and\u000d\u000a        Economic Research, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (Reid).\u000d\u000a      The third strand addressed the historical and social causes\u000d\u000a        of HIV\/AIDS in southern Africa and resulted in the publication of a\u000d\u000a        book, Waiting to Happen: HIV\/AIDS in South Africa (2004). The\u000d\u000a        monograph was based on a wide range of research presented at an\u000d\u000a        international social science HIV\/AIDS conference, held at the University\u000d\u000a        of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in 2001. The book, commissioned by\u000d\u000a        the History Workshop, University of the Witwatersrand, sought to\u000d\u000a        popularise and make accessible, empirical, academic research. The\u000d\u000a        conference on which the text is based was the first of its kind in South\u000d\u000a        Africa and brought together academics, government ministers, HIV\/AIDS\u000d\u000a        activists and NGOs. This book was an important corrective to the\u000d\u000a        predominant emphasis on bio-medical explanations of, and responses to,\u000d\u000a        HIV\/AIDS and argued for the need for wide-spread availability of\u000d\u000a        Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) at a time when the government did not\u000d\u000a        recognise its importance in treating and preventing HIV\/AIDS. This text\u000d\u000a        has strongly informed the third edition of the educational training\u000d\u000a        resource identified above.

Professor Hills\u000d\u000a      was subsequently asked to\u000d\u000a      carry this out, supported by a team based in the Department of Energy and\u000d\u000a      Climate Change\u000d\u000a      (DECC). The review drew on insights from earlier research within CASE,\u000d\u000a      from other institutions,\u000d\u000a      and new analysis by the review team [7]. The report's statistical analysis\u000d\u000a      shared the Royal\u000d\u000a      Statistical Society's 2012 award for `excellence in official statistics'.\u000d\u000a    On publication in March 2012, the government announced that later that\u000d\u000a      year it would issue a\u000d\u000a      consultation paper in response. Shortly afterwards, the Deputy Prime\u000d\u000a      Minister announced that a\u000d\u000a      further part of the resources which energy companies must provide to\u000d\u000a      support energy efficiency\u000d\u000a      measures under the Energy Company Obligation (ECO), equivalent to &#163;190\u000d\u000a      million per year, would\u000d\u000a      be ring-fenced for a `Carbon Saving Communities Obligation'.

Following the review's\u000d\u000a      key final\u000d\u000a      recommendation, it announced that an `updated, refreshed' [A, p.3]\u000d\u000a      strategy for tackling fuel\u000d\u000a      poverty would be published in 2013. It committed the government to moving\u000d\u000a      away from the current\u000d\u000a      official definition and put forward a new framework for measurement. It\u000d\u000a      stated that the government\u000d\u000a      agreed with `Professor Hills' assessment of the weaknesses of the current\u000d\u000a      definition, and ... that\u000d\u000a      the Low Income High Costs framework [developed by Hills] provides a better\u000d\u000a      approach to\u000d\u000a      understanding the issue of fuel poverty and intend to adopt it as the main\u000d\u000a      measure of fuel poverty\u000d\u000a      in future' [A, p.24].\u000d\u000a    In terms of technical construction of the indicator, the consultation\u000d\u000a      proposed adoption of all but one\u000d\u000a      of the review's detailed recommendations, including measurement of income\u000d\u000a      after housing costs\u000d\u000a      and adjusted for family size, how relative energy costs should be\u000d\u000a      measured, and how thresholds\u000d\u000a      for low income and high costs should be set (the exception was the\u000d\u000a      treatment of certain disability\u000d\u000a      benefits, although DECC later said that parallel statistics will be\u000d\u000a      published reflecting both\u000d\u000a      treatments). DECC's 2013 Fuel Poverty Statistics, which cited Hills' work\u000d\u000a      extensively, included\u000d\u000a      data on the new proposed basis, alongside the current measure [B].\u000d\u000a    In July 2013 the government published its response to the consultation,\u000d\u000a      announcing that it will\u000d\u000a      `adopt the overall Low Income High Costs framework as the new indicator of\u000d\u000a      fuel poverty. This will\u000d\u000a      be used in future assessments of fuel poverty in England' [C, p.6].\u000d\u000a    It also published a `framework for future action', announcing that it\u000d\u000a      would be proposing\u000d\u000a      amendments to the 2013 Energy Bill to underpin a future government\u000d\u000a      strategy for fuel poverty (to\u000d\u000a      follow enactment of the Bill). The document suggested that the `new\u000d\u000a      definition is a powerful tool' to\u000d\u000a      `design effective solutions' [D, p.5], using the basis of the `outstanding\u000d\u000a      work' undertaken by\u000d\u000a      Professor Hills [D, p.5 and p.7].\u000d\u000a    Wider Implications: The citation for Professor Hills's knighthood\u000d\u000a      in June 2013 stated that: `His\u000d\u000a      independent review of fuel poverty will help to target assistance at those\u000d\u000a      who need it most, with a\u000d\u000a      long-lasting impact through quality of life improvements for some of the\u000d\u000a      most vulnerable in society'.\u000d\u000a      The Unit's research therefore led to a significant change in official\u000d\u000a      understanding and\u000d\u000a      measurement. In turn this has contributed to a change in the focus of\u000d\u000a      policy and distribution of\u000d\u000a      resources available for energy efficiency improvements, potentially\u000d\u000a      leading to more effective\u000d\u000a      policies benefiting several million people. This should have benefits in\u000d\u000a      reducing hardship, health\u000d\u000a      problems, and mitigating adverse side-effects of climate change policies.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Fuel poverty is a serious social problem.

It has taken a particular interest in\u000d\u000a      housing, including the quality of the\u000d\u000a      housing stock.\u000d\u000a    In the early 2000s, CASE research examined fuel poverty and the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of policies towards\u000d\u000a      it, pointing to conflicts between official measures of who was classified\u000d\u000a      as `fuel poor' and the ways\u000d\u000a      programmes were targeted [2]. It used data from the English House\u000d\u000a      Condition Survey and the\u000d\u000a      British Household Panel Survey to look at the extent to which being in\u000d\u000a      fuel poverty persisted over\u000d\u000a      time, and the effects of turnover in the housing stock [3].\u000d\u000a    Following this work, CASE was commissioned by government to carry out a\u000d\u000a      `peer review' of the\u000d\u000a      methodology used in creating the official statistics [4]. Several of this\u000d\u000a      review's suggestions for\u000d\u000a      technical improvements were incorporated into the official statistics; the\u000d\u000a      review also raised other\u000d\u000a      issues, such as the treatment of housing costs. However, the review's\u000d\u000a      terms of reference ruled out\u000d\u000a      examination of the fundamental form of the measure, which was based on a\u000d\u000a      ratio between required\u000d\u000a      energy costs and income.\u000d\u000a    Since 2005, research within CASE has examined the impact and\u000d\u000a      implementation of energy\u000d\u000a      efficiency measures for the housing stock, and the lessons that could be\u000d\u000a      drawn from experiences\u000d\u000a      in other countries, such as Germany. It also examined the distributional\u000d\u000a      impact of measures\u000d\u000a      intended to mitigate climate change by increasing energy prices. This\u000d\u000a      showed the regressiveness\u000d\u000a      of policies that increase the price of domestic fuel, but also the\u000d\u000a      existence of low-income losers &#8212;\u000d\u000a      disproportionately high energy users &#8212; even if other tax and benefit\u000d\u000a      measures removed this\u000d\u000a      regressiveness between income groups on average [5].\u000d\u000a    In Spring 2011 Professor Hills was invited by the Secretary of State for\u000d\u000a      Energy and Climate\u000d\u000a      Change to undertake an independent review of how fuel poverty has been\u000d\u000a      measured officially,\u000d\u000a      examining the problem from first principles. He published an Interim\u000d\u000a      Report in October 2011,\u000d\u000a      exploring the reasons why `fuel poverty' constitutes a distinct problem,\u000d\u000a      pointing to flaws in the\u000d\u000a      fundamental design of the existing measure, and suggesting an alternative\u000d\u000a      approach [6]. Following\u000d\u000a      public consultation and further analysis, he produced his final findings\u000d\u000a      and recommendations in\u000d\u000a      March 2012 [7].\u000d\u000a    Hills suggested that fuel poverty was a concern from three overlapping\u000d\u000a      perspectives: health and\u000d\u000a      well-being; compounding of hardship; and for climate change. At the core\u000d\u000a      of the problem are\u000d\u000a      people with both low incomes and disproportionately high energy\u000d\u000a      requirements. However, this\u000d\u000a      situation is not what is captured by the existing official `10 per cent'\u000d\u000a      measure, which sometimes\u000d\u000a      includes relatively high income households as `fuel poor' and can exclude\u000d\u000a      others with low incomes\u000d\u000a      and high energy costs. The picture it gives of the changing extent of the\u000d\u000a      problem over time\u000d\u000a      produces dramatic fluctuations unrelated to progress on the ground. The\u000d\u000a      design of the existing\u000d\u000a      measure can encourage a policy focus on those with the smallest problems.\u000d\u000a    Drawing on this analysis, Hills put forward an alternative approach,\u000d\u000a      which replaced the official `10\u000d\u000a      per cent' measure by the combination of (i) an indicator of the extent of\u000d\u000a      the problem, given by the\u000d\u000a      number of people with both low income and relatively high energy\u000d\u000a      requirements (the `Low Income\u000d\u000a      High Costs' indicator), and (ii) a new `Fuel Poverty Gap' indicator\u000d\u000a      capturing its depth. His final\u000d\u000a      report [7] pointed not only to the gravity of the problem and the fact\u000d\u000a      that it was likely to grow rather\u000d\u000a      than be eliminated by 2016 under current policies, but also to the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness and high social\u000d\u000a      returns from energy efficiency measures aimed at those with low incomes\u000d\u000a      living in the hardest-to-heat\u000d\u000a      homes.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers: Professor John Hills has been at LSE since 1986;\u000d\u000a      Mr Tom Sefton (Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow, CASE, 1997-2009)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38870","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    At the political and policy levels, Allen's research has informed\u000a        political thinking, encouraged engagement, and seen him established as a\u000a        key adviser to the British Government on Islamophobia and\u000a      anti-Muslim hate.

The following month, he facilitated a symposium at\u000a      the University of Birmingham with approximately 150 local policymakers and\u000a      community activists where the outcomes from that year's activities were\u000a      shared and discussed.\u000a    These activities contributed to the calling of a closed Parliamentary\u000a        meeting in March 2010 that drew together a collaboration of\u000a      concerned parties to lobby for the establishment of an All Party\u000a      Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Islamophobia. Allen supported the above\u000a      groups (also including the Runnymede Trust and the European Muslim\u000a      Research Centre) to draw together the necessary evidence to successfully\u000a      submit to Government. An APPG on Islamophobia was duly launched in\u000a      November 2010. Coinciding with the publication of Allen's monograph\u000a      entitled `Islamophobia' (Ashgate), the three co-chairs of the APPG &#8212; Simon\u000a      Hughes (Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey &amp; Old Southwark), Jack\u000a      Straw (Labour MP for Blackburn) and Kris Hopkins (Conservative MP for\u000a      Keighley &amp; Ilkley) &#8212; requested copies of the book. This led to Simon\u000a      Hughes requesting a meeting with Allen in February 2012 to discuss the\u000a      future direction of the APPG and the best way to inform Government\u000a        thinking and the subsequent policies required. A few months after,\u000a      Hughes approached Allen to research and deliver an independent report &#8212;\u000a      `\"A momentous occasion\": A report on the All Party Parliamentary Group\u000a      on Islamophobia and its Secretariat'. In it, Allen identified some of the\u000a      challenges that might be encountered, those relating to Islamophobia's\u000a      contested nature, its lack of definition and the need for it to be seen as\u000a      an exclusionary phenomenon comparable with other similar phenomena such as\u000a      racism, homophobia and others (see source 1 below).\u000a    On 14 November 2011, Allen presented these findings in the form of both\u000a      oral and written evidence to the APPG (source 2). Making nine\u000a      recommendations to the APPG including the need to establish a\u000a        policy-based working definition, the need to explore the\u000a        evidence base for Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate, collate\u000a      quantitative data relating to anti-Muslim hate crimes and to work closely\u000a      with the mooted Cross-Government Anti-Muslim Hate Working Group, Hughes\u000a      suggested these would provide the APPG with an indicative work programme\u000a      (work continues to move this forward). Since then, Allen has worked in\u000a      partnership with the APPG and its Chairs, offering advice and support as\u000a      also presenting further oral and written evidence (Muslims in the media,\u000a      24 October 2012; Islamophobia post-Woolwich, 16 July 2013). The co-chairs\u000a      of the APPG are clear that through his work with the APPG and beyond `Dr.\u000a        Allen's research and knowledge on Islamophobia has been, and will\u000a        continue to be, crucial in influencing the debate in\u000a          Parliament and amongst the public' (source 3).\u000a    In line with Allen's recommendation to the APPG, in January 2012 Allen\u000a      was approached to sit as an independent expert for the newly established\u000a      Cross-Government Anti-Muslim Hate Working Group in the Department of\u000a      Communities &amp; Local Government (CLG). As part of this, he participates\u000a      in bi-monthly meetings to support Government in trying to improve\u000a        political understanding about Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate, its\u000a        drivers, causes and manifestations. In doing so, Allen regularly\u000a      shares the findings from his existing and ongoing research to shape and\u000a      influence political and policy thinking. This includes written\u000a      submissions, a number of which have focused on: the social and political\u000a      engagement of Muslim women; the political engagement of Muslim\u000a      representatives; similarities with the phenomena of anti-Semitism; and\u000a      Islamophobic attacks on mosques. As part of his role on the Working Group,\u000a      Allen has been appointed co-lead of the Group's research workstream, a\u000a      role that requires him to highlight to Government where there are gaps\u000a        in evidence and knowledge in relation to Islamophobia and\u000a      anti-Muslim hate. Allen's contribution has been described as `instrumental',\u000a      indeed, one policy advisor from CLG states that Allen's work on the group\u000a      and research contributions have helped him to `develop and improve\u000a          Government policy, particularly as it relates to\u000a        increasing reporting of anti-Muslim hatred' (source 4).\u000a    Out of the Working Group emerged a government funded project named `TELL\u000a      MAMA (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks)', a third party reporting service for\u000a      anti-Muslim hate crimes and incidents. Having been requested to sit as a\u000a      member of the project's steering group by Government, Allen also spoke at\u000a      both the London and Birmingham launches where he noted how he had called\u000a      for the establishment\u000a        of something similar in an article written for the Daily\u000a        Telegraph in February 2010 (source 5). He also welcomed the project\u000a      given it supported his earlier identification of the need for greater\u000a        evidence. In November 2012, the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg\u000a      announced further funding for the project following a recommendation from\u000a      the Working Group (source 6).\u000a    Given her keen interest in the topic of Islamophobia and having seen the\u000a    various written submissions made to the APPG and Working Group by Allen,\u000a    Baroness Sayeeda Warsi (Minister for Communities &amp; Faith) has since\u000a    December 2012 been working in collaboration with him to raise awareness\u000a      and promote greater political recognition. On 24 January 2013,\u000a    Baroness Warsi referenced what she described as Allen's \"excellent\" research\u000a    findings in a keynote speech in London (source 7). At the same event, Simon\u000a    Hughes reiterated his admiration for Allen's research in a further public\u000a    speech. Most recently, Warsi drew upon Allen's research knowledge about\u000a    Islamophobia in the West Midlands following a series of bomb attacks on\u000a    mosques in the Black Country region. Meeting face to face (16 July 2013),\u000a    they discussed what might be an appropriate response by Government. Indeed,\u000a    Warsi stated that `the advice and evidence provided to us by Dr Allen &#8212;\u000a    through his membership of our Anti-Muslim Hatred Working Group; his position\u000a    on Tell MAMA's steering group and through his direct engagement with policy\u000a    makers and analysts &#8212; has helped us to develop our understanding of\u000a    this complex issue. His depth of understanding of the issue following a\u000a    decade of working on it, and the rigour of his approach are particularly\u000a    valuable to us' (source 8).\u000a    In trying to ensure that research findings and policy developments are shared\u000a        at the public and community levels, in November 2012 Allen\u000a      facilitated an ESRC Festival of Social Science an event in Birmingham\u000a      titled, \"From Pavement to Parliament: Shaping the policies to tackle\u000a      Islamophobia\". Bridging the divide geographically between Birmingham and\u000a      London as also the public and the political, the event brought together\u000a      those involved in the APPG and Working Group with local policymakers,\u000a      activists and communities. Allen also has an active and well-followed\u000a      Twitter feed (@DrChrisAllen &#8212; around 1000 followers, daily tweets) and\u000a      blog (http:\/\/www.chris-allen.co.uk\/),\u000awhich\u000a      he uses for this purpose. Allen's engagement with traditional media in the\u000a      UK and internationally is frequent and diverse, ensuring his research\u000a      reaches wide audiences. Some examples of that coverage in the 2008-2013\u000a      period are through: Daily Telegraph (source 5); New Statesman (source 9);\u000a      Huffington Post (source 10): BBC Radio WM (source 11).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Chris Allen's research into Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hatred has\u000a      had a direct influence on the political thinking and emerging policy\u000a      developments of central government in the United Kingdom.

It has explored how Islamophobia is\u000a      perceived and what its relationships are, or indeed might be with other\u000a      similar discriminatory and prejudicial phenomena. This has included\u000a      considering how other discriminatory phenomena have been historically\u000a      tackled: socially, politically and through policy interventions also.\u000a      Allen's research both links into and significantly extends current debates\u000a      about Islamophobia, the role and place of Muslims and Islam in\u000a      contemporary society, the legislation and policy relating to\u000a      discrimination and equalities and how best to work towards a fairer, more\u000a      equitable and equal cohesive society.\u000a    Key research findings include:\u000a    \u000a      That Islamophobia is an extremely complex and contested concept, one\u000a        that in part has been caused by the overly simplistic definitions and\u000a        theories that had been widely appropriated and employed\u000a      That a new theoretical and conceptual model for Islamophobia was\u000a        necessary especially if Islamophobia as a discriminatory phenomenon was\u000a        to be responded to and tackled via policy\u000a      That whilst it can be argued that Islamophobia is in many ways\u000a        distinct and contemporary, it also has many significant similarities and\u000a        overlaps with other discriminatory phenomena including racism and\u000a        anti-Semitism\u000a      Established a new definition and conceptual model for Islamophobia,\u000a        the latter a threefold approach that incorporates the ideological,\u000a        attitudinal and exclusionary levels\u000a      Unlike existing definitions and models, the latter exclusionary level\u000a        identified prejudice and discrimination as also violence as a tool for\u000a        exclusion thereby allowing for greater scrutiny and enquiry as regards\u000a        existing policy and legislative frames relating to equalities and hate\u000a        crime amongst others\u000a    \u000a    In the period 2001-2006, Allen was Co-I on a project funded by the\u000a      European Union to map the spread of Islamophobia in fifteen member states\u000a      following the attacks of 9\/11. To this day, this project remains the\u000a      largest monitoring project undertaken into Islamophobia; and its report is\u000a      widely cited. Following the completion of his doctoral research, Allen\u000a      continued his individual research through the production of papers and\u000a      chapters, continuing to highlight the inadequacies of existing notions of\u000a      Islamophobia and the need for an improved understanding of the impact\u000a      anti-Muslim hate has at the community level. In 2010, Allen undertook\u000a      primary research with Muslims and Muslim organisations in the West\u000a      Midlands and elsewhere in the UK to build an evidence base of Islamophobic\u000a      and anti-Muslim hate crime (as researcher for a project in collaboration\u000a      with the European Muslim Research Centre). Following the publication of\u000a      his monograph in 2010, Allen was commissioned by the newly established All\u000a      Party Parliamentary Group on Islamophobia to produce a report exploring\u000a      the challenges in tackling Islamophobia. In 2010, Allen directed a team of\u000a      researchers at the University as part of a project funded by the\u000a      Department for Communities &amp; Local Government to explore the\u000a      discrimination faced by Muslim women in contemporary Britain. This project\u000a      involved working with grassroots communities whilst also facilitating\u000a      workshops for academics, community representatives, theologians and\u000a      policymakers. Throughout his research, Allen has combined academic rigour\u000a      with a concern for `real-world' relevance. Alongside working within\u000a      academic and policy frames, there has been a conscious recognition that\u000a      research findings need to be disseminated and made relevant to\u000a      stakeholders in the third and community sectors also.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38871","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of our new migration research has reached policy makers,\u000a      practitioners and communities, shaping policy and practice around migrant\u000a      integration.\u000a    1) Equal project (sources 3 and 11)\u000a      The research findings were used to construct a refugee employability\u000a      pathway: a model that provided a holistic approach to returning skilled\u000a      refugees to employment in their area of expertise. A report was\u000a      disseminated at the National Refugee Integration Forum (NRIF) in 2007 (30\u000a      members) which led to the first national integration programme in\u000a      the UK in 2008 (Refugee Employment and Integration Service with 43\u000a      offices). Working with partner organisations, including FE Colleges,\u000a      Jobcentre Plus, the Trellis Project and the Learning and Skills Council\u000a      (LSC), the research team established five pilot employability pathways for\u000a      refugees in the West Midlands. They focused upon general construction;\u000a      general maintenance; social research; business administration; and nursing\u000a      pre-adaptation. The pathways brought together elements of good practice\u000a      from across the EU in a multi-dimensional, personalised, approach not\u000a      before attempted in the UK. The project evaluation showed that as a result\u000a      of participation some 54 refugees gained permanent employment; in\u000a      addition, four refugees became self-employed and a further 15 went on to\u000a      higher-level training. The pathway approach was adapted and adopted\u000a      by Birmingham City Council who set up a Working Neighbourhoods Funded\u000a      programme in 2009 (c120 beneficiaries). Findings were disseminated to\u000a      local, national and EU policymakers with Jenny Phillimore and one of the\u000a      Community Researchers, (source 10), presenting the findings at the\u000a      European Parliament (2008) and in Germany (2009) to MEPs and civil\u000a      servants working in the field of integration.\u000a    2) Making a Difference (sources 4 and 10)\u000a      In 2008 eighteen migrant and refugee community group (MRCO) leaders\u000a      participated in a training programme accredited by the Open College\u000a      Network and run by researchers from the University of Birmingham. Some 16\u000a      received qualifications in research skills. Once trained they worked with\u000a      Birmingham New Communities Network (BNCN) to identify areas where evidence\u000a      was needed to secure changes in policy and practice (2008). The areas of\u000a      focus were mental health, ESOL, truancy and access to skilled employment.\u000a      Some 20 Birmingham based policymakers committed in a policy seminar to\u000a      helping to provide evidence and disseminate the findings. Care Services\u000a      Improvement Partnership and Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust\u000a      funded a conference (2008) to disseminate the mental health findings to\u000a      over 200 delegates 80% of whom were regionally or locally based\u000a      professionals, 10% nationally based professional and policymakers and 10%\u000a      refugees or refugee support workers. Following the conference funding was\u000a      provided for a regional refugee mental health network to bring\u000a      practitioners together to overcome problems identified in our research. In\u000a      addition the NHS funded the Medical Foundation to establish a base in the\u000a      West Midlands to support GPs treating refugees with mental health\u000a      problems. As a direct consequence of their involvement in the project BNCN\u000a        received further funding from JRF and the Digbeth Trust and today have\u000a        paid staff providing advice to MRCOs (source 10). The Learning and\u000a      Skills Council reviewed their approach to commissioning and\u000a      monitoring ESOL and introduced a new ESOL programme for refugees\u000a      (c 300 beneficiaries 2009). Six community researchers continue to work as\u000a      part of a team of multilingual community researchers who have undertaken\u000a      numerous subsequent funded projects.\u000a    3) Health and Wealthy Together\u000a      The data collated as a part of the University of Birmingham research was\u000a      used to develop the Birmingham City Council's (BCC) Social Inclusion\u000a      strategy and contributed to the adoption of \"embracing superdiversity\"\u000a        as one of BCC's five commitments to social inclusion (source 5). The\u000a      team are currently working with Public Health and BCC to set up the\u000a      quarterly collation of Flag 4 data.\u000a    4) Migrant maternity (sources 2, 5 and 7)\u000a      The report from this study was disseminated at a policy seminar (2010)\u000a      attended by regional and national actors including the NHS and Home Office\u000a      (35 attendees). Papers have appeared in Practicing Midwife and the Royal\u000a      College of Midwives Journal: these publications reach every midwife in\u000a        the UK and some overseas. The team recommended that funding was\u000a      provided for civil society organisations to work in partnership with\u000a      maternity services. As a result, Asirt (an organisation working with\u000a      destitute migrants) was given funding for a post in 2010 to support\u000a      pregnant migrants. In addition the multi-agency West Midlands Strategic\u000a      Migration Partnership, who were members of the project Advisory Board,\u000a      were given a seat on the Maternity Action advisory group overseeing\u000a      training for midwives working with asylum seeking and refugee women, and\u000a      our findings helped shape the content of the course delivered to\u000a        midwives in Coventry and Birmingham (2011). The findings support\u000a      ongoing work with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) on the revision of the\u000a      health asylum instruction. The evidence was presented to Strategic Health\u000a      Authority maternity leads at a meeting in London 2011 and informed a\u000a        meeting in which the Department of Health requested that UKBA cease\u000a      dispersal of women in late stages of pregnancy. The identification and\u000a      referral pathways for pregnant women who pass through hostel services in\u000a      Birmingham have been improved providing them with improved access\u000a      to maternity care (source 7). The report and regional work on maternity\u000a      and migration have been recognised as example of best practice as part of\u000a      the Better Health for Better Integration EU project (source 2). Members of\u000a      the research steering group delivered a presentation to a transnational\u000a      workshop organised by the South West Public Health Observatory (2011):\u000a      http:\/\/www.bhbi.eu\/sites\/default\/files\/BETTERHEALTH_broch.pdf.\u000a    In November 2012 the ESRC Festival of Social Sciences provided funds to\u000a      support 2 events with 80 midwives in conjunction with City Hospital. The\u000a      findings and recommendations on \"what midwives can do\" were presented with\u000a      three voluntary organisations (ASIRT as above, Hope Projects, Bethal Doula\u000a      Project) who talked about their work. Resulting from this action the team\u000a      were asked to send the report to the CEO of Birmingham Women's Hospital so\u000a      it could inform the ongoing review of maternity provision and to\u000a      present the findings at the House of Commons Inquiry into Asylum Support\u000a      for Families. The findings are a key element of the report of this inquiry\u000a      (source 6). Following the ESRC event, Professor Phillimore met with the\u000a      head of midwifery training at Birmingham City University and worked with\u000a      them to organise a conference on migrant families for midwives and health\u000a      visitors in Birmingham on 8th July 2013. This was attended by\u000a      75 practitioners; the Migrant Maternity research formed the basis of the\u000a      keynote presentation.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research has enabled more effective integration of refugees and\u000a      other new migrants into society both at individual level by helping\u000a      individual migrants to gain access to employment and improved social\u000a      welfare provision, and at a strategic level by influencing the development\u000a      of policy initiatives around refugee employment, mental health and migrant\u000a      access to maternity services.

This project identified initiatives\u000a      that were key to successful integration, namely the need for holistic\u000a      programmes that brought together language training, work experience and\u000a      volunteering, and accreditation of prior and experiential learning (APEL).\u000a    2) The Making a Difference project funded by the Joseph Rowntree\u000a      Foundation (2006-2007). In this project the team trained refugees from 18\u000a      community organisations in accredited post-graduate research skills and\u000a      worked with migrant and refugee community groups to identify a research\u000a      agenda around areas they considered to be of most importance to refugee\u000a      integration. Under the supervision of mentors the community researchers\u000a      collected qualitative data about refugee mental health and access to\u000a      language training. Once the data were analysed the research team worked\u000a      with a new community group to use this evidence to make a difference to\u000a      regional and local refugee integration policy. The project identified\u000a      flaws in the Learning and Skills Council's ESOL monitoring system and\u000a      major gaps in support for refugees with mental health problems.\u000a    3) Healthy and Wealthy Together was sponsored by the EU INTI fund\u000a      (2009-2011). This project brought together partners from eight different\u000a      EU cities working together to identify mechanisms to improve migrants\u000a      access to healthcare. Through the Birmingham partnership the collation and\u000a      analysis of new migrant Flag 4 data was achieved, giving Birmingham City\u000a      Council and health providers a sense of the scale and location of new\u000a      migration.\u000a    4) Migrant Maternity project funded by the Department of Health\u000a      (2009-2010). This project looked at the experiences of migrants using the\u000a      maternity system in the UK and identified gaps in services and documented\u000a      the challenges that maternity professionals experienced trying to support\u000a      migrants. It highlighted the key role of civil society organisations in\u000a      supporting pregnant migrants and how migration status rather than\u000a      ethnicity was a key determinant of the maternity experience. This project\u000a      has led to changes in local and national policy and practice with others\u000a      still emerging. The findings have been presented at a House of Commons\u000a      Inquiry into Asylum Support for Families (see source 6 below) and, as part\u000a      of the ESRC Festival of Social Science 2012, to commissioners, midwives,\u000a      trainers and other maternity professionals at events in the Department of\u000a      Health West Midlands and City Hospital (60 attendees plus a further 70 at\u000a      a recent event on migrant families).\u000a    The culmination of this body of research has led to the development of a\u000a      new University of Birmingham Institute for Research into Superdiversity\u000a      (IRiS) in 2012, directed by Jenny Phillimore, and the development of a new\u000a      Practitioner Research Programme, led by Lisa Goodson.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38872","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research was crucial to the initial development of Birmingham's care\u000a      home closure methodology, with the summary of good practice provided by Le\u000a      Mesurier and Littlechild (R1) directly influencing the subsequent design\u000a      of local policy and procedures.\u000a    After this, the subsequent evaluation by the University of Birmingham was\u000a      specifically designed to report interim findings part way through the\u000a      closure process so that any emerging lessons about outcomes for older\u000a      people (positive or negative) could be directly incorporated into\u000a      subsequent closures. This provided a crucial form of external,\u000a        independent scrutiny and meant that the research findings would\u000a      directly influence policy and practice. In the event, the research found\u000a      improved outcomes as a result of the closure process and so Council\u000a      procedures were confirmed and continued. Had mortality increased, however,\u000a      there would have been a major opportunity for the City Council to rethink\u000a      its approach and change its methods\/working practices. The impact of the\u000a      research then was the provision of a `sense check' and safeguard in\u000a      the process for Birmingham's older people and their families.\u000a    The research was also key to securing buy-in from the people of\u000a        Birmingham (including the affected older people and their families)\u000a      ahead of a controversial closure plan. The commissioning of the evaluation\u000a      demonstrated the commitment of Birmingham City Council to ensuring they\u000a      carried out their closures in a responsive way and that their decisions\u000a      were transparent and robust, being endorsed by verifiable research\u000a      (indeed, the Birmingham study is believed to have provided the most\u000a      extensive publicly available data on care home closure in the country). As\u000a      part of this process, the studies produced by the University of Birmingham\u000a      (R1 and R2) were made publically available and the process and findings\u000a      held to scrutiny. As a result the research also contributed to the\u000a        smooth continuation of the closure plan, in conjunction with the\u000a      positive experiences of those moved in the closures (source 1).\u000a    In 2011, towards the end of the study, the high profile news story on the\u000a      financial problems in Southern Cross began to emerge. The University of\u000a      Birmingham was commissioned by ADASS to produce high quality but rapid\u000a      guidance (a 2 month project from start to national dissemination) for all\u000a      local authorities in England based on their research. This was carried out\u000a      in very difficult media and political circumstances owing to the very\u000a      large nature of Southern Cross, the significant distress being caused to\u000a      older people and their families and political pressures on the then Health\u000a      Secretary (who was facing criticisms of potential privatisation around the\u000a      Health Bill just as a major private company was in trouble in adult social\u000a      care). The situation was also made more complicated by media stories about\u000a      the quick wins\/high risk nature of venture capital investment in Southern\u000a      Cross, the complexity of understanding the various holding companies and\u000a      off-shore banks involved, and the fact that one of the investors that\u000a      might have withdrawn money and triggered bankruptcy was RBS (a bank owned\u000a      by the tax payer).\u000a    It was for this reason that the University of Birmingham was approached\u000a      to conduct the research in the first place &#8212; given its longstanding\u000a      reputation for `rigour and relevance', its ability to conduct confidential\u000a      research quickly and discretely, and its role as a critical friend to\u000a      health and social care policy. In addition, the University was already\u000a      collecting important outcomes data into the Birmingham home closures\u000a      process, and was therefore able to draw on original research findings as\u000a      well as a detailed knowledge of policy and practice in order to produce\u000a      the subsequent guide. The guidance was made publically available in June\u000a      2011\u000a      (www.birmingham.ac.uk\/news\/latest\/2011\/06\/08JuneCareReport.aspx).\u000a    The former President of the national Association of Directors of Adult\u000a      Social Services is clear that the research, and the guide in particular,\u000a      was of great benefit through the process. For him, it not only `proved\u000a        crucial during negotiations with government and with Southern Cross\u000a      [and] helped to ensure a smooth handover to new providers without\u000a      the major upheavals that might otherwise have occurred', but it aided his\u000a      work with the media `helping [him] to summarise the evidence base and\u000a      explain what [ADASS] were doing to protect the older people involved'. The\u000a      findings were also used by ADASS and others in their negotiations with\u000a      Southern Cross and its landlords to make sure that no homes closed quickly\u000a      (given a key finding about the importance of time and space to plan\u000a      closures well and work at the pace of individual older people). Eventually\u000a      all homes were transferred to alternative providers without any older\u000a      people being forced to leave their home.\u000a    In addition to this, the guide itself received exclusive coverage from The\u000a        Guardian (source 2), as well as being featured by ITV News, The\u000a        Telegraph, the Today programme and a range of other outlets. The\u000a      lead author, Professor Jon Glasby, was subsequently invited to a private\u000a      briefing with journalists at the BBC to help them understand the\u000a      implications of long-term care funding &#8212; speaking alongside the chair of\u000a      the Social Policy Association and Andrew Dilnot (author of the recent\u000a      Dilnot review on the funding of adult social care and now Chair of the UK\u000a      Statistics Authority).\u000a    The impact is ongoing as closures continue around the country. More\u000a      recently (in early 2013), Glasby worked with Surrey County Council to\u000a      develop their revised Community and Care Home Provider Closure Protocol.\u000a      The Council drew on the Birmingham good practice guidance and evaluations.\u000a      They are clear that the documents were `vital...in shaping and defining\u000a        SCC's protocol and in particular formed the basis of the chapter on\u000a      best practice, which was to be applied to all potential closure scenarios'\u000a      (source 3). By July 2013, the protocol was already `in full use by\u000a        practitioners' and part of Surrey's core training.\u000a    In summary, the research contributed to the design of effective local\u000a      policies and procedures, helped to ensure that local practice was safe for\u000a      frail older people and contributed to national policy, public and media\u000a      debates about care home closures in the wake of the Southern Cross\u000a      scandal.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research into what is believed to be one of the largest care home\u000a      closures programmes in Europe had three key impacts in terms of:\u000a    \u000a      Helping to design the initial closure process at local level\u000a      Evaluating outcomes of the subsequent closures to ensure that\u000a          local policy and practice were safe (for frail older people in\u000a          potentially very vulnerable situations)\u000a\u000a      Producing national guidance for all English Councils on managing care\u000a        home closures and contributing to local\/national planning and a\u000a          change in public opinion regarding care home closure in the wake of\u000a          the Southern Cross scandal.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Research output:\u000a    \u000aR1) Le Mesurier, N. and Littlechild, R.

Following longstanding\u000a      debates, the Council had decided to close all local authority care homes\u000a      for older people, reassessing and resettling all current service users.\u000a      Given Birmingham's size and the existence of a large in-house sector, this\u000a      was believed to be the largest home closure process in Europe.\u000a    Before embarking on this process, Birmingham City Council commissioned\u000a      the University's Institute of Applied Social Studies to produce a review\u000a      of the literature on care home closures and an extensive review of local\u000a      authority guidelines. This found that there was very little empirical\u000a      evidence on the process or impact of care home closures and that there\u000a      were few, if any, reliable benchmarks against which to evaluate the\u000a      Council's closure programme. The Council therefore modelled its approach\u000a      directly on the more general good practice and key themes identified by\u000a      the reviewers (see R1 below).\u000a    Subsequently, researchers in the Health Services Management Centre were\u000a      commissioned to undertake a three year real-time evaluation of this major\u000a      service reconfiguration (2008 - 2011, R2). This was specifically designed\u000a      to feed back to the City Council part way through the closure process so\u000a      that changes could be made if any negative outcomes were found for older\u000a      residents. In the event, the study found positive outcomes for those older\u000a      people who took part and identified a series of key ingredients of this\u000a      success. This led the Council to continue its initial approach &#8212; but with\u000a      crucial external assurance that the approach adopted to such a sensitive\u000a      area of policy and practice was as robust as possible.\u000a    Following publication and dissemination of the evaluation report, in 2011\u000a      researchers at HSMC were commissioned by the national Association of\u000a      Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) to produce a national guide to\u000a      best practice when supporting older people during residential care\u000a      closures. This was published in conjunction with the Social Care Institute\u000a      for Excellence (R3). The guide was distributed by ADASS to all 345 local\u000a      authorities in England, who at the time were involved in planning for the\u000a      potential closure of the Southern Cross chain of care homes (which had\u000a      around 31,000 beds across the country) and taking stock of other potential\u000a      independent sector closures stimulated by this crisis. In addition to the\u000a      emerging data from the Birmingham evaluation, the guide included a review\u000a      of the literature and interviews with social care leaders with prior\u000a      experience of home closures. While the received wisdom was that closures\u000a      could lead to negative outcomes, the findings of the additional research\u000a      undertaken for this guide, combined with the evaluation data, revealed\u000a      that care home closures, if well managed, could be implemented without\u000a      making things worse for residents. This was a crucial component of\u000a      national negotiations between ADASS, the government, Southern Cross and\u000a      the administrator, contributing to a smooth transition and minimal\u000a      disruption for the older people and families affected.\u000a    Research in the Birmingham study and subsequent guide was conducted by\u000a      the following key researchers at the University of Birmingham: Professor\u000a      Jon Glasby (Professor of Health and Social Care); Dr Suzanne Robinson\u000a      (Lecturer, Health Services Management Centre, 2004-2012) and Dr Kerry\u000a      Allen (Research Fellow then Lecturer, Health Services Management Centre).\u000a      The initial literature review was produced by Rosemary Littlechild (Senior\u000a      Lecturer) and Nick Le Mesurier (Honorary Research Fellow, 2007-2010) at\u000a      Institute of Applied Social Studies, University of Birmingham.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38873","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    i.

For example, an\u000a        additional dementia advisor\u000a        and dementia outreach support were commissioned from Alzheimer's\u000a        Society;\u000a\u000a      Lack of clear information for people newly diagnosed with dementia was\u000a        a key project finding.\u000a        Co-researchers were involved in the development of information packs\u000a        tailored at the needs of\u000a        people newly diagnosed with dementia; \u000a\u000a      The findings informed decisions about the role of Mental Health\u000a        Support Re-ablement Team; \u000a\u000a      The findings were used in the training of social workers and\u000a        re-ablement staff.\u000a\u000a    \u000a    Leicester (sources 3 and 4):\u000a    \u000a      The project findings directly informed the adult social care strategy\u000a        (`Adult Social Care Vision,\u000a        Priorities and Delivery Summary').\u000a      The findings triggered or supported a number of developments that\u000a        directly address issues\u000a        identified by participants. For example, positive experiences of\u000a        re-ablement shared by\u000a        participants were used to support the expansion of the service so that\u000a        it now works with all\u000a        people discharged from hospital;\u000a      The Local Authority has developed the role of health and social care\u000a        co-ordinators to provide a\u000a        better linkage between in-patient and community services;\u000a    \u000a    Manchester:\u000a    \u000a      A report of findings and recommendations presented to senior managers\u000a        at Manchester City\u000a        Council's (MCC) Adults Health and Well-Being Directorate (28.02.12) was\u000a        approved and work\u000a        is underway to realise these plans;\u000a      Work is ongoing with patient engagement leads across the three acute\u000a        hospital trusts to\u000a        identify funding, resources and an engagement plan. Medical consultants\u000a        and GPs are\u000a        particularly keen on using customer stories to inform learning;\u000a      Plans were presented and agreed at three Clinical Commissioning\u000a        Groups.\u000a    \u000a    Gloucestershire\u000a    \u000a      The findings were presented to a range of statutory and voluntary\u000a        organisations and services\u000a        and used to identify priorities.

Enhanced the knowledge and practice at national and\u000a          local levels\u000a    Key national players from organisations including Department of Health\u000a      (David Oliver), Care\u000a      Quality Commission, King's Fund, Royal College of Nursing, College of\u000a      Social Work (Mark Ivory)\u000a      and Age UK (Clive Newton), attended a final seminar at which they\u000a      discussed how the findings will\u000a      inform policy and developments in these national organisations. Key\u000a      individuals were interviewed\u000a      about their views on the significance of the project (sources 5 and 6).\u000a      David Oliver, former\u000a      National Clinical Director for Older People, Department of Health, has\u000a      drawn on the project findings\u000a      in his work to improve the care of older people, including in a\u000a      presentation to the King's Fund and\u000a      in his blog (source 7).\u000a    The College of Social Work invited the research team to produce a summary\u000a      for its Social\u000a        Work Matters online magazine and lead an online debate (sources 8\u000a      and 9). The College's online\u000a      material is a well-publicised and easily accessible resource for social\u000a      work practitioners so this is\u000a      an effective mechanism for achieving impact at the level of practice.\u000a    iii. Developed approaches that researchers and service\u000a          commissioners and providers can\u000a          employ to involve marginalised older people in research and service\u000a          development and\u000a          promoted the citizenship of older people through their participation\u000a          as co-researchers\u000a    The project has had significant impact in enhancing methods and processes\u000a      for engaging\u000a      marginalised older people in research and service development.\u000a      Co-researchers made a DVD of\u000a      their experiences of participating in the project (source 10); this has\u000a      been shown at national and\u000a      international conferences attended by academics, service managers and\u000a      practitioners and it is also\u000a      available as a teaching resource to health and social work students.\u000a    Members of the project team collaborated with Involve, a national\u000a      advisory group that supports\u000a      public involvement in NHS, public health and social care research &#8212; to run\u000a      an ESRC Festival of\u000a      Social Science seminar on participatory research approaches. Participants\u000a      included\u000a      representatives of statutory and third sector organisations who were\u000a      engaged in or interested in\u000a      promoting the involvement of older people in service development and\/or\u000a      evaluation. Involve have\u000a      utilised the learning about strategies and tools for involving older\u000a      people in their own work, use the\u000a      project as a case study of positive practice in service user involvement\u000a      in research, and include a\u000a      link to the resource on their Developing Training and Support resource\u000a      pages (source 11 and 12).\u000a    The involvement of older people, including the co-researchers, has\u000a      developed further within\u000a      the local organisations. In Leicester, drawing on the co-research model, a\u000a      Patient Feedback\u000a      Volunteer role was developed, with service users and local community\u000a      members recruited to\u000a      support patients giving feedback about their hospital experience. In\u000a      Manchester, an evaluation of\u000a      older people's experiences of the single assessment process was led by\u000a      some of the co-researchers.\u000a      This adapted the methods and tools used in the transitions project,\u000a      including the\u000a      narrative interview approach. The Manchester City Council Programme\u000a      Manager for Integrated\u000a      Community Provision and a member of the research team have collaborated to\u000a      design an\u000a      infrastructure and training programme for co-researchers to embed this as\u000a      a permanent local\u000a      resource.\u000a    Evaluation with co-researchers demonstrated that they derived\u000a      considerable personal and\u000a      social benefits from participating in the project. These included gains in\u000a      skills and confidence,\u000a      feelings of satisfaction that they were `making a difference', and new\u000a      social contacts and activity.\u000a      One co-researcher was invited to take part in a national reference group.\u000a      Co-researchers in\u000a      Manchester and Leicester are involved in further research and\/or training\u000a      for these local authorities\u000a      while co-researchers in Solihull teach social work students about\u000a      participatory research and trainee\u000a      doctors about experiences of caring for someone with dementia.\u000a    iv. Enhanced strategies for supporting practitioners and\u000a          service providers to access and\u000a          utilise research findings.\u000a    Older co-researchers were centrally involved in the feedback events in\u000a      each site, `giving voice' to\u000a      participant experiences by selecting and reading out interview excerpts.\u000a      Evaluation from the\u000a      feedback events indicated that this was a powerful way of bringing the\u000a      findings to life and\u000a      harnessing the interest and commitment to change of relevant stakeholders.\u000a    Two of the researchers obtained funding for follow-on work with social\u000a      work and social care\u000a      practitioners in the Solihull site. This involved the academic and\u000a      co-researchers working with small\u000a      groups of practitioners to help them identify ways they could apply key\u000a      messages from the project\u000a      into their daily practice. The practitioners formulated action plans to\u000a      take into practice and these\u000a      were evaluated at a subsequent workshop. Managers were involved in taking\u000a      forward issues that\u000a      required action at an organisational level.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The project:\u000a    \u000a      Achieved positive changes in local health and social care policy and\u000a        practice that directly\u000a          responded to the concerns and experiences of older people;\u000a      \u000aEnhanced the knowledge and practice of practitioners and policy\u000a          makers, at national and\u000a        local levels, about the experiences of older people and carers of moving\u000a        across service\u000a        boundaries (\"transitions\");\u000a      \u000aDeveloped approaches that researchers and service commissioners and\u000a          providers can\u000a          employ to 1) involve marginalised older people in research and\u000a        service development and 2)\u000a        promote the citizenship of older people through their participation as\u000a        co-researchers;\u000a      \u000aMade the research findings accessible to practitioners and\u000a        service providers through\u000a        feedback events and workshops.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Research Outputs:\u000a    \u000aR1) Ellins, J., Glasby, J. , Tanner, D., McIver, S., Davidson, D.,\u000a      Littlechild, R., Snelling, I., Miller, R.,\u000a      Hall, K., Spence, K. and Co-researchers (2012) Understanding and\u000a        improving transitions of\u000a        older people: a user and carer centred approach, Birmingham:\u000a      University of Birmingham\u000a      [available: http:\/\/www.netscc.ac.uk\/hsdr\/files\/project\/SDO_FR_08-1809-228_V01.pdf]\u000a    \u000a\u000aR2) Tanner, D.

The lead\u000a      researcher and project\u000a      manager was Dr. Jo Ellins and Prof. Jon Glasby was Chief Investigator.\u000a      Other team members\u000a      were Deborah Davidson, Kelly Hall, Rosemary Littlechild, Dr. Shirley\u000a      McIver, Robin Miller, Ian\u000a      Snelling, Katie Spence and Denise Tanner.\u000a    The research comprised two interrelated stages:\u000a    \u000a      Obtaining `rich' in-depth data about the care transition experiences\u000a        of older people and carers\u000a        across four locations in England. Three locations explored older\u000a        people's experiences of\u000a        hospital admission and discharge and one examined the experiences of\u000a        older people with\u000a        dementia of moving into or between dementia services. The project was\u000a        keen to elicit the\u000a        experiences of more marginalised older people. One site focussed on\u000a        older people from South\u000a        Asian communities while another worked with people with dementia. In\u000a        total 75 older people\u000a        were interviewed across the four locations, including 50 older service\u000a        users and 25 older\u000a        carers. Two interviews were carried out with most participants, with\u000a        approximately six months\u000a        between interviews.\u000a      Each location worked in close partnership with a key voluntary and\u000a        statutory sector\u000a        organisation to promote ownership of the findings and plan for these\u000a        being taken forward in\u000a        policy and practice within the localities. A local feedback event was\u000a        held in each area.\u000a    \u000a    The first key finding was the significance of social and psychological\u000a      needs arising from transition.\u000a      In particular, the research highlighted that older people and their carers\u000a      need to `feel orientated in a\u000a      foreign land'. Key factors influencing their experience were: clear and\u000a      consistent communication\u000a      with a person they could trust; being recognised and valued as a person by\u000a      service providers;\u000a      informal support networks being valued and involved; and services adopting\u000a      a planned and\u000a      proactive approach that recognised older people's ongoing and changing\u000a      needs (see R1 and R2\u000a      below).\u000a    The second main insight of the research was that carefully designed\u000a      participatory methods and\u000a      processes can facilitate highly effective service reviews. The study found\u000a      that it is possible to\u000a      engage traditionally marginalised older people, including people with\u000a      dementia, throughout the\u000a      research process and that their involvement had most impact in the data\u000a      collection and\u000a      dissemination phases of the study. This gives legitimacy to participatory\u000a      initiatives and offers\u000a      pointers about both methods of involvement and processes that may achieve\u000a      greatest impact (R3).\u000a    This finding is exemplified by the research team's approach. A\u000a      co-research approach was integral\u000a      to the project. In each location older co-researchers who had themselves\u000a      experienced a recent\u000a      care transition were recruited and trained in social research methods.\u000a      They participated in every\u000a      phase of the research, including planning the research methods, carrying\u000a      out interviews jointly with\u000a      the lead researcher, analysing the data, reporting back the findings to\u000a      local areas and contributing\u000a      to the `All Sites Days' (see below). A local advisory group comprising\u000a      voluntary and statutory sector\u000a      agencies, lead researcher and co-researchers was established in each area.\u000a      In addition, there was\u000a      a national advisory group of individuals with lead roles in organisations\u000a      concerned with older\u000a      people and\/or health and social care transitions. Four `All Site Days'\u000a      were held during the course of\u000a      the project when local organisations and the national advisory group met\u000a      together to review\u000a      progress and findings. An evaluation of the participatory approach was\u000a      carried out involving\u000a      qualitative interviews and focus groups with all key stakeholders involved\u000a      in the study.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38972","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    &#8226; Shaping the Care Bill\u000a    The Care Bill, currently passing through Parliament, is a significant\u000a      part of `the most comprehensive overhaul since 1948 [of the] care and\u000a      support system' (http:\/\/caringforourfuture.dh.gov.uk\/).\u000a      Our research findings influenced policy debate and directly shaped key\u000a      elements of this legislation.\u000a    Our governance report argued that making SABs a legal requirement would\u000a      help to improve safeguarding governance. DH accepted the recommendation,\u000a      announcing in May 2011 that establishing a SAB would become a legal\u000a      requirement for all local authorities in England. The research evidence on\u000a      the value of such legislation was given as the grounds for this decision,\u000a      with our then-unpublished report cited [see Section 5, C1]. Our\u000a      recommendation also influenced the Law Commission's review of\u000a      adult-social-care law, which called for statutory boards [C2, C3]. Our\u000a      research also evaluated Board configurations, exploring different models\u000a      without specifying any single one for universal adoption. DH has said that\u000a      this `played a major part in informing our thinking' on how prescriptive\u000a      the legislation should be about SAB membership and chairing arrangements,\u000a      leading them to allow a strong degree of flexibility to reflect local\u000a      circumstances [C4]. The overview of current Board practices was used by DH\u000a      in evaluating the feasibility of the SAB reform proposals, informing and\u000a      being directly cited in the impact assessments accompanying the Care Bill\u000a      [C5, C6].\u000a    Our self-neglect report led the Law Commission to recommend that\u000a      self-neglect should be expressly included within the new duty on local\u000a      authorities to investigate cases of abuse and neglect [C2]. The government\u000a      accepted the need to address self-neglect and will do so in the linked\u000a      Code of Practice, in direct response to the issues highlighted by the\u000a      research [C3].\u000a    &#8226; Stimulating changes to the governance arrangements of SABs\u000a    The research has also had wide impact on local governance arrangements.\u000a      The template developed in our governance report to benchmark best practice\u000a      in safeguarding governance was itself used by the DH in setting principles\u000a      against which SABs are required to assess their arrangements [C1]. The\u000a      template was used by chairs of 30 SABs to benchmark their arrangements in\u000a      two national events on 15 February 2011 and 22 February 2011, organised by\u000a      the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Adult\u000a      Social Services (ADASS) [C7]. Four SABs invited the researchers to work\u000a      directly with their whole board. In Camden, for example, the research\u000a      served as the basis for a review of SAB arrangements and led to the\u000a      restructuring of sub-groups (January 2013), the adoption of independent\u000a      chairing arrangements (April 2013) and revision of the communications\u000a      strategy (July 2013) [C7, C8]. In Oxfordshire, the research-based workshop\u000a      on 8 June 2012 `helped the board to consider its structure', `helped\u000a      tremendously in establishing greater clarity about the role of the board'\u000a      and `directly influenced the business plan' and future priorities [C9].\u000a      The governance report informed the ADASS Adult Safeguarding Network in\u000a      preparing guidance for all Directors of local authorities in England and\u000a      was directly cited in that document [C10].\u000a    &#8226; Influencing procedures, practice and workforce development\u000a        strategies in self-neglect work\u000a    Some authorities participating in development workshops on self-neglect\u000a      [see Section 2] reported subsequently changing their systems or practices.\u000a      For example, an event for the Camden SAB on 21 June 2012 highlighted gaps\u000a      in services and inter-agency systems and facilitated the identification of\u000a      solutions. Camden have since trialled and established a `high-risk panel'\u000a      to manage self-neglect cases which, with 35 referrals by July 2013, `has\u000a      been very successful in building networks and reducing risk' [C7, C8].\u000a      High-risk panels have also been established by Brighton and Hove, East\u000a      Sussex and West Sussex, accompanied by a tiered, multi-agency training\u000a      strategy on self-neglect, with content shaped by the research: `The\u000a      published research has been particularly informative in shaping the need\u000a      for successful learning intervention' [C7]. West Sussex drew on the\u000a      research in developing its own guidance to staff [C11]. Wirral NHS\u000a      Foundation Trust changed its approach to mental-capacity assessment as a\u000a      result of our findings [C7]. The national organisation Research in\u000a      Practice for Adults included in its current work-plan the development of a\u000a      practice tool based on our research, to support evidence-informed practice\u000a      by its local authority members [C7].\u000a    We have ensured, too, that the research implications are addressed at\u000a      individual practitioner level. Every practice development event involves\u000a      action planning for personal and organisational change. Social workers,\u000a      health professionals, team leaders and safeguarding leads in many\u000a      localities have set targets for their own personal practice development,\u000a      in locations as diverse as Brighton and Hove, Buckinghamshire, East\u000a      Sussex, Liverpool, Merton, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Oxfordshire,\u000a      Reading, Sutton and York. The research has been described by the DH, as a\u000a      result of the expert seminars they have run, as `exceptionally\u000a      well-received' [C4].\u000a    Finally, benefits for service-users are emerging; one example is from a\u000a      hospital-based safeguarding lead:\u000a    I just wanted to let you know that your presentation ... may already be\u000a      having an impact on people who are self-neglecting. I had a call yesterday\u000a      about an elderly couple who are living in very unsafe surroundings and are\u000a      really struggling, but have declined all interventions. I have asked\u000a      social services to review their decision about (mental) capacity and have\u000a      directed them to your research findings. I am hopeful that they will now\u000a      at least engage in a conversation about how we help to minimise the risks\u000a      to this very vulnerable couple [C7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research has had significant impact in three key areas:\u000a    \u000a      shaping the Care Bill 2013: it influenced the Law Commission's\u000a        recommendations on legal reform and directly shaped key elements of the\u000a        legislation;\u000a      stimulating changes to the governance arrangements of Safeguarding\u000a        Adults Boards (SABs): it produced a benchmarking template for SABs,\u000a        informed guidance to Directors, and led to strengthened SAB governance\u000a        arrangements;\u000a      influencing procedures, practice and workforce development strategies\u000a        in self-neglect work: supporting new multi-agency procedures in\u000a        localities, and providing an evidence base that has improved capacity\u000a        assessment and approaches to intervention, to the benefit of\u000a        service-users.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Sussex\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sussex (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sussex","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007806}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1 Braye, S., Orr, D. and Preston-Shoot, M.

This work led us to recommend that the new duty on a\u000a      local authority to investigate cases of abuse and neglect should apply\u000a      expressly to cases of self-neglect. The Government has taken this\u000a      recommendation into account in the resulting Care Bill, which was\u000a      introduced into Parliament earlier this year. Whilst the Bill does not\u000a      include an express reference to self-neglect, the Government has agreed to\u000a      clarify this matter in the code of practice, which is due to be published\u000a      in 2014'.\u000a    C4 Senior Policy Manager, Adult Safeguarding, Department of\u000a      Health: `The research was particularly helpful in informing how\u000a      prescriptive the legislation should be...

It comprised two studies: first, effective governance for\u000a      Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs) and, second, self-neglect within\u000a      safeguarding arrangements. Braye has been Professor of Social Work at\u000a      Sussex since 1 April 2005; Orr was initially a Research Fellow (February\u000a      2010) and became a Lecturer on 18 July 2011.\u000a    &#8226; Effective governance for SABs\u000a    The significance of adult safeguarding is increasingly recognised; the UK\u000a        Study of Abuse and Neglect of Older People Prevalence Survey Report\u000a      (O'Keefe et al. 2007) estimates that 4 per cent of over-65s are\u000a      subjected to abuse and neglect each year. Existing guidance (No Secrets,\u000a      DH, 2000) encouraged but did not require the establishment of multi-agency\u000a      SABs. Our study explored the strategic goals, structures, membership,\u000a      networks, functions and accountability of SABs and made recommendations to\u000a      government on SAB governance arrangements. It gathered data from a\u000a      systematic literature review, 5 workshops with senior managers and\u000a      safeguarding specialists, 5 key informant interviews, and detailed\u000a      documentation from 47 Boards. It revealed the diversity of practice\u000a      between boards and identified barriers to effective SAB governance. We\u000a      developed a benchmarking template from these findings, providing detailed\u000a      standards for SAB performance review. We also recommended legislating for\u000a      statutory SABs in order to facilitate participation and commitment by\u000a      different agencies, and to set consistent standards.\u000a    &#8226; Self-neglect\u000a    Because safeguarding's remit currently only covers actions or omissions\u000a      by a third party, it is often unclear where risk from self-neglect\u000a      fits; health and social-care workers thus lack clarity on assessment and\u000a      intervention pathways. These cases are frequently complex, involving\u000a      ethical dilemmas between promoting autonomy and fulfilling a duty of care.\u000a      Our research systematically reviewed the international literature and drew\u000a      on the above-mentioned interviews and workshops (plus a practitioner\u000a      workshop) to determine how self-neglect practice could be improved. It\u000a      found that SABs mostly excluded self-neglect from their remit,\u000a      highlighting the need for alternative multi-agency processes. The findings\u000a      illustrated the diversity of contributing factors to self-neglect, and\u000a      showed that the complex nature of the capacity for autonomous\u000a      decision-making is not always adequately addressed in practice. Our\u000a      research evidence provided guidance on effective assessment and\u000a      intervention, multi-agency information-sharing and risk management.\u000a    Findings from both studies were presented through a range of media,\u000a      including SCIE reports [see Section 3, R1, R2], journal articles [R3, R4]\u000a      and online videos feeding live, online, webinars (e.g. https:\/\/knowledgehub.local.gov.uk\/group\/adultsafeguardingcommunityofpractice\/forum\/-\/message_boards\/message\/6943054).\u000aThey\u000a      have stimulated overwhelming interest; the researchers have delivered 16\u000a      invited national conference plenaries and 5 international conference\u000a      papers (2 invited), and participated by invitation in 4 DH expert panels\u000a      and 17 policy\/practice development workshops, involving approximately 45\u000a      local authorities and their interagency safeguarding networks.\u000a    The high profile which this work gained led to a sector skills council\u000a      Skills for Care (SfC) research commission for Sussex to investigate\u000a      social-care workforce-development needs on self-neglect (Braye and Orr, 15\u000a      January 2013 to 30 April 2013) [R5], a national consultation by SfC (https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/s\/sfc_self_neglect),\u000a      and a further DH research commission from Sussex to identify best practice\u000a      in self-neglect, including the first-ever England study of service-users'\u000a      perspectives (Braye and Orr, 1 March 2013 to 30 November 2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39766","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Influencing practitioners and practice developments: Practitioners\u000a      from statutory and voluntary sectors (occupational therapists (OTs),\u000a      social workers and voluntary sector workers) involved in the research and\u000a      knowledge exchange have been impacted directly through experience of\u000a      working with older people, exposure to research findings, and opportunity\u000a      for reflection provided through the KE approach. Commenting on how this\u000a      had made a difference, one voluntary sector practitioner contrasted this\u000a      `REAL' involvement with more familiar `tokenism' (source 5.1).\u000a      Practitioners have adopted the learning resources in their own\u000a      organisations across West and East Sussex as well as in Brighton. An\u000a      Operations Manager in OT claimed that they are `invaluable to our\u000a      organisation as it is an area that is relatively underdeveloped and I have\u000a      had difficulty finding suitable material' (5.2). Between January\u000a      2013, when the resources were launched at Age UK headquarters, and July\u000a      2013, the six films (5.3) were accessed a total of 486 times and the\u000a      accompanying handbook downloaded 696 times; 100 DVD versions have been\u000a      distributed.\u000a    The local Age UK research partner has described how the research has\u000a      benefited the development of professional practice, service delivery and\u000a      enabled the organisation to raise its profile. Findings and learning\u000a      resources are being used in staff training, impacting on its capacity to\u000a      contribute to local planning regarding older people's services, and to\u000a      national consultations and campaigns &#8212; for example on dignity and\u000a      safeguarding (5.4). Research is also impacting on practice via its uptake\u000a      in professional education courses. There is evidence of use in social work\u000a      education in, for example Nottingham and Cambridge, psychologists training\u000a      in NHS Wales and in nurse training in New Zealand (5.5). Website evidence\u000a      shows that, during the impact period, the learning resources had been\u000a      accessed in 31 countries.\u000a    Enhancing older people's participation: The well-being research\u000a      has been acclaimed as `exemplary' by Age UK nationally (5.6) in terms of\u000a      university\/Age UK collaboration and of working with older people in\u000a      research and development. More locally, research findings and innovations\u000a      in ways of working with older people are being drawn on directly in\u000a      developing Brighton and Hove Council's bid to become a World Health\u000a      Organisation (WHO) Age Friendly City; a series of `age-friendly'\u000a      indicators, based on the research, have been developed to be used in\u000a      assessing the council's progress towards the WHO criteria (5.7). In the\u000a      wider Sussex area, the Chair of the Meridian Mature Citizen's Forum\u000a      (Newhaven) states that participation in the Growing Older, Being Heard\u000a      research `gave the Forum confidence and a sense of purpose' regarding\u000a      involvement in debates with local authorities about the need for community\u000a      transport. Councillors from three towns affected by poor transport\u000a      connections now meet regularly to further this agenda (5.8).\u000a    Older people themselves, working as co-researchers, have benefited\u000a      directly through their participation in the research, developing skills\u000a      and confidence and an enhanced sense of pride in what they can achieve,\u000a      particularly regarding advocating for the rights and interests of older\u000a      people, as Film 6 in the film-based learning resources demonstrates (5.3).\u000a      Their enhanced confidence and skills are further reflected in a booklet\u000a      they produced &#8212; As time goes by: thoughts on well-being in\u000a        later years, which offers guidance to older people on strategies for\u000a      well-being (5.9); 2,000 copies of this publication have been distributed\u000a      via community organisations. Co-researchers have also presented research\u000a      findings at local and national conferences and seminars, including:\u000a      INVOLVE (a leading charity promoting participation); ESRC Social Science\u000a      Festival seminar, `Looking at Ageing Differently'; Civil Service\u000a      Pensioners Association, and; Older People's Council, Brighton and Hove.\u000a    Informing policy and stimulating policy debate: Research has\u000a      informed local policy, as indicated in Brighton and Hove's Joint Strategic\u000a      Needs Assessment, where sections on both `Ageing well' and `Older\u000a      People-Social Care' make explicit reference to the importance of the\u000a      well-being research and the centrality of relationships to well-being in\u000a      older age (5.10).\u000a    The research has stimulated policy debate by challenging assumptions\u000a      about well-being. The well-being project report was launched at an event\u000a      in April 2012 attended by 70 older people, practitioners from local\u000a      statutory and voluntary agencies, Age UK and the Social Care Institute for\u000a      Excellence; 62% of feedback forms said the research had added to\u000a      understanding or changed attendees' points of view. Responses from those\u000a      attending the national launch of learning resources were enthusiastic\u000a      about the ethic of care framework and, at a local launch in April 2013,\u000a      discussion reflected the contribution this research is making to debate on\u000a      independence versus relationality and the implications of this for policy.\u000a    International impacts: Researchers seeking to develop similar ways\u000a      of working with older people in research, policy and practice development\u000a      from the Netherlands, France, Spain and Australia are drawing directly on\u000a      this research. The professor of Client Participation in Elderly Care at\u000a      the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam has confirmed that the\u000a      research and collaboration with researchers has fed directly into their\u000a      own methods of working with older people, stating that: `We developed and\u000a      evaluated a work format for participation of older people in long-term\u000a      care institutions in which an ethic of care approach is central (enhancing\u000a      relational empowerment amongst older people) and building more equal\u000a      collaboration between older people and professionals'. They are also using\u000a      the learning resources directly in their collaborative work with older\u000a      people and practitioners, building explicitly on the approach developed at\u000a      UoB (5.11).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research into participative practice and well-being with older people has\u000a      contributed directly to the development and application of an ethic of\u000a      care in policy and service delivery, as well as to practices in older\u000a      people's participation, locally, nationally and internationally. The\u000a      research has directly impacted on practitioners and practice developments\u000a      in services for older people, with learning resources (co-designed with\u000a      practitioners and older people) being used in professional education and\u000a      training across the UK and in New Zealand. An innovative participatory\u000a      methodology has both enhanced older people's participation locally and\u000a      been adopted more widely by university community research collaborators\u000a      working to enhance older people's citizenship and well-being (eg in\u000a      Netherlands).

Policy has focused on\u000a      promoting choice and independence for individual older people, in order to\u000a      reduce their dependencies on health and care services in later life. At\u000a      the same time, there has been continuing evidence of abuse and poor\u000a      practice in the care of older people within hospitals and residential\u000a      homes. The research underpinning the impact claimed in this case study\u000a      builds on a body of work conducted over 20 years within the School of\u000a      Applied Social Science (SASS) on user involvement, public participation,\u000a      partnership working, older people and care. BARNES' appointment in 2006\u000a      strategically enhanced this work, further developing her internationally\u000a      recognised research on public participation, participatory research\u000a      methods and care ethics. Since the early 1990s, BARNES' work has included\u000a      DH-funded evaluation of user involvement in community care, ESRC-funded\u000a      case study research on public participation, and action research involving\u000a      frail older people in user panels. Her reflective monograph [reference\u000a      3.1] and journal article [3.2] provide a sustained critique of the\u000a      individualised, choice-based approaches dominating policy and practice.\u000a      The monograph develops an alternative relational approach, based in an\u000a      ethic of care that is applied to social care practice, social policies and\u000a      the practice of deliberative policymaking. This internationally recognised\u000a      scholarship is reflected in, and has been further developed through, a\u000a      series of participative research projects involving older people as\u000a      co-researchers to understand well-being in later life [3.3, 3.4, 3.5].\u000a    Participatory research and translation: The interaction of\u000a      reflective work and scholarship with participatory empirical research has\u000a      been central to developing the involvement of older people in the impacts\u000a      of the research on practice, and critical policy thinking. Four key\u000a      participative research projects involving MURRAY and WARD (see section 3\u000a      for funding details) underpin the impact:\u000a    Growing Older, Being Heard: Exploring older people's experience of\u000a      and motivations for taking part in groups giving a voice to older people\u000a      in local policy, drew attention to the significance of older activists'\u000a      sense of themselves as community members with commitments to achieving\u000a      broad rather than self-interested outcomes from their participation. It\u000a      identified key issues on which older people wanted to campaign,\u000a      highlighted negative experiences in relation to perceived influence and\u000a      suggested how this might be improved [3.3].\u000a    Cheers!? Older People and Alcohol Use: A project with older people\u000a      and a local partnership of service providers that produced a journal paper\u000a      co-authored with a community partner distinguishing different models of\u000a      alcohol use and emphasised the importance of relational practices in\u000a      response [3.4].\u000a    Older People and Well-being: Research with older people in\u000a      partnership with a local Age UK office explored what well-being means to\u000a      older people and how it is generated, challenging dominant views of\u000a      well-being as relating to independence and the exercise of choice. It\u000a      demonstrated how relationships with family, friends, service providers,\u000a      strangers and places are strongly implicated in the maintenance of\u000a      well-being in old age. In a publication co-authored with a community\u000a      partner, the research de-coupled the `health and well-being' link\u000a      indicating that poor treatment rather than poor health may be more\u000a      damaging [3.5].\u000a    Knowledge Exchange with Older People and an Ethic of Care\u000a      (KEOPEC): The UoB undertook translational research using ESRC funding with\u000a      local Age UK partners and partners in the statutory and voluntary sectors\u000a      and applied the findings from the Older People and Well-being\u000a      project to the development of learning resources, which are being used to\u000a      embed an ethic of care approach to service delivery in the care of older\u000a      people.\u000a    Overall, this body of research has identified how diverse relationships\u000a      are necessary to achieve individual and collective well-being for older\u000a      people. The research's collaborative and participatory methods have\u000a      contributed to the development and application of an ethic of care,\u000a      designed to promote good care as a value in policy and service delivery,\u000a      as well as to influence practice in older people's participation and\u000a      involvement.The participatory methods were a key process underpinning the\u000a      impacts as the research was co-designed and undertaken with older people\u000a      as co-researchers. The latest project (KEOPEC) adopted a `cascade model'\u000a      to Knowledge Exchange in which intense participatory work involving\u000a      researchers, practitioners and older people had a direct influence on\u000a      those taking part. The participants then shared this experience and\u000a      learning in their educational and service provider settings, further\u000a      influencing a wider network of practitioners and practices, ensuring that\u000a      the learning resources produced in the KE are used nationally and\u000a      internationally to stimulate impact.\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Marian Barnes:\u000a          Professor of Social Policy (Sept 2006&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Lesley Murray:\u000a          Lecturer (July 2007&#8211;Feb 2012), Senior Lecturer (Mar 2012&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Elizabeth Ward:\u000a          Research Officer (Sept 2007&#8211;Sept 2008), Research Fellow (Oct\u000a            2008&#8211;Feb 2012), Senior Research Fellow (Mar 2012&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39767","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Influencing policy in local authorities and the NHS: CMIT was\u000a      central to the development of local policies on alcohol community safety\u000a      and domestic violence, and contributed directly to the UK's first local\u000a      LGBT specific housing policy (source 5.1). The Housing Strategy Manager\u000a      for Brighton and Hove City Council has stated that `CMIT was of\u000a      fundamental use in helping us to develop the city's LGBT People's Housing\u000a      Strategy 2009. The research provided a vivid insight into the lives and\u000a      experiences of the city's LGBT communities that we would not have got from\u000a      our traditional engagement routes' (5.2). The Housing Strategy is also\u000a      being used by LGBT community groups in Irish LGBT community organisations\u000a      &#8212; GLEN and BeLong (5.3).\u000a    The extent of need identified in the findings on mental health from CMIT\u000a      and the Suicide Distress research led to the incorporation of these\u000a      recommendations into Brighton and Hove's first Suicide Prevention\u000a      Strategy, 2008-11 (5.4) and the NHS Brighton and Hove's Single Equality\u000a      and Human Rights Scheme 2010-13 (5.5). The two studies underpin a chapter\u000a      on LGBT community resilience in the Director of Public Health's annual\u000a      report 2010 (5.6), where the researchers are cited as contributors, and\u000a      the research underpins the sexual orientation section of Brighton and Hove\u000a      Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA 2013). The localised and\u000a      participative nature of the research was key to making these initiatives\u000a      possible, and the opportunities to develop ground breaking research that\u000a      challenged key stereotypes, and engaged politicians and heads of service,\u000a      were imperative to the impacts achieved in the local area.\u000a    Influencing national policy in the UK: The research findings and\u000a      approaches have had impacts at both national and international level. CMIT\u000a      findings informed the Department of Health (UK) policy document Be\u000a        active, be healthy, showing why LGBT people might be deterred from\u000a      physical activity (5.7). The recommendations of CMIT were taken up by the\u000a      UK Drug Policy Commission (5.8) and used in the UK Cabinet Office's Call\u000a        to end violence against women and children (5.9). The\u000a      Equalities and Human Rights Commission Report uses this research to\u000a      address homophobia in the UK and inform work on ageing and older people\u000a      (5.11). The research was also used as part of the evidence base for the\u000a      companion report for the national LGBT Outcomes Framework that makes\u000a      recommendations for action at local, regional and national levels (5.11).\u000a    Influencing policy in Australia: The research has informed\u000a      directly policy developments in Australia through the National LGBTI\u000a      Health Alliance, responsible for a range of organisations and individuals\u000a      from across Australia that work in a variety of ways to improve the health\u000a      and well-being of LGBT communities. In particular, insights from UoB's\u000a      participative approach to research and service developments has been used\u000a      in the Alliance's pathways to inclusion for mental health and suicide\u000a      prevention services, and health services document (5.12). In the state of\u000a      Victoria, the GLVH, an LGBTI health and well-being policy resource unit,\u000a      has used the research in its guide to GLBTI Inclusive practice for health\u000a      and human services (5.13). The Brighton &amp; Hove LGBT Housing Strategy\u000a      is being used to aid advocacy and wellbeing in gay and lesbian health by\u000a      the charity Open Door in Australia.\u000a    Reshaping mental health services: The evidence for the need for\u000a      LGBT-specific services underpinned the establishment of MindOut as an\u000a      independent charity, informed practitioner debate and reshaped local\u000a      service delivery to meet the needs of LGBT people. Findings on mental\u000a      health from the two studies were used by MindOut to help secure its future\u000a      by two successful bids to the Big Lottery and local health funding (total\u000a      funding: &#163;485k) to provide appropriate services for LGBT people with\u000a      mental health issues and expand their delivery (5.14). The research\u000a      findings supported the development of a senior practitioner at MindOut.\u000a      Allsorts an LGBT youth project changed their practice through the\u000a      appointment of a new mental health worker (5.14).\u000a    In Brighton and Hove, the local NHS and City Council used the research to\u000a      indicate levels of local LGBT need and to provide a rationale for targeted\u000a      community mental health services. CMIT data around mental health issues\u000a      informed equality and diversity training for members of the GP Clinical\u000a      Commissioning Group and GP Practice Managers (5.15). As a result of\u000a      findings from CMIT, the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has stated\u000a      that it `decided to respond proactively in reaching out to LGB and T\u000a      people to raise awareness of mental health issues' and that they `are\u000a      listening to what local LGB and T people want and showing how we provide\u000a      it by demonstrating that our services are LGBT affirmative' (5.16). CMIT\u000a      research recommendations resulted in two LGBT workers being recruited to\u000a      RISE, a charity that supports women and families affected by domestic\u000a      abuse, benefiting gay men and trans people who might otherwise be excluded\u000a      from services focused on women\/heterosexual men (5.17).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2003, participatory action research in Brighton and Hove has\u000a      identified the specific health and well-being needs of LGBT people in\u000a      mental health, safety, housing, drugs and alcohol. The research changed\u000a      local and national policy and reshaped services to reflect the diverse\u000a      needs and experiences of LGBT communities. In the UK, the research\u000a      influenced policy resulting in the first local LGBT housing strategy and\u000a      the first suicide strategy in Brighton that centralises LGBT people. The\u000a      research played a key role in ensuring the survival of the only LGBT\u000a      mental health charity in the UK.

JOHNSON and\u000a      BROWNE have driven the development of an internationally recognised strand\u000a      of community based research on understanding and transforming LGBT health\u000a      and well-being needs. The research has been closely linked to the funding\u000a      and collaborative approach to impact of the university's Community\u000a      University Partnership Programme (CUPP) (REF3a). Two studies were\u000a      developed in Brighton and Hove, the `gay capital' of the UK: Count Me In\u000a      Too (CMIT) (2005-2010) led by BROWNE, and the LGBT Suicidal Distress (SD)\u000a      project (2005- 2008) led by JOHNSON. The latter built on JOHNSON's\u000a      collaborative research published in King et al. [reference 3.1] that first\u000a      revealed the link between discrimination, poor mental health,\u000a      psychological well-being and suicidal distress.\u000a    The findings of the two projects have produced new knowledge about mental\u000a      health, health, housing and community safety needs of LGBT communities\u000a      that challenges narrow approaches to dealing with LGBT safety,\u000a      demonstrating a need for a broader social policy framework that moves away\u000a      from constrained views of abuse and hate crime [3.2, 3.3, 3.4]. This has\u000a      also advanced the process of doing research with LGBT collectives [3.2,\u000a      3.5], and the need for wider inclusion approaches to enable trans- and\u000a      bisexual individuals and organisations greater access to influence service\u000a      provision in line with their specific health and well-being needs [3.2,\u000a      3.4].The original aim of CMIT was to investigate marginalisation amongst\u000a      LGBT people in Brighton and Hove, providing a full-scale needs assessment\u000a      of LGBT people in this area. This project established that 73% had\u000a      experienced some form of discrimination in the previous five years and 50%\u000a      had experienced some form of mental health issue [3.3]. It also\u000a      distinguished between and established the need for both LGBT specific\u000a      and LGBT sensitive services [3.2, 3.4].\u000a    JOHNSON developed the insights produced in the original King et al. study\u000a      [3.1] via one of the only qualitative studies of experiences of LGBT\u000a      suicidal distress in existence [3.4] and showed that this is linked to a\u000a      range of negative experiences of identity formation and discriminatory\u000a      practices, including family, school, work, and bullying. Methodologically,\u000a      the original use of participatory action research (PAR) in the field of\u000a      LGBT health and well-being brought together communities, service\u000a      providers, politicians, practitioners and academics in the design,\u000a      delivery and dissemination to co-produce research that worked for positive\u000a      social change. This research engaged a range of LGBT voices, particularly\u000a      trans and bi people [3.2, 3.3, 3.4], and identified that the way LGBT\u000a      people are represented in research is itself an important site for social\u000a      transformation if a history of marginalisation and oppression is to be\u000a      overcome [3.5]\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          \u000aKey researchers:\u000a          \u000a          \u000a          \u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Katherine Browne:\u000a          Lecturer (Jan 2003&#8211;Aug 2004), Senior Lecturer (Sept 2004&#8211;Aug\u000a            2010), Reader (Sept 2010&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Paul Faulkner:\u000a          Research Assistant (Sept 2005&#8211;Sept 2006).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Katherine Johnson:\u000a          Lecturer (Aug 2002&#8211;Aug 2003), Senior Lecturer (Sept 2003&#8211;July\u000a            2006), Principal Lecturer (Aug 2006&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Jason Lim:\u000a          Research Fellow (Nov 2007&#8211;Jan 2010), Lecturer (Jan 2013&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39768","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Shaping national policy debate in the UK: The influence of RT on\u000a      policy debate is evidenced by it being commended by the Chief Medical\u000a      Officer (UK), who included details of Brighton's RT research and training\u000a      in support of the case for a resilience-based approach to child\u000a      development, in her 2012 Annual Report (Volume 2: Giving Children the\u000a        Best Start in Life and Building Resilience) (source 5.1). Resources,\u000a      learning and critique have been fed in to key national policy teams via\u000a      internal briefings for senior civil servants and ministers; meetings with\u000a      Department of Health leads for children's mental health, public health;\u000a      and briefings for the new Health Visiting national implementation\u000a      programme and the Department for Education policy lead for Vulnerable\u000a      Children and Mental Health. In 2012-13 HART was an advisor to the big\u000a      lottery steering committee involved in decisions on how to set up and fund\u000a      future resilience projects totalling &#163;75m. The impact of the research on\u000a      policy debate is further evidenced by its inclusion as one of just five\u000a      case study projects in an ESRC film in 2011 on the value and impact of\u000a      social sciences (over 1,000 views by July 2013) (5.2) and as a key case\u000a      study of public engagement promoted by the National Co-ordinating Centre\u000a      for Public Engagement (5.3).\u000a    International impacts on the delivery of children's services: In\u000a      Sweden (5.4) over 500 professionals have now been trained in the RT\u000a      approach. In west Gothenburg an outpatient-based healthcare section of\u000a      the Swedish National Health services has started a Resilience\u000a      Framework-based project involving community services, working with 30\u000a      schools, preschools, social services and all healthcare services for the\u000a      10,000 children and youth living in the area. RT has been taken up by\u000a      children's services in Crete, where the research led to children's\u000a      services becoming more community-focused and has influenced the ways a\u000a      diagnostic centre designs, delivers and evaluates its interventions (5.5).\u000a    Adoption of RT by local authorities: Research-based RT training\u000a      has been delivered to a total of 10 local authorities, often as part of\u000a      their children's workforce training programmes, leading them to adopt and\u000a      adapt RT. Examples include:\u000a    Brighton &amp; Hove: RT is used as part of a common set of skills\u000a      now required by everyone working or volunteering with children, young\u000a      people and families (5.6).\u000a    London Borough of Newham: resilience research has changed the\u000a      development of the outcomes framework used to commission and evaluate\u000a      services (5.7).\u000a    West Sussex County Council: the Targeted Mental Health in Schools\u000a      (TaMHS) Project placed the RT framework at the `heart' of its project,\u000a      claiming that it `gets results' (5.8).\u000a    Newport: a consortium of local authority and community\u000a      organisations, led by Mind in Wales, was trained and supported in RT by\u000a      the Brighton team, contributing directly to earlier interventions, which\u000a      is in turn is reducing pressure on other services (5.9).\u000a    Adoption of RT by charities: The RT model has impacted on local\u000a      and national charities who have adopted it in a range of contexts.\u000a      Examples include:\u000a    Mind: Training and workshops delivered directly to national and\u000a      local representatives of the mental health charity Mind, resulted in the\u000a      national office issuing a briefing on RT to the network of 150 local\u000a      Minds. This informed local ways of working in relation to the mental\u000a      health resilience of local communities in response to crises including the\u000a      impact of serious floods in Denbighshire in 2012 and huge stock losses in\u000a      the farming community in 2013. This led Mind to look at wider issues of\u000a      community response which led to the exploration of partnership working\u000a      with the Red Cross concerning links with emergency response teams (5.9)\u000a    Right Here Art Project: a consortium (comprising Sussex Central\u000a      YMCA, Mind, Brighton &amp; Hove Children and Family Services and NHS\u000a      Brighton &amp;Hove) built its mental health project for 16-25 year olds\u000a      around the RT model from design, through facilitation to evaluation\u000a      (5.10). Amaze: a charity working with over 1500 parents of\u000a      disabled children, has included RT in their strategic developments (5.11).\u000a    Impacts on co-researchers: The co-production process that is core\u000a      to the research involved 120 community partners and service users. For\u000a      many of them their roles in the wider community have changed as they\u000a      become involved in networks, producing learning material and delivering RT\u000a      training. The research has been made available through the systematic\u000a      co-production of books, training materials (5.12) and the provision of\u000a      workshops. The initial book Resilient Therapy was strongly\u000a      endorsed by the Director of Well-being Projects at Mental Health Today\u000a      for the way in which it `recognises and validates the role of front line\u000a      staff and the experiences of young people... to support and empower a\u000a      workforce' (5.13). A collaborative book, Helping Children with Complex\u000a        Needs Bounce Back, produced with a community partner, had sold 1,500\u000a      copies to July 2013 (5.12). The Insider's Guide, a manual-based\u000a      course for parents, designed and co-facilitated by parent carers and\u000a      practitioners, has been used in training in ten local authorities (see\u000a      above). Other co-produced handbooks and guides include one produced by and\u000a      for Kinship Carers and another aimed at parents of young people\u000a      with mental ill health and produced by Experience in Mind (a group\u000a      of young volunteers with complex mental health challenges). These are made\u000a      available free of charge via websites and are used directly by benefitting\u000a      children and families (5.12).\u000a    BoingBoing is a novel community interest company established by\u000a      HART and community partners in 2010 in response to the demand for\u000a      research-based resilience training. It developed an RT Learning Programme\u000a      that is delivered regularly to practitioners and students in social work,\u000a      medicine, nursing, teaching, psychology, occupational therapy and\u000a      inclusive arts, reaching over 4000 individuals to July 2013 (5.12). Since\u000a      the end 2011, the BoingBoing website has had 89,770 hits, and\u000a      46,155 downloads of presentations and materials from the repository. Its\u000a      Twitter presence has 2,120 followers (all figures July 2013).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Collaborative research with practitioners, parents and young people has\u000a      led to the development of Resilient Therapy (RT) a new approach to\u000a      building resilience in disadvantaged families. The new RT model has been\u000a      adopted as part of service provision by 10 local authorities in England,\u000a      and by local and national charities including the mental health charity\u000a      Mind in Wales. There is evidence that the model is changing high level\u000a      national policy debate in the UK.

The resulting research that underpins\u000a      this case study is based on a series of studies led by Prof. Angie HART\u000a      and colleagues in collaboration with practitioners in Adult and Children's\u000a      Services, parents of children with complex needs and young people\u000a      themselves. Early research [references 3.1, 3.2] demonstrated that\u000a      conventional therapeutic approaches, in which expert practitioners\u000a      administer therapies to service users needed to be challenged. New\u000a      approaches were identified for developing resilience based on a synthesis\u000a      of propositional knowledge, practice and personal experiences. A review of\u000a      over 1,000 publications on resilience was then undertaken and, drawing on\u000a      previous research on inequalities [3.3], a critique was made of the\u000a      dominant paradigm that understood resilience as residing solely in\u000a      individuals, rather than arising from person-environment interactions.\u000a      Insights from this work were then developed, through a process of\u000a      co-production with practitioners, parents and young people, into a new\u000a      approach to resilience building, known as Resilient Therapy (RT). A new RT\u000a      model was developed that defined a set of principles (accepting,\u000a      commitment, enlisting, conserving) to guide practice and created a\u000a      framework articulating 42 ways of making `resilient moves' with and for\u000a      children, young people and families [3.4].\u000a    Development and translation: After the initial development of a\u000a      new RT model, a series of translational research and development projects\u000a      were undertaken that generated new knowledge that was integrated with the\u000a      development of RT in practice. The research undertaken by community and\u000a      academic collaborators initiated and evaluated the adoption and adaptation\u000a      of RT across a range of practice arenas including adoption, fostering,\u000a      mental health and learning disabilities, (see section 3 for list of HEFCE,\u000a      ESRC and AHRC funded projects). These resulted in the generation of new\u000a      knowledge about not only context-specific resilience-building, but about\u000a      the importance of co-production for enabling this to be realised. For\u000a      example, an AHRC-funded study involving resilience-building with\u000a      disadvantaged young people and with young people facing mental health\u000a      challenges showed that the RT approach can be used in the context of\u000a      community arts practice so that young people themselves develop resilience\u000a      through participation in visual arts practice. A later study developed a\u000a      consultative systematic review approach that for use by parents and\u000a      practitioners wishing to scrutinise the resilience evidence base\u000a      concerning its relevance for young people with learning difficulties and\u000a      other complex needs. The review identifies different types of resilience\u000a      intervention &#8212; for example, school-based interventions [3.5] and provides\u000a      further support for the widespread adoption of the resilience framework\u000a      developed during earlier research [3.4]. Additional research in this\u000a      development phase evaluated the Communities of Practice (CoPs) approach to\u000a      co-production used in adapting the RT model for different use contexts.\u000a      The evaluation identified the potential offered by the CoPs approach for\u000a      challenging conventional boundaries and hierarchies between service\u000a      `providers' and `users' and for mobilising new forms of knowledge to meet\u000a      social need.

The research had a\u000d\u000a      highly significant series of impacts in the wake of the Cumbria 2010\u000d\u000a      shootings, when the Home Affairs Select Committee undertook an inquiry\u000d\u000a      into firearms control. The resulting Firearms control &#8212; Third\u000d\u000a        Report of Session 2010-2011, Volume 1 by the Home Affairs Committee (HC\u000d\u000a        447-I, 2010) accepted and went on to present to Government specific\u000d\u000a      recommendations made in evidence by SQUIRES on the misuse of firearms\u000d\u000a      (5.2).\u000d\u000a    These included evidence in relation to:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      legal weapon possession and domestic violence (para. 21)\u000d\u000a      the impact of the 1998 handgun ban (para. 29)\u000d\u000a      the role of `readily convertible' weapons and firearms supply (para.\u000d\u000a        123)\u000d\u000a      anti-social behaviour and the misuse of air weapons (para. 129).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In particular, the Committee noted that: `On the basis of data\u000d\u000a        submitted to the Cullen Inquiry, and that collected more recently by\u000d\u000a        Professor Squires and the Gun Control Network, we are concerned about\u000d\u000a        the use of legal firearms in domestic incidents, often linked to\u000d\u000a        domestic violence'. The Committee also accepted the suggestion by\u000d\u000a      SQUIRES that policing agencies `...make generalised data about the\u000d\u000a        illegal gun market available to academics and policymakers more widely\u000d\u000a        ... in recognition of the contribution that such individuals can make to\u000d\u000a        crime reduction' (5.2). A number of these recommendations were\u000d\u000a      specifically accepted by Government (The Government Response to the 3rd\u000d\u000a        Report from the Home Affairs Committee session 2010-11, HC 447 -\u000d\u000a        Firearms Control (HC 8155, September 2011) (5.3). Consequently, in\u000d\u000a      new legislation, Part 8 of the current Anti-social Behaviour, Crime\u000d\u000a        and Policing Bill (sections 100 and 101) (5.4) now includes\u000d\u000a      recommendations relating to a proposed new offence of `illegal firearm\u000d\u000a        possession with intent to supply', which traces back to the evidence\u000d\u000a      presented by SQUIRES to the Home Affairs Committee (5.2: section 4, from\u000d\u000a      para. 105). Subsequently, the Home Office incorporated proposals relating\u000d\u000a      to records of domestic violence risk and spousal counter-signatories into\u000d\u000a      the revised Guide on Firearms Licensing Law 2013 (5.5) distributed\u000d\u000a      to all police forces to guide their determination of firearm licence\u000d\u000a      applications and renewals based on earlier evidence on firearms in the\u000d\u000a      home and domestic violence risks presented to the Home Affairs Committee\u000d\u000a      (5.2).\u000d\u000a    Policy impact &#8212; CCTV surveillance: During 2009 to 2010, SQUIRES\u000d\u000a      joined a working party of the European Forum for Urban Safety (EFUS)\u000d\u000a      commissioned to develop a protocol of evidence-led guidance and good\u000d\u000a      practice in CCTV policy development. The EU Charter for the Democratic\u000d\u000a        Use of Video-Surveillance, based on the protocol, was launched in\u000d\u000a      Rotterdam, becoming formally adopted in Lisbon in November 2010, being\u000d\u000a      incorporated and implemented by the EFUS network of EU cities and regions.\u000d\u000a      Evidence presented by SQUIRES to EFUS provided clarification and offered\u000d\u000a      useful lessons for improving the process of policy transfer in this area\u000d\u000a      to inform the effective integration of CCTV into the criminal justice and\u000d\u000a      security infrastructures. This evidence demonstrated the importance of\u000d\u000a      effective evaluation in crime prevention development, pointing out the\u000d\u000a      need for appropriate accountability safeguards and realistic expectations\u000d\u000a      of CCTV development. It thereby directly underpinned the EU Citizens'\u000d\u000a      Charter on CCTV surveillance. SQUIRES' article on evaluating CCTV\u000d\u000a      effectiveness was published by EFUS in a companion volume to the new EU\u000d\u000a      Charter Citizens, Cities and Video-Surveillance (EFUS, 2010) (5.6,\u000d\u000a      5.7).\u000d\u000a    Policy discourse and public debate: SQUIRES' interventions as a\u000d\u000a      public academic integrating academic and policy research have had a\u000d\u000a      subsequent impact on policy and public discourse and debate in the field\u000d\u000a      of youth and public safety. SQUIRES was part of a team in 2008 developing\u000d\u000a      an evidence base on gangs and weapon use for the Street Weapons Commission\u000d\u000a      chaired by Cherie Blair for Channel 4 (5.8). The commission recommended\u000d\u000a      elements of a `violence reduction strategy', which became a central\u000d\u000a      feature of government policy. SQUIRES worked in 2009 for the Children's\u000d\u000a      Commissioner for England in a meta-analysis (5.9) examining the use of\u000d\u000a      weapons by children and young people, drawing attention to the fact that\u000d\u000a      this phenomenon was closely associated with disadvantage, social\u000d\u000a      exclusion, victimisation and disrupted childhoods and was not, therefore,\u000d\u000a      amenable to enforcement-led strategies alone (5.9), as reflected in the\u000d\u000a      cross-governmental Violence Reduction Strategy of 2011. Following\u000d\u000a      appointment in 2013 to the UK Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO)\u000a      National Independent Advisory Group on Criminal Use of Firearms, SQUIRES\u000d\u000a      continues to contribute to policy and practice debates in these areas.\u000d\u000a    As a leading European commentator on firearms controls, SQUIRES\u000d\u000a      participates frequently in public debate, including an international\u000d\u000a      symposium on firearms and self-defence in Washington, DC and a live TV\u000d\u000a      debate (5.10) in March 2012 with Wayne La Pierre, Executive Vice-President\u000d\u000a      for the US National Rifle Association concerning the UN Arms Trade Treaty,\u000d\u000a      to which the NRA was vehemently opposed but which the US Obama\u000d\u000a      Administration backed. Following the shooting tragedy at Sandy Hook\u000d\u000a      School, Connecticut (14 December, 2012) SQUIRES participated in over 40\u000d\u000a      national and international TV news, radio, press and online interviews and\u000d\u000a      commentaries. His work has also been cited as an `invaluable resource' in\u000d\u000a      the Vice-Presidential Special Commission Report Reducing Gun Violence\u000d\u000a        in America (Webster and Vernick, eds. 2013) (5.11).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Criminology research by SQUIRES has changed national and European policy,\u000d\u000a      practice and debate on public safety.

For 20 years, SQUIRES'\u000d\u000a      research has engaged directly with the community and inter-agency agendas\u000d\u000a      in policing, firearms control and public safety, demonstrating that\u000d\u000a      improvements in accountability, research evidence and effective evaluation\u000d\u000a      are critical issues for gun control and (CCTV) surveillance policy.\u000d\u000a      SQUIRES is a leading public academic in the field so that research, public\u000d\u000a      and political engagement and impact are mutually reinforcing.

The research, therefore, involves SQUIRES acting as a\u000d\u000a      public academic presenting research critically to a range of audiences and\u000d\u000a      medias, some of whom are often resistant to acknowledging the implications\u000d\u000a      of research findings. This process, however, ensures a mutually enhancing\u000d\u000a      interaction between research and impact so that SQUIRES' research activity\u000d\u000a      is informed by regular exchanges with users which build trust between\u000d\u000a      researcher and user. An active dissemination profile (see section 4) was\u000d\u000a      reflected in one of the Guardian's `academic expert profiles':\u000d\u000a      `Squires is the country's most-quoted academic expert on gun crime, whose\u000d\u000a      voice has been much in demand over recent months, not least by the BBC'.\u000d\u000a    Firearms violence and control: This research has involved two\u000d\u000a      interrelated strands, both concerned with public safety, which use similar\u000d\u000a      conceptual frameworks, research methods and approaches to impact. The\u000d\u000a      first strand concerns gun violence and control and a series of initial\u000d\u000a      publications that followed SQUIRES' seminal work in 2000 [reference 3.1],\u000d\u000a      which revealed the inadequacy of narrow solutions to gun control and the\u000d\u000a      need for more evidence-led and culturally sensitive approaches to gun\u000d\u000a      control that adjusted to changing patterns in firearm misuse over time.\u000d\u000a      Following participation in an EPSRC-funded `research sandpit' Tackling\u000d\u000a        Gun Violence in 2005, SQUIRES was involved in three major\u000d\u000a      EPSRC-funded collaborative, interdisciplinary research projects\u000d\u000a      (EP\/D078725\/1 MAGNET 1; EP\/E003826\/1 DNA Receptors with Nanotags on\u000d\u000a      Cartridges and EP\/D078326\/1 MEDUSA). These illustrated the changing\u000d\u000a      profile of gun-involved violence in the UK's most deprived areas and\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the complex mixed economy of illegal firearms in gang\u000d\u000a      networks. Several highly influential publications followed, including the\u000d\u000a      definitive Centre for Crime and Justice Studies' Gun Crime: A Review\u000d\u000a        of Evidence and Policy [3.2], along with publications on illegal\u000d\u000a      firearm supply, community `weaponisation', gangs and youth violence [3.3]\u000d\u000a      and policing gang and gun cultures, and addressing firearm misuse [3.4].\u000d\u000a      This research informed SQUIRES' written and oral evidence to the Home\u000d\u000a      Affairs Select Committee on Firearms Controls (2010), which has\u000d\u000a      subsequently influenced both legislation and policy guidance (see section\u000d\u000a      4).\u000d\u000a    The effects of CCTV surveillance: The second research strand\u000d\u000a      focuses on the effects of the implementation of (police and local\u000d\u000a      authority) CCTV surveillance cameras in urban areas. SQUIRES led eight\u000d\u000a      separate CCTV camera-installation impact research and evaluation projects\u000d\u000a      (with &#163;115k funding from public-sector organisations) between 1994 and\u000d\u000a      2002 in London and the South East. The findings featured in the Welsh and\u000d\u000a      Farrington `Crime prevention effects of closed circuit television' review\u000d\u000a      conducted for the Home Office (see Home Office Research Study, no.252,\u000d\u000a      London: HMSO). SQUIRES was subsequently invited to provide research\u000d\u000a      evidence to a European Forum for Urban Safety (EFUS) initiative developing\u000d\u000a      effective and accountable CCTV-based crime prevention systems in the EU.\u000d\u000a      This involved a series of research visits to cities in EU-member states\u000d\u000a      and the findings, along with those from the earlier research, were\u000d\u000a      published in a paper on `learning the lessons' of successful CCTV\u000d\u000a      implementation and evaluation [3.5]. The research impacted on EFUS policy\u000d\u000a      and practice (see section 4), as it had identified unrealistic\u000d\u000a      expectations regarding CCTV impacts upon crime and disorder and\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the role of appropriate evaluation in effective, democratic\u000d\u000a      and accountable public policy development.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Peter Squires:\u000d\u000a          Lecturer (Apr 1986-Aug 1991), Senior Lecturer (Sept\u000d\u000a            1991-July 1998), Principal Lecturer (Aug 1998-June 2000), Reader\u000d\u000a            (June 2000-June 2005) Professor of Criminology and Public Policy\u000d\u000a            (July 2005-to date).\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39824","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Parliamentary and Policy Impact\u000a    Diedrichs' and colleagues' research outlined in Section 2 has\u000a      informed and influenced national political and parliamentary debate and\u000a      policy in the UK. Based on the research output, Diedrichs was\u000a      invited as the only academic to join the steering group for the UK\u000a      Campaign for Body Confidence in 2011. The Campaign at the time was led by\u000a      MP Jo Swinson (now Minister for Women and Equalities), and the steering\u000a      group involves politicians, charities, and community organisations who\u000a      meet regularly in the British Houses of Parliament. It aims to promote\u000a      positive body image by influencing the advertising, fashion, beauty and\u000a      media industries, and the Government. In her capacity as a steering-group\u000a      member, Diedrichs shaped political and public debate by directly\u000a      embedding her research into the proceedings of the Campaign.\u000a    A specific example of the research's impact on parliamentary debate\u000a      occurred in 2011, when the Campaign steering group decided to lobby\u000a      Government for the inclusion of body image interventions in school\u000a      curricula. Diedrichs was invited to submit her research examining\u000a      school-based interventions to the steering committee. This ultimately led\u000a      to Swinson making a submission in Parliament about the need to teach\u000a      evidence-based body image interventions in schools, including cognitive\u000a      dissonance approaches that were evaluated in Diedrichs' research\u000a      (see Source 1).\u000a    In Parliament, Swinson stated: \"The University of the West of\u000a        England's Centre for Appearance Research will soon publish its\u000a        evaluation of different types of body image lessons. It suggests that\u000a        the technique of cognitive dissonance&#8212;putting young people in a position\u000a        in which they challenge the stereotypical, ideal body themselves&#8212;is the\u000a        most successful in changing attitudes, and can reduce body\u000a        dissatisfaction and the likelihood of developing eating disorders...I\u000a        hope that the Government will conclude that body image should be taught\u000a        in all schools...we need to encourage teachers and schools to use those\u000a        resources by sharing best practice..\" (see Source 1)\u000a    Diedrichs was subsequently invited as the only academic to\u000a      co-author the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image's 2012 Reflections\u000a        on Body Image Report (Source 2). This report summarised the results\u000a      of a national parliamentary inquiry into the causes and consequences of\u000a      body image concerns. It included policy recommendations for evidence-based\u000a      body image interventions to be made mandatory in schools nationally. Diedrichs'\u000a      research directly informed, and was cited as providing the underpinning\u000a      evidence for, these policy recommendations.\u000a    Industry Impact\u000a    Diedrichs' research has influenced industry strategy for\u000a      developing and delivering evidence-based body image interventions\u000a      globally. It directly informed and shaped the social mission agenda for\u000a      Unilever's leading personal care brand Dove (see Source 3), which delivers\u000a      body image educational interventions to girls in over 20 countries.\u000a      Between 2008 and 2013, Dove has delivered body image education to 8.7\u000a      million girls worldwide.\u000a    In June 2012, Diedrichs was invited to advise on the re-launch of\u000a      Dove's new psychosocial body image interventions. In relation to their\u000a      educational programs, Dove states that Diedrichs' research has\u000a      been \"instrumental in formulating our approach, development and design\"\u000a      (Source 3). They also say that \"Collectively, these pieces of research\u000a        have influenced Dove's social mission strategy, bringing clarity to the\u000a        evidence base, convincing key business stakeholders of the viability of\u000a        evidence-based approaches and contributing to the evidence underpinning\u000a        the curriculum themes that guide the Dove Self Esteem Project in\u000a        totality...\" (Source 3).\u000a    More specifically, Diedrichs' research has helped Dove to\u000a      identify the most effective school-based programme known to date, which\u000a      they are now launching in at least 20 countries. Highlighting the impact\u000a      of Diedrichs' research, Dove has said that \"Without this\u000a        research, our level of confidence in achieving the tangible impact we\u000a        set out to achieve would be significantly lower...Our choice of school\u000a        intervention to use as a basis of our re-launched program was reinforced\u000a        by the results of a further study of Dr Diedrichs' evaluating a version\u000a        of the recommended program in a younger audience, providing new evidence\u000a        in an area less well understood to date...\" (Source 3).\u000a    Additionally, Diedrichs' research has informed the content of a\u000a      new Dove education intervention that is delivered in partnership with the\u000a      World Association for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. Dove has said \"Dr\u000a        Diedrichs' research has been key to the development of this non-formal\u000a        intervention program. Specifically, her paper evaluating the\u000a        well-regarded `Body Project' with 12-13 year olds in the UK, has\u000a        directly informed the creation of our new youth leader education tools\u000a        which will reach over 3.5 million girls in the next 3 years.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Negative body image affects 60-70% of children and adults in developed\u000a      countries and is recognised as a significant public health issue.

Due to evidence\u000a      that it is associated with multiple physical and psychological health\u000a      problems (e.g. depression, eating disorders, substance misuse) body image\u000a      is recognised as a public health issue. To date, however, there has been a\u000a      lack of empirical evidence on how to best develop brief psycho-social\u000a      interventions that can improve body image among young people.\u000a      Historically, interventions have been delivered by educational\u000a      authorities, community organisations and industry without evidence to\u000a      support their effectiveness. Due to an increasing need for accountability\u000a      and evidence of real and measurable impact, governments, policy makers,\u000a      and industry in Europe, USA, and Australia have called for evidence-based\u000a      information on what they need to do to improve body image and what\u000a      existing interventions work best with children, particularly in education\u000a      settings.\u000a    Staff from UWE's world-renowned Centre for Appearance Research have\u000a      conducted a programme of research that has answered these calls and\u000a      addressed critical gaps in knowledge on effective body image interventions\u000a      in real-world settings.\u000a    The research team at UWE was as follows:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aDr Phillippa Diedrichs (UWE start date 4 January 2010, Research\u000a        Fellow 2010-2011; Senior Research Fellow 2012-present)\u000a      \u000aDr Emma Halliwell (UWE start date 4 January 2004; Lecturer\u000a        2004-2006, Senior Lecturer 2006-present)\u000a      Professor Diana Harcourt (UWE start date 1 September 1994; Research\u000a        Psychologist 1994-1997; PhD Student 1997-2000; Lecturer 2000-2004,\u000a        Senior Lecturer 2004-2006, Reader 2006-2012; Professor 2012-present)\u000a        (submitted to UoA3).\u000a      Professor Nichola Rumsey (UWE start date 1 October 1990; Lecturer\u000a        1990-1992, Senior Lecturer 1992-1997, Reader 1997-2002; Professor\u000a        2002-present) (submitted to UoA3).\u000a    \u000a    This research was conducted by Diedrichs in collaboration with Halliwell,\u000a      Harcourt and Rumsey. It comprised two strands: (1)\u000a      establishing best practice standards for developing interventions that aim\u000a      to improve young people's body image; and (2) developing and evaluating\u000a      the impact of classroom-based body image interventions that have potential\u000a      for dissemination nationally and internationally in primary and secondary\u000a      schools.\u000a    The first strand of research systematically reviewed existing research on\u000a      school-based body image interventions, in turn creating new knowledge by\u000a      establishing which interventions have been most effective to date in\u000a      school settings, and identifying the key elements of effective\u000a      interventions (Diedrichs &amp; Halliwell, 2012; Yager et\u000a        al., 2013a; 2013b). The research identified three interventions that\u000a      were most effective in improving young people's body image, including\u000a      media literacy and cognitive dissonance approaches. It also identified key\u000a      ingredients for intervention success. These included the optimal\u000a      intervention length (2-6 sessions), the type of facilitators who are most\u000a      effective and preferred by participants (female teachers and external\u000a      providers), and the most effective intervention content (activities that\u000a      develop media literacy and skills to resist sociocultural pressures). This\u000a      research collectively established best practice standards and methods for\u000a      evidence-based school body image interventions.\u000a    The second research strand included innovative studies (Halliwell\u000a      &amp; Diedrichs, 2013; Bird et al., 2013), which were the\u000a      first internationally to examine how two existing evidence-based\u000a      interventions for older adolescents (The Body Project and Happy\u000a        Being Me) might be adapted for use with early and pre-adolescents.\u000a      Despite evidence suggesting that body image concerns often develop in\u000a      childhood, the majority of existing research on body image interventions\u000a      has overlooked this age. These UWE studies addressed this gap.

The beneficiaries of these interventions\u000d\u000a      nationally since 2008 include: school pupils (1,620); health, social care\u000d\u000a      and educational professionals (over 1120); arts based practitioners (55);\u000d\u000a      governing bodies (207); and national politicians (30). Sexual health\u000d\u000a      service design was influenced by the voices of these young people and\u000d\u000a      professionals. Our underpinning research informed the Teenage Pregnancy\u000d\u000a      Unit Good Practice Guidelines for arts-based work with children in the\u000d\u000a      care system.

The evaluation evidence is integral to key\u000d\u000a      Soil Association and Garden Organic publications (S4, S5, T2). Commenting\u000d\u000a      on the Soil Association's `Good Food for All' publication, the Director of\u000d\u000a      the Food for Life Partnership (T3, S4) highlights the impact of UWE's\u000d\u000a      research \"This seminal report demonstrating the key impacts of FFLP has\u000d\u000a      formed the evidence base from which we've been able to develop\u000d\u000a      conversations with Public Health commissioners leading to the\u000d\u000a      implementation of locally commissioned FFLP programmes that support the\u000d\u000a      health strategies in local areas.\" Furthermore, the Head of Education,\u000d\u000a      Garden Organic (T5, S5) reported that \"The Department for Environment,\u000d\u000a      Food and Rural Affairs supported a Food Growing in Schools Taskforce which\u000d\u000a      produced a report and 6 key recommendations for helping every school\u000d\u000a      become a food growing school based on the evidence demonstrated in reports\u000d\u000a      like the `Good Food for All' publication\".

Between 2011 and 2012, Professor Orme\u000d\u000a      gave four key national presentations to audiences of policy makers, health\u000d\u000a      and education professionals, practitioners and researchers: (i) BIG\u000d\u000a      Lottery Wellbeing Research Outcomes Conference, Birmingham (March, 2011),\u000d\u000a      ii) Faculty of Public Health (national professional body) conference\u000d\u000a      attended by the Minister for Children and Families (S7) (June, 2011), iii)\u000d\u000a      HRH Prince Charles Royal Commission consultation event (November, 2011),\u000d\u000a      iv) Department for Education National School Food Plan (NSFP) consultation\u000d\u000a      event (November, 2012) (T4, S8). As a result, BIG Lottery were influenced\u000d\u000a      to fund FFLP to the tune of a further &#163;4.6 million in September 2013\u000d\u000a      enabling the programme to extend its reach to additional communities. In\u000d\u000a      addition, our research findings underpinned the development of a new\u000d\u000a      approach that FFLP adopted to commissioning their services to support\u000d\u000a      school food improvement across whole local authorities and school clusters\u000d\u000a      (T3). FFLP have subsequently geared up to put in place measures to embed\u000d\u000a      the programme into a wider range of settings i.e. hospitals, early years,\u000d\u000a      universities, care homes and workplaces (T2). Also, our research helped to\u000d\u000a      shape government public health policy. Former Deputy Director of Soil\u000d\u000a      Association (T2) notes that \"The [UWE] review has provided us with many\u000d\u000a      opportunities to share the evidence with policy makers at the highest\u000d\u000a      level\".

Schools play a pivotal role in promoting the health\u000d\u000a      and well-being of children and their families. Yet many diet, alcohol,\u000d\u000a      drug and sexual health initiatives have been found to have limited\u000d\u000a      effectiveness in school settings. Orme's team researched how why\u000d\u000a      and to what extent the active participation of young people can improve\u000d\u000a      the credibility of health messages and can turn best practice into\u000d\u000a      longer-term action in schools. Since 1999 the team, which leads the field\u000d\u000a      in this area, has produced over 90 academic papers and reports related to\u000d\u000a      this work.\u000d\u000a    The UWE research team includes Judy Orme (Reader in Public Health\u000d\u000a      and later Professor, Public Health and Sustainability, 2011 &#8212; present); Mathew\u000a        Jones (Senior Lecturer, 1998 &#8212; present) and Debra Salmon\u000d\u000a      (Reader in Community Health and later Professor, Community Health, 2010 &#8212;\u000d\u000a      present).\u000d\u000a    Sexual health initiatives in schools\u000d\u000a    The UWE research team led by Professor Salmon evaluated\u000d\u000a      interactive sexual health drama productions in which young people\u000d\u000a      participated as actors, directors or audience members e.g. Myrtle Theatre\u000d\u000a      Company's `Jump' (2005-2006), `Jump Together' (2006) and `City of One'\u000d\u000a      (2008) programmes. The research assessed the ability of the performing\u000d\u000a      arts to improve sexual health and wellbeing of vulnerable young people to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate that these young people at the centre of the Government's\u000d\u000a      Teenage Pregnancy Strategy can be reached via their involvement in\u000d\u000a      interactive sexual health drama (R1).\u000d\u000a    Bristol's high teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection rates\u000d\u000a      amongst young people before 2008 were explained in part by poor access to\u000d\u000a      health services, particularly for vulnerable young people. This resulted\u000d\u000a      in the introduction of the Brook Sexual Health Outreach Service in\u000d\u000a      Schools, an integrated sexual health service (contraception and sexual\u000d\u000a      health) in secondary schools across Bristol for young people 11-18 years.\u000d\u000a      UWE's evaluation (R2) of this service demonstrated that it was successful\u000d\u000a      in improving access across all groups (including those who were hard to\u000d\u000a      reach e.g. boys, low educational achievers), preventing pregnancy, early\u000d\u000a      identification and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and\u000d\u000a      improved sexual health knowledge.\u000d\u000a    Healthier eating in schools\u000d\u000a    School meal take-up has an essential part to play in improving health and\u000d\u000a      wellbeing, diet related problems, behaviour and attainment but in England\u000d\u000a      only 43% of children eat school meals on a daily basis. One third of\u000d\u000a      children leave primary school overweight or obese. In this context, UWE's\u000d\u000a      research on effective strategies for the provision of healthy school food\u000d\u000a      addressed major public policy concerns. UWE's evaluation across England of\u000d\u000a      the Food for Life Partnership programme (FFLP) (2007-11) led by Professor\u000d\u000a      Orme involved pre- and post- cross sectional study of 111 schools,\u000d\u000a      4,600+pupils and 1,000+ parents. The evaluation identified positive health\u000d\u000a      and wellbeing programme outcomes for children and their families i.e.\u000d\u000a      increased take-up of healthy school meals; increased fruit and vegetable\u000d\u000a      growing, cooking, farm visits, and sustainability education activities;\u000d\u000a      healthier eating for children and families; improved school performance\u000d\u000a      and attainment. The findings demonstrated the role of pupil\u000d\u000a      decision-making forums in directing local programme delivery and creating\u000d\u000a      credible messages in school and home settings (R3).

On the strength of it, &#163;200,000 was awarded by NHS Gloucester for\u000d\u000a      art groups reaching approximately 780 patients up to July 2012. The scheme\u000d\u000a      is now embedded in clinical practice, funded by the Clinical Commissioning\u000d\u000a      Group, with up to 60 patients receiving ArtLift `treatment' at any one\u000d\u000a      time (source 1). The lead GP from Walnut Tree Surgery, acknowledges that Daykin's\u000a      research was key to persuading doctors and funders to continue and enlarge\u000d\u000a      on the work. Because of the evaluation, follow-on activities are targeted\u000d\u000a      at groups that benefit the most. A wider debate was started about the\u000d\u000a      importance of art and, `how we need to de-medicalise mild to moderate\u000d\u000a      mental health issues' (source 2). The research is an acknowledged\u000d\u000a      influence on work in other localities, such as Bristol's ArtShine inner\u000d\u000a      city arts on referral scheme (source 3).\u000d\u000a    The Moving On evaluation brought together a multidisciplinary team of\u000d\u000a      clinicians, artists and service users who carried out its key\u000d\u000a      recommendations, securing charitable funds (2009) to establish a\u000d\u000a      participatory arts project at a large Bristol NHS mental health hospital.\u000d\u000a      A poet, a musician and two visual artists each delivered successive\u000d\u000a      residencies for approximately 50 patients drawn from adult acute,\u000d\u000a      rehabilitation and psychiatric intensive care wards, and an older adult\u000d\u000a      unit. These patients recorded music and created permanent artworks that\u000d\u000a      continue to enhance the hospital environment. The team created a toolkit\u000d\u000a      and resources so that therapies staff could continue with the activities\u000d\u000a      once the residencies had finished. The patients also took part in public\u000d\u000a      performances and showcasing events. These reduced stigma, generating new\u000d\u000a      community partnerships for the hospital. Therapies staff gained new\u000d\u000a      creative skills and resources, reporting their practice as invigorated by\u000d\u000a      the project. Senior clinicians and managers observed the positive impacts\u000d\u000a      of the arts process, being persuaded to maintain three artists' employment\u000d\u000a      on an ongoing basis. These impacts are documented in the report,\u000d\u000a      co-authored by Daykin with Barbara Feldtkeller, the Trust's arts\u000d\u000a      psychotherapy research lead (source 4).\u000d\u000a    The Director of Willis Newson acknowledges the significant impact of the\u000d\u000a      KTP research on organisational learning and business development (source\u000d\u000a      5). By generating a framework for arts and health evaluation and a\u000d\u000a      supporting library of tools, it supported the launch of a new consultancy\u000d\u000a      service (source 6) that has evaluated arts and health programmes for NHS\u000d\u000a      and Third Sector organisations, generating new income of &#163;19,977 up to 31\u000d\u000a      July 2013. This has enhanced their reputation and strengthened their\u000d\u000a      eligibility for grant funding, supporting sustainability, with new income\u000d\u000a      of over &#163;140,000 projected for evaluation services over the three years\u000d\u000a      from January 2014.\u000d\u000a    Local impact is acknowledged by LightBox Community Interest Company, a\u000d\u000a      Bristol based arts on referral project providing workshops to promote\u000d\u000a      mental wellbeing. Without the research, `we wouldn't have been able to\u000d\u000a      access the &#163;200,000 funding we were subsequently awarded by BIG Lottery's\u000d\u000a      Reaching Communities Fund' (source 7). The research also, `enabled us to\u000d\u000a      critically appraise out achievements and weaknesses as an organization,\u000d\u000a      and use that knowledge to continually improve how we engage with the\u000d\u000a      public who access our resource' (source 7).\u000d\u000a    National level impact is also evidenced by Making Music, which represents\u000d\u000a      over 3,200 voluntary groups across the UK. The research findings generated\u000d\u000a      a CPD workshop on arts and health evaluation, well attended and received\u000d\u000a      at their national conference in September 2011. Consequently, they were\u000d\u000a      able to successfully launch a `Manifesto for Music and Wellbeing.' The\u000d\u000a      Head of Development acknowledges the significant influence of Daykin's\u000a      research on `the thinking behind many of our recent strategic decisions,\u000d\u000a      and the drafting of funding proposals ... for projects in this important\u000d\u000a      and largely misunderstood area' (source 8).\u000d\u000a    By identifying risks as well as benefits of arts, and linking this with\u000d\u000a      improved evaluation practice, Daykin's research is widely\u000d\u000a      acknowledged as encouraging arts organisations to adopt a more considered\u000d\u000a      approach to their work. This has ensured their sustainability, and has\u000d\u000a      generated wider benefits for the sector, through dissemination by local\u000d\u000a      and national advocacy organisations (source 9). Daykin's research\u000d\u000a      is acknowledged as helping to raise standards and increase effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of arts in health activity across the UK. Over the last five years, it\u000d\u000a      has, `influenced the way in which arts in health work is described, framed\u000d\u000a      and examined.... Over this same period, the field of arts in health ... is\u000d\u000a      much more widely accepted. This is not coincidental. Improved evaluation\u000d\u000a      and a better approach to defining the impact of arts activity on health is\u000d\u000a      a big part of the reason for arts approaches being adopted by clinicians\u000d\u000a      and healthcare providers' (source 10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Norma Daykin's research has improved delivery and evaluation of arts\u000d\u000a    and health programmes for clinical and non clinical populations.

Research undertaken in 2002 at UWE by Norma\u000d\u000a        Daykin (Senior Lecturer 1993-1996, Principal Lecturer 1996-2001,\u000d\u000a      Reader 2001-2006, Professor 2006-present) identified benefits and risks of\u000d\u000a      creativity for professional musicians (ref 1). These can transfer into\u000d\u000a      therapeutic environments, including negative beliefs about creativity that\u000d\u000a      shape inclusion and exclusion. From this followed a study in 2004 with\u000d\u000a      Leslie Bunt, Professor of Music Therapy at UWE, which demonstrated the\u000d\u000a      high value that patients place on expressive creativity as well as the\u000d\u000a      complexities of using arts with vulnerable groups (ref 2).\u000d\u000a    This initial groundwork prompted further research with the UWE research\u000d\u000a      team of Stuart McClean (Lecturer 2000-2004, Senior Lecturer 2004-present),\u000d\u000a      Paul Pilkington (Senior Lecturer 2006-present) and Nick de\u000d\u000a        Viggiani (Lecturer 2001-2002, Senior Lecturer 2002-present) with Daykin.\u000d\u000a      In the evaluation of ArtLift (2008), commissioned by Arts Council England\u000d\u000a      and Gloucestershire County Council (ref 3), Daykin, Pilkington\u000d\u000a      and McClean reviewed an innovative programme of 15 artist residencies in\u000d\u000a      GP and mental healthcare settings across Gloucestershire. The research\u000d\u000a      evidenced benefits, including reduced anxiety and social isolation, of\u000d\u000a      participation in activities such as poetry, ceramics, drawing and\u000d\u000a      painting. The research showed which patients benefitted most, including\u000d\u000a      those with mild to moderate mental health problems and physical conditions\u000d\u000a      such as Parkinson's Disease. The findings included detailed\u000d\u000a      recommendations for improving quantitative and qualitative evaluation\u000d\u000a      practice, highlighting the need for training and support for artists and\u000d\u000a      health practitioners (ref 3).\u000d\u000a    A long-standing partnership with Willis Newson Arts Consultants has\u000d\u000a      generated findings to both areas described above. Daykin led the\u000d\u000a      evaluation of `Moving On', (2005-7), a programme provided by Avon,\u000d\u000a      Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust. The study, commissioned by\u000d\u000a      the Estates and Facilities division of the Department of Health, used\u000d\u000a      qualitative methods to investigate the impact of arts on patients and\u000d\u000a      staff in mental healthcare environments (ref 4). It revealed the role and\u000d\u000a      contribution of healthcare environments in enhancing patient care and\u000d\u000a      staff morale, illuminating best practice in using creative arts to address\u000d\u000a      stigma. The study demonstrated the value of qualitative methods including\u000d\u000a      documentary analysis, interviews, focus groups and arts based methods such\u000d\u000a      as photography (ref 4).\u000d\u000a    Evaluation methods were the focus of an evidence review led by Daykin\u000d\u000a      and de Viggiani, commissioned by Youth Music in 2011. This\u000d\u000a      assessed evaluation practice across a wide range of participatory music\u000d\u000a      making, identifying a strong need for improved methodological\u000d\u000a      understanding and appropriate evaluation tools.

Barter and Berridge acted as expert\u000d\u000a      consultants on the campaign, which ran in February 2010. It included a\u000d\u000a      commissioned short film on teenage relationship abuse which was shown on\u000d\u000a      all major terrestrial and cable TV channels and in cinemas.\u000d\u000a      Awareness-raising advertisements were also placed in a range of teenage\u000d\u000a      magazines and posted in public toilets and schools. A website &#8212; `this is\u000d\u000a      abuse' &#8212; was launched, aimed at raising awareness of this issue for 13 to\u000d\u000a      19 year-olds. The current Government repeated the campaign (&#163;1.5 million)\u000d\u000a      in 2011-2012 and commissioned a new awareness campaign on teenage sexual\u000d\u000a      violence which ran in 2012 and 2013. The total governmental financial\u000d\u000a      commitment to raising awareness around this issue is &#163;4.5 million to date.\u000d\u000a      Barter has acted as an expert consultant on all the campaigns. A quote\u000d\u000a      from the Home Office lead in this area directly acknowledges the research\u000d\u000a      findings' impact:\u000d\u000a    \"In 2009 Home Office Communication and Violent Crime Unit colleagues were\u000d\u000a      working together to consider the need for a Domestic Violence campaign.\u000d\u000a      The NSPCC research `Teen partner violence' published in 2009 backed up the\u000d\u000a      Home Office findings but also found that the attitudes of teenagers were\u000d\u000a      shockingly tolerant of violence in relationships but that many of them had\u000d\u000a      also experienced violence themselves. It was these revealing findings\u000d\u000a        that influenced the Home Office to target teenagers about relationship\u000d\u000a        abuse with the intention of challenging these attitudes and to\u000d\u000a      engage and educate teens before controlling, violent or coercive\u000d\u000a      behaviours became entrenched. The Home Office contacted Dr Christine\u000d\u000a      Barter from Bristol University... to agree to work together to develop a\u000d\u000a      longer term X-Government campaign strategy to this end. The campaign has\u000d\u000a      now been running for 4 years and a Teen Rape prevention campaign was also\u000d\u000a      developed alongside. Dr Barter has consulted with the Home Office on these\u000d\u000a      two campaigns since 2009 and continues to do so\" [a].\u000d\u000a    The Home Office evaluation [b] of the first `this is abuse' campaign in\u000d\u000a      2011 showed it reached 2.9 million young people &#8212; equating to 60% of the\u000d\u000a      13 to 19 year-old target group. The online advertisements were displayed\u000d\u000a      120 million times and over 397,000 young people clicked on the online\u000d\u000a      adverts to access information. Click-through to campaign content from\u000d\u000a      online ads was very high at 33%. The parents' advertisements reached 10.2\u000d\u000a      million people, 47% of the target audience. Over 90% of young people\u000d\u000a      polled felt the campaign had made them think about the issue and\/or\u000d\u000a      encouraged them to challenge abuse in their own or friends' relationships.\u000d\u000a      The domestic violence charity Refuge noticed an increase in the number of\u000d\u000a      calls from young women from the time the campaign started (increasing from\u000d\u000a      an average of 46 per week pre-campaign to 71 per week in the period 15\u000d\u000a      February to 31 March 2010). Anecdotally, during this time the number of\u000d\u000a      calls to the charity Respect rose and Women's Aid reported a substantial\u000d\u000a      increase in traffic on their `Hideout' message board aimed at young\u000d\u000a      people.\u000d\u000a    The Home Office evaluation of the second campaign [c] showed that 540,000\u000d\u000a      web users accessed further information or help during the 2012 activity,\u000d\u000a      providing evidence that &#8212; according to the Home Office assessment &#8212; `the\u000d\u000a      campaign has been effective in delivering intermediate behavioural\u000d\u000a      change'. The website had more hits than any other domestic violence\u000d\u000a      campaign. In 2012, Yahoo had 1,286 question threads relating to the\u000d\u000a      campaign and associated issues.\u000d\u000a    Policy\u000d\u000a    The previous Government's review on the sexualisation of girls and women\u000d\u000a      [d] drew heavily on the research. A section was included specifically on\u000d\u000a      teenage partner violence (chapter 7) and highlighted the research findings\u000d\u000a      and their importance. Barter, who gave evidence to the review, was\u000d\u000a      directly quoted in the report. A statement from the Home Office lead\u000d\u000a      explains the direct impact of the research findings: \"In 2009, I was the\u000d\u000a      Home Office policy lead on the Sexualisation of Young People Review,\u000d\u000a      conducted by Dr Linda Papadopoulos. As part of the research for this\u000d\u000a      review I became aware of the research that the NSPCC (Barter et al 2009)\u000d\u000a      had commissioned on the impact of teenage relationship abuse. Following\u000d\u000a      evidence hearing sessions to discuss this research, a recommendation\u000d\u000a      was...included in the government strategy, Together we can end\u000d\u000a        violence against women and girls (2009). The recommendation was to\u000d\u000a      run a campaign aimed at challenging the attitudes and perceptions that\u000d\u000a      lead to violence within teenage relationships as the first phase in a\u000d\u000a      broader cross-government communications strategy\/campaign\" [e].\u000d\u000a    In response, the Department for Children, Schools and Families Violence\u000d\u000a      against Women and Girls Advisory Group Recommendations and Strategy [f]\u000d\u000a      and Response [g] clearly identified teenage relationship violence as a\u000d\u000a      priority.\u000d\u000a    Keir Starmer QC [h], Director of Public Prosecutions, in a speech on the\u000d\u000a      Crown Prosecution Service and domestic violence, quoted the research to\u000d\u000a      highlight the importance of recognising the problem of intimate violence\u000d\u000a      in young people's relationships. In 2012, the age at which domestic\u000d\u000a      violence can be officially recorded by the Police was reduced from 18 to\u000d\u000a      16 years old. The research findings were widely referenced in the\u000d\u000a      accompanying consultation [i].\u000d\u000a    Practice\u000d\u000a    The Scottish Government commissioned the film Crush in response\u000d\u000a      to the research findings. The film has been shown in schools in Scotland\u000d\u000a      since January 2011, targeting 16 to 18 year-olds. Since August 2011\u000d\u000a      Domestic Abuse Resources and Training for Schools in Scotland (DARTSS) has\u000d\u000a      been including the film in a teaching pack as part of an educational\u000d\u000a      programme for all Scottish schools. Shona Bruce from the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government, who oversaw all aspects of the programme, stated:\u000d\u000a    \"In the Reduce Abuse Project we have used both research reports [1, 3],\u000d\u000a      to influence practice. We carry out work with staff and young people to\u000d\u000a      challenge attitudes and address violence against women, to improve\u000d\u000a      outcomes for local children and young people. We have built the research\u000d\u000a      findings into training of teachers and multi-agency staff on teen\u000d\u000a      relationship abuse, and were recently delivering training to staff in the\u000d\u000a      Looked After and Accommodated Children's (LAAC) field, and were able to\u000d\u000a      use findings from 'Standing on my own two feet' [3] to raise\u000d\u000a      awareness of issues specific to disadvantaged young people.\" [j]\u000d\u000a    A wide range of regional initiatives have been developed in response to\u000d\u000a      the research. For example, in Bristol the Personal, Social and Health\u000d\u000a      Education (PSHE) curriculum manual has been rewritten in the light of the\u000d\u000a      research projects and the Domestic Violence Strategy has identified\u000d\u000a      violence in teenage relationships as a policy and practice priority.\u000d\u000a      Barter has worked alongside a number of young people's organisations to\u000d\u000a      develop resources on the issue.\u000d\u000a    Media\u000d\u000a    The research findings have generated significant media interest. The\u000d\u000a      initial findings (1\/9\/2009-3\/09\/2009) were widely reported. There were\u000d\u000a      articles in five tabloids (average coverage 365 words) and four\u000d\u000a      broadsheets (average coverage 455 words) &#8212; the total number of `first'\u000d\u000a      readerships for the national news outlets was 6,850,000. 36 national and\u000d\u000a      international media websites ran the story, and BBC Online News reported\u000d\u000a      it as the `most read' story. Four international news agencies covered the\u000d\u000a      story. Six national television channels aired it, with a total of 18\u000d\u000a      repeated news items\/bulletins. 12 national radio stations broadcast a\u000d\u000a      total of 42 related news bulletins. In addition, there was regional\u000d\u000a      coverage by 47 local radio stations and 79 local newspapers. Barter has\u000d\u000a      undertaken a wide range of radio interviews, including three BBC Radio 4\u000d\u000a      half-hour interviews aimed at raising awareness of the issue for parents\u000d\u000a      and professionals.\u000d\u000a    There has been substantial additional media coverage following the second\u000d\u000a      report, and the research has been quoted in more than ten subsequent\u000d\u000a      national press stories.\u000d\u000a    In terms of the wider media impact, Barter acted as a consultant for the\u000d\u000a      BBC series Casualty &#8212; which included a four-episode story on a\u000d\u000a      teenage girl's abusive relationship with her boyfriend &#8212; and for a BBC3\u000d\u000a      and BBC Education training pack on teenage partner violence in 2012 aimed\u000d\u000a      at young people. She is currently advising on a one-hour film for the BBC\u000d\u000a      aimed at raising young people's awareness of the problem. She is also\u000d\u000a      acting as a consultant for the Home Office awareness unit, which is\u000d\u000a      currently preparing new resources to accompany the next campaign planned\u000d\u000a      for 2013. This work includes developing a storyline for the TV soap opera\u000d\u000a      Hollyoaks.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted in the School for Policy Studies at the University of\u000d\u000a      Bristol from 2006 inspired the Government to commission a series of\u000d\u000a      carefully targeted awareness campaigns on sexual coercion and violence in\u000d\u000a      teenage relationships.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted\u000d\u000a      with 44 boys and 38 girls aged between 13 and 18 years via a range of\u000d\u000a      agencies and organisations working with disadvantaged young people in\u000d\u000a      south-west England.\u000d\u000a    Main findings\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Disadvantaged young people reported greater levels of violence in\u000d\u000a        their relationships, in respect of both frequency and severity, compared\u000d\u000a        to young people in the general population.\u000d\u000a      Most participants felt that this was a normal aspect of teenage\u000d\u000a        relationships.\u000d\u000a      Disadvantaged girls reported greater levels of negative impact on\u000d\u000a        their welfare than boys.\u000d\u000a      Most young people interviewed had some form of professional support,\u000d\u000a        but only a minority had told an adult about the violence. Most felt\u000d\u000a        adults would not be interested or would not respond appropriately.\u000d\u000a      Two groups were particularly vulnerable: teenage mothers and young\u000d\u000a        people who had been in care.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The research has been widely disseminated &#8212; see references 2, 4 and 5 in\u000d\u000a      section 3.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40301","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Ministers expressed concern that about 5,000 children were waiting for\u000d\u000a      suitable adoptive parents when there was a lack of adoptive parents and\u000d\u000a      that the research clearly identified the fee as contributing to structural\u000d\u000a      problems in the system. Selwyn was invited to Downing Street to join a\u000d\u000a      `round table' on child welfare policy; she became one of the key advisors\u000d\u000a      to HM Treasury's review of adoption and was the only academic advisor on\u000d\u000a      the Government's Expert Working Group on Adoption [c]. The Parliamentary\u000d\u000a      Under Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families sent a\u000d\u000a      letter (2009) to all Directors of Children's Services stating:\u000d\u000a    \"I am writing to draw your attention to a report on adoption and the\u000d\u000a        inter-agency fee...The report raises some challenging but helpful\u000d\u000a        questions about the way some local authorities structure their budgets\u000d\u000a        for children in care and commission adoptive placements\" [d].\u000d\u000a    A year later (2010) The Minister quoted the findings in a letter sent to\u000d\u000a      Directors of Children's Services \"Despite all the evidence &#8212; most\u000d\u000a        notably in Dr Julie Selwyn's report last year on adoption and the\u000d\u000a        inter-agency fee &#8212; there still seems to be a widespread view that making\u000d\u000a        use of voluntary adoption agencies should be seen as a last resort...

Selwyn gave a\u000d\u000a      presentation to the House of Lords Select Committee on adoption\u000d\u000a      legislation and was recalled to give oral evidence\u000d\u000a      (20\/11\/2011;19\/06\/2012). She also appeared before the Children and\u000d\u000a      Families Bill Committee (legislative scrutiny) to give oral evidence in\u000d\u000a      the House of Commons. In 2013, the DfE published `Further Action on\u000d\u000a      Adoption' again quoting the study and stating:\u000d\u000a    \"The rapid growth in the numbers of children waiting on placement\u000d\u000a        orders in recent years suggests that the adoption system is not\u000d\u000a        effective in translating increases in the numbers going through the\u000d\u000a        system into increased incentives on agencies to recruit and assess. This\u000d\u000a        analysis of the structure of the system helps to explain why. It\u000d\u000a        demonstrates that the real improvement we need cannot happen while\u000d\u000a        provision is dominated by 152 local authorities trying to recruit and\u000d\u000a        approve only the adopters they immediately need and around 30 voluntary\u000d\u000a        agencies artificially limited by the reluctance of local authorities to\u000d\u000a        use their adopters.\" [i]\u000d\u000a    The Government called for rapid change in practice and stated that a new\u000d\u000a      statutory power would be acquired to remove adoption services from local\u000d\u000a      authorities if they did not remove systemic barriers constraining the\u000d\u000a      recruitment of adopters. In 2013, Government announced an additional &#163;16\u000d\u000a      million for the expansion of the VAA sector [j].\u000d\u000a    In response, the Association of Directors of Children's Services, the\u000d\u000a      Local Government Association and the Society of Local Authority Chief\u000d\u000a      Executives announced that one of the steps they intended to take was swift\u000a        progress on the levelling of the inter-agency fee, describing it as\u000d\u000a      a systematic disincentive to adopter recruitment. Their joint statement\u000d\u000a      stated that by September 2013, all LAs should have implemented a single\u000d\u000a      fee set at the higher VAA rate [k].\u000d\u000a    Media coverage\u000d\u000a    Extensive media coverage followed the study launch 2009-2010 (The\u000d\u000a      Guardian, The Times, The Telegraph, Local Government Chronicle, Children\u000d\u000a      and Young People Now, Communitycare.co.uk). Selwyn gave live interviews to\u000d\u000a      Radio 5 and Radio 4 Women's Hour. Findings were comprehensively cited in a\u000d\u000a      Policy Exchange report on adoption and in a key Demos report on the care\u000d\u000a      system [l].\u000d\u000a    Influenced an appeal to the Charity Commission\u000d\u000a    Selwyn provided evidence in 2011 in the case of the Charity Commission v\u000d\u000a      Catholic Care (VAA). The VAA argued that unless it were permitted to\u000d\u000a      discriminate against gay\/lesbian prospective adopters, it would no longer\u000d\u000a      be able to raise the voluntary income from its supporters on which it\u000d\u000a      relied to run the adoption service, and it would therefore have to close\u000d\u000a      its adoption service. The Charity advanced a case of proportionate\u000d\u000a      discrimination in order to achieve a legitimate aim and argued it should\u000d\u000a      be exempted from equality legislation. Selwyn was called as a witness and\u000d\u000a      evidence was used from the study to argue against Catholic Care's case.[m]\u000d\u000a    \"The Tribunal concluded that... the Charity's case was... contradicted\u000d\u000a        by evidence presented to the Tribunal of the dominant influence that\u000d\u000a        local authority funding arrangements have on the work of the voluntary\u000d\u000a        adoption agencies and the inability of the voluntary adoption agency\u000d\u000a        sector to overcome the problems created by that system through its own\u000d\u000a        practice...in all the circumstances and having considered the evidence\u000d\u000a        carefully, the Tribunal has unanimously decided to dismiss the Charity's\u000d\u000a        appeal.\" (para 61)\u000d\u000a    This forced all the 12 Catholic VAAs to change their literature and\u000d\u000a      practice and prevented further appeals to be exempt from equality\u000d\u000a      legislation. There has since been a growth in the number of gay\/lesbian\u000d\u000a      adopters [a].\u000d\u000a    Impact on social work practice\u000d\u000a    2012-2013 saw an increase in the number of children adopted and was the\u000d\u000a      highest figure since records of adoptions from care began in 1992. This\u000d\u000a      represented an increase of 20% on the previous year while the care\u000d\u000a      population as a whole grew only 2% over the same time period. There was\u000d\u000a      also greater use of VAAs who placed more children for adoption than in any\u000d\u000a      of the previous 10 years: exceeding the previous year by 20% [a]. The\u000d\u000a      research evidence had clearly shown that the inter-agency fee was a major\u000d\u000a      barrier to effective collaboration, that perceptions that VAAs were\u000d\u000a      expensive were false and that the fee acted as a deterrent for agencies to\u000d\u000a      recruit more adoptive parents. Government ministers accepted the findings\u000d\u000a      and strongly encouraged the sector to remove the disincentive and\u000d\u000a      supported VAAs to grow, investing &#163;16 million in the expansion. A strong\u000d\u000a      voluntary sector was seen as crucial to sustainable reform of the adoption\u000d\u000a      system. The intention being to ensure that enough adoptive parents were\u000d\u000a      recruited and that children were placed with adoptive parents who best met\u000d\u000a      their needs, not adoptive parents who appeared to cost the least.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on adoption and the inter-agency fee influenced a major\u000d\u000a      governmental review of adoption policy and practice.

Most of these children come from a background of\u000d\u000a      abuse\/neglect and whose parents misused drugs\/alcohol. Research has\u000d\u000a      consistently shown that most adopted children have more stable placements\u000d\u000a      and better outcomes than children in foster or residential care [1].\u000d\u000a      However, the number being adopted has fallen while there has been an\u000d\u000a      increase in the number of infants staying in the care system: about 25% of\u000d\u000a      children with a plan for adoption are never found a family [1]. Yet about\u000d\u000a      500 adoptive parents approved by voluntary adoption agencies (VAAs) are\u000d\u000a      waiting for a placement [a]. One of the reasons for this `mismatch' was\u000d\u000a      the financial arrangement that takes place between a Local Authority (LA)\u000d\u000a      and a VAA. If a LA wishes to place a child with an adopter approved by a\u000d\u000a      VAA, the LA must pay an inter-agency fee (&#163;23k). The fee is intended to\u000d\u000a      help the VAA recoup their costs of assessing and training the adoptive\u000d\u000a      parents.\u000d\u000a    The research aimed to understand how the inter-agency fee was affecting\u000d\u000a      the placement of children; estimate the costs of adoption; and to make\u000d\u000a      recommendations about future policy and practice.\u000d\u000a    It was found that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      LA managers did not understand, or have readily available data to\u000d\u000a        estimate, the costs of their services. They did not know what services\u000d\u000a        cost, overheads costs were usually omitted (these were perceived as\u000d\u000a        free) and decisions about commissioning and funding of services were\u000d\u000a        based on inaccurate financial data. This lack of understanding had\u000d\u000a        perverse consequences such as children being left in care (minimum cost\u000d\u000a        &#163;25k per year) rather than the one off inter-agency fee being paid.\u000d\u000a      Although the inter-agency fee (&#163;23K) was perceived by LA staff as\u000d\u000a        expensive it actually fell short of the actual cost (&#163;37K). In fact, LAs\u000d\u000a        and VAAs costs were very similar once overheads were included in the\u000d\u000a        comparison. But VAAs provided better value for money because they found\u000d\u000a        families for the more difficult to place children e. g. sibling groups,\u000d\u000a        minority ethnic children. The view that VAAs were expensive was\u000d\u000a        misguided and inaccurate.\u000d\u000a      It was estimated that the VAAs were contributing annually about &#163;4\u000d\u000a        million from their own resources (donations, legacies etc.) to adoption\u000d\u000a        services. It was therefore not surprising to find that many VAAs were in\u000d\u000a        financial difficulties, three agencies had closed and that the sector\u000d\u000a        was in crisis and there was a very real danger that the expertise of\u000d\u000a        more agencies would be lost.\u000d\u000a      Nationally there was a severe shortage of adoptive parents, resulting\u000d\u000a        in many children never finding an adoptive family. Yet the fee acted as\u000d\u000a        a disincentive for LAs to recruit more adopters than were needed in\u000d\u000a        their local area.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The study involved interlinked pieces of work. The research was led by Dr\u000d\u000a      Julie Selwyn (Senior Lecturer, 2003 to 2009; Reader 2009-2012 and\u000d\u000a      Professor of Child and Family and Social Work, August 2012 to present) at\u000d\u000a      the University of Bristol with Loughborough University having\u000d\u000a      responsibility for estimating LA adoption agency overheads. The study\u000d\u000a      utilised: i) financial accounts for 2007-2008 from adoption teams in 10\u000d\u000a      LAs and 17 VAAs; ii) activity data (outputs) from 8 LAs and 10 VAAs; iii)\u000d\u000a      telephone interviews with 61 adoptive parents; iv) other LA financial\u000d\u000a      data; and v) analysis of historical documents relating to the fee from the\u000d\u000a      1970s.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40302","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282028","Name":"Maldives"},{"GeoNamesId":"3489940","Name":"Jamaica"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"932692","Name":"Lesotho"},{"GeoNamesId":"2403846","Name":"Sierra Leone"},{"GeoNamesId":"2453866","Name":"Mali"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"223816","Name":"Djibouti"},{"GeoNamesId":"2103350","Name":"Solomon Islands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2233387","Name":"Cameroon"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"2245662","Name":"Senegal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2029969","Name":"Mongolia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3617476","Name":"Nicaragua"},{"GeoNamesId":"1512440","Name":"Uzbekistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3723988","Name":"Haiti"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2440476","Name":"Niger"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2363686","Name":"Togo"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"1252634","Name":"Bhutan"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"2134431","Name":"Vanuatu"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1327865","Name":"Myanmar"},{"GeoNamesId":"1062947","Name":"Madagascar"},{"GeoNamesId":"433561","Name":"Burundi"},{"GeoNamesId":"2434508","Name":"Chad"},{"GeoNamesId":"1655842","Name":"Laos"},{"GeoNamesId":"69543","Name":"Yemen"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The CSPSJ's work and research has had a major international impact. In\u000d\u000a      2006-07, UNICEF successfully used it to lobby the UN General Assembly to\u000d\u000a      adopt a new, international definition of child poverty which reflects the\u000d\u000a      needs and rights of children. It noted: \"According to this new\u000d\u000a        definition, measuring child poverty can no longer be lumped together\u000d\u000a        with general poverty assessments which often focus solely on income\u000d\u000a        levels, but must take into consideration access to basic social\u000d\u000a        services, especially nutrition, water, sanitation, shelter, education\u000d\u000a        and information\" [a]. UNICEF made the Bristol Approach a core part\u000d\u000a      of its Global Study on Child Poverty and Disparities, conducted in\u000d\u000a      54 countries [b] since 2008. Team members advised over 40 individual\u000d\u000a      UNICEF country and five regional offices, ran training workshops, and\u000d\u000a      guided NGOs and national governments (e.g., Mexico, South Africa)\u000d\u000a      interested in developing and applying the Bristol Approach. The Global\u000d\u000a        Study has improved national, regional and global awareness of how\u000d\u000a      appropriate social and economic policies can eradicate child poverty.\u000d\u000a      UNICEF stated in 2009 that \"...the research...transformed the way\u000d\u000a        UNICEF and many of its partners both understood and measured the poverty\u000d\u000a        suffered by children.... [it] has exposed policy-makers all over the\u000d\u000a        world to a new understanding of child poverty and inequalities. As a\u000d\u000a        consequence, children are more visible in poverty reduction policies and\u000d\u000a        debates\" [c].\u000d\u000a    The Global Study's 54 countries (listed at the end of this\u000d\u000a      section) represent over 1.5 billion children &#8212; approximately 60% of the\u000d\u000a      children in the developing world. Specific examples of the direct regional\u000d\u000a      and national impact include:\u000d\u000a    China: UNICEF and the Chinese Government's Leading Group Office of\u000d\u000a      Poverty Alleviation and Development agreed to consider child poverty as\u000d\u000a      distinct from adult poverty, conduct research to understand the child\u000d\u000a      poverty situation in China, and design and pilot schemes that identify the\u000d\u000a      dynamics of child-poverty alleviation at the local level. As a result,\u000d\u000a      child poverty is now incorporated in the ten-year National Rural Poverty\u000d\u000a      Reduction Strategy 2011-2020 [d], which will benefit China's 322,000,000\u000d\u000a      children;\u000d\u000a    Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Region: In 2010, the Economic\u000d\u000a      Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) applied the Bristol\u000d\u000a      Approach to produce the first-ever regional study of child poverty for the\u000d\u000a      Americas [e]. In 2012 UNICEF's Senior Regional Adviser on Social and\u000d\u000a      Economic Policy stated: \"...the study developed by the University of\u000d\u000a        Bristol is quoted in the region, when child poverty is discussed...it is\u000d\u000a        used to teach or improve interventions...it is in the core of policy\u000d\u000a        discussions in the region\" [i]. CSPSJ research has influenced the\u000d\u000a      design and content of a free, online, multilingual, multimedia training\u000d\u000a      guide for estimating child poverty in the LAC region, to protect and\u000d\u000a      promote child and adolescent rights [f]. This resource is available to the\u000d\u000a      general public, and has been used by advocates for children's rights,\u000d\u000a      journalists, NGOs and policy makers in the region;\u000d\u000a    East Asia and the Pacific Region: In 2011, the CSPSJ provided data\u000d\u000a      for the first ever UNICEF Regional Report on Child Poverty in East Asia\u000d\u000a      and the Pacific [g]. The report demonstrated high levels of deprivation of\u000d\u000a      basic needs among children and provided governments in the region with\u000d\u000a      policy-relevant data previously lacking;\u000d\u000a    South Asia Region: In November 2009 at a conference in Dhaka,\u000d\u000a      Bangladesh (Achieving Child Wellbeing and Equality: Towards a new\u000d\u000a        understanding of child poverty and deprivations) Prof. Gordon made\u000d\u000a      presentations to a ministerial-level audience of policymakers from India,\u000d\u000a      Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Bangladesh;\u000d\u000a    Mozambique: In 2008, the Government responded to Bristol\/UNICEF's\u000d\u000a      work on child poverty by approving the Children's Act, and translating the\u000d\u000a      UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into national child-rights\u000d\u000a      legislation. It has since invested strongly in education and health,\u000d\u000a      resulting in significant reductions in the proportion of children\u000d\u000a      experiencing deprivation, and in 2010 introduced the Basic Social\u000d\u000a      Protection Strategy, which includes child grants to alleviate child\u000d\u000a      poverty. In 2013 UNICEF's Senior Social Policy Specialist reported that\u000d\u000a      Bristol's research has helped the Government understand what exactly is\u000d\u000a      needed to address the problem of child poverty, for example increasing the\u000d\u000a      budget for programmes designed to deal with child poverty;\u000d\u000a    Ukraine: Advocacy around the Global Study resulted in the\u000d\u000a      inclusion in 2009 of the child poverty rate as a national Millennium\u000d\u000a      Development Goals (MDG) indicator and therefore part of the MDG\u000d\u000a      achievement agenda. It also resulted in the Annual State Report on\u000d\u000a      Children in 2009 focusing on child poverty;\u000d\u000a    Haiti: Research by CSPSJ provided the first ever estimates of\u000d\u000a      child poverty in Haiti. The data were reflected in the 2008 Haitian\u000d\u000a      National Poverty Reduction Strategy and UNICEF's 2009-2011 Country\u000d\u000a      Programme Documents. Following the devastating earthquake of January 2010,\u000d\u000a      our work was also used by UNICEF in its Humanitarian Action Report\u000d\u000a        2010 Partnering for Children in Emergencies.\u000d\u000a    In summary, these examples demonstrate the significant, international,\u000d\u000a      social and policy-related impact of the Bristol Approach. Governments, UN\u000d\u000a      organizations and NGOs around the world have adopted, adapted and applied\u000d\u000a      it to child and youth poverty measurement.\u000d\u000a    UNICEF has also used CSPSJ's work in its Socio-Economic Policies for\u000d\u000a        Child Rights with Equity training programme, which aims \"to\u000d\u000a        enhance the theoretical understanding of all professional level UNICEF\u000d\u000a        staff on public policy and development issues, strengthen their ability\u000d\u000a        to apply this knowledge in the design and implementation of policies and\u000d\u000a        programmes and help build effective partnerships to promote children's\u000d\u000a        rights and wellbeing\" [h]. In 2013, UNICEF's Innocenti Research\u000d\u000a      Centre developed an online tool for conducting Multiple Overlapping\u000d\u000a      Deprivation Analysis (MODA) in respect of children. This freely available,\u000d\u000a      interactive tool acknowledges and builds directly on the work of the\u000d\u000a      CSPSJ, and is used by researchers, students, NGOs and international\u000d\u000a      organisations.\u000d\u000a    Note: Participant countries in UNICEF's Global Study include\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Cambodia,\u000d\u000a      Cameroon, Chad, China, Congo, Congo DR, Djibouti, Egypt, Ghana, India,\u000d\u000a      Indian Ocean Islands, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan,\u000d\u000a      Lao PDR, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Mexico, Mongolia,\u000d\u000a      Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Occupied\u000d\u000a      Palestinian Territory, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone,\u000d\u000a      Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Ukraine,\u000d\u000a      Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vietnam, Yemen, Zimbabwe.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted by the Centre for the Study of Poverty and Social\u000d\u000a      Justice (CSPSJ) led to a new way of assessing child poverty in developing\u000d\u000a      countries. This novel method (termed the Bristol Approach) resulted in the\u000d\u000a      United Nations General Assembly's adoption, for the first time, of an\u000d\u000a      international definition of child poverty (2006). It also underpinned\u000d\u000a      UNICEFs Global Study on Child Poverty and Disparities (2008-10),\u000d\u000a      which was run in over 50 countries. In the last ten years, the CSPSJ's\u000d\u000a      work has put child poverty at the centre of international social and\u000d\u000a      public policy debates. Its researchers have advised governments and\u000d\u000a      international agencies on devising anti-poverty strategies and programmes\u000d\u000a      that specifically meet the needs of children, and have significantly\u000d\u000a      influenced the way child poverty is studied around the world. The Centre\u000d\u000a      has developed academic and professional training courses for organisations\u000d\u000a      like UNICEF on the issues of children's rights and child-poverty. Our work\u000d\u000a      has also spurred NGOs such as Save the Children to develop their own\u000d\u000a      child-development indices, and so has had a direct and profound impact on\u000d\u000a      the lives of poor children around the planet.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2429323","Name":"Lac Region"},{"GeoNamesId":"1185241","Name":"Dhaka"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Outputs\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Townsend P. &amp; Gordon, D.

This project builds on the CSPSJ's work on child\u000d\u000a      poverty, bringing the Bristol Approach to a much wider audience of\u000d\u000a      academics, policymakers, anti-poverty advocates and campaigners.\u000d\u000a    [7] In 2011, Gordon and Nandy secured Canadian $125,000 (~&#163;80,000) from\u000d\u000a      the Canadian Institute for Health Research as part of a research\u000d\u000a      consortium including colleagues from Canada, Peru, India, South Africa and\u000d\u000a      the USA. The three-year project (Examining the Impact of Social\u000d\u000a        Policies on Health Equity) examines the impact of social and\u000d\u000a      economic policies on child and maternal morbidity and mortality.\u000d\u000a    [8] In 2012, Nandy was awarded a &#163;209,000 ESRC Future Research Leader\u000d\u000a      grant to extend the Bristol Approach to adults, with a particular focus on\u000d\u000a      countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

No reliable estimates\u000d\u000a      had previously existed for the number of poor children in such countries,\u000d\u000a      which limited the impact of international organisations like UNICEF. This\u000d\u000a      lack of data on children's living conditions was both problematic and\u000d\u000a      unnecessary, and something the Bristol Approach was designed to address.\u000d\u000a      The Bristol Approach entailed the development of policy-relevant,\u000d\u000a      non-monetary indicators of child deprivation of basic needs (e.g. shelter,\u000d\u000a      education, health care and nutrition), which are now used around the world\u000d\u000a      to assess child and youth poverty. Funding was provided by UNICEF\u000d\u000a      (~&#163;150,000) and the UK Department for International Development\u000d\u000a      (~&#163;212,000), and the work was conducted between 2001 and 2009. It involved\u000d\u000a      the development of a conceptual framework [1, 5], extensive reviews of the\u000d\u000a      international literature on child poverty and child rights [4], and\u000d\u000a      secondary data analysis of household-survey micro data from over 75\u000d\u000a      countries.\u000d\u000a    The Bristol Approach produced the first scientific global estimates of\u000d\u000a      child poverty in 2003 [2]. It revealed that over one billion children were\u000d\u000a      severely deprived of at least one basic human need, and identified where\u000d\u000a      these children lived and the pattern of deprivations they experienced. The\u000d\u000a      research, which has received over 300 academic citations, has allowed\u000d\u000a      organisations like UNICEF and Save the Children to advocate more\u000d\u000a      forcefully for the rights of children around the world. The work was\u000d\u000a      identified as an example of best practice by the international Rio Expert\u000d\u000a      Group on Poverty Statistics and included in its Compendium of Best\u000d\u000a        Practices.\u000d\u000a    The outputs of the work included a better conceptual understanding of\u000d\u000a      child poverty as a distinct issue, the development of child-relevant\u000d\u000a      indicators of deprivation and valuable, policy-relevant, actionable data\u000d\u000a      on the patterning of child poverty in countries which hitherto lacked\u000d\u000a      reliable information on children. It detailed the extent and persistence\u000d\u000a      of gender, social and spatial disparities, enabling campaigning\u000d\u000a      organisations such as Plan International and UNICEF to advocate for\u000d\u000a      resources and services for children.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, in the face of the international economic crisis, UNICEF\u000d\u000a      launched its Global Study on Child Poverty and Disparities in over\u000d\u000a      50 countries, including China, India, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh,\u000d\u000a      Nigeria and Mexico, which contain most of the world's one billion-plus\u000d\u000a      poor children. The Bristol Approach is a core part of the Global Study,\u000d\u000a      underpinning each of the country studies conducted. Selected outputs of\u000d\u000a      the CSPSJ's work and the Bristol Approach include:\u000d\u000a    (i) The development of a new measure for assessing aggregate child\u000d\u000a      undernutrition, the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) [3],\u000d\u000a      which researchers have used in over a dozen countries, and most recently\u000d\u000a      in a major Gates Foundation-funded, multi-country research project on the\u000d\u000a      links between anthropometric failure and child mortality (McDonald et al,\u000d\u000a      2013, Am J Clin Nutr. 97(4):896-901);\u000d\u000a    (ii) The running of national, regional and international training\u000d\u000a      workshops\/conferences for UN, NGO and government staff on conceptualising\u000d\u000a      and measuring child poverty, statistical data analysis and the use of data\u000d\u000a      for public-policy development. Since 2008, the research team has\u000d\u000a      contributed to workshops\/conferences in Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Amman,\u000d\u000a      Bishkek, Brasilia, Dhaka, Kathmandu, London, Mexico City, New York,\u000d\u000a      Odessa, Southampton and Tashkent;\u000d\u000a    (iii) The importance of the round-trip time taken to collect water has\u000d\u000a      been proposed by WHO\/UNICEF as one of the new, post-2015 Millennium\u000d\u000a      Development Goal indicators (Target indicator 2.2a). This was a direct\u000d\u000a      result of the assistance provided to the WHO Joint Monitoring Project by\u000d\u000a      Professor Gordon and Dr Nandy as part of their work for UNICEF;\u000d\u000a    (iv) The establishment of an international, one-year postgraduate Diploma\u000d\u000a      in Public Policy and Child Rights, run for education, social work and\u000d\u000a      other professionals across the Arab world in conjunction with the\u000d\u000a      Universities of Cairo and Assuit (Egypt), the Hashemite University\u000d\u000a      (Jordan) and the University of Jordan, and with UNICEF's Middle East and\u000d\u000a      North Africa regional office, funded by the EU's TEMPUS Programme. To\u000d\u000a      date, about 30 students have completed the course, with similar numbers\u000d\u000a      enrolled for next year. The Egyptian and Jordanian governments funded 15\u000d\u000a      scholarships for students doing the Diploma.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40303","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Following the high profile murder of Victoria Climbi&#233; by her carers in\u000d      Haringey, London, the Government commissioned the Laming Report. Laming\u000d      concluded that \"The suffering and death of Victoria was a gross failure of\u000d      the system and was inexcusable\". As part of the solution, he asserted\u000d      that:\u000d    \"Multi-agency training is important in helping professionals understand\u000d      the respective roles and responsibilities and the procedures of each\u000d      agency involved in child protection, in developing a joint understanding\u000d      of assessment and decision making practices...However, the scale and\u000d      quality of multi-agency training needs to be substantially improved...\"\u000d      (5.18).\u000d    As part of the Government's response to Laming, the departments\u000d      responsible for health and education jointly commissioned the Safeguarding\u000d      Children Research Initiative. This programme of research studies was\u000d      intended to provide a stronger evidence base for the development of policy\u000d      and practice aimed at improving the protection of children in England.\u000d      John Carpenter in Bristol's School for Policy Studies proposed an\u000d      evaluation of the organisation, outcomes and costs of existing\u000d      safeguarding training. He pointed out that the evidence to support\u000d      Laming's assertions about the value of inter-agency training, its scale\u000d      and quality was entirely lacking.\u000d    The proposal was successful and from the beginning generated significant\u000d      interest from policymakers in both departments. This was reinforced by\u000d      presentations at a series of seminars for policymakers held as part of the\u000d      research initiative. There was praise from policy makers for the extent\u000d      and quality of the study and the encouraging nature of the findings.\u000d      Within weeks of the report [1] being submitted, presentations of the\u000d      findings were requested at the annual conference of the Association for\u000d      Directors of Children's Services, the Children's Workforce Development\u000d      Council and a major conference in Westminster on the Government's response\u000d      to Laming's One Year On report [a].\u000d    The Government's (2010) revision of Working Together [b] made\u000d      explicit reference to the research in chapter 4 on training, which has the\u000d      status of statutory guidance. As quoted above in Sec. 3, the Government\u000d      was able, for the first time, to cite research about the outcomes of\u000d      inter-agency training and emphasise its importance. This section of the\u000d      guidance draws very heavily on the research. Other key findings which are\u000d      referenced include the effectiveness of LSCB-managed training and the\u000d      strengths and vulnerabilities in the system. The findings on the\u000d      effectiveness on inter-agency training have been taken up by LSCBs and\u000d      have been used in the revision of LSCB's annual plans and promotion of\u000d      inter-agency training locally, for example by London LSCB [c]. A survey of\u000d      training coordinators (n = 42) in the North and Midlands (August 2013)\u000d      showed that all were aware of the research and 98% had cited it in their\u000d      training strategies and funding plans (report available).\u000d    The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health on behalf of the other\u000d      Royal Colleges of Medicine and Nursing (2010) reviewed the roles and\u000d      competences of health care staff, citing the research report as a primary\u000d      source for England [d]. Among the findings of the research was the fact\u000d      that GPs were under-represented in inter-agency training; this is a matter\u000d      of great concern given their key role in the child protection system. This\u000d      message was emphasised by the Department for Education (2011) in a\u000d      research briefing [e]:\u000d    \"Attendance at LSCB inter-agency training events is effective in making\u000d      links and encouraging a better understanding of shared roles and\u000d      responsibilities between professionals. GPs, in particular, need to\u000d      prioritise attendance at these events and collectively shape and\u000d      contribute to an effective and efficient local training programme.\"\u000d    In the survey of training coordinators, 80% were aware of this finding\u000d      and, of these, 96% had made efforts to increase participation, with\u000d      notable success. For example, a review of Northumberland LSCB's training\u000d      strategy, which refers to the research, reported that their efforts had\u000d      resulted in a 30% increase in GPs participating in inter-agency training\u000d      (Recommendation 6) [f].\u000d    The Munro Review of Child Protection commissioned by the coalition\u000d      Government (2011) reiterated the findings of the research on effectiveness\u000d      (Sec. 4.15) and went further to warn &#8212; as the research had &#8212; about the\u000d      threat to inter-agency training posed by cuts to LSCB budgets [g]. The\u000d      survey found that 79% of training budget levels had been maintained in\u000d      spite of cuts to partner agency budgets and that extensive programmes were\u000d      being provided: 62% of LSCBs had actually increased their provision and\u000d      only two had reduced it.\u000d    Picking up another recommendation from the findings, Munro also stressed\u000d      that training should be evaluated (Sec. 4.16). With the encouragement of\u000d      Piat (the organisation of inter-agency trainers in child protection) and\u000d      the technical support of the NSPCC, the research team developed an\u000d      interactive evaluation toolkit [h]. This contains everything necessary for\u000d      conducting a rigorous evaluation, including letters to participants, a set\u000d      of scales which were designed and validated for the research and\u000d      downloadable Excel spread-sheets for data entry which automatically\u000d      generate charts showing the results and enable comparison with the\u000d      findings from the research. Fifteen LSCBs in the survey had used this\u000d      resource as part of their training strategy &#8212; for example, in North\u000d      Yorkshire and Coventry [i].\u000d    In addition to the Department for Education's promotion of the findings\u000d      [a], the research was one of four studies chosen to feature in a seminar\u000d      for policymakers, researchers and representatives of professional bodies\u000d      in 2011. This seminar launched the overview of the outcomes of the whole\u000d      Safeguarding Children research initiative in the Department's highly\u000d      influential Messages from Research series [j] in which the\u000d      findings of this \"high quality\" study are summarised and discussed.\u000d    Summary\u000d      The beneficiaries from this research are policymakers in government\u000d      departments and across England in the LSCBs which are providing and\u000d      promoting inter-agency training. The research has provided the missing\u000d      evidence for its effectiveness and of the necessary organisational\u000d      arrangements. Through this training, which is currently being delivered to\u000d      an estimated 100,000 participants annually, professionals from health,\u000d      social services and education are learning how to work together more\u000d      effectively. The researchers would not claim that training alone is\u000d      sufficient to prevent child deaths, but this initiative can hope to reduce\u000d      the number of gross system failures identified by Lord Laming as\u000d      contributing to the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Policymakers in the government departments responsible for health and\u000d      education, Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) and many thousands\u000d      of professionals with child-protection roles have benefited from Bristol's\u000d      research into inter-agency training. The research provided crucial\u000d      information on efficient organisational partnerships for training and\u000d      strong evidence of the effectiveness of inter-agency training in promoting\u000d      mutual understanding, changing attitudes and developing confidence.\u000d      Bristol's findings underpinned statutory guidance in the Government's Working\u000d        Together to Safeguard Children (2010) [b], which required LSCBs to\u000d      provide such training. The research ended a 30-year period during which\u000d      inquiries into the deaths of children at the hands of their parents\u000d      consistently criticised the failure of professionals to communicate and\u000d      work together effectively and advocated inter-agency training as a\u000d      solution, but had little or no supporting evidence.\u000d    Specific impacts are evidenced in: the citation of the research findings\u000d      in support of LSCBs' training strategies; the increased provision of\u000d      training programmes in the three years since publication, in spite of\u000d      budget restrictions; the successful targeting of previously disengaged\u000d      groups, particularly GPs; and the use of an NSPCC-sponsored bespoke\u000d      evaluation toolkit developed by the research team.\u000d    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d    University of Bristol\u000d    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d    \u000a[1] Carpenter, J., Patsios, D., Szilassy, E. and Hackett, S.

Within the UK, government\u000d      departments knew little about the organisation, effectiveness or value for\u000d      money of inter-agency training programmes provided under the auspices of\u000d      LSCBs.\u000d    Funder, researchers and dates\u000d      The research was commissioned by the Department of Health and the\u000d      Department for Children, Schools and Families as part of a national\u000d      safeguarding research initiative and was undertaken in 2007-10. It was led\u000d      by John Carpenter (Professor of Social Work, Bristol, since 2005) with\u000d      Research Associates Drs Demi Patsios (1998-) and Eszter Szilassy (2006-8).\u000d      Professor Simon Hackett (Durham) was a consultant advising specifically on\u000d      child abuse research evidence.\u000d    Key findings\u000d      The research studied the organisation, outcomes and costs of inter-agency\u000d      training in eight LSCB areas in England [1]. It involved over 60\u000d      interviews and case studies, together with the development and use of\u000d      measures to assess training outcomes for over 2,000 professionals who\u000d      participated in 129 courses. The main study finding was summarised in Working\u000a        Together (2010):\u000d    \"Research for the Department of Children, Schools and Families and the\u000d      Department of Health (2009) has shown that inter-agency training is highly\u000d      effective in helping professionals understand their respective roles and\u000d      responsibilities, the procedures of each agency involved in safeguarding\u000d      children and in developing a shared understanding of assessment and\u000d      decision-making practices. Further, the opportunity to learn together is\u000d      greatly valued; participants report increased confidence in working with\u000d      colleagues from other agencies and greater mutual respect.\" (HM Government\u000d      2010 para. 4.3)\u000d    The research provided evidence, for the first time, of the effectiveness\u000d      of inter-agency training focused on collaboration between services for\u000d      children and adults where children are at heightened risk of harm, e.g.,\u000d      in the context of domestic violence [2], where a parent is experiencing\u000d      mental illness [3] or where the household includes a young person who has\u000d      sexually abused others [4]. The research identified the conditions under\u000d      which social services, education, health and criminal justice agencies\u000d      could collaborate effectively to provide and resource training programmes\u000d      [5]. It also pointed to the vulnerability of a system in which\u000d      safeguarding training is a statutory requirement and yet there is no\u000d      government funding to support it. Finally, the research provided, again\u000d      for the first time, an analysis of the costs of training and demonstrated\u000d      its value for money.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40304","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact on policing\u000a      In evidence collected during a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP)\u000a      project [see source [a], section 5], interviews with stakeholders and\u000a      criminal justice staff in the North East indicated that while the\u000a      Northumbria police were initially concerned that the attrition study\u000a      findings were critical of their response to domestic abuse incidents, they\u000a      were in fact receptive to those findings. The findings were said to\u000a      contribute to a raised awareness within Northumbria of inconsistency in\u000a      the charges made against alleged perpetrators of domestic violence\u000a      incidents and contributed to the re-examination of the police response to\u000a      such incidents.\u000a    The attrition study has subsequently influenced policing and police\u000a      responses to domestic violence across Europe, since it was used\u000a      extensively as a source of evidence in a report in 2012 entitled Overcoming\u000a        attrition in domestic violence cases [b]. This report was\u000a      commissioned by the Cyprus Police as the background and guiding paper to a\u000a      wider project on domestic violence which has subsequently resulted in a\u000a      European Police Handbook on Good Practice on Overcoming Attrition in\u000a      Domestic Violence within the framework of the Cyprus Presidency of the\u000a      Council of the European Union. The editor of the report has described\u000a      Hester's research as \"influential and guiding ... [as] is evident in the\u000a      report\" [c]. Hester's research provides much of the evidence base for the\u000a      report and specifically informs the report's recommendations that domestic\u000a      violence interventions should have a multi-agency approach at their\u000a      foundation, that interventions should be conducted according to a victim\u000a      safety-centred approach, and that where victims have dropped out of legal\u000a      proceedings \"Victimless\" investigations should be pursued where possible.\u000a      Hester contributed to the drafting of the European Police Handbook, when\u000a      it was presented at a workshop drawing the CEPOL Presidency Conference in\u000a      July 2012. The handbook received final approval by the European Commission\u000a      in November 2012. [c]\u000a    Impact on policy\u000a      There are many examples of how the studies have been used to inform UK\u000a      criminal justice policy and guidance since 2008. The attrition study was\u000a      referenced numerous times in the Home Affairs Select Committee Report on\u000a      domestic violence in 2008 [d]. For example, Hester's work was cited as\u000a      evidence that only a quarter of domestic violence cases which are reported\u000a      result in arrest. As a result of this report, the Home Office commissioned\u000a      a review from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in 2008\u000a      entitled \"Tackling perpetrators of violence against women and girls\" [e],\u000a      which specifically cites the Select Committee Report. The review attests,\u000a      \"Professor Marianne Hester and her team at the University of Bristol were\u000a      commissioned to compile the research and related evidence for the Review.\"\u000a      All three of the research studies described above were used as evidence\u000a      for the review, but the perpetrator study [2] was particularly influential\u000a      in informing the following recommendation, \"This Review recommends that\u000a      the law be changed to permit the registration and `tracking' of serial\u000a      perpetrators of violence against women and girls\". [e, p11 and 34]\u000a    The ACPO review then formed the basis of the Domestic Violence Disclosure\u000a      Scheme Consultation and Pilot Scheme, popularly known as \"Clare's Law\".\u000a      [f] The consultation exercise asked for views on three options:\u000a    \u000a      continue current arrangements under existing law\u000a      a \"right to ask\" national disclosure scheme\u000a      a \"right to know\" national disclosure scheme\u000a    \u000a    On the basis of the results of the consultation exercise a one-year pilot\u000a      commenced in the summer of 2012 to test out a domestic violence disclosure\u000a      scheme in the police force areas of Greater Manchester, Gwent,\u000a      Nottinghamshire and Wiltshire. The pilot is testing a process for enabling\u000a      the police to disclose to the public information about previous violent\u000a      offending by a new or existing partner where this may help protect them\u000a      from further violent offending. The pilot is testing two types of process\u000a      for disclosing this information. The first would be triggered by a request\u000a      by a member of the public (\"right to ask\"). The second would be triggered\u000a      by the police where they make a proactive decision to disclose the\u000a      information in order to protect a potential victim (\"right to know\"). Both\u000a      processes can be implemented within existing legal powers.\u000a    The impact of this research into domestic violence has also extended\u000a      beyond the UK. Interview data collected during the KTP reveals that the\u000a      attrition study findings were used as evidence in the passage of the\u000a      aggravated domestic violence bill by the New York State Assembly (June\u000a      2011). This legislation establishes the felony crime of aggravated family\u000a      offence for cases in which an offender is repeatedly convicted of abuse\u000a      against a family member. The interviewee, explained, \"a lot of the\u000a      argument was drawn from the attrition study that showed that multiple\u000a      offences were treated no differently than the initial offences.\"\u000a      [a]\u000a    The attrition study was cited in a report commissioned by Her Majesty's\u000a      Prison Cardiff on restorative justice and domestic violence with the aim\u000a      of increasing the effectiveness of their programmes with domestic violence\u000a      perpetrators [g]. Interview data from the attrition study was used as part\u000a      of a review commissioned by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and\u000a      Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Inspectorate to inform their joint\u000a      thematic inspection of the investigation and prosecution of domestic\u000a      violence cases [h]. In addition, the studies were included in a literature\u000a      review commissioned by the Crown Prosecution Service and the Department of\u000a      Constitutional Affairs to help the criminal and civil justice government\u000a      agencies judge the effectiveness of specialist courts and to inform the\u000a      government policy debate on specialist courts [i].\u000a    Impact on professionals and practitioners\u000a      The perpetrator study [2] has been used widely within the national\u000a      organisation RESPECT (the UK membership association for domestic violence\u000a      perpetrator programmes and associated support services) to inform their\u000a      work with professionals and practitioners, for example in training\u000a      materials and presentations delivered to a wide range of professionals and\u000a      practitioners [j]. The findings on men seeking help and approaching their\u000a      GPs was included in ten training events about perpetrators delivered\u000a      during 2011 to NHS staff, social workers, drug and alcohol workers, mental\u000a      health teams and council staff across London and East Sussex. The gender\u000a      of perpetrator study [3 &amp; 4] has been placed on the list of required\u000a      reading for Domestic Homicide Review panels by the Home Office Reader as\u000a      part of the quality assurance process.\u000a    In September 2012 Marianne Hester was awarded an OBE for her contribution\u000a      to the prevention of domestic violence.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    National and international policy on domestic violence has been strongly\u000a      influenced since 2008 by a series of studies on domestic violence\u000a      conducted at the University of Bristol, resulting for example in the\u000a      piloting of a national disclosure scheme. The studies have also had a\u000a      positive impact on the practical ways in which agencies such as the police\u000a      respond to domestic violence as well as influencing the development of a\u000a      European Police handbook on domestic violence.

The attrition study (2001 to 2003)\u000a      This research [see ref 1] was commissioned by the Northern Rock Foundation\u000a      following competitive tender and was carried out across the Northumbria\u000a      Police Force area. The key research question was related to \"attrition\" or\u000a      why cases of domestic violence fail to progress to prosecution or\u000a      conviction and reasons for such `drop out' between the time they are\u000a      reported to the police and the time court proceedings end. The study\u000a      contextualised this through the experiences of individuals (mainly women)\u000a      who had been victimised by domestic violence, as well as through the\u000a      perspectives and practices of the police, prosecutors, the courts and\u000a      non-criminal justice agencies.

The research found a complex relationship between victim safety,\u000a      policing, prosecution and court outcomes, and highlighted the importance\u000a      of consistency across the criminal justice system and other agencies. For\u000a      victimised women, attrition might be either positive or negative depending\u000a      on the extent to which the criminal justice enabled positive management of\u000a      their safety. [1]\u000a    2. Identifying and assessing the practical needs of domestic violence\u000a        offenders to inform early intervention (2004 to 2005)\u000a      Hester was commissioned by the Northern Rock Foundation and the Home\u000a      Office to undertake further work on domestic violence and the criminal\u000a      justice system [see ref 2]. Hester led a collaboration involving a team of\u000a      Home Office researchers, unique in having a university based academic\u000a      lead. The research had three strands:\u000a    \u000a      developing a detailed picture of domestic violence perpetrators\u000a        entering the criminal justice system;\u000a      identifying agencies and services involved in interventions with such\u000a        perpetrators;\u000a      highlighting perpetrators' help-seeking pathways and potential\u000a        opportunities for early intervention and prevention regarding\u000a        perpetration.\u000a    \u000a    Six hundred and ninety-two perpetrator profiles were compiled using\u000a      anonymised data from the Northumbria police tracked over three years, as\u000a      well as material from interviews with 62 domestic violence perpetrators\u000a      and a wide range of agencies and organisations. There was evidence of\u000a      repeat perpetration by half of perpetrators within three years, and that\u000a      nearly one in five reoffended against a different partner. New evidence\u000a      was found of `help-seeking' by perpetrators, who would most frequently\u000a      access GPs to elicit help.[2]\u000a    3. Gender of perpetrators (2007 to 2009)\u000a    Hester was commissioned by the Northern Rock Foundation specifically to\u000a    explore the issue of gender and perpetration [see refs 3 &amp; 4]. The study\u000a    explored how male victims and perpetrators of domestic violence may differ\u000a    from female victims and perpetrators in respect of the nature and number of\u000a    domestic violence incidents recorded by the police, and looked at the police\u000a    response. Building on the data from the two earlier studies, a sample of 96\u000a    cases was compiled using randomisation and saturation, which included male,\u000a    female and dual perpetrator cases. To explore in depth the nature of\u000a    domestic violence, which is a pattern of behaviour over time, the 96 cases\u000a    were tracked over six years, providing a detailed longitudinal picture of\u000a    domestic violence perpetration by men and women recorded by the police. It\u000a    is the only such detailed research in the UK, and is also unique\u000a    internationally. The research found that cases were very varied, but that\u000a    there were distinct patterns by gender. There were significant differences\u000a    between male and female perpetrators of domestic violence in many respects,\u000a    including the forms of violence, extent of abuse and impacts. Domestic\u000a    violence by male perpetrators was more severe and involved a greater number\u000a    of incidents while women were more likely to use weapons, often for\u000a    self-protection. Female perpetrators were disproportionately more likely to\u000a    be arrested.

Reading the Riots deliberately sought to maximise\u000a      public engagement. This aim was reflected in the research design and this\u000a      in turn led to further public engagement. Being run jointly with a news\u000a      organisation meant that the study moved particularly quickly and was\u000a      unusually extensive in its reach, utilising both the conventional print\u000a      edition of the newspaper, and other media, to reach as broad an audience\u000a      as possible in order to improve public understanding of the events. Speed\u000a      was vital to its success. The study was launched and, most unusually,\u000a      funding secured within weeks of the riots. The ESRC's announcement of its\u000a      Pilot Urgency Grants Programme recognised that RCUK need to be able \"to\u000a      respond to urgent or unforeseen events (for example the August 2011 UK\u000a      riots), where there is a strong case for immediate research\" [A]. The\u000a      research was commended by the Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee\u000a      as being both important and complementary to the work of the Committee\u000a      [B].\u000a    From 5th to 10th December 2011 The Guardian\u000a      ran approximately 34 stories over 23 pages of the newspaper reporting the\u000a      results of the first phase, and in July 2012 ran a further 18 stories over\u000a      11 pages of the paper, covering the results of phase two. The study\u000a      commanded six front page stories. The study was also reported extensively\u000a      in other UK media. On the first phase launch day, Paul Lewis and Tim\u000a      Newburn appeared on radio and television programmes with a combined\u000a      audience of over 30 million. Altogether during 2011 and 2012, 200\u000a      references were made to the research in the UK and international media.\u000a      The dedicated website for Reading the Riots has received 2.8\u000a      million hits.\u000a    Reading the Riots informed public understanding and challenged\u000a      current wisdom in a number of important ways. First, against a background\u000a      of official denial, the study clearly showed that anger against the police\u000a      was a specific motivation, particularly in the early days of rioting. This\u000a      element of the study was the subject of a special edition of BBC2's\u000a      Newsnight (5th December 2011), in which a film made by the Reading\u000a        the Riots team illustrating some of the key research findings [C]\u000a      was followed by a studio discussion (involving the then Police Minister,\u000a      the former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Lord Ian Blair, David\u000a      Lammy MP for Tottenham, and Tim Newburn). This argument was widely\u000a      reported across the media [D] and formed the basis of a specially\u000a      commissioned verbatim drama, also broadcast on the BBC [E].\u000a    Second, and contrary to initial claims made by the Home Secretary, the\u000a      research helped establish not only that the role played by gangs in the\u000a      riots was minimal, but also that a `truce' existed between gangs during\u000a      the disturbances [F]. Third, phase two of Reading the Riots, which built\u000a      on previous research on policing, minority communities and disaffected\u000a      youth (1-5), turned its attention to the response of the criminal justice\u000a      system to the riots, further informing public understanding. In\u000a      particular, it identified a series of problems besetting the policing of\u000a      the riots, highlighting the shortcomings in police radio technology, and\u000a      in the Metropolitan Police's use of mutual aid support from other forces.\u000a      The problems with the police tactics in the riots [G], the subject of a\u000a      second film made by the research team for a BBC2 Newsnight special in July\u000a      2012, were commented upon by the Police Minister, Nick Herbert, by David\u000a      Lammy MP and Mark Rowley, an Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan\u000a      Police in the studio [H], and subsequently also by the outgoing HM Chief\u000a      Inspector of Constabulary and by the Metropolitan Police's second in\u000a      command during the rioting [I].\u000a    An indicator of the public debate provoked by Reading the Riots\u000a      is the broad range of policy makers and others who reacted to its findings\u000a      in a variety of forums including LSE's conference in December 2011, and in\u000a      articles published in The Guardian and other media. They included:\u000a      the Home Secretary [J]; the Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Home\u000a      Secretary [K]; the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan\u000a      Police Service [L]; the Archbishop of Canterbury [M]; the Mayor of London\u000a      [N]; the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers, and the\u000a      Chairman of the Police Federation [J]; the Director of Public Prosecutions\u000a      [O]; the Chairman of the Government's post-riots Victims and Communities\u000a      Panel [P]; and Louise Casey, the Government's then lead on the response to\u000a      the riots [Q].\u000a    The most significant direct policy response to Reading the Riots\u000a      came at the LSE's conference on 14th December 2011. In her\u000a      speech, the Home Secretary announced a formal review [R] of best practice\u000a      in relation to police stop and search powers. A major element of this was\u000a      a review undertaken by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, a\u000a      primary prompt for which was the LSE and Guardian report [S]. HMIC\u000a      published their review in July 2013 [T], and in a statement in the House\u000a      of Commons on 2nd July 2013 the Home Secretary said she\u000a      anticipated significant reform of the use of these powers [U].\u000a    Recognition of the innovative partnership with The Guardian,\u000a      designed to increase public understanding of the 2011 riots, was\u000a      demonstrated by the award of `Innovation of the Year' at the British\u000a      Journalism Awards, the `Innovation Award' at the European Press awards,\u000a      and shortlisting for the THES `research project of the year, all in 2012.\u000a      The research has had substantial reach with media coverage and engagement\u000a      in France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Australia, India, New Zealand,\u000a      Singapore, the US, Canada, Russia, Zimbabwe.\u000a    Wider Implications: The Unit's work on understanding the riots is\u000a      important to the communities affected by the violence and destruction; to\u000a      the policy-makers with responsibility for responding to the issues raised\u000a      by the disorder, and to the police and other members of the criminal\u000a      justice system tasked with dealing with such an emergency. By helping\u000a      provide a more effective understanding of these major events, the Unit's\u000a      research is helping address the policy and practice issues raised by the\u000a      riots.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Unit's Criminal Justice group has carried out a significant body of\u000a      research relating to youth disaffection, anti-social behaviour and\u000a      policing.

The ensuing research achieved very wide reach via\u000a      conventional print and other media, informing public understanding of the\u000a      riots and challenging conventional wisdom about their causes. A wide range\u000a      of public figures reacted to the research and the Home Secretary's\u000a      response included the announcement of a formal review of police `stop and\u000a      search' practice.

Early work highlighted the clear social patterning of youthful\u000a      disaffection, examined the complex character of the nature of\u000a      `disaffection' - including factors such as gang membership, and\u000a      involvement in group disorder - and identified a heightened likelihood of\u000a      problematic relationships with adults in authority, especially the police\u000a      [1]. This and subsequent research illustrated the problems of\u000a      intervention, particularly when the police were involved, where high\u000a      levels of discretion combined with a managerialist target culture led to\u000a      disproportionate criminalisation of certain categories of young people\u000a      [2]. Other work examined the growing problem of police legitimacy,\u000a      especially where minority ethnic communities were concerned [3]. Finally,\u000a      a significant body of work examined the discriminatory use of police\u000a      powers and how effectively the police service had responded to calls for\u000a      radical reform in this area, concluding that despite indications of\u000a      progress there remained significant problems, not least in relation to the\u000a      use of `stop and search' and related powers [4,5].\u000a    As a result of this research, Tim Newburn was approached by The\u000a        Guardian when riots took place in London, Manchester, Birmingham,\u000a      Liverpool and elsewhere in August 2011. Influenced by a study of the\u000a      Detroit riot in 1967, by the University of Michigan and the Detroit Free\u000a      Press, The Guardian was keen on the idea of a larger-scale study\u000a      of the disturbances. Negotiations between Paul Lewis (of The Guardian),\u000a      who was at the forefront of the reporting of the riots, and Tim Newburn\u000a      led to the establishment of a joint research project. The highly unusual,\u000a      innovative study, Reading the Riots was announced in The\u000a        Guardian on 7th September 2011. Critically, financial\u000a      support from the Joseph Rowntree and Open Society Foundations was\u000a      negotiated within approximately two weeks, enabling staff to be recruited\u000a      and trained, and fieldwork to start on 5th October 2011.\u000a    The two primary objectives of Reading the Riots were (i) to use\u000a      social science to engage with public and political debates around the\u000a      disturbances and inform public understanding of the riots; and (ii) to\u000a      investigate the validity of some of the assumptions being made about the\u000a      riots, notably that they were organised by `gangs', and that social media\u000a      such as Twitter and Facebook had played a significant role in the\u000a      organisation of the disturbances. (Analysis of social media was carried\u000a      out by a team led by Professor Rob Procter, Manchester University.)\u000a    The research study, which adopted standard social science research\u000a      methods, involved almost 600 interviews with people caught up in the\u000a      disturbances. In phase one 270 rioters were interviewed across the five\u000a      main cities in which disorder occurred. This was completed and published\u000a      by early December 2011. Key findings included concerns about aggressive\u000a      and disrespectful policing, particularly focusing on the use of `stop and\u000a      search', and no evidence of a central role for gangs in the disorder [6].\u000a    The second phase of the study commenced in 2012 and involved almost 300\u000a      interviews being conducted with police officers across all the major\u000a      cities affected, with the prosecution and defence lawyers who staffed the\u000a      courts in the aftermath of the riots, and with victims of the\u000a      disturbances. This phase was completed and published by July 2012. In a\u000a      departure from standard social scientific practice a deliberate decision\u000a      was taken to publish the results of the study entirely in the newspaper,\u000a      with a short summary report [6] and an edited collection of articles [7]\u000a      being published in December 2011.\u000a    Key researcher: Professor Tim Newburn has been full time at LSE\u000a      since 2002.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40442","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Identification: Wadd's work on drinking in older people was used\u000d\u000a      in the Big Lottery fund (BLF) proposal for &#163;25 million investment to\u000d\u000a      improve evidence-based responses to problem drinking in older age (www.biglotteryfund.org.uk\/global-content\/press-releases\/uk-wide\/030613_uk_rgh_alcohol-misuse).\u000aThis\u000a      led to a request to brief Age UK, which then decided to engage with the\u000d\u000a      BLF, in partnership with Alcohol Concern and other multi disciplinary\u000d\u000a      organisations. Galvani's studies of training for social workers in\u000d\u000a      substance use have directly contributed to the higher profile of substance\u000d\u000a      use in social work education for the last decade, resulting in a\u000d\u000a      commission to write The College of Social Work's (TCSW) guidance for\u000d\u000a      social work educators on substance use for the revised qualifying\u000d\u000a      programmes in England (2012).

Specialist teams are being set up in every authority,\u000d\u000a      contributing to better preventive services for tens of thousands of\u000d\u000a      families in contact with social services in Wales. Of Forrester's six\u000d\u000a      reports for the Welsh Government, two informed policy formation and four\u000d\u000a      underpinned the roll-out of the Stronger Families reform. Forrester's work\u000d\u000a      on the outcomes for children in care led the Welsh Government to remove\u000d\u000a      the proposal that local authorities should have a legal duty to reduce the\u000d\u000a      number of children entering care, replacing it with a focus on intervening\u000d\u000a      to reduce the need for care while recognising that care can be a positive\u000d\u000a      choice. It has also influenced English policy on adoption. A Demos report\u000d\u000a      (2010) and Narey's report for the English government (2011) both\u000d\u000a      extensively quoted Forrester's research [5.1]. These reports led to\u000d\u000a      policies that increased the number of children being adopted between 2011\u000d\u000a      and 2013. Galvani's work has had a similar impact on services for families\u000d\u000a      where substance misuse is linked to domestic violence. For example,\u000d\u000a      Galvani worked with Adfam and AVA to develop resources for families on\u000d\u000a      living with substance use and domestic abuse, improving the quality and\u000d\u000a      scope of staff training [5.2, 5.3]. Forrester's work currently focuses on\u000d\u000a      creating evidence based organisations where policies and practices are\u000d\u000a      designed to produce effective helping relationships. The work involves\u000d\u000a      transformational change programmes in 6 local authorities, with current\u000d\u000a      and future impact on outcomes for the tens of thousands of vulnerable\u000d\u000a      families these authorities serve. This work informed the analysis during\u000d\u000a      early 2013 of the implications for training and education in social work,\u000d\u000a      which developed into TGC's successful tender later in 2013 for the\u000d\u000a      delivery of Frontline, a training programme aimed at increasing the skills\u000d\u000a      of qualifying social workers.\u000d\u000a    Influencing policy and practice: Galvani's research influenced the\u000d\u000a      profile of substance use teaching, including the provision of materials\u000d\u000a      for TCSW as good practice exemplars. The materials she produced with\u000d\u000a      Forrester for the Higher Education Academy (e.g. www.swapbox.ac.uk\/8\/)\u000d\u000a      were identified by the Subject Centre for Social Work and Social Policy\u000d\u000a      (SWAP) as an example of excellence in teaching. They have been distributed\u000d\u000a      to all 157 qualifying social work programmes in England. The TCSW\u000d\u000a      endorsement underpins the use of these resources in core teaching on\u000d\u000a      social work programmes in England. Galvani's work has influenced BASW's\u000d\u000a      approach to professional updating [5.4]. Each of five BASW pocket guides\u000d\u000a\u0009  (www.basw.co.uk\/group\/?id=10)\u000d\u000a      was distributed to over 20,000 social workers and other materials from\u000d\u000a      this research are being distributed to every UK qualifying programme.\u000d\u000a      Wadd's research provided a focus for a Panorama programme (Old, drunk and\u000d\u000a      disorderly? September 2012) on drinking in older people, which was seen by\u000d\u000a      an estimated 3m viewers and which contributed to the development of the\u000d\u000a      Big Lottery initiative. Forrester's research was the focus of a BBC\u000d\u000a      Scotland documentary (Home is where the hurt is, July 2009). Forrester\u000d\u000a      completed the British Association for Adoption and Fostering guidance\u000d\u000a      (Parenting a child affected by parental substance misuse, 2012) about\u000d\u000a      children affected by parental drug or alcohol issues, which is used to\u000d\u000a      improve the preparation of all prospective adopters.\u000d\u000a    Capacity development: Finally, the Centre has had an impact on the\u000d\u000a      development of greater quantitative research literacy among practitioners.\u000d\u000a      Our work has ensured that quantitative analysis plays a greater role both\u000d\u000a      in social work research and in social work education. Of particular\u000d\u000a      relevance is Forrester's lead on two current ESRC programmes to develop\u000d\u000a      and deliver a core curriculum for quantitative research in social work.\u000d\u000a      This has been incorporated into the qualifying training in 15 (of 80)\u000d\u000a      universities, influencing the research literacy and confidence in at least\u000d\u000a      770 social work students each year (or around 17% of the social work\u000d\u000a      students qualifying each year).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A high proportion of social work clients have alcohol or drug problems,\u000d\u000a      ranging from 5% in some adults services to over 70% in children's\u000d\u000a      services.

A letter from the Home Office states: \"The work of\u000d\u000a        the Department and its advocacy for, and expertise in, situational crime\u000d\u000a        prevention strategies are well known by officials responsible for Crime\u000d\u000a        policy within the Home Office and to the experts within my own area,\u000d\u000a        Home Office Science, whose task it is to ensure that we provide the best\u000d\u000a        evidence on which to base policy developments\". As an example it is\u000d\u000a      noted that \"at a recent Forum `away-day' he [Wortley] led a session on\u000d\u000a        preventing theft from the person, which is one of the only crime types\u000d\u000a        to have increased recently, and in particular focussed on the need to\u000d\u000a        convert good ideas for prevention into concrete policies and practices\"\u000d\u000a      [2].\u000d\u000a    SCS staff also have worked directly with police forces and crime\u000d\u000a        prevention agencies internationally, through continuing professional\u000d\u000a      development courses, workshops, seminars, consultancy, and the provision\u000d\u000a      of advice to provide concrete examples of how SCP and POP may be\u000d\u000a      implemented in practice. For example, in 2003 the New Zealand Police\u000d\u000a      approached researchers at the SCS for assistance with their implementation\u000d\u000a      of evidence-based crime prevention policies. Since 2008, SCS staff have\u000d\u000a      visited New Zealand on three occasions: in 2010 Laycock contributed to a\u000d\u000a      research symposium at the NZ Police College; in 2012 Chainey spent 3 weeks\u000d\u000a      delivering training courses to NZ police across the country; and in 2013,\u000d\u000a      Laycock spent a month delivering specialist workshops to police analysts\u000d\u000a      and leaders (totalling over 20 seminars and 400 participants). The New\u000d\u000a      Zealand Police explicitly credits SCS with a significant role in shaping\u000d\u000a      their crime strategies and helping to reduce crime: \"The Jill Dando\u000d\u000a        institute (JDI) has made a significant contribution to the development\u000d\u000a        of crime science and intelligence led policing in New Zealand. We are\u000d\u000a        grateful to JDI staff and associates who have increased our knowledge\u000d\u000a        base, contributed to the development of our key products and\u000d\u000a        fundamentally helped evolve the mindset within the New Zealand Police\u000d\u000a        over the last 10 years...Over the past 4 years we have achieved sizeable\u000d\u000a        reductions in crime against a backdrop of very high (and improving)\u000d\u000a        levels of public trust and confidence in Police\" [4]. The adoption\u000d\u000a      of crime science strategies has received extensive coverage in New\u000d\u000a      Zealand's media, wherein the role of the SCS is explicitly acknowledged,\u000d\u000a      arguably contributing to the reported increased levels of public\u000d\u000a      confidence in police [4].\u000d\u000a    Facilitating reductions in specific crimes\u000d\u000a    The impacts of our work on bike theft [c, d] have been\u000d\u000a      particularly significant given the emphasis placed by health authorities\u000d\u000a      and governments on promoting greater use of bicycles to improve health and\u000d\u000a      reduce congestion. The British Crime Survey (2010\/11) indicates that some\u000d\u000a      500,000 bicycles are stolen every year. The SCS\/CSM collaborative research\u000d\u000a      has had significant impacts on helping to reduce that number. Following\u000d\u000a      the demonstration of improved locking practices associated with CaMden\u000d\u000a      bike stands, manufacture of the new stands was undertaken by Broxap Ltd\u000d\u000a      who have reported that 1,202 were rolled out nationally between 2008-13\u000d\u000a      [6]. In recognition of this project, Johnson and colleagues were invited\u000d\u000a      to write a Problem Oriented Policing guide (POP Guide 52) for the US\u000d\u000a      Department of Justice POP Center on Bicycle Theft [5]. This has proven an\u000d\u000a      important source of information for national and international crime\u000d\u000a      prevention professionals operating in this area, having been downloaded\u000d\u000a      more than 11,000 times per year since its publication in 2008 (according\u000d\u000a      to popcenter.org). Bike theft became a focus for Transport for London\u000d\u000a      (TfL) and the London Metropolitan Police, and with the assistance of SCS\u000d\u000a      they undertook a prevention project. A letter from TfL [7] states: `The\u000d\u000a        academic work undertaken by the JDI became the starting point for our\u000d\u000a        cycle theft project, particularly the POP Guide 52: Bicycle Theft ....\u000d\u000a        Using a partnership approach we achieved a 5.4% decrease in cycle theft\u000d\u000a        in London during 2010\/11 (1253 fewer offences). The\u000a        approach has been recognised internationally and was awarded the 2011\u000d\u000a        Herman Goldstein (award) for Excellence in Problem Oriented Policing'.\u000d\u000a    Largely due to increased media coverage, internal child sex\u000d\u000a        trafficking has, in recent years, been widely recognised in the UK\u000d\u000a      as a pressing public issue. SCS research has challenged the perception,\u000d\u000a      dominating public debate, that internal sex trafficking is a racially\u000d\u000a      motivated crime [e, f]. Extensive media coverage of the research by, among\u000d\u000a      others, Newsnight, Huffington Post, Guardian, Independent [8], has\u000d\u000a      extended the reach of the research and informed public understanding of\u000d\u000a      the issues. Through these and other contributions to the development of a\u000d\u000a      lively national debate, the SCS research has also influenced the\u000d\u000a      formulation of national policies on tackling this issue, including the\u000d\u000a      Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) Thematic\u000d\u000a      Assessment, `Out of Mind, Out of Sight' (2011); Metropolitan Police\u000d\u000a      Authority Report on Child Sexual Exploitation (2011); and the UK National\u000d\u000a      Action Plan on Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation (2001) [9]. SCS enjoys a\u000d\u000a      fruitful relationship with SOCA (now NCA), supported both by research\u000d\u000a      student internships with the Agency and by Brayley's status (since 2013)\u000d\u000a      as a fulltime investigator. The practical value of the research is\u000d\u000a      acknowledged by the Agency: \"Of particular value in recent years has\u000d\u000a        been the work done by the Department around the topic of Internal Child\u000d\u000a        Sex Trafficking (ICST)... In 2010, SOCA actively supported two research\u000d\u000a        projects carried out by Professor Gloria Laycock with two masters\u000d\u000a        students, Ella Cockbain and Helen Brayley. One project examined the\u000d\u000a        social networks of offenders and victims and the other deconstructed the\u000d\u000a        offence into a `crime script'. The research has been influential in\u000d\u000a        helping to shape SOCA's response to ICST\" [6].\u000d\u000a    Drawing on the body of SCP research carried out within the SCS, and\u000d\u000a      working within the partnership models outlined by Tilley [a, b], staff\u000d\u000a      have shared their expert advice with police forces, crime\u000d\u000a      prevention practitioners, and criminal justice policy makers, both\u000d\u000a      domestically and abroad.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research produced by UCL's Department of Security &amp; Crime Science\u000d\u000a      (SCS) and Jill Dando Institute of Security &amp; Crime Science has been\u000d\u000a      used in the UK and internationally to shape policies and guide practices\u000d\u000a      using situational methods to prevent crime.

Research in this\u000d\u000a      field involves: (i) analysing specific crime problems in order to identify\u000d\u000a      the situational factors that enable or encourage them; (ii) devising\u000d\u000a      strategies to modify immediate environments in order to reduce\u000d\u000a      opportunities and incentives for crime; and (iii) implementing, evaluating\u000d\u000a      and, if necessary, modifying these countermeasures. Because SCP targets\u000d\u000a      the proximal causes of crime it is of great utility to police and policy\u000d\u000a      makers, who are interested in practical solutions to immediate crime\u000d\u000a      problems. The impacts described here are directed at two levels of\u000d\u000a      application and are underpinned by research conducted by Professors Shane\u000d\u000a      Johnson (UCL 2004-present), Gloria Laycock (UCL 2001-present), and Nick\u000d\u000a      Tilley (UCL 2008-present), and Dr Aiden Sidebottom (lecturer, UCL\u000d\u000a      2012-present).\u000d\u000a    (1) SCP as a general model of prevention. This line of research\u000d\u000a      aims to have SCP principles adopted as routine policy and practice in\u000d\u000a      policing and crime prevention more generally. Here, the problem-solving\u000d\u000a      method underpinning SCP is central. Tilley is a leading authority on the\u000d\u000a      delivery of SCP through Problem Oriented Policing (POP), with which it has\u000d\u000a      close affinities, and since joining UCL in 2008 he has worked with other\u000d\u000a      SCS researchers to refine the implementation of POP approaches. One study\u000d\u000a      undertook the successful implementation of a supermarket bag-theft\u000d\u000a      prevention project (involving the design of a new shopping trolley)\u000d\u000a      carried out in collaboration with Warwickshire Police and Warwickshire\u000d\u000a      Council. This project is used to argue more generally for a partnership\u000d\u000a      model in which universities can work more closely with police and other\u000d\u000a      agencies [a]. Another study surveyed 203 practitioners in order to\u000d\u000a      identify the use, and perceived strengths and weaknesses, of various\u000d\u000a      problem-solving models [b]. Drawing on these findings the authors examined\u000d\u000a      the implications for an improved problem oriented model of crime\u000d\u000a      prevention.\u000d\u000a    (2) Preventing specific forms of crime. SCP focuses on specific\u000d\u000a      forms of crime in specific contexts. We have selected two crimes &#8212; bicycle\u000d\u000a      theft and internal child sex trafficking &#8212; to illustrate our breadth,\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinarity, engagement, and impact.\u000d\u000a    Bicycle theft: A collaboration between Johnson and designers from\u000d\u000a      Central St Martin's (CSM) College of Art and Design led to the development\u000d\u000a      of strategies to help reduce bike theft (2005-2010). Johnson directed the\u000d\u000a      empirical work, analysing environmental factors contributing to bike\u000d\u000a      theft, and evaluating the efficacy of proposed solutions. In a scoping\u000d\u000a      study in 2005-06, poor locking practices were identified as a key problem\u000d\u000a      for bicycles parked in the street; existing n-shaped stands not\u000d\u000a      encouraging the locking of all components of the bicycle (wheels and\u000d\u000a      frame), with 70% of bicycles inadequately secured [c]. Based on this\u000d\u000a      research, the CaMden (M-shaped) bike stand was developed to encourage\u000d\u000a      cyclists to secure all components of their bike. Research in 2007\u000d\u000a      involving 2,268 observations found that the CaMden stands facilitated\u000d\u000a      significantly better locking practice than other prototypes and n-shaped\u000d\u000a      stands. Additional research showed that locking practices improved\u000d\u000a      significantly when correct locking instructions were posted on bike stands\u000d\u000a      [d].\u000d\u000a    Internal child sex trafficking: Research at SCS shows that those\u000d\u000a      who sexually offend against children are strongly influenced by\u000d\u000a      situational factors. Laycock, with two research students (Ella Cockbain\u000d\u000a      and Helen Brayley), worked with the Serious and Organised Crime Agency\u000d\u000a      (SOCA), now the National Crime Agency (NCA) in 2010 to apply SCP to\u000d\u000a      trafficking by groups of offenders within the UK of children for the\u000d\u000a      purposes of sexual exploitation. One study [e] examined the social\u000d\u000a      networks of offenders and victims to map connections that support the\u000d\u000a      abuse and which might be disrupted. For example, in one case they\u000d\u000a      identified an offender network built around a central ringleader and\u000d\u000a      argued that targeting this individual might dissolve the network. Another\u000d\u000a      study [f] developed a `crime script' &#8212; a detailed breakdown of the steps\u000d\u000a      involved in the crime commission process, designed to identify\u000d\u000a      `pinch-points' for prevention &#8212; for internal child sex trafficking. For\u000d\u000a      example, the identification of strategies employed by offenders to locate\u000d\u000a      and groom girls for abuse provided important insights allowing the\u000d\u000a      development of advice for potential victims on self-protection strategies.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40558","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    For a long time, police responses to crime reduction have focused on\u000d\u000a      catching offenders. This is partly due to the perception that the timing\u000d\u000a      and location of crime events is not predictable and, even if it were, the\u000d\u000a      police and others have commonly questioned the idea that place-based\u000d\u000a      strategies actually reduce crime, assuming that crimes prevented at one\u000d\u000a      location will simply be `displaced' to others. More generally, the\u000d\u000a      practical value of academic research in policing has often been questioned\u000d\u000a      by practitioners. However, our research on crime prediction has shown that\u000d\u000a      prediction is possible and practicable, our systematic review of research\u000d\u000a      concerned with crime displacement has dispelled the myth that place-based\u000d\u000a      crime prevention merely displaces crime, and our applied research has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the value of academic research in practice.\u000d\u000a    Through presentations at over 50 practitioner events (including the\u000d\u000a      Government of Alberta's 2007 international conference on crime reduction,\u000d\u000a      which informed [11]), our continuing professional development courses\u000d\u000a      (over 300 practitioners at 30 courses, 2008-2013), and participation on\u000d\u000a      advisory boards and direct knowledge transfer activities, our research has\u000d\u000a      challenged accepted wisdom and substantially influenced policy and\u000d\u000a        practitioner discourse.\u000d\u000a    Research has had substantial media coverage, which both reinforces and\u000d\u000a      demonstrates its influence on discourse. This has included, for example,\u000d\u000a      articles in the New Scientist (3 May 2008, readership 736k per\u000d\u000a      issue), on the BBC News website (9 September 2011, &gt;160m page views per\u000d\u000a      month), and TV coverage on the BBC breakfast news (18 September 2012,\u000d\u000a      viewership ~1.1m) [1].\u000d\u000a    In the UK, research contributions to policy discussion and impact on\u000d\u000a      police action were recognised at every level. Examples include:\u000d\u000a    - In May 2012, Chainey was called as expert witness by the\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary Select Committee on Public Accounts to provide evidence on\u000d\u000a      the use and impact of online crime mapping for their Implementation of the\u000d\u000a      Transparency Agenda. His testimony led to the recommendation that they\u000d\u000a      publish better quality and more useable data [2].\u000d\u000a    - An independent report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies\u000d\u000a      (HMIC) acknowledged SCS research as the basis for pioneering work\u000d\u000a      employing predictive mapping; a Police Federation article noted our\u000d\u000a      research has informed police practice; while Johnson's\u000d\u000a      participation on advisory panels led to an invited contribution in 2012 to\u000d\u000a      HMIC briefing materials for newly elected Police Crime Commissioners on\u000d\u000a      what works to reduce crime [3].\u000d\u000a    - The UK College of Policing (formerly the National Police Improvement\u000d\u000a      Agency, NPIA), for whom Johnson contributed to the 2012 NPIA\u000d\u000a      Masterclass on predictive policing, argue that our work has directly\u000d\u000a      changed the way the police perform hotspot analyses in practice,\u000d\u000a      stimulated debate on how this analysis can be effectively used, challenged\u000d\u000a      conventional wisdom held by those in law enforcement concerning (say)\u000d\u000a      crime displacement, and informed the future of predictive crime analysis\u000d\u000a      [4].\u000d\u000a    - Locally, in addition to the changes of practice described below,\u000d\u000a      Greater Manchester Police note that departmental research has changed\u000d\u000a      police attitudes to the value of academic research [5].\u000d\u000a    The global reach of this influence is demonstrated by:\u000d\u000a    - Discussion of our research in the 2012 Digest of the International\u000d\u000a      Association of Crime Analysts (members in 47 countries) focusing on key\u000d\u000a      academic work on hot-spots policing, and in an Australian Institute of\u000d\u000a      Criminology (a government agency) brief on using geographical analysis to\u000d\u000a      prevent crime [6].\u000d\u000a    - In the United States, the National Institute for Justice recognised the\u000d\u000a      importance of our work by funding Professor Jerry Ratcliffe (Temple\u000d\u000a      University, $95k) to develop \"the near repeat calculator\" [7] which\u000d\u000a      implements some of the algorithms developed as part of our research.\u000d\u000a    Research at SCS has influenced police practice in the UK and police\u000d\u000a        forces internationally, as well as community groups concerned with\u000d\u000a        neighbourhood security. This has led to reduced crime in target\u000d\u000a        areas, and initiatives have subsequently been extended or imitated\u000d\u000a      elsewhere.\u000d\u000a    In the UK, based on our research and with support from departmental staff\u000d\u000a      [5], Greater Manchester Police (GMP) implemented a predictive mapping\u000d\u000a      approach to help reduce burglary in Trafford (population 226,578) [5] in\u000d\u000a      2010. Predictive maps are used to direct police patrols and, where\u000d\u000a      feasible, staff from other agencies not usually engaged in crime reduction\u000d\u000a      (e.g. police driving instructors, and the fire service) to provide\u000d\u000a      guardianship where (and when) it is predicted to be most needed. This\u000d\u000a      innovative and successful intervention was recognised by the HMIC as\u000d\u000a      having scope for wider adoption [8]. Evaluation results [5] show a 38%\u000d\u000a      reduction in burglary (471 fewer victims of burglary) in the area of\u000d\u000a      implementation over a two-year interval. Inspired by departmental research\u000d\u000a      [e] on other crimes, GMP extended the approach to other high volume\u000d\u000a      offences, reporting a 29% reduction in theft from motor vehicle\u000d\u000a      [5]. These projects were recognised internationally: the team were\u000d\u000a      finalists in the US Goldstein Problem Oriented Policing awards 2012, and\u000d\u000a      nominated by the Home Office for the 2012 European Crime Prevention\u000d\u000a      awards.\u000d\u000a    Similar interventions have been implemented elsewhere with comparable\u000d\u000a      results. For example, in 2012 in North West Leeds (population 321,000),\u000d\u000a      which had previously experienced the highest burglary rate in the country,\u000d\u000a      West Yorkshire police reported a 48% decrease in burglary accompanied by\u000d\u000a      increased public confidence in the police [9]. Other UK police forces\u000d\u000a      implemented similar approaches in 2008-2013, including Kent, West Mercia,\u000d\u000a      and the Metropolitan police.\u000d\u000a    In North Lincolnshire, with Home Office funding and assistance from Johnson,\u000d\u000a      the Safer Neighbourhoods Team developed the Vigilance Modeller, a software\u000d\u000a      application based on Bowers and Johnson's early predictive\u000d\u000a      mapping work. This is used to prioritise areas for crime prevention in\u000d\u000a      North Lincolnshire (population 167,400) and it was distributed to over 400\u000d\u000a      community safety partnerships in the UK in 2010. Initially developed for\u000d\u000a      use by community safety teams (not the police), in 2011 this software was\u000d\u000a      used by Humberside Police to catch a prolific burglary team [10].\u000d\u000a    The reach of these impacts has been expanded overseas both directly and\u000d\u000a      through research by others. Community safety organisations implemented\u000d\u000a      successful interventions based on our work.\u000d\u000a    In Edmonton (Canada) a Neighbourhood Empowerment Team (NET) developed the\u000d\u000a      Notification of Community Crime (NOCC) intervention to increase community\u000d\u000a      empowerment to reduce crime. As part of the programme, youth volunteers\u000d\u000a      visit burglary victims and their neighbours to deliver crime prevention\u000d\u000a      advice and kits. Following recommendations from departmental research,\u000d\u000a      teams deliver advice and kits as swiftly as possible. First implemented in\u000d\u000a      2009, this intervention is ongoing in three NET neighbourhoods and had \"a\u000d\u000a      substantial impact on rates of residential burglary\" &#8212; e.g. reducing\u000d\u000a      burglary by 66% in a six-month interval in the Bonnie Doon NET area (pop.\u000d\u000a      5000) [11].\u000d\u000a    Following invited presentations by Bowers (an update of [b]) and\u000d\u000a      Johnson (a version of [f]) in Jan 2007, researchers at UCLA\u000d\u000a      published an article on predictive mapping in 2011 that built on our work\u000d\u000a      on crime prediction (citing 4 of our papers including [b,f,c] seven times\u000d\u000a      in the article). This led to a US spin out company (predpol.com) that has\u000d\u000a      developed commercially available predictive mapping software, grounded in\u000d\u000a      the principles set out in our research [a,b,e,f]. Their algorithm refined\u000d\u000a      our approach by incorporating an estimate of the time-stable risk of crime\u000d\u000a      at locations (discussed in [b,f]) and better calibrating the way in which\u000d\u000a      the risk of crime is predicted to spread (see [f]). Use of this product by\u000d\u000a      the police is reported to have resulted in crime reductions of 14% and 27%\u000d\u000a      respectively in areas of Los Angeles and Santa Cruz [12].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on spatial patterns of crime at UCL has influenced police\u000d\u000a      practice and has informed policy and its implementation in countries\u000d\u000a      including Australia, Canada, UK, and USA.

Research on spatial patterns of crime began when Spencer Chainey\u000d\u000a      joined the department (part of the UCL Jill Dando Institute of Crime\u000d\u000a      Science) in 2003. Research on space-time] patterns commenced in 2004 when\u000d\u000a      Professors Kate Bowers and Shane Johnson arrived.\u000d\u000a    Between 2004 and 2009, Johnson and Bowers led a British\u000d\u000a      Academy-funded international collaboration between researchers at UCL, the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands Centre for the study of Crime and Law Enforcement (Amsterdam,\u000d\u000a      Netherlands), and Temple University (Philadelphia, USA) to study\u000d\u000a      space-time patterns of crime in different countries. The research showed\u000d\u000a      that across cities in five different countries (see [a] in section 3) the\u000d\u000a      risk of burglary spreads in space and time much like a disease, with a\u000d\u000a      regularity that makes it amenable to prediction. Further research,\u000d\u000a      conducted as part of this collaboration showed that this extended to\u000d\u000a      improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in Iraq. Departmental research\u000d\u000a      has shown this to be the case for a range of other crime types including\u000d\u000a      theft from motor vehicles, cash in transit robbery, riots, and even\u000d\u000a      maritime piracy. With respect to burglary, we demonstrated that novel\u000d\u000a      predictive models based on our findings outperform alternative methods\u000d\u000a      [b]. And, with a view to assessing the utility of predictive approaches\u000d\u000a      more generally, we conducted the first reviews of the predictive accuracy\u000d\u000a      of traditional methods of crime mapping [c], and showed that &#8212; in contrast\u000d\u000a      to conventional wisdom &#8212; geographically focused police initiatives do not\u000d\u000a      displace crime [d].\u000d\u000a    Underlying the research on the space-time dynamics of crime, and the\u000d\u000a      forecasting method developed, is the hypothesis &#8212; developed at UCL &#8212; that\u000d\u000a      offenders adopt `foraging' strategies at least some of the time, seeking\u000d\u000a      to maximise the benefit of their activity whilst minimising search time\u000d\u000a      and associated risks [b, e]. As such, burglars (for example) are predicted\u000d\u000a      to return to previously victimised homes\/locations (repeat victimisation)\u000d\u000a      when the benefits outweigh the risks, and nearby places that share similar\u000d\u000a      characteristics (near repeat victimisation). With further British Academy\u000d\u000a      funding (2007-2008) Johnson directed a study that used computer\u000d\u000a      simulation, quantitative and qualitative methods to test this hypothesis.\u000d\u000a      The analysis of crimes detected by the police [e] facilitated the study of\u000d\u000a      patterns of observed offender spatial choices; computer simulation (e.g.\u000d\u000a      [f]) &#8212; a generative modelling approach which allows theoretical models to\u000d\u000a      be formalised and tested in silico &#8212; was used to test and assess competing\u000d\u000a      theories; and, qualitative research interviews with offenders provided a\u000d\u000a      \"bottom-up\" approach to further develop understanding of offender spatial\u000d\u000a      decision-making. The findings, generated using very different research\u000d\u000a      methods that are rarely used together, support the offender as forager\u000d\u000a      hypothesis and provided insights relevant to the crime reduction\u000d\u000a      enterprise.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40639","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nature of the Impact: The Dementia UK report (2)\u000a      highlighted widespread problems with care\u000a      arrangements for people with dementia, and set in train a process that led\u000a      to the National\u000a        Dementia Strategy for England (A). Dementia UK received\u000a      substantial national and international\u000a      media coverage (including lead story on BBC TV and radio news on launch\u000a      day (February 2007)).\u000a      The (then) National Clinical Director and co-author of the Strategy\u000a      reflected: `In the UK, the\u000a      process [of policy action] was initiated by the Alzheimer's Society\u000a      commissioning an independent\u000a      report from the LSE and the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College\u000a      London, entitled: The Dementia\u000a        UK report' (B). The new prevalence and cost projections, the\u000a      evidence on care variations across\u000a      the country, and the case for improving service quality were among\u000a      findings of Dementia UK\u000a      heavily cited by the NAO (C), prompting the Government to develop its 2009\u000a      National Strategy (A)\u000a      and its 2010 regulatory impact assessment (D). Dementia UK\u000a      continues to be widely cited, e.g. in\u000a      the NAO's 2010 follow-up report (E), the 2010 Public Health White Paper\u000a      (F) and the 2011 Mental\u000a      Health Strategy (G).\u000a    The Prime Minister's Challenge on Dementia built directly on the\u000a      2009 National Strategy; in\u000a      launching it, David Cameron quoted from Dementia UK (H). A recent\u000a      progress report on the PM's\u000a      Challenge twice cited the report (I). Outside England, the report\u000a      has informed policy discussions\u000a      by, for example, the World Health Organization (J). The Unit was also\u000a      commissioned by the All\u000a      Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia to review evidence on cost-effective\u000a      dementia care; this\u000a      report again cites Dementia UK (K). By bringing together robust\u000a      evidence and analysis on many\u000a      topics, Dementia UK highlighted practice challenges for a future\u000a      that will be heavily influenced by a\u000a      rapidly ageing world population, and has directly informed the development\u000a      of policy.\u000a    The Unit's modelling of the economic consequences of common mental\u000a      disorders and their\u000a      treatment with psychological therapies (5) started in 2004 and\u000a      influenced the Labour Party's\u000a      decision to make access to psychological therapy (specifically CBT) a\u000a      manifesto commitment in\u000a      2005. Following the General Election, this became a major plank of health\u000a      policy: the\u000a      Government's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)\u000a      programme started with ten\u000a      pathfinder sites in 2006\/07 and was followed by 32 implementation sites in\u000a      2008\/09 (with &#163;173m\u000a      invested over three years). The Unit's 2011 report on mental health\u000a      promotion and mental illness\u000a      prevention (6) was subsequently cited in a Coalition Government document\u000a      that supported the\u000a      extension of IAPT with &#163;400m over a further four years (L). The IAPT is\u000a      widely viewed as a\u000a      success in greatly improving access to evidence-based psychotherapy for\u000a      people with mental\u000a      health needs, thereby improving their quality of life and reducing\u000a      workplace absenteeism,\u000a      unemployment and long-term NHS costs.\u000a    The Unit's work on costs and economic pay-offs from fifteen separate\u000a      interventions (6) and on\u000a      community capacity-building (8) provided key inputs to the Government's\u000a      2011 mental health\u000a      strategy for England, which was intended to promote mental health and\u000a        prevent mental\u000a        disorder. The accompanying impact assessment (G) cited this research\u000a      heavily: `The best practice\u000a      examples presented in this Strategy are based on analytical work done by\u000a      the London School of\u000a      Economics' (p.14). The impact assessment used 9 of the 15 economic models\u000a      in the Unit's report\u000a      (6) and another 2 models from parallel work (8). A further DH document\u000a      explored the economic\u000a      case for improving efficiency and quality in mental health through the\u000a      Government's new policy\u000a      framework (M); 26 of 99 citations in the document were to PSSRU research.\u000a      The report (6) was\u000a      cited in guidance for general practitioners published by the NHS\u000a      Confederation jointly with a\u000a      number of mental health charities and service providers (N) and heavily\u000a      cited by the Joint\u000a      Commissioning Panel for Mental Health (O). Along with other work by the\u000a      Unit, the 2011\u000a      programme of research was also cited in the Mental Health Strategy for\u000a        Scotland 2012-2015 (P).\u000a    The Unit's research on suicide prevention (part of ref. 6) was used in\u000a      the Coalition Government's\u000a      suicide prevention strategy for England, which, when citing the Unit's\u000a      work, noted that `suicide\u000a      prevention education for GPs ... has the potential to be cost-effective if\u000a      it leads to adequate\u000a      subsequent treatment' (Q, p.17). The research is also reaching\u000a      policy-makers internationally; e.g.,\u000a      it was highlighted in a WHO report to justify investing in mental health\u000a      (R); the Unit was invited to\u000a      present its work to European Parliamentary Committees (S); and to draft a\u000a      background report for a\u000a      `High Level EU\/German Government Conference' on mental health promotion in\u000a      workplaces (T).\u000a      Across the full programme, PSSRU's research has provided strong support\u000a      for introducing,\u000a      expanding or protecting (in the face of budget cuts) a range of\u000a      interventions that have considerable\u000a      potential to improve mental health and wellbeing.\u000a    Wider Implications: At any one time, mental health problems affect\u000a      at least one in six adults; for\u000a      half these people the problem will last longer than one year. Consequences\u000a      include enormous\u000a      distress for the individuals and families concerned, damaged life chances,\u000a      disproportionately high\u000a      contributions to total disability burden, and huge economic impacts\u000a      through lost or disrupted\u000a      employment and the costs of treatment and care. The Unit's research has\u000a      contributed to the\u000a      development of policy frameworks and practice responses by offering robust\u000a      economic evidence to\u000a      help decision-makers achieve bigger and fairer impacts from available\u000a      societal resources.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on the economic case for interventions to prevent mental\u000a      illness, to address mental\u000a      health needs and to promote mental wellbeing has been conducted by the\u000a      Personal Social\u000a      Services Research Unit (PSSRU) in the LSE Health and Social Care group\u000a      with demonstrable\u000a      impact on government policy in England and beyond.

The Unit costed some `Actions' recommended by the External Reference\u000a      Group for the\u000a      National Dementia Strategy in England, working alongside the\u000a      National Clinical Director, Sube\u000a      Banerjee (4).\u000a    In partnership with Richard Layard at the LSE's Centre for Economic\u000a      Performance (and with some\u000a      input from David Clark, Oxford University), the PSSRU evaluated the\u000a      economic impacts of\u000a      widening access to psychological therapies, particularly cognitive\u000a      behaviour therapy (CBT) for\u000a      common mental disorders (5). Analyses showed the overwhelming economic\u000a      case for improving\u000a      access to evidence-based therapies. Subsequent research demonstrated a\u000a      strong economic case\u000a      for CBT in other contexts (6).\u000a    The Unit also examined the economic case for investing in the promotion\u000a        of mental health and\u000a        prevention of mental disorder (with small inputs from KCL),\u000a      analysing the level and distribution of\u000a      costs and economic pay-offs of fifteen mental health interventions for the\u000a      DH (6). Each intervention\u000a      was already accepted as effective (in terms of disorder prevention,\u000a      symptom alleviation or\u000a      improved quality of life). The Unit's new research, conducted in close\u000a      association with government\u000a      officials and others, built economic models to examine whether\u000a      interventions were cost-effective\u000a      and affordable. Areas examined included: parenting programmes to address\u000a      persistent child anti-social\u000a      behaviour; early detection and early intervention for psychosis; primary\u000a      care screening and\u000a      brief intervention for alcohol misuse; early diagnosis and treatment of\u000a      common mental disorders in\u000a      the workplace; debt counselling; collaborative care for depression in\u000a      individuals with diabetes;\u000a      treatment of medically unexplained symptoms; and befriending of older\u000a      adults. Modelling for each\u000a      area showed a strong economic case for the interventions examined. For\u000a      example, parenting\u000a      programmes generate economic benefits over many years and sectors (better\u000a      health, less crime,\u000a      less substance misuse). Workplace screening and treatment is\u000a      cost-beneficial for employers as\u000a      well as the Exchequer. Findings on early intervention for psychosis (6)\u000a      reinforced messages from\u000a      previously influential PSSRU research (7) that specialist teams save the\u000a      NHS and wider economy\u000a      substantial sums of money, while improving health and quality of life. A\u000a      parallel study\u000a      commissioned by the DH examined community capacity-building initiatives,\u000a      finding that community\u000a      navigators, time banks and befriending schemes encourage volunteering,\u000a      increase employment\u000a      and meet social care needs, each generating economic benefits (8).\u000a    Key researchers: Martin Knapp (LSE since January 1996, .8 FTE),\u000a      David McDaid (since January\u000a      1997, .5 FTE), Raphael Wittenberg (since January 1996, .5 FTE), Adelina\u000a      Comas-Herrera (since\u000a      January 1996, .8 FTE).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40790","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nature of the Impact: Munro's research led to an invitation from\u000a      the Secretary of State for Education to undertake a review of child\u000a      protection in England. Her first report [A] analysed how different factors\u000a      had interacted to create a system that was risk averse, focusing on rules,\u000a      process and compliance rather than on its impact on children. Her analysis\u000a      was corroborated by feedback from the sector and subsequent reports\u000a      developed solutions [B,C,D]. Munro's final report [B] made 15\u000a      recommendations [BRec1-15] that sought to introduce change at several\u000a      points in the system: the ultimate aim was to move from a compliance\u000a      culture involving performance indicators to a learning culture, with\u000a      evidence about the impact on children becoming the key driver of practice.\u000a      The recommendations, building on key themes identified in Munro's\u000a      research, have all been accepted [E, F] impacting on legislation, policy\u000a      and practice.\u000a    Organisational change: A recommendation for a new inspection\u000a      framework [BRec3: implemented 04\/12[G]], shifts the emphasis from data\u000a      about process to evidence of the quality of work and its impact on\u000a      children. It requires local authorities (LAs) to gather feedback from\u000a      users and provide evidence of impact as part of their monitoring.\u000a      Prescribed statutory timescales for some processes at the beginning of the\u000a      family's contact with the child protection system have been removed\u000a      (implemented 05\/13[H]), the aim being to reduce the dominance they had\u000a      acquired in determining priorities. LAs and other children's services are\u000a      now required to monitor the child's journey through the system. Inspectors\u000a      will also observe practice and talk to workers and users so that judgments\u000a      are not based on written records alone.\u000a    Given the distorting effects of performance indicators, with agencies\u000a      merely seeking to score well, and not necessarily provide a high quality\u000a      of service, new performance information was recommended [BRec4]\u000a      (implemented 04\/12[I]). A mixture of national and local data is now\u000a      provided which must be interrogated before a judgment on quality of\u000a      performance is formed. Interaction between many professions and agencies\u000a      is required for the child protection system to function. A further\u000a      recommendation [BRec3] focused on conducting joint inspections; this is to\u000a      commence, in a modified form, in 2013-14 [J]. Revised statutory guidance\u000a      [H] also includes a requirement that Local Safeguarding Children's Boards\u000a      should include an assessment of the effectiveness of the help provided\u000a      [BRec6]. Creating a culture of shared acceptance of the inherent\u000a      uncertainty in making predictions about children's futures is also vital:\u000a      Ministerial statements reflect this uncertainty [K] as does the wording in\u000a      new statutory guidance [H].\u000a    With the changes in guidance, inspection and performance information,\u000a      children's social care departments are now required to give more attention\u000a      to the quality of help they are providing rather than focusing on\u000a      performance indicators. At least 50 LAs have radically redesigned their\u000a      work to improve the focus on helping families [D].\u000a    Professional expertise: Munro's recommendations have sought to\u000a      increase flexibility so that professionals can respond to the varied needs\u000a      and circumstances of children and families, and adapt their practices\u000a      having learned about their impact. The revised statutory guidance [BRec1]\u000a      (implemented 01\/13[H]) includes a radical reduction in prescription,\u000a      limiting it to essential rules for professional co-operation, with\u000a      responsibility for professional guidance being left to the professions. It\u000a      also replaces timescales with judgements of timeliness plus quality. The\u000a      Government has also decommissioned the former electronic Common Assessment\u000a      Form, so that local areas can adapt assessment frameworks to meet their\u000a      own needs [L]. The aim is to make it easier for organisations to create\u000a      the working conditions for improving professional expertise when working\u000a      with families.\u000a    Munro was also asked to pay particular attention to improving social\u000a      work, building on the work of the Social Work Taskforce (2009). Drawing on\u000a      her research on professional reasoning and the development of expertise in\u000a      basic training and later practice, a capabilities framework for child and\u000a      family social work has been developed by the College of Social Work\u000a      [BRec11] [M]. The Government has additionally published expectations for\u000a      HEI\/employer partnerships regarding the quality of placements for trainee\u000a      social workers [BRec12] [N].\u000a    For social work, improving expertise requires a change in career options\u000a      with a route to seniority in which staff can remain involved in direct\u000a      work and be rewarded for becoming more skilled. LAs are now required to\u000a      appoint a Principal Child and Family Social Worker at a senior level who\u000a      is still actively engaged with direct practice [BRec14]. This\u000a      recommendation has also been taken up in adult social care: the Care and\u000a      Support White Paper [O] proposes that all LAs should appoint a Principal\u000a      Social Worker for adult services. The Government has additionally created\u000a      posts of Chief Social Worker [BRec15) for both children's and adult social\u000a      work to improve the skills and role of the profession.\u000a    Munro's work has had impact beyond England. The Isle of Man is taking\u000a      forward her work to improve childcare services [P]. In Australia, she gave\u000a      evidence to reviews of child protection in state governments in Victoria\u000a      and New South Wales; and in Queensland, a charity is running a `Munro\u000a      campaign' to persuade the state government to learn from her work [Q].\u000a    Wider Implications: Protecting children from maltreatment is an\u000a      important task. The English child protection system was in need of major\u000a      reform as it had become dominated by a `blame culture' in which compliance\u000a      with procedures outweighed a focus on children's needs. The reforms that\u000a      have been introduced as a result of the work of the Unit are leading to\u000a      significant cultural changes and expertise in helping children, with\u000a      evidence about the impact of services on children now being prioritised\u000a      which should improve the quality of help provided and so assist with\u000a      improving the welfare of children.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Unit's work has had a direct impact on the child protection system in\u000a      England. In 2010, the Secretary of State for Education invited Eileen\u000a      Munro to review the child protection system, giving her a wide remit\u000a      enabling her to address systemic factors (such as the inspection\u000a      framework, statutory guidance and performance management systems) as well\u000a      as front line practice. All 15 recommendations of her final 2011 report\u000a      [B] have been accepted and are being implemented. Munro's research has had\u000a      significant reach: she has given evidence to two state government reviews\u000a      of child protection in Australia; and in Queensland a charity is running a\u000a      campaign to persuade the state government to learn from her work.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    London School of Economics and Political Science\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London School of Economics and Political Science","InstitutionName":"London School of Economics & Political Science","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004063}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] Munro, E.

She began by studying individual errors then broadened\u000a      out to look at how factors in the wider system interact to influence the\u000a      quality of performance. Her work was brought together in: `Learning to\u000a      reduce risk in child protection' [1]. In this she argued that system-wide\u000a      changes were needed. Her conclusion was informed by research relating to\u000a      professional errors, reasoning and organisational factors.\u000a    Munro's initial research interest in professional errors involved an\u000a      analysis of child abuse inquiry reports, and used a framework of common\u000a      errors identified by psychological research. She found that criticisms of\u000a      professional practice could be classified according to this framework. Her\u000a      work offered a deeper understanding of how errors occurred, illustrated\u000a      how they manifested themselves in child protection work, and outlined\u000a      organisational changes needed to minimise their occurrence. These related\u000a      in particular to professional supervision and the need for a culture\u000a      whereby revising a judgement, in light of new evidence or critical\u000a      challenge, was seen as good practice [2].\u000a    However, feedback from child protection workers revealed that they found\u000a      it difficult to implement Munro's proposals. This led her to study how\u000a      intuitive and analytic thinking and emotions played a part in practice.\u000a      Drawing on research in the fields of psychology and psycho-neurology, her\u000a      book `Effective Child Protection' [3] outlined an approach to risk\u000a      assessment and decision making encompassing three dimensions of reasoning:\u000a      intuitive, analytical and emotional. This work also emphasised how\u000a      expertise is developed, requiring experience, feedback and reflection.\u000a    Further feedback from practitioners and managers led Munro to see that\u000a      their practice was additionally constrained by organisational factors such\u000a      as performance management and a culture that had become risk-averse and\u000a      defensive. This led her to focus on the organisational context to explore\u000a      how it influenced priorities and practices. She drew on the systems\u000a      approach to accident investigation adopted in engineering to develop a\u000a      systems approach to child protection [4]. She subsequently trialled and\u000a      developed, in conjunction with the Social Care Institute for Excellence a\u000a      model of child protection as socio-technical system (akin to that in\u000a      aviation but adapted due to the different balance between social and\u000a      technical elements and the complex relationships in child protection) [5].\u000a    Munro's work has sought to address the crucial issue of organisational\u000a      complexity further. Building on the systems approach in case reviews, she\u000a      has explored the multiple factors in organisations that influence the\u000a      quality of work and analysed how factors such as the inspection process\u000a      [6], the performance management system (including targets and levels of\u000a      regulation), the computer software, and the level of public criticism in\u000a      child protection have cumulatively created an over-bureaucratised,\u000a      defensive, compliance culture, where the focus on helping children has\u000a      become obscured [7].In her 2010 paper [1] which brought together these key\u000a      themes, Munro concluded that systemic reform of the child protection\u000a      system was needed, in particular with respect to:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aOrganisational change: The focus on performance management and\u000a        targets needed to change to one focused on the needs of the child; more\u000a        interaction between professionals was needed; and uncertainty had to be\u000a        accepted.\u000a      \u000aProfessional expertise: Professional expertise and reasoning\u000a        needed to improve; and learning opportunities needed to be provided.\u000a    \u000a    Key Researcher: Professor Munro has been at LSE since 1993.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40905","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3374084","Name":"Barbados"},{"GeoNamesId":"3508796","Name":"Dominican Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"3439705","Name":"Uruguay"},{"GeoNamesId":"3703430","Name":"Panama"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"3489940","Name":"Jamaica"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Hedderman's initial analysis of reconviction in the East Midlands\u000a      demonstrated that the MoJ method for comparing different probation areas,\u000a      which was based on caseload rather than commencement samples, was a poorer\u000a      measure of reoffending than other existing reconviction measures (2).\u000a      Initially, the MoJ changed their measure to make some allowance for the\u000a      length of time offenders were under supervision, but they resisted making\u000a      more substantive changes. Subsequently, the government's position changed.\u000a      This reflected pressure from within and outside the Probation Service\u000a      following the dissemination of the results of Hedderman's second study\u000a      (with Jolliffe). For example, the study was cited in a House of Lords\u000a      debate in 2010 and showcased in an invited presentation to the Probation\u000a      Chiefs Association National Conference in 2011. Hedderman was then invited\u000a      to give evidence before the Justice Select Committee's inquiry into the\u000a      Probation Service in 2011 which led to the Justice Select Committee (A\u000a      p.114) being able to 'welcome the MoJ's review of the local snapshot\u000a      measure of re-offending...' and the MoJ (B p.31) responding that they were\u000a      'investigating whether meaningful data on the re-offending of offenders\u000a      supervised by individual probation trusts can be produced after\u000a      controlling for changes in offender characteristics'.\u000a    In 2011 the MoJ created a new local 'proven reoffending' measure which is\u000a      based on commencement samples and includes pre-court disposals which again\u000a      increases the degree to which the measure assesses underlying offending\u000a      behaviour rather than criminal justice processing decisions. Ultimately\u000a      this measure is expected to form the basis of a replacement for the\u000a      current probation performance measure.\u000a    A number of Probation areas subsequently contacted Hedderman for advice\u000a      on how to use reconviction information to improve the work they do with\u000a      offenders to reduce reoffending. This led to formal consultancies with\u000a      three Probation Trusts:\u000a    &#163;10,350 (ex VAT) commencing 2010, Kent Probation Trust.\u000a    &#163;19,000 (ex VAT) commencing 2012, London Probation Trust (renewed April\u000a      2013 for the same amount for a further year).\u000a    &#163;10,450 (ex VAT) commencing 2013, Hertfordshire Probation Trust.\u000a    The work for Kent Probation Trust involved Hedderman and Jolliffe\u000a      analysing reconviction data to identify ways to improve their work on\u000a      reducing reoffending. In 2012, Hedderman was appointed as Research Advisor\u000a      to London Probation Trust (which manages 20% of all offenders under\u000a      probation supervision) to advise them on which further analyses to conduct\u000a      in relation to reoffending (as well as other matters). This relationship\u000a      proved so valuable to them that this consultancy was renewed in April 2013\u000a      for a further year (C).\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    Since the results were provided, reoffending rates in the East Midlands\u000a      Region (even using the Government's preferred measure) have outperformed\u000a      the predicted level (8.76% proven reoffending as opposed to a predicted\u000a      figure of 9.03% in the most recent year) (E).\u000a    Hedderman and Jolliffe were also invited to be the key note speakers at a\u000a      specially convened seminar `Sentencing and reducing reoffending: some\u000a      reflections on the British Experience' in Santiago, Chile on 5 July 2011.\u000a      The event was sponsored by the British Embassy in Chile, the Chilean\u000a      Ministry of Justice and Chilean Public Criminal Defender. Hedderman was\u000a      subsequently appointed advisor to a project funded by the Organisation of\u000a      the American States (OAS) to develop outcome measures for comparing the\u000a      impact of prison and community-based interventions across a number of\u000a      countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (Chile, Uruguay, Costa Rica,\u000a      Barbados, Panama, Dominican Republic and Jamaica). In May 2013, the OAS\u000a      Director of the Department of Public Security wrote to Hedderman noting\u000a      that OAS 'are convinced that this project will make a significant\u000a      contribution to the efforts of our Member States' (F).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In the mid-2000s the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) devised a new measure to\u000a      compare area variations in reconviction rates across the Probation Service\u000a      in England and Wales so that these differences could be taken into account\u000a      when allocating resources. A number of Probation Trust Chief Executives\u000a      have used Hedderman's research successfully to argue for revisions to the\u000a      reconviction 'performance measure'.

For example, the range in 2010 for those commencing\u000a      supervision was from 26.6% in Warwickshire to 44.7% in Durham and Tees\u000a      Valley. However, before these figures can be interpreted as evidence of\u000a      differences in their effectiveness, the extent to which areas supervise\u000a      different types of people needs to be taken into account. A further\u000a      difficulty is that there are no simple, agreed ways of measuring\u000a      reoffending although, over time, best practice lessons have developed (1).\u000a      Hedderman (who joined the Department of Criminology as Professor in 2004)\u000a      conducted analyses which showed that the performance measure developed by\u000a      the MoJ failed to fully reflect those lessons. Consequently, it did not\u000a      produce fair or useful comparisons between areas; nor did the results help\u000a      Probation Trusts to understand what they could do to improve their\u000a      performance.\u000a    Hedderman's previous work on sentencing and reoffending (1) led the five\u000a      East Midlands Probation areas (Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland,\u000a      Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire) to commission her in\u000a      2006 to investigate why they had different reoffending rates to each\u000a      other, and why these changed over time, so that they could target their\u000a      efforts to reduce reoffending more effectively. They also wanted expert\u000a      advice on how fairly the MoJ measure assessed their performance.\u000a    Based on a quantitative analysis of just under 50,000 probation and\u000a      police records, the initial analysis of East Midland's data demonstrated\u000a      that the MoJ method (based on caseload rather than commencement samples)\u000a      was a poorer measure of reoffending than other existing reconviction\u000a      measures (2). It undercounted those on orders of less than three months\u000a      and over-counted those who were at low risk of reoffending (having been on\u000a      the caseload for very long periods without doing so). Variations in these\u000a      factors between areas were not taken into account, leading to unfair\u000a      comparisons being drawn between areas. The measure also created perverse\u000a      incentives. For example, a Trust could improve its performance by\u000a      encouraging the courts to use short prison sentences which were not\u000a      included in the calculations. Not only are such sentences more expensive\u000a      in financial terms, they may increase rather than decrease the risk of\u000a      further offending (3).\u000a    These criticisms led the MoJ to amend their preferred measure to include\u000a      a variable which took account of the differing lengths of time offenders\u000a      were under supervision. However, they argued against replacing the measure\u000a      on the grounds that their approach was the only practical one. To combat\u000a      this claim the same five areas commissioned a new reoffending study from\u000a      Hedderman and Jolliffe (who worked at the Department of Criminology as a\u000a      Senior Lecturer until 2012). Based on a sample of over 9,000 cases, this\u000a      study demonstrated that it was both practical and preferable to adopt a\u000a      conventional longitudinal approach by taking quarterly samples of cases\u000a      commencing supervision. In line with best practice in the field of\u000a      reoffending studies, this approach focused on the period when the risk of\u000a      reoffending was greatest (within six months of commencing supervision).\u000a      The longer follow-up timescale minimised the impact of factors such as\u000a      variations in court processing times so the results were a more genuine\u000a      measure of underlying offending behaviour. Using this approach it was also\u000a      possible to identify action which might be taken to reduce reoffending.\u000a      For example, one area was advised to speed up first appointments and\u000a      another is now targeting those convicted of theft offences with employment\u000a      and debt advice services.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40938","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research has led to new guidelines, setting admissions\u000a          standards to almost all social work courses, resulting in\u000a          better quality candidates.\u000a    \u000a      \u000aInfluencing policy: The research findings [see Section 3, R6\u000a        &amp; R7] informed national discussions between 2008 and 2012.

Furthermore,\u000a        `Perceptions are that this work is positively influencing the calibre of\u000a        entrants...there is also now a focus on quality over quantity' [C1].This\u000a        statement was echoed by an Admissions Tutor who said, evaluating\u000a        participation in one of the 7 national workshops led by Holmstrom and\u000a        funded by the HEA to develop good admissions practice, `We now have an\u000a        effective balance between personal attributes and qualifications,\u000a        ensuring that those selected are the best qualified AND most able'\u000a        [C11].\u000a    \u000a    Law teaching nationally has been shaped by our research evidence\u000a      (conducted in partnership with the University of Bedfordshire, the\u000a      research reflects a distinct and material input from Sussex).\u000a    \u000a      \u000aInfluencing policy: Following the original research, Braye was\u000a        commissioned by HEA to conduct further research into the law field\u000a        curriculum\u000a        (see http:\/\/www.swap.ac.uk\/docs\/projects\/socialworklaw_rpt.pdf\u000a        ). This research was cited in the Law Commission's review of adult\u000a        social-care law as evidence of the need for legal reform (see http:\/\/lawcommission.justice.gov.uk\/docs\/\u000a          lc326_adult_social_care.pdf) and subsequently in the Department of\u000a        Health impact assessment relating to the Care Bill 2013 (see https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/\u000aattachment_data\/file\/197938\/Care_and_Support_Legal_Reform_IA__FINAL_.pdf,\u000a        para 6.12). Braye provided evidence to the SWTF working group on the law\u000a        curriculum, and commented on its proposals. Law is now more thoroughly\u000a        woven within the HCPC and TCSW requirements, and the national law\u000a        curriculum reflects Sussex input to the TCSW Law Curriculum Guide\u000a        to accompany the Professional Capability Framework [C5].\u000a      \u000aInfluencing HE practice: Law learning has improved as a result\u000a        of Law e-learning resources produced by the Department. The resources\u000a        [C6] were commissioned by SCIE on behalf of the Department of Health,\u000a        and were based on the evidence from the underpinning SCIE study [R2].\u000a        The resources were awarded first prize for innovation by the HEA\u000a        Association of Learning Technology. Subsequent SCIE-commissioned\u000a        outcome-focused research [R3] led to the Collaborative Capacity Building\u000a        Learning Set research, with educators and students focusing specifically\u000a        on the impact of the e-learning resources. They identified the factors\u000a        that enhance tutor engagement with their use, the positive impact on\u000a        student knowledge and confidence, and the pedagogic practices that\u000a        enhance learning. Participants attest to the transformative change in\u000a        education practice, as exemplified by this quote from an educator: `I've\u000a        gone into (the learning set) meetings feeling bludgeoned by higher\u000a        education and my workload (and have emerged) feeling empowered to come\u000a        back and make changes. ... In terms of professional identity, I went\u000a        from being somebody who was new to having some credibility and\u000a        professional confidence with colleagues; I felt really of value because\u000a        I was part of it ... I've got some kind of identity within my profession\u000a        and teaching' [C11].\u000a    \u000a    National teaching of communication skills with children has been\u000a          shaped by our research evidence, and communications with children have\u000a          improved\u000a    \u000a      \u000aInfluencing policy: In 2013, the Care Council for Wales (CCW)\u000a        reported that they have used the 3 studies commissioned from the Sussex\u000a        team to improve practice with children in Wales in the following ways:\u000a        (i) to revise the National Occupational Standards for Social Work upon\u000a        which the Wales socialwork degree is based; (ii) to inform the CCW\u000a        review of requirements for approval of the degree and increase the\u000a        requirements in relation to safeguarding; (iii) to develop, consult on\u000a        and begin to implement a framework for Continuing Professional Education\u000a        and Learning for social workers in Wales, which forms a nationallyagreed\u000a        career pathway for social workers; (iv) to inform CCW quality assurance\u000a        of socialwork degree programmes; (v) to inform the preparation of\u000a        child-developmentannotated bibliographies as a resource for educators\u000a        and practitioners [C7]. In England, Luckock raised awareness of the SCIE\u000a        research findings [R1] in his submission to the House of Commons'\u000a        Children, Schools and Families Enquiry into the Training of Children and\u000a        Families Social Workers (Para. 14, Seventh Report of Session 2008-09,\u000a        Volume 1).\u000a      \u000aInfluencing HE practice: The research led to social workers\u000a        feeling better prepared for work with children. Research was used in two\u000a        books on good practice with children: (i) BAAF identified Luckock and\u000a        Lefevre's book [R4] as `a core text ...widely used to train social\u000a        workers and other professionals' [C8]; (ii) Policy Press records (2013)\u000a        show that Lefevre's book [R5] was adopted by 31 BA and MA SWE teachers\u000a        in 29 HEIs in England and Wales who were teaching 1,529 students a year\u000a        [C9]. Lefevre was consulted on development of The College `Curriculum\u000a          Guide on Communication Skills', where her 2010 book is cited as a\u000a        core text [C10]. The HEA continue to support development of the impact\u000a        of Lefevre's research. In 2013 they awarded a teaching development grant\u000a        to Lefevre to develop and evaluate the learning and assessment of\u000a        communication and engagement with children and young people in\u000a        final-year social work placements.\u000a      \u000aInfluencing social work practice: Nationally Lefevre receives\u000a        more invitations from social-work and non-social-work children's\u000a        agencies to contribute to training their staff than she can accommodate.\u000a        In 2013, this included an invitation from the British Association of\u000a        Osteopaths. In 2011-12 and 2012-13, the Children and Family Court\u000a        Advisory Service commissioned Lefevre to train their practitioners in\u000a        London. This training draws directly on her researcher-practitioner\u000a        perspective and leads to improved communication with children by\u000a        practitioners. Practitioners commented on the effect of the\u000a        training: `I hope and I believe that I have developed some kind of\u000a        attunement, becoming a bit more alert to what children tell me and\u000a        finding\/developing creative ways in establishing communication with\u000a        them'; `It has encouraged me to listen to children on how they\u000a        communicate in implicit ways that I failed to pick up previously' [C11].\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In a period of national questioning of social work quality, Sussex\u000a      research has significantly influenced the curricula content of and entry\u000a      standards for social work education (SWE).

Funded research into\u000a      SWE took a significant step forward in 2006, when Sussex was selected\u000a      (from 300 applicants) as a Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE)\u000a      Registered Provider of Research. Sussex staff were commissioned to\u000a      undertake ten studies of teaching, learning and assessment in Department\u000a      of Health required curricula. Our research contributed to the knowledge\u000a      base for implementation of the new social work degree (introduced in\u000a      2003-04) and was methodologically innovative &#8212; including participation by\u000a      users in its research design and implementation &#8212; and was the first to\u000a      apply systematic review methodology to SWE.\u000a    Two SCIE studies, Teaching, Learning and Assessing of Communication\u000a        Skills with Children and Young People in Social Work Education and Teaching,\u000a        Learning and Assessment of Law in Social Work Education, selected\u000a      here for their significance to the changing policy and practice context,\u000a      were informed by systematic reviews, surveys of university practices and\u000a      consultation workshops with service-users, including children and young\u000a      people. We found that the teaching and assessment of communication skills\u000a      with children was inconsistent, with diverging views on its importance\u000a      [see Section 3, R1], and that the law-social work relationship was often\u000a      strained &#8212; students found law learning difficult and curricula were\u000a      diverse [R2]. Both SCIE studies led to further commissions to extend the\u000a      reach of the initial research. Following a commission (2007) to develop\u000a      innovative e-learning tools to enhance law-learning, Braye and colleagues\u000a      undertook a further SCIE study (2011) using 283 matched student pairs\u000a      across 8 institutions to explore educator capacity to use e-learning\u000a      resources, and their impact on student learning [R3]. Luckock and Lefevre\u000a      were commissioned to develop 2 core practice texts translating the SCIE\u000a      findings [R1] for HE educators, students and practitioners: (i) in 2008,\u000a      the British Association of Adoption and Fostering commissioned them to\u000a      address direct practice with children (2008) [R4]; ii) in 2010, Policy\u000a      Press commissioned Lefevre to write Communicating with Children and\u000a        Young People [R5]. In 2009, following a presentation by Lefevre at\u000a      the UK Joint Social Work Education Conference, the Care Council for Wales\u000a      invited Lefevre and Taylor to undertake 3 linked studies to inform SWE and\u000a      practice with children in Wales. Overall, in addition to 5 SCIE\u000a      publications, these studies generated 10 peer-refereed journal articles, 8\u000a      national conference presentations (6 by invitation) and 9 international (4\u000a      by invitation).\u000a    In 2008, following a child-abuse death, perceptions escalated of a\u000a      failure to select `suitable' social work students and\/or produce high\u000a      quality graduates. Stakeholders voiced concerns to The House of Commons'\u000a      Children, Schools and Families Select Committee investigating the training\u000a      of children and families social workers (2008-09), the Social Work Task\u000a      Force (SWTF) (2008) and the Social Work Reform Board (SWRB) (2010). In\u000a      response to changing policy, we pro-actively engaged with new bodies\u000a      mandated to raise the standards of SWE: The College of Social Work and the\u000a      Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) &#8212; which replaced the General\u000a      Social Care Council (GSCC). In 2008, the first UK exploratory study of its\u000a      kind examined the relationship between applicants' pre-admission\u000a      information and their performance on a social-work programme [R6].This led\u000a      the Higher Education Academy (HEA) to commission Holmstrom to research\u000a      student selection in social work, and to inform development of admissions\u000a      policy in England [R7].

However, a review undertaken for ECR Europe Shrinkage\u000a      Group (an influential\u000a      joint trade and industry body which Beck has been the academic advisor to\u000a      since 1999) by\u000a      academics from Cranfield University estimated that for those organisations\u000a      adopting the Loss\u000a      Prevention Road Map (9 companies responded to the survey) they estimated\u000a      they had saved\u000a      &#8364;620,574,000 in one year through using the approaches developed by Beck\u000a      (with Chapman and\u000a      Peacock) as part of the ECR Europe Shrinkage Group (2010).\u000a    More recently (2012), a representative from the Australian retailer\u000a      Coles, announced that by using\u000a      the approach developed by Beck and the ECR Europe Shrinkage Group, they\u000a      had achieved an\u000a      annual saving of Aus$100 million, with an expectation that a further\u000a      Aus$100 million would be\u000a      saved in each of the following two years. More broadly, in 2010 then\u000a      Chairman of Tesco, Sir Terry\u000a      Leahy and Co-Chair of ECR Europe, said of the work of the ECR Europe\u000a      Shrinkage Group: `in the\u000a      hands of consultants this would be worth millions'.\u000a    Through working closely with a wide range of companies and representative\u000a      bodies, undertaking\u000a      extensive dissemination work through producing practitioner publications\u000a      and organising and\u000a      presenting workshops and seminars, Beck's research findings have been\u000a      widely adopted across\u000a      the world. They have made a significant difference to the way in which\u000a      organisations not only think\u000a      about the problems they face but also how they go about developing more\u000a      effective and\u000a      sustainable strategies to improve their business performance.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Globally, the impact of loss of goods within organisations is highly\u000a      significant in economic terms,\u000a      with estimates suggesting the retail sector alone loses approximately $232\u000a      billion a year. This can\u000a      take the form of internal and external theft, inter-company fraud and a\u000a      whole range of process-related\u000a      losses. Traditional approaches have typically focused on responding to the\u000a      symptoms of\u000a      these losses through the adoption of a range of short-term technological\u000a      fixes such as product tags\u000a      and CCTV.\u000a    The research undertaken by Beck has focused on helping organisations to\u000a      better understand the\u000a      root causes of these losses, which can be found in a range of operational\u000a      failures embedded within\u000a      business practices. His work has provided retail organisations across the\u000a      globe with new insights,\u000a      tools and techniques to more effectively measure, monitor and control the\u000a      problem of loss, which\u000a      has enabled them to make multi-billion pound savings.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Leicester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Leicester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Leicester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10007796}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"993800","Name":"Joburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"},{"GeoNamesId":"3871336","Name":"Santiago"},{"GeoNamesId":"2147714","Name":"Sydney"},{"GeoNamesId":"4560349","Name":"Philadelphia"},{"GeoNamesId":"993800","Name":"Johannesburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin"},{"GeoNamesId":"3448439","Name":"Sao Paulo"},{"GeoNamesId":"3128760","Name":"Barcelona"},{"GeoNamesId":"3448439","Name":"San Paulo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2158177","Name":"Melbourne"},{"GeoNamesId":"4684888","Name":"Dallas"},{"GeoNamesId":"3448439","Name":"Sao Paolo"},{"GeoNamesId":"3451190","Name":"Rio de Janeiro"},{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin City"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1) Beck, A. with Peacock, C.

However, many of these solutions have a\u000a      short-lived impact, with\u000a      offenders quickly finding ways to defeat any intervention.\u000a    The research by Beck has focused on helping organisations through a\u000a      critical review of how the\u000a      problem is conceptualised, to put the problem of theft into a broader loss\u000a      context, where typically\u000a      non-theft losses, such as damage and error, could account for as much as\u000a      70% of the problem (1).\u000a      His work has drawn attention to the key role operational failures play in\u000a      either directly generating\u000a      loss or creating the opportunities for thieves to steal. His findings have\u000a      pointed to the need to\u000a      identify and ameliorate the root causes of the problem rather than\u000a      continuing to react to the\u000a      symptoms, e.g. eliminating crime-encouraging business processes rather\u000a      than trying to catch more\u000a      thieves. In addition, his work has helped businesses to begin to redefine\u000a      the role of those\u000a      responsible for dealing with loss, moving them away from being pseudo\u000a      police officers focused on\u000a      catching criminals, towards being business partners operating as `agents\u000a      of change', interested in\u000a      developing cross functional collaborative solutions that are hard wired\u000a      into business operations that\u000a      ultimately deter offending and minimise non theft losses (1).\u000a    Working with a range of case study companies in both Europe and the US,\u000a      Beck's research has\u000a      identified not only the way in which operational failures can and do occur\u000a      across the entire retailing\u000a      sector (such as the initial design of the product, how it is moved across\u000a      supply chains and the way\u000a      in which it is displayed and sold within stores) but also how they can be\u000a      identified and\u000a      subsequently rectified (6, 5). This involved the development (with Chapman\u000a      and Peacock) of the\u000a      ECR Europe Loss Prevention Road Map - a structured business tool using\u000a      techniques such as\u000a      Process Mapping and Failure Mode Effect Analysis to help organisations\u000a      identify operational\u000a      failures and create suitable and sustainable solutions (1).\u000a    In addition, case-study research with US retailers (2007) enabled Beck to\u000a      develop a model\u000a      describing the key elements organisations need to develop to deliver\u000a      effective and sustainable loss\u000a      prevention &#8212; The Loss Prevention Pyramid (1, 6). Focused on three key\u000a      areas: Strategic,\u000a      Organisational and Operational factors, the Loss Prevention Pyramid\u000a      provides organisations with a\u000a      framework of 11 key elements that are required to deliver effective loss\u000a      prevention. This work has\u000a      been brought together (2009, with Peacock) under the overarching theme of\u000a      New Loss Prevention,\u000a      which gives organisations both the broad theoretical framework within\u000a      which to understand why\u000a      and how loss occurs within retailing, but also the tools and techniques to\u000a      identify operational\u000a      failures and develop appropriate and sustainable solutions (1). More\u000a      recently, the addition of the\u000a      Loss Prevention Benchmarking Tool enables organisations to track their\u000a      performance against an\u000a      industry-wide standard as well as periodic changes within their own\u000a      organisation: http:\/\/www.ecr-shrink-group.com\/benchmarking-tool.\u000a    This work is on-going as new processes and operations develop within\u000a      retailing such as self-scan\u000a      and mobile checkouts, which present new opportunities and risks for loss\u000a      to occur. Beck's work\u000a      (2011) has looked at how these new technologies can change offending\u000a      behaviour and how\u000a      organisations can redesign business practices to respond to these new and\u000a      evolving risks (2).\u000a      More recently, he has been working with Durex to help them redesign their\u000a      packaging to increase\u000a      the deterrent impact of security signage on products most likely to be\u000a      stolen in retail stores.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41449","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    We demonstrate impact from the two areas of research outlined above:\u000a      Policy and Practice interventions; and research with `hard to reach' young\u000a      people.\u000a    Policy and practice:\u000a    Our body of research into CSE informed the 2000 and 2009 Government\u000a      guidance noting that children selling sex were victims of abuse, and\u000a      promoting multi-agency work to link child protection and law enforcement\u000a      strategies to protect children [5.1].

This definition was subsequently adopted by the\u000a      Association of Chief Police Officers, the Metropolitan Police Service and\u000a      the government's national gang strategy, published in 2011 as `Ending\u000a        Gang and Youth Violence,' in which his work is cited 5 times\u000a      advocating the need for multi-agency responses to gang violence [5.7]. His\u000a      research also had an impact in the area of child and adolescent\u000a      safeguarding, and the London Children Safeguarding Board report (2009), Safeguarding\u000a        Children Affected by Gang Activity and\/or Serious Youth Violence,\u000a      cites his work 15 times. As rapporteur, Pitts advised the Prime Minister's\u000a      International Gangs Forum (Oct 2011) including William Bratton, the\u000a      high-profile American police chief. Forum participants included\u000a      representatives from police departments and social welfare agencies from\u000a      all over Europe and North America. Pitts is now a member of the expert\u000a      advisory group steering the UK national strategy `Preventing Gang\u000a      Violence'.\u000a    Finally, recognising the impact of our work, new developments arising\u000a      include:\u000a    \u000a      Working with Oxford University on a new ESRC seminar series titled\u000a        `Fostering teenagers: challenges, theories and research'.\u000a      Developing the evaluation of new Child Sexual Exploitation Services\u000a        funded through the CSE Funders Alliance, for whom Pearce acts as\u000a        coordinator. Pearce is managing the collaboration of over 23 major\u000a        trusts and funders who are promoting practice-based interventions to\u000a        prevent child sexual exploitation by funding 16 new CSE services from\u000a        2012-2015.\u000a    \u000a    Research with hard to reach young people\u000a    Through externally funded participatory action research we have directly\u000a      engaged with over 800 marginalised and sexually exploited young people\u000a      from the UK. This work has impacted on the confidence and self esteem of\u000a      the young people involved and has resulted in wider distribution of\u000a      child-appropriate messages, given in young people's voices about the\u000a      meaning and impact of sexual exploitation. The work is distinctive as it\u000a      provides opportunity for exploited young people's voices to be heard. For\u000a      example, four young people spoke at a Council of Europe conference in Rome\u000a      (2010) and two young people were selected from 8 volunteers to speak at a\u000a      Eurochild European conference of over 300 European policy leaders in Milan\u000a      (2013). The work brings young people's own research agendas to the fore.\u000a      For example, we have, with our partner agencies, trained and supported\u000a      young people affected by child sexual exploitation to work with the `What\u000a      Works For Us' (WWFU) group. They produced a WWFU Annual Report listing\u000a      topics that need research in the future [5.8]. This was distributed to 144\u000a      LSCBs and specialist CSE services. The report documents their activities,\u000a      including advising mass media coverage of CSE through the BBC East Enders\u000a      CSE story line; directing the Police `Child Sexual Exploitation On Line\u000a      Protection Service' (CEOP) in youth sensitive policing; and advising The\u000a      Office of the Children's Commissioner for England OCC on the dissemination\u000a      of youth appropriate materials from their Inquiry into CSE in gangs and\u000a      groups, with the OCC recognising the impact of the University's work in\u000a      this field on their developing policy [5.9].\u000a    In our research with and for hard to reach young people we have\u000a      co-produced creative writing project outputs. To create these outputs,\u000a      young people identify a problem; engage with other young people through\u000a      one-to-one interviews\/ focus groups or workshop activities and document\u000a      findings in youth-friendly materials. This impacts on improving the self\u000a      esteem of the young people concerned and on the reach of dissemination to\u000a      other young people and those who work with them. This has included\u000a    \u000a      Working with 53 sexually exploited young people to produce two\u000a        booklets that explain the impact of abuse caused through CSE (see www.beds.ac.uk\/iasr\/centres\/intcent).\u000a        These booklets have been accessed by 46 specialist CSE projects with a\u000a        reach to over 2,000 young people with whom they work. CSE funders\u000a        have also been influenced by viewing these materials: The CSE Funder's\u000a        Alliance has recognised the impact of participatory research activities\u000a        on both the young people participating and those who access the outputs.\u000a        The funder's alliance has, in recognition of this, opened requests for\u000a        funding for further peer research projects with the intention of\u000a        producing more similar outputs.\u000a      Working with The Association of Young People's Health (AYPH) to engage\u000a        with 10 young people under the `be healthy' project. The young people\u000a        have produced a booklet and CD film about their use of support services\u000a        [5.10]. This was launched to an audience of 56 young people and is\u000a        widely disseminated to child health agencies and child sexual\u000a        exploitation services. Its relevance to young people is demonstrated\u000a        through calls for reprinting of a further 3,000 copies of the booklet\u000a        with CD for distribution to CSE projects across England and through\u000a        Eurochild and The Council of Europe.\u000a      Reaching and engaging with 35 young people affected by sexual violence\u000a        to produce a high quality film which, prior to final production, has\u000a        already reached 55 gang-affected young people. Following media training,\u000a        12 of these young people represented the group at the report launch at\u000a        The UK Government `Speaker's House' to an audience of Government\u000a        ministers, MPs and key policy makers.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Child protection policy and practice has largely ignored young people's\u000a      experiences of child sexual exploitation (CSE) and peer-on-peer violence.\u000a      Law enforcement and child protection responses are not integrated,\u000a      resulting in oversimplified interpretations of young people's victimhood\u000a      and criminality.

Our work is unique in that it reaches out\u000a      to and engages with young people affected by CSE and sexual violence as\u000a      actors in creating change through research and related activities. We have\u000a      undertaken 36 externally funded projects and attracted &#163;1.56 million since\u000a      2008 for research within two interrelated impact areas; `Policy and\u000a      practice' and `research with `hard to reach' young people'.\u000a    Policy and practice:\u000a    Sexually exploited young people had historically been criminalized for\u000a      prostitution offences. Our research of women's retrospective accounts of\u000a      entering prostitution revealed that they were victims of child abuse\u000a      rather than `willful villains' and our evaluation of three exit programmes\u000a      for young people abused through prostitution found that multi-agency\u000a      strategies matching interventions to risk levels facilitated exit most\u000a      effectively [3.1]. In this and other research, we found that poverty was a\u000a      significant causal factor for children becoming victims of CSE [3.2].\u000a      Further work demonstrated that over a quarter of 55 victims of child\u000a      sexual exploitation (CSE) faced multiple problems, including\u000a      criminalization for behaviour resulting from abuse [3.3], Subsequently:\u000a    \u000a      Our interviews with 48 young offending gang members in the UK [3.4]\u000a        and ongoing findings (2011-13) from 188 young people affected by sexual\u000a        exploitation and sexual violence in gang-affected neighbourhoods in the\u000a        UK, evidenced the damaging relationship between social deprivation,\u000a        violence and abuse, finding that sexual violence and exploitation is\u000a        integral to gang crime. This is unique as it brings law enforcement and\u000a        child protection strategies together with young people to address\u000a        gender-based sexual violence.\u000a      Our review of 144 local safeguarding children boards' (LSCB) responses\u000a        to CSE [3.5] revealed that less than a quarter integrated child\u000a        protection and law enforcement responses and only 10% were effective in\u000a        safeguarding exploited children.\u000a      Our research with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty\u000a        to Children (NSPCC) on practitioners' responses to trafficked young\u000a        people revealed a `culture of disbelief' where child protection concerns\u000a        were overlooked and children criminalized for actions resulting from\u000a        exploitation [3.6].\u000a      At a European level, our review of European initiatives to engage\u000a        children in stopping sexual violence in 43 countries found that only 5%\u000a        of the countries had active policies engaging children to prevent sexual\u000a        violence. The `Our Voices project' (2012 ongoing) is targeting research\u000a        with 6 European countries to share methods of engaging children in work\u000a        to prevent sexual violence they experience.\u000a    \u000a    Research with `hard to reach' Young People:\u000a    Our innovative participatory methods have involved over 800 `hard to\u000a      reach' young people in England representing their voices through art work,\u000a      film and booklet productions. We have trained and supported them as\u000a      advisors on research teams, media outputs and policy forums.

The reach of the\u000d\u000a      impacts on practitioner services -\u000d\u000a      and subsequently the benefits to patients - has also been significantly\u000d\u000a      enhanced by BMJ\u000d\u000a      Learning's inclusion in its online course for GPs working with\u000d\u000a      self-harming patients of a video\u000d\u000a      commissioned from Briggs in 2012. This video addresses key factors in\u000d\u000a      assessing risks of self-\u000d\u000a      harm, and emphasises the need to assess motivations in each case through\u000d\u000a      relating to the patient.\u000d\u000a      It is one of two videos on the site and the only one produced by an\u000d\u000a      academic. Feedback from 131\u000d\u000a      course participants showed that the video was well received: comments\u000d\u000a      included \"excellent\", \"very\u000d\u000a      informative\", and \"really thought provoking and useful\" [e].\u000d\u000a    Informing changes in policy and guidelines: Briggs' work was valued\u000d\u000a    highly by Maytree, who have\u000d\u000a    since made extensive use of his evaluation report: \"There is no doubt\", its\u000d\u000a    Director states, \"that the\u000d\u000a    report...assists us in securing funding, promotes our service to medical and\u000d\u000a    non-medical\u000d\u000a    practitioners, in building new partnerships with statutory and voluntary\u000d\u000a    sector services, and\u000d\u000a    reassures potential service users that our model is effective\" [f].\u000d\u000a    Maytree have used the\u000d\u000a    evaluations to support successful funding applications amounting to &#163;284,950\u000d\u000a    in the past 2 years\u000d\u000a    alone, a considerable sum for this small organisation; the research has also\u000d\u000a    supported the\u000d\u000a    development since 2012 of a partnership with the British Transport Police [f].\u000d\u000a    In 2008, Briggs'\u000d\u000a    invited presentation of the findings of his work with Maytree persuaded the\u000d\u000a    then-lead for NHS\u000d\u000a    mental Health, Louis Appleby, to accept the case for NHS support for\u000d\u000a    Maytree.\u000d\u000a    The research (particularly [6]) has also attracted interest from\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and practitioners in\u000d\u000a      Norway, and in 2012 Briggs advised suicide prevention specialists in\u000d\u000a      Australia on the replication of\u000d\u000a      the Maytree model. On the basis of his expertise in this field, Briggs was\u000d\u000a      also an invited member of\u000d\u000a      the National Clinical Institute for Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guideline\u000d\u000a      Development Group for `Self-\u000d\u000a      harm, longer term management (2009-11). He was subsequently invited to\u000d\u000a      contribute to panels\u000d\u000a      advising on commissioning (2012) and evidence update (2013). His\u000d\u000a      involvement influenced the\u000d\u000a      incorporation into the Guidelines of a paradigm-changing focus on the\u000d\u000a      centrality of relationship-led\u000d\u000a      approaches to working with self-harm, which is now being implemented\u000d\u000a      across the NHS [g].\u000d\u000a    (ii.)

Briggs' commissioned\u000d\u000a      work for the Trust for London\u000d\u000a      [8] included the provision of a supportive, consulting relational approach\u000d\u000a      for use by practitioners in\u000d\u000a      newly-founded, small African community organisations. Based on the\u000d\u000a      practice-near approach, this\u000d\u000a      facilitated the structural, strategic and operational development of\u000d\u000a      organisations including the\u000d\u000a      Victoria Climbie Foundation (VCF), Africans Unite Against Child Abuse\u000d\u000a      (AFRUCA), and Congolese\u000d\u000a      Family Centre. VCF found the evaluation findings \"helpful in developing\u000d\u000a      the VCF organisation, both\u000d\u000a      in terms of communicating our work around child abuse linked to witchcraft\u000d\u000a      and spirit possession to\u000d\u000a      safeguarding and other statutory professionals, and in raising child\u000d\u000a      protection awareness in the\u000d\u000a      communities with whom we work\" [h].\u000d\u000a    Informing changes in policy and guidelines. The findings of the\u000d\u000a      Trust for London evaluation were\u000d\u000a      shared widely with relevant professionals and government bodies through\u000d\u000a      contributions to policy\u000d\u000a      discussion and debate, helping to reduce the `wall of silence' around the\u000d\u000a      important social problems\u000d\u000a      addressed in the research. The evaluation outcomes were also announced at\u000d\u000a      a conference for 100\u000d\u000a      practitioners, chaired by Baroness Howarth on 13 May 2011. They were\u000d\u000a      shared with a further 170\u000d\u000a      practitioners via two conferences hosted by AFRUCA and the Tavistock in\u000d\u000a      October and November\u000d\u000a      2011: participants evaluated these as positively informing their\u000d\u000a      understanding of the complex\u000d\u000a      issues involved.\u000d\u000a    A 2012 National Action Plan produced by the Department for Education\u000d\u000a      Working Group to tackle\u000d\u000a      child abuse linked to faith or belief cited the Trust for London\u000d\u000a      evaluation report as providing \"critical\u000d\u000a      learning which should be taken into account in future projects or activity\u000d\u000a      by statutory and non-\u000d\u000a      statutory partners\" [i, p. 5]. It also repeated key findings of\u000d\u000a      that evaluation, including recognising:\u000d\u000a      \"the importance of engaging with faith leaders and of training to help\u000d\u000a      build understanding\" and that\u000d\u000a      \"broader engagement with communities is more effective than narrower\u000d\u000a      engagement on the issue\u000d\u000a      of witchcraft and spirit possession\" [i, p. 6]. A literature review\u000d\u000a      of evidence on child abuse linked to\u000d\u000a      faith or belief was commissioned from The Childhood Wellbeing Research\u000d\u000a      Centre in 2012 by the\u000d\u000a      Department for Education, in conjunction with the National Action Plan.\u000d\u000a      That review, which was\u000d\u000a      commissioned to help inform future policy in the area, likewise repeatedly\u000d\u000a      used key evaluation\u000d\u000a      findings to suggest future directions of travel in generating evidence in\u000d\u000a      this area [j]. In April 2012\u000d\u000a      Briggs was invited with another member of the UEL\/Tavistock research team,\u000d\u000a      Elaine Ryan, to\u000d\u000a      contribute specialist insights to a House of Commons summit sponsored by\u000d\u000a      Chuka Umunna MP\u000d\u000a      and AFRUCA on the abuse of children of African heritage linked to belief\u000d\u000a      in witchcraft or\u000d\u000a      possession. Briggs and Ryan drew, again, on the evaluation findings to\u000d\u000a      highlight the complex\u000d\u000a      relationships between beliefs and child protection, and to recommend\u000d\u000a      training professionals to use\u000d\u000a      the child protection framework for assessment of cases of suspected faith\u000d\u000a      abuse. This resulted in\u000d\u000a      the allocation from 2012 of funding to support AFRUCA's training of 100\u000d\u000a      `children's champions'.\u000d\u000a    Increasing public awareness: The findings of the evaluation report\u000d\u000a      were communicated to much\u000d\u000a      wider public and practitioner audiences through their coverage in popular\u000d\u000a      media and practitioner\u000d\u000a      outlets including The Times (14\/05\/2011: average daily circulation\u000d\u000a      of 475,250 in January 2011) and\u000d\u000a      Community Care (16\/052011: 300,000 online users). The evaluation\u000d\u000a      was widely cited again, both\u000d\u000a      in the traditional media and online, in coverage of the verdict in the\u000d\u000a      Kristy Bamu case in January\u000d\u000a      2012, and Briggs discussed issues raised by that case on Radio Five Live's\u000d\u000a      Victoria Derbyshire\u000d\u000a      Programme (02\/03\/2012: average audience of 6.3 million March 2012).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Clinical, observational and biographical research developed at UEL has\u000d\u000a      produced and supported\u000d\u000a      the novel application of a practice-near methodology adapted to evaluate\u000d\u000a      social work practice and\u000d\u000a      social problems.

The development of that model was given crucial\u000d\u000a      impetus by the ESRC\u000d\u000a      seminar series `Practitioner research and practice-near methods' (2006-9),\u000d\u000a      led by Stephen Briggs\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Social Work at UEL since 2006) in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Professor Lynn Froggett\u000d\u000a      (UCLAN). This series facilitated an exploration by 50 academics and\u000d\u000a      practitioners in the UK and\u000d\u000a      Europe of the application of biographical and observational methods in a\u000d\u000a      range of practice settings.\u000d\u000a      The outputs of that seminar series (for example [1]) defined the\u000d\u000a      criteria for practice-near research\u000d\u000a      and its applications; they were disseminated particularly through special\u000d\u000a      issues of the Journal of\u000d\u000a      Social Work Practice published in 2009 and 2010, edited by Briggs and\u000d\u000a      Froggett and including\u000d\u000a      articles by UEL researchers Cooper and Hingley-Jones.

The BNIM\u000d\u000a      was developed at UEL\u000d\u000a      as part of the EU-funded Social Strategies in Risk Societies project\u000d\u000a      (1996-99), jointly coordinated\u000d\u000a      by Prue Chamberlayne (Senior\/Principal Lecturer at UEL until 1999) and\u000d\u000a      Michael Rustin (Professor\u000d\u000a      of Sociology at UEL since 1970) [2]. A central principle of the\u000d\u000a      BNIM is the capacity to connect the\u000d\u000a      `micro' of an individual life experience - particularly in emotional and\u000d\u000a      relational contexts - to the\u000d\u000a      `macro' of social trends and experiences. UEL has a longstanding\u000d\u000a      collaborative relationship with\u000d\u000a      the Tavistock Clinic, which is renowned for its application of\u000d\u000a      psychoanalytic approaches to\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinary professional practice. The method of infant observation\u000d\u000a      is a specialism of this\u000d\u000a      approach; initially devised for training psychotherapists, its potential\u000d\u000a      application within research\u000d\u000a      was demonstrated by Rustin [3]. Through his doctoral research\u000d\u000a      (1990-1995) and subsequent book\u000d\u000a      (Growth and Risk in Infancy, London 1997), Briggs translated this\u000d\u000a      observational approach into a\u000d\u000a      practice-relevant research method through its application to `at risk'\u000d\u000a      infants. The observational\u000d\u000a      methodology is distinguished by the use of reflective seminar groups to\u000d\u000a      analyse connections\u000d\u000a      between observations, conceptualisations and the emotional experiences of\u000d\u000a      the observer. This\u000d\u000a      reflective process was incorporated into BNIM as a `panel' method of\u000d\u000a      analysis to facilitate rigorous\u000d\u000a      reflexive data analysis.\u000d\u000a    His subsequent application of both infant observation and\u000d\u000a      aspects of the BNIM approach to a\u000d\u000a      series of services assessments allowed Briggs to develop a coherent,\u000d\u000a      innovative approach to the\u000d\u000a      evaluation of social work practice. This began with evaluations of Maytree\u000d\u000a      (2006, 2012), a respite\u000d\u000a      centre for suicidal people [4, 5], in which he drew on his\u000d\u000a      existing research specialism in self-harm\u000d\u000a      and suicide [6, 7]. Practice-near aspects in the Maytree studies\u000d\u000a      included: a central role for\u000d\u000a      observation; in-depth biographical follow-up interviews for Maytree\u000d\u000a      residents; the application of the\u000d\u000a      panel method for data analysis; and a focus on participant and researcher\u000d\u000a      emotionality and\u000d\u000a      relationships in the research process. The Trust for London subsequently\u000d\u000a      commissioned Briggs for\u000d\u000a      a 2008-11 evaluation of a community-based initiative to effect changes in\u000d\u000a      attitudes among, and\u000d\u000a      reduce the abusive use of religious practices in, London's African\u000d\u000a      Communities. The practice-near\u000d\u000a      approach was applied here to generate rigorous research findings, using\u000d\u000a      aspects of the infant\u000d\u000a      observation model to study sensitive interactions between community\u000d\u000a      members and organisations\u000d\u000a      working to effect change. The evaluation demonstrated the relationship\u000d\u000a      between religious practices\u000d\u000a      and potential child abuse, and showed how social factors, including\u000d\u000a      poverty and marginalisation, in\u000d\u000a      these communities, increase the risks of abuse [8].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42370","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Process from research to impact:\u000d\u000a    Recognition of the Strathclyde research's conclusions in relation to the\u000d\u000a      complex issues of historical\u000d\u000a      abuse, its consequences in terms of physical, sexual, emotional abuse and\u000d\u000a      neglect, programme\u000d\u000a      abuse, and systems abuse, and the importance of applying the lessons\u000d\u000a      learnt to current policy and\u000d\u000a      practice in residential child care was a central component of the Shaw\u000d\u000a      Review in 2007. This\u000d\u000a      review, chaired by Tom Shaw, was set up by the Scottish Government with an\u000d\u000a      explicit remit to\u000d\u000a      examine historical abuse in residential child care, the systems of laws,\u000d\u000a      rules and regulations and\u000d\u000a      their implementation and compliance, and their connections with historical\u000d\u000a      abuse (1950-1995).\u000d\u000a    Kendrick's previous research findings on abuse of children in care &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      need for appropriate\u000d\u000a      selection of and training for residential care staff, the need to find\u000d\u000a      ways to communicate about\u000d\u000a      abuse for particularly vulnerable groups of children in residential care,\u000d\u000a      and the gaps in evidence in\u000d\u000a      relation to the monitoring and inspection of services in the past &#8212; led to\u000d\u000a      him being commissioned to\u000d\u000a      provide an expert review of the national and international literature on\u000d\u000a      historical abuse as part of\u000d\u000a      the Shaw Review (Source 1). As Shaw has indicated, the Strathclyde\u000d\u000a      research had a direct and\u000d\u000a      material impact on the review: \"The research and advice contributed\u000d\u000a        directly to the findings of the\u000d\u000a        Systemic Review and to the specific recommendations addressing: current\u000d\u000a        provision to inform the\u000d\u000a        welfare and safety of looked after and accommodated children; former\u000d\u000a        residents' needs; and,\u000d\u000a        records\" (Source 2). Shaw's recommendations led to a number of\u000d\u000a      significant developments in\u000d\u000a      policy, practice and legislation in Scotland.\u000d\u000a    Types of impact: The research carried out at Strathclyde which\u000d\u000a      informed the Shaw Review, and\u000d\u000a      subsequent research, have led to concrete actions and impacts both in\u000d\u000a      relation to interventions to\u000d\u000a      address the needs of adults who have experienced abuse as children in\u000d\u000a      residential care, and in\u000d\u000a      relation to current residential care services, ensuring that the lives of\u000d\u000a      those who have experienced\u000d\u000a      residential care are improved. Through the continuing involvement of the\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde researchers\u000d\u000a      in the process by which policy, practice and services have been developed\u000d\u000a      and improved, the\u000d\u000a      research has had both a direct and indirect impact on improvements in\u000d\u000a      residential child care and\u000d\u000a      the health and well-being of children and young people.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on public policy, law and services: The Shaw Review's\u000d\u000a      recommendations on current\u000d\u000a      residential care led to the establishment of the National Residential\u000d\u000a      Child Care Initiative (NRCCI)\u000d\u000a      (Source 3) led by SIRCC and underpinned by Strathclyde's research. This\u000d\u000a      led the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) to\u000d\u000a      identify five areas of\u000d\u000a      action: care planning; workforce; commissioning; improving learning\u000d\u000a      outcomes; and improving\u000d\u000a      health outcomes (Source 3). A specific impact of NRCCI was the decision by\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      to expand the role of SIRCC to cover all looked after children and to\u000d\u000a      develop a new Centre for\u000d\u000a      Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland (CELCIS). To take this\u000d\u000a      forward for all looked after\u000d\u000a      children, SIRCC was replaced by CELCIS. This new Centre is providing\u000d\u000a      greater awareness of child\u000d\u000a      protection and safeguarding children in care, enhanced training, and\u000d\u000a      collaborative working to\u000d\u000a      support those who care for looked after children.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on practitioners and professional services: One strand of\u000d\u000a      the NRCCI focused on the\u000d\u000a      residential workforce and this is one of the five areas of action.\u000d\u000a      Building on Strathclyde's research,\u000d\u000a      the workforce hub has developed an enhanced qualification for residential\u000d\u000a      workers and supervisors\u000d\u000a      and this is currently awaiting Scottish Government Ministerial approval.\u000d\u000a      CELCIS has also\u000d\u000a      developed up-to-date training materials and launched the We Can and\u000d\u000a        Must Do Better website for\u000d\u000a      everyone in Scotland concerned with improving the outcomes for looked\u000d\u000a      after children, care\u000d\u000a      leavers and their families (Source 4).\u000d\u000a    Health and welfare impacts: Following the Shaw Review, the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government piloted a\u000d\u000a      confidential committee to hear the experiences of adults who had\u000d\u000a      experienced abuse in care &#8212;\u000d\u000a      Time to be Heard Pilot Forum. Strathclyde researchers were involved\u000d\u000a      in the evaluation of the pilot\u000d\u000a      (Source 5) and in undertaking a scoping study for a National Confidential\u000d\u000a      Forum. Subsequently,\u000d\u000a      the proposals for the development of the National Confidential Forum were\u000d\u000a      contained within the\u000d\u000a      Victims and Witness (Scotland) Bill published in 2013 (Source 6). Broader\u000d\u000a      conclusions of the\u000d\u000a      research in relation to participation and voice have been addressed\u000d\u000a      through a Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Framework for Historic Abuse in Scotland developed by the Scottish Human\u000d\u000a      Rights Commission\u000d\u000a      (Source 7). This has been taken forward, with the involvement of CELCIS\u000d\u000a      and the Strathclyde\u000d\u000a      researchers, through an InterAction on Historic Child Abuse\u000d\u000a      (Source 8) which has brought together\u000d\u000a      all key stakeholders: agencies that had historically provided residential\u000d\u000a      or foster care of children,\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government, professionals currently involved in the care of\u000d\u000a      children, faith-based\u000d\u000a      organisations, academics, and, importantly, representatives of survivors\u000d\u000a      of historic abuse. An\u000d\u000a      Action Plan on Justice for Victims of Historic Abuse of Children in\u000d\u000a        Care has been circulated widely\u000d\u000a      to relevant organisations in Scotland, for consideration about future\u000d\u000a      commitments.\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance: Implementation of the Strathclyde research\u000d\u000a      has resulted in\u000d\u000a      improvements and safeguards not only for those children and young people\u000d\u000a      who are currently\u000d\u000a      being looked after in residential and foster care (approximately 7,000),\u000d\u000a      but also those in other\u000d\u000a      settings such as hospitals, boarding schools, school hostels (a further\u000d\u000a      5,000). The beneficiaries\u000d\u000a      also include those adults who experienced care as children, particularly\u000d\u000a      survivors\/victims of\u000d\u000a      historical abuse. The number of those who experienced care in the past is\u000d\u000a      unclear due to lack of\u000d\u000a      statistics and records, and identifying the number of survivors\/victims of\u000d\u000a      abuse is even more\u000d\u000a      problematic due to shame, stigma and lack of evidence. In carrying out a\u000d\u000a      scoping study for the\u000d\u000a      establishment of a National Confidential Forum, the Strathclyde\u000d\u000a      researchers estimated that since\u000d\u000a      1930 almost half a million children have been in care in Scotland, and\u000d\u000a      over 300,000 of these are\u000d\u000a      still alive today. International estimates for the level of historical\u000d\u000a      abuse of children in care ranges\u000d\u000a      from 3 per cent to 10 per cent.\u000d\u000a    The impact is also significant for professionals currently working in\u000d\u000a      care settings and in providing\u000d\u000a      services for those who continue to suffer the consequences of abuse\u000d\u000a      throughout their lives. The\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde researchers' work in this area is also currently being used in\u000d\u000a      developments in relation\u000d\u000a      to historical abuse in Finland and the Netherlands. The Professor of\u000d\u000a      Implementation in Youth Care\u000d\u000a      at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences notes that \"research by\u000d\u000a        Professor Andrew Kendrick\u000d\u000a        at the University of Strathclyde has had a direct impact on the\u000d\u000a        development of quality guidelines to\u000d\u000a        prevent for (sexual) child abuse in residential and foster care in The\u000d\u000a        Netherlands. The guidelines\u000d\u000a        were developed by the Dutch employers' organisation in Youth Care and\u000d\u000a        supervised by a special\u000d\u000a        committee of which I am a member\" (Source 9).

The stigma and silencing effects of asymmetric\u000d\u000a      power relationships\u000d\u000a      involved in the abuse of children in care mean that the historical\u000d\u000a      experiences of adults provide\u000d\u000a      valuable lessons for current policy and practice, in addition to\u000d\u000a      highlighting their own needs as\u000d\u000a      victims and survivors of abuse. The abuse of children in care is one of\u000d\u000a      the most sensitive issues in\u000d\u000a      child welfare policy and practice and has received increasing attention in\u000d\u000a      recent years, with\u000d\u000a      markedly varying responses by governments internationally. Theoretical and\u000d\u000a      empirical research at\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde led by Andrew Kendrick has made connections between historical\u000d\u000a      abuse and\u000d\u000a      contemporary debates. The Strathclyde team has identified the ways in\u000d\u000a      which research in this area\u000d\u000a      is challenged by the lack of clear and consistent definitions and the need\u000d\u000a      to reconstruct\u000d\u000a      experiences and details, often through accounts and reporting by former\u000d\u000a      residents. Kendrick and\u000d\u000a      his colleagues have applied this research to specific policy and practice\u000d\u000a      contexts in Scotland and\u000d\u000a      contributed to recent developments in interventions for adults who have\u000d\u000a      experienced abuse in care\u000d\u000a      as children, broader developments to improve child care services, and the\u000d\u000a      welfare and quality of\u000d\u000a      life of children and young people in care.\u000d\u000a    The research carried out by Kendrick and colleagues on abuse in care has\u000d\u000a      been a central,\u000d\u000a      evidential basis for earlier reviews and government-led inquiries on\u000d\u000a      policy and practice in\u000d\u000a      residential child care in Scotland (Skinner Review, 1992) and on\u000d\u000a      safeguarding children in care\u000d\u000a      (Kent Review, 1997). More recent research at the University of Strathclyde\u000d\u000a      has extended this to\u000d\u000a      include a significant focus on the historical abuse of children in care,\u000d\u000a      as well as contentious,\u000d\u000a      practice issues such as the physical restraint of children in residential\u000d\u000a      child care which have\u000d\u000a      important implications for the safeguarding and protection of children.\u000d\u000a    Key findings: The research at Strathclyde has drawn crucial\u000d\u000a      lessons from historical abuse that\u000d\u000a      have been taken forward in a programme of theoretical and empirical\u000d\u000a      research in order to better\u000d\u000a      safeguard children from abuse in residential care, now and in the future.\u000d\u000a      First, the silencing effect\u000d\u000a      of asymmetrical power relations has meant that those abused felt unable to\u000d\u000a      disclose abuse, and\u000d\u000a      systems to support children to speak about abuse were found to be lacking\u000d\u000a      or ineffective [1, 5].\u000d\u000a      The research has underlined the importance of listening both to adults who\u000d\u000a      have experienced\u000d\u000a      abuse as children in residential care [5], and to children currently in\u000d\u000a      residential care [1, 4] and\u000d\u000a      recommended the creation of mechanisms to enable both actual and potential\u000d\u000a      abuse to be\u000d\u000a      discussed (such as the provision of complaints systems and advocacy\u000d\u000a      services). Further, the\u000d\u000a      research has highlighted the importance of the relationships between\u000d\u000a      children\/young people and\u000d\u000a      staff members, even in the complex and ambivalent context of the physical\u000d\u000a      restraint of children in\u000d\u000a      care [3], and developed theory to better understand the way in which\u000d\u000a      children and young people\u000d\u000a      conceptualise their relationships with family and others, and its\u000d\u000a      importance to residential child care\u000d\u000a      [6]. This underlines the importance of such relationships in creating an\u000d\u000a      open and transparent\u000d\u000a      culture to better meet the needs of children and young people.\u000d\u000a    Underpinning such developments is the need for a residential child care\u000d\u000a      workforce of the highest\u000d\u000a      quality and which demands rigorous procedures in selection and assessment,\u000d\u000a      and on-going\u000d\u000a      training and support [1, 2]. The absence of rigorous selection and\u000d\u000a      assessment of residential child\u000d\u000a      care staff has meant that children and young people have not always been\u000d\u000a      adequately protected.\u000d\u000a      The research identified variability in the use of particular elements of\u000d\u000a      the recruitment process, and\u000d\u000a      recommended better practice and training in recruitment, including the\u000d\u000a      participation of children and\u000d\u000a      young people in the recruitment process. The low levels of professional\u000d\u000a      education and training of\u000d\u000a      residential child care workers have been contributory factors in the\u000d\u000a      negative experiences of\u000d\u000a      children in care [1, 2]. There has been an important need to raise the\u000d\u000a      professional status of the\u000d\u000a      residential child care workforce and an important aspect of this is better\u000d\u000a      training and raising the\u000d\u000a      level of qualifications of residential child care staff members [1, 6].\u000d\u000a    Key researchers: The research was conducted by A. Kendrick,\u000d\u000a      Professor of Residential Child\u000d\u000a      Care in the School of Applied Social Sciences, University of Strathclyde\u000d\u000a      from 1\/09\/01; and involved\u000d\u000a      staff of the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care (SIRCC), later\u000d\u000a      Centre for Excellence for\u000d\u000a      Looked After Children (CELCIS), L.

A broad-based\u000a      alliance of partners in Glasgow then worked explicitly to include those\u000a      with experiences of mental\u000a      health issues in the development of an arts festival. This consortium\u000a      involved the Scottish\u000a      Government, NHS Boards, the national anti-stigma campaign (`see me'),\u000a      national mental health\u000a      voluntary sector partners, arts organisations, local authorities, human\u000a      rights and equalities\u000a      agencies, academics, and community activists and groups. This broad-based\u000a      alliance of partners\u000a      adopted as their starting point, the Strathclyde research conclusions that\u000a      positive messages\u000a      through culture and art were likely to deepen reach into the BME\u000a      communities, to develop and fund\u000a      an arts festival focussed on mental health. The festival was designed to\u000a      promote positive attitudes\u000a      towards mental health, mental illness, support and recovery, and so\u000a      generate significant cultural\u000a      change amongst opinion through the insights and influences of the creative\u000a      arts. Evidence that the\u000a      research was significant can be seen in the fact that the Scottish\u000a      Government and NHS invited the\u000a      Strathclyde researchers to chair the group.\u000a    Type of impact: The formation of a national Arts Festival\u000a      has produced the following benefits\u000a    Annual cultural events:\u000a      The consortium created a month long annual festival (initially the Glasgow\u000a      Mental Health Arts\u000a      Festival but now Scotland wide) blending culture, contact and community\u000a      development in order to\u000a      engage and influence marginalised communities. The first was held in 2006,\u000a      and each year the\u000a      programme has led to the creation of 300 events each year using a range of\u000a      art forms such as film,\u000a      theatre, literature, visual arts, dance, and comedy (Source 1). In the\u000a      last five years since 2008, the\u000a      event has engaged over 40,000 people. It is one of the largest arts and\u000a      social justice festivals in\u000a      Europe (Source 2) supporting a network of 16 regional grassroots festival\u000a      groups covering all of\u000a      the major regions of the country, each having its own identity, structure\u000a      and purpose. With local\u000a      communities and mental health professionals organising events alongside\u000a      music, drama and\u000a      acting professionals, the Festival has involved high proportions of people\u000a      living in poorer areas,\u000a      minority ethnic groups and people with experience of mental health\u000a      problems. Lee Knifton acted as\u000a      Director of the Scottish Mental Health Festival in 2013.\u000a    The Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival approach has been\u000a      replicated by similar events\u000a      in Northern Ireland (Source 3) and in Ireland (Source 4). An organiser of\u000a      the Northern Ireland event\u000a      has stated \"The Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival has been the\u000a      inspiration and impetus\u000a      for a similar Festival for Northern Ireland. The Scottish Festival's\u000a      collaborative model of\u000a      organisation, emphasis on inclusion, and incorporation of research on\u000a      impact have provided the\u000a      template for Northern Ireland\" (Source 3).\u000a    Changing attitudes to mental illness: by challenging established\u000a      norms, improving social\u000a      welfare, contributing to campaigns for social change.\u000a    For example, at the North Lanarkshire festival in 2012, three community\u000a      forums (Motherwell;\u000a      Wishaw, Murdostoun and Fortissat; and Bellshill and District) pledged\u000a      their involvement in anti-stigma\u000a      action (Source 5), and enhanced cultural understanding of issues around\u000a      stigma and\u000a      mental health, for example increased positive attitudes to reduce stigma\u000a      amongst audiences\u000a      (Source 6). Referring to the Scottish Mental Health and Arts Festival,\u000a      Isobel McCarthy, Mental\u000a      Health and Wellbeing Development Officer for South Lanarkshire Council\u000a      said \"Working in\u000a      partnership with our colleagues in NHS Lanarkshire, North Lanarkshire\u000a      Council and a variety of\u000a      local services to support the Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film\u000a      Festival to create an exciting\u000a      calendar of events this October (2012) has been a real privilege. The\u000a      opportunities this has\u000a      created for local people to engage in activities that support good mental\u000a      health and wellbeing and\u000a      promote recovery makes all the efforts worthwhile.\" (Source 10)\u000a    Influence on local communities and organisations:\u000a      This influence included new partnerships with teachers to deliver mental\u000a      health awareness lessons\u000a      in schools, with mental health groups to deliver training in workplaces,\u000a      and with community groups\u000a      to deliver a community conversation programme with BME communities (Source\u000a      7). Mental health\u000a      arts festivals are being incorporated within cultural strategies in\u000a      Glasgow and Renfrewshire, with a\u000a      new planning group being established, `The Creative Forum', which includes\u000a      a number of local\u000a      partners (Source 8). This has been supported through the embedding of\u000a      mental health in local\u000a      socio-cultural contexts through the choice of local venues including pubs,\u000a      prisons, shopping\u000a      centres, shop windows, libraries and community centres. The festival\u000a      programme in 2012 was\u000a      extended to new regions and genres, achieved record attendances and media\u000a      coverage, increased\u000a      online engagement, and developed new partnerships and projects. (Source 9)\u000a      There were more\u000a      than 100 articles during the Festival period from publications including:\u000a      The Scotsman; The Herald;\u000a      The Edinburgh Evening News; The Daily Record; The Evening Times; The\u000a      Skinny; STV Local and\u000a      The List. There were also discussions on radio stations such as: BBC Radio\u000a      Scotland; BBC 6\u000a      Music; The Vile Arts Radio Hour; and Radio Awaz, as well as a number of\u000a      local radio stations.\u000a      (Source 9)\u000a    Impacts on strategy of NHS and charitable bodies: influencing\u000a      policy and practice leading to\u000a      improved take-up or use of services, and improved health and welfare\u000a      outcomes.\u000a      Health Boards including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Lanarkshire\u000a      (Source 10), and\u000a      NHS Lothian (Source 11) have built the festival into their health\u000a      improvement policies and\u000a      strategies.

The\u000a      Campaign Implementation\u000a      Manager for `see me' has stated that \"One of the key elements of this\u000a      success (of `see me') has\u000a      been the unwavering partnership working bringing together numerous\u000a      national and local\u000a      organisations as well as hundreds of dedicated individuals\" On the `see\u000a      me' website (Source 13) it\u000a      notes regarding the 2012 annual festival \"This year's Scottish Mental\u000a      Health Arts and Film Festival\u000a      (SMHAFF) was the sixth time that the Festival brought together thousands\u000a      of people to celebrate\u000a      and explore the meanings of mental health. 'see me' is proud to say that\u000a      we are one of the\u000a      founding partners of SMHAFF and have been one of its main funders from the\u000a      beginning.\"\u000a    The overall impact of the research into the prevalence of stigma and\u000a      discrimination around mental\u000a      health within traditionally hard to reach communities has led to an annual\u000a      programme of cultural\u000a      events, which is now emulated in other parts of the United Kingdom, and\u000a      forms part of wider\u000a      government and NHS strategies to promote positive attitudes to mental\u000a      health.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted at Strathclyde has shown that current pathways which\u000a      focus on education\u000a      and public information are failing to transform attitudes to mental health\u000a      amongst low-income\u000a      communities and black &amp; ethnic minorities. Drawing on this research,\u000a      an annual Mental Health Arts\u000a      Festival has been created.

The research also\u000a      revealed the limited impact of current Government interventions within the\u000a      groups in changing\u000a      attitudes and behaviour. It was concluded that there was a risk that the\u000a      Scottish Government's\u000a      national programme and that of other European governments was worsening\u000a      major pre-existing\u000a      health inequalities within low income and BME communities.\u000a    In concluding that anti-stigma programmes were failing to bring about\u000a      transformative change in\u000a      low-income or BME communities, the research found that: there was\u000a      inadequate investment in\u000a      creating effective partnerships between the communities and professionals,\u000a      and consequently was\u000a      reinforcing exclusion [1,2]; many of the approaches adopted in practice in\u000a      campaigns were socially\u000a      and culturally inappropriate to enable information to reach all\u000a      communities [3,4]; and in particular,\u000a      that the focus on health and education, and the associated negative\u000a      portrayal of mental ill-health\u000a      [4,5] were key elements contributing to the disengagement of these\u000a      communities.\u000a    The Strathclyde research indicated that to achieve a greater impact on,\u000a      and reach into, BME and\u000a      low-income communities alternative forms of engagement were desirable,\u000a      replacing the current\u000a      approach of providing information in writing or through adverts. Drawing\u000a      on experiences in other\u000a      contexts, it proposed the use of festivals and different art forms (such\u000a      as narratives and cultural\u000a      engagement) to explore mental illness and empower marginalised\u000a      communities. Arts festivals, the\u000a      research concluded, have the advantage of generating positive contact\u000a      between marginalised\u000a      groups and the wider population in relation to mental health, placing\u000a      mental health issues within\u000a      different socio-cultural contexts, and increasing knowledge of mental\u000a      health issues. It also\u000a      indicated that the process of co-production associated with such festivals\u000a      encouraged dialogue,\u000a      involved a wider range of communities and organisations, and reduced the\u000a      risk of stigma and\u000a      marginalisation when those with mental health issues and experiences were\u000a      active participants.\u000a    Key researchers at University of Strathclyde\u000a      The research was conducted by Neil Quinn, Senior Lecturer in Social Work\u000a      (2004 to present) and\u000a      Lee Knifton, researcher at Mental Health Foundation and then from 2011\u000a      onwards, Senior\u000a      Research Fellow at Strathclyde.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42372","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Process from research to impact:\u000d\u000a      The Scottish Executive's Race Equality Scheme (RES) 2005 `Working Together\u000d\u000a      for Race Equality' commented that, at that time, not all Gypsy\/Traveller\u000d\u000a      communities were recognised for the purposes of the race relations\u000d\u000a      legislation but acknowledged the need for protection from discrimination\u000d\u000a      and abuse. Plans for services for the traveller community in Scotland\u000d\u000a      prior to 2008 were dealt with under the Equal Opportunities agenda.\u000d\u000a    In September 2008, an industrial tribunal case was brought in Aberdeen by\u000d\u000a      Mr Ken MacLennan claiming that his employers at the Gipsy Traveller\u000d\u000a      Education and Information Project (GTEIP) had dismissed him for \"taking a\u000d\u000a      stance on behalf of gipsy travellers\". Dr Clark was called as an expert\u000d\u000a      witness on behalf of the plaintiff, appearing before Judge Nicol Hosie and\u000d\u000a      others to argue the case for Scottish Gypsy\/Travellers having legal\u000d\u000a      protection under the terms of the Race Relations Act of 1976 (as amended\u000d\u000a      2000).\u000d\u000a    Over a two day period (8th- 9th September), Clark\u000d\u000a      presented as evidence his research findings from the 2006 study [5] and he\u000d\u000a      was questioned by both the plaintiff's and defendant's legal teams as well\u000d\u000a      as the Judge himself. At the heart of this case was a question over the\u000d\u000a      legal ethnicity and standing of Scottish Gypsy\/Travellers in regard to\u000d\u000a      Race Relations legislation. Using his prior research, Clark indicated that\u000d\u000a      in the absence of a `protected' socio-legal status of Scottish\u000d\u000a      Gypsy\/Traveller ethnicity, this group would, if they were to experience\u000d\u000a      social and cultural stigmatisation and discrimination, struggle to have\u000d\u000a      the same legal redress that other ethnic minority groups had in Scotland.\u000d\u000a      This hearing thus became the pivotal `test case' that Clark (2006) had\u000d\u000a      argued was required to provide legal clarification [5].\u000d\u000a    The judgement was in favour of the plaintiff, Mr MacLennan, with Judge\u000d\u000a      Hosie concluding: \"Having satisfied ourselves, therefore, that the two\u000d\u000a        main characteristics set out by Lord Fraser in Mandla were satisfied and\u000d\u000a        that the other non-essential characteristics were satisfied in varying\u000d\u000a        degrees, we arrived at the view that Scottish Gypsy-Travellers have\u000d\u000a        \"ethnic origins\", with reference in particular, to Section 3(1) of the\u000d\u000a        1976 Act and that they therefore enjoy the protection of the Act\" (page\u000d\u000a        15, point 49). Judge Hosie referred to Dr Clark's evidence\u000d\u000a      throughout his judgement and determined him to be an \"impressive and\u000d\u000a      persuasive witness\" (page 6, point 14).\u000d\u000a      The unanimous judgment of the Tribunal is summed up in the conclusion on\u000d\u000a      page 15 of the written judgment (dated 21 October, 2008). This judgment is\u000d\u000a      all the more remarkable as the Judge admits a previous mistake he had made\u000d\u000a      at an earlier industrial tribunal hearing in March 2008 which was\u000d\u000a      conducted without consulting the available evidence base or asking for\u000d\u000a      expert witness testimony: \"I think it is worthy of comment that,\u000d\u000a        having now approached the issue in this manner, I was convinced that I\u000d\u000a        had fallen into error by conducting the previous hearing in the way I\u000d\u000a        did and not hearing evidence. I am satisfied that my decision to review\u000d\u000a        that judgment, at my own instance, and to hear evidence, was the correct\u000d\u000a        one.\"\u000d\u000a    Types of Impactm\u000d\u000a    1. Changes in public policy and law\u000d\u000a      Following entry of the judgment into the Registry on 21 October 2008, the\u000d\u000a      test case had immediate and far-reaching impacts for all 20,000 to 22,000\u000d\u000a      Gypsy\/Travellers in Scotland - in terms of their legal protection, support\u000d\u000a      of future legal challenges, influence on public policy and in the\u000d\u000a      approaches taken by service providers to Gypsy\/Travellers (Sources 1 and\u000d\u000a      2). Further, as legal precedence, the judgment has in subsequent cases\u000d\u000a      been used to support Gypsy\/Travellers in challenging decisions which\u000d\u000a      affect their everyday lives and their identity. The research in Clark\u000d\u000a      (2006) [5] continues to be used by Scottish Gypsy\/Traveller individuals\u000d\u000a      and families to challenge discrimination in courts of laws.\u000d\u000a    The judgment officially granted legal protection as an ethnic minority\u000d\u000a      group to rights enshrined with all Race Relations legislation (now\u000d\u000a      superseded by the Equality Act 2010). Amnesty Scotland in their report `On\u000d\u000a      the Margins - Local authority service provision for Scottish Gypsy\u000d\u000a      Travellers' April 2012, has noted that this has provided security of\u000d\u000a      protection for the entire Gypsy\/Travellers community and impacted on their\u000d\u000a      confidence and ability to engage with local authorities and other\u000d\u000a      communities (Source 2).\u000d\u000a    The Equal Opportunities Committee, Scottish Parliament 1st\u000d\u000a      Report March 2013 (Source 5) acknowledges \"A recent Tribunal judgement (Mr\u000d\u000a      K MacLennan v Gypsy Traveller Education and Information Project 2009) held\u000d\u000a      that Gypsy Travellers are a distinct ethnic group and therefore covered by\u000d\u000a      the Race Relations Act 1976.\"\u000d\u000a    2. Improved social welfare and inclusion\u000d\u000a      The outcome of the judgement has impact on enhancement to policy and\u000d\u000a      practice, improved social welfare, inclusion and access to justice for all\u000d\u000a      Gypsy\/Travellers in Scotland. The implications in relation to human rights\u000d\u000a      were acknowledged immediately by the Scottish Government in their `Race\u000d\u000a      Equality Statement' published in December 2009, and in statements on their\u000d\u000a      website including:\u000d\u000a    \"Although it is not in our power to make change in relation to the legal\u000d\u000a      recognition of Scottish Gypsies\/Travellers as an ethnic group since\u000d\u000a      legislation around equal opportunities is reserved, the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government continues to recognise Gypsies\/Travellers as an ethnic group in\u000d\u000a      its work and encourages others to do likewise. The Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      acknowledges that Gypsy\/Traveller communities have specific requirements\u000d\u000a      and require the same level of protection from discrimination and abuse in\u000d\u000a      common with all of Scotland's minority ethnic communities. A recent\u000d\u000a      judgement in relation to an employment tribunal (K. MacLennan Vs.

It notes that these were\u000d\u000a      priorities in the 2005 Equal Opportunity Committee Interim Report and from\u000d\u000a      the Gypsy\/Travellers Steering Group (from 2005-06).\u000d\u000a    BEMIS, the Black and Ethnic Minority Infrastructure in Scotland working\u000d\u000a      group, is a network of ethnic minority organisations convened to address\u000d\u000a      the gap that exists in support for the ethnic minority voluntary sector in\u000d\u000a      Scotland. The BEMIS report `Gypsy Travellers in Contemporary Scotland',\u000d\u000a      2011, (Source 1) cites Clark's research to support many of the points made\u000d\u000a      in the report, including the argument that the Scottish Travellers are a\u000d\u000a      distinct indigenous group.\u000d\u000a      From Chapter 2 p.17 of this report - `Clark (2006) argues that at various\u000d\u000a      stages in Scottish history, dispossessed labourers and other marginalised\u000d\u000a      people may have complemented the original Scottish nomadic. Hence, he\u000d\u000a      argues that it is true that Scottish Gypsy\/Travellers are quite distinct\u000d\u000a      from recent Roma arrivals in Scotland, via government asylum dispersal\u000d\u000a      schemes for example, because they are an indigenous nomadic group' (Source\u000d\u000a      1).\u000d\u000a      It continues to shape policy through debate in the Scottish Parliament,\u000d\u000a      being part of the evidence drawn upon by the Equal Opportunities Committee\u000d\u000a      of the Scottish Parliament in their 2013 hearings addressing where\u000d\u000a      Gypsy\/Travellers live (Source 5), and in the case made by the Equality and\u000d\u000a      Human Rights Commission (Source 4) where a new tick box stating\u000d\u000a      \"Gypsy\/traveller\" has been incorporated into the census which will assist\u000d\u000a      in monitoring accommodation needs for the Gypsy\/Traveller community\u000d\u000a      (Sources 5 and 6) and in relation to employment law (Source 7).\u000d\u000a    The ruling has had implications for service provision for all\u000d\u000a      Gypsy\/Travellers. Across service providers and local authorities, the\u000d\u000a      outcomes of the legal case have been reflected in the guidance issued in\u000d\u000a      relation to social inclusion and discrimination across professions\u000d\u000a      including nursing and health care (Source 8) and social work (Source 9).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Being recognised in law as an `ethnic minority' has far-reaching\u000d\u000a      consequences, including the right of access to welfare and protection from\u000d\u000a      race discrimination. As part of an industrial tribunal case in September\u000d\u000a      2008, research conducted at Strathclyde was used as expert testimony that\u000d\u000a      resulted in giving Gypsy\/Travellers in Scotland such legal status. This\u000d\u000a      judgment has meant that the entire population of this group now has access\u000d\u000a      to protection under Race Relations legislation.

He has been an expert witness in\u000d\u000a      several legal cases in 2000 and 2004. Clark's acknowledged expertise in\u000d\u000a      relation to these groups meant that he was called as a leading\u000d\u000a      international expert in an industrial tribunal case in Scotland in 2008\u000d\u000a      which centred on the legal and cultural definition of Gypsy\/Travellers as\u000d\u000a      an ethnic group.\u000d\u000a    Key findings: The meaning and use of ethnicity has been described\u000d\u000a      as one of the most pressing issues to occupy the social sciences in\u000d\u000a      contemporary times [1]. Across Europe the relationship between the\u000d\u000a      identity and status of Romani and Gypsy\/Traveller communities and\u000d\u000a      ethnicity has been contested in government policy, legal systems and\u000d\u000a      within the communities themselves. Research conducted at Strathclyde has\u000d\u000a      made a distinctive contribution to this debate through its exploration of\u000d\u000a      the social-legal identities of Romani, Gypsy\/Traveller and other minority\u000d\u000a      group within Europe [1, 2, 3], the UK [4] and Scotland specifically [5].\u000d\u000a      Clark's research has highlighted the challenges faced by Gypsy\/Travellers\u000d\u000a      to gain legal ethnic identity across different cultural and political\u000d\u000a      contexts, and the consequences for them in terms of access to social and\u000d\u000a      welfare services, and in securing accommodation and employment. It also\u000d\u000a      interrogated the dangers and risks arising from `matter of fact'\u000d\u000a      assumptions within academic and public discourse that Gypsy\/Travellers\u000d\u000a      were an ethnic minority group under existing Race Relations legislation.\u000d\u000a    Drawing upon European experiences, Clark's research [5] found that the\u000d\u000a      `legal' identity of Gypsy\/Traveller communities was actually\u000d\u000a      unsubstantiated in law. Although the Scottish Parliament had stated in\u000d\u000a      2001 that Scottish Gypsy\/Travellers were 'to be regarded' as an ethnic\u000d\u000a      group in Scotland by public\/state bodies this remained untested. Clark's\u000d\u000a      research concluded that whilst Scottish Gypsy\/Travellers are undoubtedly\u000d\u000a      as much an 'ethnic group' as any other currently protected by the Race\u000d\u000a      Relations Act 1976 (as amended 2000) - now replaced by the Equalities Act\u000d\u000a      2010 - Scottish Gypsy\/Travellers generally lacked the substantive\u000d\u000a      protection of the Act in the Scottish context. It further found that only\u000d\u000a      when a test case comes before the Scottish courts and completes its\u000d\u000a      journey through the legal system, would Gypsy\/Travellers be assured of\u000d\u000a      their rights and protection from discrimination. Although this group's\u000d\u000a      ethnic identity had been defined in Europe [1] and in the UK [4] they\u000d\u000a      continued to face social exclusion and thus needed to resort to legal\u000d\u000a      status to challenge decisions and actions which affected their lives [2,\u000d\u000a      3].\u000d\u000a    In Scotland, although there was a widely accepted view that they were an\u000d\u000a      ethnic group, the research concluded that in the absence of a legal basis\u000d\u000a      this could be challenged under the law, and without this being tested\u000d\u000a      Gypsy\/Travellers remained open to potential discrimination and exclusion.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers: Dr Colin Clark, Lecturer in the School of Social\u000d\u000a    Work and Social Policy University of Strathclyde from January 2005 to August\u000d\u000a    2013 led on all research referred to in this case study.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42634","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since 2009 a comprehensive\u000a        suite of training has been developed, arising from these research\u000a      findings, and extensively delivered.

For example, at a\u000a      conference on 18 April\u000a      2013, the keynote speakers were the Chief Executive of the Equality and\u000a      Human Rights\u000a      Commission and the Department of Communities and Local Government\u000a      Communities Director,\u000a      (deputising for the Minister for Faith, Baroness Warsi, who cancelled as a\u000a      result of Baroness\u000a      Thatcher's funeral). Delegates included leaders of employer bodies,\u000a      service providers and trades\u000a      unions including the CBI, TUC, Chambers of Commerce and Stonewall.(13)\u000a      The focus of this event\u000a      was on equality in employer settings and in service provision, and 100\u000a      delegates from a wide\u000a      range of sectors and settings attended. Many of the participants came from\u000a      Third Sector and\u000a      welfare settings, which are prominent as service providers.\u000a    This work with the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the\u000a      Government Equalities Office\u000a      gave RLP the opportunity to develop religious literacy research and\u000a      training in employer and\u000a      service provider settings, and represents in itself an important impact of\u000a      the original work in HE\u000a      settings. EHRC's evaluation of this work concluded that it had achieved a\u000a      much better mood and\u000a      environment for its engagement with religion or belief issues and groups,\u000a      and had enabled it to\u000a      take this area forward more effectively.(14) As a\u000a      result, the EHRC has since requested a proposal\u000a      for ongoing packages of work to sustain and develop the network of public\u000a      actors which has\u000a      emerged. It is anticipated that this will result in a new commission to\u000a      undertake a suite of practical\u000a      religious literacy activities during 2013-14.(15)\u000a    Likewise, the Department for International Development has drawn on RLPs\u000a      work in developing\u000a      and disseminating it's Faith Partnerships Principles policy, and Dinham\u000a      has been involved in six 1-\u000a      2-1 consultations with DfID's civil service directorate on this, and has\u000a      joined a high level panel of\u000a      experts on religion and belief in international development settings,\u000a      including CEOs of major\u000a      NGOs, such as CAFOD and OXFAM. DfID's religious literacy work has been\u000a      taken as a model\u000a      across Whitehall, and RLP has presented at meetings in the Foreign Office,\u000a      Communities and\u000a      Local Government and the Home Office as a result.\u000a    In September 2013, RLP, and its partners, was able to draw on its growing\u000a      credibility to convene a\u000a      high-level group to establish a pathway for continuing religious literacy\u000a      impact in policy-making\u000a      settings. This includes Lord Rowan Williams (as chair), Lord Justice\u000a      Bernard Rix, Baroness Onora\u000a      O'Neill, Charles Clarke (former Education Secretary and Home Secretary),\u000a      Mark Hammond (CEO\u000a      of the EHRC), Baroness Warsi (Minister for Faith Communities), Professor\u000a      Linda Woodhead (who\u000a      directed the AHRC\/ESRC &#163;12m Religion &amp; Society Programme), Professor\u000a      David Ford (Regius\u000a      Professor of Divinity, Cambridge University), the Chief Rabbi, the Chair\u000a      of the Muslim Council of\u000a      Britain, and Professor Dinham. The specific remit of the group is to\u000a      strategically review the\u000a      effectiveness of law and policy on religion or belief and to make\u000a      recommendations for a change in\u000a      the law.(16)\u000a    The Religious Literacy Programme entered in to partnership with Cambridge\u000a      University in 2011\u000a      and with the Coexist Foundation, based in Washington DC and London, in\u000a      2012. Dinham attended\u000a      an event at the Harvard Club in New York in 2012 to share UK experiences\u000a      with US\u000a      counterparts(17) who have now launched their own\u000a      Religious Literacy Foundation, acknowledging\u000a      the influence of the UK programme. This partnership has led to an\u000a      engagement with senior\u000a      politicians, religious leaders and business leaders in the City of London\u000a      via a Mansion House\u000a      dinner hosted by the Lord Mayor of London, dedicated to `faith and the\u000a      city', and an attached\u000a      roundtable event on religious literacy, at which Professor Dinham\u000a      keynoted, attended by business\u000a      and political leaders.(18) The aim of this initiative is\u000a      to found a long-term purpose-built public home\u000a      for the Religious Literacy Programme in London, and this is being taken\u000a      forward in a partnership\u000a      with the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Inner Temple and the City of\u000a      London.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Adam Dinham's work on religious literacy in secular contexts plays a\u000a      substantial role in challenging\u000a      and enabling policy makers, educators and publics to engage with religion\u000a      and belief identity and\u000a      plurality. He established the Religious Literacy Programme (RLP) to\u000a      address the poor quality of\u000a      conversation about religion and belief amongst policy-makers and\u000a      professionals which his work\u000a      has observed. It began with substantial funding from HEFCE to research and\u000a      respond to\u000a      approaches to religion and belief in universities in the context of\u000a      extremism. This drew attention to\u000a      religion and belief as significant but poorly understood and addressed\u000a      identities. The programme\u000a      then translated findings into practice-focused training which has been\u000a      extensively delivered. RLP\u000a      now also works with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and\u000a      the Government\u000a      Equalities Office (GEO) on religious literacy for employers, trades\u000a      unions, and service providers,\u000a      following the same intentional cycle of research translated in to\u000a      training, and is part of a very senior\u000a      initiative, led by EHRC, to review law and policy at a strategic level.\u000a      The RLP entered in to\u000a      partnership with Cambridge University in 2011 and the Coexist Foundation\u000a      (based in London and\u000a      Washington) in 2012 with the goal of founding a permanent public home in a\u000a      purpose built centre\u000a      in London.

Over the last decade he has bought together his\u000a      training in Theology and\u000a      Religious Studies (BA Cambridge), Social Studies and Social Work (MA\u000a      Brunel), and Politics (PhD\u000a      Goldsmiths) in his inter-disciplinary development of the idea of religious\u000a      literacy as a method. He\u000a      has developed the analysis that the 20th Century was largely supposed to\u000a      be a secular century,\u000a      during which public spheres paid little or no attention to religion and\u000a      belief, while at the same time\u000a      religious forms moved from predominantly Christian and traditional to\u000a      highly multi-faith and post-\u000a      traditional. He concludes that this combination of change in a secular\u000a      context resulted in little\u000a      attention being paid to religion and belief just as it was needed most,\u000a      leaving contemporary society\u000a      largely unable to talk well about religion or belief.(1)\u000a      He shows that this makes it much more difficult\u000a      for people to engage in a realistic understanding of the religious\u000a      landscape now in public and\u000a      professional settings. In his book Faiths, Public Policy and Civil\u000a        Society (Palgrave, 2009) he shows\u000a      how this matters as public policy turns to faiths to fill gaps in welfare\u000a      as states roll back welfare and\u000a      other forms of provision.(2) Likewise in an edited\u000a      collection, Faith in the Public Realm (Policy Press\u000a      2009), a series of controversies and dilemmas are set in practical\u000a      contexts where religion and\u000a      belief have mattered, but the skills have been absent to address them, for\u000a      example, in housing, the\u000a      Third Sector, and schools.(3) He proposes a solution in\u000a      an analysis underpinning the Religious\u000a      Literacy Programme, rooted in new research specifically undertaken in\u000a      university settings to\u000a      understand practical challenges posed by religion and belief identities in\u000a      pedagogy and in\u000a      operations.(4) This informs training for change, and\u000a      generates impact upon institutions' policy and\u000a      practice.\u000a    This programme emerges from Dinham's innovative shaping of the notion of\u000a      `religious literacy' after\u000a      2009 when he was approached to direct a proposed HEFCE-funded programme to\u000a      address\u000a      campus extremism. HEFCE funded `Religious Literacy in Higher Education I'\u000a      between 2010-11\u000a      with &#163;250k of resource; a second phase was funded with an additional &#163;81k\u000a      between 2011-13;\u000a      and, as discussed below, the EHRC also provided funding of &#163;32k to support\u000a      the work between\u000a      2012-13.\u000a    Dinham drew on his earlier research(1) to recast the\u000a      focus, setting religion and belief in the context\u000a      of a balanced, informed, high quality of conversation, rooted in evidence\u000a      and theory, rather than\u000a      knee-jerk reactions. Drawing on dialogue between his academic disciplines,\u000a      formed in part through\u000a      his ESRC seminar series on Faith and Civil Society (2007-08), he urged the\u000a      consideration of\u000a      opportunities and dilemmas, as well as risks. The success of his argument\u000a      for recasting itself\u000a      represents a significant impact and HEFCE has since embedded this approach\u000a      to religious literacy\u000a      in its Equal Opportunities Policy.\u000a    The project began with an analytical review of existing research relating\u000a      to religion and belief in HE\u000a      settings, concluding that HE has been steeped in secular assumptions for\u000a      much of the last century,\u000a      in operations, intellectual culture, and curricula, including professional\u000a      education, and in research\u000a      preoccupations, which have tended to neglect religion and belief.(4)\u000a      This was followed by field\u000a      research with Vice Chancellors and other senior HE leaders to explore\u000a      their attitudes to religion\u000a      and belief.(5) This found that VCs are preoccupied with\u000a      how religion and belief impact upon four key\u000a      areas: student experience; widening participation and\u000a      internationalisation; equality and diversity;\u000a      and good campus relations. It also results in a four-part typology of HE\u000a      stances towards religion\u000a      and belief in terms of: hard neutrality (with a duty to actively preserve\u000a      the `neutrality' of their\u000a      institution); soft neutrality (where religion and belief are treated as\u000a      irrelevant to the institution);\u000a      repositories and resources (where religion and belief are seen as\u000a      enriching of cultural diversity and\u000a      potentially adding value through services such as chaplaincy and\u000a      well-being); and formative-\u000a      collegial (where religion and belief are seen as potentially central\u000a      aspects of students' identity and\u000a      formation within the wider educational journey). This typology is the\u000a      basis of a `stance-taking'\u000a        tool\u000a      available to institutions which has been extensively used in training.\u000a    The programme hypothesised that HE would reflect and reveal religion and\u000a      belief treatments in\u000a      wider society, and it was always the intention that the programme would\u000a      move into other areas,\u000a      especially welfare and the Third Sector, as faith groups increasingly plug\u000a      gaps in shrinking welfare\u000a      states. In 2012, with the support of an Advisory Board of academics,\u000a      policy makers, Third Sector\u000a      and public sector leaders, and representatives of religion and belief\u000a      groups, including non-beliefs,\u000a      Dinham sought engagements with the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u000a      and the\u000a      Government Equality Office, which jointly commissioned and funded the\u000a      programme to research\u000a      their existing capacities and engagements on religion and belief.(6)\u000a      This formed the basis of a\u000a      series of four roundtable dialogue events with more than 180 participants\u000a      from employer bodies,\u000a      trades unions, faith groups, lobby groups, and service provider\u000a      organisations in Spring 2013.\u000a      These used participatory research methods to explore perceptions and\u000a      practices relating to themes\u000a      emerging from the research. This found that employer groups think that\u000a      legal cases have muddied\u000a      rather than clarified the issues; and they perceive law as having\u000a      encouraged an assertion of rights\u000a      at the expense of solutions. An extensive suite of reports has been\u000a      published,(7) and academic\u000a      peer-reviewed outputs will follow in 2014.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42660","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    References below map to sections 3 and 5 respectively.\u000a    Impact on Oxfam's UK Poverty Programme\u000a    Collins's contributions led Oxfam to fund research for their UK Poverty\u000a      Programme. This work (3.2) was reported widely in 2008 (e.g. The\u000a        Herald, July 2008, BBC Scotland News, June 2008) and written\u000a      up for three professional journals. It was used by the Clydebank\u000a      Independent Resource Centre to ensure its survival in a time of cuts\u000a      (2008-present), and used by Oxfam, both in highlighting the plight of\u000a      community organisations to government and in reconfiguring its UK Poverty\u000a      programme in Scotland (2008-present) (5.1).\u000a    This success led to further Oxfam requests for engagement with Collins\u000a      and UWS colleagues. Collins's 2009 report on `Welfare to Work' (3.4),\u000a      again funded by Oxfam, was also widely reported (e.g. BBC Radio Scotland's\u000a      `Good Morning Scotland', April 2009), used by the high profile Scottish\u000a      Campaign on Welfare Reform (e.g, The Herald, 18\/02\/11), featured\u000a      at the annual Document Film Festival in Glasgow (October, 2009), and\u000a      became the subject of high-level discussions between Oxfam and the DWP\u000a      (2009) (5.1).\u000a    Collins also introduced Oxfam to a UWS economist to assist with the\u000a      economic side of Oxfam's policy. This led to Oxfam Scotland's high profile\u000a      Whose Economy? seminar programme (2010-11, co-organised by UWS and\u000a      Oxfam), which in turn provided the basis for its more recent Our\u000a        Economy report and strategy (2013). The report fully acknowledges\u000a      the contribution of UWS staff, and has substantially influenced Oxfam's\u000a      work at UK level and internationally (5.1; 5.2).\u000a    The UWS-Oxfam Partnership\u000a    The growing engagement between UWS and Oxfam led the latter in the summer\u000a      of 2011 to instigate a UWS-Oxfam Partnership (5.1). The Partnership,\u000a      established in 2012 with &#163;50,000 of initial funding from UWS, primarily\u000a      comprises:\u000a    \u000a      A Policy Forum, focused on Oxfam's ongoing policy development and\u000a        advocacy strategy, engaging UWS academics with Oxfam, its community\u000a        partners, and a range of other organisations beyond academia (e.g. NHS;\u000a        SURF; Scottish Community Development Council; New Policy Institute;\u000a        Poverty Alliance; STUC; Scottish Family Business Association);\u000a      A programme of research collaborations (currently nine), initially\u000a        funded by the Partnership, engaging academics with Oxfam and its\u000a        community partners, both to support these organisations and to inform\u000a        Oxfam's policy development and advocacy strategy. Some of these\u000a        collaborations are already producing impacts of their own (5.1).\u000a    \u000a    This Partnership, which Collins leads from the UWS side, is progressing\u000a      well and working towards levering external RKE funding (5.3). It is seen\u000a      by Oxfam as an exemplar for its wider activities (5.1).\u000a    Impact in Public Health Field\u000a    Collins's work impacted significantly on the work of NHS Health Scotland\u000a      and the Glasgow Centre for Population Health (GCPH &#8212; a collaboration\u000a      between NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Glasgow City Council, the Scottish\u000a      Government and the University of Glasgow) (5.4).\u000a    Hitherto, the causes of Scotland's health deficits have been inadequately\u000a      understood. Remedial interventions have had little or no impact. In 2008,\u000a      Collins was approached by an NHS colleague (Gerry McCartney) to\u000a      collaborate on broadening understanding of how immediate causes are linked\u000a      to broader processes of socio-economic and political change (3.3) (5.4).\u000a      Discussions (2009-10) were conducted with key public health figures\u000a      charged with reporting to the Scottish Government.\u000a    From 2010, the two Public Health Programme Managers at the GCPH became\u000a      involved in furthering the work initiated by Collins and McCartney, and\u000a      co-authoring outputs. In 2011, GCPH itself published one of these &#8212; a\u000a      major report endorsing and further developing the broadening of\u000a      perspective advocated by Collins (3.5, see also 3.6). All this work has\u000a      been widely reported in the media, at Scottish level (e.g. The\u000a        Scotsman, August 2011, The Herald, June 2012, Sunday Herald,\u000a      August 2011; BBC Scotland News, November 2012, Scotland on Sunday,\u000a        June 2013), UK level (e.g. The Guardian, June 2011 and\u000a      November 2012, The Economist, August 2012) and internationally\u000a      (e.g. Le Monde, November 2012).\u000a    The ongoing impact is now clearly reflected in the continuing work of NHS\u000a      Health Scotland and the GCPH &#8212; all of which is conducted `beyond academia'\u000a      (5.5, 5.6). It has also informed the critical assessment of prevailing\u000a      interventions focusing on `immediate' causes, to the neglect of `causes of\u000a      the causes' (5.7). This is evident in a recent Herald report on\u000a      the current view of Scotland's Chief Medical Officer, Sir Harry Burns\u000a      (5.7).\u000a    Urban Regeneration and the `Community Voices Network'\u000a    Collins's work raised broad critical awareness of the failings of the\u000a      prevailing regeneration model. From 2006, it raised particular awareness\u000a      as to the nature of the Community Voices Network &#8212; a national community\u000a      organisation, created in 2006, led by a private company and funded by the\u000a      Scottish Executive. This impacted on wider attitudes to the organisation,\u000a      which was subsequently disbanded by the Scottish Government (in 2009)\u000a      (5.8)\u000a    Impact on Trade Union Organisations\u000a    Collins's work played a key role in Clydebank Trades Council's securing a\u000a      2007 Scottish TUC mandate to organise a national conference (`Communities,\u000a      Regeneration and Democracy', September 2008), which Collins addressed.\u000a      This has contributed to ensuring that community engagement and\u000a      regeneration have remained on the agenda of the STUC and individual unions\u000a      (e.g. Unite and Unison). (5.9)\u000a    Collins's research on the UCS Work-In was the basis for a national\u000a      training event for Unite trade union activists (August 2011), and was used\u000a      extensively by FairPley Associates, who organised this training and also\u000a      the wider programme of celebrations for the 40th anniversary of\u000a      the Work-In sponsored by the Unite trade union(in 2011-12). Collins\u000a      provided the material for David Hayman's re-enactment of Jimmy Reid's role\u000a      at the main anniversary event (February, 2012).

He has published &gt;50 articles, books,\u000a      book chapters and reports, and has engaged widely beyond academia. The\u000a      research has developed in 3 phases.\u000a    Phase 1 - 1990s: Focused on:\u000a    \u000a      Working class opposition to neoliberalism in the early 1970s\u000a        (particularly the UCS Work-In), using archival sources to highlight the\u000a        role of language in precipitating Heath's U-turn.\u000a      The Conservatives' New Life for Urban Scotland Programme (1988-98),\u000a        looking at the problem of `community participation', particularly in the\u000a        Ferguslie Park area of Paisley. This research traced the connections\u000a        between politics and policy at UK and Scottish levels, and the New Life\u000a        Programme and its local implementation via `regeneration partnerships'.\u000a        It demonstrated the profoundly dysfunctional dynamic of these\u000a        connections, and their equally profoundly damaging effects on\u000a        communities (3.1).\u000a    \u000a    Phase 2 - Late 1990s-2007: Focused on the evolution of policy\u000a      under New Labour at Westminster and the Lab-Lib coalition at Holyrood,\u000a      highlighting the negative impacts across local communities. It identified\u000a      the continuing failure of policy (2000-2004), and then the (otherwise\u000a      barely noticed) major reorientation of policy in Scotland after 2004. It\u000a      highlighted the role of the Edinburgh financial elite in turning\u000a      regeneration policy towards liberalisation and privatisation, and drew out\u000a      the implications for local communities and trade unions.\u000a    Phase 3 - 2007-2013: Focused on the development of policy under\u000a      the SNP at Holyrood and the Conservative-Lib-Dem coalition at Westminster.\u000a      In this phase the research was taken up in new ways by external parties:\u000a    \u000a      Oxfam commissioned research for its UK Poverty Programme on a key\u000a        community organisation in Clydebank (Clydebank Independent Resource\u000a        Centre &#8212; CIRC), tracing its experience from its early 1970s origins. The\u000a        challenge was to account for its longevity, when so many community\u000a        organisations had ceased to exist. The key finding, based on extensive\u000a        research and delivered in a book-length report, linked this to the\u000a        organisation's long-standing connections with the trade unions in the\u000a        area (3.2). Subsequently, Oxfam commissioned further research with the\u000a        same organisation, looking at the experience of the Labour Government's\u000a        `Welfare to Work' policy. Taking case studies of Incapacity Benefit\u000a        claimants, the research challenged the rationale for the policy and\u000a        illuminated its damaging impacts on individuals and families (3.4).\u000a      From 2008, Collins's research was brought to bear on the issue of\u000a        Scotland's lagging health outcomes. He collaborated with an NHS\u000a        colleague to formulate a new hypothesis, linked to supporting evidence,\u000a        focused on Scotland's higher vulnerability to the damaging effects of\u000a        neo-liberal policies after 1979 (3.3). Continuing research identified\u000a        and evaluated all the proposed hypotheses for Scotland's health\u000a        outcomes, and provided an outline synthesis of the more credible\u000a        hypotheses as the basis for future work (3.5). A further, related\u000a        exercise traced Scotland's longer-term comparative health trends and\u000a        identified the key points of divergence (3.6).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42661","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research described above has impacted directly on policy and\u000d\u000a      practice. The Scottish Government's Hepatitis C Action Plan Phase 1 states\u000d\u000a      that its understanding of what needs to be done to prevent the\u000d\u000a      transmission of hepatitis C among PWID \"has largely been informed by the\u000d\u000a      findings of several key Scottish Executive funded research studies\" (p9)\u000d\u000a      among which are Taylor et al, 2004 and Taylor et al, 2005, both cited in\u000d\u000a      the previous section. It also states that another of Taylor's studies (Roy\u000d\u000a      et al, 2007, cited above) has informed the Action Plan. The aim of the\u000d\u000a      first phase of the Action Plan was to gather evidence for a set of\u000d\u000a      specified of actions aimed at preventing infection and developing specific\u000d\u000a      proposals for improvements in services. One of the Prevention Actions\u000d\u000a      (Action 2) arose directly from the findings of Taylor's ethnographic work\u000d\u000a      cited above. It stated \"these interventions should\u000d\u000a      include.....distributing a wide range of paraphernalia in addition to\u000d\u000a      needles and syringes in needle exchanges; and labelling or colour coding\u000d\u000a      of injecting equipment to help drug users identify their own\" (P10). Based\u000d\u000a      on her expertise, Professor Taylor was asked to chair the Prevention\u000d\u000a      Working Group of the Action Plan, Phase 1.\u000d\u000a    The second phase of the Scottish Government's Hepatitis C Action Plan\u000d\u000a      aimed at implementing the proposals arising from Phase 1. The Government\u000d\u000a      invested &#163;43 million over the three years of the Action Plan, &#163;8 million\u000d\u000a      of which was dedicated to prevention. Two Actions were influence by\u000d\u000a      Taylor's ethnographic work, \"Examining the Injecting Practices of Drug\u000d\u000a      Injectors\" cited above (ref 4 above). Action 14 proposed the\u000d\u000a      development of national guidelines for services providing injecting\u000d\u000a      equipment to PWID to ensure consistency across services in Scotland.\u000d\u000a      Action 15 stated that improvements to services should be made in\u000d\u000a      accordance with the Guidelines and these had to include increasing\u000d\u000a      provision and uptake of injecting paraphernalia as well as provision of\u000d\u000a      colour coded equipment. Professor Taylor was asked to chair the Guidelines\u000d\u000a      Development Group and the Guidelines for Services Providing Injecting\u000d\u000a      Equipment were published in 2010 but Health Boards had access to them from\u000d\u000a      2009.\u000d\u000a    The Guidelines recommended that all items of injecting paraphernalia\u000d\u000a      should be provided for each injection, free of charge. This has coincided\u000d\u000a      with a significant increase in the provision of paraphernalia from\u000d\u000a      Scotland's injecting equipment provision services: 350,000 filters and\u000d\u000a      500,000 spoons were provided between April 2009 and March 2009, prior to\u000d\u000a      the publication of the Guidelines and this had risen to 2,534,289 filters\u000d\u000a      and 2,527,480 spoons between April 2011 and March 2012.\u000d\u000a    Professor Taylor was also commissioned to lead on and undertake the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government funded \"Needle Exchange Surveillance Initiative\" to\u000d\u000a      monitor the impact of the prevention actions of the Hepatitis C Action\u000d\u000a      Plan, Phase II (Action 22 of the Action Plan Phase II). This includes\u000d\u000a      monitoring on an annual basis the prevalence, incidence, risk behaviours\u000d\u000a      and uptake of services for hepatitis C among PWID attending injecting\u000d\u000a      equipment provision services in all mainland health boards in Scotland.\u000d\u000a      Three sweeps of the study have been undertaken. Papers arising from this\u000d\u000a      have indicated i) that the expansion of injecting equipment recommended by\u000d\u000a      the Guidelines has coincided with greater uptake of injecting\u000d\u000a      paraphernalia and this, in turn, is associated with safer injecting\u000d\u000a      practices1 and ii) that high coverage of needle and syringe\u000d\u000a      programmes can substantially reduce the risk of hepatitis C transmission\u000d\u000a      among people who inject drugs(ref 6 above).\u000d\u000a    The study \"Examining the Injecting Practices of Drug Injectors\" has also\u000d\u000a      led to the commercial development of coloured syringes to reduce the\u000d\u000a      occurrence of syringe sharing and also to the development of a training\u000d\u000a      DVD (\"The Injecting Process: Viral Transmission\"), in which Professor\u000d\u000a      Taylor and her team demonstrate the multiple risks for infection during\u000d\u000a      the injecting process. The DVD has been distributed widely to healthcare\u000d\u000a      workers and service providers, both in the UK and internationally. The\u000d\u000a      study also resulted in numerous invitations to present the study in the UK\u000d\u000a      and other countries, often to drug service and healthcare workers. The\u000d\u000a      invitations included presenting at the UK Advisory Committee on the Misuse\u000d\u000a      of Drugs (ACMD) in 2004, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs in\u000d\u000a      Ireland in 2004, and organising and presenting at a symposium at the\u000d\u000a      International Conference on the Reduction of Drug Related Harm in 2005.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The research reported here has influenced the Scottish Government's\u000d\u000a      Hepatitis C Action Plans and led to changes in practice in services\u000d\u000a      providing sterile injecting equipment to people who inject drugs (PWID) in\u000d\u000a      Scotland and to reductions in risk behaviours for hepatitis C infection\u000d\u000a      among this population.

The aim of the\u000d\u000a      research has been to determine the prevalence, incidence and associated\u000d\u000a      risk factors for transmission of hepatitis C among PWID in Scotland.\u000d\u000a    All of the research has been led by Professor Taylor, Chair in Public\u000d\u000a      Health at the time of the research. Key collaborators are colleagues at\u000d\u000a      Health Protection Scotland and research staff at UWS.\u000d\u000a    Hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus, is a major public health problem,\u000d\u000a      described by the Scottish Government in 2004 as \"one of the most serious\u000d\u000a      and significant public health risks of our generation\"1.\u000d\u000a      Globally, approximately 10 million people are affected by hepatitis C.\u000d\u000a      PWID are disproportionally more likely to be infected with hepatitis C,\u000d\u000a      with upwards to 90% of PWID infected in comparison with ~2% of the general\u000d\u000a      population. Incidence of new infections is estimated as at least 10% per\u000d\u000a      annum. The main route of transmission for PWID is through injecting with\u000d\u000a      contaminated injecting equipment.\u000d\u000a    The research described here has shown the extent of the infection among\u000d\u000a      Scottish PWID and risk behaviours which contribute to transmission both\u000d\u000a      before and after implementation of new policies. The early research\u000d\u000a      indicated that 90% of PWID in Scotland had been infected with hepatitis C2\u000d\u000a      (Roy et al) and that incidence of infection was steady at 20-30 infections\u000d\u000a      per 100 person years of injecting2. Professor Taylor and her\u000d\u000a      team also collected information that showed that not all PWID were aware\u000d\u000a      of the amount of needles and syringes they were entitled to obtain at\u000d\u000a      needle exchanges, even after a specially targeted campaign, nor did some\u000d\u000a      services inform them of this3. One study that has had a major\u000d\u000a      impact on policy and practice was a groundbreaking ethnographic study, the\u000d\u000a      first in the UK and one of few worldwide, that filmed PWID injecting in\u000d\u000a      their homes and other \"natural\" settings. Funded by the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government to examine injecting practices and identify where risks for\u000d\u000a      transmission arose, it clearly demonstrated the multiple opportunities for\u000d\u000a      infection in the injecting process, including the extent of sharing other\u000d\u000a      injecting paraphernalia (spoons, water and filters) including the risk of\u000d\u000a      accidental sharing of commonly stored, previously used needles and\u000d\u000a      syringes and preparing drugs in batches with a previously used\u000d\u000a      needle\/syringe and sharing the batch between groups of PWID. It also\u000d\u000a      ascertained that PWID had a poor understanding of the risks of\u000d\u000a      transmission associated with these behaviours and indicated that PWID\u000d\u000a      lacked knowledge of transmission of hepatitis C4.\u000d\u000a    More recent research by Professor Taylor and colleagues is beginning to\u000d\u000a      indicate that the changes in interventions influenced by the findings\u000d\u000a      described above are coinciding with positive changes on risk behaviours\u000d\u000a      and rates of incident infections. For example, the independent effect of\u000d\u000a      needle\/syringe provision on incident HCV infection has been demonstrated\u000d\u000a      using a novel method of testing dried blood spots for recent infection\u000d\u000a      utilising the \"window period\" 5. (After infection with HCV,\u000d\u000a      antibodies cannot be detected in blood for several weeks but virus can be\u000d\u000a      detected from about 2 weeks after infection. The period between presence\u000d\u000a      of virus and antibody is known as the \"window period\". Samples testing\u000d\u000a      positive for virus but negative for antibody are classified as recent or\u000d\u000a      incident infections.) Further work has also shown that the uptake of\u000d\u000a      injecting equipment has increased and that the proportions reporting\u000d\u000a      sharing needles and syringes and other paraphernalia were significantly\u000d\u000a      lower in 2010 than in 2008\/96.

However, the primary impact\u000a      emerged from a series of studies in 2005-07. These studies focused on\u000a      policy issues relating to the regulation of child employment.\u000a    Two collaborative projects were carried out with Cumbria County Council\u000a      and the NSPCC from 2004-2007. The first project focused on children's\u000a      understanding of their exposure to risk in the workplace while the second\u000a      project consisted of an intervention study targeted at improving the\u000a      effectiveness of the regulatory framework (McKechnie et al, 2007; 2009).\u000a      This work raised awareness for the County Council and resulted in the\u000a      NSPCC placing child employment on its agenda. The publication of the\u000a      findings (McKechnie et al, 2007) resulted in the NSPCC organising a\u000a      conference on child employment (18th July 2008), involving\u000a      policy makers and practitioners to discuss the findings from these\u000a      studies. This was followed by an NSPCC conference\/event for young people\u000a      on the issue of child employment (5.2 ; 5.5).\u000a    Hobbs &amp; McKechnie's work in Cumbria (Hobbs and McKechnie, 1997) has\u000a      influenced the approach to the regulation of child employment. The 2005\u000a      and 2007 reports affected the way the authority saw the child employment\u000a      officer's role in regulating child employment in the region. This was at a\u000a      time when the children's services were being reorganised, and the findings\u000a      identified the contribution of this service within the local authority\u000a      (5.3).\u000a    The intervention study (McKechnie et al, 2007; 2009) and the national\u000a      study of young people's employment (Howieson et al, 2006) were used by\u000a      non-governmental organisations in their programme of awareness raising and\u000a      lobbying (5.2). The National Network of Child Employment and Entertainment\u000a      Officers (NNCEE) drew on this work and other research outputs from Hobbs\u000a      and McKechnie to lobby government on the need to review policy and\u000a      regulation in this area. This lobbying was a contributory factor to the\u000a      then Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) establishing an\u000a      evaluation study of the regulatory framework in England (5.2). This\u000a      project initially set up by the DCSF, was continued after the last\u000a      election by the Department of Education (DfE).\u000a    Hobbs and McKechnie's work has also contributed to training days for the\u000a      NNCEE and presentations at their national conferences (5.2).\u000a    Hobbs and McKechnie's work has also raised awareness of child employment\u000a      for government bodies. The presentation of the 2007 intervention study\u000a      findings led representatives from the Isle of Man's Department of\u000a      Education and Children (DfEC) to investigate the nature and extent of\u000a      child employment and the effectiveness of its regulatory system, which\u000a      differs from that used in Britain. This resulted in the DfEC supporting a\u000a      study of child employment and its regulation on the island, 2010-13 (5.1).\u000a      This study carried out by McKechnie and Hobbs's PhD student, Emma Littler,\u000a      reported in July 2013. The findings provided the DfEC with the first data\u000a      on the nature and extent of child employment, and identified weaknesses in\u000a      the island's regulatory system.\u000a    McKechnie, Hobbs and Littler were invited to present the findings to the\u000a      Minister for Education, the DfEC's Chief Executive Officer and senior DfEC\u000a      staff in July 2013. As a result of this, the Department is currently\u000a      reviewing its policy and practice (5.1).\u000a    The review of policy is at the heart of the most recent research output.\u000a      In 2009-10 the DCSF initiated a project to evaluate the current regulatory\u000a      system in England and to consider alternative approaches to regulation\u000a      (5.2 ; 5.4). McKechnie and Hobbs, along with colleagues from Edinburgh\u000a      University (Cathy Howieson and Sheila Semple), were awarded the contract.\u000a      McKechnie was the principal investigator. Post-2010 election the DfE (the\u000a      re-named DCSF) continued with this review. The report (McKechnie et al,\u000a      2011; 2013) drew attention to the major issues concerning current practice\u000a      in this area and contributed to the Department's review of child\u000a      employment (5.4). The review process ended in 2012 with the decision not\u000a      to proceed with changes in the current regulations.\u000a    In the period under review Hobbs and McKechnie's research output has\u000a      raised awareness of a common, yet neglected, experience for young people\u000a      in Britain.

The research has had three principal\u000a      strands;\u000a    (i) establishing the nature and extent of child employment &#8212;\u000a      their research has shown that the majority of young people will have\u000a      experience of paid employment before reaching the end of compulsory\u000a      schooling. The finding established in their 1990s research was challenged\u000a      by some but was supported in the first nationally representative in-depth\u000a      study in the UK of this type of employment (Howieson, McKechnie &amp;\u000a      Semple, 2006). McKechnie was joint principal investigator on this project\u000a      with colleagues from Edinburgh and Strathclyde University. Hobbs was a\u000a      consultant on the project.\u000a    McKechnie &amp; Hobbs also established that child employees work in a\u000a      wide range of jobs, many equated with adult part time work. In doing so\u000a      they challenged the stereotype that young people work predominantly in\u000a      `children's jobs' such as paper rounds.\u000a    (ii) the costs and benefits of child employment &#8212; McKechnie &amp;\u000a      Hobbs challenged the dominant view that employment for this age group is\u000a      necessarily a negative experience, a view embedded within international\u000a      debates on `child labour'. They developed an alternative model, the\u000a      Balance Model, which argued that employment for this group has potentially\u000a      positive and negative outcomes (Hobbs &amp; McKechnie, 1997; 2007). They\u000a      set out the key variables which have an impact on the outcome of\u000a      children's experience of employment. This model has been adopted at the\u000a      international level.\u000a    (iii) evaluation of policy and practice in regulating child employment\u000a      &#8212; the regulation of child employees is controlled by legislation in\u000a      Britain. This legislation establishes the parameters and circumstances\u000a      under which children can be employed. Local Authorities are then charged\u000a      with ensuring that these regulations are complied with. In a series of\u000a      studies McKechnie &amp; Hobbs have shown that the regulatory framework\u000a      fails to protect young employees and that the majority work illegally.\u000a      These findings were first reported in a series of reports for local\u000a      authorities including Cumbria County Council, Blackburn and North\u000a      Tyneside. (Hobbs &amp; McKechnie, 1997). Further research on the failings\u000a      of the regulatory system have recently been published in peer reviewed\u000a      journals (McKechnie et al, 2007; McKechnie et al 2009; McKechnie et al,\u000a      2013).\u000a    This research has identified a number of failings in the current\u000a      regulatory framework. Their recent work for the Department of Education\u000a      (2011) showed that the key legislation in this area does not reflect\u000a      children's experiences in contemporary society. At the local authority\u000a      level the problem of non-compliance by employers\/child employees stems\u000a      from lack of awareness of the legislation; poor enforcement strategies;\u000a      under-resourcing due to lack of awareness of levels of employment; low\u000a      prioritisation of the issue at local and central government. McKechnie\u000a      &amp; Hobbs have also carried out intervention studies which reduced the\u000a      levels of illegal employment (McKechnie et al, 2007) and evaluated\u000a      alternative regulatory approaches (McKechnie et al, 2011).\u000a    This body of work was carried out by Hobbs &amp; McKechnie whilst based\u000a      at the University of the West of Scotland (previously University of\u000a      Paisley) with the support of PhD students and research assistants. In two\u000a      recent funded projects, one for the Scottish Government in 2004-06 and one\u000a      for the Department of Education 2010-11, they have collaborated with\u000a      colleagues Dr Cathy Howieson (Edinburgh University) and Sheila Semple\u000a      (University of Strathclyde).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42766","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A Diversity\u000a        and Progression Toolkit was developed for use by academics and\u000a      practice educators to assist them in addressing common challenges.

It also commenced\u000a      its engagement with the social work academic community by presenting the\u000a      findings at the Joint University Council's Social Work Education Committee\u000a      Conference. This is the key forum at which the international social work\u000a      academic community debate teaching and learning. As a direct consequence,\u000a      a number of HEIs registered an interest in using the Toolkit and the\u000a      activities it suggests.(4)\u000a    The Toolkit has been rolled out in two workshops hosted at Goldsmiths\u000a      during 2012 and 2013. These workshops brought together a range of\u000a      stakeholders including academics from the USA, Canada, Spain and the UK\u000a      who are interested in social pedagogy for transformative practice. The\u000a      workshops created a space to get the research messages into practice, and\u000a      to communicate the benefits of the research.

In 2012 the research team participated in a\u000a      Higher Education Academy-sponsored debate on Race in Social Work, at\u000a      Salford University. The purpose of this event was to bring together social\u000a      work academics from HEIs across the UK who have a commitment to developing\u000a      inclusive learning and teaching to engage diverse student groups. These\u000a      debates are part of wider discussion about race and the learning\u000a      environment, intended to develop pedagogic approaches that might\u000a      contribute to good outcomes for students.(2,5,6)\u000a    The findings from the research underpinning the Toolkit have been\u000a      presented at major national and international conferences and published in\u000a      reputable peer-reviewed journals.

Previous research on students'\u000a      experiences of social work courses highlighted that these groups of\u000a      students face particular obstacles to their learning, and were at greater\u000a      risk of non-completion or took longer to complete their courses. The\u000a      quantitative data on student progression rates in England showed wide\u000a      variations in the completion rates for this group of students, and there\u000a      were concerns within the social work education community about their\u000a      progression. We sought through our research to find out what factors were\u000a      impacting on students' experiences. The research therefore used a\u000a      qualitative approach to investigate the particular circumstances of black\u000a      and ethnic minority students, disabled students, and lesbian and gay\u000a      students, to identify how individual and institutional factors contribute\u000a      to their experiences on social work courses.(1)\u000a    This particular research group was selected on the grounds of a proposal\u000a      to the Department of Health (DH), which funded the project &#8212; &#163;106K &#8212; as\u000a      one of nine research projects in the Social Care Workforce Research\u000a      Programme covering recruitment and retention; graduating in social work;\u000a      skills, training and qualification; and new ways of working. The project\u000a      was therefore about change from the outset, as the Department of Health\u000a      (which was the government department responsible for social work education\u000a      at the time) was keen to generate knowledge that could be used to bring\u000a      about change in workforce development.\u000a    Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups\u000a      from a total of 95 students including 66 Black and ethnic minority, 16\u000a      disabled and 13 lesbian gay and bisexual students.(1,3,4) Nine\u000a      focus groups were conducted and they included one with lesbian, gay and\u000a      bisexual students, six with black and ethnic minority students, and two\u000a      with disabled students. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were\u000a      conducted with a wide range of education providers (programme directors,\u000a      tutors, practice learning coordinators, and student support services'\u000a      staff).\u000a    The study found that areas of inequality in social work education could\u000a      still be identified, despite the introduction of a range of initiatives\u000a      and policies designed to counteract them. The study highlighted a number\u000a      of factors that had a bearing on student engagement, which in turn could\u000a      affect timely progression.(5) The cumulative effect of combined\u000a      and intersecting disadvantage, (for example, for dyslexic black and ethnic\u000a      minority students with financial as well as caring responsibilities),\u000a      meant that certain students were particularly vulnerable to delayed\u000a      progression. However, many participants were able to overcome cumulative\u000a      disadvantage and barriers to progression, suggesting levels of persistence\u000a      and resilience, which rendered them well suited to the demands of\u000a      contemporary social work practice (6). Participants from all three target\u000a      groups experienced feelings of marginalisation and reported divisions in\u000a      the learning environment. However, black and ethnic minority and disabled\u000a      students were more likely to report that this had affected their academic\u000a      confidence. Factors mitigating feelings of marginalisation included:\u000a      support provided by personal tutors and practice assessors; more\u000a      opportunities to work in small groups; anonymous marking; effective use of\u000a      the VLE and internal resources of self-belief and determination.(4)\u000a    The primary output of this research has been a substantive report\u000a      submitted to the Department of Health on 11 February 2011.(1)\u000a      The initial findings were presented at the Social Care Workforce Research\u000a      Initiative at the Department of Health in November 2010.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43072","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our wider research impacts\u000d\u000a      Twenty years of influential research by the University of Southampton's\u000d\u000a      Work Futures Research Centre have informed international public and\u000d\u000a      practitioner understandings of managing and adapting to organisational\u000d\u000a      change.

Spending cuts necessitate fundamental\u000d\u000a      redesigns to public sector work and organizations, and longer term changes\u000d\u000a      to the structure of the workforce are underway. Employees' expectations\u000d\u000a      are shifting as the workforce becomes more diverse, and employers are\u000d\u000a      struggling to adapt organisational cultures to changing gender, race and\u000d\u000a      age profiles.\u000d\u000a    The University of Southampton's research into changing forms of work and\u000d\u000a      organisation began in the late 1990s with studies by Susan Halford,\u000d\u000a      Professor of Sociology, and Pauline Leonard, Professor of Sociology, into\u000d\u000a      issues of gender and race in the workplace. In 2010, Halford and Leonard\u000d\u000a      co-founded the Work Futures Research Centre (WFRC), a University Strategic\u000d\u000a      Research Group. They provided evidence of sustained inequalities despite\u000d\u000a      legislative and cultural change. Their 2001 book Gender, Power and\u000d\u000a      Organizations [3.1], is a defining text in the field, adopted in\u000d\u000a      countries from Brazil to Finland and Australia as a key teaching text and\u000d\u000a      receiving 200 citations (Google Scholar).\u000d\u000a    Halford and Leonard's ESRC project (1997-2001) on gender, race and\u000d\u000a      professional identities in the NHS established the importance of\u000d\u000a      differentiation between hospitals in professional identities and work\u000d\u000a      practices. Based on this, a 2003 report [3.2] found racism\u000d\u000a      manifest in access to training and careers among UK graduates,\u000d\u000a      highlighting the need for more transparency in selection processes. A 2006\u000d\u000a      book [3.3] drew on empirical research of doctors and nurses in the\u000d\u000a      NHS to show how gendered organisational cultures impact on individuals'\u000d\u000a      identities in their daily working lives.\u000d\u000a    More recently, Halford and Leonard turned to how the physical design of\u000d\u000a      workplaces affects employee wellbeing and productivity. A study in 2008\u000d\u000a      funded by The British Council of Offices (BCO) explored the effect of\u000d\u000a      office design on performance, productivity and practice in FTSE 100\u000d\u000a      companies and public sector organizations. Leonard found [3.4]\u000d\u000a      workplace design has a significant bearing on individuals' motivation,\u000d\u000a      working relationships and wellbeing, leading her to devise new models of\u000d\u000a      consultation that can be replicated in other work environments. She\u000d\u000a      discovered scepticism among employees towards environmental initiatives,\u000d\u000a      which are often viewed as cost- cutting measures.\u000d\u000a    From 2007 to 2013 Halford carried out studies [3.5, 3.6] into how\u000d\u000a      increasing digitisation of healthcare work impacts on the organization and\u000d\u000a      delivery of services. Two projects funded by the RCN (2005, 2010) examined\u000d\u000a      the impact telemedicine, electronic booking and large scale information\u000d\u000a      systems have on the professional and organizational aspects of healthcare\u000d\u000a      work; in particular for older workers. In two National Institute for\u000d\u000a      Health Research (NIHR) projects (2008, 2011), Halford evaluated a new\u000d\u000a      Computer Decision Support System (CDSS) for emergency and urgent care,\u000d\u000a      intended to achieve workforce savings by enabling clerical staff to make\u000d\u000a      clinical decisions and to rationalize and integrate services in line with\u000d\u000a      Darzi recommendations. She also explored work, training and organizational\u000d\u000a      practices required to implement CDSS. An evaluation of the NHS 111\u000d\u000a      service, to replace NHS Direct, found that the work required to make the\u000d\u000a      system function effectively was considerable and varied significantly from\u000d\u000a      place to place. This research demonstrated that innovations are not quick\u000d\u000a      or cheap technical fixes to current funding constraints.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43073","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The University of Southampton's research on statistical modelling for\u000a      migration, and on\u000a      producing accurate population estimates and projections, has improved the\u000a      daily working methods\u000a      of public bodies that rely on population statistics in their forecasts and\u000a      decision-making, ultimately\u000a      affecting the users of public services all across the UK. The team has\u000a      shown how data limitations\u000a      can be overcome by using statistical modelling to produce more reliable\u000a      and detailed migration\u000a      estimates and forecasts, with associated measures of uncertainty. They\u000a      demonstrated, for\u000a      example, how administrative sources like student registers, NHS registers\u000a      and National Insurance\u000a      data, can be used to supplement traditional survey data used by the ONS.\u000a    In the UK, this work has become an integral part of ONS operations. The\u000a      final report\u000a      of the Migration Statistics Improvement Programme (ONS 2012a [5.1])\u000a      mentions four areas of\u000a        improvement which resulted directly from the team's work and\u000a      recommendations:\u000a    \u000a      Demographic models for migration and population estimates;\u000a      Long-term international immigration estimates;\u000a      Measures of uncertainty in population statistics (reported in detail\u000a        in ONS 2012b [5.2]); and\u000a      Conceptual frameworks.\u000a    \u000a    These methodological changes are of national significance and\u000a      increase the national\u000a        capability to accurately estimate population at a variety of\u000a      geographic levels. The work on\u000a      measuring uncertainty in population estimates has fed into professional\u000a      guidelines of the ONS and\u000a      its customers, providing the users of public statistics \"with better\u000a        information regarding the\u000a        uncertainty associated with the local authority mid-year estimates\"\u000a      (ONS 2012b [5.2], p.1). Here,\u000a      the reach and significance of the research impact go far beyond the\u000a      methodology of official\u000a      statistics, indirectly affecting the national economy and public\u000a        sphere. Good quality population\u000a      estimates and projections are crucial for transparent and fair allocation\u000a        of public funds in such\u000a      areas as social services, education, police, fire and rescue, highway\u000a      maintenance, or environment\u000a      and culture, where they are explicitly used in many of the allocation\u000a      formulae (CLG 2013 [5.3]).\u000a      The ONS estimates also serve as benchmarks for calculating standardised\u000a      mortality rates, used in\u000a      allocating funds to Clinical Commissioning Groups of the National Health\u000a      Service (NHS 2013\u000a      [5.4]).\u000a    To quote the ONS in regard to the conceptual framework developed by\u000a      Southampton's\u000a      researchers, \"[it has benefited] users of population statistics,\u000a        including analysts, statisticians,\u000a        researchers as well as policy and decision makers), [...] data providers\u000a        to understand the context\u000a        and uses to which their data are put, [and] producers of population\u000a        statistics to provide a basis on\u000a        which to prioritise future developments in population statistics, and\u000a        communicate latest data and\u000a        put data in proper context\" (ONS 2012a [5.1], p. 6). The\u000a      framework gives details of the component\u000a      parts of the population statistics model, together with the data sources\u000a      used to estimate these\u000a      parts. In particular, it examines how individual sources such as the\u000a      Census, surveys and\u000a      administrative data differ in terms of quality and coverage.\u000a    The ONS states that, in relation to Southampton's guidelines and\u000a      recommendations which\u000a      were implemented to change the current practice in order to meet the\u000a      Eurostat requirements for\u000a      statistics on international migration, following the MIMOSA project, \"for\u000a        the first time since the\u000a        regulation was introduced, the UK was considered compliant with the\u000a        requirements under Article 3\u000a        of Regulation 862\/2007.\" [U1] This meant that the UK could\u000a      fulfil its statistical requirements under\u000a      EU law, avoiding a potentially significant fine.\u000a    Southampton's current work on future migration assumptions has also been\u000a      found\u000a      \"...important to ensure the ongoing relevance and accuracy of the\u000a        projections which are used\u000a        widely across government for planning and policy making\"\u000a      [U2] in areas such as fiscal\u000a      sustainability, pensions, health and education. The wider societal impact\u000a      is significant, even\u000a      notwithstanding the issue of direct allocation of government funds.\u000a      Population projections form the\u000a      base of forecasts for the economy and public finance prepared by the\u000a      Office for Budgetary\u000a      Responsibility, analyses of future workforce and pension provision by the\u000a      Department for Work and\u000a      Pensions, actuarial analysis for the public sector carried out by the\u000a      Government Actuary's\u000a      Department, or various types of macroeconomic studies by the Bank of\u000a      England.\u000a    The ONS has described its collaboration with the University of\u000a      Southampton as having\u000a      made an invaluable contribution to the development of more accurate\u000a      population and migration\u000a      estimates [U3]. The Southampton team has put the ONS \"...in an\u000a        excellent position to think about\u000a        the gaps and the priorities for the future.\" [U4] As part of\u000a      a Beyond 2011 programme, the ONS is\u000a      working on alternatives to the national Census, including dropping it\u000a      altogether in favour of\u000a      Southampton's modelling approach to the various data streams to which they\u000a      have access.\u000a    Southampton's research was already highlighted in a 2009 UK Statistics\u000a      Authority report\u000a      entitled `Migration Statistics: The way ahead?' In Part 2 of the\u000a      report, it stated: \"There is a strong\u000a        case for constructing synthetic estimates of migration statistics [...]\u000a        Raymer and colleagues at the\u000a        University of Southampton have been applying the methods to current UK\u000a        and European migration\u000a        data. A shared official and academic programme of such synthetic\u000a        estimates should be\u000a        considered.\" (UK Statistics Authority 2009 [5.5], p. 105).\u000a      The current case study presents selected\u000a      outcomes of the implementation of this programme in practice within the\u000a      REF impact period.\u000a    Currently, the Southampton team is looking into impacts of their work on\u000a      modelling\u000a      migration in Europe, carried out in 2009-2012 in the IMEM project. In\u000a      terms of impact, the research\u000a      is directly targeted at the EU-level public statistics (Eurostat) and\u000a      decision-making (European\u000a      Commission), fulfilling the requirements for harmonised migration\u000a      statistics stipulated by recent EU\u000a      law. During the latest meeting of the Eurostat Working Group on Migration\u000a      Statistics in 2012, it\u000a      was explicitly stated that:\u000a    \"the research project `Integrated Modelling of European Migration'\u000a        (IMEM) by the\u000a        University of Southampton could be used as a starting point to develop a\u000a        model of intra-EU\u000a        migration. This might provide a useful benchmark to assess the accuracy\u000a        of reported\u000a        migration flows. Eurostat reported that it was following this project\u000a        with interest, noting\u000a        that some aspects of the IMEM project built upon the earlier MIMOSA\u000a        project that was\u000a        funded by Eurostat.\" (Eurostat 2012 [5.6], p. 3)\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In the UK and the rest of Europe, public bodies and policymakers have\u000a      struggled to quantify\u000a      migration and make accurate population forecasts because of inconsistent\u000a      data from a variety of\u000a      disparate sources.

Whether used to\u000a      inform decisions on funding for infrastructure and amenities, or for\u000a      economic forecasting, accurate\u000a      population data is crucial. But in the European Union, the study of\u000a      international migration, which is\u000a      so important to the understanding of population change, has been hindered\u000a      by problems with data\u000a      availability, quality and consistency. A study by Poulain et al. in 2006\u000a      showed that harmonisation of\u000a      data collection processes and the data they generate was not even close to\u000a      being realised.\u000a    The University of Southampton's Statistical Sciences Research Institute\u000a      and the Economic\u000a      and Social Research Council's Centre for Population Change forged a\u000a      collaboration to tackle this\u000a      problem. A team led by James Raymer, Professor of Demography (2004 to\u000a      present), Jakub Bijak,\u000a      Lecturer in Demography (2009 to present), and Peter W. F. Smith, Professor\u000a      of Social Statistics\u000a      (1990 to present), have researched the accuracy and analysis of migration\u000a      data and worked with\u000a      government bodies to improve their understanding of population dynamics.\u000a      During the REF impact\u000a      period, they have used that knowledge to work directly with those\u000a      government bodies to\u000a      significantly improve their use and understanding of the statistics\u000a      available to them.\u000a    Raymer and Bijak completed a three-year Migration Modelling for\u000a      Statistical Analyses\u000a      (`MIMOSA') project on estimating international migration flows and stocks\u000a      in Europe in 2009 [G1].\u000a      The MIMOSA project was funded by Eurostat, the statistical office of the\u000a      European Union, which\u000a      was unable to reconcile migration data provided by member states. Bijak\u000a      joined Southampton for\u000a      the last year of the project but was involved in it from the beginning at\u000a      CEFMR, Warsaw.\u000a    The team developed a modelling approach to estimate international\u000a      migration flows\u000a      between countries in Europe. For the first time, a methodology was\u000a      developed for obtaining reliable\u000a      and consistent estimates of international migration between European\u000a      countries, and to estimate\u000a      the missing data. In particular, a categorical data analysis approach [3.1,\u000a        3.2] was applied to the\u000a      structures in the migration flow tables, representing the gross flows of\u000a      immigration and emigration\u000a      and the associations between countries. The work has been subsequently\u000a      extended in a project on\u000a      Integrated Modelling of European Migration (`IMEM') [G2], which\u000a      uses the Bayesian statistical\u000a      approach to analyse the uncertainty of the migration estimates, while\u000a      accounting for the many\u000a      differences in definitions, quality and sources of available migration\u000a      data. In parallel, innovative\u000a      methodologies for migration forecasting have been developed [3.3].\u000a    The MIMOSA estimates [3.4] provided valuable insights into the\u000a      overall picture of\u000a      population movements, as well as suggesting areas for further improvement\u000a      in the modelling\u000a      approach. EU regulations state that a breakdown of `scientifically based'\u000a      statistics on migration\u000a      must be submitted to Eurostat by each member state. Failure to meet the\u000a      requirements has the\u000a      potential to result in a hefty fine. The Southampton team advised the UK's\u000a      Office of National\u000a      Statistics on how to improve their methodology and suggested\u000a      methodological improvements to be\u000a      implemented by the ONS, like pooling data and estimating age distributions\u000a      over time. The ONS\u000a      subsequently commissioned the Southampton team to work on five projects.\u000a      In the first one Bijak\u000a      has performed an independent review of methods for distributing\u000a      international immigration\u000a      estimates to sub-national regions. In the second project Raymer and other\u000a      co-authors delivered\u000a      recommendations for how the ONS could improve the migration statistics\u000a      sent to Eurostat to fulfil\u000a      its legal obligation of quality data reporting. The third project, by\u000a      Smith, Raymer and Bijak,\u000a      assessed uncertainty in the ONS mid-year population estimates. The fourth\u000a      one, by Raymer and\u000a      co-authors, put together the first ever conceptual framework for UK\u000a      population and migration\u000a      statistics. Recently, Bijak was also commissioned by the ONS to overhaul\u000a      the methodology behind\u000a      the international migration assumptions in population projections.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43074","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As a direct result of their research, members of CPC and CRA have engaged\u000a      with leading international, national and local policymakers throughout the\u000a      impact assessment period, with their research findings influencing policy\u000a      debate and informing policy design at all levels.\u000a    In summer of 2009, Evandrou and Falkingham's research (ref [3.1],\u000a      then available as a working paper) was selected by Elizabeth Sclater, an\u000a      advisor to the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission, for submission as\u000a      evidence to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against\u000a      Women (CEDAW) and \"provided valuable reference material\" [5.1]\u000a      towards the development of the General Recommendation No. 27 on Older\u000a      Women [5.2].\u000a    This research, showing that the individual's employment history affects\u000a      income in later life, and that lower retirement income was linked with\u000a      fewer years of employment history, was also cited by the Australian\u000a      Government's key research body in the area of family wellbeing, the\u000a      Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS), in their 2012 report on `Ageing\u000a        parent carers of people with a disability' (5.3), and was used to\u000a      argue the need for a carers pension for Australia's 490,000 carers\u000a      providing unpaid assistance to others with a severe or profound level of\u000a      disability.\u000a    In 2009, CPC was a partner in a successful bid to the European Commission\u000a      to establish a knowledge exchange platform to promote understanding of\u000a      demographic change in Europe [5.4]. Since then, members of CPC\u000a      have actively participated in a series of public engagement events\u000a      organised by Population Europe (a network of leading European\u000a      research centres supported by the European Commission) giving\u000a      presentations at meetings between influential decision-makers and eminent\u000a      scholars [5.5]. For example, in October 2010 Falkingham gave a\u000a      keynote address at a closed meeting for members of the European\u000a      Parliament, the Chair of the European Economic and Social Committee and\u000a      the Head of Social and Demographic Analysis for the Directorate-General\u000a      (DG) for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. This led in January\u000a      2011 to the `Population &amp; Policy Compact' Europe's Citizens should\u000a        have a Choice: Toward a New Policy of Life-Course Flexibility' [5.6]\u000a      co-authored by Falkingham and advocating the adoption of policies to\u000a      support more flexible work and better work-life balance. This was\u000a      supplemented in September 2011 with the `Demographic Insights' paper Working\u000a        Life &amp; Retirement - a short briefing for the media based on an\u000a      interview with Jane Falkingham [5.6]. In May 2012, Falkingham gave\u000a      the opening address at a Population Europe Conference held at the\u000a      Presidential Palace, Warsaw, attended by the President and the Polish\u000a      Minister of Social Protection [5.5]. Funding for Population Europe\u000a      from the EC has since been renewed, with Jane Falkingham forming part of\u000a      the four person bid drafting team (along with French, Dutch and German\u000a      colleagues) for both grants.\u000a    The weight of the impact of CPC's ongoing research in informing policy\u000a      debate at the European level is corroborated by Ettore Marchetti, of the\u000a      DG for Employment:\u000a    'Jane's team has helped us highlight the importance of adapting social\u000a        policy to take account of recent demographic changes, particularly the\u000a        changing shape of the life course across cohorts as well as gender\u000a        inequalities. This type of research is important in supporting the\u000a        European Commission, the Member States as well as their social partners\u000a        meet the challenge of an ageing population and promoting solidarity\u000a        between generations.'

A subsequent e-mail from Alexandre Sidorenko, former head\u000a      of UN Ageing programme and conference organiser, said:\u000a    `... the Centre for Research on Ageing has provided valuable insights\u000a        into the changing shape of the life course and the critical role played\u000a        by both the family and social policy in ensuring quality of life in old\u000a        age. Prof Falkingham's recent keynote address ... highlighted the\u000a        importance of social policy adapting to a changing life course and the\u000a        necessity of designing social policy that delivers across the life\u000a        course. Her recommendations were reflected in the subsequent Research\u000a        Forum's Statement presented during the Ministerial Conference.'

Increasing longevity, changes in patterns of\u000a      family formation, family dissolution and labour force participation are\u000a      altering the shape of the life course. This has implications for all areas\u000a      of social policy, but especially those concerned with promoting work-life\u000a      balance and supporting family care. Jane Falkingham, Professor of\u000a      Demography &amp; International Social Policy (since 2002) and Director of\u000a      the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Centre for Population\u000a      Change (CPC) (since 2009), and Maria Evandrou, Professor of Gerontology\u000a      and founding Director of the Centre for Research on Ageing (CRA) (since\u000a      2005), and their teams at the University of Southampton have conducted\u000a      research towards improving our understanding of the social policy\u000a      implications of population ageing in the UK and internationally. In\u000a      particular, this research has evidenced a) the importance of the life\u000a      course in determining outcomes in later life and b) the pressing need to\u000a      adapt social policy to the changes in the life course that are taking\u000a      place across cohorts. The team's research has also focussed attention on\u000a      the need to take into account gender differences in the life course and\u000a      their associated inequalities.\u000a    In two linked papers, published in the Journal of Social Policy [3.1]\u000a      and the Journal of European Social Policy [3.2], Evandrou and\u000a      Falkingham, with their co-authors Tom Sefton (Research Fellow employed on\u000a      the Nuffield Foundation grant 2005-2007 [G1]; now working outside\u000a      academia) and Athina Vlachantoni (Senior Lecturer in Gerontology,\u000a      University of Southampton), provided empirical evidence of the\u000a      relationship between the family and work histories of older women and\u000a      their personal incomes in later life, in the UK, Germany and Sweden.\u000a      Comparison of three countries with different welfare regimes and pension\u000a      systems facilitated improved understanding of the interaction between the\u000a      life course, pension system and women's incomes in later life. The\u000a      research also highlighted the trade-offs in policy design between two\u000a      objectives: rewarding work, and protecting the most vulnerable, such as\u000a      carers, long-term disabled and unemployed.\u000a    A body of work by Evandrou and Falkingham over the last decade has\u000a      investigated changes in the demographic and socio-economic experiences\u000a      across cohorts, drawing attention to the fact that the characteristics and\u000a      needs of tomorrow's elders were likely to be very different to those of\u000a      today's older population. For example, empirical analysis underlined the\u000a      significant diversity amongst the 1960s baby boomers in terms of their\u000a      patterns of family formation and dissolution, alerting policy planners to\u000a      a likely `informal care gap' [3.3, G2].\u000a    From 2010 this line of enquiry was extended to investigate patterns of\u000a      living arrangements across the life course. Research on changes in the\u000a      living arrangements of young men and women over the past 20 years\u000a      highlighted the role that social policies play in influencing the ability\u000a      of young adults' to maintain residential independence [3.4]. The\u000a      research team also explored the under- researched phase of mid-life using\u000a      data from the General Household Survey (1984-2007) and the British\u000a      Household Panel Survey to demonstrate that living alone in mid-life is on\u000a      the rise, with implications for care networks in later life [3.5,\u000a        3.6, G3].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43075","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As a direct result of their research, Matthews and Madise have advised\u000d\u000a      leading national and international policy makers throughout the impact\u000d\u000a      assessment period, with their findings informing policy development on\u000d\u000a      maternal and child health in developing countries.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, the WHO's World Health Report of which Matthews was one of four\u000d\u000a      main authors &#8212; and which remains the most comprehensive document of its\u000d\u000a      kind &#8212; was disseminated to the House of Commons International Development\u000d\u000a      Committee. The findings from this report on maternal health skilled\u000d\u000a      providers, alongside several other research outputs by Matthews et al.\u000d\u000a      were cited as written evidence in the Committee's report on Maternal\u000d\u000a      Health in February 2008 [5.1, 5.7]. Both Matthews and Madise act as\u000d\u000a      advisors regularly for DFID and other international agencies. For example,\u000d\u000a      in 2010 Madise and Matthews were invited to contribute to the development\u000d\u000a      of DFID's Strategy for Reproductive, Maternal, and Newborn Health (RMNH),\u000d\u000a      which is used in prioritising the nearly &#163;200 million funding in these\u000d\u000a      areas. The strategy document `Choices for women: Planned Pregnancies, Safe\u000d\u000a      Births and Healthy Newborns' uses evidence from the Atlas of Birth (see\u000d\u000a      details below) and papers by Matthews and Madise on urban health in the\u000d\u000a      rationale for investment [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Also in 2008, Matthews was commissioned by the Norwegian Prime Minister,\u000d\u000a      Jens Stoltenberg, to report on the progress of MDGs 4 and 5 on child and\u000d\u000a      maternal health. Her report was presented to the network of global\u000d\u000a      leaders, including Gordon Brown, Bill Gates, and the then World Bank\u000d\u000a      President Paul Zoellick, at a UN high level event in September 2008\u000d\u000a      leading to renewed focus on maternal and child health and a `Call to\u000d\u000a      Action' campaign led by Gordon Brown which asked for renewed global\u000d\u000a      commitments to accelerate progress of the two MDGs [5.3]. Matthews'\u000d\u000a      research input into the co-authored work, The State of the World's\u000d\u000a        Midwifery 2011: Delivering Health, Saving Lives [5.4], the\u000d\u000a      first global data collection of midwifery services from 68 resource-poor\u000d\u000a      countries, was presented in September 2011 at a UN special retreat on\u000d\u000a      women and children as part of the recommendations of UN Secretary-General\u000d\u000a      Ban Ki Moon's new Accountability Commission for the health of Women and\u000d\u000a      Children.\u000d\u000a    As a direct result of her research, Madise was invited to the United\u000d\u000a      Nations Expert Group organised by the UN Population Division in January\u000d\u000a      2008 to discuss lessons from her work on maternal and child health in\u000d\u000a      urban poor settings. The proceedings from this meeting were published and\u000d\u000a      disseminated to member states by the United Nations [5.5]. Also,\u000d\u000a      since 2005, Madise has been contacted to advise the William and Flora\u000d\u000a      Hewlett Foundation and the Packard Foundations on priority areas for\u000d\u000a      funding in the African continent. In 2012, she was approached by the Bill\u000d\u000a      and Melinda Gates Foundation to advise them on how to improve access to\u000d\u000a      reproductive health services among poor African women. Melinda Gates used\u000d\u000a      some of Madise' s research findings in her speech at the TedX event in\u000d\u000a      Berlin on 5th April 2012, which was attended by more than 300\u000d\u000a      people and broadcast online to millions worldwide [5.10].\u000d\u000a    The research cited in Section 3 has also contributed to raising public\u000d\u000a      awareness. In 2009 members of GHP3 were invited to collaborate with the\u000d\u000a      White Ribbon Alliance (an international coalition promoting health care\u000d\u000a      for women and newborns) to co-produce the global `Atlas of Birth', an\u000d\u000a      advocacy tool featuring powerfully communicated coloured maps. The Atlas\u000d\u000a      was disseminated globally in 2009\/10, including at the G8, Canadian\u000d\u000a      Parliamentarians' meeting, the African Union Summit, the International\u000d\u000a      Parliamentarians Annual meeting in Bangkok, and the `Women Deliver'\u000d\u000a      Conference. The Atlas of Birth is cited repeatedly in DFID's RMNH strategy\u000d\u000a      [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Madise et al's research on maternal health in urban poor settings in\u000d\u000a      Nairobi has had a direct impact in influencing service provision in the\u000d\u000a      slum communities where it was undertaken. Madise disseminated the results\u000d\u000a      of her research on maternal health among women in Nairobi slums to\u000d\u000a      District Medical Officers of Health (DMOH) in the Nairobi province and as\u000d\u000a      a direct result, the DMOH of Kasarani district in 2012 persuaded the\u000d\u000a      Government of Kenya to build two maternity facilities in one of the slums.\u000d\u000a      These facilities, expected to be opened in July 2013, will serve a\u000d\u000a      population of over 200,000 [5.8]. In addition, the DMOH's office\u000d\u000a      has reviewed the way they record the causes of maternal deaths as a direct\u000d\u000a      result of Madise et al's work.\u000d\u000a    Similarly, Matthews' framework for assessing the quality of care in\u000d\u000a      institutional settings in developing countries has been used in Nepal\u000d\u000a      where the Family Health Division in the Ministry of Health has developed\u000d\u000a      the `Monitoring of Quality of Care in Maternity Services' guidelines based\u000d\u000a      on the Southampton research and on the WHO Mother Baby Package. The\u000d\u000a      guidelines, which have been implemented in 14 health facilities, have\u000d\u000a      resulted in changes in hospital working modalities in maternity care and\u000d\u000a      improved the care for millions of pregnant women [5.6].\u000d\u000a    The research by GHP3 on maternal health has had significant impact on\u000d\u000a      policies of governments and international agencies, and indirectly led to\u000d\u000a      millions of women's and children's lives saved. With new funding, Matthews\u000d\u000a      and Madise are continuing to engage with research users to translate their\u000d\u000a      work into policies and actions (for example DFID funding mentioned in\u000d\u000a      Section 3 to work with governments in six African countries to improve\u000d\u000a      women's and children's health, and Wellcome Trust funding to engage with\u000d\u000a      Kenya Ministry of Health).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by the University of Southampton into maternal and child health\u000d\u000a      in the developing world has contributed significantly to the design of\u000d\u000a      better health policies by governments, international agencies, and\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations.

Every day, approximately 800\u000d\u000a      women worldwide die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and\u000d\u000a      childbirth. 99% of them live in developing countries, particularly\u000d\u000a      sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The majority of these women could be\u000d\u000a      saved with adequate reproductive health and maternity care. Similarly,\u000d\u000a      over 3 million newborns die needlessly every year. It is on these areas\u000d\u000a      that the Centre for Global Health, Population, Poverty, and Policy (GHP3)\u000d\u000a      at the University of Southampton and its predecessor, Opportunities\u000d\u000a        and Choices DFID Reproductive Health Knowledge Programme (1999-2005)\u000d\u000a      have focused much of their research. Over the past two decades, Zo&#235;\u000d\u000a      Matthews, Professor of Global Health and Co-Director of GHP3 (1993-), and\u000d\u000a      Nyovani Madise, Professor of Demography and Social Statistics (1993-) and\u000d\u000a      founding director of GHP3, and their teams have produced a number of high\u000d\u000a      quality research outputs on access to reproductive and maternal health\u000d\u000a      care and the quality of that care.\u000d\u000a    a) In a paper published in the Lancet [3.1], Matthews et al found\u000d\u000a      that the lack of skilled providers (doctors and midwives) was one of the\u000d\u000a      key barriers to stemming the tide of maternal and newborn deaths, and that\u000d\u000a      teams of midwives and midwife assistants working in facilities (as opposed\u000d\u000a      to solo health workers assisting with home deliveries) are the most\u000d\u000a      efficient option for increasing the availability of maternity care. This\u000d\u000a      work commenced while Matthews was on secondment to the World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation (WHO) in 2003-2005 where she carried out global policy\u000d\u000a      overviews on maternal and newborn health and survival through structured\u000d\u000a      literature reviews informed by medical and other health staff worldwide [3.2].\u000a      The results were reported in the World Health Report 2005. During her\u000d\u000a      secondment, Matthews retained her Reader position at Southampton where she\u000d\u000a      had access to research facilities and funding from the Opportunities and\u000d\u000a      Choices DFID-funded programme, to enable her to continue to work on\u000d\u000a      collaborative projects.\u000d\u000a    b) Madise and her collaborators at the African Population Health Research\u000d\u000a      Centre conducted pioneering empirical research among the urban poor in\u000d\u000a      Kenya and other Africa countries from 2004 to 2012 [3.3-3.4]. This\u000d\u000a      body of research, funded by the World Bank and the Wellcome Trust, showed\u000d\u000a      that the residents of urban informal settlements (or slums) often lack\u000d\u000a      access to formal health care despite their close physical proximity to\u000d\u000a      health services, challenging the notion that urban residents have better\u000d\u000a      health outcomes than their rural counterparts. In the Kenya study, slum\u000d\u000a      residents had as much as 25% higher maternal mortality than the national\u000d\u000a      rate and poorer child health outcomes than the national population.\u000d\u000a      Matthews, Madise, Dr Amos Channon (lecturer since 2008) and their\u000d\u000a      collaborators from UCL and Agha Khan University strengthened these\u000d\u000a      findings in 2010 through an analysis of data from 30 poor countries which\u000d\u000a      again showed that no urban `advantage' in health care and child survival\u000d\u000a      exists for poor people [3.5]. The work was published in leading\u000d\u000a      journals including PLoS Medicine, American Journal of Public Health,\u000d\u000a      Demography, and Social Science and Medicine.\u000d\u000a    c) Matthews et al, with funding from the Wellcome Trust, also conducted a\u000d\u000a      situation analysis of the quality of care within institutional maternity\u000d\u000a      services in a slum area in Mumbai in India, developing a framework [3.6]\u000d\u000a      which can be used as a flexible quality assessment tool in similar\u000d\u000a      settings in developing countries. Key findings included evidence that care\u000d\u000a      quality is far from optimal in either municipal or private facilities,\u000d\u000a      with quality issues including a lack of essential drugs, the use of\u000d\u000a      inappropriate procedures, and women being left unsupported, among others.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43076","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2403846","Name":"Sierra Leone"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"49518","Name":"Rwanda"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1873107","Name":"North Korea"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The long-term relationship between the University of Southampton and the\u000d\u000a      Chinese ministries has\u000d\u000a      enabled Southampton's research to make a significant impact on a) Chinese\u000d\u000a      health policies and\u000d\u000a      delivery of services; b) practitioners, professional services and health\u000d\u000a      systems; c) health and well-\u000d\u000a      being of Chinese men and women and (d) funding policies of international\u000d\u000a      donor agencies.\u000d\u000a    Impact on the Chinese government's reproductive health policies.\u000d\u000a    The Southampton-led evaluation of the UN pilot project in China\u000d\u000a      reinforced its credibility and\u000d\u000a      convinced the Chinese government to scale up, between 2008 and 2010, the\u000d\u000a      informed choices\u000d\u000a      model and roll it out across the country [5.1-5.2]. This policy\u000d\u000a      was implemented by China's National\u000d\u000a      Population and Family Planning Commission (NPFPC) and the Ministry of\u000d\u000a      Health (MoH). The\u000d\u000a      Deputy Director General of NPFPC wrote in 2013 that \"the research [from\u000d\u000a        Southampton] was\u000d\u000a        crucial in facilitating a high-level policy dialogue which eventually\u000d\u000a        led to expanding the informed\u000d\u000a        choices model of RH\/FP services at the national level ...In this\u000d\u000a        context, the contributions from\u000d\u000a        Southampton and CPDRC team have been exemplary and unique in not only\u000d\u000a        generating quality\u000d\u000a        scientific evidence but also taking a proactive role in influencing\u000d\u000a        policy dialogue and programme\u000d\u000a        interventions\" [5.1].\u000d\u000a    Administrative changes in the structure of the FP programme. The\u000d\u000a      Southampton research\u000d\u000a      highlighted the need to integrate RH\/FP services to improve efficiency and\u000d\u000a      quality of care. This\u000d\u000a      recommendation has had a significant impact on the decision to merge the\u000d\u000a      NPFPC and MoH into\u000d\u000a      the National Health and Family Planning Commission [5.2]. Brought\u000d\u000a      to effect in March 2013, one of\u000d\u000a      the key strategies of the newly formed ministry is to reduce the overlap\u000d\u000a      and improve efficiency in\u000d\u000a      RH\/FP service provision. The UNFPA Representative in China commented in a\u000d\u000a      letter in May 2013\u000d\u000a      that \"the logic and justification for integrating the two systems were\u000d\u000a        repeatedly stressed in the\u000d\u000a        recommendations of the independent research reports produced by the\u000d\u000a        University of Southampton\u000d\u000a        and team in China. We believe that the integration of the Family\u000d\u000a        Planning and the Health systems\u000d\u000a        will enhance client-centred services and ensure better quality of care\u000d\u000a        in delivering high quality\u000d\u000a        reproductive health services for men and women in China\" [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Impact on practice of service providers. Between 2008 and 2009,\u000d\u000a      the NPFPC and the MoH\u000d\u000a      revised the in-service training modules to include, for the first time,\u000d\u000a      gender-based RH\/FP\u000d\u000a      information, counselling, referral and treatment services for HIV\/AIDS and\u000d\u000a      other STDs. Acting on\u000d\u000a      recommendations made by the Southampton researchers, they amended\u000d\u000a      post-abortion care\u000d\u000a      guidelines to consider the individual RH\/FP needs of women and couples to\u000d\u000a      ensure better quality\u000d\u000a      service provision without coercion or discrimination [5.1-5.2].\u000d\u000a      Enhanced training for grassroots FP\u000d\u000a      service providers was instituted, so that they could more effectively\u000d\u000a      communicate with women and\u000d\u000a      couples. In a letter dated March 2013, the Deputy Director General of the\u000d\u000a      NPFPC confirms the\u000d\u000a      contribution of Southampton's research in changing protocols and staff\u000d\u000a      training as follows: \"...the\u000d\u000a        research enabled us to identify areas for further intervention, and\u000d\u000a        reviewing the protocols for\u000d\u000a        gender-oriented service standards, staff training at different levels,\u000d\u000a        referral services and treatment\u000d\u000a        compliance\" [5.1]. Similarly, Dr Arie Hoekman, in a letter\u000d\u000a      dated May 2013, states, \"We have been\u000d\u000a        reassured by the research generated by the University of Southampton\u000d\u000a        that expanding\u000d\u000a        contraceptive choices through client-friendly services can positively\u000d\u000a        influence individual\u000d\u000a        reproductive health\" [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Evidence collected by the research team in 2010 shows the benefit of this\u000d\u000a      improved practice and a\u000d\u000a      shift in attitudes among health providers. Compared to the earlier period\u000d\u000a      in 2003, birth quotas in\u000d\u000a      the 2010 evaluation had been removed in 85% of the counties studied and\u000d\u000a      induced abortions fell\u000d\u000a      by an average of 43% (and up to 60% in more economically developed\u000d\u000a      regions) [3.6]. Knowledge\u000d\u000a      of RH\/FP had increased among men and women (including awareness of\u000d\u000a      HIV\/AIDS and STD\u000d\u000a      transmission routes) [3.4, 3.6]. Contraceptive choice was enhanced\u000d\u000a      and more women and couples\u000d\u000a      were making family planning decisions without being influenced by health\u000d\u000a      providers [3.4, 3.6, 5.1,\u000d\u000a        5.2].\u000d\u000a    Impact on health and wellbeing of individuals. The extension of\u000d\u000a      the UN programme nation-wide,\u000d\u000a      which was a direct result of the findings from the Southampton-led\u000d\u000a      research, has meant that\u000d\u000a      754 million Chinese men and women of reproductive age (15-49) now have\u000d\u000a      access to family\u000d\u000a      planning methods of their choice without coercion or discrimination from\u000d\u000a      service providers. The\u000d\u000a      policy changes, implemented by Chinese government ministries, have\u000d\u000a      improved the quality of life\u000d\u000a      of millions of Chinese men and women in 30 different provinces. Their\u000d\u000a      cumulative impact at\u000d\u000a      population level is captured in the findings of the UNFPA China Sixth\u000d\u000a        Country Programme (2006-2010)\u000d\u000a        Quantitative Evaluation Report published in December\u000d\u000a      2011 (see 3.4). The evaluation also\u000d\u000a      found that changes to the UN programme, as suggested by researchers'\u000d\u000a      earlier recommendations,\u000d\u000a      led to \"a significant improvement in the overall quality of care in RH\u000d\u000a        services over the intervention\u000d\u000a        period\" and \"significant progress in client-centred quality FP service\u000d\u000a        delivery.\" The evaluation also\u000d\u000a      discovered greater HIV\/STI knowledge and an increased number of\u000d\u000a      youth-friendly services.\u000d\u000a      Further recommendations from the earlier research to have a special focus\u000d\u000a      on young people,\u000d\u000a      gender and HIV prevention were adopted in the Sixth programme (2006-2010).\u000d\u000a    The shift towards client-centred RH\/FP services enabled, in particular,\u000d\u000a      young women and men to\u000d\u000a      access RH\/FP services, irrespective of age or marital status. Evidence of\u000d\u000a      the impact at population\u000d\u000a      level was seen from the Sixth programme (2006-2010) evaluation report,\u000d\u000a      where rates of reported\u000d\u000a      condom use among young married adults more than doubled and induced\u000d\u000a      abortion rates fell\u000d\u000a      significantly [3.4, 3.6].

The\u000d\u000a      Southampton-led evaluation of\u000d\u000a      the earlier UN programmes gave the UN the credibility it required to\u000d\u000a      reassure 10 European\u000d\u000a      countries and Australia of the programme's effectiveness and led to the\u000d\u000a      continuation of\u000d\u000a      international funding for its work in China to the present date [5.2].\u000d\u000a      The UNFPA Representative in\u000d\u000a      China, Dr Arie Hoekman, wrote in May 2013, \"the research [led by the\u000d\u000a        Southampton team]\u000d\u000a        generated wider interest and facilitated a national level response\u000d\u000a        across China. In addition, the\u000d\u000a        donor countries and relevant stakeholders were convinced of the UN\u000d\u000a        programme impact in China\u000d\u000a        which led to subsequent funding of the Fifth and Sixth cycles of the\u000d\u000a        country programme\" [5.2]. The\u000d\u000a      validity of the results from three successive evaluation rounds,\u000d\u000a      underpinned by high quality data\u000d\u000a      and scientific publications in peer-reviewed international journals, was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in convincing\u000d\u000a      the Chinese government to scale up the programme nationwide, using an\u000d\u000a      informed choices model\u000d\u000a      [5.1].\u000d\u000a    The research has had an impact beyond China.

In 1979,\u000d\u000a      China introduced its family planning policy through which couples in urban\u000d\u000a      areas were restricted to\u000d\u000a      only one child, with some exemption for rural couples and ethnic\u000d\u000a      minorities.

Her emphasis on a child-centric approach to poverty\u000d\u000a        solutions and the importance of such an approach for CPAG was vindicated\u000d\u000a        when child poverty was taken within the ambit of the newly formed\u000d\u000a        Department for Children, Schools and Families.

Ridge developed some of\u000d\u000a      the first research to reveal the complex ways in which poverty affects\u000d\u000a      children's lives. Contrary to accepted academic and policy positions at\u000d\u000a      the time, which situated children as passive victims of poverty or used\u000d\u000a      adults as proxy informants about the impact of poverty in childhood, Ridge\u000d\u000a      presented children as active social agents, to provide new and innovative\u000d\u000a      child focused perspectives on poverty.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research includes the first UK study of child poverty\u000d\u000a      from a child-centred perspective (funded by ESRC) [3.1, 3.5, 3.6]. This\u000d\u000a      found that poverty and disadvantage permeated every aspect of children's\u000d\u000a      lives, from the economic and material to the social and emotional. A lack\u000d\u000a      of economic and material resources reduced children's opportunities\u000d\u000a      enjoyed by their peers; further processes of stigmatisation operated within\u000d\u000a      school [3.4,3.5]. Ridge showed that childhood is a formative social\u000d\u000a      experience, where the demands of participation and inclusion could be\u000d\u000a      considerable and the costs of exclusion particularly damaging. The effects\u000d\u000a      of such childhood poverty extend into adulthood.\u000d\u000a    The work advanced further, through a unique qualitative longitudinal\u000d\u000a      study of low-income work and family life. This consisted of 3 waves of\u000d\u000a      in-depth interviews with children aged 10-16 and their mothers [3.2, 3.3,\u000d\u000a      3.4]. Funded initially by ESRC, and then by DWP, this research explored\u000d\u000a      how lone mothers and their children negotiated the everyday challenges of\u000d\u000a      sustaining low-income work and family life. Children played a key role in\u000d\u000a      sustaining their mothers in work, taking on household chores, managing\u000d\u000a      their own and their siblings' care [3.7, 3.8]. This challenged accepted\u000d\u000a      notions of children as passive care burdens within working families.\u000d\u000a      However, in families where work was insecure and financially unrewarding,\u000d\u000a      this risked alienating children from the values of employment [3.9].\u000d\u000a    The research challenged accepted policy approaches for children, which\u000d\u000a      addressed children mainly as a future resource, a form of human capital to\u000d\u000a      be protected and developed. It challenged policy makers to take children's\u000d\u000a      needs and concerns seriously; it raised policy questions about what worked\u000d\u000a      best for low-income children at home, in school and in their\u000d\u000a      neighbourhoods; and it showed that children's own accounts could make an\u000d\u000a      essential contribution to understanding these processes.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 Ridge was commissioned by the DWP to conduct an expert review of\u000d\u000a      qualitative research with low-income children and their families to inform\u000d\u000a      the development of the Child Poverty Act and policy for children [3.10].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43249","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    [Numbers in square brackets refer to evidence in Section 5].\u000a    The impact refers to policy and practice aimed at helping lone parents\u000a      move into, and remain in, paid work. We have achieved impact by making our\u000a      research available in accessible and timely ways. The beneficiaries\u000a      include the policy community and the UK's two million lone-parent\u000a      families. In relation to the REF guidance (REF 01.2012, Main Panel C) we\u000a      identify three main types of impact.\u000a      1. `Influencing policy and practice leading to improved take-up or use\u000a          of services'. Our evaluation of the New Deal for Lone Parents and\u000a        our cross-national research on welfare to work programmes for lone\u000a        parents provided evidence that informed government decisions to extend\u000a        employment advice and support to more groups of lone parents, to deliver\u000a        that support through Personal Advisers, to provide `better-off'\u000a        calculations, and to introduce measures (such as benefits run-ons) to\u000a        ease the transition to work. Such measures were introduced into the New\u000a        Deal programme, following the evaluation, and hence were central to how\u000a        the New Deal operated. Millar was a special advisor to the House of\u000a        Commons Select Committee on employment targets, resulting in a 2007\u000a        report [reference 5.1] which led to measures to strengthen job retention\u000a        in the operation of the New Deal [5.2] implemented from 2008. Our\u000a          research thus had a direct impact on the delivery of the New Deal to a\u000a          substantial number of lone-parent families: between 2008 and 2011,\u000a          official DWP statistics [5.3] show that a total of about 440,000 lone\u000a          parents took up a place on the New Deal for Lone Parents programme.\u000a      2. `Policy debate has been stimulated or informed by research evidence\u000a          which may have led to the confirmation of policy, change in policy\u000a          direction, implementation or withdrawal of policy'. Our research\u000a        on lone-parent employment was used extensively by the Labour government\u000a        as confirmation of welfare-to-work policy for lone parents. This came\u000a        about through regular presentations to DWP (for example, Millar on\u000a        employment sustainability in 2008, Harkness on lone-parent employment\u000a        and mental health in 2009). Harkness' work is referenced in eight\u000a        government White Papers, including most recently in respect of universal\u000a        credit in 2012 [5.7].\u000a      Our cross-national research on tax credits is a specific example of\u000a        impact on policy implementation. Millar proposed and organised a seminar\u000a        funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and held at HM Treasury in 2002\u000a        with participants from across government and NGOs. The work was cited in\u000a        the HM Treasury paper [5.4] and influenced the design of the tax credits\u000a        that were implemented from 2003 onwards, with substantial revisions to\u000a        reporting requirements and the level of disregard in 2005\/2006, these\u000a        making the scheme operate more in line with our original proposals. Lord\u000a        Best (former Director of JRF) stated in his testimonial for our Queen's\u000a        Anniversary Prize entry (see below): this work `significantly informed\u000a        and influenced the measures .... The system of tax credits proved a very\u000a        important part of the reduction by some 600,000 in the number of\u000a        children living in poverty... The University of Bath can justifiably\u000a        take some credit for the raising of living standards for these\u000a        households.' [5.5]. In each year from 2007-08 to 2011-12 official\u000a          HMRC statistics [5.6] show about 1.2 million employed lone parents\u000a          have received tax credits, making a considerable difference to their\u000a          incomes and living standards.\u000a      3. `Influencing the work of NGOs or commercial organisations'. We\u000a        have worked closely with a range of NGOs, including key groups such as\u000a        Child Poverty Action Group, One Parent Families, One Parent Families\u000a        Scotland, Single Parent Action Network, Gingerbread and Gingerbread NI,\u000a        Women's Budget Group, the Smith Institute, and the Resolution\u000a        Foundation. Our research has helped NGOs to develop their responses to\u000a        government policy, to articulate policy alternatives, and to provide\u000a        advice and support on sustainable employment to lone parents.

Jane Millar\u000a      (Bath throughout), Susan Harkness (Bath since 2007) and Tess Ridge (Bath\u000a      since 2000) carried out the research. It also included joint projects with\u000a      colleagues who have now left Bath, in particular Karen Rowlingson (Bath,\u000a      1999 - 2006) and Martin Evans (Bath, 2002 - 2007), and others on specific\u000a      projects. Paul Gregg joined us in 2011, having already worked with Susan\u000a      Harkness at Bath, and this further consolidates this body of research. Our\u000a      work has been at the forefront of UK research into lone parenthood, work\u000a      and welfare, with significant grants (including from ESRC, JRF, and DWP)\u000a      and a substantial body of publications.\u000a    For many years lone-parent families in the UK have had low employment\u000a      rates and a high risk of poverty. Since the mid to late 1990s the focus of\u000a      UK policy has been to promote `work as welfare', with specific targets to\u000a      increase lone-parent employment and to reduce in-work poverty. Our\u000a      research in the REF impact period has explored both these topics in depth\u000a      and made a distinctive contribution to knowledge and policy development.\u000a    We have shown that the majority of lone mothers are highly motivated to\u000a      work and in general employment leads to better quality of life for both\u000a      mothers and children, including evidence of improvements in the mental\u000a      health of lone mothers, and improved self-esteem and other outcomes for\u000a      adolescents in lone-parent families [3.1]. However, our research has also\u000a      found that high rates of job exit among lone parents were a key factor in\u000a      limiting the ability of the Labour government to increase employment\u000a      rates. Our work showed that improving job retention rates, to levels\u000a      similar to those of other workers, would boost employment sufficiently to\u000a      meet the 70% lone parent employment target [3.2]. Our research following\u000a      lone mothers and children over time highlighted the role of the whole\u000a      family, including the children, in maintaining employment and underlined\u000a      the difficulty of `making work pay' in practice, with low pay and tax\u000a      credits often insufficient to establish income security [3.3].\u000a    Research at Bath has included also evaluation of specific government\u000a      policies. We were part of the team, with NatCen Social Research\u000a      (independent research contractor), that evaluated the New Deal for Lone\u000a      Parents (NDLP) prototype scheme and national programmes [3.4]. This\u000a      research highlighted the importance of the personal advisers providing\u000a      tailored and individual support. It also showed that the scheme worked\u000a      best for lone parents closest to the labour market, and least well for\u000a      those with multiple work disadvantages. These conclusions are reinforced\u000a      by our international comparative policy analysis of welfare-to-work policy\u000a      [3.5]. Finally, our work has shown the importance of wage supplements to\u000a      boost low wages and take working lone parents out of poverty. Our\u000a      cross-national study of tax credits was the only research to examine this\u000a      policy area design and delivery in detail and to provide evidence on the\u000a      trade-offs between simplicity, responsiveness to income change, and\u000a      administrative burden [3.6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43250","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    [Numbers in square brackets refer to evidence in Section 5].\u000a    The Imp-Act research between 1999 and 2005 has had a major impact\u000a      on policy and practice across the microfinance industry, notably in terms\u000a      of the ideas, frameworks and tools which the industry uses. This has had\u000a      significant consequences for millions of poor people globally.\u000a    \u000a      The research changed mind sets [5.5, penultimate paragraph;\u000a        5.8]. In particular, it was key to developing the idea of `double bottom\u000a        line' (i.e. social as well as financial) performance management of MFIs\u000a        &#8212; Copestake (2003) being the first published reference to the idea of\u000a        social performance in this field [3.3]. This in turn shifted the\u000a        emphasis away from ad hoc impact assessment studies controlled\u000a        and dominated by international donors, towards practices that MFIs\u000a        themselves could implement and benefit from directly.\u000a      The research had an immediate impact on how MFIs in Imp-Act\u000a        undertook social performance assessment and management: including\u000a        their design and use of tools for poverty assessment and social audit\u000a        [5.5, 5.6, 5.7]. An independent evaluation lauded the high quality of\u000a        the materials produced from the research, reporting that Imp-Act\u000a        was \"really entering new territories and was innovative\" and has\u000a        \"changed the industry\" [5.2, p55; 5.3].\u000a      The research played an \"effective role in setting the agenda of\u000a          the Social Performance Task Force\" [5.2, p55]. The SPTF is an\u000a        industry-wide body to which CGAP is affiliated, which in 2012 produced\u000a        the first \"Universal Standards for Social Performance Management\": a\u000a        joint policy statement for the sector by its leading actors.\u000a      Evidence of the growing adoption of social performance assessment,\u000a          beyond the MFIs who participated directly in Imp-Act,\u000a        comes from \"MIX\", the premier industry reporting body. By 2010, 405 MFIs\u000a        with 44 million borrowers (including banks) reported the use of social\u000a        performance management techniques [5.1]. The majority of their clients\u000a        were women, [5.2] with the median MFI reporting 29% of members below a\u000a        US$2 per day poverty line [5.1]. This adoption of social performance\u000a        assessment demonstrates a deeper commitment on the part of MFIs, to\u000a        align their financial services to their social mission and to meet\u000a          poor people's needs [5.1].\u000a    \u000a    This impact was achieved in three interconnected ways, involving\u000a      evidence, advocacy, persuasion and coalition-building.\u000a    First, from the outset the research was designed to be embedded within\u000a      the microfinance industry and to be `owned' by MFIs, as much as by the UK\u000a      academics coordinating Imp-Act, or the Ford Foundation funding it.\u000a      As the research diffused through the MFIs of the Imp-Act network,\u000a      they readily adopted the language, tools and practices that the research\u000a      promoted. This transmission was reinforced by the findings Copestake and\u000a      Johnson published in practitioner journals and industry-oriented outlets,\u000a      such as the Small Enterprise Development journal [3.5], and\u000a      through other leading microfinance research and support organisations.\u000a      Evidence for this is to be found in supporting statements from senior\u000a      staff of CARD in the Philippines [5.7], the Microfinance Centre (MFC) in\u000a      Warsaw [5.6], SEEP, SPTF and Microfinance Initiatives in Washington DC\u000a      [5.5, 5.8] and MicroSave [5.9].\u000a    Second, the Imp-Act research led to the formation of the Imp-Act\u000a        Consortium in 2006. This mainstreamed the uptake of social\u000a      performance management in microfinance through training and networking.\u000a      The Consortium drew heavily on Imp-Act research findings and\u000a      materials [5.1, 5.2]; therefore although not directly involved in the\u000a      training, Copestake and Johnson continued through their research findings\u000a      to have a significant impact on wider practice.\u000a    A key link resource was the Imp-Act Guidelines for social performance\u000a        management of microfinance, published in 2005 in French, Spanish and\u000a      Russian as well as English [5.4]. This included eight detailed Practice\u000a      Notes (http:\/\/www.imp-act.org\/resources\/publications\/practice-notes),\u000a      six of which were drafted primarily by Copestake or Johnson. The Imp-Act\u000a        Consortium subsequently incorporated all this material into A\u000a        Practice-Based Guide for Microfinance, aimed at \"putting the social\u000a      into performance management\". This is now available in five languages,\u000a      with over 100,000 downloads:\u000a      http:\/\/www.imp-act.org\/resources\/publications\/practice-guide.\u000a    Third, 2005 also saw the formation of the Social Performance Task Force\u000a      (SPTF). This was an initiative of the Ford Foundation, CGAP and the\u000a      Argidius Foundation, with the aim of mainstreaming the ideas and practices\u000a      of Imp-Act at the global policy level. By 2012, its membership had\u000a      grown to 700. As its coordinator, Laura Foose, comments: \"all of the\u000a        ideas, frameworks and tools that SPTF promotes can be traced back to the\u000a        Ford Foundation funded Imp-Act Programme that culminated in an\u000a        international conference on social performance in Bath in 2005 and the\u000a        book `Money with a Mission'. James Copestake and Susan Johnson both\u000a        played leading roles in the conception, implementation and influence of\u000a        the Imp-Act Programme and hence the idea of social performance\u000a        management in microfinance.\" [5.8]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Microfinance &#8212; financial services for people excluded from mainstream\u000a      banking &#8212; expanded rapidly during the 1990s into a global industry of\u000a      specialist microfinance institutions (MFIs) serving over 100 million\u000a      clients. The dominant view was that directly assessing achievement of\u000a      social goals, such as poverty reduction and women's empowerment, was an\u000a      unnecessary distraction from the commercial expansion of MFIs, needed to\u000a      reduce their financial dependence on aid. Our research successfully\u000a      challenged this view by demonstrating that MFIs could effectively monitor\u000a      their social as well as financial performance. The impact of this has been\u000a      an increase globally in the number of MFIs doing so, the development of\u000a      global standards for social performance assessment, and better quality\u000a      financial services for millions of relatively poor clients.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    University of Bath\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bath (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bath","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007850}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"756135","Name":"Warsaw"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1 J Copestake. 2007. `Mainstreaming Microfinance: Social Performance\u000a      Management or Mission Drift?'

The then dominant\u000a      view in CGAP was that MFIs should focus narrowly on commercialisation. The\u000a      Ford Foundation (a founding member) feared that this strategy was based on\u000a      weak evidence and unrealistic expectations about how far market-led growth\u000a      of microfinance services was delivering sustainable poverty reduction. In\u000a      1998, Ford approached Copestake and Johnson (then respectively Senior\u000a      Lecturer and Lecturer at Bath, and already known for their research on\u000a      microfinance impact), to help design a global action-research programme\u000a      into the effect of microfinance on poverty. It was agreed from the outset\u000a      that close collaboration with MFIs would be important for two reasons:\u000a      first, to document their capacity to build their own social performance\u000a      assessment systems; second, to improve prospects for mainstreaming\u000a      findings across the microfinance industry.\u000a    Improving the Impact of Microfinance on Poverty: an Action Research\u000a        Programme (Imp-Act) ran from 1999 until 2005. Copestake and\u000a      Johnson at Bath provided the main academic and strategic leadership of the\u000a      programme throughout this period, with academic and administrative inputs\u000a      also provided by staff at the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex\u000a      and Paul Mosley at Sheffield. Phase 1 comprised a global call to MFIs to\u000a      submit innovative ideas for social assessment; this led to 23 projects\u000a      being selected for Phase 2. These were conducted by MFIs varying in their\u000a      client base from a few thousand to nearly three million. Each MFI\u000a      implemented its own project, while a designated member of the UK academic\u000a      team provided technical support, documented the research process and\u000a      assisted with writing up. Copestake assumed responsibility for the six\u000a      MFIs in the Americas, and Johnson for four in Africa. Both also played a\u000a      pivotal role in overall research management, global synthesis and\u000a      dissemination (including leading industry workshops and conferences in\u000a      Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, USA and across Europe).\u000a    There were four key findings.\u000a    First, when prompted to assess their status systematically, many MFIs\u000a      found their clients to be less poor than they had assumed [3.1, 3.2, 3.4].\u000a    Second, net growth in numbers of clients using MFI services was shown to\u000a      be insufficient as evidence of positive impact on poverty, principally\u000a      because of high client turnover arising from taking loans without fully\u000a      understanding repayment terms, or underestimating their capacity to repay\u000a      [3.1, 3.2, 3.4].\u000a    Third, participating MFIs found systematic assessment of client\u000a      characteristics and experiences to be both feasible and operationally\u000a      useful (e.g. in improving products, services and targeting strategies)\u000a      [3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5].\u000a    Fourth, assessment of the social performance of MFIs did not necessarily\u000a      detract from their long-term business growth and profitability, because\u000a      raising client satisfaction and retention often enhanced MFI profitability\u000a      as well as social impact [3.4, 3.5].\u000a    These findings challenged the dominant view (including within CGAP) that\u000a      commercialisation and market competition alone would drive down poverty.\u000a      It also provided evidence to justify further investment in social\u000a      performance assessment.\u000a    The importance of assessing social performance alongside financial\u000a      performance was subsequently borne out by the 2008 US sub-prime crisis and\u000a      a series of similar crises in the microfinance sector itself. These crises\u000a      strengthened the uptake of Imp-Act tools and ideas, because they weakened\u000a      faith in the capacity of competitive markets populated by narrowly profit-\u000a      oriented agencies to deliver fair, inclusive and sustainable financial\u000a      services.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43251","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3439705","Name":"Uruguay"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    [Numbers in square brackets refer to evidence in Section 5].\u000d\u000a    Background: In 2005 the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco\u000d\u000a      Control (FCTC), the first global treaty developed under the auspices of\u000d\u000a      WHO, entered into force. Developed to address the global tobacco epidemic,\u000d\u000a      this is one of the most widely embraced treaties in UN history, with 176\u000d\u000a      WHO Member States now Parties to the treaty.\u000d\u000a    There was overwhelming evidence &#8212; including the research from the\u000d\u000a      University of Bath &#8212; that the TI had negatively influenced public health\u000d\u000a      policies in numerous jurisdictions. This prompted the inclusion, within\u000d\u000a      the FCTC, of Article 5.3, which specifically aims to reduce the influence\u000d\u000a      of TI on public policy, by stating that \"in setting and implementing their\u000d\u000a      public health policies .... Parties shall act to protect these policies\u000d\u000a      from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry\".\u000d\u000a    FCTC Articles are operationalised via Guidelines. The Article 5.3\u000d\u000a      Guidelines were to be agreed at the November 2008 Conference of the\u000d\u000a      Parties (COP) in Uruguay. The implementation of Article 5.3 was, however,\u000d\u000a      fraught with difficulty, given the power of the TI and its heavy lobbying\u000d\u000a      against this Article. The success of Article 5.3 would depend both on the\u000d\u000a      strength of these guidelines and on their subsequent implementation.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to impact: Gilmore and her colleagues achieved impact for\u000d\u000a      their research through their work with beneficiaries including WHO and\u000d\u000a      public health NGOs such as The Smokefree Partnership, Cancer Research UK\u000d\u000a      and Action on Smoking and Health (ASH). The diverse ways in which these\u000d\u000a      impacts were achieved included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      They press released the research, so as to secure widespread media\u000d\u000a        coverage in the UK and Europe; and when BAT wrote to the Guardian\u000d\u000a        to contest the research findings, they responded robustly, as did\u000d\u000a        Professors from the University of California San Francisco and the\u000d\u000a        University of Sydney [5.1].\u000d\u000a      They re-wrote the research findings in alternative formats, to ensure\u000d\u000a        they were accessible to a broad audience. These included (i) a series of\u000d\u000a        briefings given to interested journalists and high level European\u000d\u000a        Commission staff [5.2]; (ii) a report \"The Origin of EU\u000d\u000a            Better Regulation &#8212; the Disturbing Truth\", which synthesised\u000d\u000a        the research findings and their relevance for contemporary EU policy,\u000d\u000a        published online by the Smokefree Partnership; (iii) a section in the\u000d\u000a        highly influential European Environmental Agency report Late lessons\u000d\u000a          from early warnings [5.3].\u000d\u000a      They helped others to use the research. For example, ASH's 2010 report\u000d\u000a        A Smoke Filled Room was based on this research evidence (\"ASH\u000d\u000a          would like to acknowledge the invaluable contribution made to this\u000d\u000a          report by research led by the University of Bath\") and its 2011\u000d\u000a        report Tobacconomics stemmed from a conference workshop Gilmore\u000d\u000a        et al. arranged on their research [5.4].\u000d\u000a      They developed a novel knowledge exchange platform, www.TobaccoTactics.org,\u000d\u000a        to disseminate policy-relevant research findings. This has been\u000d\u000a        described as \"a unique resource for advocacy organisations.... I am\u000d\u000a          aware of more than one high profile media debate where exposure of\u000d\u000a          tobacco industry links of a front organisation, thanks to evidence\u000d\u000a          provided by the TT wiki, has served to undermine industry arguments\u000d\u000a          against key tobacco control measures.\" [5.5]\u000a\u000d\u000a      They worked with NGOs to ensure the work was disseminated to &#8212; and\u000d\u000a        understood by &#8212; a large number of key stakeholders, notably civil\u000d\u000a        servants and politicians [5.4].\u000d\u000a      In the UK, Gilmore presented research to a House of Lords meeting\u000d\u000a        (2009) [5.5] and gave oral and written evidence to All Party\u000d\u000a        Parliamentary Group enquiries (2010, 2012) [5.4; 5.6] and\u000d\u000a        meetings (2011) [5.4].\u000d\u000a      Gilmore also presented and debated the findings at a series of events\u000d\u000a        in the European Parliament (2008, 2010), European Commission (2010) and\u000d\u000a        the European Health Forum at Gastein (\"the leading health policy event\u000d\u000a        in the EU\"), attended by high level policy makers including the European\u000d\u000a        Health Commissioner [5.2].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Impact: Securing strong Article 5.3 Guidelines and enabling their\u000d\u000a        implementation.\u000d\u000a      In relation to the REF guidance (REF 01.2012, Main Panel C) we identify\u000d\u000a      four main types of impact.\u000d\u000a    1.

Influencing or Shaping of Relevant Legislation\u000d\u000a    With this research having already informed the development of Article 5.3\u000d\u000a      of this global health treaty, Gilmore and her colleagues were well-placed\u000d\u000a      to influence the 5.3 Guidelines. In the build-up to the November 2008 WHO\u000d\u000a      Conference of the Parties, it became evident that the TI was using the\u000d\u000a      `Better Regulation' commitments it had secured to lobby against the\u000d\u000a      Article 5.3 Guidelines. Gilmore and colleagues prepared a confidential\u000d\u000a      policy briefing for members of the European Health Working Group, which\u000d\u000a      includes representatives of all EU Member States and was meeting to\u000d\u000a      finalise the European position on the Article 5.3 Guidelines. This\u000d\u000a      briefing, which summarised the research and its relevance to Article 5.3,\u000d\u000a      \"was instrumental in safeguarding enough support amongst European\u000d\u000a        countries for Strong Article 5.3 Guidelines, in turn ensuring that\u000d\u000a        strong guidelines were agreed at the November 2008 Conference of the\u000d\u000a        Parties.\". [5.2; 5.5]. The Public Health Advocacy Institute\u000d\u000a      stated online: \"Her work has contributed to policy changes in Germany,\u000d\u000a        Russia and the EU and she has brought the documents and knowledge of the\u000d\u000a        tobacco industry conduct to the attention of a large and diverse\u000d\u000a        audience.\" [5.7]\u000d\u000a    3. Forms of regulation have been influenced\u000d\u000a    The WHO Article 5.3 Guidelines for Implementation encourage Parties to\u000d\u000a      introduce a range of measures aimed at limiting tobacco company access to\u000d\u000a      policymaking, and increasing surveillance of tobacco industry efforts to\u000d\u000a      exploit their information advantage and influence policy. The research at\u000d\u000a      Bath was cited in the Guidelines [5.8] and contributed directly to\u000d\u000a      a WHO report specifically developed to assist Parties with implementing\u000d\u000a      the Guidelines. Gilmore was a member of the Committee of Experts whose\u000d\u000a      meeting led to this report, which cites nine of her papers [5.9].\u000d\u000a      The 2008 WHO Europe World No Tobacco Day Medal was given \"in\u000d\u000a        recognition of outstanding contribution to tobacco control\" [5.10].\u000d\u000a    4. Improved health and welfare outcomes globally\u000d\u000a    Strong Article 5.3 Guidelines have global benefits because they enable\u000d\u000a      all 176 Parties to the FCTC to protect their policies from TI influence.\u000d\u000a      Implementation of a strong Article 5.3 has also increased the likelihood\u000d\u000a      of effective public health policies at UK and EU levels and the curbing of\u000d\u000a      TI intrusion. Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable mortality\u000d\u000a      globally accounting for almost 6 million deaths annually; a figure\u000d\u000a      predicted to increase to over 8 million by 2030 if current trends\u000d\u000a      continue. The potential for health gain is therefore very significant.\u000d\u000a      Gilmore received the 2009 Public Health Advocacy Institute International\u000d\u000a      Award for Outstanding Use of Tobacco Industry Documents: this was \"presented\u000a        in recognition of your significant contribution to public health ... to\u000d\u000a        improve the health of people around the world.\" [5.7]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Bath has undertaken extensive research on the conduct\u000d\u000a      of the tobacco industry (TI) and its influence over public policies.\u000d\u000a    This research has (a) significantly extended understanding of TI\u000d\u000a      influence, by showing that the TI not only attempts to influence public\u000d\u000a      health policies, but also enjoys significant influence over upstream\u000d\u000a      policies; (b) provided some of the best documented examples of corporate\u000d\u000a      influence over EU policy-making, raising concerns about transparency in\u000d\u000a      policy-making; and (c) increased awareness that regulatory reforms known\u000d\u000a      as Better Regulation may pose a threat to public health.\u000d\u000a    The key impact of this research, from 2008, is that it has reduced the\u000d\u000a      ability of the TI to influence public health policy.

This case study is concerned with research that exposes\u000d\u000a      the political strategies of the TI for influencing European Union (EU)\u000d\u000a      policies and then, beyond those, for limiting efforts at global tobacco\u000d\u000a      control through the WHO.\u000d\u000a    The research was based largely on analysis of internal tobacco industry\u000d\u000a      documents released via litigation, along with stakeholder interviews. It\u000d\u000a      showed that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The TI had sought to influence the EU's regulatory infrastructure: in\u000d\u000a        particular:\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        In the mid-1990s, British American Tobacco (BAT, the world's second\u000d\u000a          largest tobacco company), joined with other large corporations to\u000d\u000a          campaign for regulatory reforms in Europe. One aim was to ensure that\u000d\u000a          corporations would be consulted early in the EU policy-making process.\u000d\u000a          The second was to secure changes to the EU Treaty, specifying that\u000d\u000a          policymakers must minimise the impact of legislative developments on\u000d\u000a          businesses. [3.2]\u000a\u000d\u000a        Within 18 months, BAT and its allies had secured such changes to the\u000d\u000a          EU Treaty. These mandated a form of economic impact assessment that\u000d\u000a          involves early consultation with stakeholders; changes which later\u000d\u000a          became known as Better Regulation. They can serve to favour corporate\u000d\u000a          interests and embed industry participation in EU policymaking. \u000d\u000a            [3.2, 3.3]\u000a\u000d\u000a        The use of front groups, including the highly respected think tank,\u000d\u000a          the European Policy Centre, played a key part in BAT's success,\u000d\u000a          ensuring that even the most knowledgeable European civil servants were\u000d\u000a          unaware of the tobacco industry's involvement. [3.5]\u000a\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a      The TI used the changes secured at EU level in efforts to undermine\u000d\u000a        the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and\u000d\u000a        specifically FCTC Article 5.3, which aimed to limit TI access to policy\u000d\u000a        making [3.4]\u000a\u000d\u000a      Simultaneous with its attempts to influence upstream policies, the TI\u000d\u000a        was actively attempting to undermine developments in EU tobacco control\u000d\u000a        [3.1]. These included efforts to `block, amend or delay' a\u000d\u000a        proposed tobacco control directive. The use of misleading legal, trade\u000d\u000a        and economic arguments played a key part in industry efforts.

Here we\u000a      focus on the impacts attributable to our work within EEP.\u000a    The first impact is the EEP programme itself. The EEP programme is a\u000a      flagship programme for the Governments of Bangladesh and the UK\u000a      (represented via DFID, Bangladesh), and represents a major policy shift in\u000a      the international development landscape of Bangladesh. Bath's research\u000a      expertise was central to the successful proposal which guided the design\u000a      of the flagship programme, and has thereby impacted key governmental\u000a      policy decisions [5.1].\u000a    Second, our research has embedded the discourse of extreme poverty within\u000a      the Bangladesh polity and directly influenced the establishment of a new\u000a      institutional focus for extreme poverty. In 2009, Devine and Wood authored\u000a      an EEP paper which was used as a keynote presentation at an international\u000a      conference in Dhaka (see reference 3.1). The conference was widely\u000a      reported in the national press and attended by leading academics,\u000a      politicians including Ministers and the Speaker of the House of\u000a      Parliament. On the basis of this, Devine and Wood were invited to deliver\u000a      `expert workshops' on extreme poverty to the country's parliamentarians.\u000a      Five workshops were organised and over 150 parliamentarians, again\u000a      including Ministers, attended. This led directly to the establishment in\u000a      2010 of the country's first All Parliamentary Group on Extreme Poverty.\u000a      The formation of the group represents a major institutional change at the\u000a      highest levels of government in Bangladesh. According to the Speaker of\u000a      the House \"the formation of the All Party Parliamentary Group on\u000a        Extreme Poverty[...]is a major political development in Bangladesh. Not\u000a        only will it foster cross-party support for extreme poverty programmes\u000a        but will also promote a wider discussion in society about the need to\u000a        care more for those in greatest need. Colleagues at the University of\u000a        Bath have played a central role in supporting the formation of the Group\u000a        and building the capacity of its members\" [5.2]\u000a    Third, Bath's research has had a direct impact on the capacity\u000a      development of the 35 partner NGOs working in the EEP programme. During\u000a      EEP's inception phase (2008-2009), Devine and Wood supported partner NGOs\u000a      in devising new projects for extreme poor households, as well as tools for\u000a      targeting, monitoring and evaluation. They also influenced the overall\u000a      design of projects supported by EEP's innovation fund. For EEP NGO\u000a      partners, to work with the extreme poor was a new challenge and required\u000a      them to develop more suitable approaches. Commenting on the role of Devine\u000a      in this, one NGO leader states: \"with the EEP programme, I believe we\u000a        have the strongest lesson learning team we have ever had, and the\u000a        support and direct supervision you have given to staff has been central\u000a        in building up that team. Having greater capacity in lesson learning has\u000a        already brought benefits - we carry out our programme better, we have\u000a        improved the effectiveness of the organisation and we have attracted the\u000a        interest of new potential donors\". [5.3]\u000a    The fourth impact refers to livelihood improvements among the extreme\u000a      poor. The EEP programme has far exceeded its targets in terms of numbers\u000a      of direct beneficiary households, with the number recruited exceeding\u000a      248,000 against a target of 150,000 [5.4]. Independent baseline survey\u000a      analysis [5.5.] verifies that beneficiary households belong to the bottom\u000a      2-3% of the country's poor. Given that beneficiaries had no prior\u000a      experience of NGO involvement and that NGOs had no experience of working\u000a      with the extreme poor, this represents a major and radical achievement in\u000a      policy terms. In 2010, Andrew Mitchell, then UK Secretary of State for\u000a      International Development, visited the programme and is quoted as saying:\u000a      \"I've seen credible data that 74% of beneficiaries on one of the Shiree\u000a        projects has managed to lift themselves off the bottom, and now have a\u000a        chance of a better life ...It's wonderful that British aid is lifting\u000a        the poorest of the poor on to the ladder of economic opportunity\".\u000a      The data he refers to comes from the lesson learning\/monitoring and\u000a      evaluation activities of the programme overseen by Devine and Wood [5.1].\u000a    Fifth, EEP research has influenced policy decisions at local levels in\u000a      Bangladesh. One of the EEP partners, an NGO called NETZ, carried out\u000a      research supervised by Devine and Wood into indigenous community access to\u000a      government safety nets. The findings of the research were used to develop\u000a      an integrated advocacy campaign which consisted of a) lobbying policy\u000a      officers in local areas where indigenous communities resided; b)\u000a      organising a national workshop (in which Devine participated as a keynote\u000a      speaker) to stimulate a wider debate in society and put pressure on\u000a      national policy makers; and c) hosting an international conference in\u000a      Berlin and Brussels (in which representatives from the EU parliament, the\u000a      UN as well as the German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development\u000a      participated) to secure high-level external support.\u000a    The advocacy campaign resulted in notable and tangible benefits for\u000a      indigenous communities. Before the research and advocacy, only 2.65% of\u000a      NETZ's beneficiaries had access to government safety nets. At the end of\u000a      the campaign, this figure had risen to 10%. The NETZ Executive Director\u000a      concluded: \"Our research was important to help us plot out an advocacy\u000a        strategy with local communities and government officials at national and\u000a        international levels. Joe's supervision of the original research and his\u000a        support in the analysis of the data ensured we had strong and convincing\u000a        evidence to lobby policy makers. His participation at the national\u000a        workshop was also very important\" [5.6]\u000a    Sixth, our engagement with the EEP programme has further enhanced our\u000a      expertise on poverty dynamics in Bangladesh. Save the Children is one of\u000a      the NGO partners in the EEP programme and in 2012, asked Devine and Wood\u000a      to help develop a global `signature programme' in Bangladesh. Devine and\u000a      Wood prepared concepts notes and facilitated two international workshops\u000a      in May 20-12 and December 2012. According to the Regional Food Security\u000a      &amp; Livelihoods Advisor for Save the Children, \"Both Geof and Joe\u000a        had supported our successful EEP programme and we asked them to help us\u000a        build on this to develop the signature programme. Joe and Geof brought\u000a        invaluable insights, expertise and knowledge of poverty in Bangladesh to\u000a        the workshops, and this directly influenced the strategy Save the\u000a        Children adopted to achieve the ambitious scale of the signature\u000a        programme\" [5.7]. Further evidence of enhanced reputation is given\u000a      in Devine and Wood's work (2012-2014) for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign\u000a      Affairs. Following a peer reviewed international competition. Bath (Devine\u000a      as PI) was awarded a 659,000 euros research grant to assess the\u000a      effectiveness of the government's framework for development cooperation in\u000a      Bangladesh. The successful proposal, authored by Devine, was written\u000a      substantially around the expertise gained through our EEP work (5.8).\u000a    Finally, the EEP has directly benefited the reputation of the University\u000a      of Bath as a centre of excellence in poverty studies. Devine's research in\u000a      Bangladesh was selected, following a peer review process, as a showcase\u000a      for a Set-Squared Partnership event which sought to highlight \"research\u000a        programmes that have genuinely changed the world for the better\".\u000a      Devine's work was one of the 25 highlighted cases from across the\u000a      sciences, one of the very few from the social sciences, and is used to\u000a      illustrate the contribution university research can make to society [5.9].\u000a      Furthermore our research and policy engagement was recognised in the 2011\u000a      Diamond Jubilee round of the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Further and\u000a      Higher Education [5.10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In Bangladesh, 50 million people live in poverty and around 28 million\u000a      live in extreme poverty.

Building on years of poverty research in Bangladesh,\u000a      researchers at the University of Bath have played a key role designing and\u000a      then developing a &#163;65 million programme, which is the country's first\u000a      national scale initiative focusing exclusively on extreme poverty. Impacts\u000a      from the programme include improving the livelihoods of one million\u000a      extreme poor people; helping NGOs design innovative programmes for the\u000a      extreme poor; and embedding the discourse around extreme poverty in the\u000a      polity.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Bath\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bath (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bath","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007850}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2950159","Name":"Berlin"},{"GeoNamesId":"1185241","Name":"Dhaka"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1 Devine, J and Wood, GD.

One of the innovative\u000a      features of our research has been the focus on the social, political and\u000a      cultural dimensions of poverty which cannot be separated from their more\u000a      quantifiable and material aspects. Key contributions include work by Wood\u000a      and Gough (until their retirement) on welfare regimes in developing\u000a      countries [3.5]; and by McGregor, White and Devine (since 1987),\u000a      incorporating subjective indicators into more conventional poverty\u000a      analysis [3.4; 3.3], through an ESRC &#163;3.5 million research programme.\u000a      Devine and White subsequently won an ESRC\/DFID grant of &#163;240K to develop a\u000a      wellbeing assessment tool, and advance an understanding of wellbeing and\u000a      poverty in which religion, as an expression of culture, plays a key role\u000a      [3.3]. Through our research, we have been able to make significant and\u000a      unique contributions to the understanding of poverty dynamics in\u000a      Bangladesh, help shape policy agendas around poverty, and support\u000a      organisations implementing development projects.\u000a    In 2007, DFID announced it would establish a national level programme in\u000a      Bangladesh which would focus exclusively on the needs of the extreme poor.\u000a      This was to be a flagship programme for DFID, in that it signalled a\u000a      deliberate policy shift in favour of the extreme poor, who had been\u000a      generally overlooked by conventional development programmes. In response\u000a      to DFID's open call for proposals, Devine from the University of Bath\u000a      co-authored and co-designed a &#163;65 million challenge fund programme, which\u000a      was selected after an international peer reviewed and competitive process.\u000a      The programme, entitled the Economic Empowerment of the Poorest\u000a      (EEP), runs from 2008 till 2015. It consists predominantly of direct\u000a      livelihoods interventions carried out by NGOs in Bangladesh, but also\u000a      supports research, lesson learning and advocacy activities. The overall\u000a      aim of the programme is to help one million people lift themselves out of\u000a      extreme poverty.\u000a    Bath's engagement with the EEP programme has had two related phases.\u000a      Between 2008 and 2009, Devine and Wood helped select partner NGOs, design\u000a      projects appropriate for the extreme poor, and develop systems to monitor\u000a      and evaluate lessons from the interventions. From 2010, Devine and Wood\u000a      led on the development of the EPP programme's research, lesson learning\u000a      and advocacy activities. The core of Bath's contribution to these\u000a      activities consists of a) a socio-economic and anthropometric survey; b)\u000a      an innovative life-history method which tracks households along six\u000a      wellbeing categories; and c) participatory case studies. The EEP programme\u000a      now has the largest single dataset, with national coverage, on extreme\u000a      poverty in Bangladesh. This allows for comparative and longitudinal\u000a      analysis, and also incorporates a highly innovative `real-time' tool\u000a      allowing self-assessment of change (http:\/\/www.shiree.org\/extreme-poverty-monitor\/).\u000a    The EEP programme significantly advances the poverty reduction agenda in\u000a      Bangladesh, and makes a distinctive contribution to knowledge and policy\u000a      development around extreme poverty. Here we highlight its headline\u000a      lessons. First, the experience of extreme poverty is qualitatively\u000a      distinct from other forms of poverty [3.2] and is characterised by chronic\u000a      insecurity [3.5; 3.6], intergenerational transmissions of disadvantage\u000a      [3.1], and hostile political economy conditions [3.1; 3.4]. Second, given\u000a      that extreme poverty is a qualitatively distinct experience, it requires\u000a      distinct policy responses from Government as well as NGOs and donors\u000a      [3.1]. Third, the programme demonstrates that it is possible to design and\u000a      deliver programmes which can significantly improve the livelihoods of the\u000a      extreme poor [3.1; 3.2]. However, sustaining these improvements in a\u000a      hostile political economy is a formidable challenge. This is evidenced in\u000a      research supported by Devine and Wood, and published as a series of\u000a      working papers (http:\/\/www.shiree.org\/research\/working-papers\/#.UQsD121yV1g).\u000a      To address the needs of the extreme poor will require, over time, a\u000a      fundamental shift and re-ordering of the wider political economy.

Audiences have\u000d      included public historians, urban historians, historians of technology,\u000d      postgraduate and undergraduate students, city planners, road safety\u000d      activists and journalists.\u000d    In September 2007 in Washington D.C. the Society for the History of\u000d      Technology (SHOT) hosted what may have been the first\u000d      historically-informed multidisciplinary workshop on death and serious\u000d      injury on the road. Prof Luckin gave a paper on the historical evolution\u000d      of the law in relation to alcoholic impairment among motorists and others\u000d      in mid-twentieth century Britain. The audience included road safety\u000d      activists as well as professional historians.\u000d    In April 2009 Luckin gave a talk at the School of Hygiene and Tropical\u000d      Medicine. Attended by academics, medics and nurses working in or training\u000d      for a range of roles in emergency medicine and NHS A and E services, the\u000d      paper deepened the Luckin's contacts with the academic drug dependency\u000d      community. This resulted in the publication, in 2010, of an article in Addiction\u000d      on anti-drink driving measures in twentieth century Britain.\u000d    In the same year, Prof Luckin chaired and commented on papers on\u000d      technologies of road safety at the Society for the History of Technology\u000d      annual conference in Pittsburgh. By this juncture, interest and numbers of\u000d      researchers involved in the topic had significantly increased. Partly as a\u000d      consequence, in April 2011 a stock-taking workshop was held at the Hagley\u000d      Museums, Wilmington, Delaware. Prof Luckin gave a paper that attempted to\u000d      make a provisional distinction between `accidents' and `natural\u000d      disasters'.\u000d    The most important outcome of the Hagley workshop was the creation of an\u000d      H-Net online bibliography to collate predominantly historical work on\u000d      risk, accidents and disasters. The tempo had now increased and in summer\u000d      2011, Dr Mike Esbester, then of Oxford Brookes University, organized a\u000d      symposium on the `History of Road Safety' at his institution. Prof Luckin\u000d      spoke on the problem of `Tracking the Silent Dead: Road Traffic Accidents\u000d      in the Twentieth Century'.\u000d    Luckin also contributed to an AHRC-supported workshop at the National\u000d      Railway Museum, York, organized by Profs Colin Divall and Colin Pooley.\u000d      The title of the project as a whole &#8212; `Mobility Cultures: Making a Usable\u000d      Past for Transport Policy' &#8212; provided an opportunity to interrogate\u000d      epistemologically highly complex relationships between the shaping of\u000d      contemporary transport policies and the `successes' and `missed\u000d      opportunities' of the past. Edited by Profs Divall and Pooley, a selection\u000d      of the York papers will be published in 2014 by Ashgate. Prof Luckin will\u000d      contribute an essay on the era of inaction that followed the passing of\u000d      Barbara Castle's path-breaking act in 1967.\u000d    Most recently, in September 2013, at another conference at Oxford Brookes\u000d      University, links between British, American and continental European\u000d      mobility scholars, transport planners and safety activists were further\u000d      strengthened. Papers focused on `Accidents and Emergencies: Risk, Welfare\u000d      and Safety in Europe and North America, c.1750-2000'. Emphasizing that the\u000d      time had come to begin excavating the deeper past, Luckin gave a keynote\u000d      address on `Drink Driving Before \"Drink Driving\" in Britain in the\u000d      Nineteenth Century'.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    A long established historian of disease and pollution in the nineteenth\u000d      century city, Bill Luckin is also an international figure in the history\u000d      of the `accidental' and the origins of the risk society.

This was taken up at the Centre for the History of\u000d      Science, Technology and Medicine at the University of Manchester, where he\u000d      has been an Associate for over 30 years. The project focused on the\u000d      massively neglected topic of road traffic accidents in twentieth century\u000d      Britain. The award was made at a time when the Wellcome Trust was seeking\u000d      to encourage scholars to engage with twentieth century subjects central to\u000d      a deeper public understanding of science, technology and medicine.\u000d    Luckin's four articles underline a movement from analysis of theoretical\u000d      frameworks relevant to historically-oriented issues in mobility studies to\u000d      in-depth engagement with drink driving between 1900 and the early twenty\u000d      first century. The final paper cited below, published in 2012, in the\u000d      multidisciplinary journal Transfers demonstrates the shift. By\u000d      this juncture, the author had veered away from the cultural and social\u000d      historical mainstreams and entered into closer contact with public\u000d      historians and mobility policy-makers. This involved exploring the\u000d      political, social and cultural contexts of earlier twentieth century\u000d      initiatives (and non-initiatives) designed fully to criminalize speeding\u000d      and dangerous and drink driving, thereby improving &#8212; a frequent phrase in\u000d      Luckin's work &#8212; the `social relations of mobility'.\u000d    The first chronologically cited paper, published in Cultural and\u000d        Social History and co-authored by the late David Sheen of the\u000d      University of Bolton, confronts theoretical and policy-related ambiguities\u000d      associated with the eclectic and sometimes grossly over-eclectic term,\u000d      `automobility'. The article identifies a `usable past' relevant to\u000d      historically-rooted debate over radical programmes to reduce the\u000d      overpowering dominance of the private car in the early twenty first\u000d      century developed and developing world. The paper also floats the\u000d      existence of a four-fold sub-periodization of Britain's twentieth century\u000d      movement towards mass motorization.\u000d    The second article, which appeared in Contemporary British History\u000d      in 2010, probes the repercussions of interwar departmental in-fighting on\u000d      developments in the latter part of the century and on into the 2000s. It\u000d      describes the curious failure of the Ministry of Transport (MoT) to secure\u000d      ownership of a massively destructive road traffic accident crisis, the\u000d      overriding departmental dogmatism of the Home Office and the unwillingness\u000d      of senior police officers to confront pro-motorism in the form of the\u000d      intensely influential AA and RAC.\u000d    The penultimate paper, published in Twentieth Century British History\u000d      in 2010, is more traditional. It seeks to correct the road safety record\u000d      and restore the reputation of the under-documented Conservative Transport\u000d      Minister, Ernest Marples. Appalled by the scale of the daily death-toll on\u000d      Britain's roads, the failure of the police and judiciary to prosecute and\u000d      punish speeding and dangerous driving, and the feebleness of British law\u000d      in relation to alcoholically impaired motorists, Marples transformed\u000d      himself into a safety progressive. He re-educated his senior officials who\u000d      then laid the foundations for Barbara Castle's path-breaking Road Safety\u000d      Act which passed into law in 1967. Luckin's forthcoming monograph takes\u000d      the narrative on into the present.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43403","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nature of the Impact: The PSSRU's pioneering projections models\u000a      for long-term care expenditure\u000a      have underpinned key quantitative analyses of social care funding\u000a      arrangements in both England\u000a      and at the European level for 15 years. Since 2008, the impact of the\u000a      Unit's work has been visible\u000a      in key documents produced by the UK Government and the EU. Research by the\u000a      Unit provided the\u000a      analytical modelling for the Labour Government's Green Paper on long-term\u000a      care funding [A,\u000a      pp.37,39,88,97], and for the subsequent White Paper on care and support\u000a      [B, pp. 45, 47, 48, 125,\u000a      131]. The Unit provided significant quantitative analytical support to the\u000a      Green and White Paper\u000a      teams, using purpose-built aggregate and dynamic micro-simulation models.\u000a      The unique nature of\u000a      the Unit's models have made it possible to explore the distributional and\u000a      longitudinal implications of\u000a      changes in the funding arrangements over the next 40 years. These models\u000a      have provided\u000a      Government with estimates of the impact of alternative funding systems on\u000a      the number of\u000a      individuals supported by the care system, the services consumed, the costs\u000a      to the state and to\u000a      private individuals, and levels of unmet need. The dynamic\u000a      micro-simulation model is unique in that\u000a      it generates estimates of the distribution of these key factors across\u000a      types of individuals (for\u000a      instance across need and wealth groups); it is also able to \"follow\"\u000a      individuals' interactions with the\u000a      care system as they age and hence to estimate the \"lifetime\" consequences\u000a      of different funding\u000a      systems on people with social care needs.\u000a    Fernandez acted as a specialist adviser to the House of Commons Health\u000a      Select Committee's\u000a      2010 review of Long Term Care Funding [C, p.11]. In the same year, the UK\u000a      Government set up\u000a      an Independent Commission, chaired by Sir Andrew Dilnot, in order to find\u000a      a fairer and more\u000a      sustainable way to pay for social care. The Commission's main report\u000a      explicitly stated the source\u000a      of its analysis to be the modelling work carried out by PSSRU [D,\u000a      especially p.12; E, especially\u000a      p.20]. Dilnot noted that the Commission `relied very heavily on the\u000a      work of the PSSRU in two\u000a      areas. The first was in helping us to frame the problem. The second was in\u000a      analysing our\u000a      suggested responses to it' [F]. Dilnot's main recommendation on the need\u000a      to develop a state-funded\u000a      insurance mechanism to protect individuals against the risk of\u000a      `catastrophic' social care\u000a      expenditures referred to the Unit's estimate that the lifetime social care\u000a      costs of approximately 10\u000a      per cent of 65 years olds in England would exceed &#163;100,000 [D, pp. 13,\u000a      32]. In addition the Dilnot\u000a      Commission was able to use the Unit's macro and micro-simulation models to\u000a      fine-tune its\u000a      proposals by modelling the costs and benefits of a wide range of changes\u000a      to the current means-tested\u000a      arrangements (e.g. assets thresholds and income tapers), and of\u000a      alternative levels of caps\u000a      on private lifetime costs [D, pp. 30-33].\u000a    The Department of Health (DH) accepted the analysis offered by Dilnot,\u000a      drawing further on the\u000a      Unit's macro and micro-simulation models to develop its plans for reform\u000a      in line with the main\u000a      recommendations of the Commission [G, p.30, p.32]. The DH has since issued\u000a      a policy statement\u000a      on care and support funding reform and announcing the implementation of a\u000a      &#163;75,000 cap on\u000a      private costs from April 2017 [H], based in part on the Unit's analyses.\u000a    The PSSRU is continuing to use the policy modelling tools it has\u000a      developed over the last 15 years\u000a      to support the DH in its analysis of social care funding reform and of\u000a      resource allocation in\u000a      England. Currently, the micro-simulation model is being used in a\u000a      DH-funded study that is\u000a      developing a resource allocation formula to distribute social care funds\u000a      to local authorities and,\u000a      after many years of discussions about alternative solutions for funding\u000a      long-term care, the Unit's\u000a      work is now poised to help bring about decisive movement towards\u000a      sustainable, more efficient and\u000a      fairer arrangements for distributing the cost of caring for dependent\u000a      people in England.\u000a    Thus the work of the Unit has had significant reach at national level. In\u000a      addition, the PSSRU has\u000a      produced a WHO briefing on funding options that fed into an EU Ministerial\u000a      Conference on the\u000a      Financial Sustainability of Health Systems [I]; this examined the key role\u000a      for the state in achieving a\u000a      fair and efficient social care funding system, and reviewed the range of\u000a      options adopted by\u000a      different countries, together with their associated costs and outcomes.\u000a    Wider Implications: Increasing numbers of people need long-term\u000a      care and ways are needed to\u000a      ensure that the funding arrangements are sustainable, more efficient and\u000a      the costs distributed\u000a      more fairly. The analysis carried out by the Unit has helped Government\u000a      identify and appraise the\u000a      priorities for funding reform, including the need to reduce the\u000a      significant risk of catastrophic expenditure\u000a      on care faced by a large number of dependent people. The on-going\u000a      implementation of a cap on care\u000a      costs in England will potentially improve the lives of millions of older\u000a      people at a particularly vulnerable\u000a      point in their lives, and achieve a fairer social care system in England.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Changes in key socio-economic patterns are threatening the sustainability\u000a      of the public social care\u000a      system.

The model produced the first\u000a      projections of future long-term\u000a      care expenditures for England based on a range of alternative assumptions\u000a      about present\u000a      and future demographic patterns, prevalence of disability, availability of\u000a      unpaid support, service\u000a      model and unit costs [Department of Health, &#163;581,074].\u000a    From that platform and as part of a project funded by EC DG Employment\u000a      and Social Affairs (grant\u000a      VS\/2001\/0270, &#163;36, 147], the methodology was adopted in order to make\u000a      projections for the UK,\u000a      Germany, Italy and Spain [3]. A version of the model was prepared for the\u000a      European Commission.\u000a      This took account of differences in data availability across the EU25\u000a      while maintaining a high level\u000a      of comparability, and enabled the policy implications of alternative\u000a      possible future scenarios to be\u000a      investigated [4]. In 2008, the Unit also developed a model exploring\u000a      future long-term care costs for\u000a      young people with physical disabilities and for people with learning\u000a      disabilities [5] [Department of\u000a      Health grant, &#163;25,700].\u000a    Since 2005, PSSRU has invested significant resources to develop a dynamic\u000a      micro-simulation\u000a      model of the health, social care and benefits systems in England. This\u000a      model was originally\u000a      developed to support the Wanless Social Care Review, which reported in\u000a      2006 [6, Kings Fund\u000a      grant, &#163;133,186]. The model enables analysis of a wider range of policy\u000a      questions than was\u000a      previously possible [7], and has since been used to provide the Department\u000a      of Health, the Treasury\u000a      and the Dilnot Commission on Funding of Care and Support with quantitative\u000a      estimates of the\u000a      aggregate and distributional impacts of alternative funding arrangements\u000a      on resource use, costs\u000a      and outcomes.\u000a    A technical paper [8]:\u000a    \u000a      described the methods and assumptions underlying the newly-developed\u000a        dynamic micro-\u000a        simulation model;\u000a      gave details of potential and actual users of care, their levels of\u000a        need, and their income and\u000a        assets;\u000a      detailed the system of support available, the current funding\u000a        arrangements and the benefits\u000a        system;\u000a      looked at costs and the degree to which population need was being met;\u000a        and\u000a      gave an assessment of the equity and efficiency of the current funding\u000a        system.\u000a    \u000a    Further analyses are ongoing: these are examining in greater detail key\u000a      issues for the future of\u000a      social care such as likely future patterns of the prevalence of disability\u000a      [9], availability of social care\u000a      workers in the future, and the role of private voluntary insurance in\u000a      long-term care [AXA grant,\u000a      &#163;142,236]. In addition, the micro-simulation model is being used to\u000a      support the development of a\u000a      new formula for the allocation of adult social care funding to English\u000a      local authorities [Department\u000a      of Health grant, &#163;80,567].\u000a    The Unit has recently prepared, in collaboration with the University of\u000a      East Anglia, an analysis of\u000a      the costs and distributional effects of reforms to the social care\u000a      financing system (including the\u000a      Government's reform proposals), and presented the analysis at a meeting of\u000a      the All Party\u000a      Parliamentary Group on Social Care [10].

But initially they sought to\u000a      simplify the old system. However their\u000a      new system was delayed and then failed to deliver. The Work and Pensions\u000a      Select Committee\u000a      published a series of reports. Bradshaw acted as Special Advisor on the\u000a      DWP Committee Report2\u000a      which concluded that the CSA \"a failing organisation which currently is in\u000a      crisis...consideration be\u000a      given to the option of winding up the Child Support Agency and plans made\u000a      for an alternative.\"\u000a    A new chief executive was appointed to the Child Support Agency and\u000a      undertook an urgent review\u000a      but his plans involved extra spending and little improvement. So the\u000a      Secretary of State announced\u000a      (Hansard 9 February 2006) that there would be a review by Sir David\u000a      Henshaw to completely\u000a      redesign the child support system, to report by the summer recess. Our\u000a      research contributed to the\u000a      Henshaw review3. The 2006 White Paper that followed also\u000a      referred to our work4. Between the\u000a      White Paper and the 2008 Act Bradshaw and Skinner were active in a series\u000a      of private, high level,\u000a      policy seminars involving key ministers (Lord Hunt, Lord Kirkwood).\u000a      Skinner presented a paper5 at\u000a      a Nuffield Foundation seminar. A paper6 presented by Bradshaw\u000a      at a seminar run jointly by The\u000a      Nuffield Foundation and One Parent Families was vital in influencing the\u000a      commissioning of the\u000a      international comparative study conducted at York (Skinner et al 2007) the\u000a      findings of which were\u000a      fed directly to the Director of the Child Support Division for the\u000a      operational redesign. There was a\u000a      consultation that referred directly to the results of our research7.\u000a    The White Paper led to the 2008 Act which abolished the CSA and returned\u000a      to private agreements;\u000a      the development of a new Child Maintenance Options service in 2008\u000a      offering holistic information\u000a      and advice services to all separated parents; and the introduction of new\u000a      `relationship support'\u000a      services under the 2012 Welfare Reform Act, which includes an online\u000a      one-stop-shop web\u000a      application `Sorting out Separation' designed by `the Family\u000a      Support Services Expert Steering\u000a      Group' 2013.\u000a    Child maintenance obligations are now recognised by policy makers as\u000a      being intimately interlinked\u000a      with family relationships; this has been the consistent message from our\u000a      research. The policy\u000a      changes from 2008-2013 affect all separated parents in the population (not\u000a      just CSA clients) and\u000a      consequently all of the dependent children who live with one non-widowed\u000a      lone parent, estimated\u000a      at 30% of all dependent children in the UK. The move to private agreements\u000a      and the delivery of\u000a      new support services under both Acts will have a vital impact on improving\u000a      parental relationships in\u000a      separated families and for increasing child well-being.\u000a    Skinner also acted as policy advisor to the House of Commons Work and\u000a      Pensions Committee\u000a      inquiry into Child Support Reforms (2007). Skinner, helped set the key\u000a      recommendations of the\u000a      enquiry, which included calling on the government to introduce holistic\u000a      support services dealing\u000a      with all aspects of parenting in separated families, not just child\u000a      maintenance obligations.\u000a      During 2008-2010 the insights on non-resident parents' child maintenance\u000a      behaviours gleaned\u000a      from Skinner's research on willingness to pay8 were delivered\u000a      directly to the first Chair of the Child\u000a      Maintenance Enforcement Commission (CMEC replaced the CSA) and the\u000a      Director of the Child\u000a      Support Division (2\/10\/2008). The findings from these studies were key in\u000a      developing Child\u000a      Maintenance Options in 2008 which offered holistic information and support\u000a      services to all\u000a      separating parents (not just CSA clients) to help them make private\u000a      agreements.\u000a      Skinner's research9 developed the evidence base further to help\u000a      policy makers understand how\u000a      more parents could be encouraged to make private agreements; i.e. through\u000a      a range of supportive\u000a      services that tackled separated family relationships and the practical and\u000a      emotional consequences\u000a      of relationship breakdown. It confirmed our earlier work at York showing\u000a      the vital importance of\u000a      parental and child relationships to willingness to pay. These insights\u000a      were incorporated into the\u000a      2012 Welfare Reform Act which focused upon encouraging co-parenting\u000a      relationships `first and\u000a      foremost' as the basis upon which child maintenance will then flow, rather\u000a      than the first approach\u000a      being to use ever stronger enforcement methods10 Following\u000a      that, the `Family Support Service\u000a      Expert Steering Group' involving Skinner as the sole social policy\u000a      academic developed a `2020\u000a      vision for new relationship support' services to help parents collaborate\u000a      in the upbringing of their\u000a      children (the first manifestation of service being the web application `Sorting\u000a        Out\u000a        Separation'). Taken together, our research has shifted the policy\u000a      rhetoric towards a more nuanced\u000a      understanding of parental behaviour which recognises the importance of\u000a      relationship factors to\u000a      willingness to pay11).\u000a    The 2012 scheme is still being piloted but we believe it is a much better\u000a      policy thanks partly to our\u000a      persistent research, scholarship and policy engagement since 1994.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at York undertaken by Bradshaw, Skinner, Corden and Davidson,\u000a      directly influenced\u000a      child support policy throughout the period 2008-2013, informing the\u000a      radical change that abolished\u000a      the Child Support Agency and returned child maintenance to the hands of\u000a      parents to make private\u000a      agreements under the `Child Maintenance and Other Payments' Act 2008.

The\u000a      Child Support Agency\u000a      (CSA) was established to force more separated parents (mainly fathers) to\u000a      pay child\u000a      maintenance. But it was set up with hardly any previous research on\u000a      non-resident fathers and\u000a      extremely limited understanding about their child maintenance attitudes\u000a      and behaviours. The\u000a      policy was strongly resisted and payment rates remained consistently low.\u000a      There was a long\u000a      hiatus in policy making while policy makers waited for the CSA to deliver.\u000a      Eventually the CSA\u000a      catastrophically failed. The insights from the research at York were\u000a      debated afresh throughout\u000a      the extensive review process leading to the radical 2008 Act. There were\u000a      four main studies:\u000a    1. The first ever national survey of 600 non-resident fathers in Britain\u000a      undertaken by Bradshaw\u000a      (1993-current Professor), Skinner (1995 Research Assistant, [1996-98 PhD\u000a      student], 1999-2000\u000a      Research Fellow, 2000-08 Lecturer, 2008-current Senior Lecturer), Stimson\u000a      (Research Fellow to\u000a      1998) and Williams (Research Fellow to 2010), 1995 - 1999. Funded by the\u000a      ESRC as a project in\u000a      the Population and Household Change Programme. The survey estimated the\u000a      population size of\u000a      non-resident fathers, described patterns of maintenance payments and\u000a      contact arrangements. It\u000a      demonstrated that fathers' financial obligations were entwined with their\u000a      social and emotional\u000a      bonds with children (and the other parent) and were fraught and complex.\u000a      What mattered most\u000a      were relationships, but fathers found it difficult to work out the `proper\u000a      thing to do' regarding child\u000a      maintenance. They needed a supportive policy, not ones that stigmatised\u000a      them as `feckless'. We\u000a      highlighted how child support policy was likely to fail as it was out of\u000a      line with fathers' sense of\u000a      fairness and the way child maintenance obligations operated in practice.\u000a    2. Bradshaw was commissioned by the JRF to review the potential\u000a      contribution of child support\u000a      to child poverty reduction as part of its 2006 programme What will it\u000a        take to end child poverty in\u000a        the UK? His research included comparative research on child support\u000a      policy in OECD countries\u000a      and the secondary analysis of the Family Resources Survey to model what a\u000a      child support\u000a      disregard would do to child poverty. Skinner and Meyer (2006) also\u000a      undertook similar secondary\u000a      analysis of the Family and Child Survey to assess whether child support\u000a      was helping lone\u000a      mothers.\u000a    3. Then the DWP commissioned us to conduct new comparative research to\u000a      feed directly into the\u000a      2008 Act. An international comparative study of child maintenance systems\u000a      across 14 countries\u000a      was conducted by Skinner, Bradshaw and Davidson (2005-2012 Research\u000a      Fellow) funded by the\u000a      Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). It extended the original 1999 work\u000a      done by Anne\u000a      Corden (1993-current Senior Research Fellow) in our Social Policy Research\u000a      Unit. The findings\u000a      confirmed private agreements were advantageous and that although\u000a      enforcement tools were\u000a      varied, compliance was difficult to achieve this way.\u000a    4. Then two other research projects commissioned by government related to\u000a      the post\u000a      implementation phase of the 2008 Act and the development of the 2012 Act.\u000a      Both involved the\u000a      collaboration of Skinner as research consultant to advise on research\u000a      design, analysis, findings,\u000a      and identification of key insights for policy:\u000a    \u000a      The DWP commissioned a research consortium (led by the National Centre\u000a        for Social\u000a        Research in collaboration with Skinner and Wikeley) to conduct the first\u000a        national survey of\u000a        separated mothers and fathers in the general population (n=1,956)\u000a        (Wikeley et al 2008:7).\u000a        Key insights were that parents favoured private agreements, but only if\u000a        supported by\u000a        effective information and support services.\u000a    \u000a    The Child Maintenance Enforcement Commission (CMEC) commissioned\u000a      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) with Skinner as consultant to conduct a\u000a      qualitative study\u000a      exploring willingness to pay child maintenance among 67 parents without\u000a      agreements. This\u000a      extended Skinner's earlier work (1999) confirming the vital role of\u000a      emotions and the quality of\u000a      family relationships in making financial commitments.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43468","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The IB approach was made Government policy and rolled out in England and\u000a      Wales as `personal\u000a      budgets' (PB).

The official target is for\u000a      70% of social care users to have a personal budget. 1.3 million people\u000a      received services in 2012-13\u000a      (Health and Social Care Information Centre).\u000a    The following is a selection of the major impacts, and is indicative of\u000a      the breadth and depth of the\u000a      impact of the research on policy and practice:\u000a    \u000a      DH published a detailed 37 page report specifically addressing IBSEN's\u000a        findings. This stated:\u000a        `The Department of Health welcomes the independent evaluation reports\u000a        produced by\u000a        [IBSEN].....The IBSEN research greatly improves our understanding of\u000a        these issues... it will\u000a        strongly inform [personal budget] implementation.... In moving forward,\u000a        strong attention will be\u000a        paid to those issues where the risks highlighted by IBSEN are most\u000a        significant....The lessons\u000a        learned from the separate research into carer's experiences of IBs ...\u000a        are also important.'\u000a        (passim, DH, 2008)1. The Appendix included details of\u000a        the actions taken by DH in response to\u000a        26 elements of the recommendations from IBSEN. These included: Ministers\u000a        looking at the\u000a        issues around incorporation of income streams when considering further\u000a        development of\u000a        individual budgets and feeding this into public consultation via the\u000a        welfare reform green paper\u000a        No One Written Off. Feeding insights from the evaluation into the\u000a        planning for personal health\u000a        budget pilots. Collating learning and best practice from IBSEN when\u000a        creating the\u000a        Personalisation Toolkit for councils. Feeding into Departmental\u000a        reviews on charging and also a\u000a        CSCI review of Fair Access to Care Services.\u000a      IBSEN findings on the poorer experiences of older people were\u000a        particularly problematic. The\u000a        Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE), on behalf of DH,\u000a        commissioned further research\u000a        from SPRU to identify good practice in delivering PBs to older people\u000a        and people with mental\u000a        health problems (Newbronner et al., 2011)2; this further\u000a        study is also widely cited in policy and\u000a        practice guidance. IBSEN also prompted the English Association of\u000a        Directors of Adult Social\u000a        Services (ADASS) to commission a further review of evidence and practice\u000a        in delivering PBs\u000a        for older people (Routledge and Carr 2013)3.\u000a      The IBSEN research was used to inform guidance on how best to\u000a        implement IBs in relation to\u000a        improving outcomes for carers. DH (2010)4\u000a\u000a      IBSEN shaped the DH approach to the design, piloting and evaluation of\u000a        NHS personal health\u000a        budgets (PHBs)5 between 2009-12: the DH commentary on the\u000a        IBSEN findings stated `the\u000a        issues and complexities raised have influenced the decision to pilot\u000a        Personal Health Budgets'1.\u000a        SPRU also played a key role in the PHB evaluation.\u000a      IBSEN evidence on the pilot projects' difficulties in integrating\u000a        funding streams shaped the\u000a        design of the Department for Work and Pension's (DWP) Right to Control `trailblazer'\u000a        pilot\u000a        projects introduced by the Welfare Reform Act 2009. Before commissioning\u000a        its evaluation of\u000a        the `trailblazers' DWP commissioned a feasibility study to learn\u000a        from the experiences of the\u000a        IBSEN evaluation. The report of the evaluation of Right to Control8\u000a        says \"The Right to Control\u000a        pilot .... builds on the Individual Budgets pilot .... The Right to\u000a        Control [pilot] also addresses\u000a        the legal and accountability barriers to integrated funding streams\u000a        identified in the evaluation of\u000a        the Individual Budgets pilot.'\u000a      Professor Glendinning contributed to policy debates by using examples\u000a        from IBSEN in oral\u000a        evidence to the House of Commons Health Committee's 2010 investigation\u000a        into social care.\u000a        From this, the Committee concluded that, despite consensus in favour of\u000a        personalisation, 'the\u000a        details of implementation are contentious'6\u000a\u000a      The new Coalition Government's Vision for Adult Social Care7\u000a        Green Paper cited both the\u000a        main IBSEN evaluation and the linked carers study in support of its\u000a        proposals to `make\u000a        personal budgets the norm for everyone who receives ongoing care and\u000a        support'.\u000a      The Audit Commission report on PBs9 cited evidence from\u000a        IBSEN on the costs of IBs to justify\u000a        the expectation that personal budgets should be cost-neutral.\u000a      A review10 of the published literature on self-directed\u000a        support for the Scottish Government,\u000a        commissioned to aid policy decisions in this area, drew attention to\u000a        IBSEN as a core report in\u000a        this policy area in England. It recommended the principles underpinning\u000a        IBs, as set out in the\u000a        `influential and detailed' IBSEN evaluation.\u000a      The South Australia State Minister for Disability and the Head of the\u000a        Disability Service visited\u000a        SPRU in 2011 to learn about the UK's experiences of implementing\u000a        personal budgets and to\u000a        discuss our recommendations. Australia was starting to look at its\u000a        disability provision in order to\u000a        reform it and bring it up to date. In 2013 Australia launched a new\u000a        disability insurance scheme\u000a        Disability Care Australia, with an emphasis on independence and control\u000a        for the service user\u000a        and including personal budgets to spend on care. South Australia is one\u000a        of the launch sites for\u000a        this policy and fed into the debates about its creation. There has been\u000a        subsequent research\u000a        collaboration between researchers in SPRU and Australia to compare\u000a        aspects of personal\u000a        budgets in each country.\u000a    \u000a    The range of impacts demonstrates how the IBSEN research influenced the\u000a      final implementation of\u000a      personal budgets in England by highlighting the challenges in applying\u000a      this level of personalisation\u000a      at local and national levels, and by recommending where extra care was\u000a      needed for different user\u000a      groups. It is an example which has been heeded by other countries as they\u000a      look to implement\u000a      more personalisation in their social care and health systems.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A major element of modernising English adult social care is the\u000a      introduction of individual, user-directed\u000a      budgets.

In 2006-8, Individual Budgets were piloted in 13 English\u000a      local authorities as a new\u000a      way of enabling social care users to exercise choice and control over\u000a      their support. An evaluation\u000a      of the pilots (named the IBSEN project, 2006-08) led by Professor\u000a      Glendinning (at York since\u000a      2004), SPRU, assessed the benefits and cost effectiveness of the pilots\u000a      and the challenges\u000a      involved in implementing IBs.\u000a    IBSEN included a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) &#8212; rare in English social\u000a      care research &#8212; that\u000a      compared outcomes against conventional methods of allocating and using\u000a      social care and other\u000a      resources. This was complemented by almost 1000 in-depth interviews with\u000a      IB users; interviews\u000a      with front line staff and senior managers; and analyses of practitioners'\u000a      time use. SPRU also\u000a      designed and led a linked study of the impact of IBs on carers.\u000a    IBSEN involved researchers from Personal Social Services Research Unit\u000a      (London School of\u000a      Economics, Manchester and Kent); and Social Care Workforce Research Unit,\u000a      (Kings College\u000a      London).

Dr Moran (research fellow, York, since 2006) led\u000a      strands on IB\u000a      implementation and qualitative outcomes.

Dr Arksey (senior research fellow, at York\u000a      1995-2010), Moran and Dr\u000a      Rabiee (research fellow, at York since 2001) were responsible for outcome\u000a      interviews with carers\u000a      and local authority implementation of IBs and carers.\u000a    The research team met regularly with DH research customers and a\u000a      Reference Group of\u000a      representatives from other government departments with interests in the\u000a      pilots.

However, there were variations in outcomes between different\u000a      groups of IB users:\u000a      satisfaction was highest among mental health service users and physically\u000a      disabled working age\u000a      people and lowest among older people.\u000a    Receipt of IBs was significantly associated with positive impacts on\u000a      carers' reported quality of life\u000a      and also, when other factors were taken into account, with carers' social\u000a      care outcomes.\u000a      The study generated extensive data on the challenges for central and local\u000a      government and the\u000a      social care workforce in implementing IBs.\u000a    SPRU published full and summary reports of the main evaluation: a report\u000a      of the linked study of\u000a      impact on carers and three widely circulated lay summaries (one\u000a      specifically for front-line staff).\u000a      SPRU organised two very well attended national conferences.

In 1999, informed by this and others' evidence, Tony Blair\u000a      declared that it was the\u000a      Government's intention to eradicate child poverty within 20 years. Child\u000a      poverty became a major\u000a      preoccupation of the UK government. A strategy was developed which\u000a      included targets and\u000a      monitoring. Using the results of our 1999 Poverty and Social Exclusion\u000a      survey, at a seminar with\u000a      officials and through membership of DWP advisory groups, we persuaded the\u000a      DWP to adopt a\u000a      third tier (deprivation based) child poverty measure. This and other\u000a      multi-dimensional indicators\u000a      were adopted in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Opportunity\u000a        for all series. The\u000a      measure was adopted in the Child Poverty Act 2010 targets. A child poverty\u000a      strategy was\u000a      published in 2012 which proposed to use a range of child well-being\u000a      indicators. In October 2012\u000a      the Government announced a consultation on the measurement of child\u000a      poverty to which we\u000a      submitted robust evidence.\u000a    Influenced by this UK experience in 2008, the EU Statistics on Income and\u000a      Living Conditions\u000a      (SILC) adopted a similar set of deprivation indicators, and in SILC 2009 a\u000a      special module on child\u000a      deprivation was introduced. We were the first to analyse it (for UNICEF\u000a      Innocenti RC 10). In 2010\u000a      a deprivation measure was adopted into the EU 2020 Poverty and Social\u000a      Inclusion strategy\u000a      targets.\u000a    UNICEF Innocenti Report Card 7 in 2007 based on our index of child\u000a      well-being had the UK at the\u000a      bottom of the international league table of rich countries. This provoked\u000a      a public outcry and\u000a      enormous media interest. This and the resulting Ditchley Declaration,\u000a      an agreed, cross-party\u000a      statement of principles and proposals of what should be done to improve\u000a      child well-being in the\u000a      UK, contributed to revitalising the child poverty strategy in 2008 and\u000a      2009. The Department for\u000a      Children, Schools and Families published a revision to The Children's\u000a        Plan in 2009 which drew on\u000a      a review of evidence that was very similar to that covered in our Well-being\u000a        of children in the UK\u000a      reviews1.\u000a    The development of our local index of child well-being at the behest of\u000a      DCLG proved very useful\u000a      for local authorities, who under the Child Poverty Act (Part 2, Section\u000a      22) are required to prepare\u000a      and publish an assessment of the needs of children living in poverty in\u000a      their area. Many of these\u000a      needs assessments drew on the index directly2 and are a\u000a      resource to support the development of\u000a      a local Child Poverty Strategy. The data from our index was made available\u000a      on the DCLG website\u000a      and also by the NHS Observatory of Maternity and Child Health (CHIMAT).\u000a    In 2010 David Cameron asked the Office of National Statistics (ONS) to\u000a      monitor the general well-being\u000a\u0009  of the population. ONS established two working groups to develop\u000a      measures. Jonathan\u000a      Bradshaw and Gwyther Rees (Children's Society) were asked to join the\u000a      Children and Young\u000a      People Working Group. Our experience of surveying children about their\u000a      subjective well-being has\u000a      proven very influential3 and we have contributed to a review\u000a      of available sources and undertaken\u000a      pilot work towards the establishment of national well-being measures for\u000a      children.\u000a    The evidence is that child well-being has been improving in the UK. Most\u000a      child indicators have\u000a      improved. In 2011\/12 child poverty had fallen to 17% from 26% in 1998\/9.\u000a      There is also evidence\u000a      from our analysis of Understanding Society data that child subjective\u000a      well-being improved\u000a      significantly between 1994 and 2011. In the UNICEF Innocenti Report card\u000a      11 published in 2013\u000a      the UK had moved up the international league table of 29 rich countries\u000a      from bottom to 16th. Our\u000a      work has contributed to these outcomes and to our capacity to measure\u000a      them.\u000a    More generally, our work has contributed to taking the national and\u000a      international discourse beyond\u000a      income poverty. Child well-being is now a preoccupation of the UK\u000a      government and non-governmental\u000a\u0009  organisations (NGOs), international organisations, such as\u000a      the OECD, UNICEF and\u000a      the European Union. Indeed, both the European Commission and the OECD are\u000a      now publishing 4\u000a      deprivation based poverty measures and multi-dimensional well-being\u000a      indicators that we\u000a      pioneered. In 2013 the EU published a first Council Conclusion on Tackling\u000a        child poverty and\u000a        promoting child well-being.\u000a    Jonathan Bradshaw 5 who led this work has used his influence\u000a      as: Advisor to the House of\u000a      Commons Work and Pensions Committee (2003); Member of the DWP Technical\u000a      Working Group\u000a      on measuring child poverty (2003); UK expert on the EU group of experts on\u000a      social inclusion\u000a      (2005-); Member or the JRF Technical Group on a Strategy for Child Poverty\u000a      (2006); Member of\u000a      the Ministerial Advisory Committee on child poverty (2006); Member of the\u000a      Board of the\u000a      International Society for Child Indicators (2007-2013); Fellow of the\u000a      British Academy (2010-);\u000a      Member of the ONS National well-being advisory group (2010-2012); Honorary\u000a      Fellow, UNICEF\u000a      UK (2012-); and as a Trustee of the Child Poverty Action Group (2012-).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Jonathan Bradshaw and colleagues at York influenced UK and international\u000a      measures of child\u000a      poverty, child deprivation and child well-being.

There are four elements to the\u000a      research since 1993\u000a      which were original and have made an impact:\u000a    1. Four books on child well-being in the UK were the first \"state of\u000a      children\" reports produced in\u000a      Britain. In 1994 UNICEF, concerned about rising child poverty rates in\u000a      rich countries,\u000a      commissioned a series of national case studies. Bradshaw (Professor\u000a      1988-present) wrote the UK\u000a      case. In 1995 the ESRC launched the 5-16 initiative and Bradshaw\u000a      successfully bid to develop that\u000a      work with a project entitled Poverty: the outcomes for children.\u000a      That resulted in a book and nine\u000a      articles.

He left a\u000d\u000a      paper \"The reform of incapacity benefits &#8212; thoughts towards a new\u000d\u000a        `working age benefit'\". Hodge wrote in September to thank him for\u000d\u000a      contributing to her ideas about future policy proposals (letter available\u000d\u000a      for scrutiny). Some of the ideas in the paper were reflected in the Green\u000d\u000a      Paper, A New Deal for Welfare (DWP 2006), in the chapter, `Long\u000d\u000a      term benefits reform'.\u000d\u000a    The paper was the basis of an article (Sainsbury 2006) that introduced\u000d\u000a      the phrase `single working age benefit'. During 2006, this idea of\u000d\u000a      a single working age benefit fed into policy making through:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Speech by Sainsbury at Labour Party Conference\u000d\u000a      Meeting with John Williams, Special Political Adviser to Secretary of\u000d\u000a        State, John Hutton\u000d\u000a      Meeting with Government adviser David Freud to discuss radical benefit\u000d\u000a        reform and the single working age benefit. The Freud Report published in\u000d\u000a        March 2006 contained a chapter \"Benefit reform &#8212; towards a single\u000d\u000a        system\" reflecting many of the ideas discussed with him.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In March 2007, Sainsbury was appointed Specialist Adviser to the Work and\u000d\u000a      Pensions Select Committee for its Inquiry into Benefits Simplification.\u000d\u000a      The Committee's report contains a chapter on fundamental changes to the\u000d\u000a      benefit system discussing the single working age benefit in detail. In\u000d\u000a      July 2007, a key paper by Sainsbury and Stanley set out a revised version\u000d\u000a      of the single working age benefit as a blueprint for radical benefit\u000d\u000a      reform.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, the Labour Government published two important Green Papers. No\u000a        One Written Off (DWP 2008a) contains a chapter on \"Simplifying and\u000d\u000a      streamlining the benefit system\" and Raising Expectations and\u000d\u000a          Increasing Support \" (DWP 2008b) reaffirms \"we remain\u000d\u000a      attracted to the idea of a single working age benefit ...\" (p.35). Both\u000d\u000a      Green Papers cited Sainsbury and Stanley (2007). In July 2009, DWP\u000d\u000a      commissioned SPRU to conduct research on public attitudes to the single\u000d\u000a      working age benefit (published as Sainsbury and Weston 2010).\u000d\u000a    In February 2009, David Freud became welfare reform adviser to the\u000d\u000a      Conservative Opposition. He introduced radical benefit reform to Iain\u000d\u000a      Duncan Smith (currently Secretary of State for Work and Pensions) who had\u000d\u000a      established the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ). In September 2009, CSJ\u000d\u000a      published Dynamic Benefits, which developed the single working age\u000d\u000a      benefit idea further, citing Sainsbury and Stanley (2007). After the 2010\u000d\u000a      Election, radical reform became a priority of the Coalition government. It\u000d\u000a      published a Green Paper, 21st Century Welfare, in July based on Dynamic\u000a        Benefits, citing Sainsbury and Stanley (2007), and a later White\u000d\u000a      Paper, Universal Credit &#8212; welfare that works, that cited both\u000d\u000a      Sainsbury and Stanley (2007) and Sainsbury and Weston (2010). [text\u000d\u000a      removed for publication]\u000d\u000a    The Welfare Reform Bill reached the Committee stage in March 2011.\u000d\u000a      Sainsbury was invited to give oral evidence referred to in a subsequent\u000d\u000a      Committee hearing: Kate Green (Lab): \"I was also very struck by\u000d\u000a      the evidence that we received from Professor Roy Sainsbury last\u000d\u000a      week, when he said that the public as a whole favour individual assessment\u000d\u000a      and individual arrangements.\" (Hansard Minutes of the Standing Committee\u000d\u000a      on the Welfare Reform Bill, 29 March 2011: Col 176). It was also cited in\u000d\u000a      the House of Lords debate on the Bill: Baroness Lister: \"Indeed, Professor\u000a        Roy Sainsbury told the Public Bill Committee in the other place that\u000d\u000a      in research with claimants, \"individual assessment spontaneously arose as\u000d\u000a      a thing that people were very keen on\".\" (Hansard House of Lords Debates,\u000d\u000a      13 Sep 2011: Column 727).\u000d\u000a    Further evidence of impact comes from House of Lords debates. One\u000d\u000a      demonstrates how the Labour government had accepted the single working age\u000d\u000a      benefit: Lord Knight: \"When we were in Government, we were committed to a\u000d\u000a      single working age benefit.\" (Hansard House of Lords Debates, 13\u000d\u000a      Sep 2011: Column 721). The other, from a senior Liberal Democrat peer\u000d\u000a      recognised as an authority on social security, Lord Kirkwood, serves as a\u000d\u000a      summary of the impact claimed in this submission: \"I counsel the coalition\u000d\u000a      Government about over claiming. ... It is said that this is all a great\u000d\u000a      revolution but people such as Professor Roy Sainsbury at York have\u000d\u000a      been talking about it for years.\" Hansard House of Lords Debates, 13 Sep\u000d\u000a      2011: Column 685.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A major element of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 is the introduction of Universal\u000a        Credit, which is widely recognised as the most radical reform of the\u000d\u000a      UK social security system since the 1942 Beveridge Report. Universal\u000d\u000a      Credit will be rolled out nationally from October 2013 and affect the\u000d\u000a      lives of millions of working age people. Universal Credit recipients who\u000d\u000a      are working will be the main beneficiaries receiving more than under the\u000d\u000a      previous Tax Credit arrangements (which are being abolished).

Up to around 2005, the aim of\u000d\u000a      welfare reform had been pursued principally through significant\u000d\u000a      innovations in employment policy. In comparison, benefit reform was much\u000d\u000a      more limited, and had mainly focused on incremental changes to long-term\u000d\u000a      sickness benefits. However, prompted partly by a report from the National\u000d\u000a      Audit Office in 2005, and a subsequent report by the House of Commons\u000d\u000a      Public Accounts Committee in 2006, the government began to think seriously\u000d\u000a      about wider social security reform.\u000d\u000a    At this point, Sainsbury's contribution- in a series of articles and\u000d\u000a      research papers and through personal engagement with policy makers-was to\u000d\u000a      recast the challenge of welfare reform as one of designing a social\u000d\u000a      security system that would complement employment policy changes, rather\u000d\u000a      than tackling social security in isolation as in the past. This insight\u000d\u000a      emerged from reflecting on a series of related research projects since\u000d\u000a      1997 on social security and welfare to work programmes, including the New\u000d\u000a      Deal for Disabled People (2001-2006), and Incapacity Benefit Reforms\u000d\u000a      Pilots (Pathways to Work (2003-2007). These projects showed that labour\u000d\u000a      market initiatives consistently fell short of both expectations and\u000d\u000a      aspirations, and that a contributory reason was the structure and\u000d\u000a      complexity of the social security system (see for example Lewis et al,\u000d\u000a      2005; Corden et al, 2005).\u000d\u000a    The original contribution by Sainsbury about social security reform was\u000d\u000a      to argue that the current system's inherent weaknesses, flaws and\u000d\u000a      dysfunctions could not be solved or removed by the sort of incremental\u000d\u000a      change that had characterised UK social security policy since 1948. What\u000d\u000a      was needed was radical change on a scale that had not been attempted since\u000d\u000a      the post-war Beveridge reforms. Sainsbury thus introduced the concept of\u000d\u000a      (and coined the term) the `single working age benefit' &#8212; a radical\u000d\u000a      restructuring of social security for working age people that would\u000d\u000a      actively support the transition of unemployed people into work (Sainsbury\u000d\u000a      2006).\u000d\u000a    The impact claimed here is that government policy on welfare reform,\u000d\u000a      specifically the reform of the social security system, was influenced by\u000d\u000a      the work and writing of Roy Sainsbury, and by research and dissemination\u000d\u000a      from SPRU (i.e. rather than from a specific piece or large programme of\u000d\u000a      research). As argued in section 4 below, the impact can be detected in\u000d\u000a      policy debates and documents from 2006 onwards up to the passage of the\u000d\u000a      Welfare Reform Bill through parliament in 2011 (which became the Welfare\u000d\u000a      Reform Act in 2012).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43519","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Before this research was carried out very little was formally known about\u000d      domestic abuse in same sex relationships.

Stonewall Housing used findings to secure funding for\u000d      the national LGBT DVA forum, a conduit for sharing best practice, research\u000d      and improving services for LGBT victim\/survivors [4]. Within the North\u000d      East, a steering group used the research to apply for the first regional\u000d      LGBT DV development worker (funded by Northern Rock Foundation in 2009 for\u000d      three years initially, and since, 2013, for a further year until Sept 2014\u000d      and thereafter for 2 years dependent on matched funding). In addition to a\u000d      range of activities to raise awareness of LGBT DV in the region, the\u000d      development worker has drawn on the research to create and roll out\u000d      specific training on the topic for all service providers and a Train the\u000d      Trainers course (these have occurred between 2008- currently). Trainees\u000d      for the latter come from a range of agencies across the region committed\u000d      to cascading the training within their geographical areas. Separately, the\u000d      MARAC report led to further funding from Sunderland DVA partnership for\u000d      specific regional training for mainstream and specialist DVA services\u000d      focussed on referring LGBT victim\/survivors to MARACs [5].\u000d    The ESRC research has also influenced practice on a national level among\u000d      agencies that traditionally have only experienced working with\u000d      heterosexual victims of DVA, thus increasing the support available to LGBT\u000d      victims around the UK. For example, Co-ordinated Action Against Domestic\u000d      Abuse (CAADA) used the research to inform the input on LGBT\u000d      victim\/survivors on their national training course for IDVAs [6]. In\u000d      Cardiff the Dyn Project, part of the Women's Safety Unit, were influenced\u000d      by the research to develop a risk assessment check list for gay men\u000d      recognising their vulnerability to sexual violence and in their evaluation\u000d      recommended further work and research on the risk assessment form in\u000d      relation to gay and heterosexual men [7]. The current Community Safety\u000d      Commissioner for Brighton and Hove Council, formerly of the Dyn Project\u000d      and CAADA said of the research `as it currently stands, it remains one of\u000d      the most important yet accessible pieces of work of its kind for these\u000d      communities in the UK' [6].

The Learning Development Coordinator of\u000d      Scottish Women's Aid said the ESRC research provided a way of seeing\u000d      similarities and differences between heterosexual and LGBT domestic\u000d      violence and for the agencies providing services to these different groups\u000d      `it provided an impetus and a focus to strengthening our work together'\u000d      [8].\u000d    Great effort has been made to disseminate the research to wide an\u000d      audience as possible to raise awareness of DV within LGBT relationships.\u000d      The Coordinator of the national LGBT DV Forum identifies the research\u000d      `groundbreaking' [4] and it appears on their website &#8212; as it does on the\u000d      website of Broken Rainbow the national helpline for LGBT victim\/survivors\u000d      of DVA (Donovan is on the Board) and Stop Domestic Abuse an LGBT DV\u000d      project in Scotland.

This research is the first of its kind from a\u000d      comparative social science perspective focussing as it does on women and\u000d      men across gender and sexuality. The research was collaborative between\u000d      Donovan (University of Sunderland, 1996-currently), and Hester (previously\u000d      of University of Sunderland until 2003) at Bristol University. Methods\u000d      included a national community survey of `what happens when things go\u000d      wrong' in same sex relationships; focus groups with heterosexual women,\u000d      men, lesbians and gay men; and interviews with 67 heterosexual women, men,\u000d      and self-defined non-heterosexual women and men. The survey was designed\u000d      to allow comparison with the British Crime Survey (BCS) as a proxy for the\u000d      heterosexual experience of domestic violence. Interviews focussed on\u000d      respondents' `worst' and `best' relationship experiences so that accounts\u000d      of love and violence could be explored.\u000d    Specific insights include:\u000d    a. DVA (when one partner exerts power and control over the other partner\u000d      using physical, financial, sexual, emotional, isolating, threatening\u000d      behaviours) is a substantial problem in same sex relationships in the UK;\u000d    b. DVA in same sex relationships is often not recognised as such because\u000d      of the impact of the public story which identifies DVA as a heterosexual\u000d      problem of men for women; as a problem of predominantly physical violence;\u000d      and as a problem of gender in that the `bigger, stronger' embodied male\u000d      exerts power and control over the `smaller, weaker' embodied female';\u000d    c. The public story also impacts negatively on the help-seeking of\u000d      victim\/survivors in same sex relationships as they fear responses of\u000d      disbelief, minimisation, denial and\/or homo\/bi-phobia; and because of the\u000d      subsequent gap of trust between these victim\/survivors and mainstream and\u000d      specialist DVA services. For example, findings showed that the police were\u000d      the least often reported to out of a list of ten potential sources of\u000d      help\/support whilst the British Crime Survey shows that the police are the\u000d      second or third choice for heterosexual women (depending on whether\u000d      friends and family are grouped together or separately);\u000d    d. mutual abuse, rather than being common amongst same sex relationships\u000d      (because of the assumption made that two women or two men must be\u000d      `equal'), is rare and in most cases one partner exerts power and control\u000d      over the other.\u000d    e. those in first same sex relationships were often at risk of\u000d      experiencing domestic violence because they did not `know' what to expect\u000d      in a same sex relationship and\/or believed it to be normal;\u000d    f. LGBT DV training and awareness raising is required amongst mainstream\u000d      and DV specialist agencies; and\u000d    g. raising awareness is required among LGBT communities.\u000d    Subsequent research (March-June 2010) by Donovan explored the treatment\u000d      of LGBT DV victim\/survivors by the national DV strategy as enacted through\u000d      the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARACs) and Independent\u000d      Domestic Violence Advocates (IDVAs). This strategy focuses resources on\u000d      those victim\/survivors at the highest risk.\u000d      Nationally LGBT referrals to the MARAC are disproportionately low. A study\u000d      exploring barriers to referring LGBT victim\/survivors to MARACs identified\u000d      the following insights:\u000d    a. training and awareness raising about LGBT DV is required for agencies\u000d      potentially referring victim\/survivors to the MARACs but especially the\u000d      police particularly in relation to the use of the risk assessment tool and\u000d      the specific vulnerabilities of LGBT victim\/survivors of DVA;\u000d    b. most referrals to MARACs are from the police yet very few LGBT\u000d      victim\/survivors report to the police so they are unlikely to be referred\u000d      to the MARAC;\u000d    c. domestic violence in same sex relationships is not recognised either\u000d      within LGBT communities or within mainstream or specialist agencies;\u000d    d. the public story about DV &#8212; whilst accurate for the majority of cases\u000d      of domestic violence &#8212; should not be the only model portrayed in the\u000d      literature of agencies or in domestic violence campaigns.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43523","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Collectively the body of research has informed the evidence base for\u000d      policymakers at regional and national level as well as public discussion\u000d      about different forms of social inclusion. It has also aided individual\u000d      partner organisations to secure external funding and to adopt new\u000d      practices.\u000d    In terms of public discussion, the project examining social class and\u000d      higher education has been subject to significant coverage and debate\u000d      through popular media. Key findings were reported by the Times Higher\u000d      Education supplement (Attwood, 15\/05\/08) [1] and members of the project\u000d      team have opened these issues up to wider audiences by appearing on\u000d      `Thinking Allowed' on BBC Radio 4 (03\/03\/10) [2].

The interim report of the\u000d      `National Strategy for Access and Student Success' published by the\u000d      Higher Education Funding Council England (HEFCE) (2013) [5], includes this\u000d      research in discussion of student success and senses of belonging in HE.\u000d      References also feature in the Department of Business Innovation and\u000d      Skills' (BIS) Research Paper `Understanding Higher Education in Further\u000d        Education Colleges' (2012) [6] which considers why working class\u000d      students may be deterred from specific HE institutions. In the `Response\u000a        to the social mobility commission' from the UK Commission for\u000d      Employment and Skills (2008) [7] the research contributes to the evidence\u000d      base around unequal experiences of HE and the importance of supporting\u000d      students in accessing opportunities at university. Other policy related\u000d      citations include the RSA's examination of the social class gap in\u000d      educational achievement (2010) [8] which uses the research to argue for\u000d      the need for policy innovation.\u000d    On the basis of expertise developed through the digital inclusion\u000d      project, Dr. Clayton was commissioned by the Institute of Prospective\u000d      Technologies at the European Commission to conduct an `Exhaustive Locality\u000d      Mapping' of organisations in Sunderland [9] which facilitate access to\u000d      ICT. This has led to the design of a typology of ICT actors for use in a\u000d      major survey mapping of e-Inclusion actors and their impact across Europe\u000d      (MIREIA). This has therefore aided the development of a process led by the\u000d      EC, which looks to monitor and improve levels of ICT access across the EU.\u000d      The digital inclusion project has also been considered by the UK\u000d      Government with regard to digital inclusion policy [10]. A representative\u000d      of the Cabinet Office commented on the questions it raises around why\u000d      socially excluded communities may not engage successfully with digital\u000d      inclusion initiatives.\u000d    Following the evaluation work for the Just B Me youth project, the youth\u000d      group were able to use the study as evidence of good practice, which\u000d      enabled it to attract 3 years funding through the Henry Smith Charity. It\u000d      also helped to foster closer collaboration with the City Council.\u000d      According to the Chair of the steering group it \"...was influential in\u000d        brokering discussions between the city council and the youth project\u000d        about meeting the needs of BME young people in the west end of Newcastle.\"\u000a      [11] The evaluation report had a major impact on the approaches of the\u000d      Scotswood Area Strategy and its acceptance for a clearer focus on\u000d      intercultural youth work.

These and further research outputs on the social\u000d\u000a      history of leisure in Britain developed a specific angle of approach to\u000d\u000a      Mass Observation's Worktown project as an historical archive of everyday\u000d\u000a      leisure, leading to the presentation of a leisure histories conference in\u000d\u000a      Bolton Museum in 2008. This conference created high levels of academic and\u000d\u000a      public interest and led to the establishment of the Centre for Worktown\u000d\u000a      Studies in 2009. The Centre therefore evolved from research.\u000d\u000a    Further `Recording Leisure Lives' conferences on the social history and\u000d\u000a      photographic documentation of leisure in 20th century Britain\u000d\u000a      were jointly presented by the University and Bolton Museum, attended by\u000d\u000a      academic historians, documentary photographers and members of the public.\u000d\u000a      Key research outputs emanating from the five conferences 2008-2012 were\u000d\u000a      the published post-conference volumes with Snape [Reader in Leisure and\u000d\u000a      Sport] as principal editor. The Centre has engaged Bolton's public in the\u000d\u000a      historical research of leisure, enabling collaborative work with Bolton\u000d\u000a      Museum, the Octagon Theatre and the Mass Observation Archive.\u000d\u000a    Swain's research in sports history has adopted Bolton \/ Worktown as a\u000d\u000a      case study locus and has been published in national and international\u000d\u000a      reviewed journals. It has also been featured in local newspapers. He has\u000d\u000a      conducted two funded oral history projects in Bolton on rounders and the\u000d\u000a      cinema. In addition to the post-conference volumes, Snape (2013) has\u000d\u000a      published research on All-in wrestling in Worktown and presented this to a\u000d\u000a      public audience at the Museum's Spender Anniversary conference in October\u000d\u000a      2012. He also presented on Worktown at the University of Sussex Mass\u000d\u000a      Observation 75th Anniversary conference, July 2012.\u000d\u000a    The Centre obtained funding for an AHRC PhD studentship in October 2011.\u000d\u000a      The student is undertaking practice-based community arts research with the\u000d\u000a      Spender Worktown Collection and co-curated the Museum's 75th\u000d\u000a      Mass Observation Anniversary Spender exhibition. The University's\u000d\u000a      Institute for Educational Cybernetics has researched a geo-location mobile\u000d\u000a      phone \"app\" for the Spender pictures. Beyond the University the Centre has\u000d\u000a      been visited by Worktown scholars from Australia and Canada.\u000d\u000a    The Centre has established a working partnership with the Mass\u000d\u000a      Observation Archive at the University of Sussex. Snape presented at the\u000d\u000a      Mass Observation 75th Anniversary conference at Sussex in July\u000d\u000a      2012.\u000d\u000a    Beesley [Course Leader MA Documentary Photography] obtained Marriott\u000d\u000a      Trust funding for four Humphrey Spender postgraduate scholarships for\u000d\u000a      practice-based research through community projects; these engaged the\u000d\u000a      public of Bolton with the Spender Mass Observation collection through\u000d\u000a      active involvement and exhibitions at Bolton Museum.

From this stage on there was extensive\u000d\u000a      engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders. The LSE Report served as a\u000d\u000a      pre-conference document for review by leading US academics, industry\u000d\u000a      representatives from both small and large companies and associations\u000d\u000a      (including AstraZeneca, Basilea Pharmaceutica, and the European Federation\u000d\u000a      of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations), government and regulatory\u000d\u000a      officials (including those from DG Enterprise at the EC; UK Health\u000d\u000a      Protection Agency), and key representatives of international and\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organizations (including the WHO). The importance of the\u000d\u000a      report was acknowledged by the Swedish Ministry for Health and Social\u000d\u000a      Affairs [B], and was officially presented by the Swedish Presidency of the\u000d\u000a      Council of the European Union in the latter half of the Stockholm\u000d\u000a      conference. It was published in 2010 by the WHO as a book [2].\u000d\u000a    Following the Conference, the Swedish Prime Minister proposed to the US\u000d\u000a      President the formation of a Transatlantic Taskforce with the European\u000d\u000a      Union (Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance &#8212; TATFAR) to\u000d\u000a      encourage global research and development of new antibiotics, to address\u000d\u000a      antimicrobial resistance, and to push for legislation. The formation of\u000d\u000a      this taskforce &#8212; signed into effect by Swedish Prime Minister Reinfeldt of\u000d\u000a      Sweden and US President Obama &#8212; was explicitly intended to build on the\u000d\u000a      LSE Report [C]. The LSE work was also cited extensively in the TATFAR's\u000d\u000a      findings [D].\u000d\u000a    Further evidence of engagement with the recommendations of the LSE Report\u000d\u000a      comes from Professor Otto Cars, Director of the Swedish Strategic\u000d\u000a      Programme Against Antibiotic Resistance, who in 2010 described the work as\u000d\u000a      \"pioneering\" and emphasized that it would have \"a marked influence on\u000d\u000a      future development in the field\"[E]. In 2009 and 2010 the LSE work also\u000d\u000a      received further significant international media coverage [F, G]. And in\u000d\u000a      the April 2011 edition of the journal Nature, the authors of a\u000d\u000a      paper on the need for action in re-igniting antibiotic research concluded\u000d\u000a      that the LSE recommendations for a \"push-pull\" response are a \"clear\u000d\u000a      front-runner\" in the possible courses of action.\" [H]\u000d\u000a    Two of the LSE's specific recommendations have been implemented. First,\u000d\u000a      the LSE research was presented on more than ten occasions to key\u000d\u000a      stakeholders in Sweden, London, Washington DC and Brussels over the period\u000d\u000a      2009-2011, focusing on the need for public-private risk-sharing at\u000d\u000a      critical stages of antibiotic research and development, particularly that\u000d\u000a      of clinical trials. In early 2012 the public-private partnership between\u000d\u000a      the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      Industries and Associations (EFPIA) &#8212; the Innovative Medical Initiative\u000d\u000a      (IMI) &#8212; announced an (equally) shared commitment of &#8364;220 million for the\u000d\u000a      development of new antibiotics, intended to facilitate partnerships\u000d\u000a      between academic and industry researchers focused on new antibiotics and\u000d\u000a      to share the risks of clinical trials [I].\u000d\u000a    Second, the recommendation for regulatory reform to increase the rewards\u000d\u000a      to the industry by giving a greater measure of market protection via\u000d\u000a      intellectual property extensions was discussed and cited in expert\u000d\u000a      testimony given in the United States Congress in 2010 and again in 2012\u000d\u000a      [J]. Such testimonies were crucial to the passing of bipartisan\u000d\u000a      legislation in mid-2012, which established greater market protection for\u000d\u000a      vital new antibiotics reaching the market via intellectual property\u000d\u000a      extensions for data generated. (The \"GAIN Act\" of S. 3187, 112th Cong.,\u000d\u000a      2nd Sess.)\u000d\u000a    In addition, in 2011 the research provoked discussion in the arena of\u000d\u000a      national defence in the US [K, L]. It was presented within an expert panel\u000d\u000a      at the US Institute of Medicine's workshop on medical counter measures to\u000d\u000a      terrorism that is generally accepted to have opened the door for the U.S.\u000d\u000a      Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) &#8212; best\u000d\u000a      known for developing vaccines and therapies as medical countermeasures to\u000d\u000a      bioterrorism threats &#8212; to award a series of contracts for antibiotic\u000d\u000a      research. The work was also picked up by major industry players who had\u000d\u000a      not been part of the original \"Stockholm\" group &#8212; demonstrating wider\u000d\u000a      industry acceptance of report findings and recommendations [M].\u000d\u000a    Today the debate over a new incentive structure to promote research on\u000d\u000a      and development of new antibiotics is still underway in the US and within\u000d\u000a      the European institutions. The work of the Unit has been the first to\u000d\u000a      explore how this might be done and continues to lead the debate. It is\u000d\u000a      undertaking new research funded by the Pew Charitable Trust in late 2012\u000d\u000a      ($150,000) on how to disentangle the supply- and demand-side bottlenecks\u000d\u000a      currently preventing badly needed diagnostics for bacterial infections\u000d\u000a      from making it to the market.\u000d\u000a    Wider Implications: Millions of cases of resistance to antibiotics\u000d\u000a      occur each year, adding to the burden of disease. It is estimated that\u000d\u000a      annual hospital deaths from antibiotic resistant pathogens already tops\u000d\u000a      25,000 patients in the EU alone. The Unit's work has helped to overcome\u000d\u000a      some of the traditional market failures associated with the development of\u000d\u000a      new antibiotics and has contributed to important policy changes in Europe\u000d\u000a      and the USA. By improving incentives to R&amp;D in new antibiotics, the\u000d\u000a      Unit's research should assist with reducing levels of both morbidity and\u000d\u000a      mortality in Europe and beyond.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Millions of cases of multi-drug resistance bacterial infection occur each\u000d\u000a      year. Yet the pharmaceutical industry has all but ceased investing in\u000d\u000a      antibiotic development due to a combination of low profits and lack of\u000d\u000a      appropriate incentives. In her 2011 Annual Report, the Chief Medical\u000d\u000a      Officer called for more attention to be given to an antimicrobial\u000d\u000a      resistance strategy for the UK and worldwide. The Unit's work analysed the\u000d\u000a      nature of the incentives necessary to get antibiotic R&amp;D going again.\u000d\u000a      In particular it served as the basis for an urgent request by the EU\u000d\u000a      Council for action and sparked the formation of the critical\u000d\u000a      `transatlantic taskforce' (TATFAR): the first major international\u000d\u000a      collaboration to tackle antibiotic resistance. Recommendations from the\u000d\u000a      work served as the foundation for an EU-level public\/private partnership\u000d\u000a      and for US regulatory reform.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    London School of Economics and Political Science\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London School of Economics and Political Science","InstitutionName":"London School of Economics & Political Science","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004063}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2673730","Name":"Stockholm"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Mossialos, E., Kanavos, P., Abel-Smith, B.

Subsequent work\u000d\u000a      on different ways of stimulating the development of new vaccines for\u000d\u000a      neglected diseases [3] attracted the attention of the Swedish Government,\u000d\u000a      which made the problem of antibiotics one of its priorities for its\u000d\u000a      Presidency of the European Union (in 2009). The Swedish Ministry of Health\u000d\u000a      and Social Affairs asked LSE Health to explore ways of promoting the\u000d\u000a      development of new priority antibiotics (&#8364;120,000 grant).\u000d\u000a    The resulting LSE report [4] explored in depth the market failures in\u000d\u000a      respect of producing new antibiotics and analysed different incentive\u000d\u000a      frameworks to develop them. The report analysed over 20 different\u000d\u000a      incentive frameworks to stimulate the production of new antibiotics,\u000d\u000a      focusing on both `push' and `pull' mechanisms. Push mechanisms reduce the\u000d\u000a      costs of the R&amp;D process for research groups or (usually smaller)\u000d\u000a      companies (e.g. via start-up funds). Pull mechanisms promise (usually\u000d\u000a      large) companies a reward if goals regarding a new product are achieved,\u000d\u000a      with the aim of getting companies with experience in antibiotic\u000d\u000a      development to go through the full set of research and development stages.\u000d\u000a      The Unit's research stressed the importance of possible combinations of\u000d\u000a      push and pull incentives, setting out the expected magnitude of impact and\u000d\u000a      overall financial and political feasibility for each incentive, and\u000d\u000a      recommended policy responses at the national and international (e.g. EU)\u000d\u000a      level.\u000d\u000a    In particular, the Report made specific recommendations on:\u000d\u000a    (i) The need for new approaches to risk sharing on the part of the key\u000d\u000a      actors &#8212; governments and private producers of antibiotics. The Report\u000d\u000a      attached considerable importance to the potential of these public\/private\u000d\u000a      partnerships at key stages of the R&amp;D process. On the `pull' side,\u000d\u000a      these partnerships would specify and reward the development of goals for\u000d\u000a      antibiotic development, while on the `push' side they would seek to reduce\u000d\u000a      the costs of the R&amp;D process, particularly of clinical trials.\u000d\u000a    (ii) The importance of regulatory reform that would act as an appropriate\u000d\u000a      incentive, for example, protecting intellectual property for an extended\u000d\u000a      period. This in turn would protect against market competition (something\u000d\u000a      that was particularly important for US companies). The Report called\u000d\u000a      attention to the way in which such extensions are particularly useful for\u000d\u000a      drugs like antibiotics, where greater rewards are needed to spur the full\u000d\u000a      development of the drug (a push factor), but where linking the reward to\u000d\u000a      the long-term efficacy of the drug is also important (a pull factor).\u000d\u000a    In 2010 and 2013 the research was published in high-impact journals [5,6]\u000d\u000a      and was expanded to include a closer comparative analysis using 20\u000d\u000a      essential criteria deriving from the various stakeholder perspectives\u000d\u000a      (long-term public health, regulatory authorities, industry) [7]. In\u000d\u000a      particular this research proposed a new incentive that combined the\u000d\u000a      critical elements inherent in existing (successful) regulatory incentives\u000d\u000a      with those that respond to the specific needs of antibiotics market, that\u000d\u000a      is, incentives intended to limit over-marketing and over-consumption of\u000d\u000a      any new drug in order to slow the growth of resistance over the\u000d\u000a      medium-to-long-term.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers: Professor Elias Mossialos has been at LSE from\u000d\u000a      1992.

However, couples also feel that\u000d\u000a        they appreciate their differences and have access to wider social\u000d\u000a        resources (1, 2, 6).\u000d\u000a      The findings from the African-Caribbean and Italian\u000a            Families studies indicated that `mixed' families experience\u000d\u000a        challenges of adjustment, but also opportunities to bridge ethnic and\u000d\u000a        racial divides. The opportunities are often taken for granted and are\u000d\u000a        rarely considered (1, 2, 6).\u000d\u000a      Findings from the Parenting `Mixed' Children study\u000d\u000a        showed that `mixed' couples use a variety of approaches to give their\u000d\u000a        children a sense of belonging and identity which are not necessarily\u000d\u000a        associated with particular racial or faith combinations (3, 4, 5).\u000d\u000a      Approaches include: Individual: children's sense of belonging\u000d\u000a        not rooted in their mixed background; Mix: all aspects of\u000d\u000a        children's mixed background are emphasised; and Single: one\u000d\u000a        aspect of children's mixed background is stressed (4, 5).\u000d\u000a      Couples whose approaches differed are not necessarily in conflict. For\u000d\u000a        some, divergent approaches are complementary. Others see difficulties\u000d\u000a        between them as humanistic, political or personality choices (4, 5).\u000d\u000a      Supportive or constraining resources and relationships for parents'\u000d\u000a        ability to create a sense of belonging include neighbourhoods, schools,\u000d\u000a        and grandparents. What is supportive for some can be a drawback for\u000d\u000a        others, depending on context (3, 4, 5).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The above research findings have significant implications for helping\u000d\u000a      mixed race families and associated support agencies to understand, address\u000d\u000a      and resolve relationship and social ethnicity-related issues.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43763","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Coppock's original research has directly impacted children's workforce\u000a      development strategy in England, providing the intellectual and empirical\u000a      underpinning for the development of a one-day training course for\u000a      practitioners - Mad, Bad or Misunderstood? Interactive Multimedia\u000a        Training for Professionals Working with Children and Young People in\u000a        Liverpool (MBM Training). The impact began in Liverpool 2005,\u000a      extended to the North West region in 2008, nationally in England from\u000a      2009, and is ongoing.\u000a    In 2005, Coppock was approached by Corroborator 3 for permission to use\u000a      her original research `Mad, Bad or Misunderstood?' as the basis of\u000a      a collaborative project to develop mental health awareness training for\u000a      children and young people's practitioners in Liverpool. The intention was\u000a      to mainstream the core messages from her original research into the\u000a      practice arena - specifically, the need to challenge stereotyping and\u000a      pathologising practices with children and young people; to understand\u000a      children and young people's behaviours as a form of communicating their\u000a      distress; and to develop new skills of listening and responding to\u000a      children and young people in distress (Corroborator 3).\u000a    Coppock acted as a Consultant\/Adviser for the project (along with\u000a      personnel from Liverpool Mental Health Awareness and Liverpool\u000a      CAMHS\/Children's Services Partnership). MBM Training launched in May 2006,\u000a      training 1,000 participants in its first year (Corroborator 1) and was\u000a      profiled in The Guardian (Tickle, 2007) and Young People Now\u000a      (Lloyd, 2007) featuring interviews with Coppock in 2007 on the challenges\u000a      of Every Child Matters vis-&#224;-vis children's workforce development\u000a      needs. Both features highlighted the development of MBM Training as an\u000a      exemplar of good practice.\u000a    MBM Training draws directly on the theoretical framework, analysis and\u000a      practical insights from Coppock's original research (outlined in 2 above:\u000a      Corroborator 1). Specifically, it encourages practitioners to develop\u000a      child-centred understandings of mental distress and place the needs of\u000a      children and young people at the centre of their service. In particular,\u000a      they are asked to consider the popular assumptions that lead to\u000a      pathologising the challenging behaviour of children and young people as\u000a      `mad' or `bad'.

(Page\u000a      17)\u000a    A core philosophy and aim of MBM is that all those who work with children\u000a      and young people should have access to mental health awareness training.\u000a      This is rooted in Coppock's research finding that, when asked, children\u000a      and young people say they prefer to seek and receive support in the\u000a      ordinary, everyday contexts of their lives. MBM's reach to professionals\u000a      and volunteers across a wide range of contexts is testament to its success\u000a      in meeting that core aim. For example, the 317 professionals who completed\u000a      MBM Training via 18 courses delivered by MYA between 1 April 2012 and 31\u000a      March 2013 included social workers from both children's and adult\u000a      services, teachers and allied education practitioners (primary, secondary\u000a      and special needs), child health practitioners, CAMHS workers, Connexions\u000a      workers, youth workers, Children's Centre practitioners, housing officers,\u000a      volunteers and community football coaches (Corroborator 2).\u000a    MYA undertakes evaluation exercises for each cohort attending the\u000a      programme, providing a rich source of evidence on its positive impact on\u000a      the mental health awareness of participants and their attitudes towards\u000a      children and young people in distress. Corroborator 2 comments: \"Over the\u000a      past two years that I have been delivering MBM I have seen first-hand the\u000a      enjoyment, skill, knowledge and confidence of its participants grow. It\u000a      seems to re-ignite a passion within to support, nurture and care for those\u000a      who need it - especially our young people\".\u000a    Illustrative feedback from MBM participants (Corroborator 2) confirms\u000a      this observation. Practitioners commented: \"It has enhanced my awareness\u000a      that can be used in my job and cascaded down to team members\"; \"We need to\u000a      look at the child in context of their wider environment, not labelling\";\u000a      \"It has given me an understanding of looking at behaviours as a small part\u000a      of what may be a bigger problem\".\u000a    Young people involved in the delivery of MBM commented: \"As young people\u000a      we spend the majority of our time in school, surely it's there that things\u000a      should be recognised and picked up on. MBM highlights this to those taking\u000a      part and shows how important it is to listen\"; \"I would like to think that\u000a      doing this means no other young person has the same experiences I had\u000a      during college\". Beyond Merseyside, MBM Training has received both\u000a      regional and national recognition as best practice. For example, the North\u000a      West Centre of Excellence rolled out MBM Training throughout the region\u000a      via a `Train the Trainers' approach, with a print run of 33,000 MBM\u000a      Training Manuals and DVDs disseminated (Corroborators 1 and 3). The\u000a      training has also been used in many of the national Department for\u000a      Education `Targeted Mental Health in Schools' (TaMHS) Programmes - including primary, secondary and special educational needs schools\u000a      (Corroborators 1 and 2)\u000a    MBM Training has also achieved national recognition as an important tool\u000a      in tackling stigma (Barham &amp; Smith, 2011; www.chimat.org.uk\/tacklingstigma\/liverpool).\u000a      The Child and Maternal Health Observatory (ChiMat) promotes MBM Training -\u000a      the manual is available to download directly from its Knowledge Hub\u000a      Resources Database\u000a      (www.chimat.org.uk\/resource\/item.aspx?RID=96510)\u000a      (795 downloads between January 2009 and 31 July 2013).\u000a    Demand for MBM Training continues to be strong and its core content\u000a      remains grounded in Coppock's research. It has also influenced the\u000a      development of programmes such as: `Inside Out', a `follow-on' Level 4\u000a      accredited programme that builds on the themes of MBM Training; the `PEER\u000a      schools award', a quality award that begins with staff training based on\u000a      MBM with the aim of working towards achieving a whole school approach to\u000a      mental health; CAMHS master classes based on the core ideas from MBM\u000a      (Corroborator 2).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Coppock's original research has impacted upon children's workforce\u000a      development strategy and child\/adolescent mental health services in\u000a      England - specifically in workforce up-skilling to provide inclusive,\u000a      child-centred mental health services.

Over 45 people participated during which\u000d\u000a      a number of key strategic and policy questions and options for the Sector\u000d\u000a      were examined. These included: the consequences of the Comprehensive\u000d\u000a      Spending Review in the autumn of 2010; the implications of the Big Society\u000d\u000a      initiative; the closures within the sector and the political options as\u000d\u000a      the preparation for the 2015 General Election were underway. Diamond's use\u000d\u000a      of a participatory approach to the process during the negotiations for the\u000d\u000a      event provided a clear and systematic framework for a critical reflection\u000d\u000a      by the participants on the changing political context and its implications\u000d\u000a      for them professionally and personally.\u000d\u000a    Specifically, the impact of his work on local, regional and national\u000d\u000a      civil society agencies and leaders can be evidenced in the following ways:\u000d\u000a      the regional lead for the VCS in the North West describes Diamond's work\u000d\u000a      thus: \"This collaboration (between VSNW and Diamond) is, perhaps, better\u000d\u000a      illustrated in a series of invitation-only round table events VSNW and the\u000d\u000a      University have convened since 2010. The economic crisis, the outcome of\u000d\u000a      the General Election and the impact of the spending cuts on the sector led\u000d\u000a      us to think about organising a series of structured events in which\u000d\u000a      leading members of the sector could meet to reflect on what the scale of\u000d\u000a      the changes were...These roundtable events have played an important part\u000d\u000a      in my (and our) critical reflection on the strategic objectives of the\u000d\u000a      sector in a real time of change and where we have been able to draw on the\u000d\u000a      skills of someone who...understands our needs.\" (FS 1; additional material\u000d\u000a      FS 4).\u000d\u000a    Impact 2: Setting up, organising, convening and leading a Leadership\u000d\u000a        and Development Group for managers in the VCS across the North West\u000d\u000a        (2010 &#8212; present)\u000d\u000a    Diamond seeks to make connections between his research and his analysis\u000d\u000a      of the nature of how professional power is constructed and enacted in\u000d\u000a      practice and the experiential learning and analysis undertaken by\u000d\u000a      professionals and practitioners themselves. These relationships are,\u000d\u000a      often, contested and demonstrate sites of conflict within professional\u000d\u000a      agencies and between different professional agencies. His work in setting\u000d\u000a      up a Leadership Group in 2012, funded partly through the TLI, with\u000d\u000a      managers and practitioners in Lancashire and from across the North West\u000d\u000a      provided an opportunity for personal and professional learning and\u000d\u000a      development. His approach was, also, to place their work in the context of\u000d\u000a      their organisations so that there were explicit attempts to link their\u000d\u000a      personal learning with the changing needs of their agencies. The agencies\u000d\u000a      included county-wide infrastructure organisations, domestic violence\u000d\u000a      services, equality &amp; diversity agencies, networks to support social\u000d\u000a      enterprises, trustees and management committee members (FS 1).\u000d\u000a    Impact 3: Impact on the development of services for children and young\u000d\u000a        people\u000d\u000a    In 2011 and 2012 Diamond was asked by the North West Regional Youth Work\u000d\u000a      Unit (NWRYWU) to facilitate a day's reflection for senior managers\u000d\u000a      following the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) and to participate in\u000d\u000a      the NWRRYWU's regional parliament for young people on the theme of the\u000d\u000a      cuts and austerity. An indicator of his reputation and credibility is\u000d\u000a      reflected in his being asked to provide a summing up of the day for\u000d\u000a      participants. These invitations followed his involvement in 2006 with the\u000d\u000a      writing of \"Words Matter: A Glossary for Practitioners\" which he undertook\u000d\u000a      in cooperation with a group of senior practitioners from across the North\u000d\u000a      West. These relationships, which led to publications referenced above and\u000d\u000a      informed practice, were only possible because of the levels of trust and\u000d\u000a      confidence he had established with these professional networks. The NWRYWU\u000d\u000a      noted \"(we) drew on John's experience and understanding of what it meant\u000d\u000a      to work `in partnership' with different professional bodies who had little\u000d\u000a      or no understanding of the needs of young people. It is difficult,\u000d\u000a      perhaps, to recognise the dramatic changes in the way services for\u000d\u000a      children and young people were being organised nearly a decade ago....In\u000d\u000a      our work with John we were able to develop a clearer sense of how to frame\u000d\u000a      our conversations with other key agencies and there is no doubt that\u000d\u000a      members of our network gained from their involvement too.\" (FS 2).\u000d\u000a    Impact 4: Working with one of the London Community Empowerment\u000d\u000a        Networks (2003-08)\u000d\u000a    As his work with one of the London Community Empowerment Networks\u000d\u000a      confirms, working with different professional groups as well as users and\u000d\u000a      residents requires broad conceptual as well as people-based skills (his\u000d\u000a      participation in the work in Lewisham directly followed a seminar at South\u000d\u000a      Bank University where he drew on his 2001 research findings). The CEN lead\u000d\u000a      has noted that \"During his work with us he was asked to run a number of\u000d\u000a      day events for practitioners across the Authority. These were successful\u000d\u000a      and in them he focussed on engaging with participants to think about and\u000d\u000a      to reflect on the values, aims and practice of community work. I would\u000d\u000a      estimate that about 65 participants from across Lewisham took part in\u000d\u000a      these sessions [...] We drew on his skills as an academic, a researcher\u000d\u000a      and someone who was able to cut across the different professional\u000d\u000a      boundaries between university and practice.\" (FS 3). The programme was\u000d\u000a      organised as a way of enhancing the skills and capacities of both\u000d\u000a      professionals and residents who were involved in some aspects of community\u000d\u000a      development practice. The same lead observed, \"As part of the formal LCN\u000d\u000a      evaluation he made a number of specific recommendations. These included a\u000d\u000a      much more explicit approach towards equality and diversity which led,\u000d\u000a      amongst other things, to the creation of an Equalities Officer post within\u000d\u000a      the LCN.\"\u000d\u000a    Impact 5: Acting as a critical friend to senior policy makers (2012\u000d\u000a        and on-going)\u000d\u000a    Since autumn 2012, Diamond supported one of the senior policy leads in\u000d\u000a      one of the North West's former police authorities. His work here which was\u000d\u000a      asked for on the basis of reputation confirms his ability to work\u000d\u000a      sensitively with colleagues in highly politically sensitive roles as well\u000d\u000a      as his knowledge of and insights into the organisational and political\u000d\u000a      context to the reforms introduced. He has the ability to develop\u000d\u000a      confidence in him by those he works with and to work through difficult\u000d\u000a      (sometimes on a personal basis) professional and organisationally\u000d\u000a      challenging questions. The officer concerned acknowledges Diamond's role\u000d\u000a      in \"coaching and mentoring to me as a member of the Senior Management Team\u000d\u000a      on: finding a new coping mechanism for significant change; a sounding\u000d\u000a      board and reality check...; an exploration of the new operating context;\u000d\u000a      understanding the change management process including readiness\u000d\u000a      assessments; communication implication and planning; tackling resistance\u000d\u000a      to change and confidence building, assertiveness and personal\u000d\u000a      development.\" (FS 5).\u000d\u000a    The opportunities for learning and for professional (and personal)\u000d\u000a      development in such settings requires skilled and informed facilitation.\u000d\u000a      Diamond's work with practitioners and professionals in a number of\u000d\u000a      different contexts (from workshops to day schools) illustrate the level of\u000d\u000a      confidence in his work by the practitioner communities\/networks. His\u000d\u000a      appointment in 2011 as joint editor of Teaching Public Administration\u000d\u000a      (TPA) is further evidence of the recognition of his work with\u000d\u000a      practitioners and professionals.\u000d\u000a    Impact 6: Improving VCS Leaders and Practitioners' understanding of\u000d\u000a        the Big Society and its implications of the changing political context\u000d\u000a    The impact (especially in the North West) of his work can be seen in how\u000d\u000a      it has enabled leaders and practitioners to make sense of the changed (and\u000d\u000a      changing) relationships of the VCS to other public sector agencies and\u000d\u000a      organisations; the changing political context and the restructuring of the\u000d\u000a      market, state and role of civil society. His contribution is, also, about\u000d\u000a      how to learn more systematically from these changes and so anticipate\u000d\u000a      future developments and (where possible) influence the professional and\u000d\u000a      practice informed discussions and reflections. Through his work with TPA,\u000d\u000a      the blogs he contributes to, the national and international networks he is\u000d\u000a      part of and the work he is engaged with to promote a more systematic\u000d\u000a      approach to learning, Diamond makes connections between the local, the\u000d\u000a      national and international. The blog Diamond contributed to during 2010 - 2012 was seen as significant by a number of professionals and\u000d\u000a      practitioners in the VCS. (As one senior officer has noted: \"His analysis\u000d\u000a      of the Cameron concept of the Big Society just after the 2010 Election was\u000d\u000a      very valuable. There were not that many academics writing about it in the\u000d\u000a      way he did (critical of the idea but able to explain it to a wide and\u000d\u000a      diverse audience) and which also spoke to the voluntary sector [...] His\u000d\u000a      work represents an important resource for us\" (FS 4)). In the autumn of\u000d\u000a      2010 he was one of 28 people invited to an invitation only event of\u000d\u000a      opinion formers (including national press columnists) hosted by the Joseph\u000d\u000a      Rowntree Foundation (OS 2). Diamond was the only academic and the\u000d\u000a      invitation came because of his blog. The purpose of the event was to\u000d\u000a      provide the JRF's Chief Executive and her senior policy team with an\u000d\u000a      analysis of the likely impact of the Cameron concept of the Big Society.\u000d\u000a      JRF were then going to convene a panel of academics for a similar\u000d\u000a      discussion.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Diamond's research paper (Diamond 2001) on the management of change\u000d\u000a      within major urban regeneration programmes directly led to him working\u000d\u000a      with Voluntary and Community Sector organisations in South London (2003 -\u000d\u000a      08); regional VCS networks in the North West (2008 &#8212; present); the\u000d\u000a      Leadership and Development group of VCS leaders in the North West (2010 &#8212;\u000d\u000a      present) and national VCS organisations (2005 &#8212; present).

The idea that the\u000d\u000a      `decentralisation' of services plus `cross boundary' working by\u000d\u000a      practitioners and professionals would lead to the `democratisation' of\u000d\u000a      services was contested by Diamond in field work in Manchester in the late\u000d\u000a      1980s (Diamond 2001). From 2001 he set out his critique of such approaches\u000d\u000a      and the case for change and innovation in professional education and\u000d\u000a      training (Diamond 2007). In subsequent primary research (Diamond 2012), he\u000d\u000a      has examined models of leadership and leadership education present within\u000d\u000a      the VCS. This empirical work was influenced by his extensive experience of\u000d\u000a      undertaking funded evaluations of regeneration initiatives and the setting\u000d\u000a      up of the Community Empowerment Networks from 2002 onwards. His\u000d\u000a      involvement as an external, independent and critical friend to a number of\u000d\u000a      local, regional and national networks is evidence of his reputation and\u000d\u000a      the importance he attaches to personal and professional education and\u000d\u000a      learning (local networks, regional ones &#8212; Voluntary Sector North West,\u000d\u000a      North West Regional Youth Work Unit &#8212; and national ones such as the\u000d\u000a      National Coalition for Independent Action, Voluntary Sector Studies\u000d\u000a      Network). Through these different networks he has worked with over 800\u000d\u000a      practitioners \/ activists from the VCS and public agencies.\u000d\u000a    Diamond's work explored the ways in which public policy initiatives were\u000d\u000a      often seen as attempts to develop `joined-up' working at the planning\u000d\u000a      stage but became discrete or competing projects at the implementation\u000d\u000a      phase.

In particular, he was very\u000d\u000a      critical of the New Labour model of `partnership' and the incorporation of\u000d\u000a      the VCS into the role or place of state funded agencies (Diamond 2010 and\u000d\u000a      Diamond and Pearce 2010).

Funded by\u000d\u000a      the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust\u000d\u000a      (&#163;9k) the work of the symposium was rooted in the ethos of grassroots\u000d\u000a      truth recovery and earlier\u000d\u000a      research and engagement. A published report (2010) was disseminated via\u000d\u000a      the websites of\u000d\u000a      several organisations (i.e. CagePrisoners, IHRC, CAJ) and\u000d\u000a      of the leading London-based anti-\u000d\u000a      racist think tank, the Institute of Race Relations (IRR).

According to the 2011 census data, this\u000a      state of Australia has a population of 2,239,170, 3.1% (69,664) of which\u000a      are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, with languages spoken at\u000a      home other than English including Mandarin (1.3%), Cantonese (0.8%),\u000a      Vietnamese (0.7%), and Arabic (0.5%). Although the focus of the SEU is on\u000a      `race', intersecting characteristics such as gender, disability, age, and\u000a      geographical location or isolation are equally important factors\u000a      considered by it. The initial input by Husband was to develop an agreed\u000a      theoretical framework for an understanding of the nature of the sources\u000a      and forms of discrimination likely to be in operation; and to develop an\u000a      agreed policy framework for addressing this in relation to the delivery of\u000a      services by all departments of the Government. In this he drew on his\u000a      academic studies of racism and discrimination in relation to media\u000a      practice, social work services, nursing, and the wider politics of\u000a      national policy development around `multiculturalism'. This translated\u000a      into sensitivity towards the particular expression of multiculturalism in\u000a      the context of the distinctive history of Australian identity and\u000a      politics.\u000a    A key issue was to agree upon the centrality of `institutional racism',\u000a      since this placed the focus on changing institutional behaviours,\u000a      institutional practice, and managerial values rather than upon individual\u000a      prejudice. In the context of Australia with its self-image as a successful\u000a      multi-ethnic society characterised by its commitment to `a fair go', this\u000a      perspective was not entirely welcome. Thus an initial key activity was to\u000a      carry through a programme of education for key policy makers and\u000a      practitioners about the perspectives they held on the legitimacy of\u000a      addressing state institutional practice. Given the emphasis in Husband's\u000a      work on valuing difference, theoretically a major breakthrough was in\u000a      gaining a shared understanding of what `equal treatment' might mean, and\u000a      in this regard the use of the phrase \"If you want to treat me equally\u000a        you might have to be prepared to treat me differently\", was key.\u000a      Practically, the development and use of `Needs and Impact Assessment'\u000a      tools as a vehicle for levering change was also crucial. The structure for\u000a      the implementation of this new policy was deliberately designed to be\u000a      gradualist and cumulative, and is clearly laid out in the Unit's\u000a      documentation. This structure is still in place as an on-going, long-term\u000a      framework of the SEU in its work to shape the policies of specific\u000a      government departments and positively affect the quality and accessibility\u000a      of their services for minorities.\u000a    For example, the 2011-2012 Annual Report notes that: \"Following on\u000a        from its initial education stages engaging CEOs, Senior Officers and\u000a        Implementing Officers from the 31 participating WA Government agencies\u000a        (including the Commission), in its sixth year the Substantive Equality\u000a        Unit is now expanding its reach to the wider WA public sector and\u000a        community... Now there is greater understanding of Substantive Equality\u000a        ... and of the one size does not fit all concepts for public sector\u000a        policies and practices, the 31 participating departments are going\u000a        beyond their assessments of existing policies and practices by\u000a        undertaking a Substantive Equality pilot program which involves the\u000a        assessment of new policies and initiatives. In addition to the pilot\u000a        program and the expansion of its work to the community and wider public\u000a        sector, the SEU continues its support work in education, research and\u000a        monitoring with the 31 existing departments.\" (b).\u000a    The education programme was followed by the introduction of impact and\u000a      needs assessments to influence current practice, the format of which can\u000a      be found in the Substantive Equality Guide (2012) (c). An example of how\u000a      these work in practice can be found in the 2011-12 Annual Report (b),\u000a      which shows the SEU continuing its three-year impact study with the\u000a      Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages to further research the\u000a      disproportionate number of Aboriginal Australians without a birth\u000a      certificate. The aim is to quantify the problem and identify the obstacles\u000a      this group faces in accessing the birth registration system: then to\u000a      create culturally appropriate remedies in the birth registry process.\u000a      Additionally, specific reports on interventions show how the impact and\u000a      needs assessments continue to be a key starting point for reviewing\u000a      current practice and making recommendations for systemic change. The\u000a      report of the Disability Services Commission (2011) (d) &#8212; Substantive\u000a      Equality Unit Project No 4, Positive Behaviour Teams &#8212; details the outcome\u000a      of an examination of the teams within the State-wide Specialist Services\u000a      Directorate of the Disability Services Commission. Through employing the\u000a      established method of the SEU &#8212; interviewing service users from minority\u000a      backgrounds, agencies who work with them, service workers and other\u000a      concerned parties &#8212; this review provided an examination of the adequacy of\u000a      current practice for meeting the needs of people of Aboriginal and CALD\u000a      (culturally and linguistically diverse) backgrounds. The report identified\u000a      seven areas with specific recommendations for change. The implementation\u000a      of these recommendations will now become a mutual process of dialogue\u000a      between the Disability Services Commission and SEU. At a different level,\u000a      the more specific review of the usage of a public park &#8212; Review of\u000a        Customer Service at Whiteman Park, Department of Planning (e) &#8212;\u000a      revealed `some gaps in the services provided to the parks customers from\u000a      CALD backgrounds.' An identification of these `gaps' resulted in the\u000a      production of 11 recommendations for innovation. Because these\u000a      recommendations were published in 2011-12 there is as yet no evidence as\u000a      to how successfully they were delivered. However, each recommendation was\u000a      attached to a named responsible officer with a stated time frame for\u000a      completion of the innovation, to improve access and usage of the park for\u000a      those from CALD backgrounds.\u000a    Current initiatives being developed by the SEU in partnership with other\u000a      government departments include developing the provision of mobile breast\u000a      screening unit to remote Aboriginal peoples; increasing the percentage of\u000a      Aboriginal people holding drivers licences; and modifying the means of\u000a      communication with Aboriginal and CALD clients.\u000a    The enduring strength of the Substantive Equality Policy lies not only in\u000a      the specific initiatives of the SEU, but also in the way the equality\u000a      policy is influencing the functions, policies and practices of individual\u000a      government departments. For example, in the area of housing, a 2009 report\u000a      of the SEU looked at the experiences of Aboriginal and CALD people in the\u000a      private housing rental market and made 15 recommendations to improve their\u000a      treatment in this sector. These recommendations included training and\u000a      guidelines for industry operators, legislative regulation of tenancy\u000a      databases, national consistency of legislation, and support for CALD and\u000a      Aboriginal people to access and maintain a tenancy (f). A 2011 report on\u000a      the outcomes of these recommendations showed that, while there was still a\u000a      long way to go to achieving equality in the housing market, training for\u000a      industry operators had been set up and operationalised; guidelines had\u000a      been prepared in the form of a booklet drawing the attention of operators\u000a      to the requirements on them in existing equality laws; and legislation\u000a      currently being drafted to regulate tenancy databases takes into account\u000a      the findings of the 2009 report (g). The report on outcomes concludes that,\u000a        \"through the full and partial achievement of the recommendations and\u000a        other initiatives, some of the barriers [for Aboriginal and CALD people\u000a        in the housing market] identified in the original Report will gradually\u000a        be removed.\" (g). Thus the SEU, the establishment and shaping of\u000a      which Husband played such a key role in, continues to impact on the lives\u000a      and opportunities of minority groups living in the province of WA,\u000a      influencing government departments \"to make [their] services better\u000a        tailored to meet the needs of all their clients\" (a). It is helping\u000a      to improve social inclusion in the region by influencing policy and\u000a      practice in order to increase the accessibility, take-up, and use of\u000a      services by people from minority backgrounds.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    One of the main impacts of Bradford's ethnicity research is its influence\u000a      on how the Substantive Equality Unit (SEU) was set up and continues to\u000a      operate within the Equal Opportunities Commission of Western Australia.\u000a      The SEU was established to address the challenge of creating equal and\u000a      inclusive services, and ensuring their delivery, by all the departments of\u000a      the Western Australian government for a diverse population.

A significant feature of the Unit's\u000a      approach, which is now encompassed in the diversity and identity group\u000a      within the Centre for Applied Social Research, is the way it relates\u000a      theory and empirical research on race and ethnicity with a critical\u000a      approach to social policy; the overall aim of which is a more equitable\u000a      reshaping of civil society. The cumulative body of work by Husband is an\u000a      exemplar of this research, resulting in extensive publications on ethnic\u000a      relations that have explicit policy relevance locally, nationally, and\u000a      internationally. His research has analysed the nature of ethnic relations\u000a      in Britain and across Europe, arguing for a multicultural public sphere\u000a      and forms of citizenship in which there is respect for cultural and ethnic\u000a      difference, critiquing the drift in current political rhetoric and in\u000a      certain social policies towards assimilationist models, the ideal of which\u000a      is to absorb minorities into the dominant culture (1,4). This has meant\u000a      that empirical work has been engaged in developing tools that will create\u000a      greater appreciation of differences within agencies operating in the\u000a      public sphere, thus improving both the quality and inclusiveness of\u000a      services for minority groups. For example, through research funded by the\u000a      English National Board of Nursing and Midwifery, tools were developed to\u000a      improve transcultural understanding and communication in nursing\u000a      education, thus having impacts on the way nursing services are delivered\u000a      to diverse groups (2,3). Developments were also made in\u000a      anti-discriminatory social work practice and in research on the way\u000a      ethnicity is represented in mainstream and minority ethnic media (5). The\u000a      approach of this research is interdisciplinary, developing a concern with\u000a      the contextual framework of human rights and law in the shaping of policy\u000a      in multi-ethnic societies (4).\u000a    In the application of this research Husband has worked with NGOs,\u000a      government departments, and individual activists with an ambition to\u000a      improve inter-ethnic relations at the level of state institutions,\u000a      professional practice, and interpersonal relations. Particularly, this has\u000a      provided a strong evidential basis for developing a gradualist approach to\u000a      creating change in routine professional practices within government\u000a      agencies. Previous observation of over-zealous interventions provided\u000a      evidence of the dangers of offending potential allies, while stiffening\u000a      the resistance of entrenched enemies of change. This experience has been\u000a      central in informing Husband's role in Western Australia (WA). In the late\u000a      1980s Husband was invited to be a consultant with the Multicultural and\u000a      Ethnic Affairs Commission of WA, and then a Visiting Fellow at the\u000a      University of Western Australia, resulting in a book (1) which was written\u000a      in response to requests from colleagues in that University. The\u000a      significance of the book is that it gives a wide-ranging account of ethnic\u000a      diversity and of the challenge of addressing diversity, which, while\u000a      reflecting on the British experience, contributed to his visibility in WA\u000a      political circles as an expert in race relations. It also provided a\u000a      transparent understanding of the policy approach that would eventually be\u000a      developed through the Substantive Equality Unit (SEU). He subsequently had\u000a      visiting lecturer status at Curtin University over a number of years and\u000a      was active in the debate around Australian multiculturalism. In the period\u000a      2004-5 Husband, supported by the Commissioner, the Hon. Yvonne Henderson,\u000a      was given the lead in developing the Substantive Equality Policy across\u000a      all the departments of the Government of WA and its organisational\u000a      structure. Working with a small team, he had a key role in negotiating the\u000a      political process of bringing the SEU into existence.\u000a    Thus the invitation to work with the Government of WA came as a result of\u000a      the international profile of Bradford's research on race and ethnicity,\u000a      and in particular of Husband's reputation within the academic and policy\u000a      milieu as having expertise not only as an academic empirical researcher,\u000a      but also importantly as having successfully engaged in developing policy\u000a      responses to diversity in fields such as journalism, nursing, and social\u000a      work; and who had worked with cognate professional bodies in the United\u000a      Kingdom, Europe and Australia.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43965","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The pilot and follow on research has had a significant and enduring\u000d\u000a      transformative impact on the\u000d\u000a      development of national and local policies which guide the response to\u000d\u000a      diversity in the 124 prisons\u000d\u000a      of England and Wales. These significant enhancements to policy and\u000d\u000a      practice were enabled by\u000d\u000a      the creation of Executive Steering Groups for both research projects\u000d\u000a      (a,b). Constituted by key,\u000d\u000a      national and local, policy stakeholders these groups facilitated\u000d\u000a      engagement with and\u000d\u000a      understanding of research findings as they emerged, enabling rapid uptake\u000d\u000a      and response at a\u000d\u000a      policy level (c,d).\u000d\u000a    The substantial reach of impacts arising from the pilot research is\u000d\u000a      attested to by the Head of\u000d\u000a      NOMS Equalities Group (the policy unit for diversity issues) who\u000d\u000a      commissioned copies of the\u000d\u000a      research report for distribution across the entire prison estate and\u000d\u000a      confirms its impact in shaping\u000d\u000a      the national equalities framework policy launched in 2011 (c,d). This\u000d\u000a      impact on policy was further\u000d\u000a      extended within the High Security estate by the researchers' direct\u000d\u000a      engagement of prison\u000d\u000a      governors responsible for managing diversity in their own establishments.\u000d\u000a    The enduring impact of the pilot research is evidenced by NOMS subsequent\u000d\u000a      decision making.\u000d\u000a      For example, in 2010, NOMS Equalities Group adopted a key recommendation\u000d\u000a      of the research;\u000d\u000a      that there should be greater prisoner consultation when developing\u000d\u000a      guidance for prison staff about\u000d\u000a      diversity. The significance of adopting this recommendation for prison\u000d\u000a      stakeholders nationally, is\u000d\u000a      attested to by the Head of Equalities Group (c,d) and locally, by the\u000d\u000a      Governing Governor of the\u000d\u000a      pilot prison (e,f). Both sources highlight benefits to prison staff in\u000d\u000a      terms of improved support and\u000d\u000a      subsequent confidence in responding appropriately and effectively to\u000d\u000a      diversity issues and indirect\u000d\u000a      benefits to prisoners through their lived experience of staff responses to\u000d\u000a      them.\u000d\u000a    The Head of Equalities group also attests that the conclusion of the\u000d\u000a      research that AI is a\u000d\u000a      methodology effective in engaging prisoners and staff in the often\u000d\u000a      negatively focussed prison\u000d\u000a      environment impacted their decision making when commissioning future\u000d\u000a      research. For example,\u000d\u000a      the decision by NOMS to commission NACRO (National Association for the\u000d\u000a      Care and\u000d\u000a      Rehabilitation of Offenders) to adopt a similar approach in the design of\u000d\u000a      equality impact\u000d\u000a      assessment and to produce improved guidance for prison staff to enable\u000d\u000a      them to more effectively\u000d\u000a      undertake prisoner consultation (c,d).\u000d\u000a    Drawing on other findings of the research, NOMS also commissioned good\u000d\u000a      practice guidance and\u000d\u000a      a national training package for prisoner equalities representatives and\u000d\u000a      developed mediatory rather\u000d\u000a      than adversarial methods for dealing with complaints relating to diversity\u000d\u000a      issues (c,d). The\u000d\u000a      importance to NOMS of being able to demonstrate the significance of these\u000d\u000a      impacts in terms of\u000d\u000a      the benefits they have generated for individual prisons, staff and\u000d\u000a      prisoners is evidenced by their\u000d\u000a      commitment to and collaboration with the third ESRC funded research\u000d\u000a      project currently being\u000d\u000a      undertaken by the University of Bradford team and will form part of our\u000d\u000a      future impact reporting.\u000d\u000a    The reach of impact extends beyond policy to improvements for\u000d\u000a      practitioners and prison service\u000d\u000a      professionals. For example, prior to the pilot research, prisoners\u000d\u000a      reported race related inequality\u000d\u000a      via the RIRF system (Racial Incident Reporting Form). However, there was\u000d\u000a      no mechanism to\u000d\u000a      report other forms of diversity related inequality. The pilot research\u000d\u000a      recommended this system be\u000d\u000a      changed to a DIRF (Discrimination Incident Reporting Form) (a). This\u000d\u000a      recommendation was\u000d\u000a      subsequently adopted and is incorporated in the national PSI-32 issued\u000d\u000a      14.04.2011 (g). The reach\u000d\u000a      and significance of this impact is extensive since the DIRF remains the only\u000d\u000a      mechanism that the\u000d\u000a      80,193 prisoners from all protected minorities (NOMS, March 2012) have to\u000d\u000a      report inequality and\u000d\u000a      discrimination they are experiencing. The research also highlighted that\u000d\u000a      prisoners preferred non-adversarial\u000d\u000a      methods of resolving issues relating to diversity and inequality (a). This\u000d\u000a      confirmed to\u000d\u000a      NOMS the importance of face-to-face interactions between staff and\u000d\u000a      prisoners in ensuring fairness\u000d\u000a      in prisons and influenced its decision to introduce structured\u000d\u000a      communications techniques in the\u000d\u000a      prison setting (c,d).\u000d\u000a    The follow on research also generated impacts which had both local\u000d\u000a      significance and national\u000d\u000a      reach and significance. The research was delivered via a series of\u000d\u000a      innovative, knowledge\u000d\u000a      exchange workshops where prison staff and\/or prisoners worked with\u000d\u000a      diversity experts.\u000d\u000a    The research influenced the development of reference guides to assist\u000d\u000a      staff in respecting diversity\u000d\u000a      when searching prisoners. The Governing Governor of the pilot prison has\u000d\u000a      described how an audit\u000d\u000a      of security searching subsequent to the workshop demonstrated improved\u000d\u000a      staff confidence in\u000d\u000a      searching prisoners from diverse minorities (f). Whilst this demonstrates\u000d\u000a      a direct benefit to staff, it\u000d\u000a      also benefits prisoners through more dignified and respectful searching of\u000d\u000a      their person and\u000d\u000a      belongings. A second workshop was undertaken with prisoners who were\u000d\u000a      working as\u000d\u000a      representatives for diversity on their residential wings. The workshop\u000d\u000a      developed the\u000d\u000a      representatives' appreciation of the intersectional nature of diversity\u000d\u000a      and encouraged them to\u000d\u000a      develop strategies for supporting others which moved beyond their previous\u000d\u000a      focus on singular\u000d\u000a      strands of diversity. Subsequently, the representatives used this\u000d\u000a      understanding to produce and\u000d\u000a      implement a training package to help new prisoner diversity\u000d\u000a      representatives understand diversity\u000d\u000a      from an intersectional perspective. This training package has been shared\u000d\u000a      with all eight prisons\u000d\u000a      within the High Security Estate benefitting diversity representatives and\u000d\u000a      those diverse minority\u000d\u000a      prisoners they support.\u000d\u000a    Wider, national reach and significance were generated by a final workshop\u000d\u000a      which focussed on the\u000d\u000a      development of policy and practice relating to prisoner sexuality, in\u000d\u000a      particular transgender.\u000d\u000a      Learning arising from this workshop was subsequently incorporated into\u000d\u000a      training materials for the\u000d\u000a      management of transsexual prisoners by the National Prison Service trainer\u000d\u000a      who attended the\u000d\u000a      workshop (h). This enabled transmission of the learning across the local\u000d\u000a      and wider national\u000d\u000a      workforce. The same workshop impacted on the creation of a local policy\u000d\u000a      for the management of\u000d\u000a      transgender prisoners which was subsequently shared between prisons within\u000d\u000a      the High Security\u000d\u000a      estate (e,f). This local policy was significant as, at that time, a\u000d\u000a      national policy had not yet been\u000d\u000a      released (i). Beneficiaries of this policy included transgender prisoners\u000d\u000a      at the local prison and\u000d\u000a      subsequently in the wider High Security estate and the prison staff\u000d\u000a      responsible for their care by\u000d\u000a      providing clarity about respectful and decent treatment of transgender\u000d\u000a      offenders in terms of access\u000d\u000a      to facilities, personal searching techniques, and the rights and\u000d\u000a      responsibilities of both staff and\u000d\u000a      transgender offenders.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research carried out at the University of Bradford has directly and\u000d\u000a      indirectly influenced how\u000d\u000a      prisons in England and Wales respond to issues of diversity and\u000d\u000a      equalities; consequently\u000d\u000a      impacting the lived experience of those working and residing in prisons.\u000d\u000a      The research has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the development of a national equalities policy framework;\u000d\u000a      the development of new\u000d\u000a      national and local policies and guidance for the care and management of\u000d\u000a      transgender offenders;\u000d\u000a      revisions to and widening of the mechanisms for prisoner reporting and\u000d\u000a      investigation of\u000d\u000a      discrimination and inequality, and the development of human capital\u000d\u000a      through a more equalities\u000d\u000a      literate workforce and prisoner population.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bradford\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bradford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bradford","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007785}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

The research\u000d\u000a      continues at the University of Bradford extending into a three year\u000d\u000a      ESRC-funded grant (Lavis, 2013-2016).\u000d\u000a      Prior to this research, little was known about the response or\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of prisons to\u000d\u000a      issues of diversity. National Offender Management Service (NOMS) policy\u000d\u000a      and practice had been\u000d\u000a      shaped in response to the racist murder of Zahid Mubarek in Feltham Young\u000d\u000a      Offenders Institution\u000d\u000a      in 2000 and the subsequent finding of the Commission for Racial Equalities\u000d\u000a      (2003) that NOMS was\u000d\u000a      in breach of its legal obligations. Policy and practice therefore focussed\u000d\u000a      almost exclusively on\u000d\u000a      race\/ethnicity and failed to capture the breadth of inequalities\u000d\u000a      experienced by other diverse\u000d\u000a      minorities. Lavis, Cowburn and Walker (1,2) highlighted this omission,\u000d\u000a      specifically in relation to\u000d\u000a      offending behaviour programmes. In 2008 Lavis and Cowburn developed\u000d\u000a      collaborations with the\u000d\u000a      equalities policy making body of NOMS; the Race Equality Action Group; the\u000d\u000a      Diversity Manager of\u000d\u000a      a High Security prison and prisoners representing wider strands of\u000d\u000a      diversity including age,\u000d\u000a      disability, sexual orientation, transgender, religion\/belief, and\u000d\u000a      race\/ethnicity (3). These\u000d\u000a      collaborations informed the development of three ESRC-funded research\u000d\u000a      projects, enabling the\u000d\u000a      knowledge generated to impact directly into NOMS national policy\u000d\u000a      development and local policy\u000d\u000a      and practice.\u000d\u000a    The 2009\/10 pilot research (4), explored how diversity was responded to\u000d\u000a      in prison and crucially,\u000d\u000a      developed and tested the first methodology for assessing this response.\u000d\u000a      The methodology,\u000d\u000a      subsequently noted by ESRC reviewers as `innovative' and `creative',\u000d\u000a      assessed the suitability of an\u000d\u000a      Appreciative Inquiry (AI) informed approach. The research challenged\u000d\u000a      assumptions, raised in\u000d\u000a      research literature, that the focus of AI on identifying `life at its\u000d\u000a      best' as the starting point of any\u000d\u000a      inquiry might prevent discovery of the negative aspects of prison life.\u000d\u000a      The pilot demonstrated this\u000d\u000a      concern was invalid, illustrating that AI identifies strengths and\u000d\u000a      weaknesses, whilst actively\u000d\u000a      engaging the interest and involvement of prisoners, prison staff and\u000d\u000a      senior prison management (5).\u000d\u000a      The research also generated alternate ways of theorising diversity in\u000d\u000a      prisons, highlighting the\u000d\u000a      significance of `intersectionality' as a way of understanding how people\u000d\u000a      experience prison life (5,6).\u000d\u000a      Previously, theorising of diversity and inequality in prisons had\u000d\u000a      primarily focussed on only one\u000d\u000a      aspect of personhood (e.g. ethnicity) rather than how aspects of\u000d\u000a      personhood intersect in the\u000d\u000a      individual (e.g. age, sexuality and disability) contributing to the\u000d\u000a      political, social and economic\u000d\u000a      dynamics of oppression and inequality. The 2010\/11 research (5) targeted\u000d\u000a      three specific areas of\u000d\u000a      responding to diversity identified in the 2009 pilot: sensitivity to\u000d\u000a      equality in security searching; the\u000d\u000a      management of transgender prisoners; and the training of prisoner\u000d\u000a      diversity representatives in the\u000d\u000a      intersectional nature of diversity. An innovative workshop based approach\u000d\u000a      was developed\u000d\u000a      enabling, for the first time, policy advisors, national trainers, academic\u000d\u000a      researchers, prison staff and\u000d\u000a      prisoners to work together. The value of the underpinning research to the\u000d\u000a      field is highlighted by the\u000d\u000a      decision of the ESRC in January 2013 to fund a new multi-site research\u000d\u000a      project, incorporating both\u000d\u000a      public and private sector prisons. This work, already underway, extends\u000d\u000a      and develops the\u000d\u000a      methodological and theoretical enhancements of the underlying research, to\u000d\u000a      generate a detailed,\u000d\u000a      critical understanding of how UK prisons respond to diversity.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44125","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has been contributing to policy development over a lengthy\u000a      period. In this case study, we focus on impact from 2008 onwards.\u000a    The `reach' of the impact has been substantial: the research findings\u000a      have played a significant role in ensuring better informed public\u000a      policy-making in the field of personal care provision in Scotland,\u000a      England, Wales and Northern Ireland, leading to direct changes in policy\u000a      (detailed below). As a guideline to the numbers of people affected by the\u000a      research findings and the related policies, 33,000 older people received\u000a      FPC in Scotland in 2003-4 and by 2011-12 this had risen to 46,000, with\u000a      costs of &#163;342m. This population also shows increasingly high levels of\u000a      need, from 7 hours per week to 8 hours over the same period9 In\u000a      addition, the impact has achieved international reach, through the World\u000a      Demographic Association in Switzerland and via work contributing to a\u000a      Russell Sage foundation publication led by Syracuse University's Maxwell\u000a      School of Citizenship, which aimed to influence implementation of the\u000a      CLASS Act USA (Community Living Assistance Services and Supports) in the\u000a      USA (the CLASS Act was eventually withdrawn by the Obama administration in\u000a      October 2011). Influential stakeholders including LeadingAge, the Urban\u000a      Institute, AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons),\u000a      United Hospital Fund NYC and Thomson Reuters were co-contributors. The\u000a      published volume continues to contribute to the debate through the Russell\u000a      Sage Foundation's commitment to `the improvement of social and living\u000a      conditions in the United States'10.\u000a    The `significance' of the research findings has also been substantial.\u000a      The project set out baseline information which enabled the monitoring of\u000a      the FPC policy in Scotland, which was reviewed by Audit Scotland in 200811\u000a      and subsequently cited as evidence in the Sutherland review in 200812,\u000a      of which Bell was a member. This confirmed the all-party commitment to FPC\u000a      in Scotland, despite the rising costs: coverage cited the Stirling\u000a      research as fundamental13.\u000a    The significance of the research findings was felt in the English, Welsh\u000a      and Northern Ireland policy contexts. The research was cited as part of\u000a      the Wanless review of various options for funding social care in 2006,\u000a      which continues to inform debate and has led to the ongoing development of\u000a      long-term care policies in England, including a continuing rejection of\u000a      the Scottish model of FPC in the English context, most recently\u000a      represented in the Dilnot report of 2011 Fairer Care Funding. The\u000a      team contributed input, through JRF events to the `Caring Choices' UK wide\u000a      debates on paying for care which reported in 2008 on `The Future of Care\u000a      Funding'14. This initiative was focused on informing and\u000a      stimulating public debate on the future costs of care and how these should\u000a      be met: the JRF document which fed it (Paying for long term care &#8212;\u000a        moving forward15) cites our research on the lessons of\u000a      the FPC policy.\u000a    The follow-up research on expenditure on domiciliary care in Wales was\u000a      instrumental in the Welsh Assembly's decision not to implement FPC for\u000a      older people in Wales in 200916.

The first project (2004-5), funded by the Joseph Rowntree\u000a      Foundation (JRF), was the first attempt to review the impact of the policy\u000a      of free personal and nursing care (FPC) in Scotland (Community Care and\u000a      Health (Scotland) Act 2002). It involved quantitative and qualitative\u000a      research and compared policies and their impacts across the UK, was\u000a      competitively awarded and peer reviewed at the grant awarding stage. The\u000a      second project (2005) was funded by the Scottish Government &#8212; it collated\u000a      baseline data to establish a benchmark for monitoring the policy, and\u000a      underwent peer review at the grant awarding and project reporting stage.\u000a      The third project (2006) was an update commissioned by JRF which looked at\u000a      trends over a longer time period, and particularly focused on the issues\u000a      faced by local authorities. The team also completed a project for the\u000a      Welsh Assembly government (2006) which collected and analysed detailed\u000a      data on services delivered to older people through Welsh local\u000a      authorities. The research was updated to inform the Sutherland Review of\u000a      FPC (2008), the Audit Scotland review (2008), and the Syracuse symposium\u000a      (2011), funded by the Russell Sage Foundation (USA). Subsequently, further\u000a      research was commissioned by the Scottish Government (2012) (following\u000a      competitive tender) to analyse the costs of care in the context of\u000a      personalisation and self-directed support (elsewhere known as direct\u000a      payments). This research was both quantitative (using large scale data\u000a      sets) and qualitative and included extensive work with service providers,\u000a      older people and family caregivers to collect a range of perspectives: for\u000a      example, the first project involved 20 key informants and 88 older people\u000a      who took part in focus groups. Economic micro simulation modeling was used\u000a      to provide costings, drawing on the OPERA (Older PEople's Resource\u000a      Allocation) model, developed at Stirling by Bowes and Bell in ESRC funded\u000a      work under the Scotland's Demography programme1 (2005-6).\u000a    The research provided analysis of the costs of FPC, which were found not\u000a      to be greatly out of line with costs in the rest of the UK, whilst rising\u000a      due to demographic change and to the shift away from residential towards\u000a      home based care. Qualitatively, the research raised and elucidated a\u000a      number of important issues around FPC including the problematic nature of\u000a      Government guidance, the variable impacts on and strategies adopted by\u000a      local authorities and the variation in value for money when delivering the\u000a      services, the critical role of unpaid (family) care, the lack of\u000a      substitution and the lack of cross-border migration &#8212; both the latter two\u000a      trends had been raised at the launch of the policy as potential problems\u000a      which could inflate costs. The research was able to show that these trends\u000a      did not occur, leading to a more informed public debate2,3,4,5,6.\u000a      Researching costs in Wales and Northern Ireland found these to be\u000a      prohibitive7. In Scotland, we identified and explained the\u000a      rising costs of care, particularly the impact of the increased emphasis on\u000a      care at home. Issues for both service providers and service users were\u000a      explored in the subsequent investigation of self-directed support,\u000a      suggesting that this would not positively impact on the costs of care8.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44126","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3425505","Name":"Greenland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The reach of the impact has extended from the initial work in West\u000a      Lothian to involve service providers, especially of health and social care\u000a      services, across Europe, as described below. The significance of the\u000a      impact relates to the need to deliver care and support for an ageing\u000a      population in the context of constrained resources. The huge interest in\u000a      the contribution that telehealthcare can make to this international\u000a      challenge relates both to its economic benefit and to its ability to\u000a      support people to live independently at home in the heart of their\u000a      families and communities, both of which were evidenced in the original\u000a      West Lothian work. A key issue with telehealthcare is that large scale\u000a      rollouts are comparatively rare: West Lothian remains one of very few\u000a      internationally, and barriers to large scale roll out have included\u000a      uncertainty about how to make decisions. The MAST manual7\u000a      provides now proven support for such decision making, as we describe\u000a      below.\u000a    The West Lothian evaluation8 has had local, national and\u000a      international impact. Locally the work informed the telehealthcare\u000a      programme in West Lothian - by 2012, 112,000 people had received the\u000a      service, 2,500 people had been discharged from hospital earlier, 8,700\u000a      unplanned hospital admissions and 3,800 carehome admissions had been\u000a      avoided (Source: West Lothian performance statistics). The formative and\u000a      summative analysis provided in the research informed the development of\u000a      the programme, for example establishing the need for early intervention\u000a      and supporting the `mainstreaming' approach whereby a basic package of\u000a      technology was made universally available.\u000a    Internationally, the evaluation has brought prominence to telehealthcare\u000a      in West Lothian, and Stirling regularly hosts international visitors\u000a      wanting to review the system for potential implementation in their own\u000a      countries and seeking advice on their upcoming telecare innovations; most\u000a      recently Lind&#229;s (Norway - 2012) and nine Danish municipalities (2012). The\u000a      visitors habitually attend West Lothian and the University, where we have\u000a      a demonstration suite for telehealthcare which is part of our Dementia\u000a      Services Development Centre (see below). Lind&#229;s municipality, following\u000a      their visit to Stirling and West Lothian and informed by our evaluation,\u000a      are currently developing a telehealthcare system. Further evidence of the\u000a      continuing importance of our work is that we are currently partners in the\u000a      EU Northern Peripheries Programme funded `Remodem'9 service\u000a      development project, relating to the development of services for people\u000a      with dementia and their families and communities in remote Northern\u000a      Europe. In Remodem, providers in municipalities in Norrbotten (Sweden),\u000a      Naervikid (Faroe Islands), Sermersooq (Greenland), Shetland Islands and\u000a      Eilean Siar (Scotland) are developing and delivering a template of\u000a      dementia care for remote areas. Our role, built on our research expertise,\u000a      is to provide the evidence base to support the developments and to provide\u000a      formative evaluation of the services.\u000a    Our research in West Lothian and the depth of knowledge and experience of\u000a      telehealthcare that came with it engendered our participation in the\u000a      Methotelemed project, which developed the MAST methodology which supports\u000a      decision making about telehealthcare adoption10. MAST is now\u000a      being used across Europe to inform decision making about telehealthcare\u000a      rollouts. The following organisations have adopted MAST: the British\u000a      Thoracic Society; Recherche Clinique Sant&#233; Publique (Paris); Basque Office\u000a      for Health Technology Assessment; the Danish Regions in their Telemedicine\u000a      Strategy (corroboration below)11.\u000a    At EU level, a major implementation project is in progress using MAST.\u000a      Renewing Health12, (completing 18 trials), is delivering `large\u000a      scale, real-life testbeds' for telehealthcare, using MAST as the common\u000a      assessment approach The project involves service providing authorities in\u000a      Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Finland, Greece, Austria and\u000a      Germany. As well as her authorship of MAST, Bowes has provided expert\u000a      input to the work of Renewing Health on patient perspectives (Berlin 2010)\u000a      and on qualitative assessment of ethical and societal issues in relation\u000a      to telehealthcare (Treviso 2012).\u000a    In Scotland, Bowes is a member of the National Telehealth and Telecare\u000a      Advisory Board: this body provides advice to Scottish Government on\u000a      telehealthcare strategy for NHS and local authorities.

West Lothian Council had tackled the issue of user acceptability\u000a      by offering a core package of Smart equipment to everyone of retirement\u000a      age (10,000 households). This meant the stigma of needing support from\u000a      services was reduced and made technology more acceptable to service users.\u000a      The evaluation had a formative component, informing the rollout of\u000a      telecare as it occurred. Interim reports of research findings went to the\u000a      senior staff involved in implementing the programme, and early findings\u000a      were presented to a wider audience of staff at all levels. The evaluation\u000a      was able to demonstrate, for example, that implementing telecare before\u000a      people had reached crisis point was working better in terms of keeping\u000a      people at home than was the previous strategy of intervening when people\u000a      were `at risk' of having to move to residential care. The summative\u000a      research findings1,2,3 demonstrated the potential of large\u000a      scale roll-out of telecare for older people - 2,700 households were\u000a      included by the end of the evaluation. The research also demonstrated the\u000a      challenges that telecare presented to staff's customary ways of working\u000a      and the peace of mind that telecare could offer family caregivers. It\u000a      challenged the notion that telecare substituted for human contact, or was\u000a      difficult to deploy. The West Lothian case remains one of only a few large\u000a      implementations of telecare to have been systematically evaluated.\u000a    This knowledge base provided the foundation for participation in\u000a      MethoTelemed (2009-2010), an EU funded project with Norwegian and Danish\u000a      partners. Based on an extensive systematic review of reviews and a series\u000a      of expert workshops, the research produced academic outputs4,5,6\u000a      and was translated into the MAST (Model for Assessment of Telemedicine)\u000a      manual, an evaluation tool for health and social care providers to use\u000a      when making decisions about when, where and how to roll out telehealthcare\u000a      to people with long term conditions. MAST developed EUNetHTA (European\u000a      Network for Health Technology Assessment) methodology to be specifically\u000a      appropriate for telehealthcare applications in consultation with decision\u000a      makers from across Europe (34 experts from 12 countries and several\u000a      international organisations including WHO and patients' representatives).\u000a      The systematic review established and evaluated the international state of\u000a      the art in telehealthcare effectiveness and evaluation methodologies,\u000a      directly informing MAST. MAST highlights the key questions that service\u000a      providers need to investigate before they roll-out a `mature' technology,\u000a      i.e. one that has already been piloted and proven to work, but which has\u000a      not yet been used on a wide scale. It highlights evidence from the\u000a      scientific record and the research completed in MethoTelemed in support of\u000a      the guidance it contains.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44127","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The most tangible impact has come from two strands that reach across the\u000a      UK. The first has been significant improvement in practitioner knowledge\u000a      and confidence from training and knowledge exchange. With Action for\u000a      Children, Daniel won a bid to the DfE for &#163;182,951.20 to develop training\u000a      materials building on the SCRI research for use by all Local Safeguarding\u000a      Children Boards in England (completed 10\/7\/12)1. The Scottish\u000a      Government commissioned a version not tied to English policy, (completed\u000a      May 2013). The materials are embedded in a DfE funded training initiative\u000a      in England led by `Child and Family Training'2.\u000a    Over 100 participating agencies have access to an e-learning module on\u000a      neglect developed by Research in Practice (RiP) which includes the\u000a      findings and a podcast by Daniel3. It is RiP's most popular\u000a      module and between Mar '12 - Oct `13 had already been used by 439 people.\u000a      Of 107 who provided feedback 64% reported increased knowledge and 83% said\u000a      they would use the information with comments such as `Enable me to\u000a        make more informed decisions whilst working with children in care.'; `i\u000a        will draw upon the research when dealing with possible neglect in\u000a        families'; `Yes all future work and earlier identif[i]cation of\u000a        neglect.' All clinical staff in NHSScotland have access to the NHS\u000a      Education for Scotland Child Protection on-line Learning Resource which\u000a      includes the findings and a podcast by Daniel4.\u000a    A follow-on ESRC knowledge exchange award was obtained in 2012 for\u000a      &#163;88,493.52. Action on Neglect used co-production to work over a\u000a      year with multi-disciplinary groups of 37 practitioners in three\u000a      participating authorities, 9 parents and 4 young people who developed\u000a      specific ways to improve `pathways to help' for neglected children at a\u000a      local level that were developed into national guidance for policy and\u000a      practice. 84 representatives from the UK attended the national launch. 161\u000a      practitioners attended final practice development events held in each\u000a      participating authority in Spring 2013, examples of feedback are `What\u000a        I will take away with me from this experience is to always remain child\u000a        focus[ed]' (Stockport); `I am planning to roll out your pack to\u000a        our college teaching team' (Barnet); `I have had so many people\u000a        compliment the event and how much the content had and will inform their\u000a        practice'; `the resource packs are beautiful and I love the positive\u000a        images of children' (BathNES). Several authorities are drawing on\u000a      the work for service development.\u000a    The second and most significant impact strand has been policy influence.\u000a      The findings of the first review were reported to the Chair of the House\u000a      of Commons Education Committee inquiry on child protection that\u000a      subsequently moved to a new focus on responses to neglected children. The\u000a      report cites the research and makes specific recommendations on training,\u000a      early intervention and timely responses (2012)5. At the UK\u000a      launch of the 1st review on 24\/1\/12 at the House of Commons the\u000a      Children's Minister and Shadow Minister emphasised the importance of early\u000a      intervention and commitment to implement some of the recommendations.\u000a      There was an audience reach of 97,470,367 for the coverage and by March\u000a      2012 over 1,000 people had accessed information from the Action for\u000a      Children website6. A Senior Policy Advisor said `...more MPs\u000a        wrote to Ministers here on that issue than anything else.' The\u000a      Minister's responses to two Westminster Parliamentary Questions mentioning\u000a      the reviews (30.1.12, 19.3.12) note a consultation on children's\u000a      safeguarding performance information `this includes additional\u000a        information on neglect'; changes to social work training and changes\u000a      to statutory guidance: `Our aim is to free social workers and other\u000a        professionals from unnecessary bureaucracy...'7. The\u000a      revised Working Together guidance on multi-professional working\u000a      includes attention to the provision of `early help'8. The\u000a      second review was launched at the all-party Child Protection Group in\u000a      Westminster 6.2.13 where the Children's minister announced that Ofsted\u000a      would undertake a thematic review of neglect as recommended (to report in\u000a      Autumn 2013).\u000a    All the research has impacted on Scotland and the impending Children\u000a        and Young People (Scotland) Bill. Of the Scottish report, one child\u000a      protection lead officer commented: `I have circulated it widely within\u000a        [LA] asking everyone to study the work, as I feel it should become one\u000a        of those seminal documents that very clearly and directly informs policy\u000a        in Scotland.' (25.7.12). Children in Scotland (the national agency\u000a      for those working with children and their families in Scotland) hosted\u000a      seminar attended by Scottish Government policy makers to explore ways in\u000a      which the body of research can continue to shape developments.\u000a      Daniel gave evidence to, and is quoted in the report of the Parliamentary\u000a      Inquiry into Children Taken into Care10.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The findings from this research on noticing and helping neglected\u000a      children are contributing to shaping effective responses by practitioners.\u000a      In high income countries neglect is the most frequent category of child\u000a      maltreatment. In the UK as many as one in ten children may experience\u000a      neglect and yet systems here, and other jurisdictions with similar models,\u000a      struggle to provide an effective response. The research at Stirling is\u000a      improving practitioner knowledge and confidence with the development of\u000a      comprehensive training materials and follow-on knowledge exchange work\u000a      with multi-disciplinary groups of practitioners in England.

It addressed three questions:\u000a    \u000a      What is known about the ways in which children and families directly\u000a        and indirectly signal their need for help?\u000a      To what extent are practitioners equipped to recognise and respond to\u000a        the indications that a child's needs are likely to be, or are being\u000a        neglected, whatever the cause?\u000a      Does the evidence suggest that professional response could be swifter?\u000a    \u000a    Using systematic review guidelines 14 databases were searched for primary\u000a      research studies published in English from 1995-2005. An initial 20,480\u000a      items were systematically filtered down to 63 papers for inclusion.\u000a      Messages for policy, practice and research were produced and papers\u000a      written for peer-reviewed journals. The research report was subject to\u000a      rigorous peer review by the Department for Education independent panel and\u000a      few amendments were required. The book (Daniel et al. 2011) was\u000a      written at the request of the funders as part of a SCRI series.\u000a    Neglect tends to attract less public attention than other maltreatment.\u000a      All too often children have to endure chronic lack of physical and\u000a      emotional care over long periods of time before they receive help. The\u000a      research shed considerable light on what may be going wrong. It led to the\u000a      conclusion that `neglect' as defined by the official system has become\u000a      overly complicated and process-bound. The studies reviewed had gathered\u000a      evidence about the ways in which neglected children's need for help is\u000a      spotted by those in a position to help and what happens in the early\u000a      stages of the involvement of the system &#8212; known as 'recognition and\u000a      response'. The review confirmed that the evidence about the signs of\u000a      neglect upon children's well-being and development is extensive The\u000a      assumption is that practitioners such as health visitors need to be better\u000a      `detectives', however, the research indicated that practitioners are\u000a      better able to spot both the direct and indirect signs of neglect than\u000a      they are given credit for. Practitioners such as teachers and health\u000a      visitors find that it is difficult to get a response to their concerns\u000a      from children's social care and social workers find that they are caught\u000a      up in a lot of procedural issues. One of the key findings from the\u000a      research was that the systems developed in the UK can actually get in the\u000a      way of neglected children getting help promptly. On the basis of the\u000a      research a more child-focused framework for practitioners was developed.\u000a    The study led to Action for Children commissioning Daniel to lead a\u000a      series of annual research studies to review policy and practice with\u000a      neglect to inform policy on recognition and response.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44128","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research has achieved global reach and significance. The results of\u000a      Birchall and Simmons'\u000a      third ESRC-funded project began to be disseminated in 2008, and these\u000a      confirmed their earlier\u000a      work that had argued that the co-operative form of business should be\u000a      taken seriously as a vehicle\u000a      for poverty reduction in low-income countries. Through a report for the UK\u000a      Co-operative College,\u000a      the evidence presented helped promote a change of policy in DfID towards\u000a      working with co-operatives; support for the College's work in Africa followed through a\u000a      rolling programme of\u000a      financial support (evaluated by Simmons). Our framework for understanding\u000a      the `co-operative\u000a      reform process' informed the work of the International Co-operative\u000a      Alliance and Co-operatives UK\u000a      in developing a kite marque for co-operatives, promoting the updating of\u000a      co-operative laws, and\u000a      providing advice to governments on appropriate forms of regulation. In\u000a      Serbia, Simmons helped\u000a      develop a national strategy for agricultural co-operatives and gave\u000a      evidence to government\u000a      ministries (Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance,\u000a      Ministry of Agriculture), a\u000a      formal working group on the new draft co-operative law, aid agencies (such\u000a      as USAID and UNDP)\u000a      and local NGOs.\u000a    In 2008, Birchall was invited to speak to the UN Commission for Social\u000a      Development annual\u000a      conference on `Reducing poverty through employment generation: the role of\u000a      co-operatives' in\u000a      New York. He was invited to give a keynote speech at the award of the\u000a      Sigillum Magnum (great\u000a      seal) of Bologna University to Ivano Barberini, President of the\u000a      International Co-operative Alliance.\u000a      This honour is usually reserved for popes and prime ministers, and the\u000a      award to the leader of the\u000a      co-operative movement was a further sign of the growing appreciation of\u000a      the significance of\u000a      cooperatives. Barberini asked Birchall to give the speech in recognition\u000a      that his research was\u000a      having a direct and continuing impact on the policies and practices of the\u000a      International Co-operative Alliance. In 2009, Birchall was invited by the ILO to write a\u000a      report on the resilience of co-operatives in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Resilience\u000a        of the Co-operative\u000a        Business Model in times of crisis (2009, with Lou Hammond Ketilson)\u000a      was also published in Italian,\u000a      Mizo and Greek.\u000a    Such was the impact of this report worldwide that the ILO commissioned a\u000a      follow-up report on\u000a      financial co-operatives entitled Resilience in a Downturn: the power of\u000a        financial co-operatives.\u000a      Since launch in April 2013, such is the demand for access to its analysis\u000a      of the financial crisis and\u000a      its aftermath that it has already been translated into Spanish, Korean,\u000a      French and Greek.\u000a    In 2009, Birchall was invited to be a member of an expert group that met\u000a      at the UN in New York to\u000a      discuss the idea of an International Year of Co-operatives. The experts\u000a      agreed that it was Birchall\u000a      and Simmons' work that had made the proposal possible by raising the\u000a      profile of co-operatives and\u000a      showing their potential. Birchall wrote the Group's report that became\u000a      part of the Director-General's\u000a      annual report to the UN, and led directly to the decision to declare 2012\u000a      the International Year of\u000a      Co-operatives. The year was an outstanding success. It included\u000a      international conferences in\u000a      Manchester and Quebec, each attended by around 10,000 co-operative members\u000a      and supporters.\u000a      90 member governments prepared a plan for the Year, including events,\u000a      conferences, and the\u000a      development of new policies and national legislation to support\u000a      co-operatives. The Year has, in\u000a      turn, led to a 10-year `Co-operative Blueprint' for further work by the\u000a      International Co-operative\u000a      Alliance (which cites Birchall and Simmons).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The work of Birchall and Simmons on the potential of co-operatives, and\u000a      their comparative\u000a      advantage when compared to other organisational types, has had a strong\u000a      impact on the attitudes\u000a      and policies of all the major international agencies concerned with\u000a      poverty reduction in low-income\u000a      countries. It has helped shape new programmes of work in promoting and\u000a      strengthening co-\u000a      operative businesses worldwide. It led directly to the UN's declaration of\u000a      2012 as the International\u000a      Year of Co-operatives. The Year was regarded as an outstanding success,\u000a      with almost all the\u000a      member countries contributing programmes of events and reviewing and\u000a      developing policies\u000a      towards co-operatives.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Stirling\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Stirling (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Stirling","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007804}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1262963","Name":"State of Mizoram"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aBirchall, J (2001) Organising Workers in the Informal Sector: a\u000a        Strategy for Joint Co-operative-Trade Union Action, Geneva: International Labour Organisation\u000a    \u000a\u000a(2003) Rediscovering the Cooperative Advantage: Poverty Reduction\u000a        Through Self-help, Geneva:\u000a      International Labour Organisation\u000a    \u000a\u000a(2004) Co-operatives and the Millennium Development Goals,\u000a      Geneva: International Labour\u000a      Organisation (also in Spanish, Indonesian)\u000a    \u000a\u000a(2010) People-centred Businesses: Co-operatives, Mutuals and the Idea\u000a        of Membership, London:\u000a      Palgrave Macmillan (also in Korean, Japanese)\u000a    \u000a\u000a(2011) `The comparative advantages of member-owned businesses', Review\u000a        of Social Economy\u000a      50.3, 263-294\u000a    \u000a\u000aBirchall and Simmons, R (2003a) Motivating members: member\u000a        participation on governance: a\u000a        study of the Co-operative Group, Manchester: Co-operative College\u000a      Paper 3\u000a    \u000a\u000a(2003b) Getting involved: studies of member participation in\u000a        co-operatives across the West\u000a        Midlands Manchester: Co-operative College Paper 2\u000a    \u000a\u000a(2004a) `What motivates members to participate in co-operative and mutual\u000a      businesses: a\u000a      theoretical model and some findings', Annals of Public and\u000a        Co-operative Economics', 75.3, 465-497\u000a    \u000a\u000a(2004b) Participation overview and Participatory stocktaking\u000a      in Governance and Participation\u000a      Project Development Toolkit, Manchester, Co-operatives UK\u000a    \u000a\u000aBirchall, J and Simmons, R (2009) Co-operatives and Poverty Reduction:\u000a        evidence from Sri Lanka\u000a        and Tanzania, Manchester: UK Co-operative College\u000a    \u000a\u000a(2010) `The co-operative reform process in Tanzania and Sri Lanka', Annals\u000a        of Public and Co-operative Economics, 81.3, 467-500\u000a    \u000a\u000aSimmons, R.

When\u000a      we started our research in 2000, the dominant assumption among economists\u000a      was that they were\u000a      flawed because their members were `rational actors' who had no incentive\u000a      to participate in\u000a      governance. Through four research projects (three of which were\u000a      ESRC-funded with Johnston\u000a      Birchall as principal and Richard Simmons as co-investigator), we\u000a      developed a theoretical model\u000a      that, when tested on members of co-operatives in the UK, showed that they\u000a      would participate, from\u000a      collectivistic as well as from individualistic motives (Birchall, and\u000a      Simmons, 2004a). The research\u000a      provided a detailed understanding of the circumstances in which the\u000a      internal governance of co-operatives\u000a      is successful. With the UK Co-operative College, we published a `toolkit'\u000a      and two\u000a      reports (2003a, 2003b, 2004b), and in partnership with a training company\u000a      (Rod Laird Associates)\u000a      devised a set of training courses that communicated the findings to\u000a      practitioners and helped them\u000a      to devise realistic participation strategies. In parallel with this, the\u000a      International Labour Organisation\u000a      (ILO) commissioned further reports using a combination of desk research\u000a      and case studies. The\u000a      first showed that co-operatives could meet the needs of entrepreneurs in\u000a      the informal economy,\u000a      and led directly to a $1m development project in which the ILO set up\u000a      shared service cooperatives\u000a      in three African cities (Birchall, 2001); this led to the method being\u000a      adopted by development\u000a      agencies more generally. The second report showed how co-operatives could\u000a      meet the stated\u000a      goals of the World Bank and UN agencies (2003), while the third applied\u000a      these insights to the\u000a      Millennium Development Goals (2004). Dissemination of the research was\u000a      enabled by invitations\u000a      to give keynotes to co-operative business federations and development\u000a      agencies in Japan (2000,\u000a      2012), Sweden (2003), Colombia (2005) Italy (2004, 2008, 2012), Washington\u000a      (2006) Vietnam\u000a      (2006), New York (UN, 2008, 2009), Korea (twice in 2011).\u000a    By 2006 the World Bank, FAO, ILO, and other agencies had all begun\u000a      promoting and working with\u000a      co-operatives; Birchall's work was generally recognised as having\u000a      contributed directly to this\u000a      change of attitude and policy. We had to cancel a proposed project asking\u000a      why there was\u000a      resistance to the idea, as several experts recruited to our advisory group\u000a      agreed that, due to these\u000a      two reports it was no longer an issue (see `sources to corroborate the\u000a      impact' below). However, it\u000a      was recognised that the empirical evidence for effectiveness was mainly\u000a      based on case studies,\u000a      and DfID asked us to provide more robust survey-based evidence. To do\u000a      this, we carried out a 2.5\u000a      year study (in the ESRC's Non-governmental Action Programme), with a\u000a      large-scale survey of co-operatives in Sri Lanka and Tanzania (Birchall and Simmons, 2009). Simmons\u000a      then replicated this\u000a      in Serbia (Simmons, 2011). This research provided empirical evidence for\u000a      the effectiveness of co-operative businesses, specifying more exactly their comparative advantages\u000a      and disadvantages\u000a      (Birchall, 2010, 2011). It also led to our providing a theoretical\u000a      framework for a `co-operative reform\u000a      process' that development agencies could adapt to circumstances in each\u000a      country (Birchall and\u000a      Simmons, 2010). This research and dissemination has resulted in\u000a      substantial impact in the period\u000a      since 2008, as set out in section 4 below.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44630","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    \u000d        The report on media coverage and public perceptions of poverty was\u000d        launched in 2008 with presentations to the Society of Editors; the All\u000d        Parliamentary Group on Poverty; the Scottish Government; the TUC\u000d        national conference; the Association of Journalism Educators; and the\u000d        BBC College of Journalism.

The briefing also informed the Outer Hebrides Working Group\u000d        on Poverty and Welfare Reform's communication plan:\u000d    http:\/\/ohcpp.org.uk\/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=116&amp;Itemid=234\u000d    \u000d        Our findings informed the revised media engagement strategies of several\u000d        poverty campaigning organisations: For example, in 2009\/10 the Poverty\u000d        Alliance prepared a contact list of journalists with an interest in\u000d        poverty, and provided media training to local community representatives\u000d        and activists who are now able to satisfy journalist's requests to\u000d        interview people with experience of poverty.\u000d    \u000d        Findings from the media project have been used by the 'Stick Your\u000d        Labels' campaign developed by an Anti-Stigma Working Group:\u000d        https:\/\/en-gb.facebook.com\/StickYourLabels. This campaign secured a\u000d        public commitment from the leaders of all the main Scottish political\u000d        parties to avoid stigmatising language in relation to those experiencing\u000d        poverty, and to challenge unrepresentative negative portrayals of low\u000d        income communities: http:\/\/www.cpag.org.uk\/content\/fm-and-party-leaders-sign-anti-stigma-commitment-shocking-%E2%80%98state-nation%E2%80%99-poverty-report-laun\u000d          (17th March\u000d        2011). This research and the related Poverty in Scotland 2011 book were\u000d        referred to in Scottish Parliament debates; and the Scottish Government\u000d        affirmed its support for the campaign in its Child Poverty Strategy\u000d        (2010, p.11). The legacy of these public commitments is reflected in the\u000d        lower prominence within mainstream Scottish political discourse of the\u000d        divisive rhetoric of 'scroungers' and 'skivers' prominent elsewhere in\u000d        the UK. The continued impact of our research is reflected by reference\u000d        to it in the UK Church Action on Poverty report, The Blame Game Must\u000d        Stop (2013,\u000d        p.10).http:\/\/www.church-poverty.org.uk\/stigma\/report\/blamegamereport\u000d    \u000d        The JRF's own evaluation of the PIPI programme (see Section 5) includes\u000d        testimony from a government policy maker describing the project's impact\u000d        on her professional activity as 'factoring attitudinal work into policy\u000d        formation [and] facilitating greater contact with the third sector' (p.\u000d        4). Similarly, a Northern Ireland government policy maker described the\u000d        project's impact as ensuring that the Northern Ireland Executive's\u000d        review of its ageing strategy reached 'beyond the \"usual suspects\" to\u000d        those who may not be automatically sympathetic'. In particular our\u000d        project's evidence on how damaging stereotypes can be reproduced\u000d        unthinkingly had 'alerted her to the danger of using the language of the\u000d        \"underclass\" - it's always \"somebody else\", people in poverty are\u000d        different from \"us\"'(p. 21).\u000d    \u000d        The importance of the Community Regeneration and Tackling Poverty\u000d        Community of Practice (the former name of the Employability and Tackling\u000d        Poverty Learning Network), which has drawn upon the analysis, advice and\u000d        guidance provided by the GCU team is referred to in the Scottish\u000d        Government's Child Poverty Strategy (2010, p.51), which described it as\u000d        'a well used resource across the Scottish public sector'\u000d        http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Publications\/2011\/03\/14094421. The Scottish\u000d        Government's 2011 Child Poverty Strategy Annual Report reiterated this\u000d        impact (p. 3) and testified to the value of the Child Poverty Online\u000d        Resource, Poverty-Sensitive Decision-Making Guide and Guide to Effective\u000d        Local Measurement of Poverty, produced by McKendrick\u000d        as part of Tackling Child Poverty Locally project.

The Forum was established\u000d        with Scottish Government support to enable dialogue between policy\u000d        makers, representatives of deprived communities and other stakeholders,\u000d        and to scrutinise the Achieving Our Potential strategy. The Forum\u000d        facilitated sustained engagement between poverty campaigners and senior\u000d        Government officials, and had a direct influence on policy; particularly\u000d        tackling the 'poverty premium', fuel poverty, and mitigating the impact\u000d        of UK welfare reforms. The Scottish Government Europe 2020: Scottish\u000d        National Reform Programme 2012\/13 described the TPSF as an 'effective\u000d        and efficient model of good practice on the issue of participation in\u000d        national policy development' (p.42).http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/0039\/00392200\u000d    \u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    \u000d      GCU research into media coverage and public perceptions of poverty, and\u000d      measures to tackle poverty has had an impact on policy making, policy\u000d      content and the public discourse of poverty.

Dobbie and Irwin have subsequently left GCU (June\u000d    2010 and January 2013). Scott retired from GCU in October 2007 but has an\u000d    emerita role. This mixed methods project involved five integrated\u000d    activities: content analysis of 640 poverty reports in UK news media; a\u000d    Critical Discourse Analysis of six poverty-related reports from a range of\u000d    UK newspapers; Foucauldian analysis of representations of poverty in over 40\u000d    hours of UK television drama (soap operas), and 10 hours of 'reality'\u000d    television programmes; nine interviews with key individuals involved in the\u000d    production of poverty-related news; and six focus groups conducted across\u000d    Britain to explore public responses to media representations of poverty. The\u000d    project was part of the JRF's Public Interest in Poverty Issues (PIPI)\u000d    programme.\u000d    \u000d    This project found that poverty was not itself a prominent item in news\u000d    reporting: 43% of references to poverty were merely incidental to the main\u000d    item covered; poverty was often associated with more 'news worthy' issues\u000d    (such as political conflict, crime, etc.). Coverage was more likely to refer\u000d    to poverty in the developing world (54% of stories) than in the UK (46%).\u000d    Those directly experiencing poverty featured in only one in eight reports.\u000d    Many reports portrayed those experiencing poverty as passive victims, even\u000d    if coverage was generally sympathetic. Realistic representations of poverty\u000d    were largely absent from contemporary dramas and few documentaries\u000d    contributed to improved public understanding of the causes or experience of\u000d    poverty. In these respects the project reflected upon and updated some\u000d    findings from Golding and Middleton's Images Of Welfare project from almost\u000d    30 years earlier. The project also went beyond this to analyse the\u000d    production of poverty reporting and audience reception. Lessons from the\u000d    former have informed the media engagement strategies of third sector and\u000d    campaigning organisations (see section 4 below). Findings from the latter\u000d    have cast additional light on the nature of media 'influence' upon public\u000d    perceptions of poverty. The Tackling Child Poverty Locally (2011; 2012)\u000d    project involved original research and secondary data analysis to develop an\u000d    integrated body of training resources, stakeholder dialogue events and\u000d    advice workshops for both national policy makers and local public sector\u000d    practitioners in Scotland. This included developing an online child poverty\u000d    toolkit and producing Briefing Papers and Action Learning Sets to assist\u000d    local practitioners to prepare and implement child poverty strategies. These\u000d    informed the work of the Employability and Tackling\u000d      Poverty Learning Network (ETPLN).\u000d    \u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44631","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d      Research by Gilchrist (2009) has been used to\u000d        identify changeable beliefs within the IPV population.

The GCU work (2007 - ongoing) has explored\u000d      mechanisms, such as implicit thinking (Gilchrist, 2009; Weldon &amp;\u000d      Gilchrist, 2012) and alcohol (McMurran &amp; Gilchrist, 2008; Gilchrist\u000d      &amp; Ireland, 2013) which appear to underpin IPV offending; explored a)\u000d      factors contributing to risk, such as coercive sexual behaviours (Morgan\u000d      &amp; Gilchrist, 2010; Gilchrist, 2012) and b) new interventions,\u000d      particularly collaborative input and parenting interventions for IPV\u000d      (Gilchrist &amp;Landale, 2012).\u000d     Uniquely, this research has linked two\u000d      traditionally competing bodies of knowledge around IPV: victim based\u000d      knowledge which emphasises the role of gender and IPV and which leads to\u000d      support for victims and demands for accountability and monitoring of\u000d      offenders, but which has not been successful in informing effective\u000d      interventions to reduce risk in offenders, and the forensic psychology\u000d      knowledge about perpetrator characteristics and criminogenic need which\u000d      led to generic anger and violence focussed interventions which have\u000d      limited success and which have ignored the preponderance of male\u000d      perpetrators, and the specific risk markers for different groupings of IPV\u000d      and which have been viewed as limiting culpability in offenders and as\u000d      being less sensitive to victim experiences.\u000d     The research has provided new insights into possible targets for change\u000d      in interventions with IPV offenders and suggested approaches to assessing\u000d      risk relevant change. \u000d    Linked work (Gilchrist and Dalton, 2010; Langlands, Ward &amp; Gilchrist,\u000d      2009 and Gilchrist &amp; Landale; 2013) has explored the potential of new\u000d      interventions for IPV offenders. Initial work considered the benefits of a\u000d      'strengths-based' intervention which aimed to work with perpetrators own\u000d      goals, within the broad 'good lives framework, suggesting that this would\u000d      be better at engaging men in treatment and more effective in promoting\u000d      desistance than the previous directly confrontational, more\u000d      psycho-educational than therapeutic inputs that have routinely been\u000d      offered (Gilchrist &amp; Dalton, 2010). Initial results suggested that\u000d      attrition from this programme was lessthan meta-analyses in this area\u000d      would suggest.\u000d     More recent work by Gilchrist &amp; Landale (2013) has focussed on the\u000d      benefits of a parenting intervention for IPV perpetrators. The work has\u000d      initially focussed on the co-ordination of services required to deliver\u000d      such an intervention. Early results identify clashes in service ideology\u000d      and safety concerns as key areas to be addressed when implementing the\u000d      types of interventions. Also, the benefits of joint training of\u000d      professionals from traditionally separated services, e.g. victim advocacy\u000d      and criminal justice social work and enhanced communication is\u000d      highlighted. Work by Gilchrist &amp; Ireland (2013)\u000d        founded on initial theoretical work by McMurran &amp; Gilchrist (2008)\u000d        has focussed on the role of alcohol in IPV. The research identifying\u000d        peaks associated with significant cultural events, in particular annual\u000d        festivities and significant football matches has challenged traditional\u000d        views of alcohol as merely a convenient excuse for abuse, and has\u000d        highlighted the importance of recording in IPV practice.\u000d    \u000d    "}]

[{"CaseStudyId":"1441","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    We have organised various research-led events for local benefactors in\u000d\u000a      order to develop impact\u000d\u000a      from our research. These have taken the form of exhibitions, public\u000d\u000a      lectures, discussion fora, and\u000d\u000a      interactive workshops centred on Norwich &#8212; City of Interculture.\u000d\u000a      This `festival' celebrating\u000d\u000a      intercultural relations took place at the Forum in Norwich, a public venue\u000d\u000a      that houses the\u000d\u000a      Millennium Library, lecture theatres and exhibition spaces and BBC East.\u000d\u000a      The Forum was chosen\u000d\u000a      as the fulcrum of these public engagement activities because it is central\u000d\u000a      &#8212; geographically and\u000d\u000a      culturally &#8212; to the life of the city. The Forum sees a large amount of\u000d\u000a      footfall from local organisations\u000d\u000a      and individuals using its facilities, as well as from significant numbers\u000d\u000a      of tourists visiting the city.

By using\u000d\u000a      such means to engage\u000d\u000a      various local beneficiaries with our research we have enhanced their\u000d\u000a      understanding of intercultural\u000d\u000a      communication and thereby driven changes in the practice and policy of\u000d\u000a      Norfolk Constabulary,\u000d\u000a      Norwich City Football Club and Norwich City Council, in local perceptions\u000d\u000a      of identity and culture,\u000d\u000a      and &amp;mdash more broadly &#8212; in the values people hold when thinking\u000d\u000a      about themselves as global citizens\u000d\u000a      as well as members of specific local communities.\u000d\u000a    The impact of Filipovi&#263;'s research results from the public dissemination\u000d\u000a      of her research findings.\u000d\u000a      Initial insights from Filipovi&#263;'s research were presented, as part of the\u000d\u000a      Norwich &#8212; City of Interculture\u000d\u000a      events, at a public research and engagement seminar entitled `Translating\u000d\u000a      and Interpreting in\u000d\u000a      Police Contexts' (5\/12\/2011) with invited guests from Norfolk Constabulary\u000d\u000a      and the regional\u000d\u000a      community interpreting services (INTRAN) including the Head of Equality\u000d\u000a      and Diversity\u000d\u000a      representing Norfolk Constabulary Operations and Communications Centre who\u000d\u000a      comments that\u000d\u000a      the event `provided valuable new insights into the importance of\u000d\u000a      interpreting services within law\u000d\u000a      enforcement and Police interviewing practices' [source 1]. The impact was\u000d\u000a      immediate: the Police\u000d\u000a      authority saw that such research &#8212; because it brought to their attention\u000d\u000a      problems in bilingual\u000d\u000a      communication of which they were previously unaware &#8212; could improve their\u000d\u000a      understanding of, and\u000d\u000a      professional practices in, investigative interviewing with witnesses and\u000d\u000a      suspects who do not speak\u000d\u000a      English. As a result, a further collaboration with Filipovi&#263; was\u000d\u000a      instigated through invitations to\u000d\u000a      present further research findings to other Police representatives. Norfolk\u000d\u000a      Constabulary has\u000d\u000a      acknowledged that this collaboration will inform their policy and practice\u000d\u000a      and they are currently\u000d\u000a      collecting data of bilingual Police interviews for the UEA collaborative\u000d\u000a      research team (Filipovi&#263; (PI),\u000d\u000a      Guillot, de Pablos-Ortega, Musolff and Pounds) to focus on aspects of\u000d\u000a      cross-linguistic and cross-cultural\u000d\u000a      communication.

The Head of Equality and Diversity at\u000d\u000a      Norfolk Constabulary\u000d\u000a      comments that `The Norwich: City of Interculture initiative has\u000d\u000a      played a key part in raising public\u000d\u000a      awareness of, and changing the public's sense of, the value of\u000d\u000a      intercultural understanding in their\u000d\u000a      lives' [source 1] while Norwich City Council's Executive Head of\u000d\u000a      Customers, Communications and\u000d\u000a      Culture testifies: `[This] work with the local community on intercultural\u000d\u000a      communication has affected\u000d\u000a      the Council's thinking to the extent that we are looking at whether\u000d\u000a      Norwich might become a\u000d\u000a      member of the European Commission's Intercultural Cities programme'\u000d\u000a      [source 5].

In\u000d\u000a      February 2012, we invited the\u000d\u000a      club's Head of Media to Baines' research and engagement seminar on\u000d\u000a      professional sport,\u000d\u000a      globalization, and translation.

The\u000d\u000a      Head of Media, Norwich City\u000d\u000a      Football Club, testifies that `exposure to Dr Baines' work has increased\u000d\u000a      the Club's understanding of\u000d\u000a      linguistic and cultural assimilation issues potentially faced by foreign\u000d\u000a      players and staff coming to\u000d\u000a      work in the English game' [source 3].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study outlines how our research has improved intercultural\u000d\u000a      communication for a wide\u000d\u000a      range of beneficiaries in Norwich, Norfolk and the East of England.

This had been a constant reminder of the\u000a      suffering of the Apache people, who kept the memory of the children alive\u000a      for over a hundred years by annually re-telling the story at community\u000a      gatherings each August. In the documentary, The Lost Ones,\u000a      Chairman Romero explains how, as a result of Fear-Segal's work, members of\u000a      his community can now move beyond those feelings of loss to claim a new\u000a      strength: \"Fear-Segal...found our little ones. The Nd&#233; will forever make\u000a      mention of her name in our traditional oral history, for finding the Lost\u000a      Ones. The lives of the Nd&#233; become much richer with the knowledge that the\u000a      Lost Ones have come home in our hearts and minds. Now the Lost Ones are\u000a      found, the Nd&#233; can again be strong as a people, they say\" [Source 1].\u000a      Margo Tamez, an Nd&#233; historian and poet, suggests Fear-Segal has also\u000a      brought increased understanding of Nd&#233;-US relations to her community:\u000a      \"Fear-Segal's contributions to the Nd&#233; revitalization and empowerment are\u000a      important and noteworthy because they are having a positive impact on the\u000a      Nd&#233; community's appreciation for the complexity of our ...history with the\u000a      settler nation\" [Source 2]. The Nd&#233; have acknowledged the significance of\u000a      Fear-Segal's work for their community by posting her book on their web\u000a      site: http:\/\/www.lipanapachebandoftexas.com\/ancestry_005.htm\u000a    Crucially, at the same time that Fear-Segal was communicating the issue\u000a      of the lost children, the Nd&#233; elders were beginning to petition state and\u000a      federal governments for formal recognition of their tribe's status. To do\u000a      this, they had to demonstrate continuity of geographic location and\u000a      cultural traditions. News of the re-discovery of the two Nd&#233; children\u000a      (2002), publication of White Man's Club (2007), and the\u000a      spirit-releasing ceremony enacted at the children's graves (2009),\u000a      provided public evidence of these continuities [Source 3]. In March 2009,\u000a      the Nd&#233; were granted State Recognition by Texas. In August 2012 they\u000a      presented their petition for Federal Recognition. Fear-Segal's work thus\u000a      contributed to this broader context of cultural reawakening within the Nd&#233;\u000a      community, to the recreation of their cultural capital, and to political\u000a      recognition by the state of Texas and, it is anticipated, by the Federal\u000a      government. Their Vice Chairman explained: \"Fear- Segal's work provided\u000a      some of the vital evidence needed for the Nd&#233; to seek and gain official\u000a      recognition\" [Source 4]. More broadly, as a paradigm for collaborative\u000a      research leading to significant impacts, Nd&#233; scholar Tamez asserts that\u000a      Fear-Segal's \"work in all its dimensions has established a vital model in\u000a      how to conduct research with and alongside indigenous peoples\" [Source 2].\u000a    In 2010, in response to interest generated by Fear-Segal's work on the\u000a      Nd&#233; among other Carlisle descendant communities, Barbara Landis (Indian\u000a      School biographer at Cumberland County Historical Society, PA) set up a\u000a      Facebook group to facilitate Carlisle descendants' search for ancestors,\u000a      sharing of stories, circulation of photographs, and assessment of the\u000a      school's legacy. At July 2013 this group has 547 members: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/#!\/groups\/168544626516258\/\u000a    Fear-Segal's work has been instrumental in bringing stories, once only\u000a      narrated within the Nd&#233; community by oral tradition, to a national and\u000a      international audience. Firstly, press coverage of the Nd&#233; blessing\u000a      ceremonies contributed to public understanding of Apache history and\u000a      culture, as well as the enduring legacy of the government's programme of\u000a      Native American assimilation [Source 3]. Secondly, The Lost Ones\u000a      documentary, exploring issues of loss, cultural damage and indigenous\u000a      boarding schools, is described by the Nd&#233; Vice Chairman Gonzalez as \"an\u000a      extraordinary piece of work\" [Source 4]. Screenings, in Canada, New\u000a      Zealand, Argentina, Czech Republic, UK, US, [Source 5] consistently\u000a      provoke \"powerful discussions about this history [of boarding schools],\u000a      the current conditions of many indigenous peoples living both on and off\u000a      reservations, and human rights\" [Source 7].. At a California screening,\u000a      vociferous audience demand for an event on the site at Carlisle led\u000a      Fear-Segal and Susan Rose (the film's director) to organise a public\u000a      symposium: Carlisle PA: site of indigenous histories, memories, and\u000a        reclamations (October 5-6, 2012) [Source 8]. This brought over 290\u000a      delegates to Carlisle, including Pulitzer Prize winner N. Scott Momaday\u000a      (Kiowa) and over 150 other Native Americans from 36 tribes. Events were\u000a      covered in the press [Source 9].\u000a    An immediate impact of this symposium was the indefinite suspension of a\u000a      US Army order to demolish the Indian School Farmhouse, after an intense\u000a      roundtable meeting between symposium delegates and Army officials [Source\u000a      6]. The farmhouse, which today stands on the campus of the US Army War\u000a      College in Carlisle, is the only surviving building where Indian students\u000a      lived and worked, and in recognition of the role Fear-Segal's work played\u000a      in the preservation of this building, Rose asks, \"How many of us can say\u000a      our work has led to the U.S. Army deciding to stop a planned demolition?!\"\u000a      [Source 7].\u000a    A further key impact of this symposium was a successful grant application\u000a      to fund the digitisation of the Carlisle Indian School records, to create\u000a      a comprehensive searchable database of Carlisle Indian Industrial School\u000a      resources.

Her resulting monograph, White Man's Club\u000a      (reference 1), examines government Indian schools within the broad\u000a      framework of race relations. Biographical studies of individual students,\u000a      pieced together from archival fragments, are an important component of the\u000a      book and one of these led directly to this case study.\u000a    From the late 19th Century, American educators embarked on an\u000a      ambitious and controversial campaign to quash traditional cultures. Native\u000a      children were re-educated in the religion, values and customs of white\u000a      America, to prepare them for assimilation into mainstream society and\u000a      citizenship. By the 1920s, thousands of Native American children had been\u000a      forcibly removed from their homes across the US and transported to\u000a      military-style boarding schools. The denigration of Native Indian cultures\u000a      and the destruction of family and kinship networks had profoundly negative\u000a      results, which still resonate strongly in Native communities today. One\u000a      source of continuing distress has been the unknown fate of children who\u000a      died without returning to their communities. According to Native beliefs,\u000a      this denial of closure limits the capacity of successive generations to\u000a      move forward in either spiritual or material terms.\u000a    The US government sent over 10,000 children to the Carlisle Indian School\u000a      [1879-1918], which supplied the blueprint for its Indian School system.\u000a      Among them were two Nd&#233;. Kesetta and Jack were captured and sent to\u000a      Carlisle as prisoners of war, without their people's knowledge. They never\u000a      returned home. In the 18th century, the Lipan had been a very\u000a      large tribe inhabiting present- day Texas and New Mexico, but during the\u000a      19th century they faced persistent attack by the US army, as\u000a      white settlers moved onto their lands.\u000a    While researching the lives of Kesetta and Jack, Fear-Segal approached\u000a      the Nd&#233; General Council Chairman, Daniel Castro Romero, to enquire if he\u000a      knew about their capture and transportation to Carlisle as prisoners of\u000a      war. She learned that the Nd&#233; had been searching in vain for the two\u000a      children for four generations. She sent photographs of the children, from\u000a      Carlisle's Photo Archive, to Texas to confirm their identities. (For the\u000a      Lipan, these also provided important evidence of their historical\u000a      occupation of Texas lands). The Nd&#233; were determined to bring resolution by\u000a      travelling to Carlisle to perform traditional ceremonies at the children's\u000a      graves. In May 2009, Romero and two other elders made the long journey\u000a      from Texas to Pennsylvania and, after over a century, spirit-releasing\u000a      ceremonies finally took place. A documentary DVD based on Fear-Segal's\u000a      work, The Lost Ones: the Long Journey Home (reference 2), has been\u000a      shown widely to Native and White audiences. This contributed to growing\u000a      public disquiet about the Indian boarding schools' legacy, which\u000a      culminated in President Obama signing The Native American Apology\u000a        Resolution (December 2009).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3354","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Policy Impacts\u000a    In October 2009 the European Commission identified Dobson as the\u000a      best-positioned scholar to brief its officials at an informal seminar held\u000a      in Brussels on how to leverage cooperation with Japan in the G8 and G20 to\u000a      better achieve common goals. This briefing helped its officials \"better\u000a        understand Japan's immediate concerns and interests in various\u000a        multilateral fora and how we might be able to tap into these in our\u000a        pursuit of the EU's global aims\" (S1). Dobson's contributions \"remained\u000a        important underpinnings as we built on this early work on upgrading the\u000a        EU-Japan relationship at the subsequent 2010 and 2011 EU-Japan Summits\"\u000a      (S1). The result of this process was the Foreign Affairs Council's\u000a      decision in November 2012 to begin negotiations with Japan towards both a\u000a      Framework Agreement and a Free Trade Agreement.\u000a    In addition, Dobson has co-organised numerous policy-focused workshops\u000a      and briefings in collaboration with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u000a      (FCO) believing that \"it is invaluable and essential for diplomats in\u000a        the FCO to not only have at their fingertips our country's best research\u000a        on matters of policy importance, but also to have a sufficiently close\u000a        relationship with those experts that we may draw on their judgements at\u000a        often very short notice\" (S2). These events have included officials\u000a      with a direct role in the preparation of the G8 summit, such as the UK\u000a      sous-sherpa (aide) to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. A workshop in\u000a      February\/March 2008 entitled `The 2008 G8 Summit: Lessons for the UK and\u000a      Japan', took place at a time when, according to the aide, the UK\u000a      government was championing outreach and expansion among its G8 partners.\u000a      Dobson's research findings on Japan's promotion of, and resistance to,\u000a      these initiatives were fed into policymakers' understanding of what would\u000a      become a major issue just months after the workshop. These events have\u000a      also included officials with a direct role in UK-Japan relations, such as\u000a      the current UK Ambassador to Japan. During May and June 2013, Dobson\u000a      initiated, co-organised and participated in a series of weekly policy\u000a      briefings for the FCO on key issues, including global summitry, that were\u000a      timed around the 2013 Loch Erne Summit and \"informed policy officials\u000a        as to the latest research on these topics, [and] also brought together\u000a        colleagues from across different parts of government to discuss issues\u000a        of common relevance who otherwise might not have met\" (S2). Dobson\u000a      also edited the briefings as a volume of policy papers for distribution to\u000a      UK missions overseas to ensure that \"the impact of the seminars will\u000a        be made broader and more longer lasting\" (S2).\u000a    Media and Public Understanding Impacts\u000a    This impact was created through collaboration with global think tanks\u000a      including the G8\/G20 Research Groups, the Global Summitry Project and the\u000a      Centre for International Governance Innovation. Dobson has joined\u000a      researchers from these think tanks and secured official media\u000a      accreditation to attend G8 and G20 summits since 2008. He was thus able to\u000a      conduct a number of official press briefings and one-to-one in-depth\u000a      interviews with leading UK, Japanese and global media outlets including The\u000a        Times (readership: 500,000) and Asahi Shinbun (readership:\u000a      11 million), in addition to Nihon Keizai Shinbun (readership: 3\u000a      million), Wall Street Journal (readership: 2 million), Kyodo\u000a        News (Japan's major news agency and source of news for Japanese\u000a      newspapers, radio and television), BBC World Service (audience:\u000a      188 million), Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (the national\u000a      radio and television broadcaster), Canada Television Network (the\u000a      largest private broadcaster), China Radio International (China's\u000a      equivalent of the BBC World Service) and Xinhua (China's\u000a      major news agency and source of news for newspapers, radio and\u000a      television).\u000a    Thus, Dobson's research on the historical context of Japan's role in the\u000a      G8, the reasons behind the Japanese government's conflicted response to\u000a      the creation of the G20 and the role of non- traditional actors has\u000a      impacted on media understanding of these issues. According to a Japanese\u000a      journalist: \"[i]t is often the case at these major diplomatic events\u000a        that a correspondent inevitably relies heavily upon his or her own\u000a        government for the necessary information and insight into how the\u000a        various negotiations and diplomatic contacts are progressing. All the\u000a        more reason then why I have found Professor Dobson's help to be\u000a        invaluable\" (S3). Impacting on media understanding has in turn\u000a      impacted on the resulting reportage, as illustrated by two UK\u000a      journalists:\"I often find myself struggling to catch up very quickly on\u000a        complex subjects. Professor Dobson's clear explanations were exactly\u000a        what I needed, and The Times' coverage of the summit was\u000a        enhanced as a result\" (S4). \"He [Dobson] provides me with\u000a        the necessary information to put recent events into context and this\u000a        helps me judge whether something is particularly newsworthy or relevant\".\u000a      Moreover, this reportage ultimately impacts on public understanding by \"feed[ing]\u000a        into the national debate going on in Japan on particular issues\"\u000a      (S5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Through a series of briefings, interviews and workshops Hugo Dobson's\u000a      research on the Group of 8 and Group of 20 summits and the role played by\u000a      Japan has had both policy impacts and media\/public understanding impacts.\u000a      On the one hand, his research has impacted on European and UK\u000a      policymakers' knowledge base and policy debates, in addition to the\u000a      approaches they have taken in negotiations with the Japanese government.\u000a      On the other hand, his research has influenced the reportage of global\u000a      media outlets and their decisions as to what is newsworthy, ultimately\u000a      contributing to national debates, particularly in the UK and Japan.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Sheffield\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sheffield (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sheffield","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007157}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1.

This inspired Dobson's initial exploration of Japan's role in\u000a      the G8 based on archival work and interviews with a range of key\u000a      participants in the summit process, including leading Japanese\u000a      politicians. The result was the publication of Japan and the G7\/G8,\u000a        1975 to 2002 (R1) in addition to numerous book chapters and working\u000a      papers. This body of work represented the first systematic treatment of\u000a      Japan's role in the G8 and highlighted the range of actors involved, their\u000a      objectives and strategies, in addition to the overall importance of these\u000a      previously overlooked summit meetings to Japan in forging its identity and\u000a      shaping its behaviour.\u000a    During the second stage, from 2003 to 2008, the G8 underwent a process of\u000a      outreach and dialogue with potential new members that culminated in the\u000a      creation of the G20 in 2008 as the `premier forum for international\u000a      economic cooperation'. Dobson's research responded by tracing these\u000a      developments resulting in another well-received contribution to\u000a      Routledge's Global Institutions Series entitled The Group of\u000a        7\/8 and published in 2007, in addition to numerous book chapters and\u000a      working papers. This body of work not only accounted for the changes in\u000a      both the global order and global summitry but also outlined possible\u000a      future scenarios, presaging the creation of the G20, whilst arguing that\u000a      the G8 would continue and explaining Japan's qualified and contradictory\u000a      reaction to these developments.\u000a    The third stage is on-going since 2008 and has seen Dobson's research\u000a      continue to explore the development of the G8 and G20 resulting in a\u000a      number of online publications and peer-reviewed articles in leading Area\u000a      Studies and International Relations journals (R2). This body of work has\u000a      contributed to understanding by: 1) exploring the evolving relationship\u000a      between different mechanisms of global governance and accounting for the\u000a      continuation of the G8; 2) identifying and evaluating the\u000a      (in)effectiveness of various strategies adopted by Japan in managing this\u000a      highly fluid situation (R4; R5), including its use of global summitry to\u000a      turn controversial domestic issues, such as increasing the consumption tax\u000a      and the current government's economic strategy dubbed `Abenomics', into\u000a      summit commitments in order to get leverage at home; 3) assessing the way\u000a      in which Japan has managed key bilateral relations in a multilateral\u000a      context (R3); and 4) highlighting the contribution of non-traditional\u000a      actors including civil society and leaders' spouses to global summitry\u000a      (R6).\u000a    During this final stage Dobson attended summits as an accredited\u000a      journalist in order to observe and research various participants and\u000a      developments in global summitry. Concurrently, he co- organised and\u000a      participated in a series of briefings, interviews and workshops to\u000a      disseminate his research and impact upon the understandings and decisions\u000a      of policymakers and the global media.

Nurturing robust collaborations at differing levels of engagement\u000d\u000a&#8212; with policy practitioners, media and corporate representatives, third sector organisations, and\u000d\u000aschool and citizen groups &#8212; the principal impacts of his external activities are summarised here.\u000d\u000a1. Media\u000d\u000aMatanle's contribution to repositioning the public discourse on Japan's development began with\u000d\u000ahim helping journalists to revise assumptions about the stability and resilience of Japan's\u000d\u000adistinctive socio-economic institutions, and the importance of their socio-cultural underpinnings.\u000d\u000aThis included commenting on work and suicide for niche online publications such as The Fresh\u000d\u000aOutlook (2010), on education and employment in the Financial Times (2011), and features on\u000d\u000alifetime employment for the New York Times (2011), achieving global syndication through the USA\u000d\u000a(International Herald Tribune, Gainesville Sun, etc.), Japan (IHT Asahi), Brazil (Terra), and India\u000d\u000a(Indian Express). Matanle is also engaging international broadcasters in shaping documentary\u000d\u000aproduction (BBC, 2013) and influencing media discourse in live television debates (NHK, 2010).\u000d\u000aRecently, Matanle developed this impact by speaking to the Economist Group's Tokyo Bureau\u000d\u000a(2013), using advanced knowledge to strengthen corporate executives' knowledge of Japan's\u000d\u000aregions and the recovery underway in Tohoku since the 3.11 disaster. The Director of the\u000d\u000aEconomist Corporate Network, said that `Dr. Matanle drew on his research ... and in doing so\u000d\u000acommunicated his deep knowledge and appreciation of the reality of regional and rural economies\u000d\u000ain Japan. ... attending members ... appreciated the opportunity to hear from an expert about the\u000d\u000areality of socio-economic conditions [and] left with a much clearer and balanced understanding of\u000d\u000athe issues at hand.' (S1).\u000d\u000a2. Government\u000d\u000aMatanle collaborated with UK and Japanese government institutions at regional and national levels\u000d\u000ain developing analyses and responses to emerging 21st century phenomena. For example, he\u000d\u000adeepened UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for Work and Pensions officials'\u000d\u000aunderstanding of the dynamics of Japan's regional development by framing this within a more\u000d\u000arobust empirical context, helping to revise expectations of the dynamics of East Asian development\u000d\u000ain the 21st century. Matanle's talk on Japan and China to this high-level government group was\u000d\u000a`informative, thought provoking, and enjoyable.... [I]t brought together colleagues from the FCO\u000d\u000aand other parts of government to discuss issues of common interest.... [S]uch cross-government\u000d\u000aworking will become even more important for the UK, partly as our economic interests look set to\u000d\u000abecome increasingly interconnected.' (S2)\u000d\u000aMatanle has also been instrumental in developing the activities and agendas of Japan's Council of\u000d\u000aLocal Authorities for International Relations (CLAIR), both directly and through its London office\u000d\u000a(Japan Local Government Centre &#8212; JLGC), nurturing mutually beneficial engagements through co-production\u000d\u000aof research and policy implementation. These include being invited to speak at the joint\u000d\u000aJLGC\/Derbyshire County Council Japan Day in 2008 and staging a joint symposium in Sheffield\u000d\u000awith the JLGC on `Shrinking Regions' (2008) which the former Director of JLGC said helped `in\u000d\u000adeveloping the JLGC's research and training activities in an area of policy that is of vital\u000d\u000aimportance to Japan's future' (S3), and participating with the JLGC on a co-produced research\u000d\u000aproject on `Intersecting Disasters in 21st Century East Asia (2013- ), which resulted in Matanle\u000d\u000abeing invited to write for Prospect magazine and which is feeding its results through to national and\u000d\u000aregional level policy-makers and other practitioners in Japan via the Ministry of Internal Affairs and\u000d\u000aCommunications (MIC) and CLAIR\/JLGC. Matanle was also invited to present his research to the\u000d\u000aMinister of Internal Affairs and Communications on the Minister's visit to London in 2012. The\u000d\u000aDirector of International Affairs of the Local Administration Bureau wrote to thank Matanle for his\u000d\u000a`valuable comments and ... kind cooperation [in a] very important exchange between the Japanese\u000d\u000aand UK sides'. In addition to the MIC and JLGC, other research participant-informants are the\u000d\u000aBritish Chamber of Commerce and Industry Japan, the Tokyo Planning Forum, the UK advocacy\u000d\u000agroup Population Matters (S4), and Japanese prefectural and municipal authorities.\u000d\u000a3. School and Citizen Groups\u000d\u000aAfter the tsunami on 11 March 2011, Matanle's research took on extra significance &#8212; Tohoku being\u000d\u000aa `Shrinking Region' &#8212; with his article for Local Environment (R6) leading to his participation at a\u000d\u000aseries of public events and him feeding into UK concerns about extreme environmental\u000d\u000adisturbances &#8212; such as flooding &#8212; in vulnerable communities. Beginning with an invitation to\u000d\u000apresent the Japan Society of the UK's Special Lecture to the Geographical Association, Matanle\u000d\u000ahas spoken to audiences of up to 1,000 delegates in London, Manchester, Harrogate, Lincoln,\u000d\u000aWimbledon, York, and Sheffield on post-disaster recovery in ageing and depopulating\u000d\u000acommunities. Collaborating with the JSUK has also led to planning joint delivery of a Continuing\u000d\u000aProfessional Development event in Sheffield (2014), for the first time outside of London. Matanle's\u000d\u000aresearch has helped attendees to connect with the experiences of people in Tohoku and enhanced\u000d\u000ateachers' and pupils' explanations of disaster hazards (S5). The Head of Humanities\/Geography at\u000d\u000aQueen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Horncastle, Lincolnshire: \"The talk you gave ... will form the\u000d\u000abasis of my teaching for the Japanese tsunami impacts this year.

Combining\u000d\u000aperspectives from economic sociology and cultural geography, he demonstrates the stability and\u000d\u000aresilience of the Japanese employment system as a distinct mode of economic organisation,\u000d\u000adespite pressure for reform amid rising affluence, a bifurcating labour force and ageing society,\u000d\u000aslower growth, and Japan's ongoing globalisation (R1, R2, R3). The research stands out by\u000d\u000aconsistently advocating that the system's durability lies in its capacity to satisfy employers' and\u000d\u000aemployees' long-term needs, and its deep roots within the socio-cultural imagination of Japanese\u000d\u000apeople. In pushing forward the literature he builds an empirically grounded and theoretically robust\u000d\u000achallenge to assertions that lifetime employment is under transformation, that socio-cultural\u000d\u000aexplanations for economic phenomena in Japan remain valid, and lifetime employment remains a\u000d\u000adefining characteristic of Japan's distinctive mode of capitalist organisation.\u000d\u000aFrom the mid-2000s, Matanle extended this research into exploring the regional dimensions of\u000d\u000aemployment systems in Japan by focusing attention on the change in the dynamic of development\u000d\u000abrought about by shrinkage of the national population in a highly centralised state focussed on\u000d\u000aTokyo (R4, R5). Via an ongoing process of spontaneous research co-production with end users,\u000d\u000ahis work tracks regional development processes and events as they happen, exhibiting rich\u000d\u000aempirical detail, both through aggregate statistical analysis as well as never-before understood\u000d\u000amicro-trends illuminated through painstaking case studies. Crucially, the research has important\u000d\u000aimplications for reconstruction and revival in post-tsunami Tohoku (R5, R6), as it reveals the\u000d\u000aimportance of employment as a stabilising factor in a region where a severe existential shock has\u000d\u000ataken place on top of experiencing the long term `disaster' of ageing, depopulation, and community\u000d\u000acollapse. His work has brought greater attention in the UK and internationally to Japan's rural-\u000d\u000aurban bifurcation, as well as local and national responses to extreme environmental disturbances,\u000d\u000aat a time when both the concept of a nation of `gaps' has entered the public discourse and the\u000d\u000adisasters of 11 March 2011 have exposed a severe national and regional socio-economic crisis.\u000d\u000aOn the one hand, a pro-growth strategy has been pursued by subnational actors seeking to\u000d\u000areverse processes of community collapse through government revitalisation interventions; on the\u000d\u000aother, however, national depopulation makes such strategies impossible to achieve for nearly all\u000d\u000aareas, especially Tohoku, as Tokyo continues to draw in people and resources and pull away from\u000d\u000athe rest of the country. Hence, a deepening fissure is emerging within the Japanese political\u000d\u000aeconomy between metropolitan and provincial regions, posing difficult challenges for the Japanese\u000d\u000agovernment and people, and demonstrating the potential for Japan's inter-regional dynamics to be\u000d\u000aunderstood as being indicative of post-developmental trends for the rest of East and Southeast\u000d\u000aAsia deep into the 21st century.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"3708","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In Zambia, Dr Cheeseman designed a democracy and accountability program\u000d\u000a      for DfID that\u000d\u000a      included a number of innovative policies to foster a more accountable and\u000d\u000a      responsive government.\u000d\u000a      This impact came about as a result of Dr Cheeseman's publications on\u000d\u000a      Zambia, political parties\u000d\u000a      and the challenges of cultivating effective accountability and legislative\u000d\u000a      scrutiny in new\u000d\u000a      democracies, and his experience of briefing the UK High Commissioner to\u000d\u000a      Zambia and his Deputy\u000d\u000a      in 2011-12. Relatively few scholars have worked on the political economy\u000d\u000a      of Zambia under the\u000d\u000a      Kaunda, Chiluba and now Sata administrations, and so Dr Cheeseman was\u000d\u000a      uniquely well suited to\u000d\u000a      the project. As a result, in May 2012, he was asked to draft a\u000d\u000a      multi-million pound Business Case to\u000d\u000a      guide DfID's democracy promotion activities in Zambia for the next five\u000d\u000a      years. As DfID Governance\u000d\u000a      Advisor Sam Waldock explains, `Nic's work on DFID Zambia Business Cases\u000d\u000a      helped us to analyse\u000d\u000a      the viability of proposed interventions and suggest a few new\u000d\u000a      interventions.'[1]\u000d\u000a    Following an assessment of a number of options identified by DfID Zambia,\u000d\u000a      Dr Cheeseman\u000d\u000a      conducted a period of fieldwork in July 2012. Based on this experience and\u000d\u000a      his prior research, he\u000d\u000a      recommended that DfID launch a Scorecard for MPs, through which Zambian\u000d\u000a      voters will be able to\u000d\u000a      access a summary of the activities of their MPs in key areas. A second new\u000d\u000a      proposal was to\u000d\u000a      provide training for the staff who operate MPs Constituency Offices for\u000d\u000a      the first time, enabling them\u000d\u000a      to better educate and serve their constituencies. A third strategy\u000d\u000a      proposed by Dr Cheeseman was\u000d\u000a      to provide think tanks for political parties to enable them to develop\u000d\u000a      more rounded and considered\u000d\u000a      manifestoes. This significantly expanded DfID's general framework for\u000d\u000a      democracy promotion\u000d\u000a      activities, which has very rarely engaged directly with political parties\u000d\u000a      to date. Taken together,\u000d\u000a      these policies represent an important evolution in the way that the UK\u000d\u000a      government conducts\u000d\u000a      democracy promotion activities in Zambia &#8212; a change that will provide\u000d\u000a      greater information to\u000d\u000a      citizens, strengthen ties of vertical accountability, and hence support\u000d\u000a      the evolution of a more\u000d\u000a      effective democracy in the long-run.\u000d\u000a    Similar work on the political economy of the new Patriotic Front (PF)\u000d\u000a      government that Dr\u000d\u000a      Cheeseman conducted in June 2012 as a consultant for the World Bank also\u000d\u000a      had a significant\u000d\u000a      impact, leading the Bank to adopt a more pragmatic approach in response to\u000d\u000a      the contradictions at\u000d\u000a      the heart of the PF's policy platform. According to Governance Officer\u000d\u000a      Kate Bridges, Dr\u000d\u000a      Cheeseman's work was `absolutely critical' to the development of the\u000d\u000a      Bank's Country Partnership\u000d\u000a      Strategy, and his `report has consistently been referred to ... The candid\u000d\u000a      diagnosis of the barriers\u000d\u000a      to effective donor intervention (particularly in key Bank sectors such as\u000d\u000a      agriculture, roads and\u000d\u000a      mining) has had a direct effect on the work plan that country staff\u000d\u000a      ultimately agreed upon and the\u000d\u000a      sectors we decided to prioritise. Nic's emphasis on the policy incoherence\u000d\u000a      and idiosyncratic\u000d\u000a      leadership ... led us to develop a CPS that has enshrined flexibility as a\u000d\u000a      core principle ... In short,\u000d\u000a      Nic's work has helped contribute to us having one of the most politically\u000d\u000a      responsive and aware\u000d\u000a      CPS strategies to date.'[2]\u000d\u000a    In Kenya, Dr Cheeseman's research both shaped the UK government's\u000d\u000a      approach to the 2013\u000d\u000a      general elections and strengthened the ties between academic research and\u000d\u000a      the policy process\u000d\u000a      more generally. This impact evolved out of a deep engagement with the UK\u000d\u000a      Foreign and\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth Office (FCO) over a number of years[3]. In 2009,\u000d\u000a      he delivered a workshop to the\u000d\u000a      Cabinet Office of the UK government on the prospects for unrest, and has\u000d\u000a      briefed every High\u000d\u000a      Commissioner to Kenya since 2008. These sessions led the FCO to ask Dr\u000d\u000a      Cheeseman to\u000d\u000a      organise and deliver a `Diplomatic Excellence Day' attended by the entire\u000d\u000a      Africa Directorate of the\u000d\u000a      FCO in Oxford in November 2011. Consistent policy engagement facilitated\u000d\u000a      the integration of\u000d\u000a      academic and policy communities, leading to further requests for academic\u000d\u000a      input on policy issues.\u000d\u000a      Based on this experience, Dr Cheeseman and two colleagues (Gabrielle Lynch\u000d\u000a      of Warwick\u000d\u000a      University and Justin Willis of Durham University) argued that, given the\u000d\u000a      potential for election\u000d\u000a      violence, donors required more systematic and longer-term academic\u000d\u000a      engagement ahead of the\u000d\u000a      2013 elections. The Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP) Programme of\u000d\u000a      the UK government &#8212;\u000d\u000a      which draws together DfID, the FCO and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) &#8212;\u000d\u000a      agreed and provided\u000d\u000a      almost &#163;70,000 to fund the project. The resulting `Early Warning and\u000d\u000a      Long-term Monitoring' project\u000d\u000a      brought together 10 British and Kenyan experts to conduct regular\u000d\u000a      fieldwork and draft and submit\u000d\u000a      monthly reports. Dr Cheeseman helped manage the project, drafted reports,\u000d\u000a      edited the work of\u000d\u000a      others, wrote executive summaries, and regularly presented the project's\u000d\u000a      findings to policy makers\u000d\u000a      in London and Nairobi. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first\u000d\u000a      time that an academic team\u000d\u000a      of this size has been systematically integrated into the UK's election\u000d\u000a      management strategy.\u000d\u000a    The project was deemed such a success that, in May 2013, the Foreign and\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth Office\u000d\u000a      asked Dr Cheeseman and his colleagues to apply for ESRC Knowledge Exchange\u000d\u000a      funding as Co-PIs\u000d\u000a      in order to extend the relationship and consider the policy lessons that\u000d\u000a      can be learnt from the\u000d\u000a      elections. Writing in support of that application, Political Officer\u000d\u000a      Tamsin Clayton noted that the\u000d\u000a      project had `met all of its aims and objectives' and that `reports and\u000d\u000a      discussions have informed\u000d\u000a      ACPP planning and policy advice regarding potential hotspots and the\u000d\u000a      credibility of forthcoming\u000d\u000a      elections by a) confirming existing knowledge, b) providing additional\u000d\u000a      detail and c) offering fresh\u000d\u000a      analysis. Two of the most significant contributions of this project have\u000d\u000a      been the geographic\u000d\u000a      coverage provided, which is difficult for London and Nairobi-based ACPP\u000d\u000a      staff to garner, and the\u000d\u000a      insightful analysis of potential conflict areas and the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      potential interventions, such\u000d\u000a      recommendations on areas to focus on going in to the election including\u000d\u000a      placement of international\u000d\u000a      election observers - and discussions regarding responses to different\u000d\u000a      election and post-election\u000d\u000a      scenarios.'[4]\u000d\u000a    More specifically, the advice of the academic team was important in\u000d\u000a      helping the UK government\u000d\u000a      identify likely locations of conflict. Dr Cheeseman argued that due to\u000d\u000a      different patterns of coalition\u000d\u000a      politics, inter-communal violence would not erupt on the same cleavage as\u000d\u000a      2007\/8. It was therefore\u000d\u000a      essential that the DfID, FCO, and MoD pay greater attention to Luo\u000d\u000a      communities living on tea\u000d\u000a      farms and along the borders with Kikuyu and Kalenjin communities. The\u000d\u000a      Early Warning project also\u000d\u000a      highlighted the danger posed by poor levels of voter education and the\u000d\u000a      mixed messages given by\u000d\u000a      the Electoral Commission, leading DfID to put greater pressure on the\u000d\u000a      Commission to use the\u000d\u000a      national media to explain the electoral process. In this way, the team\u000d\u000a      played a small role in\u000d\u000a      promoting a credible and peaceful process. The reports were considered to\u000d\u000a      be extremely valuable\u000d\u000a      to important policy decisions and so were shared with the donor and NGOs\u000d\u000a      community, most\u000d\u000a      notably with the US State Department and the National Democratic Institute\u000d\u000a      (NDI), from their\u000d\u000a      inception in December 2012 through to the end of the project in June 2013.\u000d\u000a      Writing to thank Dr\u000d\u000a      Cheeseman for his input during the election, Jonnie Carson, the Assistant\u000d\u000a      Secretary of State for\u000d\u000a      African Affairs (who reports directly to the US Secretary of State, Hilary\u000d\u000a      Clinton) wrote, `Many\u000d\u000a      thanks for including me on your running commentary of the Kenyan elections\u000d\u000a      ...

Project\u000d\u000a      findings were also shared with\u000d\u000a      the Dutch government through a presentation in the Hague.\u000d\u000a    Dr Cheeseman also shaped the findings of the Independent Review\u000d\u000a      Commission[i] (IREC &#8212; popularly\u000d\u000a      known as the Kriegler Commission), the official investigation into the\u000d\u000a      2007 elections\u000d\u000a      established by the Kenyan government in 2008. In part, the Commission\u000d\u000a      assessment on the extent\u000d\u000a      of electoral manipulation was guided by Dr Cheeseman's article in the Journal\u000d\u000a        of Eastern African\u000d\u000a        Studies &#8212; which was frequently cited in the final document &#8212; where\u000d\u000a      he argued that in many\u000d\u000a      constituencies the discrepancy between the vote for the ruling party in\u000d\u000a      the presidential and\u000d\u000a      parliamentary elections resulted from the presence of strong independent\u000d\u000a      candidates in\u000d\u000a      parliamentary contests. These candidates often drew support away the from\u000d\u000a      ruling party's\u000d\u000a      candidates, and it was often this, and not ballot box stuffing, that\u000d\u000a      explained why the ruling party did\u000d\u000a      better in the presidential election. The Commission also cited Dr\u000d\u000a      Cheeseman's work in support of\u000d\u000a      the conclusion that one of the main problems in the election was the lack\u000d\u000a      of independence of the\u000d\u000a      Electoral Commission. This was significant because the Kriegler\u000d\u000a      Commission's laid down the\u000d\u000a      blueprints for the design of a more autonomous electoral management body\u000d\u000a      ahead of the 2013\u000d\u000a      election. According to Jorgen Elklitt, the Secretary of the Commission,\u000d\u000a      `During this work it was very\u000d\u000a      useful for me &#8212; but also for the IREC Chair, Judge Johann Kriegler &#8212; to\u000d\u000a      have access to the special\u000d\u000a      issue of the Journal of Eastern African Studies of which Dr\u000d\u000a      Cheeseman was a guest editor.

In Kenya, his work shaped the findings of the official Kreigler\u000d\u000a      Commission, whose report\u000d\u000a      on the controversial elections of 2007 led to the restructuring of the\u000d\u000a      electoral commission.

His work on political parties\u000d\u000a      in Zambia demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that even in ethnically diverse societies, political leaders could still\u000d\u000a      mobilize large support bases by\u000d\u000a      crafting programmatic policies and harnessing them to populist political\u000d\u000a      machines (2008b; 2013).\u000d\u000a      He also demonstrated that, in contrast to much of the literature which\u000d\u000a      suggests that African politics\u000d\u000a      can be treated as an `ethnic census', Zambian political leaders were so\u000d\u000a      concerned about public\u000d\u000a      opinion that they regularly changed their positions on key policy issues\u000d\u000a      in response to the policy\u000d\u000a      proposals of rival parties and the public mood (2008b). Research conducted\u000d\u000a      for the International\u000d\u000a      Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) as\u000d\u000a      part of a &#163;20,000\u000d\u000a      research project went further, and suggested that, in many African\u000d\u000a      countries, there were untapped\u000d\u000a      `programmatic constituencies' that could be mobilized by parties. Finally,\u000d\u000a      research as part of a\u000d\u000a      &#163;700,000 UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant on\u000d\u000a      executive-legislative\u000d\u000a      relations in new democracies found that contrary to conventional wisdom,\u000d\u000a      many African presidents\u000d\u000a      lack secure legislative majorities. As a result, they must deploy a range\u000d\u000a      of legislative `tools' such as\u000d\u000a      patronage to pass legislation, which in turn generates a number of\u000d\u000a      negative externalities,\u000d\u000a      undermining the development of durable political parties and the quality\u000d\u000a      of legislative scrutiny and\u000d\u000a      thus harming the prospects for democratization (2013).\u000d\u000a    The combination of this research led Dr Cheeseman to argue that African\u000d\u000a      politics could be made\u000d\u000a      more `programmatic' or `policy based' by increasing the information\u000d\u000a      available to citizens regarding\u000d\u000a      the activities and performance of their MPs, strengthening the ties of\u000d\u000a      communication between\u000d\u000a      citizens and representatives, and enhancing the policy capacity of\u000d\u000a      political parties. He therefore\u000d\u000a      advocated that donors should enhance the information available to citizens\u000d\u000a      about their\u000d\u000a      representatives and assist political parties to enable them to better\u000d\u000a      anticipate and respond to\u000d\u000a      popular concerns.\u000d\u000a    Dr Cheeseman also conducted research on elections and violence. Combining\u000d\u000a      testimony from\u000d\u000a      those on the ground in Kenya with theories of state collapse, he\u000d\u000a      identified four processes that had\u000d\u000a      led to post-election violence in Kenya in 2008: the creation of rigid\u000d\u000a      communal identities, the\u000d\u000a      informalization of state institutions, the evolution of a deeply divided\u000d\u000a      political elite, and the gradual\u000d\u000a      diffusion of capacity for violence to non-state actors such as militias\u000d\u000a      (2009). He also explained the\u000d\u000a      pattern of voting by showing that while rigging had occurred, it had not\u000d\u000a      done so on the scale\u000d\u000a      alleged by the opposition (2008a). This research and the special issue of\u000d\u000a      the Journal of Eastern\u000d\u000a      African Studies that Dr Cheeseman co-edited with Daniel Branch (Warwick\u000d\u000a      University) shaped how\u000d\u000a      the `Kenya crisis' came to be understood.\u000d\u000a    In related work, Dr Cheeseman found that that one of the most important\u000d\u000a      factors in explaining\u000d\u000a      turnover is whether or not the sitting president contests the polls\u000d\u000a      (published in Journal of\u000d\u000a        Democracy 2010). When this is not the case&#8212;and there is therefore an\u000d\u000a      `open-seat' election&#8212;the\u000d\u000a      opposition is 33% more likely to win. These finding enabled Dr Cheeseman\u000d\u000a      to develop a\u000d\u000a      framework for assessing when elections were most likely to result in a\u000d\u000a      change of power and\u000d\u000a      electoral violence. On the basis of this research, Dr Cheeseman argued\u000d\u000a      that the 2013 Kenyan\u000d\u000a      elections, in which the incumbent cannot stand, had the potential to lead\u000d\u000a      to an opposition victory\u000d\u000a      and so would be particularly prone to electoral violence.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3709","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In 2009, five elderly Kenyans lodged a claim against the British\u000a      government for the abuse they experienced in the Mau Mau internment camps,\u000a      where they had been tortured, beaten, castrated and subjected to extreme\u000a      sexual violence. They were backed by the Kenya Human Rights Commission,\u000a      which considered Professor Anderson's work, alongside that of Professor\u000a      Caroline Elkins at Harvard University, as having `changed our\u000a      understanding of this period of history'[i]. Professor\u000a      Anderson joined the plaintiffs' legal team in 2010 to provide expert\u000a      testimony, alongside Professor Elkins and Dr Huw Bennett of Aberystwyth\u000a      University. The contribution of Professor Anderson's research lay in the\u000a      documentary record of the colonial administration. On the basis of\u000a      indications in his research that around 300 files were missing from the\u000a      archival record[ii: &#167;32], the High Court ordered the\u000a      British government to conduct a search that eventually revealed some 8,800\u000a      hidden files from 37 former British territories, concealed for fifty\u000a      years. This public revelation has prompted a heated debate between\u000a      historians who recognise the need to reconsider the history of the end of\u000a      empire.\u000a    In July 2011, Justice McCombe ruled that the documentary research had\u000a      demonstrated `viable evidence' for a trial. On this basis, he declared\u000a      that it would be `dishonourable' for the British legal system not to\u000a      consider a case alleging the use of torture by the British government\u000a      since `there is ample evidence even in the few papers that I have seen\u000a      suggesting that there may have been systematic torture of detainees', and\u000a      he duly refused the government plea for the case to be struck off[ii:\u000a          &#167;125, &#167;130, &#167;134, &#167;154]. In the subsequent preliminary\u000a      hearing in July 2012, the government made the historic acknowledgement\u000a      that Kenyans were indeed tortured and abused under the colonial\u000a      administration. Professor Anderson presented further research on the\u000a      institutional sanctioning of torture and the obstruction of the judicial\u000a      process during the Emergency, research that Justice McCombe considered as\u000a      indicating `a continuing pattern of abusive conduct'[iii: &#167;128].\u000a      Justice McCombe granted the plaintiffs leave to claim compensation from\u000a      the British government, and on 6 June 2013 a settlement was announced.\u000a      Recognising the crimes of the past with statements in the House of Commons\u000a      and in Kenya, the British government will pay compensation of around &#163;13.9\u000a      million, comprising of payments of &#163;2,600 each to around 5,000 survivors\u000a      of colonial torture, and will finance the construction of a memorial in\u000a      Kenya[iv]. According to Dan Leader, lead barrister for\u000a      the plaintiffs, without Professor Anderson's identification of the missing\u000a      archive material and `meticulous' research on it, `the claims would not\u000a      have succeeded'[1, v].\u000a    The court case and Professor Anderson's research in particular sparked\u000a      significant public debates in Kenya and the UK. British newspapers were\u000a      pressed by the publication of Histories of the Hanged to consider\u000a      the country's responsibility for extraordinary crimes and its attitude to\u000a      its own past.[vi] Explicit parallels raised by Professor\u000a      Anderson's research were debated in the British press as challenging\u000a      lessons for the contemporary scandals surrounding British and American\u000a      counter- insurgency strategies and the use and cover-up of torture in\u000a      Guant&#225;namo Bay[vii]. Kenyan debates, meanwhile, were\u000a      prompted by the research to confront the country's own divided history\u000a      over the position of Mau Mau veterans and other nationalist movements[viii].\u000a      Inspired by the research on the Mau Mau executions, the commentator\u000a      Muthoni Wanyeki further opened the debate out to question Kenya's modern\u000a      reluctance to abolish the death penalty, its experience of extrajudicial\u000a      killings and the abuses of security services[2, ix].\u000a    Professor Anderson's research and the High Court case propelled public\u000a      reconsideration of relations between the UK, Kenya and the world. On the\u000a      basis of the evidence of brutal torture and cynical institutional\u000a      deception, Archbishop Desmond Tutu publicly urged a moral confrontation\u000a      with the past as an imperative for the British government to set aside its\u000a      `hypocrisy' and restore its international reputation as a champion for\u000a      human rights[x]. While the controversy of the\u000a      revelations of the research and the outcome of the trial remain explosive,\u000a      the Kenyan journalist Gitau Warigi subsequently wrote of the significance\u000a      of Professor Anderson's research for the international image of the\u000a      British, since `one of their own' had pursued research that substantiated\u000a      British ideals of justice and fair play by uncovering where these ideals\u000a      had been betrayed[xi]. This research into the dirty\u000a      history of the Mau Mau Emergency drove the judicial search for justice and\u000a      involved the public in widespread debate over historical truth, guilt,\u000a      national values, and the links between Britain and her former colonies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Mau Mau Emergency at the end of empire in Kenya saw atrocities on all\u000a      sides and extensive torture under the British administration.

First joining Oxford University as a\u000a      Lecturer in African Studies in 2002, he was appointed Professor in African\u000a      Politics in 2006. From 2006 to 2009, he also served as the Director of the\u000a      University's African Studies Centre. He left the University in January\u000a      2013.\u000a    When Professor Anderson began at Oxford, his research focused on the\u000a      history and politics of colonial Kenya, particularly on the Mau Mau\u000a      Emergency of the 1950s. The Emergency began in 1952, when a subterranean\u000a      nationalist organisation known to the European colonists as `Mau Mau',\u000a      largely drawn from the Kikuyu ethnic group, began brutal assassinations,\u000a      primarily of Africans believed to be collaborating with British rule. The\u000a      colonial administration embarked on a campaign of repressive military\u000a      operations in the rural districts around Nairobi accompanied by\u000a      large-scale internment of Kikuyu in order to determine their Mau Mau\u000a      sympathies. While the colonial administration won the war by the late\u000a      1950s, it heralded the end of British rule in Kenya. Independence was\u000a      achieved in 1963.\u000a    Professor Anderson conducted archival research in Nairobi in 2003, where\u000a      he explored the judicial records of capital punishment during the\u000a      Emergency. His research revealed the startling statistic that, at 1,090\u000a      executions, the British administration put to death far more people than\u000a      France during the brutal independence war in Algeria. Professor Anderson\u000a      employed the detailed records of these trials to write the first robust\u000a      general history of the Mau Mau war, published in 2005. It tells the story\u000a      from all sides, nationalist and loyalist, rural and urban, to reveal the\u000a      vicious crimes and complex intricacies of the conflict, and the impact of\u000a      `Britain's dirty war' on Kenya's subsequent history.\u000a    A key aspect of this historical legacy was the complexity among Kenyans\u000a      at the time, research revealing both the extreme brutality committed by\u000a      some loyalist Kikuyu against Mau Mau suspects, as well as the loyalists'\u000a      own fears and complex relationship to British rule. The research drew\u000a      vital attention to the divisions within nationalist politics that led to\u000a      the first Prime Minister of independent Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, maintaining\u000a      the outlaw status of Mau Mau after the departure of the British. With Mau\u000a      Mau remaining a controversial subject in Kenya as in Britain, this\u000a      prohibition was only lifted by the Kenyan government in 2003.\u000a    Most importantly, however, research around the capital punishment cases\u000a      demonstrated the brutal crimes committed in the course of insurgent\u000a      warfare and repression, from massacres, rape and murder to signs of\u000a      torture and cover-up in the internment camps. When his research prompted\u000a      the revelatory release of hundreds of files hidden by the British\u000a      government, Professor Anderson led a research team of Oxford University\u000a      graduate students that demonstrated from these files that the colonial\u000a      administration and British government knew well of torture in the\u000a      internment camps, encouraged an atmosphere of impunity for their agents,\u000a      concealed known cases of rape and murder, and manipulated the\u000a      investigative and judicial process to obstruct the course of justice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4879","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"51537","Name":"Somalia"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    By informing the debate concerning khat policy in the UK and elsewhere,\u000d\u000a      Carrier's research affects a wide range of beneficiaries. Firstly, the\u000d\u000a      report for the Home Office, Khat: Social Harms and Legislation, a\u000d\u000a        Literature Review, has benefitted the UK Home Office and ACMD (UK\u000d\u000a      Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs), providing much needed context\u000d\u000a      for the question of khat policy. Secondly, the publication of this Home\u000d\u000a      Office report has given the general public free access to material vital\u000d\u000a      to the debate. Thirdly, by informing policy, his work will potentially\u000d\u000a      impact the lives of many, both in the UK and in East Africa. Regarding the\u000d\u000a      former, his work highlights the need for policy makers to focus on the\u000d\u000a      wider social context in which problematic khat consumption is embedded.\u000d\u000a      Regarding East Africa, by emphasizing the importance of khat as a cash\u000d\u000a      crop in East Africa Carrier's work has ensured policy makers are aware of\u000d\u000a      the implications of UK policy for farmers and exporters in Ethiopia and\u000d\u000a      Kenya. While the government has announced a ban on khat to be enforced in\u000d\u000a      the near future, Carrier's research and its impact on the recommendations\u000d\u000a      of the ACMD played and continue to play a major role in the debate.\u000d\u000a    On the basis of their track record of researching the substance, Carrier\u000d\u000a      and Professor David Anderson (the PI of the Khat Nexus project who\u000d\u000a      has recently moved from the African Studies Centre to a new post at the\u000d\u000a      University of Warwick) were contacted by the Home Office in 2009 with\u000d\u000a      regard to writing a review of the available literature regarding khat's\u000d\u000a      purported `social harms' and the history and impact of legislation in\u000d\u000a      European and North American countries. The Home Office were focusing on\u000d\u000a      social harms, as medical harms connected to khat were well covered in the\u000d\u000a      existing literature. Carrier and Anderson tendered a bid for the\u000d\u000a      literature review and were commissioned to write it: the review was\u000d\u000a      published by the Home Office in 2011[1, i].\u000d\u000a    This was the first piece of research to conduct in-depth analysis of the\u000d\u000a      history of khat prohibition in European and North American countries. It\u000d\u000a      highlights the lack of evidence-based policy in these countries and the\u000d\u000a      mixed and contradictory nature of the evidence for social harm, as well as\u000d\u000a      the lack of attention given to the wider social problems faced by the\u000d\u000a      Somali population in the UK that are crucial in understanding the impact\u000d\u000a      of khat. It also drew the attention of policy makers to the government's\u000d\u000a      revenue collection from the import of khat, which now amounts to over &#163;2\u000d\u000a      million annually.\u000d\u000a    This report allowed the findings of Carrier's long-term research on khat\u000d\u000a      to be placed at the heart of the khat policy debate in the UK. The review\u000d\u000a      has been cited in other publications, has been reposted on several\u000d\u000a      websites, and its findings have even been translated into Norwegian. Its\u000d\u000a      coverage in newspaper articles and approaches made to Carrier by\u000d\u000a      journalists suggest that it is circulating widely. Most importantly, the\u000d\u000a      report has directly informed the recently published Advisory Council on\u000d\u000a      the Misuse of Drugs recommendations on khat[ii]. These\u000d\u000a      recommendations cite the literature review substantially and draw upon\u000d\u000a      many of its findings. Carrier's research into khat is therefore of great\u000d\u000a      significance in informing the khat debate in the UK. It has enabled the\u000d\u000a      ACMD to make much more informed recommendations to the Home Office.\u000d\u000a      Professor Les Iversen, the Chair of the ACMD[2], is\u000d\u000a      prepared to corroborate the strong role the literature review played in\u000d\u000a      the ACMD's recommendations, while Will Reynolds[3] (Head\u000a      of the Home Office Advisory Bodies) corroborates the research thus:\u000d\u000a    Dr Carrier and Professor Anderson provided, to the Home Office, a\u000d\u000a        report: Khat: Social harms and legislation - A literature review. The\u000d\u000a        review was integral to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs'\u000d\u000a        consideration of khat which was directly commissioned by the Home\u000d\u000a        Secretary. In requesting the review the Home Secretary indicated\u000d\u000a        particular interest in better understanding the social harms of khat.\u000d\u000a        The report therefore provided policy makers, through the ACMD's\u000d\u000a        consideration of the wider evidence base in its report, with key\u000d\u000a        evidence that has supported the Government's decision making process.\u000d\u000a        The final decision, made by Ministers, will have high media profile -\u000d\u000a        irrespective of outcome. If the decision is taken to control khat, it is\u000d\u000a        likely that there will be significant consideration and reference to the\u000d\u000a        social harms of khat and the ACMD report at Parliamentary level.\u000d\u000a    Without the literature review, policy makers would have been unaware that\u000d\u000a      much legislation against khat around the world was actually based on\u000d\u000a      little evidence, while also being ill-informed on much of the context\u000d\u000a      surrounding the khat issue in the UK. Carrier and David Anderson also\u000d\u000a      addressed the ACMD in February 2012 and presented their findings to the\u000d\u000a      review committee, which Anderson has subsequently joined. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      Carrier has liaised with journalists regarding the literature review, most\u000d\u000a      recently being contacted by a BBC radio producer regarding a documentary\u000d\u000a      being made about khat. Carrier was interviewed and quoted by Howard Swains\u000d\u000a      in an article about the current khat debate in The Independent (30th\u000d\u000a\u0009  June 2012)[iii]. This article was discussed in\u000d\u000a      the House of Lords, with specific remarks by Lord Avebury on 19 July 2012[iv].\u000d\u000a    A blog post by Carrier on the nature of claims that khat proceeds are\u000d\u000a      funding terrorism has also drawn much internet traffic[v].\u000d\u000a      In June 2012, Carrier was interviewed by Italian film-makers[4]\u000d\u000a      producing a film about khat[vi]. Carrier has been\u000d\u000a      recruited by the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs onto a team of\u000d\u000a      experts monitoring the response of the UK government to the ACMD's\u000d\u000a      recommendations. Finally, Carrier's work has had policy impact beyond the\u000d\u000a      UK, e.g. it was cited in an Australian report on khat in the state of\u000d\u000a      Victoria, which successfully advised the state government not to ban the\u000d\u000a      substance[vii].\u000d\u000a    Following the announcement in July 2013 of the government's intention to\u000d\u000a      ban khat, Carrier published an online article for Think Africa Press\u000d\u000a      further emphasizing the need to consider the impact on East African\u000d\u000a      farmers and traders[viii]. Kenyan khat farmer\u000d\u000a      organisations are now seeking to bring a case against the British\u000d\u000a      government's decision with funding from the Kenyan government: Carrier has\u000d\u000a      been approached by the legal firm developing the case to offer advice.\u000d\u000a      Thus, the government's decision to ban the substance does not mark the end\u000d\u000a      of the debate, and Carrier's research continues to be of relevance.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, by going against the ACMD advice, the government has sparked\u000d\u000a      a wider debate on the role of expert advice and government policy:\u000d\u000a      Carrier's research has helped facilitate debate beyond the single issue of\u000d\u000a      khat.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Carrier's research and publications have had a strong impact on UK public\u000d\u000a      and policy debate surrounding the stimulant drug khat - the stems and\u000d\u000a      leaves of the shrub `Catha edulis' that have been consumed for centuries\u000d\u000a      in East Africa and the Middle East and are now imported in large\u000d\u000a      quantities to the UK. In particular, this research has been influential in\u000d\u000a      shaping the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs' recommendations to\u000d\u000a      the Government, published in January 2013. The Oxford research has played\u000d\u000a      a significant role in highlighting the potential negative impact of the\u000d\u000a      ban on farmers in East Africa, and though the government announced in July\u000d\u000a      2013 that it would not be following the Council's recommendations that\u000d\u000a      khat not be prohibited, an argument remains urging the generation of\u000d\u000a      ameliorative measures to mitigate this negative impact of UK policy.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Oxford\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aNeil Carrier and Gernot Klantschnig, 2012, Africa and the War on\u000d\u000a        Drugs, Zed Books.

Though the UK government\u000d\u000a      decided not to legislate against it in 2006, various lobby groups\u000d\u000a      continued to pressure the government to ban it, with further influence\u000d\u000a      from other countries in the West (especially the USA) for the UK to ban\u000d\u000a      its import (as the UK is a major transit hub for khat smuggled to North\u000d\u000a      America and Scandinavia). Most countries in Europe and North America had\u000d\u000a      already banned its import and consumption, making the UK, Australia and\u000d\u000a      Netherlands out of step with these countries. This pressure led the UK\u000d\u000a      government in 2009 to undertake new reviews of khat in which Carrier\u000d\u000a      participated. The circumstances surrounding khat are complicated, as many\u000d\u000a      commentators oppose a ban on various grounds, while consuming communities\u000d\u000a      in the diaspora are far from unified on the need for prohibition or of its\u000d\u000a      harm potential, and producing regions in East Africa are likely to suffer\u000d\u000a      from changes to legislation in the UK and Netherlands in particular.\u000d\u000a    The research underpinning this impact was undertaken at the African\u000d\u000a      Studies Centre, Oxford, as part of a large, cross-institutional AHRC \/\u000d\u000a      ESRC-funded project entitled The Khat Nexus: Transnational Consumption\u000d\u000a        in a Global Economy. Neil Carrier - now Departmental Lecturer in\u000d\u000a      African Anthropology at Oxford - was the postdoctoral researcher on the\u000d\u000a      project, which was based in Oxford, but also involved scholars from other\u000d\u000a      institutions (David Anderson, University of Oxford, Susan Beckerleg,\u000d\u000a      University of Warwick, Degol Hailu, SOAS, and Axel Klein, DrugScope). It\u000d\u000a      examined the growth of khat's importance as a cash crop in East Africa,\u000d\u000a      its growing consumption in that region, and the transnational trade that\u000d\u000a      has emerged in recent decades to feed demand in diaspora communities of\u000d\u000a      Somalis, Yemenis and Ethiopians in the West. Its findings helped inform\u000d\u000a      the UK government's decision not to prohibit the substance in 2006 after a\u000d\u000a      review of its potential harms. Carrier continued his research into the\u000d\u000a      substance as an ESRC postdoctoral Fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford\u000d\u000a      (2005-6), and more recently as a Research Fellow and Departmental Lecturer\u000d\u000a      at the African Studies Centre (2009 onwards). Carrier has produced two\u000d\u000a      books resulting from the research - Kenyan Khat: The social life of a\u000d\u000a        stimulant (Brill: 2007) and Africa and the War on Drugs,\u000d\u000a      published by Zed in October 2012 - and a number of single and co-authored\u000d\u000a      articles, as well as a co-authored Home Office report (see below).\u000d\u000a    The research insights and findings relating to the case study's impact\u000d\u000a      derive from ethnographic and historical research carried out on the\u000d\u000a      production, consumption and trade of the substance in East Africa and the\u000d\u000a      west. These insights relate to the economic importance of the crop for\u000d\u000a      African livelihoods, its cultural and social significance for consumers\u000d\u000a      around the world, and the impact of policy, in particular legislation\u000d\u000a      against the substance in Europe, North America and Australia. First, this\u000d\u000a      research uncovered the economic significance of the khat economy for\u000d\u000a      farmers in East Africa, as well as for exporters and importers around the\u000d\u000a      world. While the crop has its economic downsides, in the main it has\u000d\u000a      provided livelihoods for farmers and traders at times when other\u000d\u000a      cash-crops have failed them. Second, the research has emphasized the\u000d\u000a      social and cultural significance of khat consumption. While khat is blamed\u000d\u000a      for many social ills affecting diaspora communities in the west, our\u000d\u000a      research has shown that it is too simplistic to attribute these problems\u000d\u000a      to khat alone. Our analysis of the social effects of khat in the UK\u000d\u000a      suggests that evidence for khat being the cause of a range of social harms\u000d\u000a      is mixed and contradictory. Third, this research shows that policy enacted\u000d\u000a      to prohibit the commodity in various European and North American countries\u000d\u000a      has not been evidence-based, and has led to a thriving trade in smuggled\u000d\u000a      khat. These research findings are crucial to the khat debate, and\u000d\u000a      informing the public and policy debate in the UK and elsewhere of these\u000d\u000a      findings is the key aspect of the research impact.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4880","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In recent years, there have been major changes in both Japanese central\u000d\u000a      and local child welfare\u000d\u000a      policy and legislation, culminating in 2010 in the publication by the\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Health, Labour and\u000d\u000a      Welfare (MHLW) of the `2010 Vision for Children and Childrearing' which\u000d\u000a      advocates: much greater\u000d\u000a      use of adoption and fostering, greater investment in keeping birth\u000d\u000a      families together, and the\u000d\u000a      massive reduction in the average size of residential units for children in\u000d\u000a      care. The impact that the\u000d\u000a      research undertaken by Goodman had on the debates which led to these\u000d\u000a      reforms was due to the\u000d\u000a      fact that his was the only research written by a foreign scholar on this\u000d\u000a      topic (foreign scholars are\u000d\u000a      often drawn on in internal policy debates in Japan) and that it became\u000d\u000a      widely disseminated in\u000d\u000a      Japan after it was translated by one of Japan's leading child welfare\u000d\u000a      policy-makers, Tetsuo\u000d\u000a      Tsuzaki. Beyond its policy impact, Goodman's book Nihon no Jid&#333;y&#333;go\u000d\u000a      (see above) has become a\u000d\u000a      textbook on many social work courses in Japanese universities[1,\u000d\u000a          2], and his research has helped\u000d\u000a      raise public consciousness in Japan on the rise of reported rates of child\u000d\u000a      abuse (see for example:\u000d\u000a      Roger Goodman, 2000, `Jid&#333; Gyakutai no \"Hakken\" to Senmonka no Fuzai' [The\u000d\u000a      `Discovery' of\u000d\u000a      Child Abuse and the Shortage of Specialists], Asahi Shinbun, 29\u000d\u000a      May, which was a specially\u000d\u000a      invited column in the Asahi newspaper, daily circulation 11.4 million.)\u000d\u000a    1 Political, administrative and practical impacts\u000d\u000a    Since its publication in Japanese, this research has been drawn on in\u000d\u000a    relation to a number of major\u000d\u000a    recent changes in Japanese state policy for looked-after children and young\u000d\u000a    people. Collectively,\u000d\u000a    these reforms presage a radical change from the situation described in the\u000d\u000a    research in the late\u000d\u000a    1990s where 90% of children lived in children's homes with, on average, over\u000d\u000a    sixty residents. In\u000d\u000a    future, one-third of children and young people in state care will be placed\u000d\u000a    in foster homes, one-third\u000d\u000a    in community group homes and one-third in children's homes[i].\u000d\u000a    In relation to the last of these, the\u000d\u000a    Ministry also determined that, within a decade, no children's homes will\u000d\u000a    house more than 40\u000d\u000a    children in total. Several local governments have recently set up local\u000d\u000a    initiatives to increase the\u000d\u000a    number of placements in fostering while reducing those in children's homes;\u000d\u000a    the proportion of\u000d\u000a    looked-after children in foster homes in Fukuoka, which was only 6.9% in\u000d\u000a    2004, had increased to\u000d\u000a    24.8% by 2010.\u000d\u000a    Many MPs and local politicians in Japan have begun to argue for greater\u000d\u000a      opportunities for this\u000d\u000a      disadvantaged group in Japanese society and for an improvement in\u000d\u000a      provisions for care leavers,\u000d\u000a      including housing, training and income maintenance. Until recently,\u000d\u000a      children have had to leave care\u000d\u000a      homes as soon as they left full-time education (which can be as young as\u000d\u000a      16). Recent policy now\u000d\u000a      defines `looked-after children' as under 18 years old, which can be\u000d\u000a      extended to under 20 years old\u000d\u000a      if it is necessary, and a ministry administrative notice states that\u000d\u000a      children with disability can stay\u000d\u000a      longer than 20 years old[ii].\u000d\u000a    Greater awareness of all the above issues has been aided by the Japanese\u000d\u000a      version of Goodman's\u000d\u000a      book published in 2006. MPs from the Social Democratic Party (when it was\u000d\u000a      in opposition) referred\u000d\u000a      to the work as evidence in the Committee Session on Children's Social\u000d\u000a      Care, including Hosaka\u000d\u000a      Nobuto who is now the Mayor of Setagaya Ward in the Tokyo Metropolitan\u000d\u000a      Council, which has\u000d\u000a      taken a lead in this area.\u000d\u000a    Tetsuo Tsuzaki is a member of numerous government advisory panels on\u000d\u000a      child protection issues\u000d\u000a      and probably the best known scholar in Japan working on issues of Japanese\u000d\u000a      child protection. He\u000d\u000a      has stated that:\u000d\u000a    \"Professor Goodman's social anthropological work on Japan's orphanage\u000d\u000a        system has had\u000d\u000a        enormous impact on child welfare policy as well as on academic world.\u000d\u000a        Prior to his work academic\u000d\u000a        research into indigenous management of orphanages was virtually taboo in\u000d\u000a        children's social care\u000d\u000a        field across Japan. His work set out a sort of climate in which more\u000d\u000a        open discussion and research\u000d\u000a        should be undertaken amongst people concerned. His elaborate research\u000d\u000a        into what went on in\u000d\u000a        Japan's orphanages was shocking as well as revealing not only to\u000d\u000a        academics but also to\u000d\u000a        administrators in central and local governments.... To sum up, his work\u000d\u000a        has been widely or\u000d\u000a        universally cited in any serious research into Japan's children's social\u000d\u000a        care policy and practice and\u000d\u000a        it shall be providing the lasting impact on policy and researches of\u000d\u000a        child welfare, particularly of the\u000d\u000a        best interests of children and young persons deprived of normal family\u000d\u000a        life in Japan for at least next\u000d\u000a        quarter a century\"[3].\u000d\u000a    According to Toshikazu Takahashi, Chairman of the Japanese Society for\u000d\u000a      Residential Child Care:\u000d\u000a    \"Professor Goodman's work, especially the book, Nihon no Jid&#333;y&#333;go\u000d\u000a        (undertaken from the\u000d\u000a        perspective of an external and neutral observer), has been widely read\u000d\u000a        and had a major impact on\u000d\u000a        the way that both practitioners and policy-makers in Japan have looked\u000d\u000a        at the system of child\u000d\u000a        protection. It significantly influenced the terms of the debate which\u000d\u000a        led, most recently, to the 2010\u000d\u000a        policy changes in Japan for children in care\"[4].\u000d\u000a    The Japan Bar Association drew on Goodman's research in their argument\u000d\u000a      for the better treatment\u000d\u000a      of children in care and for the need for Japan to sign up to the UN\u000d\u000a      Convention on the Rights of the\u000d\u000a      Child.

The study was\u000d\u000a      based on intensive participant observation and extended interviews, and it\u000d\u000a      showed that, in Japan,\u000d\u000a      when compared to the OECD average: (a) a very high proportion (around 90%)\u000d\u000a      of children go into\u000d\u000a      residential care as opposed to adoption and fostering; (b) when children\u000d\u000a      are taken into care, they\u000d\u000a      tend to stay in the care system for a long period of time (over five years\u000d\u000a      on average); (c) while in\u000d\u000a      care, they are cared for in large groups and achieve less educationally,\u000d\u000a      socially and emotionally\u000d\u000a      than their peers in the wider society.\u000d\u000a    The research also concluded that the operation of the Japanese system was\u000d\u000a      the result of a number\u000d\u000a      of social phenomena which would all be susceptible to change if the\u000d\u000a      political will existed. These\u000d\u000a      social phenomena included: the difficulties for the authorities in\u000d\u000a      mobilizing alternatives to\u000d\u000a      residential care such as fostering and adoption due to the meanings\u000d\u000a      historically ascribed to these\u000d\u000a      practices in the traditional Japanese kinship system; the vested interests\u000d\u000a      of the private welfare\u000d\u000a      organisations which ran the children's homes; the general lack of public\u000d\u000a      awareness of the child\u000d\u000a      protection system; and the fact that current practices were considered to\u000d\u000a      be the `natural'\u000d\u000a      outgrowths of historical and traditional cultural patterns. The study\u000d\u000a      placed particular emphasis on\u000d\u000a      the fact that, over the past twenty years, there has been huge growth in\u000d\u000a      the number of reported\u000d\u000a      cases of child abuse (from 1,000 in 1991 to over 50,000 in 2011), an issue\u000d\u000a      which had thus far been\u000d\u000a      virtually dismissed in Japan as a `western' social problem. The research\u000d\u000a      explained in detail the\u000d\u000a      reasons for this huge increase and why it necessitated a complete\u000d\u000a      re-examination of the\u000d\u000a      assumptions which had underlain the Japanese child protection system\u000d\u000a      hitherto.\u000d\u000a    All the research was carried out by Roger Goodman. In 1991, when Goodman\u000d\u000a      was at the\u000d\u000a      University of Essex, he undertook a pilot project to test the feasibility\u000d\u000a      of the research. After moving\u000d\u000a      full-time to Oxford in 1993, he made a series of short fieldwork trips\u000d\u000a      before undertaking the major\u000d\u000a      research in Japan over 12 months in 1997-98. The research was funded by\u000d\u000a      two competitive grants,\u000d\u000a      which covered a year of fieldwork and a year for writing-up, from the\u000d\u000a      Japan Society for the\u000d\u000a      Promotion of Science (a government agency) and the Japanese Ministry of\u000d\u000a      Education,\u000d\u000a      respectively. The main findings were published in English by Oxford\u000d\u000a      University Press in 2000 and\u000d\u000a      in a widely-disseminated Japanese version by Akashi Shoten (the major\u000d\u000a      publisher of works on\u000d\u000a      Japanese social welfare policy and practice) in 2006. The translation of\u000d\u000a      the Japanese version was\u000d\u000a      undertaken by Tetsuo Tsuzaki, one of the key policy-makers in child\u000d\u000a      welfare issues in Japan, who\u000d\u000a      has in turn been one of the main conduits for disseminating the results of\u000d\u000a      the research to other\u000d\u000a      major Japanese policy-makers.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8846","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6254930","Name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Goodman's research insights - conveyed to a wide audience\u000a      through numerous public lectures, his involvement in the creation of the\u000a      third episodes of the BBC series Ancient Rome: the Rise and Fall of an\u000a        Empire and the BBC documentary Mothers, Murderers and Mistresses,\u000a      and especially as detailed in Rome and Jerusalem which has been\u000a      widely read outside academia - challenge many common assumptions about the\u000a      history of anti-Semitism and the history of the policy of western powers\u000a      toward Palestine, and so have influenced the public understanding of\u000a      contemporary issues related to the Middle East, as well as the public\u000a      understanding of religious communities in a multicultural and civil\u000a      society.\u000a    Goodman's book Rome and Jerusalem continues to sell well with\u000a      over 35000 editions sold in hardback, paperback and ebook format across\u000a      the Old British Commonwealth. Foreign editions are also available in\u000a      France, Italy, USA, Germany, The Czech Republic, and Poland[1].\u000a      The range of reviews the book has received on public forums such as amazon.co.uk\u000a      demonstrates the effect it has had on readers' understanding of the themes\u000a      involved. In 2009, Tallscotin stated that \"[t]hose who have a fragmentary\u000a      knowledge of either Roman or Jewish history will find his book makes\u000a      helpful connections. The scope of the study is impressive as is the\u000a      authority with which it is written. It is also very accessible in its\u000a      writing style\". In 2012, Matthew Hosier wrote, \"[t]he fact that the Temple\u000a      was never rebuilt is a greater anomaly than I had previously understood.\u000a      ...The main theme through this book is to unpick why Roman hostility\u000a      towards Jerusalem was so disproportionate. ...[The book is] very helpful\u000a      in gaining a deeper understanding of the social, political and religious\u000a      background to the birth of Christianity, and the development of Western\u000a      civilisation\". Jeremy Bevan also commented, \"there's no doubt this is a\u000a      major contribution to how we understand the dynamics of an encounter than\u000a      changed history decisively, and I have no hesitation in recommending it\"[i].\u000a    Professor Goodman has further propagated his research findings to a wide\u000a      audience, from schoolchildren to much older members of the public, through\u000a      an impressive series of public talks and lectures. In Oxford, he convenes\u000a      weekly public lectures during term times on general topics within Jewish\u000a      Studies during term times on Wednesday evenings at the Centre for Hebrew\u000a      and Jewish Studies in Yarnton Manor. These lectures generally attract an\u000a      audience of between 30 and 60 people. He also organizes similar public\u000a      lectures in London on behalf of the Centre. These lectures are held in\u000a      either the London Jewish Cultural Centre or the Jewish Museum, and\u000a      generally attract audiences of approximately 100 people. He is chairman of\u000a      the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society, which exists to bring to the\u000a      attention of the public in England the importance of archaeological\u000a      research in Israel and its environs, both through lectures (in the British\u000a      Museum, UCL or KCL) and through publication of Strata, the\u000a      Society's journal.\u000a    Since 2008, he has twice spoken at the Godolphin and Latymer School\u000a      Classics Breakfast Club in London, to an audience of about 70 each time.\u000a      His most recent visit was in October 2012; afterwards, one audience member\u000a      was compelled to write, \"Thank for a fascinating talk on Friday morning.\u000a      It has really stimulated my interest in this area and I look forward to\u000a      reading your Rome and Jerusalem and The Roman World, both\u000a      of which I have just ordered\"[2].\u000a    It is probable, however, that the research has had its greatest impact on\u000a      English Jewish readers, since most requests to give talks come from Jewish\u000a      groups. The organizers of these talks are often explicit that they have\u000a      been encouraged to send an invitation either by having read Rome and\u000a        Jerusalem or by having heard a lecture by Professor Goodman at\u000a      Limmud, a British-Jewish educational charity. Lectures for Limmud\u000a      generally attract an audience of 100 or more, and Goodman spoke for the\u000a      charity on `Ancient Limmud: toleration of variety within Judaism in Second\u000a      Temple times' in Leeds and Warwick in 2009[ii].\u000a    Other talks delivered by Goodman include: the Michael Weitzman Memorial\u000a      Lecture in 2008; `Varieties of Judaism in the Ancient World' to Stanmore\u000a      and Canons Park Synagogue, Middlesex[iii]; `Writing a\u000a      history of Judaism', to around 30 people at the Jewish Historical Society\u000a      in July 2012; and `The destruction of the Temple: the ancient origins of\u000a      antisemtis', to an audience of approximately 25 people at DAVAR (a Jewish\u000a      cultural group in Bristol) in December 2012.\u000a    In 2006, Goodman acted as historical advisor for episode 3 of the BBC\u000a      drama Ancient Rome: the Rise and Fall of an Empire. At the time\u000a      this programme was watched by 3.3 million viewers[iv],\u000a      and since 2008 438 copies of the DVD have been sold in the UK[3].\u000a      He also participated in episode 3 of the 2013 BBC documentary Mothers,\u000a        Murderers and Mistresses: Empresses of Ancient Rome, discussing the\u000a      life of Berenice.

Some prime\u000a      examples were evidenced following a series of public and university\u000a      lectures in and around Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in April 2013.\u000a      Professor James McLaren, Associate Dean (Research) at the Australian\u000a      Catholic University stated that Goodman's publications \"are set as\u000a      readings for specific topics and as part of the general bibliography. His\u000a      research has also informed and help[ed] shape the way subject matter is\u000a      presented in lectures\"[4]. In reference to a taught unit\u000a      on the Dead Sea Scrolls at the University of Sydney, for which Professor\u000a      Goodman's publications are also included on the reading list, Associate\u000a      Professor Ian Young attested that \"Martin's theories play a significant\u000a      role in my approach to this course\". Professor Suzanne Rutland, also of\u000a      the University of Sydney, added that \"Professor Goodman's deep scholarship\u000a      of the Second Temple Period and Roman world has been impressive and\u000a      inspiring to staff and students alike. He gave two lectures to my Jewish\u000a      Civilisation class in the course `Palestine: Rome to Islam'... He helped\u000a      to provide the students with a deeper understanding of these developments,\u000a      and also challenged some of the more orthodox interpretations of the\u000a      situation in Judea in first century CE... I know that my students gained a\u000a      lot from his approach and I shall be incorporating the material from his\u000a      handouts into my lectures in the future\"[5].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    There has been a continuing demand for public lectures to audiences of\u000a      all ages demonstrating an appetite for understanding the early\u000a      marginalisation of Jews: Martin Goodman's research on the place of Jews\u000a      and Judaism in the Roman world from the first century BCE to the fourth\u000a      century CE has expanded public awareness of the treatment of minorities in\u000a      imperial systems, the origins of anti-Semitism, the early development of\u000a      Rabbinic Judaism, and the relationship between Christianity and Judaism in\u000a      antiquity (which has implications for interfaith relationships in the\u000a      present day).

Combining his expertise in Jewish and\u000a      in Roman history, and taking advantage of the rich research environment in\u000a      Oxford for Classics and Religious Studies as well as Hebrew and Jewish\u000a      Studies, he has sought to use the extensive evidence for Jews and Judaism\u000a      in the Roman empire as a means to increase understanding of the variegated\u000a      nature of ancient Judaism, the place of Jews and Judaism as a minority\u000a      people and religion within a complex imperial system, and the value of the\u000a      Jewish evidence for the interpretation more generally of the treatment of\u000a      ethnic and religious minorities in the Roman world.\u000a    The research has directly tackled the challenges posed by the selective\u000a      preservation of evidence about Jews and Judaism in this period by the two\u000a      religious systems, rabbinic Judaism and Christianity, which emerged from\u000a      the world of first-century Jews, and the need to avoid imposing on the\u000a      evidence assumptions derived from these later traditions.\u000a    Mission and Conversion (1994) challenged the presumption (standard\u000a      up to then) that Jewish missionary activity laid the foundations of early\u000a      Christian mission, finding the evidence for such missionary activity to be\u000a      lacking. In so far as Jewish and Christian traditions were related in this\u000a      area, it was through Christian influence on the assumptions of later\u000a      rabbinic Jews. By contrast, a project on apologetics in the Roman empire\u000a      demonstrated that a highly rhetorical defensive composition by the\u000a      first-century Jewish author Flavius Josephus, his Contra Apionem, was an\u000a      early example of what was to become a very popular Christian literary\u000a      genre in the second century.\u000a    Another series of studies investigated the extent to which Jews, as just\u000a      one people among many minorities in the multicultural society ruled by\u000a      Rome, were really as different from other peoples as was sometimes claimed\u000a      in antiquity in the light of the violent uprisings of Jews against Rome in\u000a      66- 70, 115-117 and 132-135 CE. Investigation of other groups and\u000a      religions in the Roman world showed that preservation of national\u000a      characteristics was by no means unique to Jews, and that the impression of\u000a      their special nature was largely the result of the preservation of so much\u000a      more material by and about them than about other provincial peoples and\u000a      religious cults.\u000a    These studies culminated in a work of synthetic research, Rome and\u000a        Jerusalem (2007), which showed that the war between Rome and the\u000a      Jews in Judaea in 66-70 CE, which ended in the destruction of the\u000a      Jerusalem Temple and the marginalisation of the Jews in the Roman world,\u000a      was the product not of an intrinsic culture clash but a series of\u000a      miscalculations by individual Jews and Romans and the political\u000a      imperatives of the new Flavian imperial dynasty whose public justification\u000a      for seizing power in Rome in 69 CE was the defeat of the Jews and the\u000a      destruction of Jerusalem.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8847","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Griffith Institute (GI) has a major role propagating information\u000d\u000a      about ancient Egypt in society, directly through its website, Facebook,\u000d\u000a      and Twitter presence, as well as through the facilities it makes available\u000d\u000a      to content-providers in many sectors and diverse social groups, including\u000d\u000a      audiences in contemporary Egypt. The many databases it maintains online,\u000d\u000a      such as Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation, form primary points\u000d\u000a      of access and interest for non-academic organisations and the general\u000d\u000a      public. With ancient Egypt holding a major position in popular culture in\u000d\u000a      the West and, increasingly, in the Middle East and Asia, much public\u000d\u000a      interest in Tutankhamun is fed by fanciful material available in print and\u000d\u000a      television media and elsewhere on the internet. By contrast, the Institute\u000d\u000a      provides accurate, accessible, and authoritative information about all\u000d\u000a      aspects of ancient Egypt through online and print media, as well as making\u000d\u000a      resources accessible in visual forms including film, television, and\u000d\u000a      exhibitions.

Highly positive feedback from users is frequently received; for\u000d\u000a      example, in 2009 a grandmother wrote to the Institute regarding her\u000d\u000a      grandson's project on Tutankhamun: `I want to thank you again. My grandson\u000d\u000a      put a copy of the e-mails that we sent and your response in the scrapbook.\u000d\u000a      His booklet was the best of the class... His teacher wants to keep it for\u000d\u000a      an example in future classes.' Permission is regularly granted to teachers\u000d\u000a      to use material, such as the famous Harry Burton photographs of the tomb\u000d\u000a      of Tutankhamun. In early 2011, a UK primary school-teacher requested\u000d\u000a      Burton photographs for class teaching, and after the GI staff suggested\u000d\u000a      some additional material, the following response was received [1]:\u000d\u000a      `They have been totally spell bound by this topic and beg me every day for\u000d\u000a      more lessons on Tutankhamun...

The collections expand continually and are used actively and\u000d\u000a      internationally for scholarship. The development and publication of this\u000d\u000a      renowned, comprehensive textual and visual archive for ancient and modern\u000d\u000a      Egypt is sustained through the Institute's primary research projects. The\u000d\u000a      Topographical Bibliography (TB) brings together published and archival\u000d\u000a      material for analysis and synthesis by the editor. It was founded in the\u000d\u000a      1890s and is now moving into online provision under Vincent Razanajao\u000d\u000a      (since August 2012). The five most recent volumes are by Jaromir Malek (in\u000d\u000a      post 1971-2011), assisted by Elizabeth Fleming n&#233;e Miles (1983-present),\u000d\u000a      Diana Magee (1981-2010), and Alison Hobby (1999-2012); these appeared in\u000d\u000a      1999 (8.1-2, in three volumes), 2007 (8.3), and 2012 (8.4).\u000d\u000a    As a research conspectus, the TB provides a fundamental, universally\u000d\u000a      recognised point of departure for research on Egyptian artefacts and\u000d\u000a      sites, many of which await full publication. It offers comprehensive\u000d\u000a      published and unpublished information about inscribed monuments and\u000d\u000a      artefacts, including architecture, iconography, texts, attributions, and\u000d\u000a      datings in addition to the bibliographical data. For some sites, much of\u000d\u000a      the ancient setting can only be modelled through sources in archives and\u000d\u000a      in publications of the eighteenth to early twentieth centuries that\u000d\u000a      recorded places before the enormous changes of the last 150 years. The TB\u000d\u000a      gathers, orders, analyses, and presents such material, and the staff\u000d\u000a      ensure that the Archive holdings are intensively researched before being\u000d\u000a      made available. Research for the TB consolidates all relevant information\u000d\u000a      about sites and monuments into forms that can be displayed online and\u000d\u000a      searched, and incorporates archival materials, alongside museum records\u000d\u000a      and print publications, into the network of resources held by the\u000d\u000a      Institute.\u000d\u000a    Specialized and extremely valuable records that are maintained in the\u000d\u000a      Institute's Archive include, for example, catalogues of the images within\u000d\u000a      18th and 19th century manuscripts including watercolours and commercially\u000d\u000a      distributed photographs, with identifications of what they represent and\u000d\u000a      where other records of the same places and objects can be found. The range\u000d\u000a      of material that the Institute presents online increases constantly, while\u000d\u000a      conservation work in the Archive (in collaboration with the Ashmolean\u000d\u000a      Museum and Bodleian Library) safeguards fragile records for the future.\u000d\u000a      Where practicable, material in the Archive is recorded in archive-quality\u000d\u000a      scans and placed online for easy access.\u000d\u000a    The open-access website makes significant parts of the Institute's\u000d\u000a      resources and research directly accessible (http:\/\/www.griffith.ox.ac.uk).\u000a      The site offers databases that provide carefully structured, searchable\u000d\u000a      access to the Archive. The databases derive from the years of research,\u000d\u000a      analysis, and identification by the whole TB team, often in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with scholars around the world. For example, the open-access database Tutankhamun:\u000a        Anatomy of an Excavation, developed under Jaromir Malek and placed\u000d\u000a      online in 2001, is designed for use by both scholars and non-specialists,\u000d\u000a      and presents and explains the full archaeological record for the richest\u000d\u000a      complete tomb ever discovered in Egypt.\u000d\u000a    A second major project, the Online Egyptological Bibliography (OEB, http:\/\/oeb.griffith.\u000a        ox.ac.uk), a subscriber service, provides the broadest window onto\u000d\u000a      publications in Egyptology. It was acquired in January 2009 both for its\u000d\u000a      great intrinsic value and to complement and provide an automated reference\u000d\u000a      base for the more site-focused TB and Archive. OEB, which is developing\u000d\u000a      rapidly, offers over 107,000 records with abstracts and keywords, adding\u000d\u000a      more than 2500 new publications annually. OEB, which incorporates the\u000d\u000a      Munich website Aigyptos, is an international project, led by the\u000d\u000a      grant-holder Oxford University, with important partners in Germany, Italy,\u000d\u000a      Japan, and the USA.

(Erik\u000a      Goldner, California State University, Northridge); `the book helps grad\u000a      students and upper level history majors tackle questions of historiography\u000a      in their long writing assignment... thanks for this powerful contribution\u000a      to the field.' (John Savage, Lehigh University, Pennsylvania); `your book\u000a      is and will be on the doctoral exam book list of every student I have who\u000a      does any reading on the French Revolution.' (Richard S. Fogarty,\u000a      University at Albany, SUNY) (CS1).\u000a    Given that the field of French Revolution studies is a highly congested\u000a      one, with new high-level surveys and analytical syntheses appearing every\u000a      year, these results, seven years after initial publication, are testimony\u000a      to the lasting and significant impact of Andress's work on the\u000a      teaching-practices of university teachers and the understanding of their\u000a      students across the Anglophone world.\u000a    This research has also had impact on UK A-level teaching. For the past\u000a      five years Andress has lectured regularly on the themes of his work to\u000a      sixth-form students (a cumulative audience of several thousands) at events\u000a      organised by Premier Student Conferences and Sovereign Education, the most\u000a      significant bodies offering direct experience of academic history to UK\u000a      school students. The Director of Premier Student Conferences has noted\u000a      that Andress receives `much praise from teachers' in feedback on these\u000a      events, with the clarity and quality of Andress's interpretations\u000a      consistently acknowledged, along with their positive impact on student\u000a      understanding (CS2).\u000a    In 2010, the exam board EdExcel chose an excerpt from The Terror\u000a      as one of only three historiographical extracts for commentary on their A2\u000a      History paper on the Revolution. Building on this significant impact, in\u000a      2011\/12 Andress was commissioned by the Society for the Study of French\u000a      History to produce a revision-guide and series of audio podcasts for free\u000a      distribution to A-level students nationwide (CS3). The launch of this\u000a      resource was accompanied with a further contribution to the Historical\u000a      Association magazine Teaching History. Both the written and audio\u000a      materials encapsulate the key findings of the underpinning research and\u000a      make it accessible to new educational audiences. This work has been\u000a      accessed by students and teachers not merely in the UK, but as far afield\u000a      as Islamabad, Pakistan. Recent feedback on the podcasts from teachers\u000a      includes: `I have found them very helpful, not only for myself but for my\u000a      exceptionally bright group of Year 13 students'; `your podcast has proved\u000a      especially useful ... along with the accompanying essay, very helpful\u000a      particularly for revision' (CS4).\u000a    Through this work, and its basis in his research, Andress has a\u000a      significant claim to have a leading active impact on the educational\u000a      understanding of the French Revolution, structuring syllabi and\u000a      influencing both the construction of examinations and the pedagogical\u000a      response to them, with a reach extending from UK school students and\u000a      teachers to postgraduate students across the Anglophone world.\u000a    Cultural Impact\u000a    The Terror has had global sales of some 17,000 copies (CS5). One\u000a      indicator of direct impact on individuals is their engagement through\u000a      ratings on the goodreads.com website, where the US edition of the work has\u000a      an average score of 4.01 out of 5. It continues to attract individual 4-\u000a      and 5-star ratings in 2013. This compares, for example, to a rating of\u000a      3.97 for Schama's Citizens, and 3.71 for Doyle's Oxford\u000a        History of the French Revolution, and is the highest rating of any\u000a      recently-published history text on the Revolution (figures here and below\u000a      accurate as of 10 October 2013). Comments include `This is History at its\u000a      best', `an author who understands the relevance of their lessons for\u000a      today's world', `Fascinating and very informative... It will make you\u000a      hunger for more' (CS6).\u000a    The impact of this research on other non-academic bodies is demonstrated\u000a      by a series of engagements explicitly arising from the public profile of The\u000a        Terror. Oxford Analytica, a consulting company, commissioned Andress\u000a      to write a guide to the French Revolution for a major client, and the Wall\u000a        Street Journal commissioned a blog piece on the contemporary\u000a      resonance of French revolutionary experiences (CS7). Orion Publishers\u000a      invited him to act as historical consultant on Sally Gardner's children's\u000a      fiction books set in the Revolution, The Red Necklace and The\u000a        Silver Blade. As the author noted, Andress's contribution `was\u000a      significant, contributing to my ability to set a stimulating story in a\u000a      realistic historical context, and assisting through this additional\u000a      dimension of the work with the achievement of the very positive critical\u000a      and reader response that it received' (CS8). In a review, the leading\u000a      magazine Publisher's Weekly specifically noted that The Red\u000a        Necklace `paints vivid, convincing pictures of the Revolution'\u000a      (CS9), and the book is rated at 3.81 out of 5 by a large sample of readers\u000a      on goodreads.com. The Silver\u000a        Blade is at 3.93.\u000a    The conclusions of The Terror were further articulated in a TV\u000a      drama-documentary, `Terror! Robespierre and the French Revolution',\u000a      produced in 2008\/09. The programme was broadcast on 11 July 2009 on BBC2,\u000a      and repeated on BBC4 on 24 October 2009. Well-received on first broadcast,\u000a      the programme is currently rated at 7.8 out of 10 on the Internet Movie\u000a      Database, a global monitor of broadcast output. As well as providing\u000a      initial background information and perspective, Andress was interviewed\u000a      extensively for the programme itself, and appeared as one of the major\u000a      on-screen contributors. This programme, thanks to the input of Andress and\u000a      his work, was able to counterpoint a continued left-right oppositional\u000a      engagement with more subtle debate about the contexts of revolutionary\u000a      actors and the constraints on their behaviour (CS10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Through a range of publications and public engagements, the research of\u000a      Professor David Andress into the French Revolution and its international\u000a      and historical ramifications has achieved a notable impact on students and\u000a      teachers in the educational sphere, becoming an influential interpretation\u000a      in syllabi at undergraduate and postgraduate levels across the\u000a      English-speaking world, as well as for A-level studies within the UK.

He has developed through his research an interpretation of the\u000a      Revolution which complicates and challenges earlier historiographies at\u000a      several levels, redefining an engagement with lived experience and the\u000a      complexities of shifting understandings and allegiances that marked the\u000a      period. While continuing to develop publications based on archival primary\u000a      research (Outputs 1-3, see Section 3), he has incorporated such research\u000a      into wider analyses through a series of books.\u000a    His 2000 monograph, Massacre at the Champ de Mars (Output 4), was\u000a      reviewed as a `compelling' argument in the Journal of Social History\u000a      (Supporting evidence 1), as a `nuanced, multi-layered analysis ... to be\u000a      entirely welcomed' in the Journal of Modern History (Supporting\u000a      evidence 2), and as `an important departure' for revolutionary\u000a      historiography, `undoubtedly right' in its methodology and thus\u000a      `especially informative' in the Historical Journal (Supporting\u000a      evidence 3). His 2004 text, The French Revolution and the People\u000a      (Output 5), was reviewed by the International Review of Social History\u000a      (Supporting evidence 4) as `a truly excellent book', offering `insights to\u000a      specialists and a rich and clear account to general readers'. The European\u000a        History Quarterly (Supporting evidence 5) noted it was `a crisply\u000a      written, remarkably well-researched and informative synthesis... a\u000a      coherent, passionate and thought-provoking reinterpretation ... an\u000a      excellent book, engaging, combative and well-written'.\u000a    This body of work culminated in his most widely-read work, The Terror,\u000a      published in the UK in 2005 and in a US edition in 2006 (Output 6). The\u000a      impact achieved by this book, as representing the underlying body of\u000a      research, is the subject of this case-study. Widely and positively\u000a      reviewed in the UK quality press, it also received academic praise.\u000a      Reviewed by the Annales historiques de la R&#233;volution fran&#231;aise\u000a      (Supporting evidence 6) as `This laudable effort ... an excellent\u000a      summation', Prof David Bell (Princeton) noted in the New Republic\u000a      (Supporting evidence 7) that it was `a remarkably good job... a sure guide\u000a      through some of the most compressed and tangled political undergrowth in\u000a      history', and Prof William Doyle (Bristol) in the Independent\u000a      (Supporting evidence 8) called it `The most authoritative treatment we are\u000a      likely to have for many years.'\u000a    The core argument of The Terror is encapsulated in its sub-title:\u000a      civil war in the French Revolution. Andress argues that the major\u000a      historiographical currents of the late twentieth century, the\u000a      Jacobin-Marxist `social interpretation' and the `revisionists' such as\u000a      Furet and Schama who place great emphasis on the power of abstract\u000a      political rhetoric, are both essentially limited when attempting to engage\u000a      the complexity of revolutionary processes.\u000a    Andress's research findings demonstrate the need for an understanding of\u000a      the deep cultures of the eighteenth century when explaining the French\u000a      Revolution. Groups such as Parisian radicals and `counter-revolutionary'\u000a      peasants, previously painted as heroes or villains of competing accounts,\u000a      can now be seen as having complex perspectives of their own, meriting\u000a      reconsideration. Andress also demonstrates that amongst the elites\u000a      themselves the apparently delirious rhetoric of revolutionary enthusiasm\u000a      was in fact firmly grounded in the culture of the period, and represented\u000a      both the necessary and the virtuous way to conduct public affairs amidst\u000a      epochal change.\u000a    In works both of original research and original synthesis, Andress has\u000a      used insights such as these to restore agency to the many different groups\u000a      involved in revolutionary events, presenting new explanations for extreme\u000a      behaviour and conflict that restore the thought-provoking commonality\u000a      between reader and subject, rather than, as so many past versions of the\u000a      French Revolution have done, creating a playing-field for cheering on one\u000a      side against the other, in the name of present politics.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12911","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aa) On Caste and Untouchability\u000d\u000ai) Support for lobbying\u000d\u000aThe most significant impact of Dhanda's research lies in its contribution to the recent\u000d\u000aamendment to the Equality Act 2010 enacted by Section 97 of the Enterprise and Regulatory\u000d\u000aReform Act 2013. This amendment requires the government to draw up secondary legislation for\u000d\u000athe inclusion of `caste' as an aspect of `race'. The vote in parliament in favour of such inclusion was\u000d\u000apreceded by intensive lobbying by groups such as CasteWatch UK. Dhanda shared her research\u000d\u000afindings with Lord Avebury and Lord Harries before the Lords debate on 04\/03\/2013 and, more\u000d\u000asignificantly, before the second reading of the Bill on 16\/04\/2013, Dhanda was approached by a\u000d\u000aresearcher for Peers in the House of Lords, Dorothy Hughes, for advice (see 5a). Dhanda's\u000d\u000acontribution to the campaign has been praised by Davinder Prasad, the general secretary of\u000d\u000aCasteWatch UK thus: `Dr Dhanda has been one of the most committed activist[s] in our cause. Her\u000d\u000aresearch on the subject of caste in [the] UK and her contribution to so many discussions &amp;\u000d\u000adebates including a conference organised by Sikhs in Birmingham a few years ago was so\u000d\u000avaluable for our campaign in the early days. [...] Her contribution to [the] Brit Asia TV debate on\u000d\u000aApache Indian show would be remembered and not many Asian academics have the courage to\u000d\u000aspeak out against caste so openly. [...] If ever any help is required from a Brit Asian academic, Dr\u000d\u000aDhanda would be the one who can be relied upon' (See section 5e).

Kathleen Lennon and Margaret Whitford, [London: Routledge, 1994]).

Her work on caste identity highlighted the\u000d\u000apaucity of primary research on the subject, leading her to undertake pilot studies in Wolverhampton\u000d\u000aand Punjab funded by the University of Wolverhampton Early Research Award Scheme in 2007-\u000d\u000a2008, resulting in several presentations in national and international conferences and a journal\u000d\u000aarticle (Reference 2).\u000d\u000aThe Leverhulme Research Fellowship Caste Aside: Dalit Punjabi Identity and Experience\u000d\u000a(Reference 6) was carried out over a period of 22 months (09\/2010-07\/2012) and involved\u000d\u000aextensive fieldwork in the form of ethnography and surveys. It focussed on capturing Dalit\u000d\u000aexperience both in urban Punjab and in the cities with a high concentration of Dalits in the UK,\u000d\u000ausing original mixed methodologies. Dhanda presented eleven conference papers and delivered\u000d\u000aten invited guest lectures on Dalit experience at national and international conferences and\u000d\u000apublished References 4 and 5, as well as `Certain Allegiances, Uncertain Identities: The Fraught\u000d\u000aStruggles of Dalits in Britain' (in The New Indian Diaspora, ed.

Its impact has been pan-European in reach. Its significance lies in\u000a      its close collaboration with prospective users and its impact on three\u000a      types of beneficiaries: museum organizations, museum professionals, and\u000a      policy-makers in the museum &amp; cultural field.\u000a    Museum organizations:\u000a    At the institutional level the project team established close working\u000a      relations with museum organisations. Exhibiting Europe became one\u000a      of only eight partner projects of the Europe-wide Network of European\u000a      Museum Organisations (NEMO). The project team presented its preliminary\u000a      and final project results at the annual NEMO conferences in Linz (2009),\u000a      Copenhagen (2010) and Athens (2011), via the NEMO newsletter and at the\u000a      International Council of Museums (ICOM) world conferences in Shanghai\u000a      (2010) and Cape Town (2012). Kaiser focussed especially on advising these\u000a      museum organizations on how to improve their cooperation and lobbying\u000a      despite limited resources. As the NEMO project manager has stated (CS1),\u000a      you `have helped our organization greatly to enhance its effectiveness.\u000a      ... We now seek to work more closely with resource-rich national\u000a      institutions and to harness the intercultural competence of individual\u000a      museum entrepreneurs better for strengthening our impact on national and\u000a      European policy-making ....'\u000a    Museum professionals:\u000a    The project team's direct contacts with museum professionals created a\u000a      durable academic-practitioner network in addition to generating evidence\u000a      for the project. Several practitioners were involved in the project\u000a      workshops in Trondheim (2008), Wroclaw (2009), Manchester and Amsterdam\u000a      (2010) including the director of the exhibition company Tempora and the\u000a      director of the City Museum Luxembourg. In addition, 20 practitioners\u000a      attended the final conference in Oslo (2011) with mixed\u000a      academic-practitioner panels including the director of the House of\u000a      European History.\u000a    Kaiser also established close links with the ESF-funded Inventing\u000a        Europe programme and has made a major contribution to the novel\u000a      systematic cooperation of a team of 13 historians with major European\u000a      science and technology museums including the British Science Museum.\u000a      Together they have developed an interactive web-site (http:\/\/www.inventingeurope.eu\/)\u000a      hosted by the Foundation for the History of Technology which first went\u000a      online in September 2012 (11.000 hits by 31 July 2013 &#8212; CS6). The web-site\u000a      combines objects from the museums with stories and story pathways written\u000a      by historians, making them accessible for HEI and school teachers\/students\u000a      and others with an interest in the history of technology. The Keeper of\u000a      Science and Medicine at the British Science Museum has confirmed (CS2)\u000a      that this `is just the way we can make most accessible and widely\u000a      interesting our intellectual and physical resources'. According to the\u000a      Research Director at the Deutsches Museum (CS3), this new internet\u000a      facility `greatly enhances our opportunities as museums for engaging in an\u000a      interactive way with users online, also enticing them to visit our own\u000a      websites and actual material exhibitions.' Moreover, as the President of\u000a      the Board of the Foundation for the History of Technology has emphasized\u000a      (CS4), `... the new website engages youngsters in particular, and nurtures\u000a      their interest in current as well as past technological innovations. This\u000a      will also increase the likelihood that they will study or work in a\u000a      related field which is so important for European businesses.'\u000a    Kaiser has also provided advice, based upon his research, to museum\u000a      professionals on how to enhance their reflexive knowledge of their own\u000a      transnational practices and to develop more convincing transnational\u000a      narratives for their museums. He has published several pieces in\u000a      internet-based European cultural magazines (e.g. http:\/\/www.eurozine.com\/articles\/2011-11-24-kaiser-en.html)\u000a      which are widely read by curators. Moreover, he has worked closely with\u000a      the project team of the House of European History, a museum of Europe and\u000a      European integration history due to open in Brussels in 2015. The director\u000a      and several members of the project team have frequently consulted him to\u000a      ensure that their narratives reflect the `transnational turn' and the\u000a      state of the art of research on the history of European integration. For\u000a      example, the curator, who leads the development of the permanent\u000a      exhibition for the period from 1945 to the early 1980s, has stated `that I\u000a      find many stories in your publications about transnational societal actors\u000a      fascinating. Some of them will be invaluable for linking the political\u000a      history and the social history of integration far more organically in our\u000a      exhibition. As a result I am sure that our visitors will understand much\u000a      better the connections between their everyday life experiences and memory\u000a      and what happened in \"Brussels\".' (CS5)\u000a    Policy-makers in the museum &amp; cultural field:\u000a    More recently, finally, Kaiser's publications for a broader public\u000a      together with his collaboration with museum organisations and museum\u000a      professionals have led to his inclusion in a new high level policy\u000a      dialogue about `narratives for Europe'. This was initiated by the European\u000a      Parliament and is run by the cultural centre Bozar in Brussels and the\u000a      European Commission. Together with c. 50 other artists, intellectuals and\u000a      academics Kaiser was invited to an inaugural debate in Brussels on 23\u000a      April 2013 with Commission President Barroso and commissioners Vassiliou\u000a      and Reding. On 11 July Kaiser then participated in the first `general\u000a      assembly on forms of imagination and thinking for Europe' in Warsaw, with\u000a      Barroso and the Polish Prime Minister Tusk. This will be followed by a\u000a      working dinner and reflection half-day with Barroso and the Italian Prime\u000a      Minister Letta in Milan on 8-9 December 2013. The EP and the Commission\u000a      expect that this high-level policy dialogue will generate new ways of\u000a      `narrating' Europe and European integration which should make it easier\u000a      for EU citizens to connect with the EU, its institutions and policies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Exhibiting Europe project has generated change in the museum\u000a      world with a pan-European reach.

Based on\u000a      research in 25 archives in nine countries, his book Christian\u000a        Democracy and the Origins of European Union (PVI) traced the\u000a      cross-border cooperation among Catholic\/Christian democratic parties and\u000a      politicians since the late nineteenth century, demonstrating how their\u000a      informal coordination strongly influenced key political decisions such as\u000a      the creation of a `core Europe' without Britain in the 1950s, with lasting\u000a      impact until today.\u000a    The book defined a new research agenda, which Kaiser pursued further in\u000a      several collaborative projects and publications (see e.g. PI &amp; V).\u000a      These publications have made a convincing case for a new understanding of\u000a      the history of European integration as more than the bargaining of\u000a      `national interests' among governments. Instead they show how societal\u000a      actors like political parties, business organizations and civil society\u000a      groups have impacted on building the present-day EU and contributed to\u000a      developing new common policies such as environmental protection. Kaiser\u000a      has also co-edited and contributed to the only systematic summary of the\u000a      state of the art in European integration history research, European\u000a        Union History (PV) which is now widely used for advanced UG and PG\u000a      teaching on Europe and the EU.\u000a    This work on transnational European integration has been highly\u000a      interdisciplinary in integrating social science perspectives with\u000a      historical research. Beginning in 2008 and building on his strong\u000a      reputation in the field of transnational European history, Kaiser has\u000a      developed a new line of such interdisciplinary research in the\u000a      collaborative research project Exhibiting Europe. Working with\u000a      Stefan Krankenhagen (cultural studies, Trondheim\/Norway, now\u000a      Hildesheim\/Germany) and Kerstin Poehls (social anthropology, HU Berlin,\u000a      now Hamburg\/Germany) he has examined if, how and in what ways historical\u000a      museums and exhibitions across Europe are becoming more European or\u000a      transnational in response to new challenges such as globalization and city\u000a      tourism. Based on the analysis of nearly 100 history museums and\u000a      exhibitions and interviews with 64 cultural policy-makers and museum\u000a      directors and curators throughout Europe, this research has led to the\u000a      co-authored book Europa ausstellen (PII) and several\u000a      single-authored publications by Kaiser in journals and books (e.g. PIII\u000a      &amp; IV). He has argued in particular that the museum sector is becoming\u000a      more and more Europeanized in its organisation, structures and\u000a      network-type cooperation. At the same time, the museums' changing\u000a      narratives, or `stories' are experiencing a `transnational turn' which\u000a      emphasizes connections across borders in trade, migration etc. However,\u000a      these growing connections normally are not linked in the museums and\u000a      exhibitions to the political history of the EU. Moreover, due to time\u000a      constraints and other pressures these changes in representations are\u000a      hardly reflected by museum professionals.\u000a    His deep insights in transnational European history and how this history\u000a      is told in museums has placed Kaiser in a unique position to advise\u000a      museums and new museum projects like the House of European History in\u000a      Brussels, as well as European policy-makers.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15883","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The significance of the Portsmouth Voices project was that it presented a\u000a      challenging narrative of\u000a      Portsmouth's history, successfully engaging people in the region beyond an\u000a      established core\u000a      constituency of museum-goers. Moreover, Beaven's research and leading role\u000a      in the formation of\u000a      the project pushed its boundaries beyond traditional museum content and\u000a      encouraged the\u000a      Portsmouth City Museum (PCM) to re-evaluate its approach to future\u000a      exhibitions (CS3 &#8212;\u000a      references to Section 5).\u000a    Beaven played a key role, in collaboration with the Museum, in\u000a      formulating the concept, design and\u000a      thematic content of the project proposal for Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF)\u000a      support. On its successful\u000a      outcome, Beaven, with project partners PCM and Portsmouth Historic\u000a      Dockyard Trust, was\u000a      charged with managing a budget of &#163;223,500 for a series of activities\u000a      leading up to a key exhibition\u000a      in 2009-10. The project engaged the Portsmouth and Hampshire public\u000a      through displays,\u000a      publications and educational packs on the history of Portsmouth's popular\u000a      culture from the late\u000a      nineteenth century to the present day. Part of the source-material for the\u000a      exhibitions and\u000a      publications was formed from a major collection of over three hundred new\u000a      oral histories generated\u000a      by the project (CS1).\u000a    Beaven's research framed the core themes that directed the oral history\u000a      interviews and the topics\u000a      covered in exhibitions and publications. PCM remarked that Beaven's\u000a      `research and consultation\u000a      was vital as it pulled the project in a more fruitful and challenging\u000a      direction and beyond the\u000a      parochial', adding that he took the Museum out of the `Local Authority\u000a      silo' (CS2). The issues of\u000a      class, gender, ethnicity and generation ran through the major concluding\u000a      exhibition entitled `The\u000a      Game of Life: Exploring Family Life in Portsmouth'. The perspectives\u000a      generated through Beaven's\u000a      research on citizenship and the city underpinned the exhibition's approach\u000a      to its core ambition: to\u000a      present an inclusive history of Portsmouth in the twentieth century,\u000a      ranging from the socially\u000a      disadvantaged to the privileged, and across a sweep of social and ethnic\u000a      groups not previously\u000a      represented in the Museum. The project thus included consultation and\u000a      interviews with Polish,\u000a      Russian and Kurdish migrants, and engagement with Portsmouth's Lesbian,\u000a      Gay, Bisexual and\u000a      Transgender community.\u000a    The exhibition proved popular with the public, attracting over 31,000\u000a      visitors between July 2009\u000a      and January 2010 (CS2). Taking its intellectual lead from Beaven's work,\u000a      `The Game of Life'\u000a      explored how the moral assumptions that underpinned key life stages\u000a      (infancy, childhood,\u000a      adolescence, courtship, marriage, parenthood, old age and death) changed\u000a      between the 1920s\u000a      and the present day. Moreover, the exhibition's engagement with difficult\u000a      and challenging issues\u000a      such as racism and sexuality stimulated public debate and inspired Dr Jane\u000a      Mee, Manager of\u000a      Portsmouth Museums and Galleries, to write an article for a key\u000a      international practitioners'\u000a      publication, the Museums Journal. She noted that despite early\u000a      concerns about the exhibition's\u000a      engagement with sensitive issues she was pleased that `the project team\u000a      had the confidence to run\u000a      with the material' and that the real lesson that the Museum had learned\u000a      for the future was to `trust\u000a      the public and be less afraid of taking risks' (CS3).\u000a    Equally challenging issues were explored in an oral history campaign on\u000a      `Food', which invited the\u000a      public to reflect upon differing food traditions and cultures, the\u000a      industrial production of food, and\u000a      eating disorders. This extended its reach beyond the Museum through the\u000a      development of\u000a      educational packs and oral history training. Thus, as PCM have noted,\u000a      teachers at Mayfield\u000a      Secondary School in Portsmouth employed the project's core themes as the\u000a      basis for pupil\u000a      discussion on eating disorders. Pupils also learned oral history\u000a      techniques and created textile\u000a      based art on the theme of food that was included in the exhibition (CS2).\u000a    An important aim of the project was to involve the local community in the\u000a      generation of oral\u000a      histories. In designing the content of this activity, Beaven used his\u000a      research as a basis to frame the\u000a      interview questions on subjects such as teenage experiences, courtship,\u000a      masculinity and inter-generational conflict. Beaven and PCM established community events to\u000a      recruit and train local\u000a      people in the techniques of oral history. This work resulted in 433\u000a      person-days of input by\u000a      Portsmouth volunteers (CS1), reflecting the enthusiasm generated around\u000a      the project, which\u000a      eventually collected 314 individual histories. In addition, a `Video Van'\u000a      visited community events\u000a      and fairs in Portsmouth where members of the public were filmed answering\u000a      questions about their\u000a      life. A selection of the oral history interviews and video material was\u000a      employed in the exhibition.\u000a    These interviews are an important legacy of the project, as another of\u000a      its achievements was to\u000a      have them digitised, transcribed and catalogued, making them permanently\u000a      available to the public\u000a      in the Portsmouth History Research Centre. This project overall has helped\u000a      to transform the\u000a      Portsmouth oral history archive from a relatively little-used local\u000a      resource to one with markedly\u000a      greater public use and regular access from international researchers (CS2\u000a      and CS4).\u000a    In summarising the impact of Beaven's research on the project, PCM noted\u000a      that his `input helped to\u000a      us to forge the key aim of involving people who were not natural\u000a      museum-goers and engage with\u000a      different viewpoints that captured a range of gendered, class, ethnic and\u000a      generational\u000a      perspectives.' (CS2) This success has led on to an extended engagement\u000a      between Beaven's work\u000a      and the City Museum, most recently in a successful HLF bid for him to\u000a      curate an exhibition on the\u000a      First World War in 2014 (CS2).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Brad Beaven's research into the changing character and form of popular\u000a      culture in the English city\u000a      between 1850 and 1945 underpinned the `Portsmouth Voices' project, a\u000a      collaboration with\u000a      Portsmouth City Museum supported by a &#163;223,500 Heritage Lottery Fund\u000a      award.

He is recognised as a leading authority\u000a      on popular culture and\u000a      the city in Britain between 1850 and 1945. His research approach has been\u000a      described as\u000a      successfully demonstrating `the fruitful intersection of social and\u000a      cultural history' (Supporting\u000a      evidence 1, references in parentheses are to items in Section 3).\u000a    A core feature of his work is the analysis of how working-class\u000a      communities responded to civic\u000a      initiatives aimed at influencing their working lives and leisure habits,\u000a      in peace and war (Output 1).\u000a      This interest in contextualising the relationship between working-class\u000a      culture and the city\u000a      developed into the research monograph Leisure, Citizenship and\u000a        Working-Class Men, 1850-1945\u000a      (Output 2). This book explored the issue of social class and identity in\u000a      the Midlands and\u000a      southeastern England. These regions experienced very different material\u000a      conditions to those of\u000a      northern England &#8212; traditionally the focus for studies of popular leisure\u000a      in the nineteenth and\u000a      twentieth centuries. To gain a broader comparative insight into the\u000a      experience of working-men's\u000a      leisure, Beaven conducted original research into a wide variety of primary\u000a      sources, including\u000a      government records, contemporary newspapers, youth organisation archives,\u000a      philanthropic\u000a      pamphlets, personal papers and oral histories.\u000a    Working at the forefront of an historiographical turn towards plurality\u000a      and diversity, the findings of\u000a      this research demonstrated the problems in assuming homogeneity in\u000a      working-class culture, and\u000a      illustrated the importance of gender and generation in the fostering of\u000a      working-class identities.\u000a      Beaven argued that male workers engaged with the new cultural forms of the\u000a      twentieth century and\u000a      negotiated their way into a reconstituted class identity in the midst of\u000a      mass culture. The book has\u000a      been recognised as making a notable contribution to the historiographical\u000a      field. Reviews in History,\u000a      the leading online journal published by the Institute of Historical\u000a      Research, praised it as `a\u000a      significant and timely contribution to our understanding of popular\u000a      leisure' (Supporting evidence 2).\u000a      Likewise, the Economic History Review commented that `Brad\u000a      Beaven's compelling new study re-asserts\u000a\u0009  the centrality of social class to our understanding of leisure in\u000a      modern Britain ...This is a\u000a      well-written, insightful, and absorbing study. It makes a valuable\u000a      contribution to the social history of\u000a      modern Britain' (Supporting evidence 3). In the book, and in other\u000a      peer-reviewed publications,\u000a      Beaven explored the internal dynamics of working-class communities through\u000a      a range of themes\u000a      not previously explored in conjunction, including teenage cultures,\u000a      courtship, and the gendered\u000a      nature of work and leisure patterns (Outputs 3 &amp; 4). These topics were\u000a      to set the agenda for the\u000a      projects discussed in Section 4.\u000a    Beaven is also recognised in his field for defining and analysing the\u000a      shifting nature of citizenship in\u000a      Britain, arguing that the concept had a close but complex connection to\u000a      the changing nature of\u000a      urban contexts between 1850 and 1945 (Output 5). Beaven's findings\u000a      demonstrate how citizenship\u000a      was identified with `exemplary' social groups, which in turn created an\u000a      exclusive rather than an\u000a      inclusive form of urban identity.

Building upon this established\u000a      record, Chafer's\u000a      research has, since 2008, had an impact on both the policy-making process\u000a      and decision-making.\u000a      Four different types of impact have resulted from the research:\u000a    Policy-making impact In September 2009, at the request of the FCO,\u000a      Chafer and Cumming\u000a      produced a private report (`France and Britain in Africa since Saint\u000a      Malo') for its Africa Strategy\u000a      Group, which was reviewing its representation in West Africa. It stressed\u000a      the importance of\u000a      engaging with francophone countries in West Africa: 'we got a lot from the\u000a      meeting' which `fed\u000a      usefully into the analysis' and provided `key insights into the\u000a      francophone piece we're examining as\u000a      part of the West Africa project' (email, 23.11.09, Strategic Policy\u000a      Adviser, FCO, source I). Following\u000a      this review the UK decided against closing some African missions, in Mali\u000a      for example, which\u000a      would have negatively impacted on HMG's ability to engage in the country\u000a      in 2013. Subsequently,\u000a      on 3 November 2010, hours after a groundbreaking UK-French defence\u000a      agreement, Professor\u000a      Chafer was invited to brief Henry Bellingham, FCO Minister of State, on\u000a      ways of improving UK-\u000a      French cooperation in Africa ahead of his visit to Paris for discussions\u000a      with his French counterpart.\u000a      `Mr Bellingham found the meeting very useful and interesting' (source VI).\u000a      `Your research project\u000a      on French and British Africa policy: understanding and improving\u000a      cooperation' was very timely. It\u000a      helped underpin the policy decision to burden-share with the French the\u000a      response to the crises in\u000a      the Sahel and North Africa, each contributing their respective strengths\u000a      in the area in a coordinated\u000a      way. Your meeting with the Africa Minister in late 2010 was very helpful\u000a      in setting the context for\u000a      this, as well as pointing out the imbalance between French and British\u000a      resources given to\u000a      ECOWAS . . . You followed this up with a well-received presentation in\u000a      late 2012 in Chatham\u000a      House for senior FCO and MOD staff on the opportunities for security\u000a      co-operation with France'\u000a      (source II).\u000a    Changing practice In November 2011, Chafer was invited to give a\u000a      briefing to MoD, FCO and DfID\u000a      officials on the research project's key findings and specifically to look\u000a      at opportunities for improving\u000a      HMG's engagement with the francophone countries in ECOWAS. As a result of\u000a      this briefing, the\u000a      FCO undertook to get a full time senior diplomat posted to Abuja to lead\u000a      on ECOWAS issues:\u000a      `Your contribution was thought provoking, and I am pleased that we are\u000a      already acting on getting a\u000a      full time senior diplomat posted to Abuja to lead on ECOWAS issues. I will\u000a      definitely be making\u000a      enquiries about getting a fluent French speaker in that role'. This advice\u000a      was subsequently taken\u000a      up and a French speaker appointed to this new post in Abuja (source V).\u000a    Policy legitimising impact: The research described here has had an\u000a      impact by providing a solid\u000a      evidence base for policy decisions that were being taken. For example, in\u000a      September 2012, Chafer\u000a      was invited to present the research findings to the influential France-UK\u000a      Defence Forum, which for\u000a      the first time included a session on military cooperation in Africa:\u000a      `British and French government\u000a      officials have looked into areas of convergence where security cooperation\u000a      might be possible and\u000a      your research has been very useful in serving to confirm and clarify\u000a      thinking that was already being\u000a      formulated with regard to cooperation, particularly on security issues in\u000a      Africa - as confirmed by\u000a      the French intervention in Mali and the support provided by the UK'\u000a      (source IV).\u000a    Institutional memory: The research project has served to sustain\u000a      the momentum of the Saint-Malo\u000a      process, in a context in which officials move posts every 3-4 years, with\u000a      the result that institutional\u000a      memory, particularly at middle and lower levels of government bureaucracy,\u000a      relating to\u000a      commitments made, lessons learned and opportunities identified, is often\u000a      uneven and patchy.\u000a      These exchanges refreshed and sustained institutional memory about the\u000a      Saint Malo process,\u000a      provided opportunities to discuss areas of Anglo-French convergence and\u000a      ensured that UK and\u000a      French officials were better aware of who they needed to talk to on the\u000a      French and UK side\u000a      respectively, something which is not always clear because of the different\u000a      institutional set-ups for\u000a      Africa policymaking in the two countries. The impact of the research was\u000a      to contribute to\u000a      embedding the practice of collaboration, particularly between\u000a      middle-ranking French and UK\u000a      officials `on the ground' in Africa thereby saving time, as officials did\u000a      not have to constantly\u000a      `reinvent the wheel', and reducing possibilities for misunderstanding.\u000a    Its significance can only be understood with reference to past\u000a      Anglo-French rivalry in Africa. The\u000a      two governments' decision to move from rivalry to cooperation in Africa\u000a      represented a paradigm\u000a      shift in policy. They now recognized that Anglo-French cooperation was\u000a      vital for security and\u000a      believed that, by working together, the UK and France could better tackle\u000a      the challenges facing\u000a      Africa while providing better value for money. However, they did not\u000a      sufficiently understand the\u000a      other country's outlook, approach, agendas and priorities, obstacles which\u000a      this research has\u000a      helped to overcome. By undertaking over 160 interviews with highly placed\u000a      officials and decision\u000a      makers and disseminating the key findings of the research widely through\u000a      academic publications,\u000a      policy briefings and high-level presentations to international thinktanks\u000a      (also published in open\u000a      access on their websites, sources VIII-X), the project contributed to\u000a      officials' understanding of each\u000a      other's policy agendas and priorities by identifying obstacles to enhanced\u000a      cooperation. In so doing\u000a      it helped to build trust and provided research-based policy\u000a      recommendations that fed into debates\u000a      that were taking place between policymakers about how and in what policy\u000a      areas to collaborate. It\u000a      thus formed part of the underpinning for these policy decisions.\u000a    The reach of its impact is national and international. This may\u000a      be gauged from the fact that the\u000a      presentations of the research findings were attended by officials from the\u000a      FCO (including Research\u000a      Analysts and Strategy Unit), MoD (International Policy and Planning),\u000a      DfID, the French Ministry for\u000a      Foreign Affairs (including the Director of the `P&#244;le politique europ&#233;en de\u000a      d&#233;veloppement'), the\u000a      Agence Fran&#231;aise de D&#233;veloppement (including the Head of its Fragile\u000a      States Unit), as well as\u000a      officials in Brussels, development practitioners and journalists. Chafer\u000a      also briefed the Foreign\u000a      Office Minister for Africa, Henry Bellingham, and Lord Chidgey,\u000a      identifying areas of convergence\u000a      and opportunities for cooperation and putting forward parliamentary\u000a      questions for Lord Chidgey to\u000a      ask in the House (source VII). `Your research has been most helpful in\u000a      serving to confirm, shape\u000a      and clarify the thinking that is beginning to be formulated in government\u000a      circles with regard to\u000a      cooperation . . . a number of the recommendations from your research were\u000a      subsequently taken up\u000a      by HMG'.(source III).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Political instability and insecurity in Africa have become increasingly\u000a      salient issues since the\u000a      1990s.

Chafer's research has had an impact in three main\u000a      ways: by providing\u000a      research-based evidence that has informed decision-making, by providing\u000a      policy recommendations\u000a      regarding opportunities for cooperation and by sustaining `institutional\u000a      memory' concerning the\u000a      Saint-Malo process, which promised enhanced Anglo-French cooperation on\u000a      Africa policy.

His 2002 book The End of\u000a        Empire (Ref 1)\u000a      demonstrated how and why sub-Saharan Africa became a key foreign policy\u000a      priority for France\u000a      after World War 2 and has remained so to the present day. Building on this\u000a      work, his 2002 and\u000a      2005 articles (Refs 2, 3) showed that French policy was moving away from\u000a      an exclusive focus on\u000a      its traditional sphere of influence in Francophone West and Central Africa\u000a      towards engagement\u000a      with the whole of the continent. In the context of this case study key\u000a      findings of the research were\u000a      that the French government wanted to shed its reputation as the `gendarme\u000a      of Africa', move away\u000a      from a unilateral approach to Africa and work with other external actors\u000a      to share the costs and\u000a      risks, of its engagement with the continent. This new approach opened up\u000a      possibilities for Britain to\u000a      cooperate with France on issues of mutual interest.\u000a    In 2007 Professor Chafer was awarded a British Academy grant as PI (in\u000a      collaboration with\u000a      Professor Cumming, Cardiff, who is a specialist notably on aid policy) for\u000a      a three-year research\u000a      project: `Towards a new policy partnership? France and Britain in Africa\u000a      since Saint-Malo', during\u000a      which over 160 interviews were conducted, in Europe, at the United Nations\u000a      and in Africa. This\u000a      practitioner-focused research remains unique, as the only externally\u000a      funded research project on\u000a      Anglo-French relations in Africa since the Saint Malo Franco-British\u000a      summit in 1998, when the two\u000a      countries agreed to cooperate on African issues. The project took as its\u000a      starting-point the\u000a      shortcomings of conventional unilateral and multilateral approaches in\u000a      dealing with many of the\u000a      challenges facing African societies, particularly those of insecurity,\u000a      poverty and governance. A\u000a      central issue addressed was the extent to which `bilateral' cooperation\u000a      between two external\u000a      actors, such as that proposed by the UK and France at Saint Malo, can\u000a      serve as a useful\u000a      complement to other approaches.\u000a    The project advanced understanding in two ways. First, it plugged\u000a      important empirical gaps by\u000a      explaining why cooperation is more advanced in certain fields (eg. peace\u000a      and security) than others\u000a      (eg. poverty reduction, development aid) and by producing the first\u000a      systematic study of Anglo-\u000a      French cooperation in crisis management in Africa. In so doing, this\u000a      research showed how and\u000a      explained why policy discourse on cooperation was not always followed\u000a      through in terms of actual\u000a      practice on the ground. Chafer's specific contribution in this respect was\u000a      in the field of security\u000a      cooperation (Refs. 4, 5, 6). Second, it provided an understanding of how\u000a      the two governments\u000a      came to their decision to move from rivalry to cooperation in Africa and\u000a      explained why Anglo-\u000a      French coordination often lacked substance. In particular, it showed the\u000a      importance of enhancing\u000a      policy coherence by deconflictualising positions and identified policy\u000a      synergies and opportunities\u000a      for cooperation in areas such as peace and security, poverty reduction,\u000a      human rights promotion\u000a      and governance. This has informed the policy-making process, notably by\u000a      explaining the\u000a      background to, and rationale for, UK and French positions on key issues\u000a      and indicating areas of\u000a      convergence where cooperation may be possible.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17094","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Assyrian Christian communities found in northern Iraq and north-western\u000a      Iran, which are their original places of residence, and also in many\u000a      refugee communities scattered around the world (in Europe, the USA,\u000a      Canada, the Caucasus and Central Asia) speak over 100 dialects of North-\u000a      Eastern Neo-Aramaic. Due to persecutions, nationalistic state policies,\u000a      forced evacuation of settlements and migration of speakers to the West,\u000a      the Aramaic language spoken by the Assyrian Christians (with all of its\u000a      various dialects) has been listed by UNESCO's Atlas\u000a          of the World's Languages in Danger as: `definitely\u000a      endangered'.\u000a    RAISING AWARENESS\u000a    Over the last few years, Khan has spoken to numerous Assyrian communities\u000a      and community leaders throughout the Assyrian Christian diaspora around\u000a      the world about his work and raised their awareness of the endangered\u000a      status of many of their dialects and the importance of documenting them\u000a      [5.1].\u000a    Khan has stressed in particular the need for native speakers of the\u000a      communities to be trained to carry out fieldwork and participate directly\u000a      in the documentation of their linguistic heritage. There has been a very\u000a      positive response to this engagement with the communities, evidenced, for\u000a      example, by the interview with Homer Ashurian, the head of the Assyrian\u000a      Universal Alliance, in a radio programme broadcast by Chicago's WCGO 1590\u000a      AM station on the 23rd of April 2012, in which he spoke about the\u000a      importance of Khan's work for the community and encouraged members of the\u000a      community to attend a lecture that was to be given by Khan in Chicago at\u000a      Northwestern University. An example of concrete evidence of such positive\u000a      response has been that of the Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation, a\u000a      leading US-based community group whose main focus is on community care,\u000a      community cultural programmes and assisting refugees. In 2011 they\u000a      provided financial support for a young Assyrian to undertake language\u000a      documentation work in Iraq under Khan's guidance to help preserve their\u000a      linguistic heritage (further details below).\u000a    Khan has been invited to address communities in public lectures in Europe\u000a      and the USA. Some of these public lectures stand out for having raised\u000a      considerable awareness about the language amongst the wider diaspora, e.g.\u000a      the talk given to the Assyrian American Association of Southern California\u000a      (on 10\/04\/11; approx. 100 attendees; uploaded into YouTube with over 438\u000a      views [by 31 July 2013]) [5.2], and the one at Northwestern University\u000a      (10\/05\/11; approx. 200 attendees; 1,453 YouTube views [31 July 2013])\u000a      [5.3]. The latter, which included a Q&amp;A session with members of the\u000a      audience, has been subsequently republished on community organisation\u000a      websites (e.g. ATRANEWS.com and the AUAF website); an Indian news website\u000a      (Firstpost) [5.4] and an excerpted version was created and uploaded by an\u000a      online forum discussant to a website (forumbiodiversity) [5.5]. On a\u000a      number of other websites, the Northwestern lecture and Khan's research\u000a      have been highlighted and recommended within debates about Assyrian\u000a      identity and linguistic heritage (e.g. [5.6] and [5.7]).\u000a    In September 2011 the Iranian Assyrian community published an article\u000a      about Khan's work and its importance for their community in a community\u000a      magazine Sh&#257;mir&#257;m (in Persian) [5.8]. In February 2013 an article\u000a      about the linguistic documentation work of Khan was published in the The\u000a        Smithsonian Magazine [5.9]. At the time of writing this report, the\u000a      article had received 4.6k Facebook `likes' on the Smithsonian website and\u000a      numerous comments from members of the Assyrian Christian community. The\u000a      contents of this article were reproduced in numerous media outlets in\u000a      print and on the web, including the sites of Assyrian community\u000a      organizations (e.g. [5.10]). After the publication of the article Khan was\u000a      invited to give interviews to numerous newspapers, e.g. The Jewish\u000a      Chronicle (8 Feb 2013), The Times of Israel (14 Jul 2013) and radio\u000a      networks, e.g. Irish National Radio, `Newstalk', 7th February 2013, US\u000a      National Public Radio (`The Story') (1 May 2013), BBC Radio 4\u000a      (`Broadcasting House', 9 June 2013). These led to various other newspaper\u000a      articles about his research, e.g. Nederlands Dagblad (1\/9\/2013, in Dutch).\u000a      Khan's work among the communities has also inspired several poets to write\u000a      poems about him and his efforts to preserve their language. [5.11]\u000a    PRESERVING HERITAGE\u000a    Much of the traditional lexicon and folklore is not known by the younger\u000a      generations. These documentation projects have been instrumental in\u000a      preserving knowledge of these endangered dialects for the communities.\u000a      Khan's numerous publications have made available full descriptions of a\u000a      variety of hitherto undescribed dialects. The NENA database, which was\u000a      completed in 2009, holds details of 135 dialects and preserves audio\u000a      recordings of songs and stories of over 33 dialects.\u000a    In addition to his publication programme and NENA database project, in\u000a      2011 Khan initiated the Modern Assyrian Language Documentation Project\u000a      (MALDP). An AUAF-funded fieldworker, trained by Khan, has undertaken\u000a      documentation among the Assyrian Christian communities of Iraq [5.12]. He\u000a      has also undertaken outreach activities, under Khan's guidance, about the\u000a      importance of preserving Assyrian linguistic heritage among communities in\u000a      the Middle East, Europe, North America and Australia (2011-2013). In Iraq\u000a      he has held training workshops in community centres in Dohok (August 2012,\u000a      approx. 100 attendees) and Qaraqosh (August, 2012, approx. attendees) and\u000a      distributed recording equipment. As one of the beneficiaries of Khan's\u000a      training has stated: `I really appreciate your help and advice. Thank you\u000a      again for your help and your great works you [have] done and you [are]\u000a      still doing for [the] Assyrian language.' [5.13]. The fieldworkers archive\u000a      their recordings in the local community centres and send copies to Khan in\u000a      Cambridge.\u000a    The recordings are uploaded onto Khan's online NENA database, the audio\u000a      archives of which are opening accessible to the public and contain\u000a      recordings of both Christian and Jewish dialects.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Geoffrey Khan has worked closely with the communities of\u000a      Assyrian Christians of the Middle East carrying out research on their\u000a      spoken language which exists in numerous dialects, many of them highly\u000a      endangered.

These are the last spoken vestiges\u000a      of the Aramaic language, which has deep historical roots in the Middle\u000a      East, the first attested records being datable to approximately 1000 BCE.\u000a      Khan's research has concentrated on the North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA)\u000a      group of dialects, which are spoken by Christians and Jews, whose original\u000a      places of residence were in northern Iraq, south-eastern Turkey, and\u000a      north-western Iran. All the Jews left the region in the 1950s and settled,\u000a      for the most part, in the newly founded State of Israel. A large\u000a      proportion of the Christian population has also left the region due to\u000a      political conflict and discrimination. As a result of these upheavals the\u000a      NENA dialects are now seriously endangered. Khan's research has involved\u000a      the undertaking of fieldwork in communities of NENA speakers in various\u000a      parts of the world. Most of the fieldwork on the dialects of the Jews has\u000a      been carried out in Israel. The fieldwork on the dialects of Christians\u000a      has been conducted among numerous communities, mostly those of refugees in\u000a      various places around the world, including Europe, USA, Canada, Australia,\u000a      the Caucasus and Central Asia. The considerable quantities of data that\u000a      have been gathered in such trips have been processed and form the basis of\u000a      several research products, including a series of books, articles, and an\u000a      on-line database. The books include detailed descriptions of the grammar\u000a      and lexicon of several dialects together with transcriptions and\u000a      translations of spoken texts, such as folktales, descriptions of\u000a      traditional life and customs, songs, etc.\u000a    For more than a decade Khan has trained a series of graduate students and\u000a      post-doctoral researchers in the field of Neo-Aramaic and has raised\u000a      research grant income to fund projects with research teams working on the\u000a      documentation of the dialects. One of the major projects, which was funded\u000a      by the AHRC (2004-2009), resulted in the construction of an on-line\u000a      database, The North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic Database. This database was\u000a      designed to make accessible in an efficient manner grammatical\u000a      descriptions and audio recordings of the dialects and in particular to\u000a      facilitate comparisons across the dialects. This archival resource was a\u000a      concept developed by Khan and was designed and constructed by him with the\u000a      assistance of a web-developer. The project team employed by Cambridge\u000a      University included the following research associates: Dr Eleanor Coghill\u000a      (2004-2009; now at Universit&#228;t Konstanz), Dr Roberta Borghero (2004-2009;\u000a      now in Jerusalem); Dr Alinda Damsma (2008-2010, now at University College\u000a      London).\u000a    The native term of the language is Suret\/Surayt and is subdivided into\u000a      various dialects, each displaying distinctive linguistic features. There\u000a      are some 150 different NENA dialects, each originally spoken in a\u000a      particular village or town in the mountains of Kurdistan. The chief\u000a      dialectal division within NENA is a confessional one: the Jewish dialects\u000a      share a large number of features that differ from the Christian dialects.\u000a      Within the same town Jews and Christians speak considerably different\u000a      dialects. The NENA dialects exhibit numerous fundamental differences from\u000a      earlier forms of Aramaic that are attested in written texts. Many of these\u000a      differences have arisen due to the contact that the NENA dialects have had\u000a      with other languages in the area, in particular Kurdish and Azeri Turkish.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17095","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"130758","Name":"Iran"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Project's exploration of the multi-dimensional appeal of the Shahnama\u000a      has promoted a greater\u000a      awareness of Persian culture in the West, particularly when it coordinated\u000a      its public engagement\u000a      activities with the UNESCO-recognised millennial anniversary of the\u000a      completion of the Shahnama\u000a      in AD 1010.\u000a    The online database created to support the Project documents manuscript\u000a      collections across the\u000a      world, including numerous private and semi-public collections which\u000a      normally restrict access.

The exhibition\u000a      received extensive media coverage (72 separate press cuttings logged) and\u000a      attracted 28,889\u000a      visitors and was visited by several school groups; Persian community\u000a      groups, interest groups such\u000a      as the Friends of the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, UK and overseas\u000a      collectors; and tourists.\u000a      The Museum's survey based on 126 respondents, indicated that 75% of the\u000a      visitors had come to\u000a      the museum specifically to see the exhibition (5). In September 2010, the\u000a      exhibition was\u000a      highlighted as a key UK tourist attraction: BBC History Magazine\u000a      website listed it among its top ten\u000a      `very best historical attractions', as did the Country Life\u000a      website for its `Best exhibitions to see this\u000a      September' feature (13\/09\/10). Melville has continued to work with other\u000a      cultural\/heritage\u000a      organisations hosting Persian exhibitions, such as the John Rylands\u000a      Library (Manchester) and the\u000a      State Library of Victoria (Melbourne, Australia), giving a public lecture\u000a      on both occasions\u000a      (Manchester, 25\/03\/10; 50 attendees; Melbourne 12\/04\/12, over 500\u000a      attendees (6).\u000a    The visitor survey and other forms of media such as online blogs offer an\u000a      indication of how the\u000a      exhibition gave the public new insights into Persian culture; one visitor\u000a      noted in a blog, that he was\u000a      `surprised by the clarity of certain illustrations, and how ideas and\u000a      stories were conveyed so\u000a      effectively even with a taste a thousand years old'. (7). For example,\u000a      visitor feedback demonstrated\u000a      that the exhibition raised a greater awareness of the cross-fertilisation\u000a      of Persian and Indian\u000a      cultural traditions, which was also raised by India's national newspaper,\u000a      The Hindu, subsequently\u000a      republished by the IRIB World Service website to highlight the role of\u000a      this exhibition in raising\u000a      awareness of the link between these two cultural traditions (8, 9).\u000a    These and other Iranian media agencies noted that Ferdowsi's legacy was\u000a      being commemorated\u000a      in the UK (10, 11, 12). The Foreign and Commonwealth Office further\u000a      recognising the importance\u000a      of the exhibition in relation to cultural diplomacy created a video in\u000a      Persian emphasising the\u000a      contribution of Persian culture, attracting 2729 views (13).\u000a    The exhibition catalogue, co-authored by Brend and Melville, was praised\u000a      by The Economist which\u000a      stressed its contribution to a better understanding Iran (14). The Museum\u000a      shop has sold 868\u000a      paperbacks and 75 hardbacks of the catalogue (943 hardback and 701\u000a      paperback copies sold\u000a      separately by the publishers) and 382 copies of the brief exhibition\u000a      guide. Attendance at the 5\u000a      lunchtime Gallery lectures in the Museum and the evening lectures in the\u000a      Faculty (max. 50) within\u000a      a larger programme of events including Persian music concerts (max. 180),\u000a      film screenings and\u000a      literary talks, reached full capacity. Media interest in the Shahnama has\u000a      continued beyond the\u000a      exhibition, with Melvyn Bragg hosting an In our Time episode\u000a      devoted to Ferdowsi and the\u000a      Shahnameh with Charles Melville as one of the three speakers\u000a      (13\/12\/12).\u000a    Inspired and informed directly by the research and the Cambridge\u000a      Shahnameh exhibition, a group\u000a      of Anglia Ruskin University students led by filmmaker, Sarah Gibson Yates,\u000a      created short films\u000a      which were aired at the Cambridge Picturehouse Cinema (15\/11\/10.\u000a    Similarly, Dr Fatima Zahra Hassan-Agha, following her association with\u000a      the Project, was inspired to\u000a      curate an exhibition of contemporary work of artists from Pakistan,\u000a      Russia, Australia and within the\u000a      Iranian diaspora, drawing its themes from the Shahnama, held in London's\u000a      Prince's Foundation\u000a      Gallery (16\/11\/10-13\/12\/10).

The technical development of the website\u000a      was undertaken by Mr\u000a      John Norman (Director of the University of Cambridge Centre for Applied\u000a      Research in Education\u000a      Technology - CARET; joint PI in phase 2 of the project (2006-9) and to\u000a      date, and Dr Dan\u000a      Sheppard (CARET) (2003-2011).\u000a    The project has sought to identify and analyse illustrated manuscripts of\u000a      the 11th-century Persian\u000a      national epic, the Shahnama or Book of Kings, and has created an\u000a      open-access online database\u000a      relating images to the text and creating a means of comparing illustrated\u000a      copies of the poem, and\u000a      the development of the iconography of different scenes, across the\u000a      centuries. The database\u000a      contains 20,300 recorded illustrations of scenes in the poem (the choice\u000a      of which is itself seen to\u000a      be significant), from 1,558 manuscripts. It provides a rich resource for\u000a      art historians, auction\u000a      houses and other specialists in Islamic art.\u000a    The underlying rationale of the research has been to explore the\u000a      multi-dimensional appeal of\u000a      Firdausi's Shahnama as history, literature, art and propaganda.\u000a      For many Iranians this great epic\u000a      poem (c. 50,000 verses) encapsulates a whole tranche of Iran's cultural\u000a      history and political\u000a      experience, focusing as it does on the glorious days of the Persian Empire\u000a      before the rise of Islam\u000a      and the Arab conquests in the 7th c. AD. It therefore provides\u000a      one of the key narratives of\u000a      `Iranianness' &#8212; one that is to an increasing extent seen as a rival\u000a      narrative to the `Islamic' and\u000a      specifically Shi'ite Muslim strand that also defines Iranian identity. In\u000a      short, the Shahnama has\u000a      always been a political statement and continues to be used as such, while\u000a      at the same time\u000a      qualifying in its own right as a major work of world literature. Part of\u000a      the response to this work has\u000a      been the tradition of the illustrating the text, which had a 550 year\u000a      history in the manuscript age (c.\u000a      1300-1850 in Iran), and it continues to be edited, reprinted and\u000a      illustrated in modern editions down\u000a      to the present day. This enables the study of the reception of the poem\u000a      not only in Iran and\u000a      neighbouring Muslim lands, but also more recently in the west.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17096","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    On 31 March 2011 the BBC published an article (in Chinese) summarizing\u000a      the book's main findings\u000a      [1]. The article introduces Professor Sterckx's research into\u000a      cooking and dining in ancient China\u000a      and how cooking and dining in ancient China reveals philosophical,\u000a      political and social thinking and\u000a      practice both in ancient and contemporary China. The first section is\u000a      entitled `governing is like\u000a      cooking' and stresses messages including harmony, fairness and equality.\u000a      The second section\u000a      refers to Professor Sterckx's work on dining etiquette in China and on the\u000a      importance of dining in\u000a      social life. The third section is entitled `food affecting virtue' and\u000a      focuses on how dining and food\u000a      was believed to affect and\/or reveal human character and personality.\u000a    On 6 April 2011 the BBC article was adapted and republished by China's\u000a      national news agency\u000a      Xinhua and the China State Council information office [2], [3].\u000a      From early May 2011, this article\u000a      was adapted for mock exams and teaching materials for the Chinese\u000a      University Entrance\u000a      Examinations, starting with Henan province (7 May 2011), and then across\u000a      all thirty-one provinces\u000a      in China except Tibet. Instruction is mainly through the form of mock\u000a      exams with teachers\u000a      explaining the questions in the class room. The mock exams cover contents\u000a      including etiquette in\u000a      social interactions, virtues, food nutrition and civilized, healthy life\u000a      styles. These are presented as\u000a      assisting in the construction of Chinese citizenship among teenagers\u000a      across China.\u000a    It is impossible to quantify exact user numbers across China since\u000a      schools have some freedom to\u000a      select teaching resources. But we can establish that in Jilin [7],\u000a      Jiangsu [10] and Shandong [11]\u000a      provinces, the article was included in a mock exam paper issued as\u000a      required materials for exams\u000a      across the province. In 2011 the total number of students enrolled in\u000a      higher education entrance\u000a      exams in Jilin province was 165,761 [5]. In 2012 it was 162,208 [6].\u000a      This suggests that, in Jilin\u000a      province alone, the number of students who have been exposed to the\u000a      article in examinations may\u000a      be as high as 160,000 per year.

In\u000a      Shandong, that figure was 550,677 in 2012 and 620,000 in 2011 [9].\u000a      It may be useful to know that,\u000a      in 2011, overall high school student numbers across China totalled\u000a      24,548,200 [12].\u000a    Keyword searches of Professor Sterckx's Chinese name &#32993;&#21496;&#24503; combined with\u000a      the Chinese terms\u000a      for food &#39154;&#39135; in standard search engines (e.g. Google) result in 53,900 hits\u000a      (24 March 2013).

He has held the position of\u000a      Professor since 1\u000a      October 2007. The research for his monograph Food, Sacrifice and\u000a        Sagehood in Early China was\u000a      carried out between 2006 and 2011.\u000a    The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the role of food and\u000a      sacrificial food culture in early\u000a      China (8th century BCE to 2nd cent. AD) based on a\u000a      careful analysis of received textual sources of\u000a      the period as well as recent archaeologically recovered manuscripts. The\u000a      research involved a\u000a      combination of text-critical and philological work combined with thematic\u000a      enquiries inspired by\u000a      theories that draw on anthropology and ritual studies. The monograph draws\u000a      on information from\u000a      across different types of sources, that is, its scope is not limited to a\u000a      particular \"genre\" of text, such\u000a      as medical or gastronomical texts. Sources included range from poetry,\u000a      historiographical narrative\u000a      and anecdotal literature to ritual compendia, administrative documents and\u000a      the works of the\u000a      masters of philosophy. By doing so, the book shows not only that the\u000a      culinary metaphor was\u000a      pervasive across early Chinese texts but, more importantly, that it served\u000a      as a prime vehicle to\u000a      convey ideas about self-cultivation and human character.\u000a    The book demonstrates in great detail how food culture provided a lens\u000a      through which the early\u000a      Chinese conceived of moral and social categories and shows how culinary\u000a      culture furnished\u000a      models for ideas about political authority and successful communication\u000a      with the spirit world.\u000a      Among the topics discussed are narratives on meat consumption, banqueting,\u000a      the figure of the\u000a      butcher-cook as political adviser, and Chinese perceptions of sensory\u000a      experience through flavour.\u000a      This study argues that the ritual world where \"table\" and sacrificial\u000a      altar met was a world marked by\u000a      contending views on the ways in which the ruler should sense the world.\u000a      Rather than seeking to\u000a      distinguish secular or profane food culture from the world of ritual\u000a      sacrifice, and rather than\u000a      identifying a transcendent spirit realm divorced from the physical\u000a      concerns of human society, early\u000a      China's ritualists saw in sacrifice a practice that confronted humans with\u000a      a fundamental paradox\u000a      between moral and material values: How can humans engage with an ephemeral\u000a      spirit world or\u000a      pursue higher forms of self-cultivation through physical means, either\u000a      through nutrition and other\u000a      forms of bodily comfort, or through the presentation of ritualized\u000a      offerings for the spirits? How can\u000a      humans generate forms of intangible spirit power internally within the\u000a      self, or communicate\u000a      externally with a spirit world that lies beyond normal channels of sensory\u000a      contact, while being\u000a      physically anchored in and dependent on a material and physical world that\u000a      constantly tempts their\u000a      sensory desires? Or, put differently, how does the exemplary person\u000a      distance him\/herself from\u000a      indulging in the physical delights of commensality and conviviality while\u000a      acknowledging that both\u000a      processes are necessary conduits to generate higher forms of authority\u000a      both in the human world\u000a      and in one's contact with higher powers?\u000a    While scholars in the West and China had researched the history of\u000a      gastronomy from a technical\u000a      perspective, there existed no monograph that examined food culture in the\u000a      world of ideas prior to\u000a      Professor Sterckx's work. The latter no doubt explains why his analysis\u000a      has stirred so much\u000a      interest in China.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19234","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2589581","Name":"Algeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2464461","Name":"Tunisia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"2461445","Name":"Western Sahara"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"285570","Name":"Kuwait"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"69543","Name":"Yemen"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Members of the MEC, including Ramadan, Willis, and Rogan, are frequently\u000a      invited to discuss their research with a variety of audiences in both the\u000a      Middle East and the West, including governmental policy groups, business\u000a      think-tanks, and public media gatherings. These diverse audiences have\u000a      benefited from informed analysis at a time of momentous political changes\u000a      in many Arab and North African countries.\u000a    Enhancing the capacity of Middle East politicians, governments and\u000a        states through advice and guidance: The MEC has played host to\u000a      meetings, conferences, and seminars, acting as a neutral place for\u000a      academic and non-academic discussions involving key players from several\u000a      North African states. In January 2011, a discussion on \"The Western Sahara\u000a      Conflict: Is there a Solution?\" featured speakers from Morocco and\u000a      Algeria. Representatives from the Polisario Front and the Moroccan Embassy\u000a      attended, enabling the two groups to express and exchange points of view\u000a      on the dispute. Later that same year, Ahmed Al-Shahi organised a series of\u000a      meetings under the auspices of the MEC's Sudanese Programme, with invited\u000a      participants from both the Sudanese regime and Southern Sudan [i].\u000a      These meetings provided a neutral forum for the two groups to meet and\u000a      talk in the period running up to the formal secession of Southern Sudan in\u000a      2011. MEC members have also participated in discussions on constitutional\u000a      reform in the countries concerned. For example, Willis was invited to\u000a      attend a two-day seminar on constitutional reform at Al Akhawayn\u000a      University, Morocco, in June 2011. The seminar developed recommendations\u000a      and presented them formally to the Moroccan Commission for Constitutional\u000a      Reform [ii].\u000a    MEC members have been invited to informal talks with select government\u000a      delegations and ambassadors. For example, in March 2011, Rogan opened\u000a      discussion at a Britain Club dinner hosted by the Kuwaiti Ambassador with\u000a      a talk on \"Arab Unrest: Where Are We Heading?\" The dinner was attended by\u000a      other ambassadors and MPs [1]. Later in the same year, Rogan\u000a      attended a series of sessions involving a Jordanian government delegation\u000a      comprising the Minister for Political Development, the Minister for Media\u000a      and Communications, former Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, and officials\u000a      from the Prime Minister's office and the Royal Court. A dinner for the\u000a      delegation at the House of Lords was hosted by Baroness Morris and Richard\u000a      Burden MP (Chair of the APPG on Jordan) [2].\u000a    Helping ensure Western policy-making and business relations are\u000a        informed by current research on the Middle East: Politicians,\u000a      government officials, and ambassadors (e.g. from the UK, US, and\u000a      Australia) have invited MEC fellows to provide background knowledge and to\u000a      discuss future approaches. Rogan met with HM Ambassador to Yemen in\u000a      October 2011 [3]. Willis gave a background lecture to the UK\u000a      Foreign Office on Modern Maghreb Politics in October 2012. In\u000a      December 2012, he contributed to a formal brainstorming session that was\u000a      assembled to brief the HMA Designate to Rabat on perspectives for Morocco\u000a      prior to his deployment to the region: the government wanted as much\u000a      background information and knowledge as possible because the degree of\u000a      change in Morocco had so greatly surpassed expectations [4].\u000a    In a more formal setting, Rogan was a witness (29 November 2011) at a\u000a      House of Commons Select Committee for Foreign Affairs meeting on British\u000a        Foreign Policy and the \"Arab Spring\". He is quoted extensively in\u000a      the report of the meetings. A conclusion drawn from his evidence,\u000a      regarding the inclusion of members of the British arms trade in the\u000a      delegation of a Prime Ministerial visit to the Gulf, was further discussed\u000a      in the Government Response to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs\u000a        Committee Report, although the Government ultimately rejected the\u000a      criticism made [iii].\u000a    The Conservative Middle East Council (CMEC) seeks to ensure that\u000a      Conservative party policy is grounded in a deep understanding of the\u000a      complexities of the region through enabling discussions between\u000a      Conservative parliamentarians and leading experts on the Middle East. The\u000a      CMEC has frequently consulted with members of the MEC in two main ways:\u000a      through briefings and through presentations to MPs in Westminster. For\u000a      example, in February 2011, an emergency session was convened to brief\u000a      parliamentarians on the extraordinary turmoil in the Middle East. The\u000a      assembled panel of leading expert commentators included Willis [iv].\u000a      Numerous CMEC publications, which were distributed widely among MPs and\u000a      members of the House of Lords, included contributions from MEC fellows\u000a      Rogan, Ramadan, and Daoudy; an example is the CMEC booklet \"The Arab\u000a      Spring: Implications for British Policy\" for the Conservative Party Annual\u000a      Conference of 2011 [v].\u000a    Think-tanks and strategy forums have extended invitations to MEC members\u000a      for advice on economic and business matters. Rogan has participated in\u000a      panel debates and has given lectures to organisations ranging from the\u000a      Global Strategy Forum to the Royal Institute of International Affairs\u000a      (Chatham House). In February 2011, Ramadan and Rogan were on a panel\u000a      convened at the Royal Geographical Society by Intelligence Squared, which\u000a      discussed \"Turmoil in the Arab World: Is the Genie of Democracy out of the\u000a      Bottle?\" Their participation led to further requests for meetings, e.g.\u000a      with a chief economist at Deutsche Bank [5] and the Britain Club\u000a      Dinner (see [1]).\u000a    On 16 December 2011, the Morocco Institute, in partnership with the\u000a      International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT) &#8212; The Hague, hosted a\u000a      meeting of experts, \"Political Transition and Stability on the Borders of\u000a      the Union: Morocco and North Africa\". The meeting brought together over 40\u000a      academics, practitioners, specialists, and policymakers with specific\u000a      knowledge of transitional processes in volatile environments or in-depth\u000a      regional expertise. Willis presented the keynote speech entitled \"Morocco:\u000a      The Arab Spring and the Challenge of Reform\" and is one of the experts\u000a      quoted on the webpage summarising the event [vi].\u000a    Enriching public understanding of events in the Middle East through\u000a        improving the quality of media coverage, informing other authors' works,\u000a        and participation in literature festivals and discussions: Public\u000a      interest in the revolutionary events surrounding the 2011 Arab Spring has\u000a      created greater demand for informed analysis from those with academic\u000a      understanding of the political situation. Members of the MEC have been\u000a      called upon regularly to provide expert commentary and accurate background\u000a      information for various international media outlets.\u000a    In addition to giving interviews to major UK and European radio and TV\u000a      news programmes on events following the Arab Spring in Tunisia and the\u000a      terrorist bombings in Marrakech, Willis has been interviewed several times\u000a      by the media local to the events, e.g. by 2M TV in Morocco and by local\u000a      press and media outlets in Tunisia [vii]. Examples of print media\u000a      contributions include an interview with Rogan discussing Egypt, which was\u000a      featured in \"Inside Story\" on Aljazeera in November 2012 [viii].\u000a      Willis is quoted in an article on Morocco's February 20 reform movement in\u000a      The National (Abu Dhabi Media company's first English-language\u000a      publication) [ix]. Advice to the media has extended beyond\u000a      contributing content to newspieces. In 2012, four fellows of the MEC\u000a      (Rogan, Willis, Al-Shahi, and Shlaim) were among 17 members of the\u000a      \"External Organisations and Individuals\" panel which contributed to a\u000a      formal review by the BBC Trust of the BBC's coverage of the events of the\u000a      Arab Spring [x].\u000a    The research of MEC fellows has also had an influence on popular\u000a      publications, such as the book by the BBC's Middle East correspondent,\u000a      Jeremy Bowen: The Arab Uprisings: The People Want the Fall of the\u000a        Regime (2012). Bowen quotes both Rogan and Ramadan and their books\u000a      and cites their publications. In his acknowledgements, he refers to \"the\u000a      brilliant and essential book The Arabs: A History\" [xii].\u000a    The publication of books such as The Arabs: A History has also\u000a      led to many opportunities to engage more directly with public audiences\u000a      through book launches and literary festivals. For example, in the UK Rogan\u000a      debated with Paddy Ashdown at the Sunday Times Oxford Literary Festival\u000a      2013. In March 2013 Rogan also participated in panel discussions and book\u000a      talks at the Emirates Festival of Literature, Dubai, UAE [xiii].\u000a      Such activities have enabled MEC members to enrich public understanding of\u000a      events in the Middle East itself.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Middle East Centre (MEC) has achieved a unique standing in providing\u000a      informed analysis of the region, based on its cumulative academic\u000a      expertise.

There are seven Fellows and five further Senior Associate Members.\u000a      This case study primarily concerns those whose research proved to be\u000a      directly relevant to understanding the events of what became known as the\u000a      Arab Spring of 2011.\u000a    Michael Willis, H.M. King Mohammed VI Fellow in Moroccan and\u000a      Mediterranean Studies since 2004, has conducted research into the\u000a      endurance of authoritarian political regimes in the central Maghreb. He\u000a      has sought to explain the longevity and resilience of the political\u000a      regimes in three states: Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. These states, which\u000a      achieved independence from colonial rule in the 1950s and 1960s, kept\u000a      their fundamental political structures intact for fifty years, in spite of\u000a      numerous challenges during their early decades. Willis' research found\u000a      that, despite the similarities between the three regimes and their\u000a      circumstances, each adopted a different strategy to ensure political\u000a      survival: Algeria's regime emphasised the centrality and cohesion of its\u000a      military; Tunisia's regime centralised political power; while in Morocco,\u000a      the monarchy's skill at co-opting and disarming challengers to its\u000a      authority enabled them to concentrate political power.\u000a    These findings then explained why the events of the Arab Spring had\u000a      markedly differing impacts on the three states. In Tunisia the regime was\u000a      overthrown. In Morocco it rapidly reformed itself. In Algeria, on the\u000a      other hand, the regime was unaffected by the popular protests sweeping\u000a      through the wider Arab world. The research concluded that the overthrow of\u000a      the Tunisian regime was due to its essential brittleness. It had relied\u000a      too much on coercion, and lacked alternative methods of dealing with\u000a      dissent and opposition. By contrast, the adaptability of the Moroccan\u000a      regime was demonstrated by the swiftness with which it was able to co-opt\u000a      and undermine protest movements by promising significant political reform.\u000a      Algeria had already experienced social and political upheavals in the\u000a      1980s and 1990s. Willis concluded that this turmoil, not the strength of\u000a      the military, had severely reduced any public appetite for revolutionary\u000a      political change.\u000a    Eugene Rogan has been Faculty Fellow and University Lecturer in the\u000a      Modern History of the Middle East since 1991. His research focuses on the\u000a      modern history of the Arab world, from the sixteenth century to the\u000a      present. His book, The Arabs: A History (2009), captures the\u000a      growing malaise in the Arab world at the start of the 21st century. It\u000a      argues that if the Arab world aspired to a new age of accountable\u000a      government and dignity, the Arab people would have to take the initiative\u000a      themselves. While not predicting the Arab Spring, it provides the\u000a      background knowledge and historical analysis necessary to understand the\u000a      wave of popular uprisings that swept the region in 2011: why they broke\u000a      out, and what forces have been shaping changes in the region since then.\u000a    Tariq Ramadan, Professor of Contemporary Islamic Studies since 2009, has\u000a      contributed substantially to highly visible public discussions of our\u000a      time: the destiny of Muslims in the West, and the Islamic revival in the\u000a      Muslim world. In his Islam and the Arab Awakening (2012), Ramadan\u000a      analyses and explores the challenges and opportunities that have arisen in\u000a      countries across North Africa and the Middle East. He asks whether\u000a      Muslim-majority countries can bring together Islam, pluralism, and\u000a      democracy without betraying their identity. He explores the reasons behind\u000a      the events of the Arab Spring and offers a commentary on what the future\u000a      might hold. The book is aimed both at the ordinary layperson and at\u000a      students and scholars of the Middle East. It has already been translated\u000a      into three languages: French, Turkish, and Arabic.\u000a    The research of three further fellows is relevant to the political and\u000a      social understanding of the Arab Spring: Ahmed Al-Shahi, Research Fellow\u000a      and co-organiser of the Sudanese Programme, whose research interests\u000a      include economic and social development, sectarian politics, and social\u000a      differentiations; Marwa Daoudy, Departmental Lecturer in the Politics and\u000a      International Relations of the Middle East, whose research concerns\u000a      international relations, non-traditional security studies, and conflict\u000a      and peace studies; and Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Fellow of St Antony's College,\u000a      formerly Professor of International Relations, whose main research\u000a      interest is the Arab-Israeli conflict.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19235","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The influence of Brock is attested to by representatives of the St Ephrem\u000d\u000a      Ecumenical Research Institute (SEERI) in Kottayam, Kerala: \"Catholics,\u000d\u000a      Orthodox, Protestants, Russians, Greeks, Lutherans, Copts, Ethiopians,\u000d\u000a      Georgians, St. Thomas Christians, Maronites, Armenians, Assyrians,\u000d\u000a      Chaldeans, Syrian Orthodox and Ukrainians, have all taken him as a kind of\u000d\u000a      Patriarch of Syriac studies, with unquestionable authority\" [1]\u000d\u000a    Brock's publications intended for Syrian Christian communities (as\u000d\u000a      described in section 2) are translated further and used all over the\u000d\u000a      world, extending the reach of his scholarly work into communities not\u000d\u000a      normally exposed to original research. Through his participation with the\u000d\u000a      St Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute \"there is a genuine revival of\u000d\u000a      Syriac studies in India\" [1].\u000d\u000a    Numerous invitations have arisen from Brock's world-wide reputation as a\u000d\u000a      scholar in the Syriac tradition to consult with a variety of religious\u000d\u000a      institutions on training courses and texts for religious formation offered\u000d\u000a      to those wishing to enter one of the Syriac churches. For example, SEERI\u000d\u000a      in India has established a correspondence course in English on Syrian\u000d\u000a      Christian Heritage, for which Brock has authored three of the nine\u000d\u000a      published course books [i]. At the Beth Aprem monastery Brock's\u000d\u000a      influence has meant that \"East Syriac is studied and used in Liturgy, a\u000d\u000a      new phenomenon in the much latinized Syro-Malabar Church\" [1]. He\u000d\u000a      has given lectures at seminaries across India such as the Orthodox\u000d\u000a      Theological Seminary (Kottayam), Malankara Syrian Orthodox Theological\u000d\u000a      Seminary (Mulanthuruthy) and Good Shepherd Seminary (Palai) [1],\u000d\u000a      and he has taught at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome [2].\u000d\u000a    As well as contributing to the education of those within Syriac churches,\u000d\u000a      Brock's publications serve as standard texts on numerous university\u000d\u000a      courses around the world, such as the unit East from Jerusalem:\u000d\u000a        Christianity in Premodern Asia taught in the Department of Religious\u000d\u000a      Studies, University of Oregon [ii] and Christianity along the\u000d\u000a        Silk Road in the Department of Near Eastern Studies, Princeton\u000d\u000a      University [iii].\u000d\u000a    Brock has played a significant role in ecumenical activities and related\u000d\u000a      ecclesiastical texts, for example in his \"translation of the `Burial\u000d\u000a      service' of monks (who are not priests) and nuns. The Syrian Churches were\u000d\u000a      trying for this translation for more than 100 years in vain\" [1].\u000d\u000a      This translation is used today by the St Thomas Christian Churches in\u000d\u000a      India.\u000d\u000a    The international standing of Brock's extensive research on the origins\u000d\u000a      of Christian religious traditions has led to his becoming a member of the\u000d\u000a      Pro Oriente Foundation, established to improve relations between the\u000d\u000a      Catholic and Oriental Churches. \"Its most recent meeting, held in January\u000d\u000a      2009, focused on the nature, constitution and mission of the Church. Brock\u000d\u000a      continues to be a critical resource for all parties in this dialogue. In\u000d\u000a      his publications he [ha]s illustrated again and again that Churches in\u000d\u000a      dispute with each other often share the same ideas though they speak\u000d\u000a      different languages\" [2]. Participation with the Catholic church\u000d\u000a      is further attested to: \"His scholarly and erudite presentation of the\u000d\u000a      Syriac anaphoras has practical implications for the ecumenical relations\u000d\u000a      among Christian churches today. He demonstrates how unity does not\u000d\u000a      necessarily mean uniformity. His recent publications (and they are many)\u000d\u000a      continue to open new avenues for dialogue between the Catholic and\u000d\u000a      Oriental Churches\" [2].\u000d\u000a    The president of Beth Mardutho, The Syriac Institute, New Jersey\u000d\u000a      summarises: \"Sebastian Brock not only had far-reaching effects on Syriac\u000d\u000a      scholarship in general (there is hardly a paper published that does not\u000d\u000a      cite his work), but was able to have a tremendous impact on the life of\u000d\u000a      Syriac Christianity today. One particular field that he affected is\u000d\u000a      ecumenism. Throughout his writings and lectures at official ecumenical\u000d\u000a      meetings, he brought together factions that have been separated for\u000d\u000a      generations. He played an important role in showing that the faith of the\u000d\u000a      Syriac Orthodox Church and that of the Church of the East, seen\u000d\u000a      traditionally as heretical, are indeed orthodox. He coined the term\u000d\u000a      miaphysite to replace the prejudicial term monophysite. Brock's term not\u000d\u000a      only received wide acceptance in scholarship, but was accepted formally by\u000d\u000a      the Patriarchs of the Oriental Orthodox churches as a term that correctly\u000d\u000a      describes their Christological formula. It is no surprise that Brock has\u000d\u000a      received the highest honors from the Syriac Orthodox Church and from the\u000d\u000a      Catholic Church.\" [3]\u000d\u000a    As well as having an influence within religious communities, Brock's\u000d\u000a      research has also been brought to bear on interactions between church and\u000d\u000a      state. The Mor Gabriel Syriac monastery in southern Turkey has had\u000d\u000a      troubled relations with the Turkish state, which in 2012 expropriated the\u000d\u000a      monastery's lands. Through his research, advice, and briefing papers,\u000d\u000a      Brock provided assistance to the Dutch MP P. H. Omtzigt, who with others\u000d\u000a      applied pressure on the Turkish government to return the lands, which they\u000d\u000a      did in 2013 [iv].\u000d\u000a    Several interviews given by Brock are available for all on the internet\u000d\u000a      and help circulate his findings to a wider audience. Melthodhaye, a Syriac\u000d\u000a      Christian Youth Organisation, has posted an interview with Brock from\u000d\u000a      their Second Annual Meeting in London, 2010 [v], where the\u000d\u000a      interviewer specifically mentions the importance of Brock's academic work\u000d\u000a      to the Syriac Church and language. A 2012 piece entitled \"Sebastian Brock\u000d\u000a      on the Syriac tradition in Christianity\" was filmed for an educational\u000d\u000a      portal of the Education Committee of the Russian Orthodox Church and had\u000d\u000a      been viewed by 4237 people on YouTube [vi]. In February 2013 Brock\u000d\u000a      participated in a public programme of study days, `Meeting the Fathers',\u000d\u000a      at the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies, Cambridge, teaching about\u000d\u000a      St Ephrem [vii] and the event has been made publicly available for\u000d\u000a      others to learn from [viii].\u000d\u000a    Brock's studies on Isaac the Syrian have significantly changed the\u000d\u000a      understanding of his teachings, leading to an upsurge in interest and\u000d\u000a      renewed publications and popular translations. For example, the monks at\u000d\u000a      the Greek Orthodox Holy Transfiguration Monastery in Boston relied on\u000d\u000a      Brock's work on the Syriac version of the text of Isaac's Ascetical\u000d\u000a      Homilies when they published an English translation of the 8th-9th century\u000d\u000a      Greek version. In the preface they referred to the \"debt every lover of\u000d\u000a      Syriac literature owes to Dr. Brock ... If Syriac studies are now more\u000d\u000a      popular than they have ever been, if the research on Saint Isaac in\u000d\u000a      particular is increasing, it is because those leading the way such as\u000d\u000a      Brock genuinely love their subject and encourage, rather than deter, those\u000d\u000a      who consider entering the field.\" [ix] Another example is a Dutch\u000d\u000a      translation of Brock's Wisdom of Saint Isaac the Syrian, produced by the\u000d\u000a      Syrian church in Holland [x]. Brock's English translations of\u000d\u000a      dialogue poems and hymns have been published in the liturgical manuals of\u000d\u000a      the Assyrian Church of the East. [xi].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Sebastian Brock's research on Syriac language, literature, and religion\u000d\u000a      has changed public understanding of the history of Christianity and\u000d\u000a      directly influenced the practices and beliefs of several Christian\u000d\u000a      communities, helping to overturn centuries of theological opinion and\u000d\u000a      persuading the leadership of western churches that Syriac Christianity is\u000d\u000a      not a heretical offshoot but a central part of its history and\u000d\u000a      development. The impact of his research is significant not just for\u000d\u000a      followers of the Syriac traditions, for whom he has authored many\u000d\u000a      resources for instruction and liturgy, but also for other denominations,\u000d\u000a      including the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches and Roman Catholicism.\u000d\u000a      His research opened the way to stronger relations among these communities,\u000d\u000a      leading to official doctrinal agreements between the Roman Catholic church\u000d\u000a      and the Syriac language-using churches.

He has\u000d\u000a      published more than 40 books and 450 articles, as well as liturgical texts\u000d\u000a      and translations that Syriac churches in many parts of the world use in\u000d\u000a      instruction and practice. The combination of techniques that he brings to\u000d\u000a      bear on his material has enabled him to have a transformative effect:\u000d\u000a      rigorous philology, high proficiency in an unusual range of languages &#8212;\u000d\u000a      Syriac, Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Coptic, and Armenian &#8212;\u000d\u000a      unmatched paleographical skills, literary and aesthetic sensibility, and\u000d\u000a      extensive theological and historical grounding.\u000d\u000a    Brock has taken what had been seen as a peripheral, minor language for\u000d\u000a      the study of Christianity (Syriac), and through his scholarly work has\u000d\u000a      persuaded academic historians of Christianity, including figures such as\u000d\u000a      Peter Brown and Diarmaid MacCulloch, that far from being marginal, the\u000d\u000a      doctrines and texts of Syriac authors are fundamental to understanding the\u000d\u000a      history of the pre-medieval church. Syriac Christianity, he has\u000d\u000a      consistently argued, is one of the faith's central varieties and needs to\u000d\u000a      be seen alongside the Latin and Greek traditions as constitutive in the\u000d\u000a      religion's history. Brock has shown that Syriac poets, mystics, and\u000d\u000a      theologians influenced other Christian traditions and early Islam.\u000d\u000a    In the 5th century Christian churches divided into several doctrinal\u000d\u000a      groups, causing a rift between, on one side, the Roman and Orthodox\u000d\u000a      churches, and on the other the churches on and beyond the eastern edges of\u000d\u000a      the Roman empire: Nestorian, Syrian, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopian. For\u000d\u000a      many centuries, western academic theology had been entirely attuned to\u000d\u000a      western, Catholic and Protestant, doctrine, and viewed communities such as\u000d\u000a      Syrians and Nestorians as heretical. In turn the eastern churches and\u000d\u000a      their theologians responded with antipathy to the western churches.\u000d\u000a      Brock's works present evidence-based studies which show that differences\u000d\u000a      in doctrine over such matters as the ontology of Christ are smaller than\u000d\u000a      thought and that most perceived `heresies' are not actual, that is, are\u000d\u000a      not supported by the Syriac texts of the eastern traditions to which they\u000d\u000a      had been attributed.\u000d\u000a    We give three of many examples here. The Greek, Russian, and Syrian\u000d\u000a      churches had held the 7th century Isaac the Syrian of Nineveh as a\u000d\u000a      foundational figure for the understanding and practice of mysticism. This\u000d\u000a      position was based on their knowledge of Isaac's Ascetical Homilies, only\u000d\u000a      the first part of which was extant. Brock discovered, edited, and\u000d\u000a      translated the lost second part, publishing it in 1995 (followed by\u000d\u000a      popular versions in English [1997, 2006], Arabic [1998], Dutch [2002,\u000d\u000a      2008], German [2003], and French [2010]). His discovery doubled the known\u000d\u000a      oeuvre of this key figure in eastern Christian monastic spirituality. Some\u000d\u000a      ideas in the rediscovered part, such as Isaac's belief in universal\u000d\u000a      salvation (even for non-Christians, the wicked, and demons), which are not\u000d\u000a      present in the previously known portion of Isaac's work, have provoked a\u000d\u000a      radical rethinking of his significance for the eastern churches.\u000d\u000a    Brock's work on Ephrem the Syrian shows that, though largely downplayed\u000d\u000a      as a literary figure in western scholarship for centuries, he was one of\u000d\u000a      the greatest poets in Christianity, to be compared with Dante, and as a\u000d\u000a      poet had an entirely different, symbolic way of doing theology. Churches\u000d\u000a      and scholars accept Brock's appraisal, and the Syrian churches now\u000d\u000a      consider Ephrem their foundational poet-theologian. Modern renderings of\u000d\u000a      Ephrem's poetry have been published recently in languages of India and the\u000d\u000a      Middle East, many of them inspired by Brock's work and produced for a\u000d\u000a      readership in the religious community.\u000d\u000a    Poetry is integral to Syriac liturgies. The nature of the material and\u000d\u000a      its liturgical uses led to excerpting, scattering, and reorganisation of\u000d\u000a      individual verses of poems, mostly from the 5th century. Brock has\u000d\u000a      reconstructed the original texts of many of these poems, using manuscripts\u000d\u000a      and the comparison of extant liturgical material in a variety of\u000d\u000a      languages. These reconstructions have usually been published not by\u000d\u000a      academic houses but in series produced by religious institutions. Thus,\u000d\u000a      the Treasure House of Mysteries (see section 3) appeared in the\u000d\u000a      Popular Patristics Series from St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, the organ of\u000d\u000a      a Russian Orthodox seminary. These publications usually include Brock's\u000d\u000a      English translations, ensuring that his entirely original and highly\u000d\u000a      rigorous research feeds directly into the liturgies of the eastern\u000d\u000a      churches, who are often happy to use his translations in reformulating\u000d\u000a      their practice. Scholars in the field also consult these works because of\u000d\u000a      their significance.\u000d\u000a    Brock's research cannot be separated from his outreach and\u000d\u000a      knowledge-exchange activities. Throughout his career he has engaged not\u000d\u000a      only with theologians, historians, and philologists, but also with living\u000d\u000a      Christian communities. The Patriarch of the Syrian Orthodox Church\u000d\u000a      bestowed on him the title of Commander of St. Ephrem, an honour never\u000d\u000a      before awarded to a layperson. The same Church has declared him one of the\u000d\u000a      very few Doctors of its faith. For his ecumenical writings and activities,\u000d\u000a      the Roman church has made him a papal knight. His major research findings\u000d\u000a      are disseminated in scholarly articles, in publications aimed at\u000d\u000a      non-academic readers, as well as through his energetic ongoing involvement\u000d\u000a      in guiding study and research in Syriac by practitioners within the\u000d\u000a      Christian communities.\u000d\u000a    Sebastian Brock was Reader in Syriac Studies from 1974 to 2003. Since his\u000d\u000a      retirement he has been Professorial Fellow of Wolfson College, University\u000d\u000a      of Oxford and continues to be an active researcher.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20180","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1873107","Name":"North Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Swenson-Wright's research and related-activities have had an impact on\u000a      five broad categories of actors: business and the private sector;\u000a      government; the military; the media and the general public; and\u000a      nongovernmental organizations.

Since 2010 Dr Swenson-Wright has been centrally\u000a      involved in both these initiatives and his research findings have helped\u000a      to shape the deliberations and findings of the GAC and in turn the\u000a      position of the WEF through direct discussions with senior figures in the\u000a      WEF, including Klaus Schwab, Executive Director of the WEF. (See 5.1)\u000a    b. Dr Swenson-Wright has also provided consultative advice over the past\u000a      two years to two key private organizations that have been involved in\u000a      direct talks with the DPRK, viz. The Elders, an independent group,\u000a      established in 2007 of former global leaders, including Kofi Annan and\u000a      Jimmy Carter; and Intermediate, a UK based private consulting firm headed\u000a      by Tony Blair's former Chief of Staff.

(See 5.6 and 5.7)\u000a    c. Dr Swenson-Wright has worked in close collaboration with the UK\u000a      Embassy in the DPRK and the British Council to facilitate the Chevening\u000a      Scholarship scheme, enabling two DPRK students\/officials to study at\u000a      Cambridge in 2011-12; a further two students are expected at Cambridge for\u000a      the 2013-14 year under the same scheme.

Via his membership since 2008 of the UK-Korea Forum for the Future, Dr\u000a      Swenson-Wright's has helped shape the annual policy recommendations that\u000a      the Forum provides to the UK and ROK governments. These have included\u000a      recommendations supporting the promotion of Korean studies in the UK and\u000a      educational exchange between the UK and the DPRK. (See 5.3)\u000a    e. Through the presentation of his research on Korea to the 2013 meeting\u000a      of the UK-Japan 21st Century Group, Dr Swenson-Wright has\u000a      similarly shaped the policy recommendations on regional security of the\u000a      UK-Japan 21st Century Group to the UK and Japanese governments.\u000a    f. Through two visits to the DPRK in 2004 and 2012, Dr Swenson-Wright was\u000a      able to liaise directly with DPRK government officials, academics and\u000a      representatives of the DPRK Writers Union, thereby facilitating academic\u000a      exchange and establishing the foundation for the planned Literary\u000a      Festival.

Dr Swenson-Wright's research has directly informed the interviews and\u000a      analytical pieces he has provided to the international media. For example,\u000a      the BBC has commissioned numerous opinion pieces from him and these are\u000a      accessible to a global audience online, along with broadcast television\u000a      and radio pieces. Such commentary is also available to BBC journalists who\u000a      have used his expertise in their reporting on Korea and East Asia. (See\u000a      5.8 to 5.15 inclusive)\u000a    b. Dr Swenson-Wright has also provided \"expert commentary\" on Korea and\u000a      Japan, online, via the Asia Program at Chatham House, to which he has been\u000a      affiliated since 2002. At Chatham House he has hosted a number of\u000a      international conferences, most recently in 2013 on Japan, which have\u000a      typically attracted audiences (composed of the general public) in excess\u000a      of 200 people.

He\u000a      became a Lecturer in 1996 and a Senior Lecturer in 2008. His research is\u000a      on the international relations of Northeast Asia, with reference to the\u000a      security challenge of a nuclear North Korea and its impact on regional\u000a      political and security alliances involving the United States, Japan, and\u000a      South Korea. It involves exploring the options for using international\u000a      engagement with the DPRK as a means of alleviating regional tensions and\u000a      re- integrating the DPRK into the international community. In the latter\u000a      case, the issue of providing humanitarian, cultural and educational\u000a      assistance to the DPRK, whether via NGOs or individual governments (such\u000a      as the UK) is an important practical issue that stems directly from his\u000a      research.\u000a    By analysing both the historical evolution of the policies towards the\u000a      DPRK of key regional actors in Northeast Asia, notably the United States,\u000a      South Korea and Japan, as well as contemporary developments in North Korea\u000a      policy, Dr Swenson-Wright's research has highlighted the strengths and\u000a      weakness of a competing range of policies towards the North, encompassing\u000a      economic and political sanctions, positive inducements such as partial\u000a      political and diplomatic recognition and various forms of engagement,\u000a      including the provision of humanitarian aid, economic assistance and\u000a      cultural and educational contact.\u000a    Methodologically, Dr Swenson-Wright's research has involved an exhaustive\u000a      study of the secondary and primary literature relating to East Asian\u000a      Security and the DPRK. It has also involved direct contact, interviews,\u000a      and practical cooperative initiatives with government officials,\u000a      academics, NGO representatives, journalists and human rights activists and\u000a      military personnel in the UK, US, Japan, South Korea and the DPRK. This\u000a      direct contact, based on lengthy periods of research leave in East Asia\u000a      and extensive language training in both Korean and Japanese, has been\u000a      indispensable in allowing him to assess the merits of different approaches\u000a      for dealing with the DPRK.\u000a    Through his involvement and leadership role in a number of track II and\u000a      track 1.5 initiatives sponsored by organizations such as the Korea Global\u000a      Agenda Council of the World Economic Forum, the UK-Korea Forum for the\u000a      Future, the UK-Japan 21st Century Group, Chatham House, the\u000a      Pyongyang Literary Festival voluntary organization, and the Nippon\u000a      Foundation, Dr Swenson-Wright has been able to directly observe and assess\u000a      the efficacy of a number of different approaches for dealing with the\u000a      DPRK. His research has concluded that, notwithstanding the importance of\u000a      close coordination between the US and its regional allies as well as the\u000a      use of sanctions and incentives in encouraging the DPRK to abandon its\u000a      provocative stance on nuclear weapons, sustained progress with North Korea\u000a      requires a serious commitment to long-term engagement with the DPRK in the\u000a      broad arena of cultural, educational and diplomatic contact. \"Engagement\"\u000a      in this context should be seen not as a reward to the North for\u000a      constructive behaviour, but rather as an end in itself &#8212; a necessary\u000a      process that can help to create confidence and trust between the key\u000a      regional actors.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21062","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3562981","Name":"Cuba"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Memories of a Lost Shark is a project in which text and image\u000a      combine to explore the role of\u000a      photography and literature and the way in which these two mediums may both\u000a      complement and\u000a      invade each other's spaces &#8212; a construct that allows for us to deal with,\u000a      and make sense of, the\u000a      various themes we attach to Cuba. In the project, the correspondence\u000a      between a series of black\u000a      and white photographs and texts invites the spectator to enter a\u000a      conversation with both\u000a      photographer and writer in an act of imaginative solidarity with the\u000a      content revealed in both the\u000a      texts and images. The project offers alternative ways of seeing Cuba's\u000a      past, present and future,\u000a      presenting an opportunity for the rethinking of different myths and\u000a      realities which have formed\u000a      (and, at times, distorted) representations of the nation over the course\u000a      of the last century. In doing\u000a      so, it also uncovers and contests new and different knowledges relating to\u000a      Cuba and the city of\u000a      Havana by mapping out new imaginaries and narratives via a form of visual\u000a      storytelling. In\u000a      Memories of a Lost Shark, these different realms are informed,\u000a      first and foremost, by the passing\u000a      of time and by our memories of it, but also by the way in which these\u000a      memories are evidenced and\u000a      recorded by both the photographic and written text. Through engaging with\u000a      the public in\u000a      photographic exhibitions and talks, the project develops understanding of\u000a      the processes by which\u000a      visual imaginaries are constructed and communicated, and raises public\u000a      awareness of the\u000a      idealisation and metaphorical imaginaries of space and place. This has\u000a      been enabled by the\u000a      application of theories and ideas relating to documentary photography and\u000a      psychogeography,\u000a      previously explored in Kent's research in the field of Cuban and visual\u000a      culture studies (as noted\u000a      above), that are now being made visible through his touring exhibition.\u000a    Kent's collaboration with Edmundo Desnoes has developed directly out of\u000a      his discussions with the\u000a      writer regarding documentary photography (September 2012 &#8212; September\u000a      2013), with a focus, first\u000a      and foremost, upon the way in which both the photographer and the writer\u000a      deal with the key\u000a      themes and ideas relating to psychogeography and urban experience.\u000a      Desnoes' review of a re-\u000a      publication of Walker Evans's Cuban portfolio in Aperture magazine\u000a      (Summer 1990) formed the\u000a      basis for this exchange. In his review, Desnoes commended Evans's\u000a      photographic style at this\u000a      formative stage of his career, which he saw as bearing `no theatrical\u000a      dramatization of\u000a      underdevelopment,' in turn uncovering a more transparent representation of\u000a      city-life which forced\u000a      the viewer to `contemplate with a poignant and indifferent eye the\u000a      poverty, the flow of quotidian\u000a      existence.' This reading of the role of the documentary photographer\u000a      markedly informed the shape\u000a      of the research project in terms of its theoretical and visual formation,\u000a      and the resultant exhibitions\u000a      have been acknowledged by experts in the field as a product of this\u000a      dialogue. This has been\u000a      reflected in the project, for instance, through both Kent and Desnoes'\u000a      continuous recalling of\u000a      Evans's influential and self-penned \"documentary style\" in their\u000a      collaboration. This is illustrated\u000a      within the framework of the exhibition itself, in which Desnoes'\u000a      meditation on the photograph El\u000a        vagabundo (The Wanderer) reflects upon the image in question\u000a      as redolent of the representation\u000a      of poverty depicted by a number of influential documentary photographers,\u000a      including Walker\u000a      Evans, Cartier-Bresson, Capa and Frank; `[this photograph] keeps us aware\u000a      of the heartrending\u000a      plight of those that ironically survive thanks to our crumbs.'\u000a    As noted above, Memories of a Lost Shark has been made accessible\u000a      through travelling\u000a      international public exhibitions, gallery talks and events, as well as\u000a      through online galleries\u000a      available on Kent's website, jckent.com.\u000a      Combined, these have had an educational impact upon\u000a      public discourse and have raised cultural awareness of the project's main\u000a      themes. His exhibition at\u000a      Oriel Colwyn, North Wales (approximately 30-50 visitors daily, open daily\u000a      1000-1700, 1-21 June\u000a      2013) represented the first public display of the project. This exhibition\u000a      was accompanied by a\u000a      series of public events, the first being an opening reception alongside a\u000a      screening (31 May 2013)\u000a      of Memories of Underdevelopment (directed by Tom&#225;s Guti&#233;rrez Alea,\u000a      1968) with approximately\u000a      150 members of the public in attendance (150 tickets sold via Theatr\u000a      Colwyn and Venue Cymru). A\u000a      second event, a photographer's talk, which was open to the public\u000a      (audience of 25, 19 June 2013),\u000a      brought together scholars, practitioners and the local community. The\u000a      follow-up exhibition to this\u000a      first show took place in La Habana del Este, Havana, Cuba, at the Galer&#237;a\u000a      Fayad Jam&#237;s: Centro de\u000a      Arte y Literatura (approx. 30-50 visitors daily, open daily 1000-1800,\u000a      1-24 July 2013), with an\u000a      opening reception taking place to mark its inauguration (2 July 2013, 60\u000a      in attendance).\u000a    By using these exhibitions as a platform for the dissemination of Kent\u000a      and Desnoes' collaborative\u000a      work, the impact from this project has enriched cultural awareness of\u000a      local and global cultural\u000a      heritage and has provided expert opinion on presenting this to the public.\u000a      More specifically, its\u000a      educational impact has been to enhance the public view of existing\u000a      dominant representations of\u000a      Havana, deconstruct the visual imaginary into component visual and\u000a      ideological constructs, and\u000a      make visible this deconstruction through photographic representations of\u000a      contemporary Cuba. The\u000a      project has also provided an interface through which the public,\u000a      professionals and academics have\u000a      been able to explore new ways of engaging with space and place as a\u000a      socio-cultural product. In\u000a      North Wales, the public were engaged via the exhibition, opening reception\u000a      and photographer's\u000a      talk, as outlined above. In Havana, the exhibition benefitted from an\u000a      opening event in which the\u000a      exhibition's inauguration and an artist's workshop were combined. In the\u000a      case of both exhibitions,\u000a      the public included academics, artists, curatorial and gallery staff,\u000a      cultural advisers, the local\u000a      community, photographers and practitioners. Kent's photographer's talk in\u000a      North Wales was\u000a      presented as a workshop in which he explained both his methods and\u000a      processes in creating and\u000a      selecting the photographs that form part of the exhibition and the\u000a      development of his collaboration\u000a      with Desnoes. This generated further discussion between the participants\u000a      relating to both the way\u000a      in which we deconstruct visual imaginaries of historically `othered'\u000a      spaces, but also regarding the\u000a      influences at work in our construction of them. These events represented\u000a      attempts to further\u000a      develop public understanding and to engage public awareness as to the way\u000a      in which Cuba\u000a      continues to be framed by the foreign image-maker. Both of these opening\u000a      receptions offered a\u000a      chance for Kent to introduce the project to both British and Cuban artists\u000a      and the public, whilst also\u000a      providing an opportunity to explore a number of the themes relating to the\u000a      ways in which both\u000a      photographers and writers, especially in the case of Cuba, have engaged\u000a      with the construction of\u000a      space and place as a socio-cultural product. This was exemplified at the\u000a      opening reception for\u000a      Memories of a Lost Shark in Havana, at which the exhibition's\u000a      cultural adviser described the show\u000a      in a recorded interview as `an excellent opportunity to look from a Cuban\u000a      perspective at the way in\u000a      which a British photographer's lens captures images of our country'. In\u000a      doing so, he also affirmed\u000a      that the show was one of the many dialogues that have taken place between\u000a      Cuba and the\u000a      outsider in relation to the representation of physical spaces,\u000a      anthropological constructions, and the\u000a      socio-political condition of the nation's people. Over the course of the\u000a      exhibition's run in both North\u000a      Wales and Cuba, Kent was also in a position to discuss the practice of\u000a      photography with other\u000a      artists and to compare different conceptual readings of the project with\u000a      them inside the gallery\u000a      space. The educational impact of these events was highlighted in guestbook\u000a      comments, recorded\u000a      interviews and reports of the exhibition on jckent.com.\u000a    Publicity for the project, both at home and abroad, has benefited from a\u000a      strong online presence\u000a      created through the use of online media and social networks. Kent's\u000a      professional photographic\u000a      website also provided a platform for an online exhibition of the project,\u000a      receiving several hundred\u000a      visits during Summer 2013 (Google Analytics data), and coverage of the\u000a      exhibitions in North Wales\u000a      and Cuba has also been shared extensively by the public on Facebook and\u000a      Twitter. The opening\u000a      reception in North Wales benefitted from creative use of social media and\u000a      extensive publicity via a\u000a      number of different networks and institutions (including Redeye: The\u000a      Photography Network and\u000a      Venue Cymru), whereas the opening reception in Havana was recorded by the\u000a      national press and\u000a      later publicised in television and radio coverage throughout the run of\u000a      the exhibition. In addition to\u000a      featuring on various radio programmes (Radio Metropolitano, Radio Taino\u000a      [twice weekly, 1-24\u000a      June 2013], Habana Radio [part of Friday's Revista Cultural- 2-5pm], Radio\u000a      Reloj, Radio Rebelde\u000a      &#8212; Revista Diaria [daily, 1-24 June 2013]), footage of the opening event\u000a      and a review of the\u000a      exhibition were televised in the national news, broadcast by Cubavisi&#243;n\u000a      International (15 July\u000a      2013) &#8212; available to in excess of 2.5 million homes in Cuba and shown\u000a      throughout the Americas,\u000a      Europe, North Africa and parts of Europe. In this televised review, the\u000a      reporter highlighted that\u000a      whilst the photographs work as standalone images, the texts \"underscore\"\u000a      them, in turn imbuing\u000a      the spectator's experience with a sense of the writer\/photographer's\u000a      experience and a \"knowledge\u000a      of the psychology of those represented [in the frame]\".\u000a    The successful delivery of these exhibitions has led to the creation of\u000a      an on-going dialogue\u000a      between Kent and members of the various groups that have been involved\u000a      with Memories of a Lost\u000a        Shark (from curatorial staff to workshop participants). The product\u000a      of this dialogue has been\u000a      continued educational impact upon public discourse and cultural life,\u000a      initially documented, as noted\u000a      above, in guestbook comments, recorded interviews and reports of the\u000a      exhibition, available on\u000a      jckent.com, but also supplemented\u000a      more recently by artists and writers who have written about and\u000a      shared the project's findings online.\u000a    Kent has been invited to exhibit the project in various forms over the\u000a      course of the next 12 months.\u000a      Memories of a Lost Shark will be shown from 17 October\u000a      to 17 December 2013 in Manchester at\u000a      the Instituto Cervantes, and will again be accompanied by a series of\u000a      public events, including an\u000a      opening reception (17 October 2013) and a series of workshops.

Memories\u000a        of a Lost Shark has challenged these varied\u000a      representations, which multiplied in the wake of the worst years of the\u000a      Cuban Special Period\u000a      (1991-1994), and its key research insight has been to offer different ways\u000a      of engaging with the\u000a      space and place of Havana as a socio-cultural product via text and image.\u000a      The project,\u000a      underpinned by Kent's work in the fields of Cuban and visual culture\u000a      studies, has provided a\u000a      platform for further scrutinising the way in which image-makers frame a\u000a      psychogeographical\u000a      experience of cultural space and for reconsidering how these framings are\u000a      interpreted by the\u000a      reader\/spectator. One of the most significant aspects of this research\u000a      project has been his\u000a      practice-led approach and this has been acknowledged by those working in\u000a      the aforementioned\u000a      areas of study as not only an important contribution to new scholarly\u000a      approaches to Cuban visual\u000a      cultures but also of considerable significance to the wider public on both\u000a      a national and\u000a      international level.\u000a    Over the course of the last decade, Kent has built upon a body of work\u000a      relating to the proliferation\u000a      of Cuban visual constructs within the global imaginary. This work\u000a      originally took shape in his\u000a      doctoral project at Royal Holloway, University of London, between\u000a      September 2008 and February\u000a      2012. This period of research benefited from AHRC funding and was further\u000a      developed through\u000a      archival research relating to documentary photography completed at the\u000a      Metropolitan Museum of\u000a      Art in New York City, and through collaboration with the Cuban writer\u000a      Edmundo Desnoes in May\u000a      and June 2012, which was funded by a Santander Universities research\u000a      award. Since this\u000a      collaboration, Kent has reflected further on the methods and processes of\u000a      the documentary\u000a      photographer and the way in which these are informed by the practice of\u000a      psychogeography. He\u000a      has developed his theoretical discussion of this by further exploring the\u000a      act of urban wandering and\u000a      the figure of the fl&#226;neur and is suggesting that these practices\u000a      directly inform the photographer's\u000a      visual understanding of the physical presence of the city. Kent's research\u000a      seminar on documentary\u000a      photography and psychogeography on 22 February 2012-part of a Royal\u000a      Holloway, University of\u000a      London, seminar series on `The Fl&#226;neur' &#8212; was made available as a podcast\u000a      on iTunes following\u000a      the event and received approximately 800 downloads at http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/kmx3p9p.\u000a    Kent, the key researcher on this project, was appointed to a lectureship\u000a      in Spanish at the\u000a      University of Chester in September 2012, at which point he continued to\u000a      pursue further research\u000a      into documentary photography and psychogeography (2 September 2012-31 July\u000a      2013). This\u000a      resulted in the publication of \"Walker Evans's Psychogeographic Mapping of\u000a      Havana, 1933\"\u000a      (History of Photography, 37:3), which served as the point of\u000a      departure for the Memories of a Lost\u000a        Shark project, and he has since gone on to explore new ground with\u000a      his practice-led research\u000a      regarding the psychogeographical experience of Havana. Moreover, as has\u000a      been pointed out by\u000a      other researchers and practitioners, this historical conjuncture is\u000a      conducive to breaking the\u000a      Revolution-fixated prism through which practically all research in this\u000a      country has been carried out\u000a      to date.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21147","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2395170","Name":"Benin"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2245662","Name":"Senegal"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context: The key researcher's extensive periods of fieldwork in\u000a      Francophone Africa, her research career in Francophone African development\u000a      studies and more latterly in the history of slavery in the region,\u000a      combined with her technical and theoretical knowledge of visual cultures,\u000a      provide a unique academic platform on which to engage with contemporary\u000a      artistic practice, interpret the development discourses in Francophone\u000a      African visual cultures and present these to professional and public\u000a      audiences.\u000a    Impact has taken place in a variety of forms including public lectures,\u000a      workshops, interviews, cultural festivals, consultancies, contributions to\u000a      exhibition design and the presentation of African visual perspectives in\u000a      public exhibitions.\u000a    By engaging with professionals and interpreting cultural products and\u000a      practices for audiences external to the academy, Griffiths is helping to\u000a      shape professional and public understanding of Francophone African art. In\u000a      essence, the impact aims at bringing African experiences of development to\u000a      a new public across continents, while simultaneously benefitting\u000a      professional practice in the creative and development industries.\u000a    Collaboration beyond the academy: Since 2010, the project has\u000a      focused on an increasing number of Francophone African artists as the\u000a      engagement with development and its representation through an iconography\u000a      of slavery has become more widespread. Three of these artists, Viya Dib&#233;\u000a      from Senegal, P&#233;lagie Gbaguidi from Benin; and Moridja Kitenge from the\u000a      Democratic Republic of the Congo, have provided original material for the\u000a      project. As a practitioner and academic, Viya Dib&#233; has contributed in\u000a      interviews, follow-up discussions and exchanges between June 2008 and June\u000a      2010 to framing the project in an African visual context. New work for\u000a      inclusion in the research project's public outputs (Kitenge and Gbaguidi)\u000a      has enriched the evidence base used to illustrate and explain the\u000a      conceptualisation of progress and development across different cultures\u000a      and economic worlds. Drawing on the researcher's historiographical\u000a      expertise to interpret and contexualise development in relation to\u000a      cultural practice, the participating artists have experienced the impact\u000a      in their own professional practice (Kitenge and Gbaguidi). The works of\u000a      five further artists (Romuald Hazoum&#233;, Julien Sinzogan, Barth&#233;l&#233;my Toguo,\u000a      Jems Robert Kokobi, Guy Wouat&#233;) are included in the public talks and\u000a      dissemination events providing a wider representation of how images of\u000a      slavery are entering the contemporary artistic vocabulary in West Africa.\u000a      Discussions on the themes and objectives of the project have been\u000a      conducted with the UK agent for these artists. Kitenge produced the\u000a      illustration for the public poster produced by the Spanish national centre\u000a      for modern art (see title of project above) to advertise Griffiths' public\u000a      lecture in Las Palmas, Spain, in June 2013.\u000a    Impact on Public awareness: The impact from this project has been\u000a      disseminated to non-academic audiences and professionals (artists,\u000a      curators, critics) in the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Senegal and Spain.\u000a      A series of exchanges and events has enabled public and professional\u000a      stakeholders to develop a better understanding of the role of art in\u000a      Francophone African society, and has facilitated the interpretation of\u000a      creative practice for new audiences beyond the academy. This knowledge\u000a      serves to reveal, both in Africa and beyond, what Francophone African art\u000a      can teach us about development in the continent. By communicating academic\u000a      research on African development issues in the public art gallery through\u000a      the medium of painting, the research is raising public awareness among new\u000a      audiences of the problems facing societies living in the world's most\u000a      disadvantaged region.

The research project originated in Griffiths' doctoral and\u000a      post-doctoral research on the French legacy in Africa and subsequently\u000a      more specifically on development policy and gender in postcolonial\u000a      Francophone Africa. The research has been conducted from September 2009\u000a      and includes impact up to 31 July 2013.\u000a    Underpinning research: Griffiths' recent monograph, Globalizing\u000a        the Postcolony, 2010, based on extensive fieldwork in West Africa,\u000a      developed a new multi-methodological approach to learning how development\u000a      policy is formulated, implemented and then experienced on the ground in\u000a      Francophone Africa. The research methodology and findings, described as\u000a      ground-breaking in the field, are applied in the current project. In this\u000a      impact case study project the focus extends from gender in development to\u000a      development in general in the region. The opportunity for impact from this\u000a      research lies in the academic expertise of the key researcher in systems\u000a      of historical and contemporary slavery in Francophone Africa, combined\u000a      with specialist knowledge of development policy in the region and the\u000a      analysis of visual culture. This expertise is operating at an interface\u000a      with contemporary professional and creative practice. The interaction and\u000a      collaboration is supporting emerging cultural practices representing\u000a      development in an iconography of slavery, and providing new insights into\u000a      this view of development in and from Africa.\u000a    Research insights and findings: National and regional development\u000a      policy in Francophone West Africa has been broadly modelled throughout the\u000a      postcolonial era on social and economic development templates imported\u000a      from non-African industrialised countries. The research has revealed how\u000a      these models of development are not universally endorsed in the locality\u000a      or effectively implemented. Increasingly they are being contested from\u000a      sites outside the formal political arena. Analytical and critical\u000a      engagement with the dominant development discourse of the region is being\u000a      articulated in a range of cultural outputs (film, literature, poetry,\u000a      dance, fine art, etc.). This project is currently looking at one area of\u000a      cultural production, contemporary works of art (les arts plastiques),\u000a      to reveal to a broader audience across the world how visual artists\u000a      interpret contemporary development in Francophone Africa and communicate\u000a      this in their artistic practice.\u000a    The underpinning research has, from its inception, been based in what is\u000a      historically the most economically-disadvantaged region of the world where\u000a      the role of development policy is critical to improving the welfare of\u000a      populations in the region. Indeed traditionally, and theoretically,\u000a      development is seen as a progressive series of actions towards something\u000a      better.\u000a    What this project is revealing is that a growing number of visual artists\u000a      are expressing `development' in this region, and in this era of global\u000a      markets, as not simply failing to bring `progress' but, worse, they\u000a      suggest the region is witnessing a return to practices endemic in earlier\u000a      international economic systems.\u000a    As the project reveals, an increasing number of artists are now\u000a      representing `development' in Francophone West Africa using depictions\u000a      deeply shocking to Western eyes. Images of the Slave Trade are reappearing\u000a      in 21st century art work originating from Benin, the region of\u000a      Africa that formed the epicentre of the transatlantic commerce in African\u000a      slaves during the final two centuries of the `terrible trade', and is\u000a      extending across the countries that make up Francophone Africa. The iconic\u000a      image of the infamous British slave ship, the Brookes (1789),\u000a      forms the centrepiece of this growing iconography (see Moridja Kitenge's\u000a      illustration above for the gallery talk at the Spanish national centre of\u000a      modern art in June 2013), reflecting a complex analytical engagement with\u000a      the history of Europe in Africa and its legacy in modern West Africa.\u000a    Theoretical underpinnings: Explanations of why change and\u000a      modernisation do not automatically equate to progress in this region are\u000a      formulated and theorised in the monograph Globalizing the Postcolony\u000a      (reference below). By demonstrating how gender policy has been implemented\u000a      in Francophone Africa throughout fifty years of postcolonial rule, it\u000a      reveals that theoretical configurations of `development' - and how gender\u000a      impacts on the policies and practices of development - are drawn directly\u000a      from post-industrial models with origins in exogenous cultures. It goes on\u000a      to uncover the how an absence of cultural adaptation with regard to these\u000a      exogenously-inspired policies plays out `on the ground'. The evidence\u000a      presented shows how and to what extent policy aimed at improving the\u000a      welfare of the female population of the region has both failed and even\u000a      undermined the relative position of women in relation to men. The research\u000a      findings provide a theoretical and pragmatic explanation of this failure\u000a      in terms of the cultural distance that separates those who are formulating\u000a      and funding policy for `development' in the region, and those who are\u000a      experiencing the impact of those policies, namely the weakest and most\u000a      disadvantaged members of societies located in the most economically\u000a      vulnerable and under-developed region of the world.\u000a    Methodological advances: The underpinning research provides a new\u000a      framework in which to evaluate `development' but also flags up the need to\u000a      map emerging discourses of development as they are experienced and\u000a      expressed outside of the formal structures of the State and international\u000a      development communities. Just as Globalizing the Postcolony was\u000a      the result of interactions over ten years between the key researcher and\u000a      stakeholders across the region (government ministers, national agencies,\u000a      international development workers, as well as target groups), this project\u000a      is formed by research methodology that provides a space for communication\u000a      across traditional divides that separate academic research from\u000a      professional practice. Visions of Development and Slavery in\u000a        Contemporary Francophone African Art provides an interactive space\u000a      within which those working in this area of the creative industries in\u000a      Francophone sub-Saharan Africa can engage with academic research to\u000a      explore, critique and continue to represent `development' in their region\u000a      through art practice. By interacting with that practice the project brings\u000a      new ways of thinking about development in Africa to multiple audiences\u000a      within and beyond the continent.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24005","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    When the Confucius Institute for Scotland opened in 2007, awareness of\u000a      China among the general\u000a      public and stakeholders in Scotland's educational and cultural sectors was\u000a      limited and there was\u000a      also limited infrastructure to support cultural exchange in place.\u000a    The transcultural knowledge transfer research focus of both Gentz and\u000a      Ward has directly\u000a      underpinned significant advances in addressing both problems of\u000a      infrastructure and the previous\u000a      lack of awareness. An important collaboration was brokered in 2007 between\u000a      the University of\u000a      Edinburgh (UoE)\/CIS and the Beijing Film Academy (BFA) by Gentz, entitled\u000a      `Cinema China 2007'.\u000a      Impact has been built from this starting point during the census period.\u000a    During the census period, the CIS organised more than 300 China-related\u000a      public events (see\u000a      http:\/\/www.confuciusinstitute.ac.uk\/events\/) that had an\u000a      impact on business, education, culture and\u000a      politics in Scotland. The success of these events was mainly based on the\u000a      China-expertise of N\u000a      Gentz acquired by her research on Chinese Cultural Studies. Below, four\u000a      examples of the wide\u000a      range of activities of the CIS are given to point out the specific\u000a      relationship between research and\u000a      impact in these particular events.\u000a    In 2008, organised by Gentz and rooted in her research on transcultural\u000a      knowledge transfer as\u000a      well as Ward's insights on Chinese film, CIS coordinated and marketed the\u000a      `China Now in\u000a      Scotland' festival. This comprised over 150 events involving more than 25\u000a      organisations across\u000a      Scotland from business, education, the arts, science and sport, ranging\u000a      from Aberdeen City\u000a      Council to the Scottish Arts Council (1). A member of the House of Lords,\u000a      a Patron of the Festival,\u000a      said: `The Institute's ability to unify the diverse efforts of various\u000a      programme partners, coupled with\u000a      the impact of the major events they ran, ensured that not only was a\u000a      substantial and diverse\u000a      audience reached, but several significant sustainable relationships were\u000a      also established' (2). A\u000a      former deputy leader of the Labour Party, commenting on the business\u000a      panel, stated: `The level of\u000a      interest and diversity of businesses at the China Expert Panel was\u000a      impressive. The Institute had\u000a      clearly tapped into the SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) sector and\u000a      stimulated them to\u000a      consider evolving a plan for engagement with China. It was a most\u000a      worthwhile evening' (3).\u000a    In 2008 Gentz secured an agreement with Guandong Museum of Art to bring a\u000a      substantial\u000a      photographic exhibition to Edinburgh's City Art Centre for 10 weeks. This\u000a      was `China: a\u000a      Photographic Portrait', and it featured more than 600 images dating from\u000a      1951 to 2003. The\u000a        Scotsman (4 July 2008) commented: `Modern China is a place of\u000a      immense wealth and absolute\u000a      poverty, a fact which has been captured beautifully by this massive,\u000a      enthralling exhibition of\u000a      hundreds of photographs' (4).\u000a    Comments from members of the public included:\u000a    \u000a      `Enlightening and very moving. Best photographic exhibition I have\u000a        ever seen';\u000a      `Gave me a feeling how China is like before I go there. Enjoyable!';\u000a      `Excellent... makes people think...';\u000a      `Phenomenal, moving' (5).\u000a    \u000a    Building on these successes, Gentz facilitated the securing of contracts\u000a      with the National Academy\u000a      of Education Administration, China from 2008-2011. In 2009, 25 senior\u000a      staff from leading Chinese\u000a      universities attended a week-long CIS-organised university leadership\u000a      programme in Edinburgh.\u000a    An Associate Professor at the NAEA commented: `We were delighted to take\u000a      part in this exchange\u000a      between China and Scotland. The programme gave us many ideas to take back\u000a      to our institutions\u000a      in China' (6). Further groups visited in 2011 and 2012.\u000a    That same research underpinned cultural links facilitated with Scottish\u000a      schools. CIS organised the\u000a      September 2012 visit of members of Peking University's Chinese Music\u000a      Institute to 700 pupils in 5\u000a      secondary and 7 primary schools. 70 pupils from three of these joined the\u000a      orchestra to play\u000a      melodies on metallophones and to sing in Mandarin Chinese. The Music\u000a      Coordinator for Fife\u000a      Council commented: `It's hard to credit the impact of this project on the\u000a      children and young people\u000a      involved and memories of the event will, I am sure, stay with them all for\u000a      many years to come. To\u000a      foster such warm and positive relations between young people from both\u000a      countries is a marvellous\u000a      thing' (7).\u000a    The Scottish Government is known to be supportive of the work of the CIS,\u000a      both as a catalyst and\u000a      facilitator for the sector, which it says helps to create a vibrant\u000a      landscape of cross cultural\u000a      engagement between Scotland and China (8).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The pioneering research of Professor N Gentz and Dr J Ward into\u000a      cross-cultural engagement and\u000a      of Dr J Ward on Chinese film has been the basis for a series of\u000a      ground-breaking educational and\u000a      cultural collaborations between China and Scotland organised by\u000a      Edinburgh's Confucius Institute\u000a      for Scotland (CIS). These significantly enhanced the understandings of\u000a      China held both by the\u000a      public at large and by stakeholders across Scotland's business, cultural\u000a      and educational sectors.\u000a      Work on cross-cultural engagement through film and photography operated as\u000a      a particular trigger\u000a      for these increased exchanges on a range of matters between China and\u000a      Scotland.

A\u000d\u000a      consultation by the then Lothian and Borders Police revealed that many\u000d\u000a      officers felt ignorant of Muslim beliefs and culture and therefore nervous\u000d\u000a      about their interactions with Scotland's Muslim communities. Alwaleed was\u000d\u000a      approached to organise continuing professional development training. Five\u000d\u000a      sessions were organised over five months. Four of the sessions were based\u000d\u000a      on the research of Unit 27 colleagues (1).\u000d\u000a    Pierret led officers through the key contemporary Islamic movements and\u000d\u000a      sectarian divisions within Islam. His session equipped officers with a\u000d\u000a      greater understanding of violent and non-violent tendencies within Islam\u000d\u000a      and the extent to which all affect the UK. Gorman explored the Arab World\u000d\u000a      in the 20th Century, offering key insights into the events\u000d\u000a      leading to the `Arab Spring'. Gorman encouraged officers to consider the\u000d\u000a      significance of these events for the global Muslim community and the UK.\u000d\u000a      Peace guided officers through the history of Islam in Scotland. He\u000d\u000a      provided practical understanding of the demographics of Scotland's Muslims\u000d\u000a      and of the influence of culture on community structures and behavioural\u000d\u000a      norms.\u000d\u000a    Nearly 70 officers from the then Lothian and Borders, Strathclyde and\u000d\u000a      Grampian forces attended each session. These included high-ranking\u000d\u000a      officers (chief superintendents and inspectors) and junior officers with\u000d\u000a      community policing responsibilities. An official of the then Lothian and\u000d\u000a      Borders Diversity Unit, said:\u000d\u000a    `This was a unique opportunity for our officers to hear from experts in\u000d\u000a      the field of Islamic studies. Feedback from officers has been extremely\u000d\u000a      positive and the knowledge gained from the lectures will doubtless help\u000d\u000a      our officers understand more about the Muslim communities they encounter\u000d\u000a      and serve' (2).\u000d\u000a    The impact of the sessions was acknowledged by a then senior Central\u000d\u000a      Scotland Police official who went on to request further input from\u000d\u000a      Alwaleed as a member of the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland\u000d\u000a      (ACPOS) Religion and Belief Reference Group (3). The group promotes\u000d\u000a      engagement between the Scottish Police Service and Scotland's faith\u000d\u000a      communities.\u000d\u000a    IMES academic staff were also invited to quality-assure the \"Diversity\u000d\u000a      Booklet\" to be distributed to every officer in Scotland (currently 17,500)\u000d\u000a      in August 2013 (delayed from early 2013 by the reorganisation of police\u000d\u000a      forces in Scotland). The booklet offers practical advice on policing\u000d\u000a      minority communities. Goddard, Peace and Pierret made `essential'\u000d\u000a      contributions to the chapter on Islam (pp.32-37), emphasising key\u000d\u000a      sectarian concerns and cultural nuances. The quality assurance process was\u000d\u000a      undertaken in March 2013 (4).\u000d\u000a    Breaking Barriers (November 2011 &#8212; present)\u000d\u000a    Breaking Barriers was a two-day residential conference organised\u000d\u000a      by Alwaleed in partnership with the Church of Scotland. Based on Goddard's\u000d\u000a      research on the historical and contemporary collaborations and disputes\u000d\u000a      between Christians and Muslims, Breaking Barriers brought together\u000d\u000a      22 young Christians and Muslims for discussions, lectures and workshops\u000d\u000a      exploring Christian\/Muslim relations and mutual misperceptions. Goddard\u000d\u000a      led 3 sessions, focussing on, and encouraging participants to engage with,\u000d\u000a      such concepts as the Holy Trinity, Jihad, and Sharia law and the\u000d\u000a      historical relationship between the two traditions.\u000d\u000a    Delegates included the head of the `Brothers' Circle' in Edinburgh (a\u000d\u000a      Muslim organisation with a membership of more than 200 young men), the\u000d\u000a      head of `Beyond the Veil' Muslim Women's Group (a support and advocacy\u000d\u000a      group for Muslim women in Scotland with a membership of more than 50), two\u000d\u000a      trainee Church of Scotland Ministers and the editor of Fifteen-21,\u000d\u000a      the UK's fastest-growing magazine for young Muslims with an online\u000d\u000a      readership in excess of 20,000 (5).\u000d\u000a    The conference had a profound impact on delegates, providing them with\u000d\u000a      key knowledge to apply to their life and work. (6) In an article written\u000d\u000a      for the Edinburgh Inter-Faith Association's quarterly magazine, a\u000d\u000a      Christian delegate said: `Of all the interfaith experiences I have had, Breaking\u000a        Barriers is one of the most inspiring. The participants all have\u000d\u000a      strong religious convictions, and when we get together, we do not\u000d\u000a      downplay, deny, or ignore our differences. Instead, we try to understand\u000d\u000a      each other's beliefs and practices, and make sure that we do not promote\u000d\u000a      inaccurate stereotypes.' (7).\u000d\u000a    The Breaking Barriers conference inspired the 14 Edinburgh-based\u000d\u000a      delegates to establish a discussion group for young Edinburgh-based\u000d\u000a      Christians and Muslims (8). The group met six times between January 2012\u000d\u000a      and February 2013. A second day-long Breaking Barriers conference will\u000d\u000a      take place in November 2013.\u000d\u000a    As a result of the success of the conference, the Edinburgh Inter-Faith\u000d\u000a      Association &#8212; founded in 1989 and comprising the capital's 10 faith\u000d\u000a      communities (http:\/\/www.eifa.org.uk\/membership\/)\u000d\u000a      &#8212; committed to funding a second Breaking Barriers conference in\u000d\u000a      November 2013 (7, 9) to be delivered in partnership with Alwaleed.

In particular, her award-winning\u000d\u000a      research into Islamic and Arab history, especially on the legacy of the\u000d\u000a      Crusades, provided the backdrop to all the Alwaleed work. Drawing on her\u000d\u000a      research, Hillenbrand developed the proposal that secured the &#163;8m\u000d\u000a      endowment from the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation to establish the Centre\u000d\u000a      at the University (2008). Hillenbrand's proposal envisioned a centre that\u000d\u000a      fostered a more profound understanding between the Muslim World and the\u000d\u000a      West via the twin paths of effective outreach and high quality research.\u000d\u000a      With Hillenbrand serving as chair of the Advisory Board, the Centre has\u000d\u000a      developed in accordance with this model.

With over half of planet's population now considering themselves to\u000d\u000a      be either Christian or Muslim, understanding the relationship, past and\u000d\u000a      present, between the world's two largest faith communities is of paramount\u000d\u000a      importance. Since his arrival in Edinburgh Goddard has published a series\u000d\u000a      of articles exploring Christian\/Muslim relations and the relationship\u000d\u000a      between the Muslim World and the West, in both historical and contemporary\u000d\u000a      contexts, in the process examining areas of tension between Christians and\u000d\u000a      Muslims but also highlighting areas of mutual cooperation and\u000d\u000a      understanding. The research of Dr Timothy Peace (appointed 2011, Alwaleed\u000d\u000a      Postdoctoral Fellow) focuses on Muslims in Britain. Peace's research\u000d\u000a      challenges the common tendency to homogenise Muslims in Britain, an\u000d\u000a      approach that assumes that all Muslims engage with the state and society\u000d\u000a      primarily as `Muslims' rather than as British citizens. Based on his\u000d\u000a      research Peace also teaches a unique course on the history of Muslims in\u000d\u000a      Britain. Since his arrival in Edinburgh, Peace has published book chapters\u000d\u000a      and articles exploring Muslim engagement with the political process in the\u000d\u000a      UK.\u000d\u000a    IMES colleagues included Dr Anthony Gorman (Senior Lecturer, appointed\u000d\u000a      2006).

Indicative of `ripple\u000a      effects', the workshop participant (1)\u000a      was motivated to run a translation workshop for twelve Egyptian\u000a      journalists and editors at the\u000a      independent Cairo newspaper al-Masri al-yawm\/Egypt Independent,\u000a      soliciting Booth's suggestions\u000a      on running it.

Booth\u000a      (Professor, appointed, 2009)\u000a      has undertaken a wide range of translation and related research\u000a      activities. Peer-reviewed articles\u000a      theorize her experience as a feminist translator in order to promote a\u000a      broader understanding of\u000a      how literary translations from the global South are written, edited,\u000a      disseminated and read in the\u000a      highly commercialised and competitive Euro\/American publishing sectors.\u000a      Key findings include\u000a      highlighting the importance of using translation of language in order to\u000a      `translate' culture in such a\u000a      way as to avoid exoticism. One outcome of the confrontation with the\u000a      `western' publishing sector is\u000a      to highlight the significance of the veiled female body. In line with the\u000a      challenge of humanizing the\u000a      cultural Other, one task for translators is that of resisting a symbolic\u000a      homogenisation of complex\u000a      societies through the figure of the veiled woman.\u000a    Any good translation both requires and constitutes research. The\u000a      relationship between translations\u000a      and other related research activities is iterative. Because of her work as\u000a      an award-winning\u000a      translator (13 book length translations published to date and one in\u000a      press), Booth is listened to as\u000a      a researcher and sought as a trainer, while research and training feed\u000a      back into her translations,\u000a      research (e.g., Booth 2011) and public engagement work. Impact and\u000a      research, co-produced with\u000a      users, are intertwined processes. For example, Khoury\/Booth 2012 (As\u000a        Though She Were\u000a        Sleeping) required intensive research into the language of Greek\u000a      Orthodox Lebanese in the 1940s,\u000a      particularly amongst women, and that language is woven into the\u000a      translation through carefully\u000a      contextualized use of Arabic and Greek terms, producing more intimate\u000a      cultural awareness\u000a      amongst readers of what lies behind the language.\u000a    Booth also studies commercial publishing processes and political\u000a      interests and how they constrain\u000a      translators' agency. She argues, for example (2010), that translations of\u000a      works by authors defined\u000a      as `Muslim women' are framed by publicity materials drawing on narrow\u000a      cultural assumptions that\u000a      `freeze' complexity. This demands that translators counter such\u000a      stereotyping. Booth encourages\u000a      deliberate strategies of translation, publicity-formation and negotiation\u000a      with editors, whether by\u000a      mentoring individual translators, speaking to publishers and readers, or\u000a      leading workshops on the\u000a      dynamics of translating specific texts. Booth's research demonstrates that\u000a      one must shake up the\u000a      processes of text production, from choice of text to phrasing and\u000a      publicity framing.\u000a    Booth's on-going field-based research assessing translator-author\u000a      negotiations in producing\u000a      literary translations from Arabic into European languages finds that\u000a      relationships between\u000a      translators, authors and publishers vary; they are especially problematic\u000a      when involving less-experienced\u000a      translators and\/or emerging authors. This variable power affects\u000a      translators' abilities\u000a      to control finished products. When authors are marketed as `stars',\u000a      translators have less autonomy\u000a      as labourers. The resulting translations diminish readers' ability to\u000a      acquire nuanced knowledge of\u000a      Arab societies (and their gender dynamics), and are often less forceful as\u000a      literary works than they\u000a      might be (Booth 2010).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24410","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Evans' work on gender in China has been disseminated through diverse\u000a      outlets including frequent BBC radio programmes and TV interviews, blog\u000a      postings, women's organizations in China, workshops and meetings with\u000a      NGOs, activists and corporate personnel (Deloitte's and Flamingo London),\u000a      and consultancy with charitable organizations and legal practices.

Hird and\u000a      Evans held a highly successful gender training workshop as the first of a\u000a      series of workshops with UK based NGOs working on and in China (2011). The\u000a      impact of these activities has been to change attitudes about the\u000a      significance of gender in social and political campaign work; open up\u000a      debate in China about gender identities in same-sex and heterosexual\u000a      contexts, and explore new avenues for advertising campaigns, specifically\u000a      with Ogilvy and Mather's Volkswagen Team. Following Hird's visit to Ogilvy\u000a      and Mather, the Account Director of Ogilvy One Worldwide, Beijing, a\u000a      participant of Hird's workshop, wrote that \"During the past few weeks the\u000a      team has worked on a creative direction and idea that was initiated and\u000a      stimulated by the workshop....The topic, the agenda, the breadth and depth\u000a      chosen for the workshop has been ideal for us and we would be looking\u000a      forward to any similar initiative if planned in the future.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Evans' internationally acclaimed research on gender and sexuality in\u000a      China has had significant impact on critical debate, heightening public\u000a      awareness of gender as a key marker of social difference and hierarchy,\u000a      and encouraging diverse professional organisations to address gender in\u000a      their work on China. Through radio broadcasts, television appearances and\u000a      web-based media, NGO and government consultancy, gender training workshops\u000a      and translation, Evans' work has influenced the thinking and practice of\u000a      representatives of international and Chinese NGOs working on women's\u000a      gender and sexual rights, and reproductive and sexual health.

Her\u000a      next book, The Subject of Gender: Daughters and Mothers in Urban China\u000a      (2008), many scholarly and non-academic publications, as well as Chinese,\u000a      Italian and French translations of her work confirmed her status as a\u000a      leading international scholar of women and gender in modern and\u000a      contemporary China. Evans' work has been widely acclaimed for its\u000a      influence on Chinese feminist thought, and has significantly contributed\u000a      to public as well as academic debates in China and the West about Chinese\u000a      women's lives and gender relationships.\u000a    Evans' research covers analysis of diverse materials going back to the\u000a      1920s, including educational, medical and popular publications, magazines\u000a      and journals, party and `mass organisation' documents, and long-term\u000a      ethnographically-based fieldwork with women in Beijing and elsewhere\u000a      (notably the rural northwest). Her main arguments in Women and\u000a        Sexuality in China were that i) official policies of gender equality\u000a      in social, political and cultural practice are sustained by naturalised\u000a      assumptions that identify the female body as a site of physical and\u000a      emotional vulnerability, responsiveness and weakness; ii) rehearsed in\u000a      scientific, educational and official texts, the `scientific' evidence of\u000a      women's physiological and emotional characteristics sustain hierarchical\u000a      social and cultural differences between women and men, and iii) the\u000a      possibilities of realising official policies of gender equality are\u000a      constrained by such assumptions as well as by cultural practices of\u000a      patrilineal inheritance and patriarchy. Her 2008 monograph added to this\u000a      work by arguing that across different generations, women's subjective and\u000a      shifting understandings of gender difference commonly subscribe to similar\u000a      discursive and cultural assumptions about the female body, and that\u000a      although gender practice in employment and education has changed radically\u000a      over the past half century, opportunities for gender equality in personal\u000a      and social relationships are pervasively mediated by embedded assumptions\u000a      about the limitations of women's bodies, emotions and minds.\u000a    Emerging out of his PhD work on white-collar masculinity in China, Hird's\u000a      research draws on long-term fieldwork in Beijing as well as analysis of\u000a      diverse print media and internet-based narratives. Although an early\u000a      career researcher, Hird has produced important articles and a monograph, Men\u000a        and Masculinities in Contemporary China, co-authored with Song Geng\u000a      (ANU), one of the world's leading scholars working on masculinity and\u000a      sexuality in China. Hird's work has been widely disseminated through\u000a      international conferences and workshops, and has led to many collaborative\u000a      initiatives with NGOs, LGBT and queer activists and advertising personnel.\u000a    Hird's main arguments are that i) the figure of the `white-collar' man is\u000a      widely associated with the success of China's economic transformation; ii)\u000a      the gender characteristics of the `white-collar' man are rooted in local\u000a      cultural as well as global notions of gender difference; iii) such gender\u000a      characteristics grant men cultural, social and sexual privileges in\u000a      public, professional and domestic contexts, and iv) views of male\u000a      privilege are profoundly influential in the education of young children\u000a      and in popular media discussions about how to be a successful man. These\u000a      arguments constitute a highly original contribution to debates about\u000a      gender and sexuality in China.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24506","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Evans' research on visual culture, history and heritage of Mao's China\u000d\u000a      has long engaged with non-academic audiences including curators,\u000d\u000a      journalists, film-makers, art practitioners, school teachers and children\u000d\u000a      and the general public in order to i) use Mao era visual culture, and\u000d\u000a      specifically posters, as a public space for critical debate about Mao's\u000d\u000a      China; ii) work with gallery curators and artists to develop projects to\u000d\u000a      facilitate the dissemination of such debate amongst the general public;\u000d\u000a      iii) liaise with school teachers in the UK, and particularly London, to\u000d\u000a      use Westminster's Chinese Poster Collection as a resource for the teaching\u000d\u000a      of modern and contemporary China.

Evans has given\u000d\u000a      numerous public lectures, conference and seminar papers on Mao era posters\u000d\u000a      in the UK\/EU, USA, Australia and China. Many of these have focused on\u000d\u000a      women and gender, and have included materials from extended interviews\u000d\u000a      with Chinese poster artists and collectors of the 1960s and 1970s, notably\u000d\u000a      from Guangzhou and Shanghai. A paper drawing on this research is included\u000d\u000a      in Jie Li ed. China's Red Legacy (Harvard University Press,\u000d\u000a      forthcoming).\u000d\u000a    Evans' research on Mao era visual culture has benefited from her\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Stephanie Helemryk Donald, initially when the latter\u000d\u000a      was Research Fellow at the University of Westminster (1997), and since\u000d\u000a      then when Donald visited Westminster as Visiting Research Fellow (2008 and\u000d\u000a      2010). Evans' work in this field has been further enriched by her close\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Hu Jie and Ai Xiaoming, two of China's most widely\u000d\u000a      acclaimed independent documentary film makers. Evans invited Hu and Ai in\u000d\u000a      2005 and 2006 respectively to join her as Visiting Research Fellows to\u000d\u000a      explore Westminster's Chinese Poster Collection as a repository of\u000d\u000a      contradictory memories and narratives of Mao's China. Their collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Evans produced two widely disseminated documentary films, `Painting\u000d\u000a      for the Revolution: Peasant Paintings from Hu County, China' (2007) and\u000d\u000a      `Red Art' (2007) each of which involved extensive interviews and\u000d\u000a      ethnographically based research in China and the UK.\u000d\u000a    Evans' work on posters and visual culture of the Mao era argues that i)\u000d\u000a      the poster is a powerful, though overlooked, visual tool depicting\u000d\u000a      hierarchies of age, gender and ethnicity and social and political status\u000d\u000a      that are commonly missing from retrospective accounts of the period; ii)\u000d\u000a      posters' continuing appeal to diverse audiences across national boundaries\u000d\u000a      produces narratives of the Mao's China that both add to and challenge\u000d\u000a      mainstream accounts of the period; iii) looking at posters can elicit\u000d\u000a      memories of past experiences denied public discussion in China, and the\u000d\u000a      public display of posters in exhibitions gives a public legitimacy to such\u000d\u000a      experiences in accounts of China's recent history; iv) such public display\u000d\u000a      has particular significance for post-1989 transnational migration cohorts;\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24692","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Framing Muslims has greatly informed the work of individuals and\u000d\u000a      organisations who actively\u000d\u000a      challenge negative perceptions of Muslims and Muslim communities in the UK\u000d\u000a      (1, below).\u000d\u000a      Specifically, the book has been used to inform the work of ENGAGE, a\u000d\u000a      not-for-profit company\u000d\u000a      founded in 2008 with the aim of challenging Islamophobia in the UK and\u000d\u000a      improving Muslim\u000d\u000a      participation in media and politics. In November 2012, ENGAGE launched a\u000d\u000a      national touring\u000d\u000a      exhibition, Media Portrayals of Islam and Muslims, at the House of\u000d\u000a      Commons to generate\u000d\u000a      awareness and understanding of Islamophobia and its impact on the lives\u000d\u000a      and security of British\u000d\u000a      Muslims. The findings of Framing Muslims formed part of the\u000d\u000a      exhibition and its accompanying\u000d\u000a      guide, providing in-depth analysis of what constitutes `newsworthy'\u000d\u000a      articles when selecting stories\u000d\u000a      about Muslims or Islam and how pre-determined patterns of selection\u000d\u000a      reinforce negative\u000d\u000a      stereotypes. The exhibition was mounted in multiple locations in the UK,\u000d\u000a      including the Muslim\u000d\u000a      Council for Britain's community dinners in Birmingham and Leicester (200\u000d\u000a      attendees per event);\u000d\u000a      Social Workers Action Network conference, South Bank University (500+);\u000d\u000a      the Unite Against\u000d\u000a      Fascism Conference, London (500+); Communications Workers Union\u000d\u000a      headquarters, London\u000d\u000a      (200); Manchester Museum (2000+); and London Muslim Centre and East London\u000d\u000a      Mosque (200+).\u000d\u000a    Framing Muslims also heavily informed ENGAGE's media masterclass,\u000d\u000a      a free one-day course held\u000d\u000a      in London (2012) and Bolton (2013), which encouraged delegates to think\u000d\u000a      critically about the\u000d\u000a      negative portrayal of Muslims in the media and how this might be\u000d\u000a      challenged in the quest for a\u000d\u000a      more cohesive and inclusive society. Shenaz Bunglawala, ENGAGE's Head of\u000d\u000a      Research, confirms\u000d\u000a      the contribution to both the masterclass and the exhibition (2, 3 and 4):\u000d\u000a    \"The book's analysis of the representation of Muslims in film and\u000d\u000a        literature is used to illustrate the\u000d\u000a        stereotypes that pervade in this medium. Framing Muslims is\u000d\u000a        uniquely relevant for its inclusion of\u000d\u000a        `soft' media approaches, that is, the prevalence of anti-Muslim\u000d\u000a        stereotypes in literature and film.\u000d\u000a        This analysis contributes to assessment on the representation of Islam\u000d\u000a        and Muslims in `hard'\u000d\u000a        media (newspapers and television) and aids in the appreciation of how\u000d\u000a        multi-platform messaging\u000d\u000a        informs the construction of Muslims and Islam in the public discourse.\u000d\u000a        Our media masterclass\u000d\u000a        presentation and Islamophobia Awareness Exhibition would not be complete\u000d\u000a        without inclusion of\u000d\u000a        the analysis contained in Framing Muslims and its significance\u000d\u000a        to challenging anti-Muslim prejudice\u000d\u000a        in public discourse\".\u000d\u000a    Framing Muslims has also informed the thinking of those within the\u000d\u000a      media involved in debates and\u000d\u000a      discussions surrounding the representation of Muslims. Samira Ahmed,\u000d\u000a      freelance journalist, writer\u000d\u000a      and broadcaster at the BBC, cites the text as having shaped her ideas on\u000d\u000a      this issue (5):\u000d\u000a    \"I found Dr Yaqin's book interesting and I've recommended it or\u000d\u000a        brought ideas from it up in\u000d\u000a        meetings and discussions with producers and guests in at Radio 3, the\u000d\u000a        World Service and BBC1.\u000d\u000a        For example, we did a programme item at Night Waves on Radio 3 a\u000d\u000a        few months ago about the\u000d\u000a        concept of Muslim comedy in North America, which drew on some similar\u000d\u000a        ideas (6).

My\u000d\u000a        producer read the book on my\u000d\u000a        recommendation, so it played a specific part in the preparation of ideas\u000d\u000a        and scope of the\u000d\u000a        programme. In that sense, the impact has been notable.\"\u000d\u000a    Yaqin (with Peter Morey) has actively disseminated her research through\u000d\u000a      media engagement and\u000d\u000a      participation in public events. In 2011, she appeared on the Islam\u000d\u000a      Channel's Politics and Media\u000d\u000a      show hosted by Salma Yaqoob (former leader of the Respect Party) to\u000d\u000a      discuss the book's findings\u000d\u000a      in relation the rise of the English Defence League and the lack of redress\u000d\u000a      for Islamophobia in\u000d\u000a      sections of the press (7). She also discussed the book's ideas at City\u000d\u000a      Circle London, the Centre for\u000d\u000a      the Study of Islam in the UK at Cardiff and the Muslim Institute Winter\u000d\u000a      Gathering in Sarum College,\u000d\u000a      Salisbury (8, 9).

The\u000d\u000a      book applies insights from\u000d\u000a      communications theory, semiotics and discourse analysis to reveal how\u000d\u000a      images of Muslims are\u000d\u000a      constructed and circulated. Yaqin's expertise in gender and\u000d\u000a      performativity, and her innovative\u000d\u000a      approach (drawing on sociology, cultural studies and literary theory), add\u000d\u000a      a unique perspective,\u000d\u000a      demonstrated most clearly in the final chapter, which focuses on gender,\u000d\u000a      comedy and subversion.\u000d\u000a    Framing Muslims contributes substantially to the study of the\u000d\u000a      representation of Muslims by\u000d\u000a      presenting a more holistic approach to understanding the issue of Muslim\u000d\u000a      representation in the\u000d\u000a      media, developing a context-sensitive critical framework which recognises\u000d\u000a      the subtlety and power\u000d\u000a      of images. Moreover, it offers recommendations for reflexive,\u000d\u000a      self-critical practices in politics and\u000d\u000a      the media to improve the representation of Muslims in these two spheres.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29891","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research has informed antislavery debate, policy and practice on the\u000a      part of 1) the European Parliament; 2) NGOs; 3) specific communities (of\u000a      teachers and lawyers).\u000a    Influencing the debates of the European Union\u000a      Trodd's research (reference 4) has had an impact on the\u000a      antislavery discourse of the European Union. She presented the findings of\u000a      her commissioned study (reference 4) to the European Parliament's\u000a      Subcommittee on Human Rights on July 10, 2013, then engaged in an exchange\u000a      of views with Myria Vassiliadou, the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. The\u000a      study assessed the EU's antislavery efforts so far and recommended new\u000a      courses of action, including an EU Directive on Transparency in Supply\u000a      Chains, national anti-slavery plans and slavery inspectorates for Member\u000a      States, a systematic regulation of labour recruitment agencies, a better\u000a      use of historic antislavery imagery in its own reports and resources\u000a      (rather than its current use of famous 19th-century icons like\u000a      the crouching, pleading slave from \"Am I Not a Man and a Brother\"), and\u000a      dozens of other recommendations centred around the suggestion that the EU\u000a      shift its focus from just trafficking (the process of enslavement)\u000a      to slavery itself, and do so with reference to earlier forms of slavery\u000a      and antislavery. In response, the Vice-Chair of the Subcommittee on Human\u000a      Rights, Metin Kazak, said he wanted to \"underline the message of the paper\u000a      that there is a clear recommendation to the EU to cease referring to\u000a      trafficking as slavery and rather recognise trafficking as a\u000a      method by which a minority of the world's slaves are brought to slavery\" (source\u000a        1). MEPs then debated the value of this proposed shift. Here Trodd\u000a      introduced a new element to the EU's debate on its approach to combatting\u000a      contemporary slavery and human trafficking. Other policy recommendations\u000a      have the potential for impact over the next two-three years.\u000a    Making suggestions to NGOs about elements of their abolitionism\u000a      Trodd presented research to antislavery NGOs about how best to translate\u000a      the lessons and methods of 19th-century abolitionism and\u000a      antislavery writing into 21st-century antislavery strategies\u000a      and campaigns. The NGOs with which Trodd engaged subsequently changed an\u000a      element of their approach. As well as her own research into antislavery\u000a      imagery and contemporary slave narratives (reference 3), she used\u000a      that of Ashworth (reference 2) to suggest that antislavery\u000a      organisations should support grassroots organisations that empower\u000a      enslaved people to take and sustain their own freedom, rather than\u000a      organisations that buy people out of slavery; and that of Newman (reference\u000a        1) to suggest that organisations should work to gather the\u000a      narratives of contemporary slaves, publish them without what Newman terms\u000a      the \"straitjacket\" of editorial interference and authenticating\u000a      testimonials by sponsors, and make the slave narrative as central to\u000a      contemporary abolitionism as it was to 19th-century antislavery\u000a      efforts.\u000a    \u000a      Free the Slaves (the leading American antislavery NGO) applied the\u000a        suggestions based on Trodd and Newman's research into slave narratives\u000a        by launching a digital collection of testimonies (source 2).\u000a      The Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives (FDFI) (a high-profile\u000a        antislavery NGO run by Frederick Douglass' direct descendants) applied\u000a        the advice based on Trodd's research into antislavery imagery in its\u000a        contributions to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History's\u000a        National Youth Summit on Abolition, held on February 11, 2013, and\u000a        attended by 4200 high school students and teachers from the U.S., Kenya,\u000a        Canada, Pakistan, Malta and Brazil onsite and online. The FDFI\u000a        president, Kenneth B. Morris (Douglass' great-great-great-grandson)\u000a        participated in the panel discussion and contributed material to the\u000a        summit's Conversation Kit, a document circulated a week in advance of\u000a        the event. Here he applied Trodd's suggestions, quoting her directly (source\u000a          3, p.8). Advice to The National Underground Railroad Freedom\u000a        Center (NURFC) (which is both a museum about the historic underground\u000a        railroad and a contemporary antislavery organization based in Ohio),\u000a        shaped its contributions to the same Summit, where it applied Trodd's\u000a        warning about sensationalising depictions of slavery, quoting her\u000a        directly (source 3, p.9).\u000a      John Brown Lives (JBL) (a human rights organisation based in upstate\u000a        New York) applied the suggestions based on Ashworth's research to\u000a        organize a public event in New York City in April 2013 where Trodd\u000a        discussed the potential value of the John Brown method (violent direct\u000a        action) and slave rebellion (central to Emancipation, as Ashworth has\u000a        argued), to today's antislavery efforts. In direct response to this\u000a        event and the awareness it raised, New York City declared April 7&#8212;the\u000a        day of the event&#8212;John Brown Day. A councilman proclaimed at the event\u000a        itself: \"whereas John Brown.... is a figure of particular importance in\u000a        American history who spent his life fighting against the endemic\u000a        injustice of slavery and.... whereas an important event in recognition\u000a        of the efforts of Mr Brown is promoting knowledge through academic\u000a        discourse and educated discussion; now, therefore, April 7 is John Brown\u000a        Day\" (source 4). Creating a John Brown Day in New York that\u000a        highlights contemporary slavery and the antislavery strategy of armed\u000a        resistance and slave rebellion has, according to the Executive Director\u000a        of JBL, \"engaged the communities of New York in the freedom history of\u000a        their region, promoted social justice and human rights, and encouraged\u000a        people to see who else is out there working on the question of human\u000a        equality today\" (source 5).\u000a\u000a    \u000a    Initiating the establishment of Britain's first antislavery taskforce\u000a      Following a lecture and seminar on contemporary slavery (based on research\u000a      in reference 4) that Trodd delivered in May 2013 to the Young\u000a      Public Lawyers Group (an industry-wide London-based network that\u000a      facilitates links between public lawyers and hosts events of interest to\u000a      this sector), the group (with Trodd as Advisor) established Britain's\u000a      first antislavery taskforce. The London-based taskforce is initially\u000a      comprised of lawyers and NGO representatives, and will also include\u000a      A&amp;E doctors, police, social workers and local government officials.\u000a      The task-force is training and planning for trafficking and slavery cases,\u000a      addressing and resolving areas of potential overlap or conflict, and\u000a      ensuring that open lines of communication exist. As shown in the U.S.,\u000a      where most major cities have such a group, local taskforces smooth the\u000a      movement of survivors to appropriate service providers, increase the\u000a      viability of prosecutions, and raise levels of public awareness and\u000a      vigilance.\u000a    Helping teachers promote antislavery awareness among students\u000a      Trodd drew primary material from her research (references 3-5) to\u000a      publish a collection of contemporary slave narratives online at the\u000a      Antislavery Literature Project (ALP)&#8212;an educational non-profit that\u000a      provides free access to the literature and history of the antislavery\u000a      movement (source 6). The collection was accessed 536,796 times (as\u000a      of July 2013), with 87,336 unique visits. A \"Contemporary Slavery\u000a      Teachers' Resource\" and accompanying website produced by the International\u000a      Slavery Museum with support from UNESCO used Trodd's narratives as the\u000a      basis for case studies (source 7) and was accessed 17,552 times\u000a      online by July 2013. The resource has been used by teachers to educate\u000a      students aged 10 to 14 in England and Wales on contemporary slavery as\u000a      part of their education in Citizenship. Trodd also adapted her\u000a      research (references 3-5) for numerous public talks, including in\u000a      Portland, New Haven and New York in March and April 2013; for a Youtube\u000a      lecture posted on February 27, 2013 that had reached 9200 views and 142\u000a      comments by July 2013 (source 8); and for two different 2-day\u000a      courses for 50 high-school teachers in Boston about contemporary slavery\u000a      in March and July 2013. The teachers went on to adapt the course content\u000a      for their own teaching (which reaches around 1200 students, with average\u000a      class sizes at 25 students). The teachers shared their reflections on the\u000a      course and also the lesson plans they had written and used as a result,\u000a      demonstrating the impact on their teaching (source 9). For\u000a      example, one teacher had asked her students to complete a project about\u000a      the products they use that are connected to slave labour, then asked the\u000a      students to write letters to newspapers about contemporary slavery.\u000a      Working with students rather than teachers, Trodd also adapted her\u000a      research (reference 5) for a Widening Participation session about\u000a      contemporary slavery offered to 30 high-achieving and low-income local\u000a      Year 12s in the Nottingham area (March 2013) and successfully supported\u000a      the pupils in developing new knowledge and understanding. Before the\u000a      session, questioning of students revealed they knew nothing about the\u000a      topic. In a follow-up survey a week later, all students were able to\u000a      explain important facts and figures about today's slavery (source 10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Zoe Trodd has contributed to changes in antislavery policy\u000a      debate and practice at local, national and international levels&#8212;from\u000a      lawyers' societies and school teachers, to national non-governmental\u000a      organisations (NGOs) and the European Parliament&#8212;through a series of\u000a      publications, consultations, public talks, and contributions to teaching\u000a      and digital resources about contemporary slavery and abolitionism.

John Ashworth's research,\u000a      undertaken as Professor of American History (2000-present), positions 19th-century\u000a      slave resistance as a key cause of the Civil War and a key factor in\u000a      slavery's abolition (reference 2). Both professors have therefore\u000a      traced specific antislavery strategies that Trodd has subsequently\u000a      presented to NGOs as a series of lessons that the 19th-century\u000a      abolitionist movement offers to 21st-century abolitionists.\u000a    In research undertaken and published as Professor of American Literature\u000a      (July 1, 2012-present), Trodd has written the most up-to-date assessment\u000a      available of contemporary slavery and antislavery efforts in Europe, with\u000a      recommendations for the European Union's future antislavery strategies, as\u000a      a 30-page commissioned study submitted in May 2013 and delivered as an\u000a      address at the European Parliament on July 10, 2013 (reference 4),\u000a      as well as comprehensive introductions to contemporary slavery and human\u000a      trafficking (reference 5). Since July 2012 she also has examined\u000a      the literary and visual culture of the 21st-century global\u000a      antislavery movement, a now 15-year-old movement to end the enslavement of\u000a      27 million people worldwide. For example, she has gathered and published\u000a      narratives by formerly enslaved people (source 4), then offered the\u000a      first and only scholarly theorisation of these narratives as a genre (the\u000a      Contemporary Slave Narrative) in a paper at a public international\u000a      conference in November 2012 that brought together academics and\u000a      antislavery activists before an audience of 200 that included Luis CdeBaca\u000a      (director of the U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat\u000a      Trafficking in Persons). Arguing that slave narratives need to be as\u000a      central to today's antislavery movement as they were to 19th-century\u000a      abolitionism, she has revealed former slaves making themselves subjects of\u000a      a story instead of objects for sale in their protest literature. In\u000a      addition, she has provided the first and only examination of contemporary\u000a      antislavery visual culture, in an open-access peer-reviewed journal\u000a      article in May 2013 (reference 3) that was featured by the\u000a      Education Outreach team at the Facebook page for the Department of Public\u000a      Information at the United Nations on June 15, 2013. Here Trodd identified\u000a      some of the same limitations of paternalism, dehumanisation and\u000a      sensationalism as dominated much of the first antislavery movement's\u000a      visual culture. Finally, the research thread that ties these multiple\u000a      elements together is Trodd's focus on what 19th-century\u000a      abolitionism has offered so far&#8212;and what more it could offer&#8212;to 21st-century\u000a      abolitionists. Across all this research, Trodd has argued that today's\u000a      abolitionists should learn lessons from the first antislavery movement's\u000a      failures, successes, contradictions and unfinished work. They should work\u000a      to replace nostalgia with protest memory&#8212;memory of protest and\u000a      memory used to protest&#8212;and salvage a literary and visual culture\u000a      of slave rebellion and black activism, rather than slave passivity and\u000a      white paternalism.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29892","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Jones' publications, research experience and background in the field of\u000a      nuclear history, Cold War diplomatic history, and the general area of\u000a      Anglo-American relations were central to his selection by the Cabinet\u000a      Office to be the official historian of the UK strategic nuclear deterrent\u000a      and the Chevaline (Polaris improvement) programme (see source 1\u000a      for Jones' formal appointment to this position by the Prime Minister).

It is apparent that the Ministry of\u000a      Defence has relatively little `institutional memory', and the official\u000a      history commissioned in 2008&#8212;with full access to the UK documentary\u000a      record&#8212;is intended to provide an authoritative account of the evolution of\u000a      UK strategic nuclear policy, in its full military, political, diplomatic,\u000a      and technical context, between the Nassau Conference of 1962, when it was\u000a      agreed that the Polaris missile system would be supplied to Britain, and\u000a      1982, when the Chevaline programme came to fruition with the first\u000a      deployment of an improved version of Polaris. Kept very secret throughout\u000a      the 1970s, Chevaline (a system designed to overcome Soviet anti-ballistic\u000a      missile defences) was a hugely controversial programme, notable for major\u000a      costs overruns, technical uncertainty, and delay. The history provides\u000a      full detail of this central episode in post-war UK defence policy so that\u000a      lessons learned from it can usefully inform future policy and strategy.\u000a    Expanding the knowledge base and historical context of policy-makers\u000a    Senior Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence officials have been aware\u000a      of the official history, and have been interested in exploring the\u000a      historical parallels and analogies that are thrown up in their current\u000a      areas of work from previous episodes in nuclear policymaking. At four\u000a      `learning from history' seminars, Jones debated and discussed some of the\u000a      issues raised by the Chevaline programme, as well by the study of UK\u000a      nuclear history in the Polaris era, including the origins, background, and\u000a      development of the Polaris improvement programme, and the historical\u000a      parallels to today. Two seminars were high-level events, involving a small\u000a      group of senior officials (15 November 2011 and 23 January 2012), and two\u000a      were for a wider audience of mid-range Ministry of Defence officials (24\u000a      November 2011 and 15 December 2011). Then on 20 November 2012, at the\u000a      express invitation of the Cabinet Office official leading the group that\u000a      is writing the Trident renewal alternatives paper for the Coalition\u000a      Government, Jones offered a briefing to officials engaged in this process,\u000a      and discussed issues connected with nuclear deterrence. On 29 November\u000a      2012 Jones led another session, this time with Treasury officials who were\u000a      particularly concerned with the cost overruns associated with the\u000a      Chevaline programme. Attendees at these briefings and seminars have\u000a      included the current Chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee (then\u000a      Second Permanent Secretary, MoD); Director-General Security Policy, MoD;\u000a      Chief Scientific Adviser MoD; Director of Strategic Technologies, MoD;\u000a      Assistant Chief of Defence Staff (CBRN&#8212;Chemical, Biological, Nuclear,\u000a      Radiological); head of CBRN Policy, MoD. An important indicator of impact\u000a      achieved has been the requests for further briefings coming from\u000a      officials, some of whom have attended more than one session.\u000a    One of the avowed aims of the Government's official history programme is\u000a      that it represents an opportunity for `learning from history', where\u000a      knowledge and findings regarding past episodes can be used to inform\u000a      consideration of current issues of policy. The seminars have\u000a      expanded the knowledge base and historical context of the decision-makers\u000a      involved in key decisions in the field of 21st-century British\u000a      defence and nuclear policy&#8212;involving the prospective expenditure of over\u000a      &#163;20 billion of public money during the period up to the late 2020s&#8212;as the\u000a      issue of Trident renewal comes to a head, and the role of an independent\u000a      nuclear deterrent is once more debated. In this context, the breadth and\u000a      depth of Jones' research (references 1-4) fulfils the role of\u000a      expert advice. It has been highly valued and sought-after by the senior\u000a      officials who make these decisions to allocate large amounts of public\u000a      money for a project that will inevitably receive high levels of public and\u000a      political scrutiny.

The publications are\u000a      the product of extensive archival research in the UK National Archives at\u000a      Kew, the US National Archives at College Park, Maryland, and US\u000a      presidential libraries. From 2008, as the official historian of the UK\u000a      nuclear deterrent and the Chevaline (Polaris improvement) programme, with\u000a      a base in the Cabinet Office, Jones carried out further research into the\u000a      most significant UK documentary sources (both open and closed material) on\u000a      British nuclear policy between the late 1950s and early 1980s.\u000a    In published work, Jones' study of US nuclear planning, nuclear\u000a      policymaking, and deterrence posture in the early Cold War period has\u000a      yielded key insights into the highly politicised nature of nuclear policy,\u000a      and the different factors bearing on the actions of decision-makers,\u000a      ranging from domestic political circumstances, the operational demands and\u000a      requirements of the armed forces, and the fragmented nature of large\u000a      government bureaucracies (references 1 and 4). He also has\u000a      analysed the Anglo-American nuclear relationship, where differences have\u000a      arisen over consultation about nuclear use, access to information on\u000a      nuclear planning, and the levels of assistance for the UK nuclear\u000a      programme. This offered grounding for understanding the dynamics of US-UK\u000a      cooperation over the Polaris programme in the 1960s and 1970s (a crucial\u000a      part of the official history) (reference 2). Research on the\u000a      nuclear policies of the Labour Government led by Harold Wilson from 1964\u000a      to 1970 has examined several tensions and debates, where the avowed policy\u000a      of `internationalising' the strategic nuclear deterrent (through such\u000a      steps as the creation of an Atlantic Nuclear Force, or deployment of\u000a      Polaris submarines east of Suez, where they could offer a nuclear\u000a      guarantee to India) conflicted with the attractions of maintaining an\u000a      `independent' nuclear force at a difficult time in European and NATO\u000a      Alliance affairs (reference 3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29893","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3378535","Name":"Guyana"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Dissemination of ideas\u000d\u000a      In order to better disseminate their research, Bernier and Lewthwaite have\u000d\u000a      worked to publically redefine the terms \"Black\" and \"Latino\". Bernier\u000d\u000a      discussed black stereotypes in the context of 19th-century\u000d\u000a      cultural depictions on Melvin Bragg's Radio 4 programme \"In Our Time\" (source\u000a        1), while Lewthwaite used her research on the relationship between\u000d\u000a      Latino culture and identity politics for a video lecture on the term\u000d\u000a      \"Latino,\" which received 8000 views between March and July 2013, and\u000d\u000a      prompted an online debate in which viewers reflected on their own\u000d\u000a      identities and the power of ethnic labelling, while questioning\u000d\u000a      assumptions about the meaning of the term \"American\" as well as \"Latino\" (source\u000d\u000a        2).\u000d\u000a    Retrieving previously neglected art and influencing institutional\u000d\u000a        decisions about its collection and display\u000d\u000a      In early 2010, Lewthwaite recovered artwork by local Dallas-based Mexican\u000d\u000a      American sculptor Octavio Medell&#237;n while on a fellowship at Southern\u000d\u000a      Methodist University (SMU). Her discovery highlighted the need for\u000d\u000a      archivists at the SMU Hamon Arts Library's Bywaters Special Collections to\u000d\u000a      develop more inclusive and representative archival resources, and\u000d\u000a      supported their decision to expand the digitization of the Medell&#237;n\u000d\u000a      archive. The head of the Bywaters Special Collections stated that\u000d\u000a      \"Lewthwaite's research has validated the decision to digitize the Medell&#237;n\u000d\u000a      archive and is evidence of the project's value\" (source 3). The\u000d\u000a      Digital Collections Developer added that Lewthwaite's research provided\u000d\u000a      \"documentation to support the funding of continued digitization efforts\"\u000d\u000a      by \"demonstrating how the digital collection can promote the study of\u000d\u000a      Mexican-American art, Texas regional art, and art history\" (source 4).\u000d\u000a      Lewthwaite's research has since helped promote the recovery of Medell&#237;n as\u000d\u000a      a Texas modernist. An art historian, who has included Medell&#237;n in a\u000d\u000a      forthcoming book as a result of Lewthwaite's research, explained that\u000d\u000a      Lewthwaite \"did much to `recover' [Medell&#237;n] as a truly bicultural\u000d\u000a      modernist\" and that she had successfully situated his work \"within a\u000d\u000a      broader, international sociological and cultural context\" (source 5).\u000d\u000a    Between 2010 and 2013, Bernier retrieved more than 150 photographs of the\u000d\u000a      black abolitionist Frederick Douglass, most of which were long-lost and\u000d\u000a      never published. Bernier's research has contextualised these many\u000d\u000a      photographic portraits as Douglass launching a black heroic tradition in\u000d\u000a      visual culture. The recovery process has included the identification of\u000d\u000a      images that were uncatalogued and unrecognized as Douglass, and\u000d\u000a      the dating of rare images for archivists at the collections that hold the\u000d\u000a      photographs. In one of many examples of consultation, Bernier helped\u000d\u000a      archivists at Michigan's Clements Library understand the significance of a\u000d\u000a      rare Douglass photograph that the library displayed for the first time.\u000d\u000a      Her insights added \"another layer of meaning\" to \"a never-before-seen\u000d\u000a      image\", explained the librarians. The \"investigation\" undertaken with\u000d\u000a      Bernier \"makes the image more intriguing\" and the library appreciated\u000d\u000a      Bernier's advice that the scrapbooked photograph in its original form \"may\u000d\u000a      have been an ambrotype, although there's a considerable likelihood that it\u000d\u000a      was a daguerreotype, which would make the original image an even greater\u000d\u000a      rarity\" (source 6).\u000d\u000a    Creating networks around Black and Latino visual culture that lead to\u000d\u000a        new practice, exhibitions, and areas of knowledge\u000d\u000a      As well as working with archivists on recovery, Bernier and Lewthwaite\u000d\u000a      have brought together archivists, curators, museum professionals, artists\u000d\u000a      and academics to share research and ideas about African American, Black\u000d\u000a      Diasporic and Latino art and artists. Bernier worked with Black British\u000d\u000a      artists, the Institute for North American Studies at King's College\u000d\u000a      London, and the Rothermere American Institute (RAI) at Oxford University\u000d\u000a      (as Senior Visiting Research Fellow in 2013) to offer a number of public\u000d\u000a      events and initiatives that helped to reshape curatorial thinking. For\u000d\u000a      example, as a result of Bernier's Terra Foundation-sponsored conference,\u000d\u000a      \"Art Across the Black Diaspora: Visualizing Slavery in America\" (RAI, May\u000d\u000a      2013, attended by 60 people) which brought together artists, curators, art\u000d\u000a      critics and scholars, one black British artist claimed that Bernier is\u000d\u000a      \"transforming the way that the work of artists and curators from the black\u000d\u000a      diaspora is critically discussed in studios, galleries and museums,\"\u000d\u000a      especially by encouraging audiences to connect black art with \"political\u000d\u000a      histories.\" She added: \"By consistently giving artists a most valuable\u000d\u000a      platform upon which to share the critical challenges of practice and\u000d\u000a      process, theory, history and politics, [Bernier] has allowed space for the\u000d\u000a      development of future partnerships and the possibility of new ways to\u000d\u000a      connect with future audiences\" (source 7). In an example of\u000d\u000a      early-stage impact that will be developed over the next three years,\u000d\u000a      Bernier also partnered with the Institute of International Visual Arts (a\u000d\u000a      leading UK contemporary visual arts organisation) to produce a new archive\u000d\u000a      of interviews with black British artists, many of whom were interviewed\u000d\u000a      for the first time.\u000d\u000a    A curator who attended Lewthwaite's Terra Foundation-sponsored\u000d\u000a      international symposium, \"Art Across Frontiers: Cross-Cultural Encounters\u000d\u000a      in America\" (April 2011; 28 attendees) has since used the work presented\u000d\u000a      at the symposium to organise a public lecture and exhibition on the\u000d\u000a      Guyanese artist Frank Bowling at Tate Britain titled \"Focus: Frank\u000d\u000a      Bowling\" (April 2012-March 2013). The Bowling exhibition generated a\u000d\u000a      series of online resources, including an artist's interview, a TateShots\u000d\u000a      video interview, a long form interview in Frieze Magazine (May\u000d\u000a      2012), and reviews in major UK newspapers and magazines (The Guardian,\u000d\u000a        Independent and TimeOut). The curator said of Lewthwaite's\u000d\u000a      symposium: \"These connections are invaluable.

Liberal democracy has sought to accommodate such diversity using\u000a      the model of minority rights, which deems all citizens equal regardless of\u000a      ethnic origin, but which also grants ethnic minorities certain positive\u000a      rights relating to their distinct culture. The practice of minority rights\u000a      is, however, far from uncontested, bringing into focus the question of how\u000a      to ensure that granting additional rights to particular sub-cultures does\u000a      not undermine overall societal cohesion or the integrity of the state.\u000a      Such contestation has been especially acute in the states that have\u000a      emerged in Central and Eastern Europe over the past century. In the newer\u000a      states of Central and Eastern Europe, lack of experience with democracy\u000a      coupled with memories of past border disputes and ethnic conflicts mean\u000a      that central governments often see territorially-based devolution of power\u000a      as a potential threat to state sovereignty and integrity, especially where\u000a      ethno-national boundaries overlap state borders.\u000a    Non-territorial cultural autonomy (NTCA) is viewed as a means of ensuring\u000a      peace between minorities and majorities, and protecting minority rights.\u000a      Until recently, however, little was known about the original NTCA model\u000a      and previous efforts to apply it within the region. Smith and Hiden's work\u000a      addressed this gap in the literature, and their research into the\u000a      potential of NTCA to provide a multicultural template for modern politics\u000a      continues to influence the debate around cultural autonomy in Europe.\u000a    Under international law, many of the Balkan states have a duty to create\u000a      conditions that enable real participation in decision-making processes by\u000a      various minority groups, these governments continue to express great\u000a      interest in NTCA as a method for facilitating this requirement. Smith's\u000a      research findings continue to influence national governments, political\u000a      parties and national minority representatives in the UK, Romania, Armenia,\u000a      Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia, the Council of Europe and the Organisation\u000a      for Security and Cooperation in Europe [1].\u000a    Since 2005, Smith's research team have contributed to the European Centre\u000a      for Minority Issues (ECMI)'s work on NCTA [2; 3]. The ECMI was set\u000a      up by European governments in collaboration with researchers to work on\u000a      minority issues and advise governments and other bodies such as the\u000a      Council of Europe and interested political parties supporting minority\u000a      rights throughout Europe. The ECMI believe that NTCA is a possible means\u000a      of introducing peaceful legislation for minorities, it remains one of\u000a      their key research topics and they continue to support the dissemination\u000a      of the theory to governments throughout Europe. In November 2012, Smith\u000a      co-organised a conference on NTCA in Belfast in conjunction with the ECMI\u000a      and Queens University, at which the Rt Hon Charles Clarke gave a keynote\u000a      speech discussing the relevance of NTCA concepts to multiculturalism and\u000a      minority rights around Europe and in a UK context [4]. The\u000a      conference was open to the public, and the conference\u000a        papers were published by Peter Lang in 2013.\u000a    Smith's work with the Romanian government on NTCA for the Hungarian\u000a      minority within Romania, continues to shape the debate between Hungary and\u000a      Romania. His 2005 briefing to the Romanian government in Bucharest on the\u000a      Estonian model of NTCA and the Smith and Hiden research findings provided\u000a      the basis for a minority law which was drafted to implement NTCA [5].\u000a      Although the ruling coalition lacked the two-thirds parliamentary majority\u000a      needed to pass the law, the concept of NTCA continues to significantly\u000a      impact public policy debates in Romania. In 2010, the Romanian government\u000a      announced the expansion of cultural and ethnic identity rights for\u000a      minorities, which was seen by some commentators, such as the campaigning\u000a      group DIVERS, as an attempt to move towards the aims of the law [6].\u000a      The law remains tabled for debate and some of the Hungarian minority in\u000a      Romania are now lobbying for territorial autonomy for the geographically\u000a      concentrated Hungarians in Transylvania and cultural autonomy for the rest\u000a      of the minorities (Bucharest\u000a          Herald, June 2012, `Hungarian Ambassador: Autonomy is the only\u000a      compromise solution and we'll obtain it'). The Hungarian government\u000a      supports cultural autonomy for diaspora Hungarians, and territorial\u000a      autonomy for large groups of Hungarians in other countries. The vice\u000a      president of Hungary was quoted in 2010 by the Romanian\u000a        news agency Agerpres; `For those Hungarians living in the\u000a        diaspora we seek cultural autonomy while for those living in blocks we\u000a        seek territorial autonomy &#8212; all these are European practices. If other\u000a        nations can, we can also within the EU norms.'\u000a    Therefore, the project has extended its consultancy role from the\u000a      Hungarian minority party in Romania to external policymakers and advisors\u000a      in Hungary proper. Smith has worked with the Institute for Research on\u000a      Hungarian Communities Abroad, a think tank established in 2011 by the\u000a      Hungarian government. In April 2013, he was the keynote speaker at a\u000a      conference in Budapest attended by the Deputy Prime Minister of Hungary,\u000a      Swiss MP and Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly member Andreas\u000a      Gross, the President of the Hungarian NTCA Council in Serbia,\u000a      representatives of Hungarian minorities from neighbouring countries, MPs,\u000a      journalists and representatives from embassies in Hungary, plus academics\u000a      and students, numbering around 100 people in total [7]. The\u000a      conference was entitled `Territorial Autonomies in Europe: Issues and\u000a      Challenges', but it encompassed broader issues of autonomy, including\u000a      non-territorial. Smith spoke on the theory and practice of non-territorial\u000a      autonomy.\u000a    The Armenian government drafted a law on national minorities following\u000a      the ECMI report on NTCA in 2005 &#8212; the law was in continuous debate in the\u000a      Armenian parliament from 2006-09 and the 2009 Council of Europe survey\u000a      reported that the Armenian government was developing a law on national\u000a      minorities. Although supported by the Council of Europe, Armenia's draft\u000a      legislation was ultimately defeated due to rising dissent over the\u000a      territorial versus non-territorial autonomy debate. The Council of Europe\u000a      Venice Commission has maintained an interest in NTCA particularly as a\u000a      result of the Armenian effort (Council of Europe: Committee of Ministers,\u000a      European\u000a          Charter for Regional or Minority Languages: Application of the Charter\u000a          in Armenia, 2nd Monitoring Cycle, 23 September 2009,\u000a      ECRML 2009). Briefings by Smith and Hiden to governments and minority\u000a      groups in Croatia in 2006 and Armenia, Hungary and Slovenia (2007) helped\u000a      to lay the groundwork for the widening debate.\u000a    The influence of University of Glasgow research and the ongoing priority\u000a      of the debate is evidenced by the Council of Europe reissuing Smith's\u000a      report on NTCA in Europe as part of Participation of Minorities in\u000a        Public Life, (Council of Europe, 2011) [1].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Non-territorial cultural autonomy (NTCA) is viewed as a means of ensuring\u000a      peace between minorities and majorities, and protecting minority rights.\u000a      University of Glasgow research into the historical application of NTCA\u000a      within Central and Eastern Europe and its potential to provide a\u000a      multicultural template for modern politics continues to influence the\u000a      debate around cultural autonomy in Europe.

In 2006 the project was awarded additional funding under\u000a      the AHRC's pilot Non-Academic User Dissemination Scheme, to fund a number\u000a      of joint academic-practitioner events.\u000a    This historically-based study illuminated broader European debates on the\u000a      political management of multiculturalism, both past and present. By\u000a      studying the practical implementation of non-territorial cultural autonomy\u000a      (NTCA) for national minorities in the inter-war Baltic States it brought\u000a      to light a long-neglected Central and East European contribution to\u000a      debates on minority rights, consolidation of democratic statehood and\u000a      European integration.\u000a    As a region, Eastern Europe has been historically associated with ethnic\u000a      intolerance and ethno-nationalist conflicts over territory. Both in the\u000a      inter-war period and today, liberal pluralism and minority rights have\u000a      been viewed as something to be `exported' from the West, as part of an\u000a      externally guided process of democratisation and state consolidation.\u000a      Smith's research highlighted an indigenous tradition of liberal\u000a      multiculturalism in the form of NTCA, first propounded at the turn of the\u000a      20th century by the Austrian Social Democrats Karl Renner and\u000a      Otto Bauer. In view of the highly complex, ethnically mixed patterns of\u000a      settlement that have historically been characteristic of Central and\u000a      Eastern Europe, Renner and Bauer argued that the exercise of national\u000a      minority rights should be linked not to particular territorial sub-regions\u000a      of the state, but to groups of persons &#8212; namely citizens professing a\u000a      particular ethnicity who freely choose to enter their names on a national\u000a      register. The members of the register then elect a cultural council with\u000a      public-legal status which oversees the day-to-day running of minority\u000a      language schooling and other cultural activities across the entire\u000a      territory of the state concerned.\u000a    NTCA is a model that has assumed a growing salience within post-communist\u000a      Central and Eastern Europe. Adopted by several states of the region and\u000a      discussed in several more, it has also elicited interest from relevant\u000a      international organisations working in the area of minority rights. Faced\u000a      with the legacy of historical border disputes within the region,\u000a      international minority rights actors have viewed NTCA as a potentially\u000a      useful way of counteracting the nationalist argument that minority\u000a      autonomy will necessarily fuel territorial irredentism. Smith's research\u000a      proved to be of interest and relevance to these actors, because it\u000a      analysed for the first time how the complex NTCA model had been applied in\u000a      practice during the inter-war period.\u000a    Of particular interest was Estonia's NTCA law of 1925 (restored to\u000a      existence in 1993), which represents the most complete application of this\u000a      concept to date. The research further demonstrated the extent to which the\u000a      NTCA principle informed European-level discussions of international\u000a      minority rights law during the 1920s, discussions which in many instances\u000a      bear a striking similarity to those currently taking place around minority\u000a      rights in the post-Cold War Europe.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34499","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    East Looks West (ELW) expanded horizons, particularly in eastern\u000a      Europe. By encouraging audiences to engage with different perceptions of\u000a      the world, ELW has challenged stereotypes, increased self-awareness in\u000a      East and West, promoted cross-cultural communication, and\u000a      contributed to debate on issues of difference and foreignness.ELW research\u000a      has contributed to the cultural life of east European audiences by\u000a      creating a new awareness of, and dialogue about, the richness and\u000a      diversity of travel writing from the region. Its publications have helped\u000a      to show the value of East European travel writing as a source for the\u000a      cultural history of Europe, and created new resources now used in\u000a        higher education in eastern Europe and beyond.\u000a    Through publications and media partnerships research contributed to\u000a        cultural life and stimulated discussions of travel and identity\u000a      across eastern Europe. Indicative evidence includes Romanian blogs (e.g.\u000a      on the utility of ELW approaches to East\/West divisions) and news reports\u000a      (e.g. ELW illuminating cross-cultural perceptions in the new EU) [1].\u000a      Bracewell's article `Lovrich's Joke' [e] was selected for translation and\u000a      broadcast on Croatian national public radio (9-10 May, 2013) for its\u000a      provocative use of `cultural cringe' to unpack Croatian attitudes to\u000a      `Western' cultural authority [2].\u000a    More specialised audiences influenced by ELW include collectors. Two\u000a      Greek examples are a) the uniquely valuable 30,000 volume E. J. Finopoulos\u000a      collection of travel books on the Balkans and Levant, and b) the private\u000a      Lekkas collection on Ionian history. Using ELW research, their consultant\u000a      librarian alerted these collectors to the significance of travel book\u000a      production in Eastern Europe, and made it possible to identify new items\u000a      for purchase, enlarging both the scope and utility of their collections\u000a      and contributing to a major scholarly and cultural resource. The\u000a      Finopoulos collection was recently donated to the Benaki Museum, thus\u000a      making these texts available to a wide public [3].\u000a    Research publications are used as unique educational resources\u000a      which enable teachers at higher education institutions to pose new\u000a      questions and introduce unfamiliar perspectives, particularly across local\u000a      linguistic boundaries, allowing the use of texts that were otherwise\u000a      inaccessible. For example, ELW resources counter mono-causal\u000a      interpretations of the `Western invention of Europe' in history syllabi\u000a      (Collegium Artes Liberales, Warsaw; Central European University, Budapest;\u000a      University of Szeged; McMaster University, Canada; University of St\u000a      Andrews), while courses in travel literature and cultural studies at the\u000a      Universities of Cyprus, Bucharest and Prague use ELW research to contrast\u000a      eastern and western European travellers and introduce specifically east\u000a      European perspectives [4]. A Bucharest public symposium used Under\u000a        Eastern Eyes [b] to focus discussion of Romanian reconfigurations of\u000a      identity, and a teachers' handbook from the University of Athens uses Where\u000a        to Go in Europe [f] to explore foreign city-soundscapes [5].\u000a      Indeed, the availability of ELW publications on pirate download sites such\u000a      as LibraryGenesis, hosted in Russia, is further evidence of demand!\u000a    Where to Go in Europe [f] was an important channel using\u000a      accessible and amusing content to promote public engagement with the\u000a      research. This anthologised travellers' lavatorial anecdotes to show how a\u000a      universal necessity has been used to construct East\/West divisions and\u000a      thus engage an English-speaking public with the ideas of constructed\u000a        differences examined in the research described in section 2. First\u000a      printed in 2009, and praised by Times Literary Supplement Editor Peter\u000a      Stothard on the TLS Blog [6], all 200 copies were rapidly distributed. In\u000a      May 2013, students in UCL's MA in Publishing produced an expanded edition\u000a      of 650 print copies and an e-version, launched through a series of\u000a      exhibitions, readings and interviews attended by some 200 visitors,\u000a      predominantly young, non-academic Londoners and tourists. Lively comment\u000a      focused on a new awareness of cultural construction, prompted by\u000a      travellers' expectations (e.g. \"what is a normal toilet?\"). In the\u000a      first two months following the re-issue (to 31 July 2013), a third of the\u000a      print-run (208 copies) was sold at a RRP of &#163;4.99. Sales were to a broad\u000a      audience beyond the academic community, such as a book club whose convenor\u000a      cited the combination of accessibility and serious message. Other\u000a      responses emphasised the effectiveness of toilet humour as a prompt to\u000a      self-reflection: as an Amazon reviewer stated: \"The book's pervasive\u000a      humour, by inviting us to laugh at these constructed differences,\u000a      simultaneously does its part in working to dissolve them\"; \"shows that\u000a      differences, within the Balkans, and also East\/West, are never so clear\u000a      and consistent as imagined\" [7].\u000a    In 2009, Professor Bracewell organised a series of public engagement\u000a      events together with the Leverhulme writer-in-residence Tony White, using\u000a      ELW research into east European representations of London, which provided\u000a        an important London forum for public debate on experiences of migration.\u000a      Destination London (19 October to 7 November 2009) events included\u000a      podcasts of readings, a radio broadcast on east European London in\u000a      collaboration with Resonance FM, a book launch, a public panel of travel\u000a      writers, and writing workshops which promoted cross-cultural\u000a      communication between migrants and hosts. The reach is demonstrated by the\u000a      attendance: around 200 people (about half of east European heritage)\u000a      attended and many commented that it was their first engagement with\u000a      academic research on migration. The significance of this impact is\u000a      demonstrated by the fact that all available books sold out (worth over\u000a      &#163;1,000). The lively discussions at the event were echoed in the positive\u000a      visitor feedback received (\"Tonight really helped me understand my\u000a      feelings as an immigrant in London, and as a Londoner back at home in\u000a      Poland\"). Subsequent coverage of the event in the Croatian press (Ve&#269;ernji\u000a        list, Zagreb, 24 Nov 2009; one of the two largest dailies in the\u000a      country), noting the significance of London as a Croatian destination,\u000a      applauded ELW's recognition of `a new outlook on the city' created by\u000a      immigrant travel writing [8].\u000a    The success of the 2009 event was repeated in 2013 at Through\u000a        Different Eyes, part of UCL's Festival of the Arts, 11-12 May 2013.\u000a      This actively sought to use research to challenge stereotypes in the\u000a      context of UK debate on east European immigration, and thus contribute\u000a        to social cohesion and cultural understanding. Some 50 participants,\u000a      British, Polish and Romanian, used travel writing to look `through\u000a      different eyes', in a reading group and discussions with artists, writers\u000a      and workers. The positive feedback indicated that the experience was\u000a      transformative for both migrants and hosts, deepening discourse about\u000a      migration by including the voices of those who are more often depicted\u000a      than heard. Comments included: \"many times it revealed not only the\u000a      ignorance about the `foreigner' but also the contradictions in the `eyes'\u000a      of the viewer!\"; \"I think that we can understand a country, no matter\u000a      which, when we stop comparing with what is familiar to us\"; \"We are not so\u000a      different, but what a gap between us! If only that type of exchanges of\u000a      ideas would happened more often, maybe the gap was smaller\"; \"the other\u000a      side of the story is how outsiders have themselves reshaped the city and\u000a      have actively transformed it\". The events were reported by UK migrant\u000a      blogs, showing reach within the community. One Romanian migrant, after\u000a      reading an 1840 ELW travelogue of London, blogged his own version:\u000a      \"I follow in Codru's trail and see London today as a very different city.\u000a      But Codru has opened my eyes to things I did not see before\". This text\u000a      was subsequently republished by a website showcasing oral histories of\u000a      migration for a popular and academic audience in Romania and was\u000a      accompanied by a report, applauding the attempt to understand migration\u000a      `from within' in contrast to UK tabloid journalism [9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Wendy Bracewell's collaborative, cross-disciplinary project\u000a      focuses on Europe's limits and divisions as depicted and debated in East\u000a      European travel writing from 1550 to the present day.

Historically, travel writing\u000a      from eastern Europe was little known outside its countries of origin,\u000a      while even in eastern Europe, it tended to be studied as a minor literary\u000a      genre. ELW discovered a wealth of east European travel writing about\u000a      Europe and demonstrated how east Europeans used this genre for their own\u000a      purposes relating to audiences at home and abroad. An important finding\u000a      was the wide diversity of responses to perceptions of European difference,\u000a      from `cultural cringe' to insouciant superiority. ELW showed that east\u000a      European travel writing played an important role in the complex\u000a      transnational interactions that created understandings of European\u000a      belonging and otherness, modernity and backwardness, civilisation and\u000a      barbarism, `East', `West' and indeed `Europe'. Ultimately, ELW proved that\u000a      travellers from eastern Europe have been active agents in creating\/using\u000a      these ideas, rather than being simply the objects of others'\u000a      representations.\u000a    The research directly underpinning impact was led by Professor Bracewell\u000a      at UCL in an AHRC project entitled `East Looks West: East European travel\u000a      writing on Europe, 1550-2000' (01\/09\/2001 to 31\/12\/2005) which led to the\u000a      publication of two collective volumes: an anthology of texts [a in section\u000a      3] and a collection of essays [b], as well as a bibliography [c] and a\u000a      popular anthology [f]. In addition to being sole or co-editor, she\u000a      contributed key chapters, selected and edited the texts for the scholarly\u000a      anthology, and translated about 30% of them. Her collaborator in the AHRC\u000a      project was Alex Drace-Francis (post-doctoral scholar and lecturer at UCL\u000a      until 2005, then of Liverpool, now University of Amsterdam), a\u000a      collaboration which continues to the present. Drace-Francis co-edited and\u000a      contributed research to the collective volumes.\u000a    More broadly, research led by Professor Bracewell between 2001-2013 has\u000a      identified materials, collated and translated key texts, and provided a\u000a      framework for the use of travelogues to study ideas of European\u000a      identities. Professor Bracewell and her colleagues elaborated a definition\u000a      for `east European travel writing' and established a periodisation for its\u000a      development; made surveys of the place of travel writing in the national\u000a      literatures of the region (in many cases providing the first systematic\u000a      bibliographies of these texts); published annotated translations into\u000a      English; convened conferences and public events in the UK and abroad\u000a      focusing on travel writing as a window into the world, but also into the\u000a      writers' own cultures; and published studies aimed both at scholarly and\u000a      more popular audiences.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34500","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1220409","Name":"Tajikistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Gerry's research has stimulated debate and discussion both within and\u000a      beyond academic circles, in the UK, the US and in the regions under\u000a      discussion, about health in post-Communist societies, particularly\u000a      demonstrating the need for indigenous capacity in health economics. This\u000a      led to the establishment of a project in 2011, co-directed by Gerry, to\u000a      develop health economics as a part of core economics teaching and research\u000a      at universities across the region.

These invitations\u000a      themselves and the subsequent delivery of talks based on the research\u000a      demonstrated and enhanced its contribution to a raised awareness of both\u000a      the importance and the absence of a capacity for health economics\u000a      in the region. Prior to this, where health economics existed at all, it\u000a      was based largely on the financial management of health care organisations\u000a      rather than being seen as part of the behavioural social sciences bridging\u000a      economics and public health [2].\u000a    Following one of these visits, Gerry applied with Dr Yulia Vymyatnina\u000a      (European University, St Petersburg) to the Open Society Foundations'\u000a      Higher Education Support Program, from which they sought support for a\u000a      project (ReSET) to develop health economics as a part of the core\u000a      Economics teaching and research syllabus at universities across Russia,\u000a      Central Asia and Eastern Europe. The findings published in [b] were\u000a      central to this application, particularly as they related to: the complex\u000a      relations between socioeconomic events and health outcomes; the challenges\u000a      of finding robust relationships using econometrics; and the importance of\u000a      linking empirical work to both the theoretical underpinnings of the\u000a      discipline and the area specificities conditioning the relationship. On\u000a      the basis of these findings, the training programme was designed to\u000a      combine a theoretical and an empirical approach to the dynamics of health\u000a      production which enabled it to address the specific weaknesses of health\u000a      economics teaching in the region, while also recognising the importance of\u000a      the controversies on which the research focused.\u000a    Their application was approved in 2011, since which date Gerry and\u000a      Vymyatnina have co-directed the almost $500,000 `Global Health Economics'\u000a      programme. The programme, which involves multiple international experts as\u000a      expert faculty (lecturers), provides exposure to and training in\u000a      contemporary methods and thinking in health economics to early career\u000a      economists and health specialists in universities in the post-Communist\u000a      states of Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Tajikistan and Croatia.\u000a      Expertise delivered through the programme has been drawn from across the\u000a      globe with a view to providing the most solid foundation possible in\u000a      theoretical health economics and a good understanding (through the use of\u000a      the research outlined in section 2) of methods for empirical research in\u000a      health economics. Since 2011, the Global Health Economics programme has\u000a      delivered eleven sessions on topics such as Health Financing, Economics of\u000a      Evaluation and Applied Health Econometrics to 30 young academics from 15\u000a      different universities in the region, recruited through a competitive\u000a      selection process in early 2011. Participants all attended annual two-week\u000a      intensive summer sessions held in St Petersburg in July 2011, 2012 and\u000a      2013, as well as shorter winter sessions in February 2012 and 2013; a\u000a      final session is scheduled for April 2014. In between, there were site\u000a      training visits and sub-group meetings in Sumy (May 2012 and 2013), Almaty\u000a      (May 2012 and 2013), Moscow (2011, 2013) and Nizhny Novgorod (June 2013).\u000a      Participants also worked interactively on their teaching and research\u000a      portfolios throughout the period under the online mentorship of the\u000a      programme's international faculty. Through this, they generated shared\u000a      resources [3] for health economics. The programme has allowed participants\u000a      to engage in collaborative research projects in the health economics field\u000a      and equipped them with the tools to establish contemporary health\u000a      economics programmes in their own universities for the first time. The\u000a      resultant paradigm shift, both in participants' approach to research and\u000a      in the incorporation within their home institutions of health studies into\u000a      mainstream economics courses, has already led to the development and\u000a      delivery of new or improved programmes in the region.\u000a    These and other benefits of the project &#8212; the continuation of which is\u000a      contingent on the demonstration of its impacts across the region &#8212; are\u000a      revealed through its scrutiny (most recently in May 2013) by external\u000a      reviewers tasked with compiling an annual audit report [2] and through\u000a      participant feedback [4]. The latter established that Health Economics\u000a      (HE) courses either had been or were being introduced for the first time\u000a      or in substantially reformed mode in major state universities in Ukraine,\u000a      Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Russia and Croatia, as demonstrated by the table\u000a      below (derived from [4]):\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          University\u000a          Did HE exist\u000a            at the start of\u000a            the project?\u000a          Has HE provision been\u000a            introduced or\u000a            substantially changed as\u000a            a result of the project?\u000a          Are you now engaging\u000a            in HE research,\u000a            whereas you weren&#8217;t\u000a            previously?\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Higher School of Economics,\u000a            Moscow (Russia\u000a          Yes\u000a          Yes\u000a          Yes\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          European University, St\u000a            Petersburg (Russia)\u000a          No\u000a          Yes\u000a          Yes\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Sumy University (Ukraine)\u000a          No\u000a          Yes\u000a          Yes\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Zagreb University (Croatia)\u000a          Yes\u000a          Yes\u000a          Yes\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Almaty (Kazakhstan)\u000a          No\u000a          Yes\u000a          Yes\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dushanbe (Tajikistan)\u000a          No\u000a          Yes\u000a          No\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Penza (Russia)\u000a          No\u000a          Yes\u000a          No\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Novosibirsk (Russia)\u000a          n\/a\u000a          n\/a\u000a          Yes\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Nizhny Novgorod (Russia)\u000a          No\u000a          Yes\u000a          Yes\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    The participant feedback below, from 2012, confirms the benefits both to\u000a      participants themselves and more broadly to the institutions to which they\u000a      belong:\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    The programme's impact and reach has been such that a new research\u000a      laboratory (`Department of Economics of Health Reform') in Moscow under\u000a      the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public\u000a      Administration was established.

Lancet 31:373(9661):399&#8212;407) published in\u000a      January 2009. The article claimed a causal link between mass privatisation\u000a      and a 13% rise in male mortality in post-Communist societies, a claim that\u000a      the UCL team interrogated on three specific grounds: (i) methodological\u000a      (was the econometric approach robust?); (ii) conceptual (was the logic\u000a      underpinning the causal pathway consistent with health production?); (iii)\u000a      contextual (was the institutional and societal context correctly used and\u000a      interpreted?).\u000a    They found that the link claimed for the relationship between mass\u000a      privatisation and mortality did not stand up to closer scrutiny. In\u000a      particular, they argued in an article published in 2010 [a] that the\u000a      health trends at the root of the claimed association actually pre-dated\u000a      the initiation of mass privatisation programmes and that on closer\u000a      inspection the trends did not differ greatly between privatisers and\u000a      non-privatisers. Most significantly, they argued that the original claims\u000a      stemmed from a misunderstanding of the ways in which health is produced\u000a      and in which socioeconomic outcomes, policies and institutions interact in\u000a      post-Communist states, and demonstrated the importance of understanding\u000a      empirical methodologies and their relation with theoretical approaches and\u000a      country specificities.\u000a    This observation resulted in a more conceptually oriented follow-up piece\u000a      of work published in 2012 [b] which, by illustrating the importance of\u000a      correctly specifying the underlying data-generating process in the context\u000a      of Russia and Eastern Europe, showed that mass privatisation was not\u000a      associated with post-Communist mortality fluctuations. In reaching this\u000a      conclusion, Gerry tested all plausible models accounting for the temporal\u000a      dependencies of the data and found no evidence of a relationship between\u000a      mass privatisation and male mortality fluctuations. While the research\u000a      raised important questions concerning the dynamic nature of health\u000a      production, it also highlighted the complexity of the health patterns\u000a      emerging in the post-Communist world and the need for indigenous research\u000a      and teaching in health economics to understand these.\u000a    This work prompted successful applications for further research funded by\u000a      Nuffield (2011&#8212;13) and the European Commission (2011), and in 2012 led to\u000a      the invited publication of the key research findings in Social Science\u000a        and Medicine [c]. Here, Gerry discussed the complexities of the\u000a      causal pathways between socio-economic change and ill-health, emphasising\u000a      the need for further exploration of the catastrophic patterns of mortality\u000a      and morbidity characteristic of the post-Communist world.\u000a    These three publications ([a], [b], [c]), which draw on aggregate-level\u000a      data from the post-Communist region, make a significant contribution to a\u000a      debate in the literature relating to that region, and represent the core\u000a      of the research underpinning impacts outlined below. They, in turn,\u000a      stimulated two smaller projects enabling a microeconomic exploration of\u000a      the ways in which health is produced at the level of the individual. In\u000a      this subsequent research, Gerry worked with Georgios Papadapoulos (UEA) on\u000a      further analysis of health persistence, this time specifically in Russia,\u000a      using data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. The work,\u000a      which drew on the combined strengths of Gerry's expertise in Russian data\u000a      and socioeconomic contexts and Papadapoulos' experience of handling large\u000a      data sets, provided further support for the hypothesis that the health\u000a      production process is fundamentally dynamic, underscoring the singularity\u000a      of the post-Communist context.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34544","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above has been used by businesses and provided a\u000a      basis for legal rulings and expert testimony in British courts.\u000a    Impacts on Legal Understanding and Judicial Rulings\u000a      Professor Ledeneva's research has been widely used in legal proceedings,\u000a      informing both commercial and extradition cases in London.

An example of this is provided by one major extradition lawyer\u000a      who has represented Russian individuals living in England but charged with\u000a      criminal offences in Russia, leading to extradition requests.

Ledeneva's\u000a      research on telephone justice was used to argue (inter alia) that the\u000a      accused could not receive a fair trial in Russia unless special measures\u000a      were taken. The request for extradition was eventually dropped [3].\u000a      Another example was that of the expert witness report on the Russian\u000a      political and legal regime in the $5bn Berezovsky -v- Abramovich case\u000a      before Justice Gloster in 2012 [4].\u000a    The research has also been quoted directly by judges in rulings on high\u000a      profile commercial cases, including the &#163;2 billion suit by Michael Cherney\u000a      against his fellow oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, in which Cherney claimed that\u000a      he was owed a share of Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer.\u000a      First brought in 2006, the case was notably predicated on a request that\u000a      the claim be served in London, rather than Russia. In his widely cited\u000a      ruling on Cherney -v- Deripaska (2008), High Court Judge Mr Justice\u000a      Christopher Clarke directly cited Ledeneva's research [c, e] in support of\u000a      his ruling that Cherney did indeed have the right to sue Deripaska in an\u000a      English court due to `the risks inherent in a trial in Russia'. In making\u000a      this judgment, he referred particularly to `persistent rumours of\u000a      \"telephone justice\", where the state or a senior judge gives the judge\u000a      instructions to decide the case as was the norm in the Soviet era' [5].\u000a      This decision was unanimously upheld in the Court of Appeal in 2009 [6].\u000a      In an analysis of this much-discussed decision, a lawyer at the commercial\u000a      law firm Herbert Smith LLP pointed out that: `Clarke was further persuaded\u000a      by expert evidence that in Russia, in cases where the government itself is\u000a      a party and which concern a direct material strategic interest of the\u000a      Russian state, the courts may depart from their generally fair and\u000a      impartial performance in a commercial dispute between private persons'\u000a      [7].\u000a    Impacts on Corporate Training and Consultancy\u000a      In 2012, Transparency International ranked Russia 133rd out of 174\u000a      countries on its corruption perception index, and according to some\u000a      estimates, corruption accounts for 20-30% of the cost of doing business in\u000a      Russia. However, the real picture on the ground is extremely complex, and\u000a      businesses employ a wide range of internal and external strategies to\u000a      navigate and tackle corruption. As a result, Ledeneva's expertise on\u000a      informal practices was frequently solicited by business intelligence\u000a      consultancies and think tanks in the UK, US and Europe; during the impact\u000a      period, she received several requests for talks which led to her work\u000a      being utilised for business intelligence services to a wide range of\u000a      corporate clients, but particularly large banking institutions, by Alaco\u000a      and GPW [8].\u000a    Ledeneva has also drawn on her research ([b] above) in work conducted\u000a      between 2010 and 2013 with Professor Stanislav Shekshnia of INSEAD, one of\u000a      the world's leading graduate business schools, with campuses in France,\u000a      Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Here, her work was used to devise surveys on\u000a      informal practices to help CEOs and other executives to reflect on the\u000a      variety of informal practices in their own organisations, to monitor and\u000a      assess the subsequent risk of corruption there, and to devise strategies\u000a      to manage them in this unique context [f]. Informal practices identified\u000a      in Ledeneva's work constitute 27 entries in the questionnaire, thus\u000a      enabling executives to reflect on the variety of informal practices in\u000a      their organisations. Ledeneva's expertise on informal practices and\u000a      corruption therefore allowed the development of this innovative corporate\u000a      tool for the identification, measurement and mitigation of corruption\u000a      risks.\u000a    These surveys were disseminated to 140 senior managers through three\u000a      training sessions (2010-12) on managing corruption in the INSEAD\u000a      executive education programme at Fontainebleau and Singapore. They were\u000a      subsequently used for almost 1,000 managers in the Sberbank-5000 INSEAD\u000a      executive development programme [10]. In 2009-12 she also conducted\u000a      executive workshops for approximately 40 executives from DTEK (Ukraine),\u000a      NIS (Serbia) and Gazpromneft (Russia) [10]. The academic programme\u000a      director, and Ledeneva's collaborator, cited the positive rating her\u000a      sessions received (3.9 out of 5), and noted that several attendees had\u000a      utilised the materials independently; one launched an internal corruption\u000a      mitigation programme, while another applied the methodology to their North\u000a      African operations [10]. Russia's third-largest oil company, TNK-BP, for\u000a      example, incorporated the surveys into training materials for executives\u000a      in Singapore (September and October 2011) and for alumni conferences in\u000a      Moscow (December 2011), whilst PricewaterhouseCoopers sponsored a lecture\u000a      on Russian cases in London courts at the Great Britain Russia Society,\u000a      London (2 December 2009) and a PwC in-house talk on 18 March 2010 [9].\u000a      These tools thus provided a new approach to understanding and tackling\u000a      corruption in the Russian context, and of developing ways to address it by\u000a      drawing on tools developed on the basis of Ledeneva's research [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted at UCL by Professor Alena Ledeneva on informal\u000a      practices and governance networks in Russia led to the development of\u000a      tools used by senior executives at international corporations working in\u000a      Russia and elsewhere to evaluate and manage the risk of corruption in\u000a      their organisations. The research also influenced the rulings and expert\u000a      testimony provided in British courts affecting the outcomes of major\u000a      commercial trials such as Cherney -v- Deripaska (2008) and Berezovsky -v-\u000a      Abramovich (2011) as well as in extradition cases at the Westminster\u000a      District Court in London.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3018074","Name":"Fontainebleau"},{"GeoNamesId":"524901","Name":"Moscow"},{"GeoNamesId":"292968","Name":"Abu Dhabi"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[a] Alena V.

Professor Ledeneva began at UCL as a Lecturer in 1999, and was\u000a      promoted to a Chair in 2008.\u000a    Ledeneva's research at UCL builds on her earlier work on Russia's economy\u000a      of favours which helped to solve a double puzzle in the history of\u000a      authoritarian regimes: in Soviet times, reliance on informal networks\u000a      allowed people to survive in an economy of shortage, just as it allowed\u000a      the Soviet regime to endure despite the systemic inefficiency of its\u000a      institutions. While formally supporting the regime, people engaged in\u000a      multiple informal practices in order to mitigate its pressure. Blat\u000a      &#8212; the use of personal networks for getting things done - provides just one\u000a      example of the many informal practices that both made the regime more\u000a      tolerable and, at the same time, helped to undermine it, thus serving both\u000a      continuity and change. Her 2000 publication [a] developed Ledeneva's\u000a      analysis of the ambivalent nature of informal practices that both\u000a      subverted and supported institutions in both the Soviet and post-Soviet\u000a      eras.\u000a    Subsequent research has examined the informal practices that replaced blat\u000a      during Russia's dramatic break-up with its communist past [b].\u000a      `Democratic' and `market' institutions, including competitive elections,\u000a      free media, independent judiciary and secure property rights, to be\u000a      established during the 1990s, became enveloped in informal practices that\u000a      both facilitated their development and undermined it. Kompromat, black\u000a        piar, krugovaya poruka, barter and double accounting were the most\u000a      widespread in that period [b]. Arguing that such practices constitute\u000a      important indicators in assessing the outcomes of reform, Ledeneva turned\u000a      to analysis of the network-based system of informal governance &#8212; Putin's sistema\u000a      &#8212; characterised by informal incentives, control and capital flows operated\u000a      by power networks [c]. What it lacks in democratic graces the sistema\u000a      appears to compensate, according to Ledeneva, with the effectiveness of\u000a      its networks and relationships and their impressive capacity to mobilise\u000a      [c].\u000a    Aiming to disaggregate predominant notions of corruption, Ledeneva argues\u000a      that informal practices not only can be measured, but constitute\u000a      indicators that can be instrumental in policy-making. Although informal\u000a      practices do not readily lend themselves to quantitative analysis,\u000a      Professor Ledeneva devised a survey measuring the public perception of\u000a      informal pressure on the judiciary from the executive (so-called\u000a      `telephone justice') [d]. A representative sample of 1,600 respondents was\u000a      used in 2007, funded by the British Academy, followed by a repeated survey\u000a      in 2010, commissioned by the EU-Russia Centre, which found that\u000a      perceptions of extra-legal pressure on the judiciary remained widespread,\u000a      despite multiple legal reforms undertaken by president Medvedev.\u000a      Ledeneva's research identified the global implications of the weak rule of\u000a      law in Russia, associated with `telephone justice' driving litigants away\u000a      from Russian courts and towards British courts, resulting in Russia's loss\u000a      of sovereignty as major decisions on Russian assets are decided in High\u000a      Courts in London [c, d].\u000a    In a 2009 paper, Ledeneva argued that the post-communist experience\u000a      doesn't fit the global corruption paradigm [e]. To reveal the implications\u000a      of post-communist corruption in the corporate sector, Ledeneva\u000a      collaborated with Stanislav Shekshnia (Affiliate Professor of\u000a      Entrepreneurship at INSEAD) to survey informal practices and mitigating\u000a      strategies by 111 CEOs operating in Russia, the outcome of the pilot\u000a      survey has been published in 2011 [f]. Devising alternative measurements\u000a      of corruption has since become the core of the FP7 project\u000a      \"Anti-Corruption Policies Revisited: Global Trends and European Responses\u000a      to the Challenge of Corruption\" (2012-2017), a large-scale research\u000a      project funded by the European Commission, where Ledeneva plays a leading\u000a      role.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35617","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Conflict management in Iraq's disputed territories\u000a    Research by Stansfield on conflict causation and management in Iraq\u000a      helped steer the activities of the UN mission tasked with facilitating\u000a      negotiations between the Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan\u000a      Regional Government (KRG). In 2008, the FCO recommended Stansfield to act\u000a      as a Senior Political Adviser to the UN's Special Representative of the\u000a      Secretary General (SRSG) in Iraq &#8212; a position he held throughout 2008 and\u000a      which included a three-month stay in Iraq. During this time, he was tasked\u000a      by the SRSG to discuss possible strategies with the Kurdish leadership.\u000a    In 2009, Stansfield's research on the disputed territories and Kurdish\u000a      political mobilization had a direct input into the drafting of the UN's\u000a      recommendations for the resolution of the disputed territories, with the\u000a      UN Department of Political Affairs staff utilizing his co-authored book Crisis\u000a        in Kirkuk extensively. Stansfield's research on range of options for\u000a      the future status of Kirkuk (inclusion in either Iraq or in Kurdistan;\u000a      resolution of Kirkuk's territorial status and its separation the question\u000a      of its oil reserves) informed the shaping of the UN Assistance Mission for\u000a      Iraq's (UNAMI) report on `Disputed Internal Boundaries in Iraq', published\u000a      in 2009, but still under embargo. Since then, Stansfield's expertise on\u000a      Arab-Kurd politics has been noted by the private sector, with him acting\u000a      as an adviser to the senior management of Shell on the politics of Kirkuk,\u000a      with the Chairman of Shell Iraq noting the importance of Crisis in\u000a        Kirkuk (2009) to Shell's deliberations. Stansfield has also chaired\u000a      US Government events on this subject, and briefed research analysts and\u000a      ambassadors-designate of the FCO regularly, with his book Iraq\u000a      (2008) recommended to FCO staff beginning their work on Iraq as essential\u000a      reading, as an ideal way of introducing them to a complex country in a\u000a      detached, dispassionate, fashion.\u000a    Political mobilization and civil war dynamics in Iraq\u000a    Stansfield's research informed guidelines for asylum\/human rights\u000a      determination process through being cited in the UK Border Agency's `UK\u000a      Country of Information Report on the Kurdistan Region as a separate and\u000a      independent region of Iraq' in April (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1fgmu7m),\u000a      revised in September 2009, and the Country of Information Report on Iraq\u000a      in December 2009. These reports provide general background information for\u000a      officials involved in human rights' claims in the UK. Stansfield\u000a      independently reviewed and made recommendations on the original version of\u000a      these documents and when the Office of the Independent Chief Inspector of\u000a      UKBA convened a meeting of the Independent Advisory Group on Country\u000a      Information on the 19th of May 2009 (http:\/\/bit.ly\/18GN3eZ),\u000a      it was noted in the minutes that `the UKBA had responded positively to\u000a        nearly all of the recommendations made by Professor Stansfield\u000a      [report Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) area of Iraq] and had\u000a        amended the COI report accordingly'. Moreover it was noted that `The\u000a        group considered Professor Stansfield's report [to be] very helpful\u000a        because he set out the information gaps and suggested where further\u000a        information was needed. For this reason the group agreed his report\u000a        should be used as an example of best practice for distribution to future\u000a        authors'.\u000a    Post conflict stabilization and approaches to state building\u000a    In response to the sudden downturn of the security situation in Iraq, the\u000a      US employed a different strategy (the `surge' strategy) through localising\u000a      of security structures in a bid to defeat the threat posed by Al-Qaeda in\u000a      Iraq (AQI) and the Shi'a Jaish al-Mahdi. Stansfield's research\u000a      considered how Coalition actions had exacerbated tensions within Iraqi\u000a      society rather than resolve them, as reported in the House of Commons\u000a      Select Committee on Foreign Affairs Sixth Report of 2005\u000a      (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1bv5U3P). In high-level meetings, Stansfield presented his\u000a      research on the regional mobilization of political communities in Iraq and\u000a      the possibility of structuring military forces along regimental lines &#8212;\u000a      i.e. recruiting from localities, finding local solutions to local security\u000a      problems. Following Stansfield's 2007 Chatham House Briefing Paper (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1gGTXpF)\u000a      the research's impact was further extended through discussions held with\u000a      senior UK military officials tasked with working alongside US counterparts\u000a      on improving security. Stansfield's 2007 research also impacted upon the\u000a      Coalition's 2007\/8 `surge' strategy aimed at removing the Al-Qaeda\u000a      insurgency threat from Iraq, with him providing analysis and advice\u000a      directly to the Director of Intelligence at the Permanent Joint\u000a      Headquarters (PJHQ), on strategies to defeat Al-Qaeda in Iraq and further\u000a      the Coalition reconciliation effort. His involvement in this area was\u000a      highlighted by an invitation to present a paper on the subject at the Iraq\u000a      Inquiry in 2009 (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1eXG1vV)\u000a      and he has since contributed to the writing of UK stabilization doctrine\u000a      in events held at the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) of\u000a      the Ministry of Defence (http:\/\/bit.ly\/16dD4nx). Following this engagement\u000a      with the military, Stansfield has been asked to join several ad hoc\u000a      working groups tasked with advising on the interaction of the UK with\u000a      nascent Syrian opposition groups, (evidence: DFID funded project through\u000a      Coffey International focused upon the capacity-building of Syrian\u000a      opposition groups in the Kurdish north; adviser to Chief Joint Operations\u000a      (CJO) Permanent Joint Headquarters). Stansfield has also won a further\u000a      unsolicited USIP\/Chatham House award to undertake work on Iraq's foreign\u000a      policy formulation, being the one of the first academics to recognise that\u000a      at least two foreign policy structures existed in Iraq (Stansfield 2010).\u000a    Further impact and benefit\u000a    In 2010, Stanfield's research informed policy makers by being cited in a\u000a      House of Commons research paper `The Arab uprising' and pointed to the\u000a      similarities between the situation in Iraq after the fall of Saddam\u000a      Hussein and Libya (http:\/\/bit.ly\/15aU4o8).\u000a      His work on counter-insurgency saw him invited to be a founding member of\u000a      the `PJHQ Red-Team', designed to inform the Chief of Defence Staff on\u000a      strategic options in Libya. And, in 2011, regarding the Arab Kurd dispute,\u000a      his research was cited in the United States Forces `Iraq' commissioned\u000a      report by RAND National Defence Research Institute `Managing Arab-Kurd\u000a      Tensions in Northern Iraq After the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops' aimed at\u000a      informing US policy makers on preparations for the withdrawal of US troops\u000a      from Iraq.

By 2004 and onwards,\u000a      the security situation in Iraq began to deteriorate rapidly and several\u000a      civil wars unfolded as different communities of Iraqis began to coalesce\u000a      around ethnic and sectarian identities. Stansfield's research programme\u000a      considered conflict management, political mobilization, and the rebuilding\u000a      of the state in Iraq.\u000a    In 2002, Stansfield was awarded a Leverhulme Trust Special Research\u000a      Fellowship to investigate `The reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq',\u000a      between 2002 and 2004. The dates of the fellowship occurred alongside the\u000a      move towards regime-change. As such, the research programme maintained a\u000a      degree of flexibility to take into account post-conflict developments,\u000a      allowing the research findings to be targeted on particular issues of\u000a      relevance to the policymaking community. The research focused on the rise\u000a      of communal politics in Iraq, and possible mechanisms by which they could\u000a      be managed in a post-conflict setting, including consociationalism and\u000a      asymmetric federalism (Stansfield 2003; Anderson and Stansfield 2004).\u000a      Research additionally considered the impact of Coalition policies upon the\u000a      stability of the post-conflict environment. This research theme was\u000a      further developed following the awarding of a grant by the United States\u000a      Institute for Peace (USIP) on `Investigating Political Mobilization in\u000a      Iraqi Kurdistan', held from 2005 to 2007. The thematic of ethno-sectarian\u000a      political mobilization proved to be significant to policy makers due to\u000a      the unfolding of a range of fast-moving inter- and intra-communal wars\u000a      from 2004 onwards. Stansfield's research contributed significantly to the\u000a      debate on causation and, importantly in terms of impact, the policy level\u000a      debate on managing the situation through federal and power-sharing\u000a      arrangements (Stansfield 2007). This work contextualised a successful\u000a      application for &#163;738,000 made to the Leverhulme Trust Research Leadership\u000a      Award scheme on `Ethnopolitics in a Globalized World', which then further\u000a      supported additional research on Iraq.\u000a    The second part of Stansfield's research programme focused specifically\u000a      on the Arab-Kurdish dispute in Iraq, and particularly upon the disputed\u000a      city and region of Kirkuk. The research benefited from the awarding of a\u000a      Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship entitled `Between Arabs, Kurds, and\u000a      Turkmens: Managing Kirkuk', held from 2007 to 2009. The research\u000a      culminated in several articles (such as items 1. and 3. in section 3.\u000a      below) and a monograph (Anderson and Stansfield 2009). This research\u000a      coincided with Kurdish-Arab relations faltering and the status of Kirkuk\u000a      turning into one of the most volatile situations in Iraq. The many\u000a      findings of this work identified the relative claims of the different\u000a      communities, and the mechanisms by which they attempted to exercise\u000a      control in Kirkuk. The research also presented a range of options whereby\u000a      Kirkuk's inclusion in either Iraq or in Kurdistan could be managed, and\u000a      how the resolution of the question of Kirkuk's territory could be\u000a      separated from the question of Kirkuk's oil reserves.\u000a    The third part of the research programme reflected upon the UK's\u000a      experience in Iraq, with a particular view to involvement, intervention,\u000a      and stabilization. This theme developed in the first instance from\u000a      Stansfield's participation in a Defence Intelligence Staff initiative in\u000a      2002-03, and his subsequent work with a range of senior UK military\u000a      officials from PJHQ and DCDC. The research was further underpinned by the\u000a      awarding of an ESRC grant in 2007 on `British military intervention and\u000a      ethical statecraft' (with Tim Dunne). This work focused on the options\u000a      available to UK military planners to stabilize the situation in Iraq,\u000a      particularly by working with local political actors.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35618","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Ashour's research and fieldwork have led to two key areas of impact:\u000a      informing policy debate through citations in policy documents and\u000a      practice and enhancing public understanding of Islamist issues\u000a      through engagement with the media.\u000a    In March 2009, Ashour informed policy makers by speaking at two\u000a      consultation events organised by the British Foreign and Commonwealth\u000a      Office (FCO). \"Promoting Political Freedoms and Deepening Democracy\"\u000a      and \"Common Security Challenges in the Maghreb and the Sahel\" were\u000a      attended by members of the Cabinet and Home Office and the Department for\u000a      International Development. Following the publication of his book, Ashour\u000a      participated in consultation events with the Ditchley Foundation in\u000a      February 2010, entitled \"Countering Radicalization in Local\u000a        Communities\"; the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (\"Security\u000a        Threats in North Africa\", Rabat, May 2010) and the International\u000a      Association for the Chiefs of Police (\"De-Radicalization Processed and\u000a        Programs\", Paris, May 2010). In the US in 2010, Ashour was invited\u000a      by the RAND Corporation and Carnegie Endowment to contribute to\u000a      consultations with US Government. These resulted in publications of policy\u000a      papers such as De-Radicalizing Islamist Extremists (published by\u000a      RAND) which stated that: \"the only major work on the subject [collective\u000a      de-radicalization] is Omar Ashour's The De-Radicalization of Jihadists.\"\u000a      (p. 188) and Ashour is cited 30 times. Following this. Ashour informed\u000a      policy debate by being cited six times in the US Counter-terrorism White\u000a      Paper on \"Protecting the Homeland from Domestic and International\u000a        Terrorism Threats Current Multi- Disciplinary Perspectives on Root\u000a        Causes, the Role of Ideology, and Programs for Counter- radicalization\u000a        and Disengagement\" (2010).\u000a    As the Arab world began to experience major political transitions, Ashour\u000a      was a constant source of advice. His research was described by United\u000a      Nations' ESCWA as \"extremely important in tailoring realistic and\u000a      context-driven security sector reform recommendations and...serve to\u000a      increase the debate among security sector practitioners in the region and\u000a      press upon Arab governments the need for reform\".\u000a    In March 2011, he was a panellist on three separate occasions at the\u000a      House of Commons: the first organised by the Committee for Democratic\u000a      Libya (\"Libya: The Case for Intervention\"), the second organised\u000a      by the Council for Arab-British Understanding (\"The Fall of the\u000a        Pharaoh: How will it Impact the United Kingdom's Foreign Policy\")\u000a      and, lastly, the Henry Jackson Society (\"Moral Imperatives and\u000a        Strategic Interests &#8212; Western Policy after the Egyptian Revolution\").\u000a      These were attended by MPs, the media, and NGOs like Amnesty\u000a      International, Human Rights Watch, and Medecins Sans Frontieres.\u000a    Ashour argued for intervention in Libya, and for engagement with\u000a      Islamists and former Islamists in Egypt and Libya. In the latter area in\u000a      particular, he influenced FCO philosophy with regard to post- Jihadists\u000a      such as Abd al-Hakim Belhaj, the former head of Tripoli Military Council,\u000a      the LIFG, and the leader of al-Watan Party, whom Ashour had interviewed.\u000a      In March 2011 he presented a paper to the FCO, entitled \"De-Radicalization\u000a        and Civil Resistance in Egypt and Libya\". Since FCO representatives\u000a      and diplomatic and foreign office staff from 15 countries were present,\u000a      Ashour fed into FCO philosophy with regard to former militants and their\u000a      future political role in the country. In May 2011, he was invited by the\u000a      United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI)\u000a      to Lucca, Italy to present to British, European, American and Canadian\u000a      senior security officials on \"Downstream Interventions: Rehabilitation\u000a        and De-radicalization\" during a consultation on Policies to\u000a        Counter the Appeal of Terrorism. FCO, Home and EU counter-terrorism\u000a      coordinator. Gilles De Kerchove, and the head of the United Nation's\u000a      al-Qaida and Taliban Monitoring Team. Richard Barrett, and the other\u000a      officials were present. Ashour has been strongly advocating democracy and\u000a      ending dictatorship in his country of origin, Egypt. After the Egyptian\u000a      revolution in 2011, he was consulted by both the first Egyptian elected\u000a      civilian President in August and September 2012 as well as the National\u000a      Security Committee of Egyptian Parliament in March 2012 on security sector\u000a      reform and transformation of Islamists from armed to unarmed activism,\u000a      with special focus on the Sinai Peninsula. In July 2012, he was asked by\u000a      the British Embassy in Cairo and the FCO to lead a research project on\u000a      countering violent extremism in Egypt, with focus on the Sinai. Between\u000a      November 2012 and September 2013, the FCO invited Ashour to a series of\u000a      discussions on Islamist transitions and security sector reform in Egypt\u000a      and Libya. The meetings were attended by several senior officials\u000a      including, Minister Alastair Burt, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of\u000a      State. Some of the meetings were held under the title of `The Jubilee\u000a      Dialogues,' flagship series of debates organized by the FCO bringing\u000a      together leading thinkers to discuss some of the major drivers behind\u000a      transformation in societies across the world\u000a      (https:\/\/www.wiltonpark.org.uk\/conference\/wp1253\/#conference_introduction).\u000a      On 11 February 2013 the Department for International Development (DFID)\u000a      invited Ashour to speak about de- radicalization and the Arab Awakening.\u000a      Ashour also gave a lecture on the same topic in the Advanced Command and\u000a      Staff Course (ACSC) in Joint Services Command and Staff College. which was\u000a      well-received by military officers from over 20 countries. This was\u000a      organized by the Ministry of Defence on 25 February 2013. He was also\u000a      invited to present his research findings in a roundtable table discussion\u000a      with the British Home Secretary, Theresa May on 1 May 2013. Overall. the\u000a      FCO summarized Dr Ashour's interactions with policy-makers: \"an excellent\u000a      example of how long-term academic research and a sustained investment in a\u000a      relationship between governmental policymakers and academics can reap\u000a      benefits in a fluid and changing situation such as that of the `Arab\u000a      Spring'.\"\u000a    In addition to informing policy debate, Ashour has raised the level of\u000a      public debate and understanding of de-radicalization through his media\u000a      engagement. He was interviewed over 400 times only during 2011\/13 by\u000a      various media outlets, both in the UK and abroad. Examples include the BBC\u000a      6 O'Clock News; \"Impact\" on BBC World News with Tim Willcox;\u000a      Channel 4 News; BBC News Hour with Lyce Doucet, the 6.30 ITV News; CNN;\u000a      Al-Jazeera (both English &amp; Arabic); France 24; Russia Today and\u000a      others. A key theme was the recognition that the opposition movements\u000a      bringing about change were inevitably going to include Islamist and\u000a      post-Islamist activists who have been de-radicalised, which developed\u000a      directly out of Ashour's research. He has been quoted extensively in\u000a      newspapers, including the Guardian (7 times during 2011\/12); Financial\u000a      Times; Daily Telegraph; Times; Washington Post; Gulf Times; and Al-Ahram\u000a      (Egypt). After the July 2013 coup in Egypt, The Observer ran an article\u000a      by Ashour opposing Tony Blair's view on the opposite page that the\u000a      military will bring democracy in Egypt and that the West should back the\u000a      new regime. His expert contribution was described by al-Jazeera Network as\u000a      \"highly valued both by our organization and the audience\" and his analysis\u000a      of the evolving situation in the Middle East was described as follows:\u000a      \"widely contributed to educate our [al-Jazeera's] global audience.\"\u000a    He also appeared in the Doha Debates in April 2011, contributing to a\u000a      discussion aimed at raising public awareness on whether Arabs, not NATO,\u000a      should be dealing with Libya. The Doha debates openly discuss Middle East\u000a      issues and are broadcast by BBC World News eight times a year. The total\u000a      potential global audience for The Debates is over 350 million.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The rise in Islamist armed activism has led to de-radicalization being\u000a      seen as a major means of preventing terrorism, alongside classic security\u000a      and counter-terrorism tactics. Since 2008, Dr Omar Ashour, from the\u000a      University of Exeter, has emerged as a leading expert on de-radicalization\u000a      and transitions from armed to unarmed activism, advising governments (e.g.\u000a      UK, Canada. Netherlands), intergovernmental organisations (e.g. UN and EU)\u000a      and NGOs. His research has informed policy-makers and debate, and\u000a      contributed to developing initiatives in de-radicalization. both inside\u000a      and outside of the Muslim world. His extensive media involvement has raised\u000a        the level of public debate and public understanding both within the\u000a      UK and internationally.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Exeter\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Exeter (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Exeter","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007792}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2538475","Name":"Rabat"},{"GeoNamesId":"2988507","Name":"Paris"},{"GeoNamesId":"360630","Name":"Cairo"}],"References":"\u000a    Research Publications\u000a    \u000a1.

Following his\u000a      appointment as Lecturer in the Politics of the Modern Arab World at the\u000a      University of Exeter in 2008, Dr Omar Ashour continued his research in\u000a      this area, resulting in his major monograph, \"The De-Radicalization of\u000a        Jihadists\", in 2009, published by ORutledge in their prestigious\u000a      series Critical Studies in Terrorism. It was the first study of\u000a      its kind. It was based on frontline fieldwork, including interviews with\u000a      jihadist leaders, mid-ranking commanders, and young sympathizers, as well\u000a      as former security and intelligence officers and state officials in Egypt.\u000a      Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Canada and the United Kingdom. In it, Ashour\u000a      delineated the factors which cause armed Islamist movements to\u000a      de-radicalize, ideologically, behaviourally and organizationally. Chris\u000a      Mcmillan summarizes the book in his review in International Affairs: \"Ashour\u000a      manages to provide a highly detailed, very well-presented analysis of how\u000a      and why several of the most important armed Islamist movements over the\u000a      last 70 years have successfully sought to fundamentally alter their\u000a      ideology, behaviour and structure and why this has been unattainable for\u000a      others.\" The book provided the first analysis of the de-radicalization\u000a      processes of the Egyptian Muslim Brothers (1951-1973), subsequent former\u000a      allies of al-Qa'ida (including al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya and al-Jihad\u000a      Organization) and more recent Algerian Islamist groups (1997-2008). Ashour\u000a      used mainly social movement theory to analyse how state policies (the main\u000a      focus was on security bureaucracies), charismatic leadership, and social\u000a      interaction with secular groups can all interact to shape the prospects\u000a      for de-radicalization and participation in pluralist, democratic politics.\u000a      The book received excellent reviews by renowned experts in the field\u000a      published in prestigious journals such as World Politics (reviewed\u000a      by Professor Jillian Schwedler) and Perspectives on Politics\u000a      (reviewed by Dr Thomas Hegghammer). Ashour's analysis of the practical\u000a      mechanisms of de-radicalization, investigating both individual cases and\u000a      collective movement shifts to non-violence, was presented in \"Post-Jihadism:\u000a        Libya and the Global Transformation of Armed Islamist Movements\"\u000a      (July 2011).\u000a    Ashour expanded his research to include other countries and regions\u000a      (Gaza, Tunisia, Netherlands and Singapore), the transitions from militia\u000a      to party politics by Islamists and the limitation of risks and security\u000a      threats (cf. \"Hamas and the Prospects of De-Radicalization\"). He\u000a      completed additional fieldwork in Libya in March 2010 and August 2011,\u000a      with a focus on the transformation of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group\u000a      (LIFG) and its interactions with al-Qaddafi's regime. In March 2010, the\u000a      LIFG reconciled with the Qaddafi regime and officially abandoned and\u000a      de-legitimized armed tactics. The plan was to reintegrate its members in\u000a      the society and possibly in some of the official institutions. But the\u000a      LIFG joined the armed revolution against the Libyan dictator, and its\u000a      commanders spearheaded the attack on his headquarters in August 2011.\u000a      However, after the removal of Qaddafi, the LIFG transformed into party and\u000a      electoral politics. (cf.\"Libyan Islamists Unpacked: Rise,\u000a      Transformation, and Future).\u000a    One major finding from Ashour's fieldwork was the development of the\u000a      notion of \"Post-Jihadism\". encompassing former jihadists who, after\u000a      reflecting on their experience, seek alternative non-violent means for\u000a      socio-political change, and adopt ideological and theological stances to\u000a      legitimate those means. Case studies for the research on this, carried out\u000a      between 2009 and 2012 were drawn from Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia,\u000a      Iraq, and Yemen. (cf. \"Post-Jihadism and Ideological\u000a        De-Radicalization.\"). The focus of this research was twofold: the\u000a      theological and the ideological dimensions of de-radicalization (as\u000a      opposed to the behavioural and the organizational dimensions outlined in\u000a      his earlier book), and the impact of these transformations on\u000a      democratisation and the persistence of authoritarianism in the Middle East\u000a      and North Africa. Another major finding pertains to the persistence of the\u000a      transitions. Ashour argues that these transitions cannot persist unless\u000a      there is a comprehensive process of security sector reform and balanced\u000a      civil-military relations (cf \"Post-Jihadism: Libya and the Global\u000a      Transformation of Armed Islamist Movements;\" cf \"From Bad Cop to Good Cop:\u000a      The Challenge of Security Sector Reform in Egypt).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36921","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Creation of an innovative forum for stakeholder dialogue and policy\u000a        influence\u000a      GRAMNet brings together 40 member organisations ranging from\u000a      community-based groups, local\u000a      authorities and campaign groups to large NGOs, such as: Scottish Refugee\u000a      Council, the Black and\u000a      Ethnic Minority Infrastructure Scotland (BEMIS), Glasgow Housing\u000a      Association, Oxfam Scotland\u000a      and British Red Cross. In this way, GRAMNet has successfully shaped the\u000a      form and content of\u000a      association between these different civil society organisations and\u000a      practitioner groups.\u000a    This partnership approach has resulted in a strong suite of funded\u000a      projects that link researchers\u000a      with these practitioner organisations (&#163;5M in research income from 2009 to\u000a      31 July 2013),\u000a      demonstrating the effectiveness of the network in achieving a broad level\u000a      of participation and the\u000a      generation of research based evidence for policy and practice across the\u000a      UK. GRAMNet was\u000a      specifically recognised as an example of university research delivering\u000a      benefit to humanity and\u000a      society by the Research Councils UK and Universities UK in its 2011\u000a      publication entitled `Big Ideas'\u000a      [1]. The overlapping relationship between GRAMNet and TREEC has also led\u000a      to joint initiatives\u000a      between the networks which have resulted in substantial impact during the\u000a      review period. These\u000a      include the following:\u000a    (i) Sanctuary, Safety and Solidarity: Enhancing service delivery for\u000a        marginalised groups\u000a      In collaboration with BEMIS and the Equality Network, TREEC and GRAMNet\u000a      members, including\u000a      Dr. Francesca Stella, investigated the barriers facing LGBT asylum seekers\u000a      in Scotland, under an\u000a      Equality and Human Rights Commission funded project between June 2010 and\u000a      March 2011.\u000a      Stella co-authored the joint research report Sanctuary, Safety and\u000a        Solidarity: Lesbian, Gay,\u000a        Bisexual, Transgender Asylum Seekers and Refugees in Scotland [2].\u000a      The report was shared\u000a      through events organised by the Equality Network to practitioners from\u000a      public and third sector\u000a      organisations working with asylum seekers, including the Glasgow Housing\u000a      Association. It was\u000a      subsequently used by the Equality Network when designing training on LGBT\u000a      issues for\u000a      practitioners and service providers in the voluntary and third sector; the\u000a      Equality Network uses the\u000a      report in bespoke training as well as making it readily available online\u000a      as a training resource [3].\u000a    The report is cited by, for example, the\u000a          Metropolitan Migration Foundation (pg43) and LGBTory,\u000a        the Conservative LGBT Group\u000a      (pg9). It was also presented to practitioners and academics in the\u000a      Netherlands examining similar issues as part of the Fleeing\u000a        Homophobia Project, funded by the\u000a      European Refugee Fund, the Dutch Ministry of Justice and other\u000a      organisations. The report was\u000a      featured and circulated by public bodies and organisations beyond\u000a      Scotland, such as the Wales\u000a          Strategic Migration Partnership\u000a      (pg2) whose membership extends to the Welsh Government, the\u000a      Welsh Association of Assistant Chief Police Officers, and the UK Border\u000a      Agency Regional Director.\u000a    (ii) Social and Cultural Impacts of Migration: Influencing policy\u000a        debates and developments\u000a      GRAMNet and CRCEES form an important contributing force in the Convention\u000a      of Scottish Local\u000a      Authorities (CoSLA) Strategic Migration Partnership (CSMP). Kay undertook\u000a      research with the\u000a      CSMP in 2012 which considered the social and cultural impacts of migration\u000a      in Glasgow and\u000a      involved interviews with stakeholders from organisations and services\u000a      having regular contact with,\u000a      or consideration of, issues relating to migration [4]. The Policy Manager\u000a      at CSMP notes that the\u000a      project `informed policy debates at local, regional and national\u000a        level'.\u000a    Kay and Flynn also participate in the CSMP Board, which involves senior\u000a      officer representation\u000a      from local, Scottish and UK Government and various partners in the public\u000a      and voluntary sector.\u000a      The Policy Manager also expressed the positive contribution that GRAMNet\u000a      and CRCEES make to\u000a      the work and forward planning of the CSMP through their input to the\u000a      Board, which is `...invaluable\u000a        as we seek to develop a coherent strategic approach to migration policy\u000a        matters'. Going on to\u000a      more specifically outline collaborative initiatives with GRAMNet, he\u000a      states that they `...have greatly\u000a        enhanced our evidence base in relation to the social and cultural\u000a        impacts of migration'. This joint\u000a      work, he notes, has included a collaborative Masters project with the CSMP\u000a      on the impact of\u000a      migrant children in Glasgow schools. This included a placement for the\u000a      student at the CSMP\u000a      during which he converted his academic thesis into a policy paper, shared\u000a      with the Glasgow City\u000a      Council and CSMP's other partners in local government and beyond [5].\u000a    (iii) Future Memory in Red Road: Challenging imaginations through\u000a        creation of cultural\u000a        capital\u000a      GRAMNet and TREEC research fed directly into a series of public engagement\u000a      events and\u000a      activities around the translation, performance and memorialisation of\u000a      different cultures in Scotland.\u000a      In particular, Glasgow researchers led initiatives commemorating the\u000a      iconic Red Road flats in\u000a      Glasgow prior to the start of their demolition in May 2013. The high-rises\u000a      were used to house\u000a      asylum seekers dispersed to Glasgow by the Westminster Government. Glasgow\u000a      accommodates\u000a      the largest concentration of refugee and asylum seekers in the UK outside\u000a      of London. Designed in\u000a      1962 as a cost-effective solution to problems of overcrowding, the Red\u000a      Road Flats were a\u000a      landmark in the city skyline for over 50 years before their removal began\u000a      as part of a social\u000a      housing regeneration programme. By the time demolition plans were\u000a      announced in 2005, the flats\u000a      had become synonymous with poverty and deprivation.\u000a    Future Memory in Red Road was part of a larger project, `Red Road\u000a      Flats: Past, Present, Future',\u000a      which sought to collect and preserve stories, cultural artefacts and\u000a      commentary from the flats for\u000a      the future. It brought TREEC and GRAMNet researchers together with another\u000a      AHRC-funded\u000a      initiative, `Future Memory in Place', organised through the\u000a      University of Exeter (Dr. Elena Isayev;\u000a      and artists Catrin Webster and Marion Woods). Both projects used\u000a      collaborations with artists to\u000a      engage communities in the production and communication of research\u000a      findings.\u000a    The University of Glasgow's unique contribution was driven by research\u000a      expertise in constructions\u000a      of `home' and place-making and living with insecurity developed by Flynn\u000a      and Kay, respectively; as\u000a      well as the public engagement and knowledge transfer expertise which Kay,\u000a      Flynn, Oldfield and\u000a      Phipps brought from their lead roles in TREEC and GRAMNet. Current and\u000a      former residents'\u000a      portraits and life stories were collected, many of which featured in the\u000a      Red Road Flats: Past,\u000a      Present and Future exhibition at the People's Palace Museum in Glasgow.\u000a      The exhibition opened\u000a      in February 2013 and will run for one year. In 2012-13 the People's Palace\u000a      Museum attracted over\u000a      310,000 visitors, demonstrating the reach that the Red Road exhibition\u000a      will continue to have during\u000a      the rest of its run [6]. Glasgow Life &#8212; the City Council's main cultural\u000a      and heritage body &#8212; will then\u000a      archive the artefacts to memorialise the Red Road Flats and inform the\u000a      public about their history\u000a      and significance.\u000a    Future Memory in Red Road culminated in an innovative public\u000a      performance organised by\u000a      GRAMNet, TREEC and colleagues from the Future Memory in Place initiative\u000a      on 18 May 2013. A\u000a      community choir performed the oral histories of the Flats' residents,\u000a      transposed into music, to a\u000a      gathering of approximately 500 people and against a backdrop of portraits\u000a      of residents and former\u000a      residents. The vibrant performance allowed the translation and expression\u000a      of multiple narratives\u000a      from changing populations of migrant and non-migrant groups, challenging\u000a      public perceptions of\u000a      life at the Red Road Flats. Other events in the project included an\u000a      archaeological site survey at the\u000a      Flats as well as a programme of oral histories developed by Stella and\u000a      Swain (Professor, CEES,\u000a      2006-present) with pupils of St. Martha's Primary School, located beside\u000a      the Red Road Flats [7].\u000a    In a related initiative the team also developed the theme of home and\u000a      migration through a series of\u000a      workshops involving pupils from five secondary schools in Glasgow,\u000a      exploring how students from\u000a      diverse cultural backgrounds expressed their understanding of place and\u000a      home through creative\u000a      forms. The team subsequently developed the project with two of the\u000a      secondary schools,\u000a      (Shawlands Academy and Govan High School), by helping students produce a\u000a      photography\u000a      exhibition of their work and a short animated film in which they discussed\u000a      their experiences of the\u000a      project. The exhibition was curated by Street Level Photoworks and\u000a      displayed at the University of\u000a      Glasgow in December 2012, with the launch event attracting approximately\u000a      100 guests.\u000a    Thus, by cultivating relationships with policy-makers, practitioners and\u000a      other stakeholders,\u000a      Glasgow researchers have used their research to influence refugee, asylum\u000a      and migration policy\u000a      and practice in Scotland and beyond.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Glasgow research has contributed to the founding and\u000a      development of two unique\u000a      research networks, the Glasgow Refugee, Asylum and Migration Network\u000a      (GRAMNet) and\u000a      Translating Russian and East European Cultures (TREEC), creating new,\u000a      innovative forums for\u000a      dialogue and influence on refugee, asylum and migration policy across\u000a      Scotland and beyond.

Kay found that the male crisis was\u000a      particularly evident in the\u000a      communities in post-Soviet Russia where she undertook ethnographic\u000a      research. Key insights from\u000a      this research also revealed the various responses to the crisis by\u000a      policy-makers and those involved\u000a      in the delivery of social services [1, 4, 6]. This body of research\u000a      explored issues of economic,\u000a      cultural and social (in)security and identity, which are important issues\u000a      for migrant experience.\u000a    Dr. Francesca Stella (Research Fellow, 2013-present; Lecturer 2007-12)\u000a      also investigated gender\u000a      issues in her work on LGBT communities in Russia in urban and provincial\u000a      locations and the\u000a      construction and meaning of queer space. She examined the tactics used to\u000a      carve out communal\u000a      space to question ethnocentric assumptions about the empowering potential\u000a      of visibility [5].\u000a    Dr. Moya Flynn (Senior Lecturer, 2006-present; Lecturer, 2002-06) also\u000a      addressed the issue of the\u000a      `post-Soviet experience' in her research on the construction of `home' and\u000a      `homeland' by members\u000a      of ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking communities from the former Soviet\u000a      republics who\u000a      returned to the Russian Federation after the collapse of the USSR. Flynn\u000a      demonstrated that\u000a      interacting factors such as kin and its continuity over generations and\u000a      attachment to the land; a\u000a      sense of socio-economic and socio-political security; and social networks\u000a      of family and friends all\u000a      influence a sense of self and identity as they change over space and time.\u000a      More generally, Flynn's\u000a      research findings provided a deeper understanding of what underpins\u000a      changing attachments to\u000a      place, which is also an important factor when examining migrant's\u000a      experiences [2, 3].\u000a    Flynn and Kay collaborated with Dr. Jon Oldfield (Senior Lecturer,\u000a      University of Glasgow, 2007-present,\u000a      previously University of Birmingham) and colleagues at Queen Mary,\u000a      University of London\u000a      and the University of Westminster to organise an Economic and Social\u000a      Research Council (ESRC)\u000a      Seminar Series on `Trans-National Approaches to Locally Situated Concerns:\u000a      Theoretical and\u000a      Practical Insights from Russia, CEE and the UK' from 2003-04. When\u000a      Oldfield joined the University\u000a      of Glasgow in January 2007, he edited (with Kay and Flynn) a collection of\u000a      papers from the\u000a      seminar series, published in 2008 [1]. A key finding of this research is\u000a      the importance of dialogue\u000a      between academics, policymakers and communities.\u000a    Their research into the Post-Soviet experience, combined with insights\u000a      from the ESRC Seminar\u000a      Series and resultant book, were pivotal in driving forward two subsequent\u000a      research initiatives: the\u000a      Glasgow Refugee, Asylum and Migration Network (GRAMNet); and Translating\u000a      Russian and East\u000a      European Cultures (TREEC).\u000a    GRAMNet: Kay co-founded GRAMNet with Professor Alison\u000a      Phipps (Professor of Languages and\u000a      Intercultural Studies, 2007-present; Senior Lecturer, 1995-2006) in 2009.\u000a      Phipps brought expertise\u000a      from her extensive research into languages, intercultural communication,\u000a      and issues affecting\u000a      refugee and asylum communities in the UK and abroad, whilst Kay made a\u000a      distinct and material\u000a      contribution through her research expertise of working with migrant groups\u000a      and non-academic\u000a      communities in Russia and the UK.\u000a    Kay and Phipps established GRAMNet on the basis of their cumulative\u000a      research findings which\u000a      showed that creating a collaborative flow of information between academics\u000a      and `frontline'\u000a      practitioners is key to understanding, addressing and advocating for\u000a      issues around migration,\u000a      asylum and refugees. GRAMNet acts as forum for academics, activists,\u000a      service providers and\u000a      policy makers to work together around issues of asylum and migration to\u000a      make a vital contribution\u000a      to the lives and experiences of these different migrant groups.\u000a    TREEC: In 2011, Oldfield (PI), with Kay, Flynn and others\u000a      established TREEC, along with\u000a      colleagues from other institutions, to explore the social and cultural\u000a      impacts of Central and East\u000a      European migration into Scotland and the UK. This programme reflected the\u000a      methodological\u000a      outcomes of their research, stressing engagement with non-academic\u000a      partners. The network was\u000a      funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and operated\u000a      through the Centre for\u000a      Russian Central and East European Studies (CRCEES), led by the University\u000a      of Glasgow. The\u000a      researchers investigated multiple ways in which Russian and East European\u000a      cultures are\u000a      translated, constructed and narrated through social, cultural and artistic\u000a      encounters.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36977","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"783754","Name":"Albania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"},{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"718075","Name":"Macedonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3277605","Name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3194884","Name":"Montenegro"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has impacted on religious\/convictional organisations in\u000d\u000a      dialogue with European\u000d\u000a      institutions at both national and supranational levels by raising\u000d\u000a      awareness and understanding of\u000d\u000a      the role of `religion' and `faith' as follows:\u000d\u000a    4.1 Religious Organisations in the European Union\u000d\u000a    The project led to Dr Leustean organising a two day international\u000d\u000a      practitioner conference at the\u000d\u000a      Aston Centre for Europe (November 2010) which examined religious\u000d\u000a      representations in the\u000d\u000a      European Union and the United States (s5.1).

The projects formed part of Dr. Copsey's ongoing research\u000d\u000a      into the nature of power and influence within the European Union.\u000d\u000a    The aim of the research was to investigate the influence of Poland on the\u000d\u000a      European Union's policy towards its eastern neighbours. In doing so, the\u000d\u000a      research offered an improved understanding both of how EU policy towards\u000d\u000a      Russia, Ukraine and Belarus is made (s3.1, s3.2, s3.4, s3.5), as well as\u000d\u000a      how the relationship between the European Union and its member states is\u000d\u000a      evolving (s3.1, s3.2, s3.4). Poland was found to have been significant in\u000d\u000a      shaping the EU's policy towards these neighbouring states (s3.1). The\u000d\u000a      research findings drove analysis of the impact of EU membership forwards,\u000d\u000a      moving beyond traditional investigation of the concept of\u000d\u000a      \"Europeanisation\", the downward impact of the EU on its members, offering\u000d\u000a      insights through the study of the \"inside-out\" relationship, that is, the\u000d\u000a      influence of any member state on the EU (s3.1, s3.2, s3.4). This\u000d\u000a      perspective had largely been missing from previous research on the\u000d\u000a      governance of the European Union.\u000d\u000a    Addressing this deficiency in analysis of the EU, this research developed\u000d\u000a      a new understanding of the impact of a recent member country, Poland, on\u000d\u000a      the development of European Union policy. In doing so, it adopted an\u000d\u000a      innovative, intergovernmental approach, assessing the capacity of the\u000d\u000a      Polish national government to exercise political leadership within the\u000d\u000a      European Union. This analysis shed light on the neglected research area of\u000d\u000a      what determines a Member State's capacity to exercise power and influence\u000d\u000a      in the European Union.\u000d\u000a    The research determined (s3.1, s3.2, s3.4, s3.5,) that the ability of a\u000d\u000a      given country to exercise influence in the EU is shaped by both fixed\u000d\u000a      factors, primarily economic strength and population size, and by a range\u000d\u000a      of variable factors. In more detail, these include: the intensity with\u000d\u000a      which a member state holds a given policy preference (s3.1, s3.4); skill\u000d\u000a      at alliance building, at political and senior administrative levels (s3.1,\u000d\u000a      s3.4); administrative capacity to engage with the European policy-making\u000d\u000a      machinery (s3.1, s3.4); persuasive advocacy (s3.1, s3.4); the\u000d\u000a      receptiveness of other member states to policy proposals (s3.1, s3.4); and\u000d\u000a      the domestic political strength of an incumbent national government (s3.1,\u000d\u000a      s3.4)\u000d\u000a    These findings illustrated that whilst individual governments have little\u000d\u000a      capacity to change fixed factors, they can improve influence by addressing\u000d\u000a      these variable factors. Further research on Polish EU membership with\u000d\u000a      regard to other policy fields, found that two factors in particular could\u000d\u000a      be addressed as a means to advance national influence within the EU's\u000d\u000a      governance framework, namely: administrative capacity: this includes\u000d\u000a      institutional design, co-ordination between line ministries, quality of\u000d\u000a      personnel, professionalism (s3.1); and skills in strategic, long-term\u000d\u000a      alliance building (s3.4).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37291","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Raising Norse Spirits project is part of the CNS ethos of community\u000a      engagement and\u000a      Knowledge Exchange and represents an innovative collaboration between a\u000a      university cultural\u000a      studies research centre and a commercial business. Highland Park\u000a      distillers had originally\u000a      considered the name \"Valhalla Collection\" for a new collection of\u000a      whiskies, but had not really\u000a      explored how to direct this idea or which gods, characters or symbols to\u000a      use. While they had\u000a      gathered some basic information, it soon became clear to them that they\u000a      required considerably\u000a      more. In view of this, the company sought to engage with the CNS to\u000a      provide research-based\u000a      advice and guidance with respect to their plans. This initial engagement\u000a      has flourished\u000a      subsequently into a strong partnership. In our initial role, we were able\u000a      to confirm that much of the\u000a      information originally secured by the company was actually inaccurate. We\u000a      went on to provide\u000a      guidance on the choice of relevant figures, e.g. starting with \"Thor\", who\u000a      was more generally\u000a      worshipped in settlement areas like Orkney and had a more drink specific\u000a      back story, than \"Odin\",\u000a      the king of the Norse gods, who was seen as an altogether more remote and\u000a      ambiguous figure.\u000a      \"Freya\" was also chosen to reflect the particular importance the Norse\u000a      gave to their womenfolk.\u000a    However, the underpinning research into the mythology of the Norse Gods\u000a      and their surrounding\u000a      stories and legend went significantly beyond the issue of selecting\u000a      suitable candidates for the\u000a      special collections and extended to the point where the Centre was able to\u000a      advise Highland Park\u000a      distillers on the colour and character of the whiskies that should be\u000a      produced. Hence \"Thor\" is an\u000a      earthy, robust, very vivid whisky in keeping with Thor's status as son of\u000a      Earth and uncomplicated\u000a      hero of the Aesir whereas \"Loki\" is darker and more complex in character\u000a      as befits the archetypal\u000a      Norse mischief maker. The whiskies that are being produced for the final 2\u000a      Gods in the current\u000a      series are being similarly designed and promoted, under the advice of the\u000a      Centre. There has also\u000a      been close working with respect to the design, presentation and packaging\u000a      of the bottles, and the\u000a      motifs embossed on them, which have once again been specially created to\u000a      reflect the true\u000a      character and symbols of the Gods the whiskies represent.\u000a    The team therefore acted as research advisors for brand development,\u000a      product packaging design,\u000a      labelling, packaging and the website, for which the team have provided\u000a      content and games &#8212; engaging\u000a      customers not only in the product but the heritage of the Scottish island\u000a      on which it is\u000a      made, and giving Orkney's Nordic heritage an international reach.\u000a    The success of the range has been so great that the company is continuing\u000a      its engagement with\u000a      the Centre in an even closer relationship, and there is exploration\u000a      underway of options for new\u000a      whiskies using other characters and symbols from Norse mythology and life,\u000a      derived from the\u000a      Centre's research.\u000a    The product has attracted a high degree of global interest and \"Thor\" won\u000a      an IWSC Gold Award in\u000a      2012.

This\u000a      opened up new marketing areas to target such as Russia, which was founded\u000a      by the\u000a      Norse.\u000a    d) The background information has also been used to create concomitant\u000a      products such as\u000a      drinking glasses and to provide the information and character profiles\u000a      required by the\u000a      customers, including the supernatural aspects of the featured gods.\u000a    \u000a      The development of knowledge exchange mechanisms to allow Highland\u000a        Park personnel at a\u000a        number of levels to access the information we have provided.

The\u000a      importance of interdisciplinary research, allied to community ownership\u000a      and community\u000a      involvement is central to the ethos and the strategic aims of CNS.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37311","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The project represents an innovative collaboration between a university\u000a      cultural studies research\u000a      centre and a commercial business which aimed to address a gap in the\u000a      skills market for Orkney's\u000a      cruise industry &#8212; developing language qualified tour guides. This was in\u000a      response to research\u000a      conducted on behalf of, and in collaboration with, Orkney Islands Council,\u000a      Orkney Harbours, and\u000a      Cruise Orkney.\u000a    This programme was aimed at addressing a shortage of qualified tourist\u000a      guides who can explain\u000a      the cultural context of Orkney in a range of languages so that visitors\u000a      from all over the world can\u000a      have the full benefit from their visit and carry away lasting memories.\u000a      Many tourists visiting the\u000a      region have very limited or no English language skills, especially those\u000a      that are in the region for\u000a      short periods of time such as those arriving on cruise liners. There is a\u000a      growing and increasingly\u000a      lucrative market for multilingual tour guides to enhance the Orkney\u000a      experience. Orkney Harbours'\u000a      Michael Morrison noted \"This intensive course provided a much needed\u000a      requirement for languaged\u000a      guides for the cruise industry and for Orkney tourism generally.\" (Source:\u000a      Letter from Orkney\u000a      Harbours).The main source of revenue for tourism operators on Orkney is in\u000a      fact tours from cruise\u000a      liners. The major loss of revenue occasioned by tourists preferring to\u000a      spend their money on a trip\u000a      at another port which provided a language guide was a fundamental blow at\u000a      the sustainability of\u000a      the industry and also affected retailers, craftspeople etc who relied on\u000a      the cruise liner spend.\u000a    The programme encouraged local people to see tourism and cultural\u000a      heritage as providing career\u000a      opportunities. It presented cultural heritage to local and tourist alike\u000a      in a new and integrative\u000a      manner and improved the understanding of cultural heritage as having\u000a      economic benefits and\u000a      thereby improving employment opportunities. Communities need to be able to\u000a      create and manage\u000a      their own cultural capital and to be empowered by an understanding of and\u000a      value for what they\u000a      have and the products thereof. There is a clear relationship between\u000a      knowledge and power and\u000a      our research agenda has allowed us to help the communities to make the\u000a      leap from the theoretical\u000a      to the practical, and indeed the practicable, use of their lived\u000a      experience.\u000a    The course started in March 2010 and the first 11 students graduated in\u000a      October 2010 in English,\u000a      Spanish, French, German, Swedish and Polish. Bookings for 2010 and 2011\u000a      increased as a direct\u000a      result of this course which was repeated in 2012 with 17 graduates and\u000a      will run in Shetland in\u000a      2013. The first iteration was only available in Orkney. The second\u000a      iteration was also placed online\u000a      and attracted students from all over Scotland as well as in Orkney. The\u000a      sessions were recorded\u000a      and this allowed existing guides to undertake a recognised CPD opportunity\u000a      by accessing topics\u000a      and lectures of specific value to them. This was clearly successful.\u000a      Orkney Harbours have pledged\u000a      to finance any further courses (source: letter from Orkney Harbours).CNS\u000a      has been asked by\u000a      STGA to run a similar course in Shetland in 2013 and STGA have discussed\u000a      the possibility of\u000a      running the course in the Western Isles in 2014. STGA have also requested\u000a      resources for a\u000a      Scotland wide Blue Badge (higher level) course to run from 2014.\u000a    This project had impact in the following areas:\u000a    \u000a      Economic prosperity. We applied our research to creating a course\u000a        leading to job\u000a        opportunities that were not previously available and which contributed\u000a        to the economic\u000a        prosperity of the Orkney community. We also safeguarded jobs attached to\u000a        the cruise\u000a        industry and income streams for local businesses which would have been\u000a        severely affected\u000a        by a downturn in business. This was a major stimulus to the tourist\u000a        experience in Orkney\u000a        and will impact on Shetland and the Western Isles in the years to come.\u000a      Cultural life. We interpreted cultural capital to create a sustainable\u000a        resource with community\u000a        ownership. We preserved and presented cultural heritage in a new,\u000a        enriching, and\u000a        interactive way which was considered excellent in every way by the\u000a        stakeholders and\u000a        clients.\u000a      Education. This was a unique education opportunity with economic and\u000a        social inclusion\u000a        benefits for lifelong learners.\u000a      There was also measurable impact on other cultural sectors, eg.\u000a        Archaeology as fully\u000a        trained tour guides were available to interpret the sectors and maximise\u000a        tourist experience.\u000a        Impact was therefore economic, social, and experiential. Indicators for\u000a        this include the\u000a        following:\u000a    \u000a    The funding received from Orkney Harbours for both iterations of the\u000a      course was given as it was\u000a      deemed of crucial significance to the cruise industry in Orkney. Kirkwall\u000a      was named the best British\u000a      port of call in the 2010 UK cruise industry awards, and the islands as a\u000a      whole were voted the UK's\u000a      top destination for cruise liners in 2010 and 2011. Kirkwall came second\u000a      in the international cruise\u000a      industry awards in 2013.\u000a    74 cruise ships booked to visit the islands during 2012. Those booked for\u000a      2012 had a combined\u000a      gross tonnage of 1.6 million tonnes and together will have 43,000\u000a      passengers. 2013 was shaping\u000a      up as a bumper year, with Princess Cruises making three additional\u000a      bookings involving 3599\u000a      passengers each time, bringing the total to 78 liners booked with 61579\u000a      passengers in total.\u000a    Disembarkation figures 2009-2012 (source: Orkney Harbours)\u000a      2009: 26,978\u000a    2010: 25,464\u000a    2011: 29,875\u000a    2012: 41,563\u000a    From these figures, it can be seen that the disembarkation numbers were\u000a      declining until 2010 and\u000a      increased incrementally after 2010 when the first tranche of fully trained\u000a      guides were available.\u000a      This increase was directly linked to the availability of such guides\u000a      (source: Orkney Harbours)\u000a      Impacts in Orkney from tour guide work generated by the first course,\u000a      including induced impacts,\u000a      are estimated at 7 ftes (11 in head count) and &#163;140,000 in income.

CNS\u000a      itself as a research\u000a      group has been in operation since 2006. The underpinning research ethos of\u000a      CNS is the use of\u000a      research for cultural projects which contribute to the sustainability of\u000a      the communities it serves.\u000a      Being located in the communities themselves has given us a unique\u000a      perspective and an impetus to\u000a      apply our research to create cultural capital. This research has been able\u000a      to enhance\u000a      understanding of the unique cultural and (pre)historical offerings to\u000a      international tourists within the\u000a      Northern Isles of Scotland. Research has enhanced knowledge and\u000a      understanding and the\u000a      associated dissemination of this research has identified international\u000a      interest in the lay public. We\u000a      were also able to provide a unique linguistic aspect to the programme -\u000a      staff are either native\u000a      speakers or very fluent in nine languages including Swedish, Norwegian,\u000a      German, Gaelic, Greek,\u000a      and French.\u000a    We used our interdisciplinary research and insight into the lived\u000a      experience of the island\u000a      communities, past, present, and future, combined with research into\u000a      minority languages and\u000a      literature, archaeology, and applied pedagogical research into networked\u000a      learning (such as that\u000a      found in Heddle's publication: `Multimedia blended network learning: A\u000a      Culture Studies case study',\u000a      DIVERSE, 2006, which was instrumental in Heddle being awarded a THES award\u000a      for Most\u000a      Imaginative Use of Distance Learning in 2005) to create the programme\u000a      materials and the teaching\u000a      pedagogy which allowed us to create new opportunities for economic\u000a      prosperity in the cultural and\u000a      tourism sectors. This was in line with our research that revealed the need\u000a      for the guides and what\u000a      those guides would need to know about Orkney, its culture and heritage, in\u000a      order to operate\u000a      successfully. We refined the programme academically and pedagogically\u000a      between each iteration\u000a      and extended its scope and range of CPD opportunities. The Scottish Tour\u000a      Guiding Association\u000a      described the programme as \"invaluable, innovative, and exciting\". It is a\u000a      100 hour guiding and\u000a      language course aimed at improving and adding to the guide cohort in\u000a      Orkney which was also\u000a      available through technology across Scotland. We therefore influenced STGA\u000a      policy and practice\u000a      nationally in creating and delivering this type of course and have been\u000a      asked to create a Scotland-\u000a      wide multimedia version in 2014.\u000a    The programme itself runs over 6 months covering both practical and\u000a      taught sessions to develop\u000a      Tour Guiding skills to the Green Badge award level. Taught sessions are\u000a      Part I of the course, and\u000a      students may progress to Part II, the practical guiding sessions where\u000a      they also undertake\u000a      language assessments. All students graduated in more than one language\u000a      with the majority\u000a      choosing German as the need for German speaking guides was considered most\u000a      acute by our\u000a      stakeholders in the cruise industry. Other languages covered were French,\u000a      Spanish, English,\u000a      Polish, and Swedish.\u000a    Students learned about Orkney covering amongst other things; language\u000a      (based on research\u000a      outputs noted at references 2 and 3 below), literature, cultural history\u000a      (based on research outputs\u000a      noted at references 1-4 below), geology, climate, pre-history, art and\u000a      architecture, mythology,\u000a      historical figures, social demographics (based on research outputs 1-4\u000a      below), leisure recreation,\u000a      entertainment and sports.

This is to be followed up by another radio talk show in\u000d\u000a        Hausa, organised by the Kano partners, in which popular questions and\u000d\u000a        concerns relating to the project topic will be discussed.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Influencing teaching programmes and equality\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The project has impacted on capacity building, skills training and\u000d\u000a        widening participation in the partner HEI. Building on previous\u000d\u000a        collaboration which led to the creation of a new MSc in land development\u000d\u000a        at Bayero University in the 1980s, it has set up capacity building\u000d\u000a          and skills training programmes for young researchers based on\u000d\u000a        collaborative participation in practical project activities, starting in\u000d\u000a        2010. It thus ensures further, sustained impact on local livelihoods and\u000d\u000a        resource management in future, particularly as a gender-balanced,\u000d\u000a        field-work trained, community conscious cohort of young researchers\u000d\u000a        progresses through the ranks. This capacity building element has been\u000d\u000a        integrated into existing undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in\u000d\u000a        the Department of Geography from 2011, helping reorientate teaching\u000d\u000a        towards a community-focused and experience-rich approach. This is\u000d\u000a        reflected in a new natural resource focus in a completely revamped MSc\u000d\u000a        programme launched in 2012.\u000d\u000a      The project has paid particular attention to building capacity among women\u000a          students, with the result that the project team and activities\u000d\u000a        include female academic staff and undergraduate and postgraduate\u000d\u000a        students. Statistical evidence of female participation rates is\u000d\u000a        available, and questionnaires distributed to a sample of female\u000d\u000a        researchers and subjects indicate high field participation rates for\u000d\u000a        women, as researchers, research assistants, students and subjects.

The 1990s research\u000d\u000a      took up the findings of an earlier United Nations University (UNU)\u000d\u000a      research project (1980-7), to which RC-C was also a key contributor, which\u000d\u000a      had for the first time challenged the prevailing assumption that dense\u000d\u000a      population clusters in semi-arid zones always impact negatively on\u000d\u000a      surrounding areas through fuel consumption. The UNU research group had\u000d\u000a      shown that in the area around Kano, Nigeria, local people spontaneously\u000d\u000a      developed strategies for conservation &#8212; planting trees, exchanging\u000d\u000a      seedlings &#8212; and maintained these over long periods. However, it was\u000d\u000a      thought that the Kano case might have been an exception. RC-C's research\u000d\u000a      after 1993, drawing on his findings for a major consultancy commissioned\u000d\u000a      by the Federal Government of Nigeria, showed decisively that this was not\u000d\u000a      the case. Across Northern Nigeria, local populations tried to balance\u000d\u000a      fuelwood production and use with vegetation conservation (see output R1\u000d\u000a      below). RC-C's continuing research therefore emphasised the need for\u000d\u000a      long-term monitoring of trends in vegetation structure and composition,\u000d\u000a      and for the incorporation of local perspectives on vegetation protection\u000d\u000a      and use. This led to official adoption of decentralised farm forestry.\u000d\u000a      However, local forestry officials still retained a top-down and\u000d\u000a      protectionist approach while paying lip service to decentralisation. In a\u000d\u000a      key article (R2) RC-C argued for genuine local participation. He\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the value of a long historical perspective in an article\u000d\u000a      which revealed the existence of popular woodland and tree management\u000d\u000a      practices even in the straitened circumstances of the Second World War\u000d\u000a      (R3). In subsequent work RC-C explored the linked themes of knowledge\u000d\u000a      creation and normalisation in firewood studies and changing discourses\u000d\u000a      surrounding woodfuel production, use and change into the 21st century\u000d\u000a      (R4-R5).\u000d\u000a    This research has been influential worldwide. It has been taken up as a\u000d\u000a      key point of comparison in work on Peru (Maxwell, Human Ecology 39 (4)\u000d\u000a      2011:465-78), Botswana (van der Horst &amp; Hovorka, Biomass and Bioenergy\u000d\u000a      33 (11) 2009:1605-16), Mali (Benjaminsen, Geoforum 24 (4) 1993:397-409;\u000d\u000a      Hautdidier, B&#251;cherons et dynamiques institutionelles locales au Mali,\u000d\u000a      PhD thesis ISIVE Paris 2007), and across West Africa (Woodwell, Fuelwood\u000a        and Land Use in West Africa: report for International Resources\u000d\u000a      Group, Washington DC 2002) and discussed in a Global Assessment Report by\u000d\u000a      the International Union of Forest Research Organisations (2010).\u000d\u000a    The project which underpins the impact case study builds upon and is made\u000d\u000a      possible by this preceding body of research. Funded by Development\u000d\u000a      Partnerships in Higher Education (DelPHE) and begun in 2010, it responds\u000d\u000a      to the call for long-term monitoring by revisiting Kano sites to establish\u000d\u000a      the extent of more recent changes. Using a mix of qualitative and\u000d\u000a      quantitative research methods (interviews, vegetation surveys, focus group\u000d\u000a      discussions, participatory research assessment, participant observation),\u000d\u000a      it has discovered a more complex picture than earlier predicted (R6). Some\u000d\u000a      outlying areas around Kano that formerly did not protect vegetation are\u000d\u000a      now beginning to do so, while some of the near farmland areas are losing\u000d\u000a      vegetation at a sometimes rapid rate. It has shown that official energy\u000d\u000a      policy in Northern Nigeria will have to address firewood issues directly\u000d\u000a      rather than treating firewood as a residual source of energy due to be\u000d\u000a      superseded by modern energy sources. Wood energy use is not declining: it\u000d\u000a      is diversifying. A recent development has been the increasing use of\u000d\u000a      charcoal, a more convenient fuel for urban domestic use which, like\u000d\u000a      firewood, comes from woody vegetation. However, neither this fuel shift\u000d\u000a      nor its policy implications registered immediately on government radar.\u000d\u000a      This shows the importance of the project's investment in (a) long-term\u000d\u000a      monitoring and (b) bringing forestry officials\/ government policy makers\u000d\u000a      into dialogue with researchers and local fuel users to ensure the\u000d\u000a      strategies and perceptions of the latter are taken fully into account.\u000d\u000a    Reg Cline-Cole (Senior Lecturer) has been based at the Centre for West\u000d\u000a      African Studies at the University of Birmingham since 1992.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38882","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nolte's research has made a difference to the way in which UK and other\u000a      policy makers in various fields perceive the relationship between conflict\u000a      and religious, political and social difference in Nigeria. On the basis of\u000a      her research, Nolte has been invited to discuss her findings with policy\u000a      makers in the UK, USA and Europe, making a difference to\u000a      development-related policy-making, the FCO and case-by-case decisions by\u000a      the Home Office.\u000a    Engagement with International Diplomatic and Policy Professionals\u000a      Questions of religious and political conflict in Nigeria are high on the\u000a      agenda of policy makers and overseas development agencies, but insightful\u000a      interpretations of what is going on at the level of everyday life are\u000a      rare. The impact of Nolte's work is evidenced by the fact that she has\u000a      been invited on several occasions to share her findings at high-profile\u000a      events bringing together scholarly, diplomatic and policy-oriented\u000a      audiences at EU institutions in Brussels, the Ditchley Foundation, Oxford,\u000a      and the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), Washington, where\u000a      she presented her findings on \"Religion, Politics and Governance in\u000a      Nigeria\" (April 2010) to an audience of Washington-based policy-makers.\u000a      She discussed her insights on Nigerian politics and her understanding of\u000a      vigilante activities (2007, 2008, 2009) with policy-makers and diplomats\u000a      during a Conference on 1-3 October 2009 on \"The Prospects for Nigeria\" by\u000a      the Ditchley Foundation (see source 1 below). Nolte was also invited to\u000a      Brussels to give a keynote lecture to the European Union Election\u000a      Observation Mission to Nigeria in March 2011. Her \"considerable expertise\u000a      and understanding of Nigeria's socio-political environment\" was considered\u000a      by the organisers to \"help the observers to both understand the context of\u000a      the elections and to ensure their safety during the mission (Source 2). In\u000a      November 2012, Nolte was also invited to a briefing at the Foreign and\u000a      Commonwealth Office (FCO) to share her understanding of political styles\u000a      and alliances in Southwest Nigeria (2013) with the then High\u000a      Commissioner-elect, Dr Andrew Pocock. Her presentation and briefing paper\u000a      assisted \"[the FCO's] understanding of some of the dynamics within\u000a      opposition politics as well as some [of] the political challenges\u000a      President Jonathan is going to face\" (Source 3).\u000a    Impact on Development-Related Policy-Making\u000a      Nolte's research has had a particular impact on development-related\u000a      policy-making. A draft report on Nolte's work on the agency of women in\u000a      the OPC vigilante organization (published 2008) challenged views of women\u000a      as passive victims of civil disorder. At the time, the director of the\u000a      Heinrich Boell Foundation Nigeria \"immediately gave the submitted article\u000a      to [the organisation's] programme officer responsible for the conflict\u000a      management programme\" in order to develop this aspect of the\u000a      organization's work. He advised that it was \"high time\" that her research\u000a      be distributed among \"international institutions\" and \"conflict management\u000a      practitioners.\" (Source 4). Nolte's follow-on work on \"Religion, Politics\u000a      and Governance in Nigeria\" (2010) contributed to research funded by a\u000a      government organisation (DfID) in 2005-2010 because it critically examined\u000a      the contributions of faith-based development organizations to development.\u000a      In response to interest from scholars, representatives of DfID and other\u000a      development practitioners, extracts from the Working Paper focusing on the\u000a      conditions most likely to support productive inter-religious activity were\u000a      later published as the Research Programme's Policy Brief No. 7 (Source 5).\u000a      In 2012, Nolte's understanding of how religious and political debates\u000a      affected wider dynamics such as the passing of Nigeria's Petroleum\u000a      Industries Bill also helped to \"inform [...] policies under the FCO's\u000a      prosperity agenda\" (Source 3).\u000a    Contributing to UK-based Business\/ Professional Risk Analysis\u000a      Since 2011, Nolte has maintained regular contact with the West Africa Desk\u000a      of the London-based risk management firm Control Risks. As a \"valuable\u000a      contact\" for the company, Nolte's \"additional insights\" into political\u000a      developments in Nigeria have helped the company to \"improve the quality of\u000a      its analysis and opinion\" (Source 2).\u000a    Supporting Refugee Decision-Making in the UK and Beyond\u000a      Based on her understanding of social, political and religious dynamics in\u000a      Nigeria, Nolte has provided regular expert advice on Nigerian cases to\u000a      charities and lawyers working to support asylum seekers and other migrants\u000a      in the UK. She has provided formal reports to a range of international\u000a      organizations. An individual report for the US-based Seton Hall Center for\u000a      Social Justice was considered by a US judge to \"establish\" a client's\u000a      claim (Source 6). Information provided on a Nigerian organisation is cited\u000a      at length by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada as a basis for\u000a      its own decision-making (Source 7). In the UK, Nolte has worked as a\u000a      Nigeria country adviser to Refugee and Migrant Justice (RMJ) between 2005\u000a      and 2010, and the Refugee Legal Centre (RLC) since 2008. Nolte's reports\u000a      have assisted the Home Office in making appropriate case-by-case decisions\u000a      and have been praised by a judge (Source 8).\u000a    Public Engagement\u000a      The resonance of the research for the Nigerian knowledge-community was\u000a      demonstrated by the strong interest and response attracted by her book\u000a      (item 3 above) from the Nigerian public in the UK, Nigeria and elsewhere.\u000a      Attendance at the London launch on 6 October 2009, sponsored jointly by\u000a      the International African Institute and the Nigeria-based Obafemi Awolowo\u000a      Foundation, included academics, Nigerian expatriates and prominent\u000a      politicians such as Governor Gbenga Daniel (Ogun State, Nigeria), who\u000a      referred to Nolte's work as \"an exceptional book\" (Source 9). The launch\u000a      of the Nigerian edition, on 28 July 2011 at the Nigerian Institute of\u000a      International Affairs (NIIA) in Lagos, attracted academics, members of the\u000a      business community, politicians and traditional rulers, including the most\u000a      senior traditional ruler of Yorubaland, HRH Oba Okunade Sijuwade II, the\u000a      Ooni of Ife. In the Nigerian context, the impact of the book was further\u000a      illustrated by the fact that its \"chief launcher,\" the entrepreneur Tutu\u000a      Braimo, paid over USD 6,000 for the first copy (Source 10). The popular\u000a      interest in the book was also confirmed by several reviews in Nigerian\u000a      newspapers, with a reviewer in the Nigerian Compass arguing on 9 May 2012\u000a      that it was \"outstanding\" and well deserving of \"the accolades it is\u000a      currently receiving among Nigerian intelligentsia\" (Source 11).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    It is often assumed in media and policy discourses that difference &#8212;\u000a      especially religious difference - automatically leads to conflict.

Under the\u000a      leadership of Insa Nolte, a senior lecturer in the department, the\u000a      research has been interdisciplinary, drawing on ethnographic knowledge of\u000a      Yoruba practices, historical research and an interdisciplinary engagement\u000a      with theoretical literature beyond the remit of anthropology.\u000a    Nolte's work focuses on the importance of everyday experiences and\u000a      relationships for the formation of Yoruba and Nigerian political\u000a      identities. The central insights of her work focus on:\u000a    I. The importance of everyday encounters in wider contexts\u000a      Nolte's work on Yoruba history and politics (Publications R1 and R3;\u000a      Grants A, C, D, E) criticizes especially the narrow definitions of the\u000a      public in contemporary debates on African societies. It has been\u000a      significant in confirming the importance of everyday participation in\u000a      public affairs for wider historical, social and political developments.\u000a    II. The historical and social constitutedness of Yoruba identities\u000a      Nolte's research on the formation of Yoruba identities (Publications\u000a      R3-R5; Grants A, C, D, E) explores social identity as contextual and thus\u000a      always potentially political. The emphasis on the historical trajectories\u000a      of important forms of social identity constitutes an important theoretical\u000a      element of her work.\u000a    III. Practices centring on Islam, Christianity and traditional\u000a        religion in southwest Nigeria\u000a      Nolte's examination of the landscape of intense religious competition in\u000a      Nigeria (Publication R2; Grants A, B) has illustrated that Yoruba Muslims,\u000a      Christians and traditionalists often work and live closely together, and\u000a      that the incidence of direct religious conflict among them is lower than\u000a      in other religiously heterogeneous parts of Nigeria. This points to the\u000a      importance of the private and everyday for the understanding of religious\u000a      conflict as well as tolerance. Overall, Nolte's work emphasises the\u000a      importance of everyday experiences and interpersonal relationships for the\u000a      political process. It shows that while conflict can create and exacerbate\u000a      difference, difference is not automatically a cause of conflict. It\u000a      therefore offers an understanding of social, political and religious\u000a      dynamics in Nigeria which breaks away from the common assumption -\u000a      prevalent in the media &#8212; that difference is always the root cause of\u000a      conflict. Instead, it shows the importance of a detailed understanding of\u000a      how people work out interpersonal relationships on the ground in specific\u000a      contexts.\u000a    For this reason, it is of interest beyond academia not only to Nigerian\u000a      stakeholder groups, but also to policy-makers, diplomats, businesses,\u000a      development practitioners and religious leaders.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40125","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    CPI research into the integration of migrant workers has influenced\u000a      policy, practice and a wide range of stakeholders in both \"sending\" and\u000a      \"receiving\" communities. A model of global citizenship, facilitated by\u000a      university engagement and student volunteers, has proved a key element in\u000a      empowering Chinese migrant workers and has been described by Merlene\u000a      Emerson, co-founder of the Chinese Liberal Democrats, as a model for\u000a      similar schemes nationwide.\u000a    The effectiveness of the model was first demonstrated following Wu's\u000a      initial study of workers in Veneto's textile, garment and leather\u000a      industries. In 2006 just six Chinese migrants had registered with the\u000a      Health Service of Padova's \"Spazio Ascolto\" programme. By 2008 this figure\u000a      had risen by at least 1,400 per cent as a result of a project involving\u000a      student volunteers and local health officials. Professor Valter Zanin, of\u000a      Padova University, has since noted \"a marked transformation in the way the\u000a      Chinese community regards and engages with local facilities and\u000a      resources\". [a]\u000a    The success of this project was instrumental in a decision by the\u000a      International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the University of Nottingham\u000a      (UoN) to co-host a high-profile round-table workshop in Nottingham in\u000a      October 2009 [b]. The event attracted 80 participants, including\u000a      representatives of the International Organisation for Migration, UK\u000a      government agencies (Home Office, UK Border Agency, UK Human Trafficking\u000a      Centre, Gangmasters' Licensing Authority), the Chinese Embassy, NGOs,\u000a      Chinese entrepreneurs and community organisations, academics and student\u000a      delegates. This directly resulted in the development of a number of\u000a      initiatives to encourage the greater integration of the Chinese community\u000a      in Nottingham, chief among them the establishment of a student volunteer\u000a      support network [c].\u000a    Operating under a variety of names (Nottingham Student Network for\u000a      Chinese Migrants, Nowe Community International and Nottingham Chinese\u000a      Support Network), the network incorporates a training programme that\u000a      between 2011 and 2012 alone instructed more than 300 UoN students, both\u000a      Chinese and non-Chinese, in practising global citizenship in collaboration\u000a      with local stakeholders. Merlene Emerson has remarked: \"There is often a\u000a      divide between the local community and the student body, and where foreign\u000a      students are involved the gap is even wider. Dr Wu's programme has not\u000a      only succeeded in bridging that gap but has also managed to tap into the\u000a      student body to be an added resource for the local community.\" [d]\u000a    Alongside the network, the workshop also led to the founding of the\u000a      Nottingham Chinese Forum, a regular round-table meeting between three\u000a      local councils (Nottingham City, Nottinghamshire County and Broxtowe\u000a      Borough), NGOs (Voluntary Action Broxtowe), Chinese community\u000a      representatives, university staff and student volunteers. The\u000a      contributions made by both the network and the forum have been widely\u000a      acknowledged by local stakeholders.\u000a    Broxtowe Borough Council, for example, has described the initiatives\u000a      resulting from Wu's research as \"essential in developing both policy and\u000a      service provision for the council and its partners\". The authority has\u000a      drawn on the network and the forum to help the borough's large Chinese\u000a      community with issues such as citizens' rights, access to health and\u000a      education services, community safety and business advice. Richard Lea, the\u000a      council's Communities Team Leader, has observed: \"We have gained a better\u000a      understanding of the community and now know why some of our earlier\u000a      attempts to engage were not successful.\" [e]\u000a    Nottingham City Homes (NCH), which manages around 10,000 council\u000a      properties, has used the network's student volunteers to give\u000a      presentations on Chinese culture to residents and to support its own\u000a      Universal Roots project, which aims to raise cultural awareness generally.\u000a      V. Bryce, NCH's Equality and Diversity Manager, has described the project\u000a      as \"of great value\" and a significant factor in NCH achieving its equality\u000a      and diversity objectives. [f] Student volunteers also regularly visit\u000a      Nottingham Chinese School, whose headmaster, Dr Xuezhong Sun, has praised\u000a      the initiative as \"of enormous benefit\" and for giving \"fresh and\u000a      substantial impetus to efforts to bring together the disparate elements of\u000a      communities for the purpose of development and integration\". [g]\u000a    Wu's work has also been used in China. In April 2010 the International\u000a      Organisation for Migration (IOM) invited Wu to Shenyang to give a lecture\u000a      to more than 200 government migrant management officials. In 2010 and 2011\u000a      Wu also addressed local and national branches of the State Council's\u000a      Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and central government, including the\u000a      Ministers of Personnel and Science and Technology. Kieran Gorman-Best,\u000a      Project Manager for IOM's EU- China Capacity-Building for Migrant\u000a      Management (CCBM) programme, has credited Wu with \"greatly enhancing\"\u000a      Chinese officials' appreciation of migrant workers' problems and for\u000a      improving IOM's own ability to \"respond to these issues in an ever more\u000a      sympathetic, productive and effective manner\". [h] Wu also facilitated a\u000a      meeting between IOM and senior Overseas Chinese Affairs Office officials,\u000a      resulting in the latter's key involvement in the CCBM programme.

Compared\u000a      with the rich information and data about migrant workers in China itself,\u000a      \"on the ground\" studies outside China are rare. As a result little is\u000a      known the specific difficulties Chinese migrant workers face overseas and\u000a      the possible solutions to their problems.\u000a    Led by Dr Bin Wu, research by the China Policy Institute (CPI) at the\u000a      SCCS has sought to address this gap by using field observation and\u000a      in-depth interviews to examine the working conditions of Chinese migrants\u000a      and so illustrate their broader social isolation and vulnerability. This\u000a      evolved into the notion of developing university-community partnerships\u000a      and training and mobilising student volunteers, thereby helping to\u000a      overcome longstanding failings in support provision.\u000a    The research began with a project centred on several Chinese-owned\u000a      factories in the textile, garment and leather industries in Veneto, Italy.\u000a      Wu co-devised the study and carried out much of the fieldwork. In 2008 the\u000a      findings revealed the poor working conditions and consequent health\u000a      concerns of the Chinese migrants who made up the vast majority of the\u000a      factories' workforces. The plight of the workers was analysed in the\u000a      context of their social isolation and their lack of meaningful\u000a      communication and interaction with mainstream society and community\u000a      organisations [1, 2]. Wu and his co-authors made a number of key\u000a      recommendations, including regular round- table discussions geared towards\u000a      Chinese communities' development in significant host countries; university\u000a      engagement with Chinese communities; encouraging academics and students to\u000a      participate in relevant initiatives; and the establishing of a dedicated\u000a      Chinese immigration forum to bring together policymakers, scholars, the\u000a      leaders of Chinese communities and other stakeholders.\u000a    In 2009, taking forward the findings from this initial research, Wu\u000a      embarked on a project commissioned by the International Labour\u000a      Organisation. The aim was to investigate Chinese migrant workers'\u000a      relationships with co-ethnic employers and to develop a deeper\u000a      understanding of the factors &#8212; beyond poor language skills &#8212; contributing\u000a      to their social isolation. Field observations and interviews were\u000a      conducted, this time in UK Chinese restaurants and takeaways and\u000a      traditional Chinese medicine shops. The evidence shed new light on the\u000a      extent to which employers subjected legal and illegal migrant workers to\u000a      various kinds of exploitation, abuse and coerced labour [3].\u000a    Both projects demonstrated the social isolation of Chinese migrant\u000a      workers in Europe could not be understood in the absence of a detailed\u000a      appreciation of diasporic Chinese communities' structural deficiencies.\u000a      Among the crucial factors revealed were segmentation and segregation; weak\u000a      ties with host societies in tandem with strong ties with sending\u000a      communities; and power struggles within Chinese entrepreneurial\/community\u000a      organisations without workers' participation [4].\u000a    Alongside these concerns, a possible impetus for change was consistently\u000a      highlighted by the research. This led to the concept of Overseas Chinese\u000a      Community Building, through which university engagement could help bring\u000a      together multiple stakeholders in collaborative efforts to empower Chinese\u000a      migrant workers via community development and integration [5].\u000a    Key Researcher: Bin Wu is a Senior Research Fellow of the CPI, at\u000a      the SCCS since 2007.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40126","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The SCCS has greatly enhanced the understanding of China's post-reform\u000a      rise beyond academia.

[the] issues concerning\u000a      us most in the policymaking process\" and her \"highly valued... innovative\u000a      suggestions\" [a].\u000a    Yao's research on inter-regional inequalities and housing has\u000a      significantly influenced the work of China's National Bureau of Statistics\u000a      (NBS). Since 2007 and throughout the impact period a key element of NBS's\u000a      Urban Household Survey has been Yao's recommendation to include in its\u000a      data rural migrant households that have lived in cities for more than six\u000a      months, so offering a more accurate picture of the true urban situation.\u000a      In August 2010 NBS Commissioner Ma Jiantang and a team of senior officials\u000a      visited Nottingham to seek Yao's views on how to calculate and publish\u000a      various coefficients related to inequalities, as a result of which it was\u000a      agreed to implement his recommendations for at least a decade. Wang\u000a      Youjuan, Deputy Director General of NBS's Department of Household Surveys,\u000a      has acknowledged Yao's \"direct and powerful impact on the decision-making\u000a      process in China\", with his ideas used \"to write our policy reviews for\u000a      the Chinese Government\" [b].\u000a    In September 2011, in recognition of his work on China's economic growth\u000a      and banking sector, Yao was invited to meet Vice Premier Wang Qishan,\u000a      People's Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuang and various ministers\u000a      responsible for economic affairs. Although confidentiality considerations\u000a      mean full details of the meeting cannot be disclosed, the then Chinese\u000a      Consul General in Manchester, Ni Jian, who facilitated the meeting, has\u000a      confirmed Yao's views on exchange-rate policy and its potential role in\u000a      continued economic growth were \"taken seriously by Chinese leaders and the\u000a      People's Bank\"[c]. From 2008 to 2011 Yao also gave twice-yearly lectures\u000a      to Ni's staff. Ni, now China's Ambassador to Iraq, has confirmed he has\u000a      subsequently \"adopted some of his [Yao's] ideas when we [the Chinese\u000a      government] deal with investment and trade issues between China and the UK\u000a      and between China and the Middle East\" [c].\u000a    Yao has also contributed to policy debates via his collaborations with\u000a      the Institute of Science and Technological Information of China (ISTIC).\u000a      Attached to the Ministry of Science and Technology, ISTIC has drawn on his\u000a      work in areas including economic growth, trade and investments and income\u000a      distribution. Zhao Zhiyun, ISTIC's Vice-President and also Secretary\u000a      General of the Association of Soft Science of China (ASSC), has observed:\u000a      \"[Yao's] work has helped the efficiency of Chinese public policy, senior\u000a      management... and other key stakeholders across China.\" In 2012 ASSC\u000a      appointed Yao an Honorary Special Adviser [d].\u000a    SCCS has also helped develop China's next generation of policymakers.\u000a      Since 2009 more than 50 mid-ranking officials from the Communist Youth\u000a      League have received training as part of the CPI's annual Chevening\u000a      Training Programme led by Yao. Han Liqun, Vice-President of the All- China\u000a      Youth Federation of Hebei Province, who led one of the teams trained at\u000a      the School, acknowledged that the programme had \"critically changed our\u000a      thinking and decision-making\", particularly in poverty alleviation &#8212; drawn\u000a      from Song's work &#8212; and also in energy efficiency and pollution reduction\u000a      in Hebei [e].\u000a    SCCS's expertise on economic development is now being employed in other\u000a      countries. In December 2012 the UK's Department for International\u000a      Development (DFID) asked Song to apply her methodologies and insights to\u000a      Africa with a view to filling \"significant gaps in our understanding of\u000a      the role of policy to stimulate growth in low-income countries\". This\u000a      resulted in Song designing a number of dedicated projects to determine the\u000a      lessons Africa might learn from the successes and failures of China's\u000a      development policies [f]. In May 2011 both Song and Yao were also\u000a      appointed Key Experts for the EU-China Research and Academic Network, a\u000a      &#8364;2.5m European External Action Service project whose input is regularly\u000a      referenced in the EU's China-related policies [g].\u000a    An outreach campaign has communicated SCCS's economic research to a\u000a      broader audience. Yao's blog [h], first launched in April 2010 by\u000a      Beijing-based finance and economics publication Caijing, has now attracted\u000a      more than a million hits and has been joined by blogs for mainstream\u000a      websites such as Sohu, Sina, Ifeng and NetEase. Feedback shows how these\u000a      efforts have informed grass-roots perceptions. According to Han Yao's blog\u000a      has \"helped many people understand the current challenges, constraints and\u000a      opportunities faced by China for its social and economic development\" [e].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Nottingham's School of Contemporary Chinese Studies\u000a      (SCCS) has, through its China Policy Institute (CPI), been at the\u000a      forefront of explaining the crucial lessons of China's journey towards\u000a      economic superpower status.

Research by the SCCS has\u000a      aimed to lead the way in chronicling and interpreting this remarkable rise\u000a      to help policymakers, officials and other stakeholders grasp the valuable\u000a      lessons of a transition of genuinely global significance.\u000a    To provide an alternative to the study of China via traditional Sinology\u000a      by using social sciences methodologies to study contemporary concerns was\u000a      the raison d'etre behind the founding of the School in 2007. Related\u000a      strands of research led by Professor Lina Song, who specialised in labour\u000a      economics and poverty alleviation, and Professor Shujie Yao, who focused\u000a      on macro-economics and finance, have complemented each other in impacting\u000a      upon policymaking in China.\u000a    Song joined the University in 1999 to further her earlier research into\u000a      the disparities arising from China's economic revolution. Her first book\u000a      on the subject, The Rural-Urban Divide, examined the enduring gulf between\u000a      China's urban and rural populations in terms of income, education,\u000a      healthcare and housing [1]. She established that fiscal decentralisation\u000a      had resulted in a greater dispersal of power, heightening the potential\u000a      for policies reflecting different economic interests, and that many\u000a      official strategies deliberately favoured the urban population to guard\u000a      against its latent political power.\u000a    Subsequent research expanded on these themes by investigating the\u000a      evolution of China's labour market, focusing on issues such as increased\u000a      workforce mobility, changes in the distribution and structure of wages and\u000a      the growth of rural migration. Assessing the obstacles to its success,\u000a      Song warned China's labour market would remain \"imperfect and incomplete\"\u000a      in the absence of further enterprise and social reforms. Much of this work\u000a      was summarised in the award-winning book \"Towards a Labour Market in\u000a      China\" [2]. More recently, in research published in 2010, Song explored\u000a      long-term trends in the country's levels of urban poverty, concluding that\u000a      they had fallen almost entirely as a result of economic growth rather than\u000a      government anti-poverty programmes [3].\u000a    The global financial crisis that began in 2007 opened up important new\u000a      avenues of research, with Yao among the first to explain how the turmoil\u000a      in the West accelerated China's ascent. A series of publications between\u000a      2007 and 2009 addressed the key issues of China's rise as an economic\u000a      superpower and the need to reduce inter-regional inequalities through the\u000a      strategic deployment of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the creation\u000a      of new \"growth engines\". Significantly, Yao demonstrated that FDI itself\u000a      should not be blamed for rising inequalities: rather, its uneven\u000a      distribution was responsible for increasing disparities between regions\u000a      [4].\u000a    Building on his work on the threats and opportunities facing China in a\u000a      post-crisis landscape, in 2009 Yao conducted a detailed comparison of the\u000a      Chinese and American housing markets to determine the likelihood of China\u000a      suffering a US-style crash. This research highlighted the risk posed by\u000a      the relative underdevelopment of China's financial system, especially in\u000a      terms of credit monitoring and asset securitisation [5]. Extending this\u000a      theme, in 2011 he assessed the health of the country's state-owned banks,\u000a      highlighting how restructuring into shareholding companies could improve\u000a      both technical efficiency and scale economies but warning that risk\u000a      management would need to be improved to deal with a volatile business\u000a      environment [6].\u000a    Key Researchers:\u000a    Shujie Yao is Professor of Economics and Chinese Sustainable\u000a      Development and Head of SCCS since 2007.\u000a    Lina Song is Professor of Economic Sociology and Chinese Studies\u000a      at the School of Sociology and Policy (2002-12) and at SCCS since 2012,\u000a      both at the University of Nottingham.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40127","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    CPI has become a highly valued source of analysis and advice for those\u000d\u000a      tasked with shaping\u000d\u000a      policy and opinion in relation to China.

Drawing on his\u000d\u000a      work on China's relations\u000d\u000a      with its near neighbours and foreign powers, Tsang helped revise The\u000d\u000a      Elders' tactical approach in\u000d\u000a      terms of political engagement and other strategic concerns.

For instance, since 2008 Wang has presented his\u000d\u000a      research at more than 30\u000d\u000a      symposia, colloquia, and workshops, many of them in China, including at\u000d\u000a      the Zhou Enlai School of\u000d\u000a      Government (Tianjin, April 2008), the International Conference on\u000d\u000a      Legitimacy and Governance\u000d\u000a      (Shanghai, July 2010) and the Chinese Views of the EU Conference (Beijing,\u000d\u000a      October 2011).\u000d\u000a    The media's understanding about Chinese political culture has been\u000d\u000a      enhanced through CPI's\u000d\u000a      intense programme of awareness-raising.

The CPI at the SCCS has been at the forefront of efforts\u000d\u000a      to test longstanding and\u000d\u000a      simplistic notions about the politics and governance of this emerging\u000d\u000a      superpower and so\u000d\u000a      encourage mutually beneficial relations between China and those with whom\u000d\u000a      it engages.\u000d\u000a    Research by Professor Steve Tsang has addressed a major geopolitical\u000d\u000a      consideration, China's\u000d\u000a      relations with its near neighbours. Building on earlier work at the\u000d\u000a      University of Oxford, where he\u000d\u000a      introduced the analytical framework \"consultative Leninism\" for studying\u000d\u000a      contemporary Chinese\u000d\u000a      politics, Tsang has produced a number of leading studies on Taiwan, its\u000d\u000a      democratic politics and\u000d\u000a      the social, economic and emotional significance of its historical and\u000d\u000a      practical links to mainland\u000d\u000a      China. Arguing that democratic Taiwan is \"the most authentic inheritor of\u000d\u000a      China's Confucian\u000d\u000a      tradition\", much of this work was cohered in 2012's The Vitality of\u000d\u000a        Taiwan: Politics, Economics,\u000d\u000a        Society and Culture [1]. By examining the politics of Mainland China\u000d\u000a      and Taiwan side by side, his\u000d\u000a      work has enabled scholars to understand what political practices in China\u000d\u000a      are inherited from the\u000d\u000a      Chinese political traditions, in contrast to those from the\u000d\u000a      Marxist-Leninist tradition.\u000d\u000a    Incorporating several of these themes, Tsang has been at the forefront in\u000d\u000a      explaining the drivers\u000d\u000a      behind the triangular relations between China, Taiwan and the West,\u000d\u000a      particularly the US.\u000d\u000a      Suggesting that many conventional views on the subject are misconceived,\u000d\u000a      his most recent\u000d\u000a      research on this issue, published in 2012, examined the US's assessment of\u000d\u000a      the threat of a Taiwan\u000d\u000a      Strait crisis and provided a \"realistic framework\" for assessing and\u000d\u000a      minimising the risk of a military\u000d\u000a      confrontation [2]. In tandem, work by Dr Hongyi Lai has critically\u000d\u000a      examined China's growing\u000d\u000a      tendency towards \"soft power\", especially in terms of foreign policy\u000d\u000a      discourse and cultural\u000d\u000a      diplomacy, in pursuit of cultivating its international image and a\u000d\u000a      \"peaceful rise\" [3].\u000d\u000a    Another concern uppermost in many policymakers' minds is what political\u000d\u000a      changes will follow\u000d\u000a      China's economic ascent. CPI has investigated China's governance to shed\u000d\u000a      light on the true extent\u000d\u000a      of the disparity between dramatic economic opening and resistance to\u000d\u000a      change in the political\u000d\u000a      system, as well as the influence of internal and external factors on\u000d\u000a      policy. Research published by\u000d\u000a      Lai in 2010 warned the state's \"pro-growth authoritarianism\", despite vast\u000d\u000a      economic benefits and\u000d\u000a      poverty reduction, could actually raise levels of social protest by paying\u000d\u000a      insufficient attention to\u000d\u000a      citizens' rights and discontent [4] and that domestic considerations &#8212; for\u000d\u000a      example, preserving Party\u000d\u000a      rule &#8212; may have a more profound effect on China's policies than widely\u000d\u000a      appreciated.\u000d\u000a    Studies by Dr Zhengxu Wang (Senior Research Fellow, 2007-2012; Associate\u000d\u000a      Professor, 2012-present)\u000d\u000a      have addressed another question central to the long-term strategic\u000d\u000a      thinking of\u000d\u000a      policymakers worldwide: will China become a democracy?

Those reforms contributed to final impacts during the assessment\u000d\u000a      period in several ways.\u000d\u000a    More resources for universities: between 2007-8 and 2011-12,\u000d\u000a      tuition fee income at English\u000d\u000a      universities from home and EU undergraduates increased by 53%, from &#163;2.65\u000d\u000a      billion to &#163;4.05\u000d\u000a      billion (HESA data). Taxpayer support for teaching remained broadly\u000d\u000a      constant; thus the income\u000d\u000a      from fees was a net addition to university resources.\u000d\u000a    Increased student support: the reforms increased the value of\u000d\u000a      maintenance loans, extended\u000d\u000a      loans to cover fees and re-introduced student grants. Between 2007\/8 and\u000d\u000a      2011\/12 the number of\u000d\u000a      awards of financial support to English-domiciled students rose by nearly\u000d\u000a      20%, from 836,000\u000d\u000a      students to over 1 million; spending on student loans rose by 50%, from\u000d\u000a      &#163;3.97 billion to &#163;6 billion,\u000d\u000a      and on grants by 57%, from &#163;1 billion to &#163;1.57 billion [A, Tables 2a, 2b;\u000d\u000a      B, Table 2].\u000d\u000a    More students: increased resources facilitated expansion of the\u000d\u000a      system. The number of new\u000d\u000a      English-domiciled entrants between 17 and 30 years old into higher\u000d\u000a      education rose by 16%, from\u000d\u000a      294,000 in 2007\/08 to 342,000 in 2011\/12, [C, Table 1].\u000d\u000a    Wider participation: the reforms were associated with an increase\u000d\u000a      in applications from people in\u000d\u000a      the most disadvantaged areas, from 13.8% of the cohort in 2008 to 18.4% in\u000d\u000a      2012, an increase of\u000d\u000a      33% [D, Fig. 6 and underlying data]. Given the range of surrounding\u000d\u000a      reforms (e.g. the Literacy and\u000d\u000a      Numeracy Hours, Education Maintenance Allowances and AimHigher), the\u000d\u000a      evidence does not\u000d\u000a      allow a claim that the reforms led causally to improved participation, but\u000d\u000a      supports the claim that\u000d\u000a      they were part of a strategically-designed package which was consistent\u000d\u000a      with wider participation.\u000d\u000a    Reforms in 2012 included raising the interest rate on student loans. By\u000d\u000a      reducing the fiscal cost of\u000d\u000a      loans, this reform is a fundamental element in a strategy to expand\u000d\u000a      student numbers and thus to\u000d\u000a      increase investment in skills; increased numbers also particularly benefit\u000d\u000a      students from\u000d\u000a      disadvantaged backgrounds.

His\u000d\u000a      influence was acknowledged by Tony Blair when Prime Minister [G],\u000d\u000a      including `thanks and\u000d\u000a      appreciation for the outstanding contribution you made to the debate on\u000d\u000a      our higher education\u000d\u000a      reforms. The maturity of the debate ... owed a great deal to your media\u000d\u000a      presentations, and all the\u000d\u000a      painstaking work on which they were based.' The contribution to the\u000d\u000a      interest rate element in loan\u000d\u000a      design was acknowledged in a letter from Dr Vincent Cable, Secretary of\u000d\u000a      State for Business,\u000d\u000a      Innovation and Skills to the editor of the Financial Times (5 July\u000d\u000a      2011), stating that `[Martin] Wolf\u000d\u000a      rightly praises Prof Nick Barr's ideas, which have influenced our\u000d\u000a      thinking. For example we are, as\u000d\u000a      he recommends, introducing a real interest rate on student loans ... to\u000d\u000a      reduce the costs to the\u000d\u000a      exchequer' [H]. In further corroboration, a House of Commons Library\u000d\u000a      publication [I, p. 12]\u000d\u000a      acknowledged that `Professor Nicholas Barr has argued for some time that\u000d\u000a      the interest rate\u000d\u000a      subsidy is both inefficient and unfair'.\u000d\u000a    IMPACT: HUNGARY. As a result of earlier policy work\u000d\u000a      in the UK based on [2], an LSE team was\u000d\u000a      invited to assist in the design and implementation of a student loan in\u000d\u000a      Hungary (see source J).\u000d\u000a      Prior to the loan scheme there was no general system of student support in\u000d\u000a      Hungary. The loan\u000d\u000a      facility was therefore popular, because it gave students an option they\u000d\u000a      did not have before. The\u000d\u000a      scheme has universal access (i.e. all students are entitled to a loan, and\u000d\u000a      the size of the loan is not\u000d\u000a      income tested), and all students face the same loan conditions. The\u000d\u000a      crucial elements in the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research described in section 2 were (a) the importance of\u000d\u000a      income-contingent\u000d\u000a      repayments, (b) the need for loans to avoid interest subsidies and (c)\u000d\u000a      ensuring that the loan\u000d\u000a      scheme was classified as private. The resulting scheme has all these\u000d\u000a      features. The interest rate\u000d\u000a      has three elements: the cost of finance, a cohort risk premium, and an\u000d\u000a      element to cover\u000d\u000a      administrative costs (Berlinger 2009: K). The cost-of-finance element and\u000d\u000a      cohort risk premium\u000d\u000a      mean that the loan system breaks even and thus does not require a\u000d\u000a      substantial government\u000d\u000a      guarantee. The latter is the essential feature which allows the loan to be\u000d\u000a      classified as private, a\u000d\u000a      core objective, since at the time of its introduction Hungary faced a\u000d\u000a      binding requirement to comply\u000d\u000a      with the Stability and Growth Pact as a pre-condition for EU accession.\u000d\u000a    The final impact &#8212; better student support, facilitating investment in\u000d\u000a      human capital &#8212; is shown by the\u000d\u000a      history of the scheme. In 2008 the maximum size of the loan was increased,\u000d\u000a      and it became\u000d\u000a      possible to use loans to pay tuition fees directly to universities. In\u000d\u000a      2010 the European Investment\u000d\u000a      Bank agreed a new credit line of EUR 140 million, a market test of the\u000d\u000a      scheme's financial and\u000d\u000a      operational stability in the face of the economic crisis. In 2011, the\u000d\u000a      scheme's tenth year, the flow of\u000d\u000a      repayments matched loan outgoings, i.e. the system became self-financing\u000d\u000a      on a year-by-year\u000d\u000a      basis [L, pp. 46 and 50].\u000d\u000a    As indicators of significance, between 2008 and 2012, 64,000 students\u000d\u000a      took out loans totalling 61\u000d\u000a      billion Forints (approximately EUR 210 million) [L, p. 46). By 2012, the\u000d\u000a      scheme had made\u000d\u000a      cumulative loans of 247 billion Forints (approximately EUR 850 million, or\u000d\u000a      0.85% of GDP) to a total\u000d\u000a      of 331,000 students [L, p. 46], an average take-up rate of about 25 per\u000d\u000a      cent.\u000d\u000a    LINKS BETWEEN RESEARCH AND IMPACT. Consulting papers in 1999 [M]\u000d\u000a      were based on the research\u000d\u000a      described in section 2. Public acknowledgement includes an invitation [N]\u000d\u000a      from Csaba Bugar, CEO\u000d\u000a      of the Hungarian Student Loans Company to Nicholas Barr to give the\u000d\u000a      opening keynote address at\u000d\u000a      the tenth anniversary conference of the loan scheme: `It is a great\u000d\u000a      pleasure for us to officially invite\u000d\u000a      you to our conference .... Being a ... world-renowned expert ... and one\u000d\u000a      of the founding fathers of\u000d\u000a      the Hungarian scheme, your participation will make our conference an event\u000d\u000a      of great significance'.\u000d\u000a      Berlinger (2009: K) is explicit that `The Hungarian model, developed by\u000d\u000a      Nicholas Barr, may be\u000d\u000a      seen as an improved version of the British model' (p. 257).\u000d\u000a    IMPACT: EU LOAN FACILITY. Noting the success of the\u000d\u000a      Hungarian loan scheme, in 2010 DG-EAC\u000d\u000a      invited an LSE-led team to produce a feasibility study for an EU-wide\u000d\u000a      student loan. The resulting\u000d\u000a      institution, the Erasmus + Loan Guarantee Facility includes EUR 600\u000d\u000a      million in the EU budget for\u000d\u000a      2013-2020 (i.e. approximately EUR 85 million per year) to finance a\u000d\u000a      guarantee for an EU-wide\u000d\u000a      student loan for Master's degree students to foster student mobility. That\u000d\u000a      base level of finance will\u000d\u000a      underwrite around EUR 3.6 billion of student loans, i.e. EUR 500 million\u000d\u000a      per year. The scheme was\u000d\u000a      confirmed by the European Parliament in June 2013 [O]. It is too early for\u000d\u000a      final impacts.\u000d\u000a    LINKS BETWEEN RESEARCH AND IMPACT. The loan facility was presented\u000d\u000a      at a EU Testing Workshop\u000d\u000a      at the EU Commission in January 2011 and is set out in detail in a\u000d\u000a      consulting report [P, published\u000d\u000a      late 2011] by an LSE-led team, based on the research described in section\u000d\u000a      2.\u000d\u000a    WHY THE IMPACT MATTERS. Technological advance is driving up the\u000d\u000a      demand for skills. Thus the\u000d\u000a      size and quality of the higher education sector matters for national\u000d\u000a      economic performance; failure\u000d\u000a      to invest in human capital puts national competitiveness at risk. Social\u000d\u000a      mobility is important both as\u000d\u000a      a widely-held value judgement and because Europe cannot afford to waste\u000d\u000a      talent. Thus student\u000d\u000a      loans are an essential ingredient in policies to widen and deepen\u000d\u000a      investment in skills, contribute to\u000d\u000a      social mobility and, if well-designed, foster international mobility of\u000d\u000a      students. The impacts affect the\u000d\u000a      life chances of many young (and less young) people.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at LSE led by Nicholas Barr made documented contributions to\u000d\u000a      higher education finance\u000d\u000a      in England, Hungary and across the EU. Final impacts of the English\u000d\u000a      reforms between 2008 and\u000d\u000a      2012 included (a) more resources for universities and student support, (b)\u000d\u000a      more students, and\u000d\u000a      (c) wider participation. The reforms, which affected financial support for\u000d\u000a      over 1 million English-domiciled\u000d\u000a      students in 2011\/12, were designed to support economic growth by ensuring\u000d\u000a      a\u000d\u000a      continuing supply of higher level skills and to improve social mobility.\u000d\u000a    Growing out of earlier UK work, an LSE-led team designed a student loan\u000d\u000a      scheme for Hungary\u000d\u000a      which (a) provided financial support for large numbers of students, (b)\u000d\u000a      involved no additional public\u000d\u000a      spending, and (c) proved robust in the face of the economic crisis.\u000d\u000a    As a direct result of the success of that scheme, an LSE-led team was\u000d\u000a      invited to produce a\u000d\u000a      feasibility study for an EU-wide student loan facility.

In a series of articles and books\u000d\u000a      including [1], [2], [3], Nicholas\u000d\u000a      Barr's exploration of lessons from economic theory for the finance of\u000d\u000a      higher education yielded the\u000d\u000a      following insights: (a) Variable tuition fees improve both efficiency and\u000d\u000a      equity. Since higher\u000d\u000a      education has both social and private benefits, its costs should be shared\u000d\u000a      between taxpayers and\u000d\u000a      the individual beneficiary. Thus higher education should be financed\u000d\u000a      partly by the taxpayer and\u000d\u000a      partly through tuition fees; and, given the increasing scale and diversity\u000d\u000a      of higher education, the\u000d\u000a      research argued for variable fees within a regulated system. However,\u000d\u000a      students (the immediate\u000d\u000a      beneficiary) are credit constrained and so generally cannot afford to pay\u000d\u000a      fees. The research\u000d\u000a      therefore explored other sources of finance, and concluded (b) that the\u000d\u000a      only large-scale and\u000d\u000a      equitable source of private finance is the future earnings of students,\u000d\u000a      i.e. a loan scheme, (c) that an\u000d\u000a      efficient and equitable student loan should have income-contingent\u000d\u000a      repayments (i.e. repayments\u000d\u000a      calculated as x per cent of the borrower's subsequent income), and\u000d\u000a      (d) that an interest rate below\u000d\u000a      the government's cost of borrowing is fiscally costly and badly targeted.\u000d\u000a      Falkingham, Glennerster\u000d\u000a      and Barr (1995) [4] simulate different loan designs to show the dramatic\u000d\u000a      improvement in the\u000d\u000a      performance of loans with a positive real interest rate.\u000d\u000a    These principles underpinned work in England, Hungary and the EU. In\u000d\u000a      Hungary the need for the\u000d\u000a      budget to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact created an additional\u000d\u000a      design constraint, ruling\u000d\u000a      out public finance. But privately-financed loans are problematical because\u000d\u000a      under international\u000d\u000a      statistical rules, if loans include a government guarantee to private\u000d\u000a      lenders, the scheme counts as\u000d\u000a      public spending. Barr [5] was an early exploration into the private\u000d\u000a      finance of student loans. Drawing\u000d\u000a      on that work, the Hungarian design was the first to propose a solution, by\u000d\u000a      combining a cost-of-finance\u000d\u000a      element in the interest rate with a cohort risk premium. That solution was\u000d\u000a      approved by\u000d\u000a      Eurostat. Though privately-financed student loans are not new, the\u000d\u000a      combination of private finance\u000d\u000a      with income-contingent repayments was novel and has attracted considerable\u000d\u000a      interest. The\u000d\u000a      approach was developed further in Barr [3, especially Ch. 14].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41644","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The reach of the impact achieved by this research has extended to\u000d\u000a      governmental and official bodies at the European level, and to educational\u000d\u000a      groupings both nationally and internationally. This is indicated by: (i)\u000d\u000a      Engagement of a large number of academics, officials and Non-Governmental\u000d\u000a      Organisation (NGO) representatives in a common project (The seven series\u000d\u000a      of Cross-National Research Papers involved 234 authors from 16 countries,\u000d\u000a      and IPROSEC covered 11 countries, and the impact on those involved has\u000d\u000a      extended significantly into the 2008-2013 period) [5.1]; (ii)\u000d\u000a      Creation of a large cross-national network of researchers including young\u000d\u000a      researchers with an explicit focus on enhancement of their training and\u000d\u000a      professional skills (opportunities for them to acquire skills and publish)\u000d\u000a      (13 non-UK partners and 20 research assistants for IPROSEC and 8 core team\u000d\u000a      members for the ESRC seminar competition award in 6 countries; events held\u000d\u000a      in Paris and Tallinn). Again, this has had significant resonances in the\u000d\u000a      later careers of those involved [5.1,]; (iii) Transfer and sharing\u000d\u000a      of knowledge through workshops, policy papers, reports, policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations (see above) [5.2, 5.3, 5.4]; (iv) The ESRC\u000d\u000a      training programme in International Social Research Methods involved the\u000d\u000a      design and organisation of a launch event (May 2010) to assess research\u000d\u000a      training needs in academia, government, private and NGO sectors throughout\u000d\u000a      the UK [5.4, 5.5]. Seven workshops were held during the funding\u000d\u000a      period in London, Paris and Nantes, in cooperation with the British\u000d\u000a      Library, British Council in London and Paris, the Society for Research in\u000d\u000a      Higher Education and R&#233;seau des Maisons des Sciences de l'Homme, for\u000d\u000a      experienced researchers seeking to develop their competence in\u000d\u000a      international research methods [5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8]. The\u000d\u000a      success of the work carried out under the award has been recognised\u000d\u000a      through requests to extend the programme to postgraduate\/postdoctoral\u000d\u000a      research students (Bristol and Leeds) and to run further workshops at\u000d\u000a      venues in France (Rennes, Lille) after the end of the life of the project\u000d\u000a      [5.4]. To date, a total of almost 200 participants have benefitted\u000d\u000a      directly from the training provision; (v) A database of International\u000d\u000a      Social Research Methods Case Studies has been developed hosted by the\u000d\u000a      ESRC's National Centre for Research Methods, and Palgrave has launched a\u000d\u000a      web companion for International Comparative Methods, which has\u000d\u000a      also been made available as an e-book, thereby extending the reach of the\u000d\u000a      project worldwide [5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8]; (vi) The\u000d\u000a      International Social Research Council is interested in including\u000d\u000a      international social research methods training in its fellowship scheme.\u000d\u000a      This is proving to be an area of training that is underdeveloped in other\u000d\u000a      countries. Publicity about the launch of the databank has, for example,\u000d\u000a      brought requests from researchers in South Africa and Slovakia. The\u000d\u000a      research has thus reached a wide range of audiences at several levels:\u000d\u000a      education and training beyond the host institution, policy officials,\u000d\u000a      networks of professionals and researchers in a variety of national and\u000d\u000a      cross-national contexts.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the impact generated by the research is\u000d\u000a      indicated by: (i) Creation of an enhanced knowledge base for policy\u000d\u000a      innovation and for the enhancement of international research methods. The\u000d\u000a      IPROSEC and related projects have been particularly important in\u000d\u000a      incorporating `new' EU Member States that entered the Union in 2004, and\u000d\u000a      extending the network to them, creating new knowledge from what was often\u000d\u000a      a low base and disseminating good practice in cross-national social\u000d\u000a      (policy) research [5.1, 5.2, 5.4]; (ii) The International Social\u000d\u000a      Research Training project has resulted in the creation of research methods\u000d\u000a      resource in the form of an on-line data bank of International Social\u000d\u000a      Research Methods Case Studies, based on a Framework, developed in large\u000d\u000a      part from the International Comparative Research web companion,\u000d\u000a      under the auspices of the ESRC Re-Store initiative. The website is proving\u000d\u000a      to be a valuable resource for researchers embarking on international\u000d\u000a      research projects both in policy studies and in other areas of social\u000d\u000a      science research [5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8]. In the ESRC impact\u000d\u000a      report on the RDI project, the Framework is cited as a key innovation;\u000d\u000a      (iii) The methods and training activities encompassed by the International\u000d\u000a      Social Research Methods project have had a strategic impact by\u000d\u000a      contributing to the development of a national infrastructure for\u000d\u000a      researcher development, and this has reached beyond the UK through the\u000d\u000a      provision of international training and the on-line databank, which have\u000d\u000a      acted as a catalyst for further research and training activities [5.3,\u000d\u000a        5.4]. The activities have fostered innovation through a novel focus\u000d\u000a      on the development of flexible-use training materials, and the on-line\u000d\u000a      databank provides a sustainable baseline for the engagement of further\u000d\u000a      participants [5.3, 5.4, 5.7].

The research has\u000d\u000a      thus had substantial significance for policy debate and formation during\u000d\u000a      the 2008-2013 period, especially in the area of international social\u000d\u000a      research methods drawing upon extensive comparative and cross-national\u000d\u000a      work.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study focuses on the impact of research undertaken within the\u000d\u000a      European Research Centre (ERC) and the Centre for the Study of\u000d\u000a      International Governance at Loughborough University between 1993 and 2009,\u000d\u000a      primarily by Professor Linda Hantrais (1993-2008 and now Emeritus).

The leading role in the activity was taken by\u000d\u000a      Professor Linda Hantrais (Professor in the unit until 2008 &#8212; now Emeritus\u000d\u000a      professor in the unit), who is a leading expert on issues of\u000d\u000a      cross-national and international research and has applied these to a range\u000d\u000a      of European and national policy issues. This case study focuses on\u000d\u000a      Professor Hantrais' work and its later impact. Two interrelated elements\u000d\u000a      are key to this research:\u000d\u000a    (1) Cross-National Research Seminars, International Social Research\u000d\u000a        Methods Training Workshops, and Network Building (1993-2013): this\u000d\u000a      work, organised for much of the period through the European Research\u000d\u000a      Centre under the leadership of Professor Linda Hantrais, focused on the\u000d\u000a      theoretical, methodological, managerial and practical issues involved in\u000d\u000a      research that crosses national boundaries and on the application of such\u000d\u000a      research in policy analysis. The Cross-National Research Group ran a\u000d\u000a      series of seminars and training events, throughout the 1990s and the early\u000d\u000a      2000s, which attracted funding from the Economic and Social Research\u000d\u000a      Council, Centre National de Recherches Scientifiques Franco-British\u000d\u000a      Programme, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and European Commission, and\u000d\u000a      produced seven series of Cross-National Research Papers that were\u000d\u000a      published by the ERC during the late 1990s and early 2000s (a total of 38\u000d\u000a      issues of collected papers). The work of the Unit led to the publication\u000d\u000a      of a cross-national research methods source book (1996), a special issue\u000d\u000a      of the International Journal of Social Research Methodology (1999,\u000d\u000a      reissued as a book in 2007), a single-authored book [3.6] on International\u000a        Comparative Research: theory, methods and practice (plus a web\u000d\u000a      companion in 2012 and an e-book in 2013). Further ESRC funding was\u000d\u000a      obtained for a consultancy to develop and roll out a training programme in\u000d\u000a      International Social Research Methods across the UK and abroad under the\u000d\u000a      Researcher Development Initiative in 2010-12, resulting in a sustainable\u000d\u000a      databank of International Social Research Methods Case Studies (http:\/\/www.restore.ac.uk\/ISResMeth\/).\u000d\u000a    (2) Research on European Social Policy and Comparisons of Family\u000d\u000a        Policies in Europe (1994-2013): This work took the form in its early\u000d\u000a      stages of a workshop-centred project on concepts and contexts in\u000d\u000a      comparisons of family policies in Europe, funded by the ESRC, the Caisse\u000d\u000a      Nationale des Allocations Familiales and the European Commission\u000d\u000a      (1994-96). This later led to two major projects funded by the European\u000d\u000a      Commission and coordinated in the ERC: (i) `The Interaction Between Family\u000d\u000a      Policies and Social Protection in the Context of Recent and Future\u000d\u000a      Socio-Demographic Change' (1997-1998), which produced a number of Cross-National\u000a        Research Papers (http:\/\/www,xnat.org.uk),\u000a      refereed journal articles [for example 3.1] and an edited volume [3.2];\u000d\u000a      (ii) Improving Policy Responses and Outcomes to Socio-Economic Challenges\u000d\u000a      (IPROSEC) (funded under FP5, 2000-2003), which involved an eleven-nation\u000d\u000a      comparative study and produced a wide range of policy papers, books [for\u000d\u000a      example 3.3], articles, [for example 3.4] and reports.\u000d\u000a      Both of the European-funded projects, in conjunction with three editions\u000d\u000a      of Social Policy in the European Union [3.5] involved\u000d\u000a      extensive interaction with officials and other practitioners as part of\u000d\u000a      the fieldwork and dissemination process and resulted in Professor Hantrais\u000d\u000a      being invited to act as expert advisor to DG Employment's High Level Group\u000d\u000a      of Experts on Demographic Issues (2007-12), and as editor and advisor for\u000d\u000a      the Commission's 2008 and 2010 Demographic Reports.\u000d\u000a    These two strands of research have come together during the period\u000d\u000a      2008-13 to provide the foundation for new initiatives in international\u000d\u000a      social research methods, and this is the basis for the claim of impact\u000d\u000a      made below.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41645","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The reach of the research impacts created by this work lies in a\u000d\u000a      number of areas,, where it has influenced and informed policy debate. First,\u000d\u000a      there is the creation of networks involving EU and non-EU academics,\u000d\u000a      officials, diplomats at international and national levels, and\u000d\u000a      Non-Governmental Organisation representatives. In the case of the work on\u000d\u000a      diplomatic innovation, this took the form of collaboration with the UK,\u000d\u000a      Canadian, Finnish and Australian Ministries of Foreign Affairs and with a\u000d\u000a      range of academic institutions [such as the Asia Pacific College of\u000d\u000a      Diplomacy (Australian National University, Canberra] of whose\u000d\u000a      international advisory board Professor Hocking is a member] and think\u000d\u000a      tanks [5.2, 5.3, 5.4]. Between 2005 and 2008, Professor Hocking\u000d\u000a      was invited to address meetings at the Department of Foreign Affairs and\u000d\u000a      International Trade (DFAIT) in Ottawa attended by a DFAIT and other\u000d\u000a      government official and representatives of civil society groups [5.2].\u000d\u000a      At the EU level, a series of meetings on the changing role of foreign\u000d\u000a      ministries were held in Brussels, Paris and London convened by\u000d\u000a      DG-Relex\/European External Action Service. Second, there is\u000d\u000a      knowledge transfer through workshops, policy papers, reports and policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations to a variety of official and non-governmental audiences.\u000d\u000a      On the public diplomacy agenda, a major forum for disseminating\u000d\u000a      information has been a series of three conferences held at Wilton Park\u000d\u000a      (the Foreign and Commonwealth Office conference centre) sponsored by the\u000d\u000a      FCO and attended by some 150 diplomats from around the world together with\u000d\u000a      meetings convened at the Institute of Government by the Cabinet Office and\u000d\u000a      FCO on the uses of `soft power' in UK diplomacy [5.1]. BH assisted\u000d\u000a      in the organisation of these meetings and gave presentations at them [5.7].\u000d\u000a      Third, the Futures for Diplomacy: Integrative Diplomacy in the\u000d\u000a        21st Century report has now been released\u000d\u000a      by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is available on the\u000d\u000a      Clingendael Institute (The Hague) website where it has registered `hits'\u000d\u000a      placing it in the top five of the institute's major reports. A major\u000d\u000a      meeting of 45 policy planners from foreign ministries and international\u000d\u000a      organisations was held in The Hague in March 2013 and has been followed by\u000d\u000a      the first of a series of policy papers (The Future of Foreign Ministries)\u000d\u000a      on the changing nature of diplomacy [5.3]. Further meetings are\u000d\u000a      planned and are being discussed with national foreign ministries &#8212; ]such\u000d\u000a      as the South Korean and Swedish Ministries of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Foreign Affairs University are\u000d\u000a      convening a conference in Beijing in November 2013 to discuss the Futures\u000d\u000a      report. Fourth, key issues relating to the research have been\u000d\u000a      communicated to a broader audience through op-ed articles and media\u000d\u000a      presentations. Thus, for example, when BH was advising the Australian\u000d\u000a      Senate Foreign Affairs Committee enquiry into Australian public diplomacy\u000d\u000a      (Canberra 2007) he was asked to write an article [`Diplomacy adopts a new\u000d\u000a      style', Canberra Times, 28 May 2007] and this was followed by\u000d\u000a      interviews on news programmes. Similarly, the Futures report has\u000d\u000a      been followed by op-ed articles in the China Daily, Japan\u000d\u000a        Times and Korea Herald.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the impact can be measured in part by\u000d\u000a      continuing requests from foreign ministries for briefings on change in\u000d\u000a      diplomatic structures. Current work is in progress with the FCO [e.g.Counterpoint\u000a        2020 - 5.6], and has been undertaken with the Dutch [5.5]\u000d\u000a      and Swedish MFAs. The explicit focus here is on policy innovation\u000d\u000a      especially in terms of diplomatic institutions, personnel and practices &#8212;\u000d\u000a      ]particularly in the public diplomacy area. Much of this work represents\u000d\u000a      the application of scholarly research to the demands of policy makers in\u000d\u000a      new and changing environments. As section 5 indicates, this is evidenced\u000d\u000a      by: (i) the commissioning of reports and briefings by, foreign ministries\u000d\u000a      &#8212; ]for example, the Finnish Foreign Ministry and the FCO and Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office in the UK [5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 5.7]; (ii) Work with UK Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Australian Government on\u000d\u000a      the ways in which `soft power' resources might be enhanced [5.1, 5.7];\u000d\u000a      (iii) Enhancement of debate on diplomatic processes globally and in the\u000d\u000a      European Union specifically, especially the European External, Action\u000d\u000a      Service (EEAS); (iv) Incorporation into diplomatic training activities at\u000d\u000a      European and broader international levels [5.8, 5.9]. For example:\u000d\u000a      College of Europe (Bruges), Clingendael Institute (Netherlands), Geneva\u000d\u000a      Centre for Security Policy and a number of diplomatic academies (BH is a\u000d\u000a      member of the International Forum for Deans and Directors of Diplomatic\u000d\u000a      Academies and was chair of the UK section 2004-7). The research has thus\u000d\u000a      contributed significantly to enhancement of policy debate among the\u000d\u000a      diplomatic and related communities, and has helped to shape the responses\u000d\u000a      of diplomats and diplomatic organisations to a changing global\u000d\u000a      environment.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The impact arises from high quality analysis and evaluation of governance\u000d\u000a      practices &#8212; ]especially those linked to diplomacy at the national,\u000d\u000a      European and international levels.

Exploring the Interface between Governance and\u000d\u000a        Diplomacy': In this project Professor Hocking acted as UK Convenor\u000d\u000a      of a large multi-national project. The broad aim of the project was to\u000d\u000a      critically examine global governance theorising and to reformulate basic\u000d\u000a      concepts of diplomacy in the light of its changing processes and\u000d\u000a      structures. The project linked Loughborough University with the Centre for\u000d\u000a      International Governance Innovation (Canada) and the Asia Pacific Centre\u000d\u000a      for Diplomacy (ANU, Canberra). Outputs included three major conferences in\u000d\u000a      each country involving policy practitioners and academics, a series of\u000d\u000a      policy papers and an edited book (Cooper, Hocking and Maley 2008). Its\u000d\u000a      major conceptual contribution has been to link traditionally separated\u000d\u000a      academic discourses focused on globalisation and diplomatic studies. Key\u000d\u000a      findings related to the changing character of diplomacy, especially the\u000d\u000a      rise of `network diplomacy' and `multi-stakeholder' diplomacy in the\u000d\u000a      period since the end of the Cold War. [3.3]\u000d\u000a    (2) Change and Innovation in Diplomacy in which Professor Hocking\u000d\u000a      was Principal Investigator in a project funded by the Canadian Government.\u000d\u000a      Major findings from this work have been the changing character of\u000d\u000a      `national diplomatic systems' the changing role of foreign ministries\u000d\u000a      within them, the rise of networked diplomacy, `soft power' and the\u000d\u000a      deployment of public diplomacy strategies by government agencies. The core\u000d\u000a      of the project involved extensive investigation of change within the UK\u000d\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Canadian Department of Foreign\u000d\u000a      Affairs and International Trade. This has resulted in more focused work on\u000d\u000a      the deployment of public diplomacy strategies in UK Government\u000d\u000a      specifically with the Cabinet Office and the FCO `Engagement' project.\u000d\u000a      This work in turn led to the project `Futures for Diplomacy', spanning\u000d\u000a      2011-2012, in which Professor Hocking was engaged with the Clingendael\u000d\u000a      Institute in The Hague on research funded by the Finnish Foreign Ministry,\u000d\u000a      centering on the changing structures and processes of diplomacy and their\u000d\u000a      implications for the organisation of foreign ministries. Amongst the key\u000d\u000a      findings of this phase has been the confusion within Ministries of Foreign\u000d\u000a      Affairs when it comes to implementing network strategies in diplomacy and\u000d\u000a      the need to clearly articulate the role of the 21st century\u000d\u000a      diplomat in the light of conflicting objectives.

His recommendations, based on his research described in section 3,\u000a      to upgrade and give extra resources to the `Eastern Partnership' programme\u000a      since its formal launch in May 2009 have been taken up by the EU, leading\u000a      to a highly successful advisory mission to Moldova. He has consistently\u000a      argued for twin track policies of `sign and sanction' (`carrots and\u000a      sticks') in Belarus and Ukraine and contributed to making the Ukrainian\u000a      media more free and fair around election time in 2012.\u000a    Wilson has pursued an active engagement strategy with senior and\u000a      influential decision-makers across Europe, both independently and as a\u000a      senior policy fellow in a leading European think tank, the European\u000a      Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). Drawing on his research, Wilson's\u000a      high-level policy engagement - writing briefing notes, attending policy\u000a      meetings and seminars, and private advice - has substantially shaped the\u000a      EU's relations with its key Eastern neighbours.\u000a    European Union (EU) relations with Moldova\u000a    An Eastern Partnership (EaP) policy was formally launched on 7 May 2009.\u000a      This EU policy is a technocratic, long-term strategy of offering\u000a      partnership countries (the post-Soviet states of Armenia, Azerbaijan,\u000a      Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine) the prospect of eventual political\u000a      and economic alignment with the EU while dampening hopes of actual\u000a      accession. In 2008-2009, a series of crises (conflict in Georgia, a gas\u000a      crisis in Ukraine and the burning of the Moldovan parliament) indicated a\u000a      need to rethink the EaP. In 2008-10 whilst a Senior Policy Fellow at the\u000a      ECFR, Wilson collaborated with Nicu Popescu, a Moldova expert, to draw on\u000a      his arguments in [a] to show that the EU's policy of `enlargement-lite'\u000a      would not be successful in eastern Europe. Wilson and Popescu argued that\u000a      the EU was ineffective in responding to crises in partnership countries\u000a      and that, consequently, Russia was strengthening its influence in the\u000a      region [c]. Moldova had recently held disputed elections with serious\u000a      violations of human rights. As a result, relations with the EU were at an\u000a      all-time low. Wilson and Popescu argued that the best way to improve EU\u000a      relations was through `soft' approaches such as sending policy advisors to\u000a      support the development of democratic institutions.\u000a    This report was widely praised in the press, including by the Economist\u000a      and the Guardian [1]. Wilson and Popescu launched a highly\u000a      activist advocacy strategy, including three EU-Russia seminars in Brussels\u000a      with key EU officials (July 2008-May 2009), private meetings and\u000a      delivering briefing notes to key policy makers, such as French Foreign\u000a      Minister Bernard Kouchner (August 2008), and EU Foreign Policy High\u000a      Representative Catherine Ashton (June 2010). The report was quoted in a\u000a      speech by Poland's Foreign Minister, Radek Sikorski, at the Eastern\u000a      Partnership summit in Warsaw in September 2011 [2], demonstrating that\u000a      policymakers were listening.\u000a    Wilson and Popescu's arguments proved successful. The EaP was upgraded,\u000a      made more conditional (the `more for more' policy) and given greater\u000a      resources [3]. In 2011 the EU declared a need to revise its European\u000a      Neighbourhood Policy which governs EU relations with countries to the East\u000a      and South of the EU: Wilson's research and advice [c] is evident in one of\u000a      the four strands of the new approach, \"to provide greater support to\u000a        partners engaged in building deep democracy\" (rights to free speech,\u000a      competitive political parties and impartial justice) [4].\u000a    Wilson's and Popescu's recommendation to send policy advisors to Moldova\u000a      to support democratic reforms was adopted: the EU High Level Policy Advice\u000a      Mission (EUHLPM) to Moldova was constituted in January 2010, with a team\u000a      of 15 international expert advisors, and a current budget of &#8364;6.6 million\u000a      funded by the European Union and co-funded and implemented by the United\u000a      Nations Development Programme in Moldova [5]. Since then, the EUHLPM has\u000a      helped to make this tiny and impoverished country a `star pupil'. By 2012,\u000a      Moldova ranked first in the Eastern Partnership Index for the liberal\u000a      reforms encouraged by the EU and was the only one to buck a trend towards\u000a      increasing authoritarianism [5]. The importance of the EUHLPM's\u000a      contribution was recognised by the extension of its term to October 2013\u000a      and the increase of resources allocated to the EUHLPM from &#8364;1.5 million\u000a      initially to &#8364;6.6 million in 2013 [5].\u000a    EU sanctions policy in Belarus\u000a    Shortly after a rigged election in 2010 and an aggressive crackdown on\u000a      protests by Belarus, Wilson argued in an ECFR policy paper that, based on\u000a      his analysis of President Lukashenka's hold on power [d], the EU needed to\u000a      raise the stakes for both Belarus and Russia through a mixture of targeted\u000a      and `smart' isolation, selective sanctions and engagement [6], including\u000a      the cessation of high-level contacts, visa bans for those responsible for\u000a      the December 2010 election fraud (the `sticks') and simultaneous\u000a      investment in civil society (the `carrot'). These recommendations were\u000a      disseminated among EU policymakers through meetings, briefings and\u000a      discussions, including two events (2010, 2011) where Wilson was lead\u000a      speaker at the UK Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO). As a direct\u000a      result [6], EU sanctions policy for Belarus changed to a `twin-track'\u000a      policy of selective sanctions against Belarusian officials and support for\u000a      civil society. This was announced by the European Commissioner for\u000a      Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy (&#352;tefan F&#252;le) on 2 February\u000a      2011, who also announced an increase in funding for civil society from &#8364;4\u000a      million to &#8364;15.6 million [7].\u000a    Suspension of the EU free trade agreement with Ukraine\u000a    The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) aims to give Ukraine a\u000a      framework for modernising its trade relations with the EU through market\u000a      liberalisation and various trade-related regulations to bring key sectors\u000a      of the Ukrainian economy into alignment with EU standards. With a\u000a      population of 45 million, Ukraine is the largest country in the Eastern\u000a      Partnership and the EU is one of its most important trade partners. Yet\u000a      relations were at an impasse because of concerns about the selective\u000a      persecution of regime opponents and increasing authoritarianism and\u000a      corruption.\u000a    In 2011 when EU-Ukraine relations were at a low point and negotiations on\u000a      the DCFTA almost at an impasse, Wilson argued in a memo [8] for the ECFR\u000a      that, based on his findings in [c], the EU should take a `sign and\u000a      sanction' approach to keep the DCFTA alive and allow Ukraine time to\u000a      implement the policies recommended by the EU. As a result of Wilson's\u000a      advice [6] disseminated through policy papers and talks, these\u000a      recommendations were adopted by the EU in late 2011 [8].\u000a    Influencing election monitoring in Ukraine\u000a    Wilson's research [a] had showed how some political elites in post-Soviet\u000a      countries systematically use political technology to `fake\u000a      democracy'. This was instrumental in shaping the strategy used by the\u000a      Election Observation Mission (EOM) of the Organisation for Security and\u000a      Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) for the 2012 parliamentary elections in\u000a      Ukraine.\u000a    In 2006, Wilson was appointed advisor [9] to the OSCE, which monitors\u000a      elections to check compliance with standards for democratic elections.\u000a      Here, he drew on [a] to argue that election monitoring in post-Soviet\u000a      countries should consider the election process as a whole instead of\u000a      focusing on election day itself. Manipulating the cast list for the actual\u000a      participants in elections, he argued, is as important for the elections\u000a      outcomes as fraud in the counting process.\u000a    As a result of this advice, there were tangible changes in how the\u000a      623-member strong OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights\u000a      (ODIHR) EOM approached the 2012 parliamentary elections in Ukraine. In the\u000a      early 2000s, the OSCE-ODIHR only looked at due process and clean counting\u000a      on election day, whereas in 2012 its EOM in Ukraine was an embedded\u000a      mission lasting several weeks to examine whether the whole process may be\u000a      corrupted [10]. As a result, the EOM identified specific political\u000a      technologies used to `fake democracy' [a], including abuse of state\u000a      resources, lack of transparency of campaign and party financing and the\u000a      lack of balanced media coverage [11]. Following the recommendations of\u000a      this report, Ukraine announced the start of an electoral reform process,\u000a      and the OSCE was requested to comment on the draft laws in April 2013.\u000a      Some of the positive changes of the proposed reform which derive\u000a      ultimately from Wilson's research are:\u000a    \u000a      Introducing requirements for reporting on the origin and use of\u000a        campaign funds before election day and for publication of these reports\u000a        on the CEC website;\u000a      Including provisions intended to result in less biased coverage of the\u000a        elections by the media and to reduce privileges given to government\u000a        candidates over other candidates (p. 5, [12]).\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Dr Andrew Wilson underpinned the development of policy\u000a      planning and advocacy which shaped European Union (EU) policy towards\u000a      Russia and the six countries of the Eastern Partnership.

Revealing the key `tricks of the\u000a      trade' made it easier for analysts and observers to spot corruption and\u000a      lack of real reform behind the fa&#231;ade. Political technologies used to\u000a      `construct politics' include the abuse of administrative resources,\u000a      disguising a party's or politician's true nature by creating virtual\u000a      brands, media manipulation, construction of political parties, destruction\u000a      of political opponents, the framing of campaign dynamics and the\u000a      manipulation of election results. Virtual politics is thus `the way\u000a        that elites seek to manage, manipulate and contain democracy' in the\u000a      run up to elections and on election day.\u000a    Further research applied these findings to Russia. In 2008 Wilson showed\u000a      that the original assumption about Russia held by many scholars and\u000a      commentators that the newly elected president, Dmitry Medvedev, was a\u000a      `more democratic' replacement for Putin was deeply flawed [b]. Moreover,\u000a      with local leaders only paying lip-service to `European values', he argued\u000a      that the EU's policy of `enlargement-lite' lacked real pulling power to\u000a      transform Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus [c].\u000a    Wilson expanded this thesis and its geographical coverage with his\u000a      examination of Ukraine [f]. In 2013, he used it to outline two scenarios\u000a      for Ukraine: one of collapse or popular protests, and a second, more\u000a      realistic scenario, that Ukraine will remain difficult to change [e].\u000a      Similarly, his study of Belarus [d], attributed the longevity of President\u000a      Aliaksandr Lukashenka to skilful manipulation of both internal and foreign\u000a      policy, despite human rights abuses and involvement in a series of rigged\u000a      elections.\u000a    Wilson's key, much-cited policy-oriented work on the six `Eastern\u000a      Partnership' States (the states bordering Russia and the expanded EU)\u000a      argued that the EU needed to rethink its approach to the six countries or\u000a      face a ring of failing states and an increasingly active Russia rebuilding\u000a      its sphere of influence [c].\u000a    Wilson joined the School of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies at UCL\u000a      as a Lecturer in 1996, then became Senior Lecturer, and since 2008 has\u000a      been Reader in Ukrainian Studies.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41875","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"630336","Name":"Belarus"},{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    On the basis of expertise garnered through the research outlined above,\u000d\u000a      Professor Slavo Radosevic has been invited to participate in a succession\u000d\u000a      of high-level advisory groups; their recommendations for the design of\u000d\u000a      research and innovation policy in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of\u000d\u000a      Independent States (CIS), as well as the EU's research policy and\u000d\u000a      programme for the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region, have been\u000d\u000a      underpinned by his work. Radosevic's continuous engagement with both\u000d\u000a      individual states and European bodies is an important indicator of the\u000d\u000a      impact of his research. Supporting scientific and technological innovation\u000d\u000a      as a driver of economic growth is a central facet of EU policy, and one of\u000d\u000a      the major areas of Structural Funds for new EU member states.\u000d\u000a    Impact on EU policy on funding research: EU support for research\u000d\u000a      and innovation is administered through its Framework Programmes (FPs) for\u000d\u000a      Research and Development. FP7, which ran from 2007 to 2013, administered a\u000d\u000a      total budget of over &#8364;50 billion, representing a 61% increase over its\u000d\u000a      predecessor, FP6. In 2008, Radosevic was appointed chair of an expert\u000d\u000a      group on innovation policy established under the EU Czech Presidency\u000d\u000a      (October 2008-January 2009) [see 1, section 5]. In this role, he promoted\u000d\u000a      country-specific approaches to innovation policy, dependent on their\u000d\u000a      distance from the technology frontier. This neo-Schumpeterian idea was\u000d\u000a      also articulated in applied policy analysis published in [a], and in 2010\u000d\u000a      led, for the first time to a specific call within the EU FP7 programme\u000d\u000a      devoted to the CEE region, as part of the 2011 work programme [1]. This\u000d\u000a      call, `Addressing cohesion challenges in Central and Eastern Europe',\u000d\u000a      allocated an indicative budget of &#8364;5.4 million to small or medium-sized\u000d\u000a      research projects on this subject.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Slovenia's Research and Innovation Strategy: In 2010,\u000d\u000a      Radosevic was appointed Team Leader of the Policy Mix Review expert group\u000d\u000a      constituted by the Slovenian government to advise on the country's\u000d\u000a      innovation policy [2, p. 1]. On 22 December 2010, he presented the group's\u000d\u000a      recommendations to the Slovenian Council for Science and Technology,\u000d\u000a      chaired by the then-President of Slovenia, Dr Danilo Turk. Following\u000d\u000a      recommendations made in [a] and [e], the gist of the advice given to and\u000d\u000a      taken on board by the Council was that, in transforming from innovation\u000d\u000a      follower to moderate innovator, Slovenia would need to improve\u000d\u000a      coordination of RTD policies across different stakeholders [2, especially\u000d\u000a      recommendation 1, p. 28-29]. This was followed by the adoption by the\u000d\u000a      National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia of the Resolution on\u000d\u000a      Research and Innovation Strategy of Slovenia 2011-2020 (OG 43\/2011) [2],\u000d\u000a      which became legally binding in May 2011, and which refers explicitly to\u000d\u000a      recommendations made by the expert group as one of the three sources\u000d\u000a      forming the basis for the design of the policy, specifically the `systems\u000d\u000a      innovation' approach described in section 2. The key recommendation for\u000d\u000a      improved coordination across different stakeholders, rather than just an\u000d\u000a      increase in the R&amp;D budget, was also followed in the design of the\u000d\u000a      Slovenian strategy for smart specialisation, which was the main\u000d\u000a      precondition for Slovenia in 2013 to draw on European Structural Funds in\u000d\u000a      2014-2020 [3].\u000d\u000a    Impact on EU Research Policy Design and Evaluation: In 2009,\u000d\u000a      Radosevic was appointed a member of the EC DG Research expert group\u000d\u000a      chaired by Professor Luc Soete (Maastricht) on `The role of community\u000d\u000a      research policy in the knowledge-based economy' [4, p. iv]. The group's\u000d\u000a      objective was to develop recommendations on how to frame and articulate\u000d\u000a      the EU's research policy, its objectives and means of action (both\u000d\u000a      financial and non-financial) after 2010, in order to improve its role in\u000d\u000a      fostering the development of the EU knowledge-based economy, strengthening\u000d\u000a      the competitiveness of industry in the EU and stimulating innovation-based\u000d\u000a      growth. In its analysis of cohesion issues, the expert group report draws\u000d\u000a      on four of Radosevic's publications. His research contributed to the\u000d\u000a      group's recommendations on cohesion policies and the application of `smart\u000d\u000a      specialisation' strategies as the approach to innovation and growth within\u000d\u000a      the EU Structural Funds for 2014-2020 [4: p.177-201].\u000d\u000a    The group's recommendations were subsequently taken on board in design of\u000d\u000a      the new EU research policy `Horizon 2020'. Five expert groups &#8212; including\u000d\u000a      the EC DG Research group &#8212; published a joint statement in January 2010,\u000d\u000a      arguing for a new approach to research and innovation in Europe [4]. This\u000d\u000a      statement informed and influenced discussion and debate within the\u000d\u000a      European Parliament and eventually fed into the development of Horizon\u000d\u000a      2020 policies. The on-going significance of this contribution is\u000d\u000a      demonstrated by the fact that, based on his in-depth understanding of the\u000d\u000a      interaction between innovation and growth of CEE countries, Radosevic was\u000d\u000a      invited in 2012 by the EC DG Regio to assist and evaluate `smart\u000d\u000a      specialisation' strategies in several new member states (Bulgaria,\u000d\u000a      Slovakia and Slovenia) and to provide recommendations for improved\u000d\u000a      implementation. Radosevic has since done this: in 2012, for example, he\u000d\u000a      co-authored a special report on the implementation of smart specialisation\u000d\u000a      in Bulgaria [5], and was appointed by the EC DG Regio as advisor to the\u000d\u000a      Slovak government advising on country-specific strategies during 2013 [5].\u000d\u000a    UNECE Study on Innovation Systems and Its Application in Belarus:\u000d\u000a      The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) seeks to promote an\u000d\u000a      environment conducive to economic growth, competitiveness and\u000d\u000a      knowledge-based growth in Europe and central Asia. In 2007 it commissioned\u000d\u000a      a study titled `Creating a conducive environment for higher\u000d\u000a      competitiveness and effective national innovation systems: Lessons learned\u000d\u000a      from the experiences of UNECE countries, 2007'. This study, which was\u000d\u000a      revised and republished the same year by the United Nations, acknowledged\u000d\u000a      Radosevic's `major substantive contribution' (including the majority of\u000d\u000a      the report), and referred repeatedly to his research outputs, drawing\u000d\u000a      particularly on [d] [6].\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, this report has been used in former Soviet countries as a\u000d\u000a      state-of-the-art review of issues in innovation policy. In Belarus, for\u000d\u000a      instance, a country-specific Innovation Policy Review was carried out in\u000d\u000a      2010 on the basis of the UNECE report. Radosevic authored a chapter on\u000d\u000a      knowledge generation and transfer and co-authored an assessment of recent\u000d\u000a      performance as part of that Review, the recommendations from which formed\u000d\u000a      the basis for new state policies to encourage innovation [7]. Policy\u000d\u000a      changes following these recommendations included:\u000d\u000a    - The law `On the state innovation policy and innovation in the Republic\u000d\u000a      of Belarus', provided a broad concept of innovation policy and recognising\u000d\u000a      the importance of entrepreneurship in state promotion of innovation.\u000d\u000a    - The newly adopted law `On amendments and additions to certain laws on\u000d\u000a      the legal protection of intellectual property' assigned clearly defined\u000d\u000a      property rights to R&amp;D organisations and individuals.\u000d\u000a    - Presidential Decrees 503 (8 Nov 2012) and 357 (7 Aug 2012) introduced\u000d\u000a      changes in public financing in order to increase tolerance for risk in\u000d\u000a      public support for innovation activities. This included increased\u000d\u000a      resources for the Belarusian Innovation Fund with budgetary funding for\u000d\u000a      science and innovation.\u000d\u000a    Radosevic has continued to engage with this change in innovation policy:\u000d\u000a      thus, for example, he made an invited appearance on 15 November 2012 at a\u000d\u000a      workshop organised by UNECE and the State Committee on Science and\u000d\u000a      Technology on the `National Innovation Capacity Index and its application\u000d\u000a      in countries of Central and Eastern Europe', held for Belarus policymakers\u000d\u000a      in Minsk [8].\u000d\u000a    Radosevic also evaluated a similar report for Kazakhstan [9], contributed\u000d\u000a      to a similar review in Ukraine in 2012 [9] and, on the basis of these\u000d\u000a      contributions, was invited to join the expert team reviewing progress in\u000d\u000a      Armenia, which began in September 2013.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted at UCL on innovation and innovation systems in Central\u000d\u000a      and Eastern European countries is rooted in a neo-Schumpeterian\u000d\u000a      perspective rather than in mainstream transition perspectives.

These\u000d\u000a      policies are implemented in the context of simultaneous government and\u000d\u000a      market failures and thus, he argues, require new approaches rooted in\u000d\u000a      system and capability failures.\u000d\u000a    Focusing on the capacity of these economies to generate indigenous\u000d\u000a      innovation and absorb foreign technology, Radosevic has examined several\u000d\u000a      areas involved in the transformation of innovation systems in the region:\u000d\u000a      the creation of a knowledge-based economy [e]; the transformation and\u000d\u000a      performance of research and development (R&amp;D) [c]; industrial\u000d\u000a      upgrading and industrial networks [f]; links between science and industry\u000d\u000a      [b; d]; innovation policy [a]; and wider European links [f]. He has\u000d\u000a      explored these issues in relation to the countries of post-socialist\u000d\u000a      Europe, with special reference to central Europe (Hungary, Czech Republic)\u000d\u000a      Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and South-East Europe. In 2011, Radosevic,\u000d\u000a      co-edited a volume exploring innovation policy issues in the EU from a\u000d\u000a      neo-Schumpeterian perspective. This included a chapter [a] offering new\u000d\u000a      policy perspective and recommendations to improve innovation policy in the\u000d\u000a      CEE region. In particular, it shows how the implementation of a\u000d\u000a      neo-Schumpeterian perspective promotes policies which are country specific\u000d\u000a      depending on each country's distance from a technology frontier. This is a\u000d\u000a      substantially different perspective from the dominant focus on `best\u000d\u000a      practices policies' that permeates the EU and national CEE policies.\u000d\u000a    His continuous stream of high quality and policy relevant research has\u000d\u000a      brought Radosevic recognition as one of the leading European academic\u000d\u000a      specialists in innovation policy issues and as the leading expert for his\u000d\u000a      region of study. Through his neo-Schumpeterian perspective, Prof\u000d\u000a      Radosevic's research has revealed a neglected dimension of post-socialist\u000d\u000a      economic transformation. In particular, he has shown:\u000d\u000a    - how the transition process has affected R&amp;D and innovation capacity\u000d\u000a      in the economies of Central and Eastern Europe and elucidated its effects\u000d\u000a      on their long-term capacity to grow;\u000d\u000a    - how these countries have integrated into a wider European framework\u000d\u000a      through industrial networks, and the vital importance of an understanding\u000d\u000a      of the morphology of these networks to understanding patterns of and\u000d\u000a      potential for growth;\u000d\u000a    - how the innovation policies adopted by the countries of Central and\u000d\u000a      Eastern Europe over the last twenty years have been inadequate to promote\u000d\u000a      growth, and which alternative policy approaches are more conducive to\u000d\u000a      growth.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41914","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of De Grauwe's research can be observed at two levels:\u000a      influencing ECB's highly significant policy decision to become a lender of\u000a      last resort; and informing the wider policy debate on reforms of Eurozone\u000a      governance.\u000a    Influencing European Central Bank policy:\u000a    The ECB decided on 6 September 2012 to become a lender of last resort in\u000a      the government bond markets of the Eurozone. It accepted the key element\u000a      that was stressed by De Grauwe, i.e. that it will commit itself to\u000a      unlimited purchases of government bonds. It labelled this programme\u000a      \"Outright Monetary Transactions\" (OMT). The effect of this programme was a\u000a      quick stabilization of the government bond markets, as predicted by De\u000a      Grauwe [1].\u000a    In his 11 September column, the Financial Times' Chief Economics\u000a      Commentator Martin Wolf, considered one of the most influential writers on\u000a      economics &#8212; and himself a distingues economist &#8212; noted that this decision\u000a      \"marks belated acceptance of strong arguments made by the Belgian\u000a      economist Paul De Grauwe, at the London School of Economics\" [A].\u000a    Indeed, in justifying the decision of the ECB Governing Council, ECB\u000a      President Mario Draghi used the theory developed by De Grauwe [1] in\u000a      explaining that \"you have large parts of the euro area in a bad\u000a      equilibrium in which you may have self-fulfilling expectations that feed\u000a      on themselves...So, there is a case for intervening...to \"break\" these\u000a      expectations, which...do not concern only the specific countries, but the\u000a      euro area as a whole. And this would justify the intervention of the\u000a      central bank\" [B].\u000a    The ECB's decision came after experimenting with the \"Securities Market\u000a      Program\" (SMP) &#8212; a program of government bond purchases. However, the SMP\u000a      was explicitly designed to be limited in size and time. De Grauwe warned\u000a      that the limited nature of the bond purchase program would make it\u000a      ineffective [1]. This turned out to be correct, and the ECB decided to\u000a      abandon it.\u000a    Another design failure of the SMP was that the ECB insisted on having\u000a      seniority on the government bonds it acquired in the program. De Grauwe\u000a      warned that this would lead private holders of government bonds (who had\u000a      become junior and thus faced future losses) to sell their bonds, forcing\u000a      the ECB to buy large amounts of government bonds [2]. The ECB dropped its\u000a      seniority claim on the government bonds acquired under the OMT program.\u000a      This also suggests that De Grauwe has been influential in shaping\u000a      policies.\u000a    In addition, in 2012 the European Commission (DG ECFIN) proposed that De\u000a      Grauwe would provide consultancy services to inform the EU on how to deal\u000a      with the fragility of the Eurozone. More specifically he was asked how the\u000a      Eurozone design failures which led to the current fragility are to be\u000a      corrected, focusing on the long run conditions for making the Eurozone\u000a      sustainable. This research led to a first draft of a paper \"Design\u000a      Failures of the Eurozone. Can they be fixed?\" which was presented at a\u000a      workshop organized by the European Commission on 19th November\u000a      2012 (made available by LSE in 2013) [C].\u000a    Paul De Grauwe has since 2012 had a similar arrangement with the National\u000a      Bank of Belgium to help design common Eurobonds, another feature that De\u000a      Grauwe has stressed will be necessary to correct the design failures in\u000a      the Eurozone.\u000a    On 26 February 2013 Martin Wolf reviewed De Grauwe and Ji's paper [6] and\u000a      concluded that \"By adopting OMT earlier, the ECB could have prevented the\u000a      panic that drove the spreads that justified the austerity. It did not do\u000a      so. Tens of millions of people are suffering unnecessarily hardship. It is\u000a      tragic.\" [D] Despite these costs, Simon Tilford, Deputy Director and chief\u000a      economist of the Centre for European Reform, believes that \"Paul De\u000a      Grauwe's academic work has played a crucial role in stabilising the\u000a      eurozone. In particular, he showed that unsustainable borrowing costs in\u000a      struggling eurozone economies had little do with their mismanagement of\u000a      public finances and a lot to do with the absence of a central bank\u000a      prepared to act as lender of last resort to governments in times of\u000a      crisis. His research helped provided the intellectual cover needed by the\u000a      ECB, and in particular its President Mario Draghi, to face down opponents\u000a      of a more activist ECB, and take on these lender of last resort functions.\u000a      The announcement of the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) has\u000a      provided crucial breathing space for the euro\" [E]\u000a    Informing policy debate:\u000a    A key impact of the research of De Grauwe on the fragility of the\u000a      Eurozone is on the policy debate, where he has contributed significantly\u000a      to the quality of evidence and understanding of the major issues facing\u000a      the governance of the Eurozone. Media and public figures engaged in the\u000a      policy debate frequently cite De Grauwe's research when discussing the\u000a      Eurozone crisis. Paul Krugman has referred to De Grauwe's analysis on the\u000a      fragility of the Eurozone as a new way to analyse a monetary union [F], as\u000a      well as writing that \"Nobody has taught me as much about the euro crisis\u000a      as Paul De Grauwe, who brought to the fore the crucial point almost\u000a      everyone was overlooking: the importance of self-fulfilling debt panics in\u000a      countries that no longer have their own currencies. Now he has a new paper\u000a      with Yuemei Ji following up on that insight, and offering yet more\u000a      evidence of the incredible unwisdom of European economic policy\" [G].\u000a    The need for having a lender of last resort in the government bond\u000a      markets has also been stressed by Wyplosz [H], Delbecque [I], and Johnson\u000a      [J], among others. VoxEU, which is probably the major policy\u000a      discussion website, frequently cites De Grauwe's work [H,I]. De Grauwe has\u000a      also written seven articles posted on VoxEU, with \"Panic-driven austerity\u000a      in the Eurozone and its implications\" having over 140,000 'reads' [K].\u000a      (The other six articles range from approximately 4,200 to 134,000 reads.)\u000a    De Grauwe's proposal to issue common Eurobonds as an instrument for\u000a      reducing the Eurozone's fragility led to a debate in The Economist\u000a      in July 2012 on \"Mutualization of the debt\" between him and Professor\u000a      Ansgar Belke [L]. Moreover, De Grauwe's proposals to strengthen the\u000a      Eurozone have been discussed in many newspapers, including Lib&#233;ration,\u000a        Handelsblatt, Frankfurter Algemeiner, El Pais, Publico, New York Times,\u000a        Wall Street Journal, Republicca [e.g. M,N,O], and De Grauwe\u000a      has explained his views on television and radio in many countries . His\u000a      youtube video on the Eurozone crisis [P] has been watched by 3,590\u000a      viewers.\u000a    Martin Wolf believes that \"Prof De Grauwe's brilliant work has influenced\u000a      not only economic columnists, such as professor Krugman and myself, but\u000a      also many policymakers....All future work on cental banking in crises will\u000a      need to build upon [his] insights. In sum, no economist working in academe\u000a      or elsewhere has had more influence on the debate on the eurozone crisis\u000a      than professor De Grauwe\" [Q].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Paul De Grauwe developed and tested the theory that financial markets in\u000a      the Eurozone can push countries into a vicious circle of economic\u000a      recession, increasing government debt levels and banking crises in a\u000a      self-fulfilling way. One of the main policy conclusions of this analysis\u000a      is that the European Central Bank (ECB) is the only institution that can\u000a      prevent countries from being pushed into such a vicious circle. This can\u000a      be achieved by the ECB becoming the lender of last resort in the\u000a      government bond markets of the Eurozone.\u000a    After much hesitation the ECB accepted this analysis and decided in\u000a      September 2012 to become the lender of last resort in the government bond\u000a      markets of the Eurozone.

Following the Eurozone debt crisis that emerged\u000a      in 2010 and that culminated into a full-fledged existential crisis of the\u000a      Eurozone during 2011-12, Paul De Grauwe undertook theoretical research\u000a      which led to the publication of the influential paper \"The Governance of A\u000a      Fragile Eurozone\" in 2012 [1]. Professor De Grauwe has been John Paulson\u000a      Chair in European Political Economy at LSE since early 2012. The empirical\u000a      tests of the theory were undertaken together with Yuemei Ji of the\u000a      University of Leuven during 2012 and 2013 [5,6].\u000a    RESEARCH INSIGHTS AND OUTPUTS. The starting point of the\u000a      theoretical insights is that when countries join a monetary union they\u000a      lose the capacity to issue debt in their own currencies [1]. As a result,\u000a      they cannot give a guarantee to bond holders that the cash will always be\u000a      available to pay them out at maturity. This lack of guarantee makes the\u000a      member governments vulnerable to movements of fear and panic that in a\u000a      self-fulfilling way can create a liquidity crisis. The latter can\u000a      degenerate into a solvency crisis driving the country into a vicious\u000a      circle characterized by austerity, a recession and a banking crisis.\u000a      Economists call this a \"bad equilibrium\"\u000a    The conclusion of this theoretical analysis is that the ECB should be a\u000a      lender of last resort in the government bond markets of the Eurozone so as\u000a      to give a guarantee to bondholders that the liquidity to pay them out will\u000a      always be available. In doing so, the ECB can prevent fear and panic from\u000a      creating liquidity crises and thus stop countries from being pushed into a\u000a      bad equilibrium. The key element in this lender of last resort function is\u000a      that the ECB commits itself to buying unlimited amounts of government\u000a      bonds of individual member states.\u000a    Since the publication of this paper the research has been focused first\u000a      on the empirical verification of the theory. Together with Yuemei Ji, De\u000a      Grauwe found that the government bond rates of a number of Eurozone\u000a      countries were driven by market sentiments that were unrelated to\u000a      underlying fundamentals [5,6]\u000a    De Grauwe also analysed the conditions under which the lender of last\u000a      resort function of the ECB could be successful. These conditions are that\u000a      when the ECB commits itself to buying government bonds it should not\u000a      endanger price stability. It should also do it in a way as to minimize the\u000a      moral hazard that inevitably arises when it gives a guarantee. Finally, it\u000a      should recognise that lender of last resort operations have fiscal\u000a      implications. De Grauwe argued that the ECB can design its lender of last\u000a      resort operations to meet these conditions [2,3].\u000a    De Grauwe has stressed that while the Lender of Last Resort function of\u000a      the ECB is necessary to stabilize the Eurozone it is not sufficient. Other\u000a      reforms will have to be implemented (e.g. common Eurobond issues,\u000a      symmetric macroeconomic policies) to make the Eurozone sustainable in the\u000a      long run. Much of De Grauwe's research now focuses on the long run\u000a      conditions for successful governance of the Eurozone. This analysis is\u000a      also included in the most recent edition of his book The Economics of\u000a        Monetary Union [4], which has been translated into eight languages,\u000a      including French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42382","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Errant Mobility report was published on the EFUS (European Forum for\u000d\u000a      Urban Security, an EU-wide network of 300 local and regional authorities)\u000d\u000a      website and advertised through its listings.

They led to the\u000d\u000a      implementation of specific language translation and outreach services for\u000d\u000a      migrant sex workers in London and in the rest of the UK. Haringey Council\u000d\u000a      used the evaluation results to successfully argue for the need to hire\u000d\u000a      Romanian and Brazilian Portuguese speaking outreach workers. Mai's\u000d\u000a      research reinforced ECP's `priority as an organization to focus on\u000d\u000a      providing rights based information in various languages as well as in\u000d\u000a      English'. According to a representative of UKNSWP, `project feedback was\u000d\u000a      that that they had a greater understanding of the experiences of migrants\u000d\u000a      which could inform their outreach and support service provision to ensure\u000d\u000a      appropriate services were provided'.\u000d\u000a    The research informed and shifted public policies and media debates\u000d\u000a      towards a distinction between migrants' involvement in the sex industry\u000d\u000a      and trafficking (i.e. see Guardian article by Nick Davies on `Prostitution\u000d\u000a      and trafficking &#8212; the anatomy of a moral panic', 20 October 2009). The ECP\u000d\u000a      used the research in their campaign against the 2009 Policing and Crime\u000d\u000a      Act and `the increased criminalization of sex workers and the closures of\u000d\u000a      premises justified in the name of clamping down on trafficking'. Following\u000d\u000a      the launch of the research findings, Mai was consulted by the Association\u000d\u000a      of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) during the preparation of the `Setting the\u000d\u000a      Record' report, so far the only official police quantification of sex\u000d\u000a      trafficking in England and Wales, confirming that only a minority of\u000d\u000a      migrant sex workers are trafficked. The findings were presented at the\u000d\u000a      ACPO 2010 and at two of the UKNSWP yearly national conferences in 2009 and\u000d\u000a      2010. The research completed a tradition of participative and ethnographic\u000d\u000a      research engaging sex workers directly in identifying their needs and\u000d\u000a      priorities. It has `directly informed policy development at a national\u000d\u000a      level and informed support service practice across the UK' (UKNSWP\u000d\u000a      representative) and was pivotal in producing a forceful impact on current\u000d\u000a      UK government guidelines and strategies on trafficking, which are now\u000d\u000a      separate from those on prostitution and acknowledge that a minority of\u000d\u000a      migrants working in the sex industry are trafficked. The findings of the\u000d\u000a      research inform the influential 2012 report `Silence on Violence' on the\u000d\u000a      violence experienced by sex workers in London and on the way\u000d\u000a      anti-trafficking campaigns exacerbated their vulnerability. The report was\u000d\u000a      authored by a London GLA member, according to whom Mai's research `helps\u000d\u000a      both quantify and qualify' the `options and choices open to trafficked\u000d\u000a      people' and provided `invaluable' insight in an area characterised by\u000d\u000a      `little data'.\u000d\u000a    Mai's film `Normal' is informed by the combined findings of Mai's\u000d\u000a      research and was selected at the Raindance International Film Festival\u000d\u000a      2012.

According to the English\u000d\u000a      Collective of Prostitutes, a grass-roots organisation of sex workers with\u000d\u000a      a national network throughout the UK, by providing evidence on `the\u000d\u000a      complex lives that those of us who are immigrants working in the sex\u000d\u000a      industry live', Mai's research `gave immigrant sex workers a voice and a\u000d\u000a      face (...and...) helped people identify sex workers with other workers in\u000d\u000a      the informal sector and see between various battles to improve\u000d\u000a      occupational safety'.\u000d\u000a    Mai's work adopted an innovative methodological combination of\u000d\u000a      ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing, which included\u000d\u000a      peer researchers and organisations representing the rights of the social\u000d\u000a      groups being researched. Mai's research shows that by working in the sex\u000d\u000a      industry and engaging in other irregular economic activities most young\u000d\u000a      migrants, including minors, are able to achieve socio-economic and\u000d\u000a      psychological autonomy, which contributes to their resilience and\u000d\u000a      well-being. It also identifies psychological and socio-economic factors,\u000d\u000a      such as psychological dependency, the stigmatization of sex work, the lack\u000d\u000a      of legal migration status and socio-economic marginalization, which\u000d\u000a      strongly contribute to migrants' vulnerability in social and individual\u000d\u000a      terms. Mai's finding that anti-trafficking initiatives exacerbate the\u000d\u000a      vulnerability of migrant sex workers was valued and owned by grass-root\u000d\u000a      and other sex work support organisations, who underline how policies\u000d\u000a      should focus on `the under-reporting of violent and other crimes committed\u000d\u000a      against sex workers' (UKNSWP representative). A representative of the\u000d\u000a      IUSW, the International Union of Sex Workers, launched and endorsed the\u000d\u000a      findings of the ESRC project by underlining that `we will only\u000d\u000a      successfully target trafficking within the sex industry when we make\u000d\u000a      policy based on evidence and in reality'. According to the director of the\u000d\u000a      NHS-funded Open Doors project supporting sex workers in East London,\u000d\u000a      `policy makers have to take into account a well-respected study that\u000d\u000a      challenges the concepts on which they have built policy, listened to\u000d\u000a      ideological rhetoric and generally taken an over-simplistic view of the\u000d\u000a      sex industry'.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42383","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research carried out for the UK Health and Safety Executive resulted\u000a      in changes in its recording of accidents at work; the establishment by the\u000a      HSE of a migrant workers website (http:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk\/migrantworkers\/worker.htm)\u000a      designed to provide essential information, guidance and advice on\u000a      workplace health and safety for workers from overseas and their employers.\u000a      The HSE also now employs five health and safety officers with a direct\u000a      remit on investigating health and safety in workplaces where migrants are\u000a      employed.

There is also a greater awareness of how\u000a        enforcement measures, by bodies such as the UK Border Agency, have been\u000a        influenced by race discrimination as witnessed by their focus on closing\u000a        ethnic businesses.'

Her research combines\u000a      qualitative and quantitative methods. She has used film as a medium of\u000a      research, with a film `All By Ourselves' which was presented at a\u000a      number of public events, including at the Museum of London. Stakeholder\u000a      engagement is present in a large number of her projects through Project\u000a      Advisory Groups, which in turn have led to the establishment of\u000a      longer-term networks. In her most recent project on undocumented migrants\u000a      she is using asynchronous focus groups as a method of reaching employers\u000a      in ethnic enclave employment. This is specifically aimed at preserving\u000a      anonymity in environments where workers who are undocumented may be\u000a      employed. The research has identified the many ways in which migrant\u000a      workers, and particularly undocumented migrants, are more likely to be at\u000a      risk in employment, in terms of precarity, and of health and safety. It\u000a      suggests that new forms of employment relationship are emerging from\u000a      reliance on migrant labour. The positive outcome of this in the UK is that\u000a      some employers are adopting a social care model in relation to migrant\u000a      employees, and addressing their needs in terms of accommodation, language\u000a      learning, cultural support and so on. Her research in twelve European\u000a      countries (for DG Employment) confirms that precarity is associated with\u000a      migration status, and is concentrated in some ethnic groups, as well as\u000a      being related to age and lack of qualifications. She has also identified\u000a      growth in informal working, and increasing precarity as the economic\u000a      crisis deepens. In her FP6 project, carried out in seven European\u000a      countries, McKay found a convergence of approaches to immigration policy,\u000a      with increasing numbers of expulsions and controls on who can enter. The\u000a      outcome of this is an increase in numbers of undocumented workers and in\u000a      exploitation. In her project for the Health and Safety Executive in the UK\u000a      she found that there was a clear link between workers not complaining\u000a      about health and safety risks and undocumented status. Migrant workers\u000a      were also more at risk as they were younger and less knowledgeable about\u000a      possible risks associated with their work. Her interest in migration and\u000a      health has led to participation, with eight other university partners in\u000a      Europe, in an annual Erasmus-funded research student summer school on\u000a      global health and migration. This has involved university medical teaching\u000a      hospitals in five partner countries partnering with sociology faculties in\u000a      another four countries and has brought together 30 students each year from\u000a      the disciplines of medicine, sociology and law. Finally McKay's research\u000a      identified a clear link between long working hours and accidents at work.\u000a      She has recently won an ESRC grant to investigate how undocumented workers\u000a      rely on ethnically based networks to find work and survive; the HSE and\u000a      ACAS are on the Advisory Board of this project, which will therefore have\u000a      a direct connection with, and impact on policy makers.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42777","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"51537","Name":"Somalia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The culture of the Somalis is one in which oral poetry and song are\u000a      favoured forms of expression; indeed, the language was only first written\u000a      in an officially recognised script in 1972. Virtually every town has its\u000a      bards and the making, copying, selling and exchange of cassettes and now\u000a      digital media featuring versions of the most popular poems. Recitations\u000a      are an important aspect of daily life. Both in the Somali territories and\u000a      in the diaspora, discussion of poetry and literary debate are regular\u000a      features of Somali language press and media.\u000a    The inherent challenges of the English translation of Somali poetry are\u000a      various &#8212; the need for a sophisticated command of both languages and an\u000a      understanding of subject matter drawn from a radically different culture,\u000a      a knowledge of the political and clan and sub-clan affiliations and\u000a      tensions that shape contemporary Somali life in addition to a\u000a      comprehension of the complex of formal characteristics and modalities that\u000a      condition Somali poetry. Dr Orwin`s extensive research and fieldwork,\u000a      command of the Somali language, connections in Somali communities and\u000a      desire to create elegant, effectual works in English that move beyond\u000a      literal translations have made him, perhaps uniquely, capable of producing\u000a      such high-calibre, well-informed translations that have attracted the\u000a      interest and respect of Anglophone and Somali audiences alike.\u000a    Many of Dr Orwin`s translations of Somali poetry are freely available\u000a      from online resources. His translations of nine Somali poems are on the\u000a      Poetry World Map (1 and 11, below), a project sponsored by City Lore, an\u000a      arts advocacy organisation in New York and partially funded by the US\u000a      National Endowment for the Arts.

The volume features Dr Orwin`s \"Introduction to\u000a      the English Translations\", highlighting the formal characteristics of\u000a      Somali poetry and translations done together by him and Somali poetry\u000a      connoisseur Maxamed Xasan `Alto`. Alastair Whitson of the organisation\u000a      Progressio, said of War and Peace (10):\u000a    \"War and Peace' was far more than just a poetry anthology. Our work in\u000a        Somaliland involved supporting peace-building and strengthening civil\u000a        society in a post-conflict state. The process of writing down and\u000a        collecting oral literature enabled participants to capture and reflect\u000a        on experiences of and strategies for peace-building in Somali society.\u000a        This process itself helped build social cohesion, while the publication\u000a        in a carefully edited and explicated edition served to celebrate the\u000a        resilience and potential togetherness of the people of Somaliland.\u000a        Significantly, the collaboration with co-publisher Red Sea Online\u000a        ensured the anthology reached a broad audience among the Somali\u000a        diaspora, who are the main supporters of nation-building and\u000a        peace-building in the territory of Somaliland. The book's messages also\u000a        gain a regular local audience through Red Sea Online's support for the\u000a        annual Hargeisa Book Fair, which is seen as a significant socio-\u000a        cultural event in Somaliland and highlights the prominent role of\u000a        literature, and literary dialogue, in Somali society.\"\u000a    In the UK, eleven of Dr Orwin`s translations, resulting from\u000a      collaborations with Somali and Anglophone poets are available on the\u000a      Poetry Translation Centre website (3). Dr Orwin`s work for the Poetry\u000a      Translation Centre in particular has successfully attracted the interest\u000a      of a larger community of interested translators and poets who have also\u000a      begun working to translate Somali poems into English. Sarah Maguire of the\u000a      Poetry Translation Centre (PTC) (4):\u000a    \"In 2008 Dr Orwin co-translated a further selection of Gaarriye's\u000a        poems with British poet W. N. Herbert, that was published as a\u000a        dual-language chapbook by the PTC. Since then he has acted as an\u000a        invaluable consultant (...), a partnership that has led to the\u000a        translation and publication of the young woman poet, Caasha Lul Mohammad\u000a        Yusuf, and to translation and publication in book form of the greatest\u000a        living Somali poet, Maxamed Ibraahin Warsame 'Hadraawi', a world-class\u000a        poet who is revered by his people and who is known as the 'Somali\u000a        Shakespeare'.\u000a    Without Dr Orwin's contribution, the PTC would not be the success that\u000a        it is today. In addition, through him, many non-Somali speakers have\u000a        been introduced to the brilliance of Somali poetry and countless Somalis\u000a        have been able to meet their most admired poets and read their poetry in\u000a        excellent English translation. Few other academics working in the\u000a        humanities can have had such a broad-reaching, decisive impact on\u000a        communities beyond the academy.\"\u000a    Dissemination of Dr Orwin`s research and translations has been achieved\u000a      through participation in radio programmes and high-profile cultural events\u000a      and through extended interviews about his work on metre in Somali poetry\u000a      available on YouTube. In 2010, Orwin joined host Rageh Omar and a London\u000a      Somali poet on The Bards of Somalia (5), a BBC 4 programme\u000a      broadcasted twice in August, a month with weekly listening figures of\u000a      10,368,000 (RAJAR) (6). London-based poet Abdullahi Botan Hassan, with\u000a      Orwin`s help, made a translation of Shakespeare`s sonnet XII, which was\u000a      performed by Yusra Warsama at the Globe Theatre`s free multilingual event\u000a      `Sonnet Sunday` in which 154 Shakespearean sonnets were performed in more\u000a      than 20 languages. For the 2012 Cultural Olympiad`s week-long `Poetry\u000a      Parnassus,` which featured a performance of a poem from each of the 204\u000a      Olympic nations, Orwin provided the translation of Central London,\u000a      a poem written and performed by (Abdullahi Botan) Hassan. The same\u000a      translation was also printed on some of the 100,000 bookmarks dropped from\u000a      a helicopter on the Southbank at the start of the event, and is featured\u000a      in The World Record: International Voices from Southbank Centre's\u000a        Poetry Parnassus (7, 8). An interview with a member of the\u000a      Somali community in London in which Orwin discusses his work has had more\u000a      than 10,000 views on YouTube since it was uploaded in January 2010 (9).\u000a    For more than 10 years Dr Orwin has also regularly contributed to a range\u000a      of cultural and educational events sponsored by members of the Somali\u000a      community in London and beyond. This has included the largest annual\u000a      Somali community event in London, Somali Week, which showcases Somali\u000a      poetry, music and theatre. At the 2012 event, for example, Orwin took part\u000a      in a panel discussion celebrating the 40th anniversary of the\u000a      official Somali writing system. In collaboration with the Somali Youth\u000a      Development Resource Centre in Kentish Town and Soohan Arts, an\u000a      organisation working with schools in Camden, Orwin has delivered a number\u000a      of talks on poetry and Somali language (on one occasion even presenting\u000a      children with a Somali Language poem of his own). In recognition of these\u000a      and other contributions, in 2010 Orwin was awarded the London Somali\u000a      Community`s Haya Prize for his Outstanding Contribution to the Somali\u000a      Language.\u000a    In all these activities, Orwin has endeavoured to communicate and promote\u000a      the positive elements of Somali culture &#8212; a culture cleaved and crushed by\u000a      war, famine and displacement on a massive scale &#8212; whose refugee\u000a      populations are often marginalised and even maligned in their new host\u000a      scountries. It is in these endeavours, all too unique, that he has made a\u000a      difference to how Somalis are perceived by the wider world and encouraged\u000a      Somalis, and particularly those too often disaffected in the global\u000a      diaspora, to cherish their contributions to world literature.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The primacy of oral poetry to Somali culture cannot be overstated: It is\u000a      the primary form of cultural communication and the foremost vehicle\u000a      through which Somali history, cultural values and contemporary concerns\u000a      are expressed and transmitted. Through his pioneering analysis and\u000a      sensitive translation into English of classical and contemporary Somali\u000a      poems, Dr Martin Orwin has brought Somali poetry to the attention of\u000a      Anglophone audiences, participating in web-accessible poetry projects and\u000a      prominent events such as `Sonnet Sunday` and `Poetry Parnassus`.

He is currently the only full-time academic teaching Somali and\u000a      Amharic languages and literatures in a UK university. His research on the\u000a      subject of Somali poetry, of which a brief selection of underpinning\u000a      publications is listed below, has sought above all to understand how\u000a      Somali poetry is crafted as an aesthetic object. To this end, Dr Orwin\u000a      researches the formal characteristics of varied styles of classical and\u000a      contemporary Somali poetry, including its complex metrical patterns (each\u000a      of which are most often exclusive to a particular style or thematic\u000a      category of poetry), the recurring use of consonant sounds and\u000a      alliteration.\u000a    In support of this research, Dr Orwin has undertaken much field work in\u000a      the Somali territories, particularly in and around Hargeysa, where on one\u000a      occasion he apprenticed the celebrated Somali poet Mahamed 'Gaarriye' for\u000a      more than two months following a strict programme of word-for-word\u000a      memorisation of varied genres of poems, repeated recitations and detailed\u000a      formal analyses. During this experience, Dr Orwin became privy to many of\u000a      Gaarriye`s own insights into the metrical patterns of Somali poetry and\u000a      together they co-authored output b below, `Virtual Geminates in the Metre\u000a      of Somali Poetry`.\u000a    Indeed, such collaboration is vital to Dr Orwin`s approach to both\u000a      researching and translating Somali poetry, and has resulted in original\u000a      publications often advancing interpretations of aspects of the formal\u000a      analysis of Somali poetry for the first time in any language, of which the\u000a      above articles co-authored with Gaarriye as well as a, e and f are\u000a      examples. In relation to the metrics of Somali poetry, heated debate in\u000a      Somali language media has surrounded the genesis of two variant\u000a      interpretations of Somali metre, one of which is that first presented by\u000a      Mahamed 'Gaarriye' which Dr Orwin has shown to be the most correct and\u000a      insightful approach and also the first to be published.\u000a    All of Dr Orwin`s translation work has necessarily involved the\u000a      collaboration of native speakers, poets and poetry enthusiasts in the\u000a      Somali territories and the diaspora and, occasionally, Anglophone poets as\u000a      well. In part, close collaborations with Somalis are crucial to producing\u000a      translations that convey and chronicle the very different cultures,\u000a      lifestyles and concerns described in Somali poetry. For example, aspects\u000a      of nomadic, pastoralist existence are often eulogised in Somali poetry,\u000a      and metaphors drawn from the intricacies of camel husbandry appear with\u000a      notable frequency. And it is this cultural awareness and sensitivity\u000a      wrought through intensive field work and collaboration with Somalis in\u000a      their own language that set Dr Orwin`s translations apart.\u000a    An example of Dr Orwin`s translation, Cabdulqaadir Xaaji Cali Axmed`s Samadoon,\u000a      can be found here: http:\/\/www.poetrymagazines.org.uk\/magazine\/record.asp?id=12336\u000a      [Most recently accessed 25.11.13].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42779","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Through extensive research into African film, combined with her founding,\u000a      organizing and curating of African film festivals over the past twelve\u000a      years, Dovey has developed a keen appreciation of the difficulties faced\u000a      by African filmmakers given Hollywood's dominance in the international\u000a      film market. Dovey's academic and non-academic work is preoccupied with\u000a      how such an imbalance can be rectified and how African filmmakers might be\u000a      assisted in garnering wider audiences.\u000a    Dovey has sought to address these concerns primarily through founding and\u000a      curating two of the UK's leading African film festivals: the Cambridge\u000a      African film festival, the longest-running annual African film festival in\u000a      the UK, launched in 2002, and Film Africa in London, which has grown to be\u000a      the UK's largest annual celebration of African cinema and culture (1). In\u000a      addition to co-founding Film Africa in 2008, Dovey acted as Co-Director\u000a      (with Namvula Rennie) and Film Programme Director in 2011 and 2012,\u000a      devoting six months each year to its planning, programming, and delivery\u000a      alongside her academic role at SOAS. Her in-depth knowledge of filmmaking\u000a      across Africa enabled the design of a diverse programme that brought\u000a      African cinematic achievements to an international audience. In 2011,\u000a      Dovey brought 51 African films and 10 African filmmakers to Film Africa;\u000a      in 2012, the programme expanded to include over 70 African films and 30\u000a      filmmakers, as well as education and arts workshops. Through her contacts\u000a      in the film industry developed over a decade of work, Dovey secured\u000a      substantial funding as well as high-profile London venues for the\u000a      festival, such as the BFI Southbank and the Ritzy in Brixton. Box office\u000a      figures reveal that audience numbers increased by 90%, from 2000 people in\u000a      2011 to 3800 in 2012.\u000a    Film Africa has garnered much media attention, with reports and reviews\u000a      in, for example, The Guardian (2), Time Out, Metro\u000a      and on CNN International (3, 4) and the BBC World Service; Dovey has been\u000a      interviewed, for example, on CNN, Radio 4, BBC London News (5) and BBC\u000a      Network Africa.\u000a    The festival has had extremely positive impacts on African filmmakers,\u000a      affording them significant international publicity and enabling them to\u000a      broker deals for mainstream distribution (e.g. the films The Athlete\u000a      and Otelo Burning secured distribution thanks to the festival).\u000a      The winner of the festival's 2011 Silver Baobab Award for Best Short Film,\u000a      believes that the press attention attracted by the award led to her BAFTA\u000a      nomination, while the &#163;2,000 prize money allowed her to work on her next\u000a      script (6):\u000a    \"It's the first time I got to take part in a real press junket. In the\u000a        end it got me a spot on CNN and BBC World radio and I couldn't have\u000a        asked for more publicity and I think this helped considerably -\u000a        especially leading up to the BAFTA votes!\"\u000a    South African director of the documentary Surfing Soweto, said\u000a      (7):\u000a    \"I have travelled around the world extensively with my film\u000a      Surfing Soweto last year but I have to say my experience at Film Africa\u000a        was by far the best. Lindiwe and Namvula really catered to our needs as\u000a        African filmmakers and had a really deep understanding of the problems\u000a        we face when we try and get our films distributed abroad. The\u000a        discussions, workshops, presentations and networking opportunities were\u000a        really right on point and tackled these issues head on (...). In actual\u000a        fact they also do seem to be paying off because my film will be screened\u000a        in the UK later in the year. And this is in no small part thanks to the\u000a        contacts I made while there (...). I honestly cannot speak more highly\u000a        of my experience in London.\"\u000a    Feedback from a Nigerian director, who participated in Film Africa 2012,\u000a      was equally positive (8):\u000a    \"I went away from Film Africa 2012 with great hope and optimism for\u000a        African cinema, particularly the role Nigeria is destined to play in a\u000a        couple of years...

The results are\u000a        beginning to manifest as acquisition contacts are already showing\u000a        interest in my film. I am happy I did not miss Film Africa 2012, which\u000a        has further inspired me and fuelled my desire to make greater films\".\u000a    Dovey's work with Film Africa constitutes a significant contribution to\u000a      promoting African culture in the UK, thereby enhancing international\u000a      public awareness and engagement with African film. Her path-breaking\u000a      research has greatly informed her conceptualisation of Film Africa,\u000a      shaping programmes that showcase the complexity of African film and\u000a      alternative narratives about Africa, by Africans.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    African filmmakers have long experienced difficulties in funding,\u000a      exhibiting and distributing their work, reflecting the dominance of\u000a      Hollywood and `mainstream' cinema.

Upon completing her PhD at Cambridge in 2005, she\u000a      held a Mellon Research Fellowship in Film, before joining SOAS in 2007 as\u000a      Lecturer in African Film and Performance Arts. She was promoted to Senior\u000a      Lecturer in 2010. Her research focuses on African literary film\u000a      adaptations and cultural appropriation, postcolonial film and music, and\u000a      the processes and dynamics of African film production, distribution and\u000a      exhibition both in and outside Africa. Alongside academic publication,\u000a      Dovey has made several short films and documentaries.\u000a    In 2009, Dovey published her first monograph, the first book in English\u000a      to explore the phenomenon of African literary film adaptations, African\u000a        Film and Literature: Adapting Violence to the Screen. Focusing on\u000a      South Africa and francophone West Africa, Dovey explores how filmmakers\u000a      have used adaptations to critique colonial and contemporary violence. She\u000a      argues that, through their sophisticated analyses of different forms of\u000a      violence in Africa, African filmmakers contribute to a wider critique of\u000a      violence and the stereotypes underpinning notions of an inherently violent\u000a      Africa. Dovey's extensive analysis of a wide range of films brings a fresh\u000a      and original perspective to African Film Studies and Adaption Studies\u000a      through its combination of close, critical readings of films and\u000a      interpretation of the narratives based on their historical and\u000a      socio-political contexts. Moreover, Dovey's book, informed by her own\u000a      experience of filmmaking and curating, examines the many obstacles that\u000a      hinder film production, distribution and exhibition across Africa, and the\u000a      power structures within the international film market that determine what\u000a      films get shown and valued.\u000a    In 2010, Dovey edited a special issue of the Journal of African\u000a        Cultural Studies, entitled `African Film and Video: Pleasure,\u000a      Politics and Performance', for which she also wrote the editorial and\u000a      co-authored an article, \"'African Jim': Sound, Politics, and\u000a      Pleasure in Early `Black' South African Cinema\", which uncovers a\u000a      previously-ignored political subtext to the 1949 South African film, as\u000a      conveyed through the film's aural\/oral aspects. The same year, she\u000a      co-authored another article, \"Bizet in Khayelitsha: U-Carmen\u000a        eKhayelitsha as Audio-visual Transculturation\" that, like output c,\u000a      saw her collaborate with a scholar of African music to provide an\u000a      interdisciplinary audio-visual analysis of the award-winning South African\u000a      film opera U-Carmen eKhayelitsha. The article featured in an issue\u000a      of the Journal of African Media Studies, which was also edited by\u000a      Dovey (output e).\u000a    More recently, Dovey has elaborated a feminist critique of African\u000a      filmmaking, a field in which very few African women have directed feature\u000a      films. She also notes the relative lack of attention to African women's\u000a      filmmaking in both scholarship and film programming, which serves in part\u000a      as a justification of her deliberate focus on `African Women Filmmakers'\u000a      in the programming of Film Africa 2011, a festival she founded and\u000a      co-directed (described in section four). She has complemented this work\u000a      and reflection with critique of male-authored films featured in the\u000a      Africa- themed programmes of leading film festivals (output f).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42781","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1252634","Name":"Bhutan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2007, over 80,000 Bhutanese refugees have been re-settled from\u000d\u000a      Nepali camps to several Western countries including the UK and US under\u000d\u000a      the auspices of a dedicated International Organisation for Migration\u000d\u000a      re-settlement programme.

A frequent visitor to the Himalaya, he has\u000d\u000a      published extensively on Nepali literature, culture, politics and the\u000d\u000a      Nepali diaspora more broadly, in addition to producing the definitive\u000d\u000a      translations of several key Nepali texts. Hutt is Chairman of the\u000d\u000a      Britain-Nepal Academic Council, and in April 2011 he received the Nai\u000d\u000a      Derukha International Award for promoting Nepali literature to the world.\u000d\u000a    Though his research focuses principally on Nepal, Hutt has also developed\u000d\u000a      an interest in contemporary Bhutanese politics and society, largely\u000d\u000a      stemming from a two-week visit to Bhutan in 1992 as a guest of the\u000d\u000a      Bhutanese government. Following this visit, he convened the first\u000d\u000a      international conference on Bhutan in an academic setting in March 1993 at\u000d\u000a      SOAS, bringing together members of the Bhutanese government with a diverse\u000d\u000a      selection of scholars. Featured conference papers were compiled by Hutt in\u000d\u000a      output d.\u000d\u000a    Through continued contact with conference participants, Hutt became\u000d\u000a      further aware of the plight of thousands of ethnic Nepalis who, having\u000d\u000a      been ousted from Bhutan where their families had resided for generations,\u000d\u000a      were living in UNHCR-administered refugee camps in Nepal. With the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the Bhutanese government's ethnically exclusive\u000d\u000a      nationalist project in the late 1980s that sought to rid the nation's\u000d\u000a      population of foreign influence, approximately half of the Nepali-speaking\u000d\u000a      Bhutanese population (called `Lhotshampa' in Bhutan) were forcibly evicted\u000d\u000a      or coerced through various means to leave their land in southern Bhutan.\u000d\u000a      They fled to refugee camps in Nepal where many still remain; by the late\u000d\u000a      1990s, an estimated 100,000 refugees occupied these camps. Hutt wrote\u000d\u000a      first about the refugee crisis in 1993 (output e) and subsequently visited\u000d\u000a      all five camps in Nepal on four separate occasions between 1995 and 2001.\u000d\u000a      His fluent Nepali enabled his extensive fieldwork that included extended\u000d\u000a      recorded interviews with refugees and often with the older among them who\u000d\u000a      could better recount the history of their families' migration to and life\u000d\u000a      in Bhutan. Hutt also examined refugees' personal documents and undertook\u000d\u000a      archival research at the British Library in order to trace the historical\u000d\u000a      pattern of Nepali settlement in Bhutan, and to clarify the processes by\u000d\u000a      which the Bhutanese government was able to withdraw citizenship from and\u000d\u000a      exile large numbers of Lhotshampa.\u000d\u000a    Hutt has since written numerous publications concerning the refugee\u000d\u000a      crisis, most notably his 2003 monograph Unbecoming Citizens: Culture,\u000d\u000a        Nationhood, and the Flight of Refugees from Bhutan.

During sanctions of the\u000a      1990s, academics were denied new books, access to journals and\u000a      opportunities to attend conferences or collaborate internationally. Since\u000a      2003, the situation for academics dramatically declined further with\u000a      destruction of infrastructure, brain-drain, targeted assassinations,\u000a      increasing sectarianism and a lack of training opportunities. In parallel,\u000a      the situation of women in Iraq has also worsened, as Al-Ali's own research\u000a      demonstrates. There have been increases in gender-based violence, women's\u000a      poverty, unemployment, legal discrimination, inadequate healthcare and\u000a      education and restrictions on movement and behaviour. Within academe,\u000a      female academics are systematically excluded from decision-making,\u000a      research training and professional advancement. Paradoxically, the\u000a      country's reconstruction requires &#8212; perhaps now more than ever &#8212; a robust\u000a      research base to inform policy and legislation; the lack thereof is\u000a      holding back advocacy and policy-making around women's education,\u000a      political and workforce participation and legal rights, frustrating the\u000a      country's potential to rebuild equitably and democratically.\u000a    Al-Ali has been working closely with female academics and women's rights\u000a      activists in Iraq for more than five years to improve the research\u000a      capacity of both individuals and institutions in ways that promote the\u000a      creation of an evidence base to better inform advocacy, lobbying, decision\u000a      and policy-making at local, national and international levels in relation\u000a      to women's rights. Al-Ali has spearheaded several initiatives to fulfil\u000a      these objectives, including Middle East Regional Roundtables on Gender\u000a      (RRTs) and a Research Fellowship Programme with the collaboration and\u000a      support of UK-based Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA) and the\u000a      Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Amman (1, 2 and 6, below).\u000a    Since 2010 Al-Ali has co-organised and participated in six Regional\u000a      Roundtables in Amman, Beirut and Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan (4). Each involves\u000a      20-35 participants of varied ethnic and religious backgrounds and\u000a      generations drawn from Iraqi academe and civil society organisations, and\u000a      academics and other stakeholders from across the Middle East. In November\u000a      2011, for example, a two-day RRT in Beirut involved six academics from\u000a      departments at the University of Baghdad, the Head of Political Science at\u000a      the University of Salahadeen in Erbil, and representatives from the\u000a      Baghdad Women Association (5), the Jordanian Women's Union and the\u000a      Beirut-based ABAAD Resource Centre for Gender Equality amongst others. The\u000a      events also provide an important networking opportunity and facilitate the\u000a      sharing of experiences of those in the wider region with their Iraqi\u000a      counterparts.\u000a    Al-Ali chairs the roundtables, which focus on gender and specific themes\u000a      drawn directly from her research such as \"Women Empowerment through\u000a      Research\" and \"Linking Civil Society and Academia: The Relevance of Women\u000a      and Gender Studies\". In June 2012, a highly-pragmatic RRT in Erbil\u000a      resulted in the creation of a working group tasked with preparing Iraq's\u000a      first ever Shadow Report responding to the Iraqi Government's 1998 CEDAW\u000a      (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\u000a      Women) Report to the UN. In June 2013 the working group submitted a\u000a      preliminary List of Issues to the CEDAW Committee in Geneva and the\u000a      following month sent a delegation to Geneva to present oral evidence. The\u000a      drafting of the Shadow Report is now underway.\u000a    Through the CARA-sponsored Iraq Research Fellowship Programme (IRFP),\u000a      with additional funding from DelPHe and UN Women, Al-Ali delivered\u000a      intensive, double-stranded training combining an introduction to the\u000a      concepts, theories and applications of gender studies, particularly with\u000a      reference to the specifics of the situation in Iraq and qualitative\u000a      research methods, such as interviewing techniques, participant\u000a      observations and life-story approaches (7, 8). On two projects each\u000a      involving four Iraqi or Iraqi-exiled academics, Al-Ali mentored teams\u000a      researching the problems and needs of female academics in higher education\u000a      in Iraq and making recommendations to improve the situation. Dissemination\u000a      of the resulting reports (outputs d and e) took place at the home\u000a      universities of the participants, attracting hundreds of audience members,\u000a      via online publication in English, Arabic and Kurdish, and, for one group,\u000a      the publication of an English-language book chapter, \"We Don't Do Numbers\"\u000a      in output f. Crucial to the projects' success was familiarising team\u000a      members with international research standards and ensuring participants\u000a      could employ qualitative research methods confidently and effectively in\u000a      the hundreds of interviews with Iraqi female academics that underpinned\u000a      the research.\u000a    The RRTs and IRFPs have developed strong, sustainable networks of\u000a      researchers and activists working on women's issues in Iraq and the\u000a      region. Both have also had very positive, unanticipated impacts: The\u000a      success of the RRTs on Gender have provided a model for new RRTs on social\u000a      sciences; IRPF participants have since successfully lobbied for a Gender\u000a      Unit at the University of Baghdad and been commissioned to undertake\u000a      further research by the Minister for Women. The success of the projects\u000a      also supported further successful fundraising initiatives including\u000a      garnering funds from the UN for more gender training and network building.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    More than twenty years of sanctions and war have decimated all areas of\u000a      Iraqi society, including its higher education sector. In this context, the\u000a      work of Professor Nadje Al-Ali has countered conservative forces pursuing\u000a      Iraqi reconstruction in ways that explicitly marginalise women. Drawing on\u000a      her research on women's rights in Iraq and beyond, Al-Ali has worked to\u000a      raise consciousness of how perspectives informed by gender theory can\u000a      contribute to a more equitable reconstruction of Iraqi civil society.\u000a      Through in-country and regional training of academics and women's rights\u000a      activists, and mentoring numerous Iraqi research projects, Al-Ali has\u000a      substantially progressed the promotion of women's rights and gender-based\u000a      equality in Iraq.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    SOAS\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"School of Oriental and African Studies","InstitutionName":"School of Oriental & African Studies","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007780}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"250441","Name":"Amman"},{"GeoNamesId":"276781","Name":"Beirut"},{"GeoNamesId":"2660646","Name":"Genève"},{"GeoNamesId":"98182","Name":"Baghdad"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aa.

She then held posts at Sussex and Exeter before returning to SOAS in\u000a      September 2007 as a lecturer in gender studies. The following year she\u000a      became Chair of the interdisciplinary Centre for Gender Studies at SOAS,\u000a      which, uniquely, promotes the study of gender in relation to Asia, Africa\u000a      and the Middle East. She became Professor in September 2010.\u000a    Al-Ali's work on gender in the Middle East, and particularly that\u000a      published while at SOAS since 2007, focuses on how war, conflict,\u000a      post-conflict reconstruction and political transition in Iraq have\u000a      negatively impacted on women. She authored the first modern history of\u000a      Iraqi women, Iraqi Women (output a below), a book that tracks the\u000a      political and social history of Iraq from the post-colonial period through\u000a      American invasion in 2003 and subsequent occupation. The emergence of a\u000a      women's movement in Iraq in the 1950s, Saddam Hussein's policy of state\u000a      feminism and the strengthening of conservative, Islamist forces in the\u000a      years either side of the turn of the 21st century are examined\u000a      successively &#8212; demonstrating that far from the `Liberation' touted in\u000a      Western propaganda, the invasion, war and occupation have in fact led to a\u000a      marked retrenchment of women's rights in Iraq.\u000a    The situation of women during the occupation, treated in the final\u000a      chapter of Iraqi Women, became a focus of collaboration with\u000a      Professor Nicola Pratt of Warwick, resulting in What Kind of\u000a        Liberation? (output b). This book extended and further evidenced the\u000a      argument that war and occupation and their attendant militarism, violence,\u000a      economic and social degradation, and mounting sectarianism and religious\u000a      zeal have dramatically worsened women's lives and short-term prospects of\u000a      equality in the country. The research hinges on interviews with Iraqi\u000a      women's rights activists, international policy makers and NGO workers,\u000a      highlighting an important feature of Al-Ali's research: The employment of\u000a      qualitative research methods that seek to chronicle the very human effects\u000a      of the increasing marginalisation of women from all areas of civil society\u000a      and political decision-making in Iraq, and chart how this occurs.\u000a    Broader, regionally focussed exploration of the effects of war on women's\u000a      lives in the Middle East was also pursued together with Pratt in the\u000a      co-edited Women and War in the Middle East (output c).\u000a    More recent research reports stem from projects working with women in\u000a      academe in Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan (outputs d and e), which Al-Ali has\u000a      co-authored with two sets of project participants. The process of\u000a      researching and drafting the reports enabled female Iraqi academics\u000a      themselves to investigate the ways in which gender has shaped their own\u000a      professional experience and the opportunity to set forth recommendations\u000a      to improve fairness and equitable treatment. Their dissemination at\u000a      authors' home institutions and beyond worked to increase awareness and\u000a      sensitivity of the issues facing female academics. These reports\u000a      illustrate the mutually reinforcing nature of Al-Ali's research and her\u000a      activism: One fuels the other, strengthening the impetus of each.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42802","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact has taken two main forms:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aAppointment as special advisor in public policy debates and\u000d\u000a        activities to enhance public\u000d\u000a        awareness of important policy initiatives at national, subregional and\u000d\u000a        wider regional i.e. the\u000d\u000a        EU) levels.

In\u000d\u000a      terms of impact, it is apposite to distinguish three main, albeit related\u000d\u000a      and complimentary, themes\u000d\u000a      of the work.\u000d\u000a    First, the political and economic significance of subregional economic\u000d\u000a      integration and its\u000d\u000a      evolution and dynamics. This research focused primarily on the Central\u000d\u000a      European Free Trade\u000d\u000a      Agreement (CEFTA). The various studies identified important interactions\u000d\u000a      between integration in\u000d\u000a      CEFTA and EU pre-accession and demonstrated that subregional integration\u000d\u000a      processes were a\u000d\u000a      bona fide element of the broader EU accession effort. The first published\u000d\u000a      piece appeared in a\u000d\u000a      policy-oriented collection published in a CEFTA country (Czech Republic).\u000d\u000a      The 2000 monograph\u000d\u000a      Subregional Economic Cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe: The\u000d\u000a        Political Economy of\u000d\u000a        CEFTA (Reference 6) was the first &#8212; and only &#8212; major\u000d\u000a      English-language study of CEFTA. It\u000d\u000a      remains the key point of reference for academics and practitioners\u000d\u000a      currently involved with CEFTA.\u000d\u000a      Subsequent research covered CEFTA's evolution until the 2004 EU\u000d\u000a      enlargement. This was\u000d\u000a      disseminated in key academic sources such as the Journal of European\u000d\u000a        Integration (2004),\u000d\u000a      Perspectives on European Politics and Society (2002) along with\u000d\u000a      chapters in edited collections.\u000d\u000a    Second, and essentially a sub-strand of the work on CEFTA, the emphasis\u000d\u000a      on subregional\u000d\u000a      cooperation in the Western Balkans. The following topics were covered: the\u000d\u000a      shift of CEFTA's\u000d\u000a      centre of gravity and reconfiguration &#8212; as 'CEFTA 2006' - as a South East\u000d\u000a      European subregional\u000d\u000a      economic integration framework; the role of other Central European\u000d\u000a      subregional organizations,\u000d\u000a      including the VG and Central European Initiative (CEI) in the Western\u000d\u000a      Balkans; the links between\u000d\u000a      subregional cooperation and EU integration efforts in the Western Balkan\u000d\u000a      setting and the specific\u000d\u000a      context of strong distrust of resistance to cross-border cooperation\u000d\u000a      between former Yugoslav\u000d\u000a      states. The findings were published in References 3 and 5. The research\u000d\u000a      was also disseminated\u000d\u000a      directly to the region, including the contribution to Reic's edited volume\u000d\u000a      (Reference 4) and the\u000d\u000a      presentation (as invited expert) entitled `Results and experience of\u000d\u000a      \"CEFTA 1993\" &#8212; lessons for\u000d\u000a      \"CEFTA 2006\"?', at the Round Table on Regional Cooperation and the\u000d\u000a        Future of CEFTA, Europe\u000d\u000a      House, Zagreb, Croatia, October 2007. See http:\/\/www.imo.hr\/node\/433.\u000d\u000a    The third strand also developed in the context of the impact of the 2004\u000d\u000a      EU enlargement. In\u000d\u000a      2004 Dangerfield was awarded a British Academy research grant to\u000d\u000a      investigate the impact of EU\u000d\u000a      enlargement on CEFTA, the VG and the CEI. This project opened up new\u000d\u000a      avenues of subsequent\u000d\u000a      investigation. In particular, the focus on the Visegrad Group and its\u000d\u000a      foreign policy cooperation vis-&#224;-vis\u000d\u000a      `eastern neighbours' of the EU, which demonstrated both the value-added\u000d\u000a      and limitations of\u000d\u000a      this dimension VG of cooperation.

This research\u000d\u000a      informed and will influence\u000d\u000a      their policing practice: 'Allum's research 'inform[ed] the way we look at\u000d\u000a      these groups which should\u000d\u000a      encourage us to include the white collar facilitators as well as the\u000d\u000a      criminal\u000d\u000a      fraternity' (D).\u000d\u000a    (3) She has had regular meetings with representatives from different law\u000d\u000a      enforcement agencies\u000d\u000a      (for example, Thames Valley Police, Italian Financial Police, Antimafia\u000d\u000a      police (DIA, Rome) and\u000d\u000a      Naples Prosecution service) to discuss her on-going research and its\u000d\u000a      implications for them. To\u000d\u000a      summarise, the interaction and dialogue with law enforcement agencies has\u000d\u000a      been an on-going two\u000d\u000a      way process in this research. It benefited both partners as it informed\u000d\u000a      the research and provided\u000d\u000a      new insights for them. As a top Italian Antimafia police officer noted:\u000d\u000a      Allum's 'analysis and\u000d\u000a      published work are enhancing our understanding of these evolving\u000d\u000a      phenomena.

(E)\u000d\u000a    (4) She was interviewed for the Journal Police Professional in an\u000d\u000a      article entitled 'Territorial\u000d\u000a      challenges' (Feb 28, 2013) to explain her research.

It has extended the range\u000d\u000a      and improved the quality\u000d\u000a      of evidence to enhance Italian, British and European general public\u000d\u000a      understanding of the major\u000d\u000a      issues relating to organised crime and the Neapolitan Camorra in Italy and\u000d\u000a      Europe. In particular,\u000d\u000a      her work informed the work of screenwriter, filmmaker and novelist Ben\u000d\u000a      Hopkins in his film Naples\u000d\u000a      Open City 1943-1948 (tigerlilyfilms). In 2009, this documentary was\u000d\u000a      distributed on mainstream TV\u000d\u000a      channels in UK (BBC 2, BBC 4), Arte (Germany\/France) and tsr in\u000d\u000a      Switzerland. She advised on\u000d\u000a      whom to interview as well as what to stress and highlight: 'I read Felia\u000d\u000a      Allum's work on organised\u000d\u000a      crime in Naples, which was very influential in forming my ideas about the\u000d\u000a      complex social and\u000d\u000a      economic situation in post-war Naples' (A).\u000d\u000a    (2) Allum's research came to the attention of the BBC Radio 4 programme 'Thinking\u000d\u000a        Allowed' (radio\u000d\u000a      audience of around 990,000 per edition, 250,000 people per month who\u000d\u000a      subscribe to the podcast\u000d\u000a      and another 100,000 who listen again via the I-player). She was\u000d\u000a      interviewed twice to explain\u000d\u000a      various aspects of her research. In August 2012, she contributed to a\u000d\u000a      debate on the Italian family,\u000d\u000a      the Neapolitan Family and the Camorra family: 'Her expertise and\u000d\u000a      experience meant she was able\u000d\u000a      to give a perspective on the role of the family in Italian life that I was\u000d\u000a      not able to get from anyone\u000d\u000a      else, despite speaking to many social scientists both in the UK and in\u000d\u000a      Italy [...]. I was extremely\u000d\u000a      pleased to be able to include her in our programme' (B). In February 2013\u000d\u000a      (6\/2\/13, 4.00-4.30 pm),\u000d\u000a      she participated to a debate on 'Organised crime in the UK' with Professor\u000d\u000a      D. Hobbs (Essex\u000d\u000a      University) where she presented her findings on the Neapolitan Camorra in\u000d\u000a      the UK. By being\u000d\u000a      interviewed on mainstream British radio, Allum's research informed the\u000d\u000a      British general debate\u000d\u000a      about the state of Italian families and their relationship with criminal\u000d\u000a      families as well the presence,\u000d\u000a      activities and harms the Italian organised crime groups pose the UK and\u000d\u000a      Europe.\u000d\u000a    (3) Allum's research on the fight against organised crime has also\u000d\u000a      informed the public's\u000d\u000a      understanding of the problem. Her work has been quoted in various\u000d\u000a      articles: (a) on the Italian State\u000d\u000a      witness protection programme ('Italy's secret anti-mob weapon: witness\u000d\u000a      protection', 14\/10\/12,\u000d\u000a      distributed to main US news distributors: abcnews.com, newtimes.com,\u000d\u000a      myfoxchicago.com,\u000d\u000a      newsyahoo.com, newsday.com, bloomberg businessweek.com) and (b) in The\u000d\u000a        Telegraph on\u000d\u000a      9\/1\/2010: 'Italy claims finally defeating the mafia' (by Nick Squires,\u000d\u000a      daily circulation of the\u000d\u000a      Telegraph: 634,113, July 2011). This shows that different aspects of her\u000d\u000a      research have been used\u000d\u000a      to engage more broadly in the general debate on the fight against\u000d\u000a      organised crime in Italy.\u000d\u000a    (4) Allum's research has provoked a debate among those working in the\u000d\u000a      area of policing in the UK.\u000d\u000a      She wrote an opinion piece for the Journal, Policing 'Italian\u000d\u000a      Organised crime in the UK' was\u000d\u000a      published in December 2012 and prompted a reply by Gachevska, K.

A reply 'Italian Organised crime\u000d\u000a      in the UK: continuing the\u000d\u000a      debate?' was subsequently published in Policing (Jan, 2013, 7 (2):\u000d\u000a      227-232). As a result of her\u000d\u000a      academic work, Allum was asked to contribute to 'Policing UK 2013'\u000d\u000a      on the topic of 'organised\u000d\u000a      crime' (edited by P. Neyroud, Witan, 2013) to present her thoughts. As\u000d\u000a      already noted, this led to\u000d\u000a      her being interviewed for the Journal Police Professional in an\u000d\u000a      article entitled 'Territorial challenges'\u000d\u000a      (Feb 28, 2013).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    According to the Home Office's 2009 report on organised crime, Extending\u000d\u000a        our Reach, A\u000d\u000a        Comprehensive Approach to tackling Organised Crime, serious\u000d\u000a      organised crime is perceived as a\u000d\u000a      local problem by British citizens.

Her research enhances and often\u000d\u000a      counters the existing\u000d\u000a      literature because it applies a simple 'structure and agency' approach to\u000d\u000a      analysing organised crime\u000d\u000a      combined with rich use of empirical data (in-depth interviews with police\u000d\u000a      officers, judges and state\u000d\u000a      witnesses). The predominant theories applied to understanding and\u000d\u000a      analysing Italian organised\u000d\u000a      crime either focus on cultural explanations (organised crime groups are\u000d\u000a      the by-product of a\u000d\u000a      particular culture) or rational choice theory (such groups are 'an\u000d\u000a      industry of private protection'\u000d\u000a      providing services of protection where the state is missing). Based on\u000d\u000a      empirical case studies and\u000d\u000a      extensive fieldwork, Allum's approach highlights the necessity to go\u000d\u000a      beyond cultural and economic\u000d\u000a      approaches.\u000d\u000a    This research on the Camorra, in Naples and abroad, breaks free from\u000d\u000a      traditional approaches to\u000d\u000a      adopt an innovative one that has not so far been adopted to explain such\u000d\u000a      criminal behaviour.\u000d\u000a      Allum's `structure and agency' approach is inspired by Giddens (1996) and\u000d\u000a      seeks to explain the\u000d\u000a      interaction between the micro-or individual level and the macro-or\u000d\u000a      contextual level of analysis. In\u000d\u000a      this fashion, an explanatory balance is introduced to give equal space to\u000d\u000a      the individual's behaviour\u000d\u000a      and the specific context within which it occurs. This approach enables a\u000d\u000a      better understanding of\u000d\u000a      the development of the Camorra in the post war period. In particular, it\u000d\u000a      allows a better analysis of\u000d\u000a      the Camorra's links with local political elites. This dynamic two level\u000d\u000a      approach allows for some\u000d\u000a      novel considerations about the intricate relationships between organised\u000d\u000a      criminals, local politicians,\u000d\u000a      businessmen and administrators in local Italian councils.\u000d\u000a    Allum's application of this approach to the Camorra's mobility abroad\u000d\u000a      also produced some\u000d\u000a      interesting conclusions. It enabled the analysis to go beyond traditional\u000d\u000a      concepts within the\u000d\u000a      literature, such as 'colonisation', 'transplantation', 'new branches',\u000d\u000a      'outlets' and 'settlements'. This\u000d\u000a      new approach allows for a more precise analysis that explains why some\u000d\u000a      countries and not others\u000d\u000a      were chosen as hosts, as well as why criminals move abroad and the nature\u000d\u000a      of their accomplices.\u000d\u000a      In particular, the concept of 'functional mobility' was developed to\u000d\u000a      explain how organised crime\u000d\u000a      groups move abroad while remaining in contact with their local territory.\u000d\u000a      In other words, to truly\u000d\u000a      understand the movement of organised crime groups, it is important to\u000d\u000a      focus both on the local\u000d\u000a      context and on global markets. This approach highlights the necessity for\u000d\u000a      European law\u000d\u000a      enforcement agencies to understand Italian organised crime groups in both\u000d\u000a      their local and global\u000d\u000a      context as well as the need for better European wider cooperation to\u000d\u000a      combat them.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43258","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Diamond has collaborated with a range of beneficiaries who have drawn on\u000a      her research as a way of engaging the public's interest in the period\u000a      allowing Diamond to impact on English speaking audiences globally, across\u000a      Europe, the US and Australasia through a variety of mediums. In June 2013,\u000a      Fleeing Hitler had sold close to 10,000 copies, mostly overseas,\u000a      largely in the US (6080). These figures demonstrate the significance of\u000a      her book which was well received and widely reviewed in the broadsheet\u000a      press including The New York Review of Books, The Times Higher\u000a        Educational Supplement, The FT Magazine (Culture), The Sunday Times\u000a        (Culture), Tribune, The Historian. In the London Review of Books\u000a      in May 2008, Jeremy Harding described the book as `a convincing piece of\u000a      history drawing on contemporary accounts'. It was translated into Japanese\u000a      in 2009 with a print run of 2,000 copies. Diamond's books have been widely\u000a      adopted on University courses relating to French\/ European history and\u000a      Gender history across the UK and the US (including at Yale, Amherst and\u000a      McMater, Canada).\u000a    Contribution to the creative sector\u000a    1. In the media\u000a    As detailed below, the wide dissemination of Diamond's publications have\u000a      led her to be regularly approached by radio and TV producers who engage\u000a      her to shape the delivery of her research for their programmes. She has\u000a      been able to change their assumptions and shape their outputs thereby\u000a      refining existing narratives about the period. In particular, she has\u000a      showcased women's voices and experience. Her work has informed the ways\u000a      that the public understand and remember the everyday of the Second World\u000a      War.\u000a    Radio producers\u000a    Diamond made an expert contribution to a BBC World Service's `The Why\u000a      Factor' in October 2012 on `The Shaved Head'. She was interviewed about\u000a      her research on the women whose heads were shaved in `punishment' for\u000a      sleeping with the enemy after the Liberation of France. `Dr Diamond\u000a        played an important role ... She provided invaluable background\u000a        and helped contextualise the story and issues raised in a powerful and\u000a        moving way. ... Dr Diamond sent us some very useful research material,\u000a        including her own very accessible book on this period, which helped to\u000a        pull together a major section of the programme. We were extremely\u000a        grateful for Dr Diamond's input and look forward to working together\u000a        again in the future. ... the World Service has a weekly audience of 180\u000a        million globally'.

In April 2011 she\u000a      prepared material for an episode with JK Rowling and provided context for\u000a      her relative's wartime letters. `Her expertise on the daily life of\u000a        French civilians during the Second World War helped Jo Rowling to\u000a        understand what her great grandfather experienced while he was trapped\u000a        in the suburbs of Paris' (consolidated viewing figures 7 million &#8212;\u000a      filmed interview not included). (2) She researched a further episode on\u000a      Patrick Stewart whose father experienced post traumatic stress as a result\u000a      of his experiences in France in May 1940. Diamond's research and the\u000a      additional documentation she uncovered enabled them to better communicate\u000a      the suffering of civilians caught up in events. (3.5 million viewers,\u000a      Diamond credited in the end titles).\u000a    In October 2012 she contributed to a New Zealand based production\u000a      company's film on NZ born SOE agent Nancy Wake. `Her on camera\u000a        interview ... informed us as producers, as it will our audiences, to\u000a        help comprehend the risks that Nancy as a woman agent ran in Occupied\u000a        France. [It] has played an important role in helping our\u000a        audiences to understand the context of the world in which the resistance\u000a        operated and thereby gave us further insights into the aspect of Nancy\u000a        Wake's own experience that should be communicated to audiences.\u000a        Diamond's research ... will really help to inform the public\u000a        understanding of hidden aspects to these significant events' (3).\u000a      The film has been delivered to New Zealand's TV One. Distributors expect\u000a      to sell the programme into Europe, the UK and Australia.\u000a    Diamond also advised Maryland based Gardner Productions about the\u000a      civilian experience in Paris1939-43 for their film on woman SOE agent\u000a      Noor-un-nisa Inayat Khan. `Diamond's\u000a        contribution has played an important role in informing this documentary\u000a        project both for us as producers in helping us to shape the material\u000a        that will be communicated to audiences and more directly as a result of\u000a        her on-screen interview' (4). The programme will be screened on PBS\u000a      in the US in the autumn and is expected to be sold to Channel 4 and other\u000a      European channels. Working with media professionals has enabled Diamond to\u000a      reach global audiences and to bring changes in understandings of this\u000a      period across the English speaking world.\u000a    2. In the curatorial sector\u000a    Fleeing Hitler was used as the basis for 4 of 22 panels (18%) of\u000a      an exhibition in Germany on the German invasion of France entitled \"Das\u000a      &#252;berschreitet die Grenzen der Vernunft &#8212; Mythos Blitzkrieg\" which ran at\u000a      the German Tank Museum, Munster, Lower Saxony, from August 10 - November\u000a      30 2010. During this period, roughly 40.000 people physically walked\u000a      through the hall in which the exhibition was shown. The exhibition was\u000a      then lent to the \"Wehrgeschichtliches Museum Rastatt\" in the south of\u000a      Germany from April 24 - August 15 2011 where a further 5.000 - 10.000\u000a      visitors saw the exhibition. The curator of the exhibition wrote: \"...\u000a        it's safe to say that the exhibition was at least in some cases able to\u000a        change viewpoints fundamentally, based on a deeper understanding of the\u000a        human side of this historical event. \"The French\" of 1940 in the mind of\u000a        these visitors were no longer only the soldiers &#8212; now these visitors\u000a        thought also of the civilians and what they had to endure \"(5).\u000a    3. Non-academic editors and publishers\u000a    Diamond has written reviews and a column for the THES (2-8\u000a      September 2010) in their section entitled `The Canon' on Lucie Aubrac's, `Ils\u000a        partiront dans l'ivresse' (1984). Following an invitation she wrote\u000a      a preface to Fernande Davis, 2008, `Girl in the Belgian Resistance: A\u000a        Wakeful Eye in the Underground', Beach Lloyd Publishers, 2nd\u000a      Edition. In one telling example, Charlotte Heatherley recounted her\u000a      elderly friend's reactions to reading Diamond's book: ` As I read\u000a        excerpts aloud to Josette, I witnessed a transformation ... Finally,\u000a        here was validation and corroboration of all she had told her family\u000a        through the years. Hearing these stories gave her a kind of peace.\u000a        Sharing her memories, getting them permanently recorded, became\u000a        Josette's focus during the last month of her life. She said that it had\u000a        made the dying process easier'. They were published as a book\u000a      entitled `Saga of a French Dish' (2010) (6).\u000a    Contributing to wider public understanding of the Second World War\u000a          in France\u000a    The public have been exposed to Diamond's work through her interactions\u000a      with the creative sector as described above and she has also been involved\u000a      in further public engagement activities which have given her the\u000a      opportunity to engage directly with interested parties.\u000a    1. Via community engagement\u000a    Diamond's was invited to participate in the events around the 70th\u000a      anniversary of De Gaulle's Appel in 1940, and on 17 June 2010 she spoke at\u000a      a day conference on `Charles de Gaulle, London and the Resistance' held at\u000a      the Institut Fran&#231;ais on women in the French resistance. She\u000a      broadcast two live radio interviews on the morning news (BBC Bristol and\u000a      BBC Wales) about her VIP invitation to attend the commemorative ceremony\u000a      held at the Chelsea Barracks involving both the French President Sarkozy\u000a      and the British Prime Minister Cameron.\u000a    2. Via the web\u000a    Diamond's interview on the death of Resistance hero Raymond Aubrac in\u000a      April 2012 published by the CNN website provoked considerable discussion\u000a      about the nature and extent of the French Resistance and the contribution\u000a      it made to the Second World War. http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2012\/04\/11\/world\/raymond-aubrac-obit\u000a      It received 250 posted comments and 613 recommendations on facebook.\u000a      Diamond is a strong believer in the power of the internet as a tool for\u000a      public engagement. Her work continues to be the subject of web discussions\u000a      on sites like goodreads.com, Coolread4.html, wordpress.com and http:\/\/thathideousman\u000a      testifying to its reach. On 3\/12\/2010 one blogger wrote of `Fleeing\u000a        Hitler': `we can read this kind of book as a background when we\u000a        try to understand what is happening in our times. ... The kinds of\u000a        thoughts that were in the minds of Parisians in 1940 should to some\u000a        extent correspond to the thoughts in the heads of people fleeing from\u000a        Srebrenica'.\u000a\u0009https:\/\/whenthenightcomesfallingfromthesky.wordpress.com\/2010\/12\/03\/book-fleeing-hitler-france-1940-why-people-run-away-in-war\/\u000a    The continuous flow of correspondence from readers of her work in the UK\u000a      and the US offering her accounts of their and their family's war-time\u000a      experiences inspired Diamond to secure funding to put together an\u000a      interactive website to enable people to post their family stories and\u000a      share their experiences with one another and other interested users. (See\u000a      www.fleeinghitler.org). This\u000a      provides valuable evidence of the level of public engagement and the\u000a      transformative influence her work has had on readers. The website is\u000a      currently populated with 44 stories and blogs from a total of 26\u000a      contributors. Comments made both by contributors and users visiting the\u000a      website indicate that Diamond's work provides families with a form of\u000a      authentication of their stories and has thereby had a significant impact\u000a      in helping them to come to terms with that past. One user commented `A\u000a        wonderful opportunity for people to have a voice with their stories,\u000a        which otherwise might have disappeared unheard'. Contributors have\u000a      embraced the opportunity to share their family stories with other\u000a      interested parties.\u000a    Ivor Samuels wrote `When we told my aunt about Hanna Diamond's website\u000a        project, it inspired her to recount her story after previously refusing\u000a        to put anything down or give an account which was more than disconnected\u000a        anecdotes. We all felt that the website offered her an appropriate way\u000a        to present her memories and could offer those interested in the period\u000a        and the events a valuable resource' (7). A psychotherapist commented\u000a      on the website that this sharing was important `to help them to face up\u000a        to and work through the intergenerational impact of family members\u000a        either surviving or indeed perishing in the Holocaust'. The website\u000a      launch was attended by 150 people and generated local media attention.\u000a      Since its launch in January 2013, the website has attracted 32 comments\u000a      and over 1400 visitors throughout the world. It is notable that users\u000a      spend close to four minutes on the site, viewing an average of at least\u000a      four pages per visit which is a remarkably high figure. The site is\u000a      valuable depository for testimony to be preserved digitally; an example of\u000a      how digital technology can be used to create a living historical resource\u000a      which is a widely available, growing digital archive.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Diamond's research has enhanced public understanding of the lives of\u000a      French civilians during World War 2.

It falls into two themes; both\u000a      associated with a significant monograph. The first deals with issues of\u000a      Gender, and the second with the French experience of defeat in 1940.\u000a    Diamond's research on Gender and the Second World War in France\u000a      (A) uncovered the different ways in which French men and women experienced\u000a      the war. The book was the first to chart the pressures faced by women and\u000a      their experience of the transition into the post-war period. It\u000a      demonstrates that women's age and family situations had an important\u000a      bearing on their daily life choices and their chances of survival. Her\u000a      work illuminated our understanding of how women could be drawn into\u000a      resistance or collaboration through their everyday lives. It argues that\u000a      the Occupation explicitly brought politics into the private sphere in a\u000a      way which provided an opportunity for women to act `politically'; for\u000a      example by inviting a German officer into their home or hiding a Jewish\u000a      family in their attic. However despite gaining the right to vote in 1944,\u000a      most women struggled to carry through this political commitment into their\u000a      post-war lives and the immediate post-war period saw most women withdraw\u000a      from the public sphere and focus on rebuilding their home lives with the\u000a      return of the men.\u000a    Her second area of research on France's experience of defeat\u000a      (B) was the first exploration in English of how it felt for French people\u000a      to become refugees in their own country. It explores the reasons why\u000a      people left their homes to risk all on the roads of France. It argues that\u000a      lack of preparation for possible invasion and the ensuing exodus of\u000a      civilians laid the path for P&#233;tain's Vichy government to take power in a\u000a      climate of trauma and amidst the complete collapse of the structures of\u000a      the Third Republic. It explores the reasons why this important event in\u000a      the history of France has been completely overlooked in the historical\u000a      record and Diamond's research has had an important impact in drawing\u000a      attention to these events.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43259","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has contributed to processes of commemoration,\u000a      memorialisation and reconciliation, in terms of:\u000a    (1) Public discourse, where the public has gained an understanding of the\u000a      issues and challenges faced by Italian society, including the existence of\u000a      partisan reconstructions of the past, divided memories and the plight of\u000a      victims of terrorism, who feel that truth and justice have not been\u000a      secured.

On the strength of its excellent reviews and\u000a      citations, as well as adoption in university courses, the research\u000a      attracted the attention of the Media, leading to:\u000a    (a) a commissioned paper in 2009 by il Mulino (a non-academic journal\u000a      with a circulation of 8,000 and a website with c. 15,000 hits per month)\u000a      to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Milan 1969 bombing massacre and\u000a      comment on the disappointing trial verdicts for this massacre as well as\u000a      on the legacy of extreme-right terrorism.\u000a    (b) A further paper was commissioned in 2010 by il Mulino commenting on\u000a      the disappointing trial verdict in 2010 for the 1974 Brescia massacre. As\u000a      the Editor stated: `The author is not only one of the top experts in the\u000a      field; she is also always prepared to write on these themes for an\u000a      educated yet not specialist public, as the one addressed by the journal il\u000a      Mulino'.1\u000a    The 2009 article was extensively summarised in the authoritative daily\u000a      IlSole24ore on 13 December 2009 and in the blog by Nicola Rao, author of\u000a      bestsellers on the extreme-right, starting a debate among right activists\u000a      concerning neofascism's role in terrorism, an issue they generally\u000a      consider as taboo. 2 Other Italian blogs and the online Wikipedia cited\u000a      the research (10 blogs and 12 wikipedia entries) as well as quality media,\u000a      including British and Italian established newspapers. Radio interviews\u000a      with Australian, Belgian and Italian national radio programmes, including\u000a      a live recording of a 3-hour programme by RAI Radio 3 commemorating the\u000a      1980 massacre on 2 August 2010. The Producer states, `Farenheit is one of\u000a      the most important cultural broadcasts from RAI. We estimate that an\u000a      audience of at least 200,000 listen to our programme. In particular, the\u000a      programme broadcast on 2 August 2010 attracted a wide audience given that\u000a      it focused on a dramatic event which is still present in the civil\u000a      conscience of the city of Bologna and Italy as a whole. Your participation\u000a      in the debate and the programme was especially valued and appreciated'.3\u000a    (c) Keynote speech (to c. 500 people) at a 2012 public seminar on\u000a      Conflicts in Memory, to `create dialogue between Aarhus University and the\u000a      surrounding society concerning subjects of wider societal interest' (http:\/\/matchpoints.au.dk\/aboutmatchpoints\/).\u000a      Bull gave an interview to daily Kristeligt-Dagblad on the legacy\/memory of\u000a      conflict in Europe, and to italiensklrerforeningen on the legacy\/ and\u000a      memory of terrorism in Italy.4\u000a    Thanks to this wider dissemination, research was able to enhance public\u000a      understanding of the continuing relevance and lack of closure concerning\u000a      the political violence that raged in Italy in the 1960s-1980s and to\u000a      contribute to processes of commemoration and memorialisation.\u000a    (2) Civil society, where it has helped Victims' Associations commemorate\u000a      the violent past, highlight their exclusion from the reconciliation\u000a      process, engage in a dialogue with former terrorists and share experiences\u000a      with other Victims' Associations. This has been achieved through\u000a      involvement with their events and the media and facilitating their\u000a      interaction with each other and with former terrorists.\u000a    Bull's research collaboration with various victims and their relatives,\u000a      and the media attention on her advocating the need for a wider process of\u000a      truth and reconciliation in Italy, attracted the attention of Associations\u000a      of Victims of Terrorism. Italian Victims' Associations have formed in the\u000a      early 1980s and are still in existence, comprising roughly 2,000 members.\u000a      They have been able to:\u000a    (a) raise public awareness of terrorism and its legacy\u000a    (b) educate school children who would not have experience of the events\u000a    (c) begin a process of reconciliation with former terrorists\u000a    l(d) earn from other Victims' Associations\u000a    Collaboration has been especially intense and ongoing with the\u000a      Brescia-based Casa della Memoria (formerly the Association of the Victims\u000a      of the 1974 Brescia Massacre). The Association has benefitted from:\u000a    Bull's major speech to an audience of c.2000 local teachers and\u000a      schoolchildren in May 2010, commemorating the 1974 massacre, widely\u000a      reported in the local media.\u000a    Her involvement in an informed public debate with c. 100 local\u000a      citizens\/students in 2011, also commemorating the 1974 massacre, widely\u000a      reported in the local media.\u000a    These speeches appeared in a commemorative volume distributed to c. 250\u000a      local\/regional schools and libraries. Feedback indicates that they gave\u000a      rise to in-class discussions in schools on terrorism and its legacy,\u000a      thereby partially compensating for the lack of inclusion of these issues\u000a      in the school curriculum.\u000a    Her involvement in a heated public debate in 2010, before c. 200 local\u000a      citizens, following a live interview broadcast by the local TV station.\u000a      Many commented on the need for more such occasions to remember the past\u000a      and discuss its legacy.\u000a    Other victims' associations from Italy, Spain and the UK have been\u000a      interested in the research. Bull has brought them together in a knowledge\u000a      transfer workshop, held in Bath in June 2012.\u000a    Participants included: from Italy, Mr. Milani, President, Casa della\u000a      Memoria; Mr. Guglielminetti, Head of International Relations, Associazione\u000a      italiana vittime del terrorismo (Aiviter); from Spain, Mr. Silva,\u000a      President, Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory; from the UK,\u000a      Ms. Dover, Programme Manager, Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation for\u000a      Peace; Mr. Gallagher, President, Omagh Support Group. This enabled the\u000a      associations to meet and compare aims and activities, as well as\u000a      approaches to and practices of reconciliation thereby extending the reach\u000a      of Bull's impact beyond Italy.\u000a    Jo Dover wrote that `The workshop provided an opportunity to widen our\u000a      existing contacts, especially in view of the importance our organisation\u000a      attributes to cross-national links [...] We would welcome further\u000a      collaboration with Italian and Spanish victims' associations to promote\u000a      these processes [of dialogue and reconciliation] on a wider scale'.5\u000a      Manlio Milani stated that the workshop had stimulated his association to\u000a      establish contacts at the European level and to develop a similar\u000a      comparative approach in Italy. Guglieminetti wrote of his gratitude for\u000a      Bull's work, stating that `It is for us very important that academic work,\u000a      after decades of absence, focuses its attention on the activities of the\u000a      victims of terrorism and their associations. This is a very useful\u000a      acknowledgment for promoting a debate between theory and practice, history\u000a      and memory, academic research and the didactic activity carried out by\u000a      victims among schoolchildren. Furthermore, I am convinced that\u000a      associations like mine need their work to be analysed and verified by\u000a      academic researchers working on terrorism at the European level.'6\u000a      Collaboration with these associations is ongoing. Indeed Bull was invited\u000a      to join the Radicalisation Awareness Network's working group Voices of\u000a      Victims of Terrorism (VVT). RAN is set up by the European Commission as an\u000a      EU-wide umbrella network of practitioners and local actors involved in\u000a      countering violent radicalisation.\u000a    Recent research has also discussed the ways in which the narratives and\u000a      memories of both former terrorists and victims can foster a dialogue and\u000a      has identified a group of former terrorists who are open to a dialogue\u000a      with victims. This has enabled Casa della Memoria to facilitate a\u000a      pioneering and confidential on-going dialogue among a small group of\u000a      victims and former terrorists, to encourage reconciliation. `Your ideas\u000a      and reflections have spurred a debate with other associations (especially\u000a      those in Bologna and Milan) but above all they constitute an important\u000a      reference point for a project that sees former terrorists (from the Red\u000a      Brigades and Prima Linea especially) work together with relatives of\u000a      victims (like Agnese Moro). This frank exchange of views will soon be in\u000a      the public domain with the aim of drawing attention to the theme of public\u000a      memory, which must include the participation of both victims and\u000a      perpetrators. The document we are discussing also aims to show that it is\u000a      possible to embark on a path of social reconciliation especially when it\u000a      is a matter of crimes involving (and perpetrated against) society as a\u000a      whole and not just individual victims. When a joint document will be\u000a      produced and the public initiative will take place, you will be able to\u000a      see, I am pleased to say, that they will both have been informed by the\u000a      themes and issues you put forward in your research'.7\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bull's research on the legacy of Italian terrorism has enhanced public\u000a      understanding of the lack of closure around the political violence that\u000a      convulsed the country in the 1960s to1980s and in doing so has contributed\u000a      to processes of commemoration, memorialisation and reconciliation. It has\u000a      benefited communities of interest in civil society, primarily Associations\u000a      of Victims, school children, and the wider public.

It has been carried out at the\u000a      University of Bath since 2004, supported by the AHRC through a period of\u000a      Research Leave in 2005 and a Fellowship in 2010. Prior to 2008, findings\u000a      appeared primarily in the form of a solo-authored book, published in 2007,\u000a      which was extensively and very favourably reviewed. This was followed by\u000a      other publications and new research, underpinned by a high number of\u000a      exclusive interviews with ex-terrorists and victims, leading to a new book\u000a      in 2013. Findings were also disseminated in Italian, and it is in this\u000a      country that they generated the greatest impact. Terrorism can be best\u000a      conceived as a tool and terrorists as users of this tool, albeit with\u000a      diverse aims. In Italy terrorist means were used by extreme-right and\u000a      extreme left groups, both of which were manipulated by state actors.\u000a    The research initially focused on extreme-right terrorism, carried out\u000a      between 1969 and 1980. This form of terrorism has been little examined by\u000a      academics and is little known by the general public, not least because of\u000a      its ambiguous and complex nature, yet it has left a deep legacy. The\u000a      research examined this legacy, exploring issues related to reconciliation,\u000a      memory, truth and justice, and comparing the views of victims,\u000a      perpetrators and right-wing politicians in the face of recent judicial\u000a      verdicts, that were reached in 2004, 2005 and 2010. These verdicts largely\u000a      failed to identify the individual culprits and resulted in acquittals,\u000a      albeit with a dubious formula (`insufficient evidence'). However, they\u000a      also established the involvement of neofascist groups and the connivance\u000a      of sectors of the state.\u000a    One major research finding was the reluctance of the post-fascist party\u000a      to come to terms with the involvement of Italian neofascism in the bombing\u000a      massacres. The Italian state, in turn, has opted for a strategy of\u000a      `amnesia'. In the absence of an officially recognised truth regarding the\u000a      bombing massacres, different political groups construct their own partisan\u000a      version of `the truth', depicting past perpetrators of political violence\u000a      in heroic terms and\/or as victims unjustly persecuted by the state. This\u000a      situation, defined as a `politics of non-reconciliation', has left a heavy\u000a      legacy for Italian democracy.\u000a    Recent research focused on the legacy of both left and right terrorism\u000a      and established that the victims &#8212; civilians killed in bombing attacks as\u000a      well as magistrates, journalists, civil servants targeted by armed\u000a      `combatants' &#8212; had been left out entirely from state measures aimed at\u000a      overcoming political violence and achieving reconciliation. In this\u000a      context, the associations representing the victims feel left alone in\u000a      their struggle for memory, truth and justice. Research examined the role\u000a      played by victims and victims' associations in making their voices heard\u000a      and argued for the need of a wider process of reconciliation,\u000a      commemoration and truth telling.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43433","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Abdel Haleem's translations have sold more than a quarter of a million\u000d\u000a      copies internationally and\u000d\u000a      many pirated versions of the 2010 edition are available for download from\u000d\u000a      websites in Pakistan and\u000d\u000a      elsewhere; in February 2013 it was available on the notorious, `Pirate's\u000d\u000a      Bay' website, now blocked\u000d\u000a      by leading search engines.

The book is widely available in UK mosques; for example,\u000d\u000a      Palmers Green Mosque\u000d\u000a      makes bulk orders of the book to sell at a reduced price to its community.\u000d\u000a      (1) The Building Bridges\u000d\u000a      Seminars on Muslim-Christian relations, convened by the Archbishop of\u000d\u000a      Canterbury, use only\u000d\u000a      Abdel Haleem's translation in its literature and annual omnibus featuring\u000d\u000a      content of the seminars,\u000d\u000a      whose multi-faith readership is considerable.

For\u000d\u000a      this professor in Iran to accept and use a translation by a Sunni scholar\u000d\u000a      is a telling example of how\u000d\u000a      widely this translation is accepted.\u000d\u000a    A professor at the university of Waterloo in Canada has written to Abdel\u000d\u000a      Haleem:\u000d\u000a    I would like to express my gratitude for your English translation of\u000d\u000a        the Quran. Of all the translations\u000d\u000a        I have read, I find yours clear, succinct and easy to understand. I have\u000d\u000a        used it in my classes and I\u000d\u000a        always encourage non-Muslims to read the introduction you have provided,\u000d\u000a        clarifying so many\u000d\u000a        misconceptions.

(4)\u000d\u000a    Further impact through dissemination of the translation and its\u000d\u000a      underpinning research is evident in\u000d\u000a      Abdel Haleem's participation in a range of literary festivals, public\u000d\u000a      debates and inter-faith meetings.\u000d\u000a      He spoke at the Emirates Airline Dubai Literary Festival (March 2011) on\u000d\u000a      the subject of translating\u000d\u000a      the Qur'an, and participated in the Times Cheltenham Literary\u000d\u000a      Festival (October 2010), where the\u000d\u000a      book stock sold out in the first two hours, to an audience of several\u000d\u000a      hundred.

In his\u000a      book Pariah Politics (2009) [see Section 3, R1] and the article\u000a      `Boomerang and Slingshots' (2008) [R2] he investigated conceptual issues\u000a      that shape the empirical measurement of social cohesion. In particular\u000a      this earlier work highlighted the need to focus on active versus passive\u000a      standards of evidence, the interplay between individual perceptions and\u000a      objective measures of integration, and the extent to which feelings of\u000a      common purpose transcend differences of ethnic background.\u000a    As a result of the conceptual approaches developed in this research,\u000a      Saggar was asked to carry out a study for the Migration Advisory Committee\u000a      investigating the impacts of social cohesion and integration. To do this\u000a      Saggar assembled a research team consisting of:\u000a    Dr Rob Ford (Manchester); Dr Maria Sobolewska (Oxford); and Will\u000a      Somerville (Migration Policy Institute).\u000a    The commissioned research comprised three interlocking parts, each of\u000a      which constituted specific deliverables for MAC:\u000a    \u000a      A review of theoretical, conceptual, empirical and comparative\u000a        investigations of the `Impact of Migration on Social Cohesion and\u000a        Integration'.\u000a      A study of methodological and practical challenges in `Measuring the\u000a        Impact of Migration on Integration and Social Cohesion'.\u000a      A final report (drawing on the former two outputs) containing a)\u000a        specific strategy for measuring the myriad relationships between\u000a        immigration, and b) a selected basket of social impacts, alongside an\u000a        empirical case study focused on two particular aspects of cohesion and\u000a        integration.\u000a    \u000a    The final report [R4] was able to build a coherent strategy for empirical\u000a      examination of social impacts that was then deployed via a detailed case\u000a      study. In doing so, the combined effect of the research was to create a\u000a      framework for measurement and thus inform a broader framework for\u000a      evidence-based public policy being shaped by MAC. This aspect of the\u000a      underlying research is central to assessment of its impacts as described\u000a      in Section 4 below.\u000a    Furthermore, the five main empirical findings of the research made an\u000a      original contribution to knowledge and to informed policy understanding:\u000a    \u000a      There are powerful distinctions in conceptualising and empirically\u000a        measuring national identity effects as against integration\/group outcome\u000a        effects as against social cohesion effects. For example, they may\u000a        interact: cohesion perceptions may be nuanced by how immigrant groups\u000a        perform (on integration) or by worries among citizens from the white\u000a        majority over national identity.\u000a      The choice of measure is critical &#8212; for example whether we assess\u000a        employment outcomes or the rates of intermarriage &#8212; and different\u000a        immigrant groups perform differently depending on the measure.\u000a      On national identity, the trend over time is away from an ancestral\u000a        understanding of Britishness to one based more on civic values. There is\u000a        little evidence that immigration has played a role in this.\u000a      On cohesion, the analysis indicates that deprivation&#8212;not\u000a        migration&#8212;best explains peoples' perceptions of their local area.\u000a        However, existing diversity may partly explain differences in levels of\u000a        cohesion.\u000a      The findings are qualified by shortcomings in the data, not least the\u000a        inability to drill down to ward level as a more suitable proxy for\u000a        neighbourhood than local authority level.\u000a    \u000a    The above are derived in part from previous academic research as well as\u000a      used in the MAC published research output (see Section 3 below).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44002","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"933860","Name":"Botswana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1655842","Name":"Laos"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2464461","Name":"Tunisia"},{"GeoNamesId":"617790","Name":"Moldova"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    International economic integration is increasingly important and\u000a      TradeSift illuminates economic\u000a      effects and policy implications robustly and cheaply. It is also an\u000a      effective tool for capacity-building\u000a      on trade policy and more than 400 policy makers from over 70 countries\u000a      have been trained since\u000a      2000. The interactive nature of the programmes allows officials from\u000a      different countries to analyse\u000a      sensitive bilateral trade policy issues in an informal non-negotiating\u000a      context with open agendas.\u000a    How the research underpins the impact:\u000a    TradeSift was developed from having undertaken complex computer modelling\u000a      and in recognition\u000a      of the high financial and human cost to policy makers of such modelling\u000a      for the analysis of trade\u000a      performance, to help understand policy options, and to engage in trade\u000a      negotiations. This is\u000a      particularly the case for developing countries.

The\u000a      direct impact of this\u000a      process has been to provide a tool for policy-makers and government\u000a      ministries, and to build\u000a      capacity for trade policy decision-making and negotiation. The feedback\u000a      from participants has been\u000a      invariably positive [see Section 5, C1]:\u000a    `... my Director is particularly pleased that I was able to use it\u000a        [TradeSift] to analyse trade data\u000a        and draw inferences on the implications of the GSTP and D8 preferential\u000a        trade agreements for\u000a        Nigeria' (Trade Official, Nigeria)\u000a    `Our WTO mission is already examining the possibility of incorporating\u000a        this scheme of data\u000a        analyses into our regular training courses for the Trade Officers prior\u000a        to their departure to\u000a        respective serving stations abroad' (Commercial Counsellor, WTO,\u000a        Pakistan)\u000a    `Thanks for the superb training, support and making economic modelling\u000a        appealing to a lawyer.\u000a        I shared my lessons with the Economic Diplomacy team here and as a first\u000a        step we've agreed\u000a        to test the software on an Aid for Trade job that we're involved in'\u000a        (South African Institute of\u000a        International Affairs)\u000a    `Without doubt, the knowledge and experience gained during the 5-day\u000a        course will be shared\u000a        with my colleagues in my home country.

In\u000a        those countries with\u000a        some trade economics capability TradeSift has dramatically improved the\u000a        situation.

[C3]\u000a    `TradeSift was used regularly for manipulating and analysing large\u000a        trade and tariff datasets.\u000a        This information was combined with information from stakeholders to\u000a        identify UK and ultimately\u000a        EU priorities in current and future trade negotiations.' [C4]\u000a    `TradeSift analytic outputs played a key role in forming European\u000a        Commission and UK\u000a        negotiating positions on the future of the GSP, the EU's principal trade\u000a        preference scheme [for\u000a      developing countries] in advance of the negotiations.' [C5]\u000a    An initial contract in 2012 for training and capacity-building for the\u000a      Ministry of Commerce, India has\u000a      led to a 3-year joint programme of training and research for Indian and\u000a      Pakistani trade officials.\u000a      Even during the current political tensions, officials from both countries\u000a      have jointly participated in\u000a      TradeSift training in Delhi and Kathmandu and a workshop in Islamabad is\u000a      being planned. The joint\u000a      workshop in Delhi was the first time Pakistani officials had visited the\u000a      Indian Institute of Foreign\u000a      Trade:\u000a    `TradeSift, indeed, can play a significant role in meaningful analysis\u000a        of India-Pakistan trade\u000a        flows and potential. My reports will be very useful for policy decisions\u000a        on Pakistan-India trade\u000a        relations.' (Trade Minister, Pakistan High Commission, New Delhi)\u000a    The department works closely with both the Indian and Pakistan Commerce\u000a      ministries and\u000a      increasingly with External Affairs in Delhi and believes it is one of the\u000a      few projects facilitating\u000a      contact between personnel of the two states and the UK [C7, C8, C9].\u000a    Under the Trade Advocacy Fund programme in 2013 Tradesift also provided\u000a      training and on-going\u000a      support to the East African Community (EAC): `The course is proving to\u000a        be very useful in assisting\u000a        the EAC in preparing negotiating positions on market integration' [C6].\u000a      They expect to be\u000a      delivering courses in Zambia and Laos, shortly, as part of this funding\u000a      framework.\u000a    In 2011-2013 three courses were provided for over 40 participants from\u000a      nine countries for the\u000a      Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which\u000a      wishes to\u000a      enhance the capacity of its staff and members, several of whom have\u000a      requested proposals for\u000a      further work.

The\u000a      on-going research also\u000a      led to the establishment of the Centre for the Analysis of Regional\u000a      Integration at Sussex (CARIS) in\u000a      2006.\u000a    TradeSift arose from the realisation that, for policy-makers,\u000a      sophisticated mathematical techniques\u000a      are frequently not appropriate or feasible; and that much can be gleaned\u000a      from the intelligent\u000a      consideration of data, and diagnostic indicators based on that\u000a      data (such as revealed comparative\u000a      advantage, intra-industry trade, etc.) [R3]. In 2004 DFID asked the Sussex\u000a      team to develop a\u000a      method for analysing regional trading agreements, which could be applied\u000a      without requiring\u000a      complicated modelling [R4]. The report provided a coherent analytical\u000a      method (the `Sussex\u000a      Framework') [R4] for analysing the issues through the use of descriptive\u000a      trade statistics and\u000a      indicators. The premise was that much can be learned from simple\u000a      quantification based on\u000a      analytical tabulation of data rather than formal modelling. We developed\u000a      `rules of thumb' which\u000a      could be applied by policy-makers. The value added was to use the\u000a      conclusions from the academic\u000a      research to put together a conceptual framework on which the rules of\u000a      thumb are based and which\u000a      comprises an integral part of the TradeSift software. The research was\u000a      conducted using both\u000a      formal modelling and the informal methods in order to find out how the\u000a      results of complex methods\u000a      can be replicated by simpler and more transparent approaches [R2]. These\u000a      conclusions fed\u000a      directly into the rules of thumb for a regional trading agreement, which\u000a      identify the data and\u000a      diagnostic indicators useful in determining whether a country is more or\u000a      less likely to gain. The key\u000a      innovation is thus methodological and lies in showing how key operational\u000a      conclusions can be\u000a      derived from trade data using a very few assumptions.\u000a    The researchers carried out extensive work on various aspects of `deep\u000a      integration' including legal\u000a      and political dimensions [R5]. They undertook a major study of the\u000a      qualitative impact of an EU-\u000a      India FTA, including the role of standards competition policy, and other\u000a      regulations, and the policy\u000a      implications (http:\/\/trade.ec.europa.eu\/doclib\/html\/135348.htm).\u000a      This is linked to work on the\u000a      industrial dimension of supply chains in international trade, which\u000a      emerged from work undertaken\u000a      by a then PhD student, and now collaborator (Lopez-Gonzalez). Researchers\u000a      are currently working\u000a      on an EU-funded project examining the barriers to such trade between the\u000a      EU and China and have\u000a      received approval for a joint project with policy researchers in India.\u000a    An essential feature of the approach is the recognition of the need to\u000a      take political and\u000a      distributional factors into account. The method does not, unlike\u000a      conventional economic analysis,\u000a      calculate a single net `welfare' effect but tries to highlight sectors\u000a      that will gain or lose from\u000a      integration processes, making it clear that it is for political\u000a      authorities to decide priorities.\u000a    The methods have also been applied to analyse the impact of EU trade\u000a      agreements (e.g. with India\u000a      or US) on excluded countries. Once again the approach is to show that\u000a      while aggregate or net\u000a      effects might be small, this obscures the fact that at the sectoral level\u000a      there may be both big\u000a      gainers and big losers, which cancel out at the aggregate level in most\u000a      formal models.\u000a    Numerous research projects have been undertaken, on the impact of trade\u000a      agreements, for the\u000a      European Commission, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the World Bank, and the\u000a      UK government\u000a      (both DFID and BIS) [R6, R3]. This includes the analysis of changes in\u000a      `rules of origin' in EU trade\u000a      agreements, analysis of the Economic Partnership Agreements between the EU\u000a      and developing\u000a      countries, the impact on excluded countries from an EU-India FTA, or the\u000a      recently announced\u000a      negotiations on an EU-US agreement (which will provide a basis for UK\u000a      input into the EU\u000a      negotiating position). Sussex produced an influential report on the\u000a      changes to the trade\u000a      preferences the EU offers developing countries, and research on the\u000a      international fragmentation of\u000a      supply chains.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44100","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research described in section 2 had impact by influencing the terms\u000d\u000a      of debate both in Greece and (through the `bail out' conditions) more\u000d\u000a      widely, and through direct influence on reforms of the Prime Minister's\u000d\u000a      Office and its links with the rest of government.\u000d\u000a    INFLUENCE ON THE TERMS OF DEBATE. Both the English and Greek\u000d\u000a      editions of [3] were reviewed in the mainstream Greek press (e.g. TO BHMA,\u000d\u000a      Kathimerini). Featherstone disseminated the book's central arguments &#8212;\u000d\u000a      weak processes of central control and coordination, inadequate monitoring\u000d\u000a      and evaluation as contributory factors in the failure of reform &#8212; in\u000d\u000a      newspaper articles [A], interviews [B] and presentations [C]. In addition,\u000d\u000a      the fieldwork interviews with surviving Prime Ministers and senior\u000d\u000a      officials described in section 2 themselves established a profile for the\u000d\u000a      research (and its central argument) among the political elite.\u000d\u000a    Because of these activities, when taking up office in October 2009, Prime\u000d\u000a      Minister (PM) George Papandreou, Finance Minister Papakonstantinou, and\u000d\u000a      their senior advisers, were already familiar with the research and\u000d\u000a      newspaper articles; and their advisers also read and commented on [4, 5].\u000d\u000a    Upon becoming Prime Minister, Papandreou invited Featherstone to join a\u000d\u000a      small informal group of his immediate advisers to review the organisation\u000d\u000a      of his office and its relations with the rest of government. In 2010, he\u000d\u000a      appointed Featherstone to join a new 5-member Committee charged with\u000d\u000a      bringing forward proposals for reform [D].\u000d\u000a    Expressly, the letter of invitation took up one of the key themes of\u000d\u000a      Featherstone's research, that reform should strengthen the processes of\u000d\u000a      control and coordination from the centre. The Committee reported in\u000d\u000a      mid-2010, outlining key principles and recommending structures.\u000d\u000a    Featherstone was the rapporteur for the Committee, responsible for\u000d\u000a      synthesising and editing the final report, which was later presented to\u000d\u000a      Parliament [D, E].\u000d\u000a    From Featherstone's discussions with the PM, and the subsequent work of\u000d\u000a      the Committee, it was evident that his core research findings had\u000d\u000a      influenced the PM and his colleagues, notably:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The sharp contrast between public views about the formal powers of\u000d\u000a        government and the reality of the constraints on processes of control\u000d\u000a        and coordination from the centre &#8212; constraints that have been evident\u000d\u000a        since 1974 despite attempts at reform.\u000d\u000a      The contrast between the resources allocated to the Prime Minister and\u000d\u000a        the centre of government in Greece and the substantially larger\u000d\u000a        resources available to governments of other European states of a similar\u000d\u000a        size.\u000d\u000a      Featherstone's arguments about the need to strengthen control,\u000d\u000a        monitoring and coordination within government &#8212; including policy\u000d\u000a        evaluation and impact assessment.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    IMPACT ON POLICY. By influencing the terms of the debate, the\u000d\u000a      research had a direct impact on government policy, and subsequently on\u000d\u000a      conditions imposed on Greece as part of the `bail out'.\u000d\u000a    Greek government policy: Featherstone's research was used as\u000d\u000a      evidence to inform Papandreou's organizational reforms as Prime Minister\u000d\u000a      [F], and news coverage [G] shows the public recognition of Featherstone's\u000d\u000a      influential role. In an address to his Cabinet in September 2010,\u000d\u000a      televised live, the PM quoted Featherstone's articles in support of the\u000d\u000a      reforms he was about to bring forward. Featherstone was the only member of\u000d\u000a      the Committee to be mentioned by name [F]. The Greek media also\u000d\u000a      highlighted Featherstone's influence [G]\u000d\u000a    The government announced organisational reforms consistent with the\u000d\u000a      Committee's report from November 2010 onwards. In January 2011, Parliament\u000d\u000a      voted on the creation of a General Secretariat to the Prime Minister with\u000d\u000a      new powers and responsibilities for coordination and control, follow-up\u000d\u000a      monitoring of the internal processes of the government, and policy\u000d\u000a      evaluation and impact assessment [F,H].\u000d\u000a    Policy as part of the `bail out': though the deepening economic\u000d\u000a      crisis meant that the Papandreou Government was unable to implement the\u000d\u000a      recommendations in full, or to complete the reforms to the PM's Office\u000d\u000a      [F], the reforms advanced by Featherstone and the Committee, were regarded\u000d\u000a      as crucial to the ability of a Greek government to meet the conditions of\u000d\u000a      its debt `bail-out' loans. The centrality of the reforms is evident in\u000d\u000a      several ways.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The OECD report on Greece in 2011 [I] criticised the lack of central\u000d\u000a        direction and coordination of the reform agenda and cited Featherstone\u000d\u000a        and Papadimitriou [3];\u000d\u000a      The Greek-IMF `Letter of Intent' [J] and subsequent follow-up reports\u000d\u000a        required organizational reform at the centre of government;\u000d\u000a      The invitation to Featherstone by the Head of the EU Commission\u000d\u000a        Taskforce for a private one-on-one briefing [K].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The impact of the research was sustained, as shown by the adoption of a\u000d\u000a      new law in January 2013 providing for the creation of a `General\u000d\u000a      Secretariat for the Coordination of the Government', with a Secretary\u000d\u000a      General to be appointed for a five-year term and a permanent staff [L].\u000d\u000a      This was consistent with Featherstone's emphasis on the need for\u000d\u000a      continuity of personnel and of structures, sustained by\u000d\u000a      politically-independent senior officials.\u000d\u000a    Greece's international partners have also recognised this agenda (Troika,\u000d\u000a      Taskforce, OECD) [I, J, K], emulating Featherstone's call in his 5 April\u000d\u000a      2009 Kathimerini article [A].

Dimitris Papadimitriou was a senior research fellow in the\u000d\u000a      LSE's Hellenic Observatory in 2002-3 and in 2010.\u000d\u000a    Research Insights and Outputs:\u000d\u000a    Featherstone's research has investigated the problems of `reform\u000d\u000a      capacity' in Greece, specifically the inability of governments to enact\u000d\u000a      reforms that they themselves have declared to be their objectives.\u000d\u000a    In early research [1], Featherstone contrasted the `modernisation'\u000d\u000a      initiatives with the cultural and structural constraints those initiatives\u000d\u000a      faced. A particular constraint identified by the research was the internal\u000d\u000a      weakness of the state administration &#8212; a large, ill-coordinated structure\u000d\u000a      beset by a suffocating legalism which, Featherstone argued, was itself a\u000d\u000a      reform priority.\u000d\u000a    Subsequent research with Papadimitriou deepened the focus on reform\u000d\u000a      capacity through case studies of failed reforms, an important example\u000d\u000a      being privatization [2]. The conclusion of this work [3] sets out a\u000d\u000a      `paradox of governance': despite its formal strength &#8212; and, in particular,\u000d\u000a      the Prime Minister's extensive constitutional powers &#8212; government in\u000d\u000a      Greece was inherently weak in the development, instigation, and\u000d\u000a      implementation of policy.\u000d\u000a    Featherstone and Papadimitriou went on to examine the extent to which the\u000d\u000a      internal structure and processes of government in Greece constrained\u000d\u000a      reform capacity. The research, which covered all governments since 1974,\u000d\u000a      evaluated successive attempts at organizational reform. Fieldwork for the\u000d\u000a      research in 2008-10, supported by the LSE's Hellenic Observatory, involved\u000d\u000a      over 35 personal interviews, including all surviving prime ministers, and\u000d\u000a      former ministers, senior advisers and officials. A central finding was\u000d\u000a      that, contrary to the mainstream assumptions in the Greek constitutional\u000d\u000a      literature, the Greek Prime Minister was an `emperor without clothes'.\u000d\u000a    Featherstone (with Papadimitriou) presented the research [4, subsequently\u000d\u000a      published as 5] at a conference on Greek reforms at Yale University in May\u000d\u000a      2009, expanding on the `paradox' noted in [3] and charting the course of\u000d\u000a      the weaknesses in Greek core executive since 1974.\u000d\u000a    The key findings of the body of research as a whole are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The limited resources (personnel, skills) available to the Greek Prime\u000d\u000a        Minister;\u000d\u000a      The limited operational power, in practice, of the Greek government at\u000d\u000a        the centre;\u000d\u000a      Ineffective administrative structures, including a lack of continuity\u000d\u000a        of (politically-independent) specialist personnel. As a result,\u000d\u000a        inadequate policy monitoring, evaluation, and learning undermined the\u000d\u000a        achievement of government objectives.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Featherstone therefore called explicitly for,\u000d\u000a    `a stronger government \"centre\" ...that will exert proper control over\u000d\u000a      all ministries and evaluate the results of their policies. Such a \"centre\"\u000d\u000a      would identify any problems in the government's operation and propose\u000d\u000a      solutions. The ministries would be made more transparent by an effective\u000d\u000a      monitoring system....[Also] there is a prime need for high-quality policy\u000d\u000a      advice...'

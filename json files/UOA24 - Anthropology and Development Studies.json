It is a UNFAO initiative supported by the Global Environmental\u000d\u000aFacility (GEF) (through UNDP during preparatory phases) and the full scale project is currently\u000d\u000abeing implemented\/executed by UNFAO, in close collaboration with United Nations Development\u000d\u000aProgramme (UNDP), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO),\u000d\u000aInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), The  International Plant Genetic Resources\u000d\u000aInstitute (IPGRI), United Nations University (UNU), bilateral donors, and others (a full list of\u000d\u000apartners is at http:\/\/www.fao.org\/giahs\/giahs-partners\/en\/; and see Terms of Reference for the\u000d\u000aGIAHS Steering Committee, detailed in section 5, point D).\u000d\u000aThe project document (UNFAO Implementation doc 2008-2013) is published on the FAO website:\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.fao.org\/fileadmin\/templates\/giahs\/PDF\/GIAHS_FSP_Document.pdf.\u000d\u000aA key consideration in the formulation of GIAHS was the extent of interlinkage and overlap with\u000d\u000aexisting international law and policy, and the agendas of other international institutions within the\u000d\u000aUN family. Expert advice was required to underpin the strategy of the then fledgling project in order\u000d\u000ato determine how it would develop and be implemented under a UN framework. A representative of\u000d\u000athe GIAHS team in UNFAO therefore approached Harrop after studying his publications.\u000d\u000aHarrop's report (August 2005) formed the basis of the policy approach establishing and supporting\u000d\u000athe GIAHS project. Previously the GIAHS team had been considering a potentially counter-productive `hard law' approach to GIAHS, which entails the development of new, global level,\u000d\u000aenforcement mechanisms (including systems of sanctions); instead, as a result of Harrop's advice,\u000d\u000athey pursued a policy that made use of existing legal frameworks. Harrop's report reviewed how\u000d\u000aexisting legal mechanisms, at the global, national and local levels, could be used to protect\u000d\u000aimportant agricultural heritage systems. Harrop reviewed the capacity for current policy instruments\u000d\u000aunder Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and Forest\u000d\u000aPrinciples to be used to protect agricultural systems. At the global level, Harrop identified existing\u000d\u000alegal support for such agricultural systems in the Convention on Biodiversity, World Heritage\u000d\u000aConvention, UNESCO Man and Biosphere Program, The RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands, The\u000d\u000aWorld Trade Organisation (WTO), and The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO),\u000d\u000aamongst others. The 2005 report also offers a summary of locally specific legal instruments\u000d\u000aincluding customary laws, legal arrangements surrounding community level land tenure systems,\u000d\u000aand legal instruments governing access to natural resources (especially for nomadic peoples) and\u000d\u000athe right to development.\u000d\u000aThe report was presented in Rome to senior members of UNFAO and representatives across\u000d\u000adivisions of that organisation, in addition to other representatives of international agencies and\u000d\u000ainstitutions of the UN including UNESCO, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the World\u000d\u000aIntellectual Property Organisation. It was also discussed and presented by Harrop at a number of\u000d\u000aother meetings in Rome with other key international organisations (section 5 points A, B).\u000d\u000aHarrop's critical advice was to develop these exiting legal instruments to develop protection for\u000d\u000aGIAHS; he states `Whereas a multilateral convention would be the ideal solution to securely\u000d\u000aestablish the GIAHS concept; it seems unlikely that this would be feasible having regard to the\u000d\u000atime it would take to negotiate and put in place. Further, there are some very sensitive areas of\u000d\u000aregulation to deal with such as trade and land tenure. Without a sensitive long-term strategy, these\u000d\u000atopics alone could frustrate the progress of an endeavour to achieve a complex regulatory\u000d\u000ainstrument. A policy document reiterating the objectives of the project and its connections with\u000d\u000aother ventures; adding in as many of the potential components of a convention as possible may be\u000d\u000aa more practical solution as a medium term goal ... In terms of the steps that should be taken it\u000d\u000awould be best to aim high but with sensitivity and caution. Whereas the ultimate goal might be a\u000d\u000aconvention or a sophisticated policy framework, the first step could be a simple supportive policy\u000d\u000adeclaration detailing the concept, reciting both its benefits and the manner in which GIAHS would\u000d\u000afulfil not only the FAO's objectives but also many of the other current key global aspirations. This\u000d\u000adeclaration could be made by the FAO itself although either COAG or CGRFA might constitute a\u000d\u000amore practical choice' (Harrop 2005).\u000d\u000aThe significance of the impact of Harrop's work is that the UNFAO approach to implementation\u000d\u000anow takes into account the complexity and difficulties associated with a hard law approach, as\u000d\u000aindicated in Harrop's report. Bearing in mind the extensive existing legal and policy framework\u000d\u000aindicated by Harrop, GIAHS is being implemented by UNFAO within current instruments, such as\u000d\u000athe Convention on Biological Diversity and resolutions of UN bodies at the Earth and World\u000d\u000aSummits. Its strategy is not to seek the establishment of a new hard law instrument but to deploy\u000d\u000aexisting obligations and act as a coordinating centre (with countries and with other institutions such\u000d\u000aas UNESCO, WIPO etc.), and as the International Institution responsible for certification of GIAHS\u000d\u000asites around the world (section 5, point B).\u000d\u000aHarrop's advice continues to be the foundational legal and policy basis of the functioning of GIAHS\u000d\u000aand continues to be displayed on the UNFAO site http:\/\/www.fao.org\/giahs\/giahs-inforesources\/publications\/publications-detail\/en\/c\/143375\/. Harrop also continues to advise the\u000d\u000aGIAHS secretariat through, inter alia, his membership of the GIAHS Scientific and Steering\u000d\u000aCommittee. The Terms of Reference of the Steering Committee state that `[t]he primary objective\u000d\u000aof the GIAHS Steering Committee is to discuss the policy and strategic orientation and activities of\u000d\u000athe GIAHS, and make suggestions to the GIAHS to help to improve the relevance and impact of its\u000d\u000awork' (details in section 5, point D).\u000d\u000aAs a member of the UNFAO GIAHS steering committee, Harrop has attended a number of\u000d\u000ameetings and at the most recent on 29-30 October 2012 in Rome he chaired the 3rd session\u000d\u000aentitled: Session 3 'GIAHS and links with CBD, ITPGRFA, UNESCO and other instruments'. The\u000d\u000ainternal minutes of this meeting corroborate further Harrop's impact in relation to the GIAHS\u000d\u000aproject: `Prof Harrop cautioned that aiming for a GIAHS convention would require much detailed\u000d\u000apreparatory work and the negotiation path towards it could be arduous, with compromise along the\u000d\u000away. Several other options would appear less complex and time-consuming, and some would lend\u000d\u000athemselves to a step-by-step or modular approach' (p.10); and `noting the excellent work of Prof\u000d\u000aHarrop on legal instruments and recently on the Aichi Targets, Mr Koohafkan enquired whether it\u000d\u000awould it be possible for him to prepare a concept note for a GIAHS instrument.' (pp.17-18); (details\u000d\u000ain section 5, point C).\u000d\u000aAt that meeting Dr Parviz Koohafkan, Director of the Land and Water division at UNFAO and global\u000d\u000acoordinator of the GIAHS project, described the 2005 report by Harrop as the fundamental basis\u000d\u000afor GIAHS policy and legal strategy, drawing on the links Harrop had identified to operate Joint\u000d\u000aVentures between UN Agencies. Dr Koohafkan reiterates the nature of Harrop's impact in a letter\u000d\u000adated 8 November 2012: `Words are not enough to express the impacts of your Legal Report, as a\u000d\u000acomprehensive model of legal assessment, inside the FAO, and within the international\u000d\u000acommunity' (statement detailed under section 5, point B). Thereafter, Harrop's report was re-appraised and one of his proposed strategies, that a protocol made under the express powers of\u000d\u000athe CBD, was recommended for further exploration as the next stage of the development of the\u000d\u000aGIAHS legal framework. A summary of the main points of the meeting are available at\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.fao.org\/fileadmin\/templates\/giahs_assets\/case_study_annexes\/6-CBD-Art-10c-_-8j-Aichi-Biodiversity-Targets-and-GIAHS-Mr-John-Scott.pdf.

Prior to\u000d\u000ajoining academia, Harrop qualified as a solicitor and worked as a legal advisor for a range of\u000d\u000aorganisations, including ICI and The London Stock Exchange, and he was Director of Legal\u000d\u000aServices for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA).\u000d\u000aHis research dealt with two key areas that concerned GIAHS:\u000d\u000aPaper 1 (section 3, publication i) examined the challenges facing some rural communities,\u000d\u000aregarding the protection of intellectual property within their traditional agricultural and hunting\u000d\u000apractices, and the recent developments in international policy and law that are relevant to those\u000d\u000achallenges.\u000d\u000aPaper 2 (section 3, publication ii) examined the broader manner in which diverse instruments of\u000d\u000ainternational law and policy supported or hindered the role of traditional practices in biodiversity\u000d\u000apreservation.

The initial research idea was first conceived at\u000a        a meeting between Lloyd-Sherlock, Barrientos and Mark Gorman, then Chief\u000a        Executive of HAI [Impact Reference (IR)1]. HAI fed into the development\u000a        of the research proposal. It agreed to be a formal partner in the\u000a        project and the subsequent 2008-9 study, and was involved in all stages\u000a        of the work.\u000a      (ii) The studies provided HAI with robust, credible data on social\u000a        pensions, which it used in policy engagement [IR 2, 3]. Lloyd-Sherlock\u000a        continues to engage with HAI weekly, both formally and informally,\u000a        advising and supporting its work on social pensions in multiple ways. In\u000a        2009 he presented the results of the 2008\/9 survey to a\u000a        specially-convened meeting of HAI social pension country officers, and\u000a        in 2012 he participated in a HAI expert meeting on income security in\u000a        old age. The questionnaire used for the 2002 and the follow-up surveys\u000a        has been drawn on for the development of separate HAI surveys of older\u000a        people's wellbeing in countries such as Bolivia.\u000a      HAI is now recognised as the lead international organisation that has\u000a        driven the social pension agenda, with strong support from DFID and\u000a        working closely with national governments and other international\u000a        organisations (http:\/\/www.helpage.org\/download\/510158401a9cc\/).Between\u000a        2007 and 2011 HAI significantly contributed to the implementation or\u000a        extension of social pension schemes in 18 developing countries,\u000a        affecting over 12 million older people. According to the CEO of HAI,\u000a        2006-13:\u000a      `The longitudinal study on Brazil-South Africa social pensions in\u000a        particular has shaped our thinking on the inter-generational impacts of\u000a        social pensions - on older people and their families - and helped to\u000a        support the broader social protection agenda. Peter and Armando's work\u000a        is well respected in the policy and donor community, and their studies\u000a        are regularly cited in key policy debates and policy consultation on\u000a        social protection' [IR4].\u000a      UN agencies: The finding that social pensions had similar effects\u000a      in different countries was of particular interest to the International\u000a      Labour Organisation (ILO). According to an ILO Senior Social Security\u000a      Specialist, the research \"strongly helped underpinning argumentation in\u000a      favour of non- contributory pensions...that a south-south learning\u000a      approach is feasible...and ideas to move on regarding solutions to similar\u000a      countries can be shared with similar benefit among developing countries\"\u000a      [IR5] In 2011 Lloyd-Sherlock presented to a specially-convened social\u000a      protection seminar at the ILO HQ, Geneva.\u000a      Following the first study, Lloyd-Sherlock was lead author of the Global\u000a        Guide for the Implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action\u000a        on Ageing, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs\u000a        in 2008 and circulated to all UN member states [IR6]. In 2010\/11\u000a        Lloyd-Sherlock was seconded to WHO, in part to develop strategies\u000a        linking social pensions to interventions to enhance older people's\u000a        health [IR 7].\u000a      DFID was both a funder and a non-academic stakeholder in the\u000a        2001-3 study. In 2011-2012 Lloyd- Sherlock was engaged by DFID as a\u000a        Senior Research Fellow, partly to advise on social protection issues\u000a        including social pensions. According to the Senior Social Development\u000a        Adviser, (DFID), the research:\u000a      \"showed that DFID pensions can be an effective entry point to reducing\u000a        the economic vulnerability and poverty of whole households....it\u000a        evidenced social pensions\/cash transfers for older persons, particularly\u000a        women, as a less politically contentious route into wider benefits for\u000a        entire households. It also alerted DFID to the need to understand the\u000a        effects of pensions within a wider social development context....The\u000a        fact that DFID then engaged Peter Lloyd-Sherlock as a research fellow\u000a        ensured that the evidence coming out of this research contributed to\u000a        DFID's wider understanding (research) and application (policy) of\u000a        inter-generational or life course approaches to reducing poverty and\u000a        vulnerability\" [IR8].\u000a      The governments of Brazil and South Africa have both been receptive to\u000a        the research findings, with invited presentations to government\u000a        agencies.

The study included a\u000a        quantitative survey, in 2002, of over 2,000 households containing older\u000a        people in rural and urban catchments in Brazil and South Africa\u000a        [Research Reference (RR) 1]. Lloyd-Sherlock jointly led all quantitative\u000a        and qualitative aspects of the research including its conception,\u000a        design, analysis, interpretation and dissemination. The survey was\u000a        complemented with in-depth qualitative interviews with a subset of the\u000a        sample households, and key informant interviews with stakeholders,\u000a        including national and international policymakers. The study\u000a        demonstrated that social pensions were effective in reaching households\u000a        in deprived settings, that a high proportion of pensioners lived with\u000a        young grandchildren, and that in over 80 per cent of cases pensioners\u000a        shared most of their benefit with other household members. The study\u000a        found pensions significantly reduced the intensity of poverty and\u000a        enhanced the financial resilience of older people's households [RR2;\u000a        RR3]. These positive effects were consistent for Brazil and South\u000a        Africa, indicating the international potential for social pensions as a\u000a        pro-poor policy option.\u000a      Lloyd-Sherlock was also joint principal investigator on a follow-up\u000a        survey of the same households in 2008\/9 [RR4]. This combined a\u000a        questionnaire survey with 50 in-depth interviews. Lloyd-Sherlock jointly\u000a        led all aspects of the research. The second survey showed that the\u000a        effect of social pensions on household economic circumstances reported\u000a        for 2002 had been sustained [RR3, 5]; it also found that social pensions\u000a        are associated with high levels of subjective wellbeing in older people.\u000a        However, the study households' overall economic situation was strongly\u000a        influenced by the wider economic context; reduced employment\u000a        opportunities for younger members of coloured households in South Africa\u000a        had led to increased impoverishment. A key finding of the second survey\u000a        is that although social pensions made a significant contribution to\u000a        household wellbeing, this effect was strongly mediated by the wider\u000a        context of labour market dynamics, appropriate health policies and the\u000a        promotion of financial literacy among pensioners. These results called\u000a        for a broader approach to social protection.\u000a      The findings of the second study have fed into new, on-going studies on\u000a        the relationship between social protection and health policy for older\u000a        people. These include research collaborations with the World Health\u000a        Organisation (WHO), an advisory position with the Department for\u000a        International Development (DFID) and a new ESRC funded research project\u000a        led by Lloyd-Sherlock on pensions, health and wellbeing for older people\u000a        in developing countries. They also include NGO collaborations: for\u000a        example, in 2011 Lloyd-Sherlock was a senior adviser for a HelpAge\u000a        International scoping study on the extension of social pensions in\u000a        Indonesia.\u000a      "},{"CaseStudyId":"1435","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"934841","Name":"Swaziland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"933860","Name":"Botswana"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"},{"GeoNamesId":"932692","Name":"Lesotho"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aRHVP had significant policy impacts and a wide reach across southern Africa and beyond.

This led to the expansion of Malawi's pilot social cash\u000d\u000atransfer programme [IR4].\u000d\u000athe government of Botswana commissioned a new Social Development Policy Framework,\u000d\u000adesigned in collaboration with the RHVP research team [IRs 5 and 6]. This work was\u000d\u000aundertaken in 2009-10 and involved an examination of existing social protection provision,\u000d\u000afollowed by a collaborative policy discussion with the Department for Social Services to\u000d\u000aidentify gaps and shifts in emphasis, incorporated into a draft framework.\u000d\u000ain Lesotho, RHVP conducted research on delivering cash payments by mobile phone\u000d\u000aand found that this form of delivery was rapidly understood by vulnerable recipients, and\u000d\u000aresulted in income generation beyond the initial transfers [IR7]. RHVP used this and\u000d\u000aother evidence regarding innovative cash transfer delivery mechanisms to influence\u000d\u000adelivery systems in other southern African countries, including Swaziland, Malawi and\u000d\u000aMozambique.\u000d\u000ain all countries of the southern African region, the research contributed to strengthening\u000d\u000avulnerability assessment and analysis (VAA), from which timely information is provided\u000d\u000ato governments regarding the location of emerging hunger problems across national\u000d\u000aterritory [IR1, with corroboration available from IR8].\u000d\u000abeyond the southern African region, RHVP's work came to the attention of the\u000d\u000aAustralian government aid agency AusAid, which subsequently adopted social\u000d\u000aprotection as one of its aid priorities in the countries and regions that are the main\u000d\u000arecipients of Australian aid [IR9].\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aResearch Impact 3: Policy Outcomes\u000d\u000aRHVP research was instrumental in achieving policy shifts in many countries.

While it\u000d\u000awould be difficult to demonstrate that social cash transfers in Malawi resulted only from RHVP\u000d\u000aactivities, it is also true that without RHVP's co-authorship of Malawi's Social Protection Framework\u000d\u000abased on knowledge gained from the research, the acceptability in public discussion of this type of\u000d\u000apolicy intervention would almost certainly not have reached the critical point at which scaling up of\u000d\u000athe pilot scheme was politically feasible.

Frank Ellis, a full-time UEA professor\u000d\u000athroughout the period of research, was joint principal investigator with two others in the research\u000d\u000adesign, management, analysis and outputs 2005-10. This role built upon earlier research led by\u000d\u000aEllis concerning household level livelihoods and vulnerability in eastern and southern Africa (the\u000d\u000aLADDER programme funded by DFID 1999-2004).\u000d\u000aContext: In the early 2000s, southern Africa experienced a series of food security crises\u000d\u000acharacterised by widespread hunger and mortality from starvation. Emergency food operations were\u000d\u000arequired in six different countries, for several successive years. The cost of these humanitarian\u000d\u000aresponses was high, and due to delays in mobilisation, they frequently arrived too late to prevent\u000d\u000adistress in affected populations. At the inception of RHVP, donors and humanitarian agencies were\u000d\u000aseeking radical change to the policy approach to chronic vulnerability to hunger in the region. The\u000d\u000aresearch dimension of the programme was designed to investigate a range of policy options and to\u000d\u000adeduce from them promising avenues of policy change that could be discussed and debated by\u000d\u000adecision makers across the region.\u000d\u000aResearch Findings: The research confirmed an emerging view that countries and donors should\u000d\u000amove away from ad hoc responses to recurrent crises towards more routine support for citizens\u000d\u000aknown to be persistently prone to hunger and destitution. This finding is captured by the phrase\u000d\u000a`predictable funding for predictable needs'. In practical terms, it implies moving away from short-term food transfers towards regular cash transfers to those most in need. Such cash transfers can\u000d\u000atake many different forms such as social pensions, child support grants and poverty-targeted\u000d\u000atransfers to the most food insecure; however, they all have the characteristic that regular small\u000d\u000apayments enable their recipients to withstand the typical range of fluctuations in their\u000d\u000acircumstances without having to resort to emergency assistance.\u000d\u000aResearch Components and Dates:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000aKnowledge review and gap analysis: undertaken with counterpart teams in each of six\u000d\u000acountries, this exercise compiled an analytical inventory of existing social protection\u000d\u000aprogrammes in each country and identified gaps in coverage, such as the failure to provide\u000d\u000afor older citizens or the lack of effective safety nets to prevent hunger and destitution (2005-06) [Research References (RRs) 1 and 2].\u000d\u000a\u000aRegional evidence-building agenda: also undertaken with counterpart research teams, this\u000d\u000ainvestigated 20 different food security and social transfer schemes across 6 countries, with a\u000d\u000aview to distinguishing practice that worked well and promising innovations in policy design\u000d\u000a(2007-08) [RR1-3].

Since 2008, their work has\u000d\u000a      consistently been used by a wide range of organisations to argue for and\u000d\u000a      support policy change and to obtain funds for investment in reducing\u000d\u000a      vulnerability to HIV\/AIDS in fishing communities.\u000d\u000a    The research has had a significant impact on a wide range of influential\u000d\u000a      actors and in international discourse at different levels:\u000d\u000a    International agencies: The initial 2003-5 wave of research had an\u000d\u000a      immediate impact on a broad range of important international agencies,\u000d\u000a      including bilateral development agencies such as DFID and the Swedish\u000d\u000a      International Development Agency (SIDA). The research contributed to an\u000d\u000a      influential FAO Policy Brief Series and the inclusion of HIV\/AIDS for the\u000d\u000a      first time in FAO's Fisheries Department's bi-annual flagship publication,\u000d\u000a      The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (2006). Its impact has\u000d\u000a      continued since 2008, both through these organizations' toolkits and key\u000d\u000a      resource documents [Impact References (IRs) 1, 2, 3] and via their\u000d\u000a      influence on other development actors [IR4].\u000d\u000a    This impact was facilitated by the research team's strong international\u000d\u000a      networks, including Allison's 2003-7 secondment to FAO. With FAO, Allison\u000d\u000a      and Seeley developed a partnership in 2005 with the WorldFish Center\u000d\u000a      (CGIAR) and SIDA funding Fisheries and HIV\/AIDS in Africa: Investing in\u000d\u000a      Sustainable Solutions (2007-11), a USD 5 million programme of\u000d\u000a      institutional support for African fisheries agencies and health service\u000d\u000a      providers to reduce vulnerability to HIV and AIDS in fishing communities.\u000d\u000a      Allison was involved in writing the pre-proposal to secure funding for FAO\u000d\u000a      and WorldFish; Seeley was a keynote speaker at a workshop in Zambia used\u000d\u000a      to convince SIDA of the importance of investing in reducing vulnerability\u000d\u000a      to AIDS in Africa's fisheries sector. Among many other initiatives, the\u000d\u000a      programme has led to the development and implementation in Zambia of the\u000d\u000a      `Fish Trader+' intervention model to reduce female fish traders'\u000d\u000a      vulnerability to HIV through the formation of savings groups, with funding\u000d\u000a      from SIDA and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [IR5].\u000d\u000a    National Governments: The research has influenced the governments\u000d\u000a      of several countries, including Kenya and Malawi to recognise fisheries\u000d\u000a      workers' vulnerability to HIV\/AIDS and the need to address this in\u000d\u000a      fisheries sector policy [e.g. IR6]. It has strengthened the case for the\u000d\u000a      inclusion of fisherfolk in government HIV plans, including National AIDS\u000d\u000a      Commissions and Ministry of Health Plans [IR7].\u000d\u000a    NGOs: The research findings have also been directly taken up by\u000d\u000a      smaller, national NGOs in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, and Indonesia to develop\u000d\u000a      specific programmes for fisherfolk. For example, HIV and AIDS awareness\u000d\u000a      raising is one of the four main focus areas of Diakonia's Lake Victoria\u000d\u000a      Livelihood Programme, [IR8]; and an Africa Social Development and Health\u000d\u000a      Initiatives (ASDHI) worker used RRs 1, 2, 3 and 4 to persuade the\u000d\u000a      organisation's management committee to extend its HIV services to fishing\u000d\u000a      communities in Uganda in 2008. This initiative grew and attracted local\u000d\u000a      government, NGO and university partnerships and funding. A daily clinic is\u000d\u000a      now held at Ssenyi fish landing site in Ssi-Bukunja sub-county in Buikwe\u000d\u000a      district, where fisherfolk are tested for HIV, treated with ARVs, can\u000d\u000a      access opportunistic infection treatment and are provided with safe male\u000d\u000a      circumcision [IR9].\u000d\u000a    HIV Intervention trials: Fishing communities were included in the\u000d\u000a      establishment of cohorts for HIV intervention trials for the first time in\u000d\u000a      2008, and ARV projects increased their targeting of fisherfolk in 2011.\u000d\u000a    The DEV research made an important contribution to specific interventions\u000d\u000a      by several development agencies. One of these was the Uganda Virus\u000d\u000a      Research Institute's successful bid to the European and Developing\u000d\u000a      Countries Clinical Trials Partnership to include fisherfolk in Uganda and\u000d\u000a      Malawi as key communities in intervention trials partnered by the\u000d\u000a      International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Seeley led the social science\u000d\u000a      research [IR10].\u000d\u000a    The ultimate impact of our work is on citizens in fishing-dependent\u000d\u000a      communities and others who benefit directly and indirectly in their\u000d\u000a      economic, social and sexual networks from improved access to\u000d\u000a      anti-retroviral therapies and basic health (including sexual health)\u000d\u000a      services [see IR8]. This has led to a significant increase in the number\u000d\u000a      of health and livelihood-focused projects and support programmes in\u000d\u000a      fishing-dependent regions, such as the Lake Victoria and Malawi fisheries.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Interdisciplinary research conducted in the School of International\u000d\u000a      Development (2003-4) demonstrated for the first time high HIV prevalence\u000d\u000a      and AIDS incidence among 0.5 billion people in fishing-dependent\u000d\u000a      communities across the world.

Since 2008, Seeley has headed the Social Science\u000d\u000a      Programme of the Medical Research Council\/Uganda Virus Research Institute\u000d\u000a      (UVRI) Research Unit on AIDS based in Entebbe, and has been involved in\u000d\u000a      several projects on HIV among Lake Victoria's fishing communities,\u000d\u000a      including work on preparing cohorts for HIV vaccine trials.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2460","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"241170","Name":"Seychelles"},{"GeoNamesId":"934292","Name":"Mauritius"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Groombridge's research has improved the long-term conservation prospects\u000d\u000a      for two critically- endangered bird species and one of the world's most\u000d\u000a      endangered frogs in Mauritius and the Seychelles. The impact is\u000d\u000a      particularly significant because island biodiversity forms an important\u000d\u000a      portion of global evolutionary heritage and these isolated systems also\u000d\u000a      host some of the world's most endangered species.\u000d\u000a    Impact on practice (see section 5, points A, B, C, D)\u000d\u000a      Groombridge's approach has galvanised conservation action for specific\u000d\u000a      endangered species and their populations in Mauritius and Seychelles.\u000d\u000a    On Seychelles, Groombridge negotiated with local and regional government\u000d\u000a      bodies and brokered support for translocation and establishment of a\u000d\u000a        new population of Seychelles paradise flycatchers, one of the rarest\u000d\u000a      flycatchers in the world. This was a major political and logistical\u000d\u000a      landmark in the conservation management of this species, as lack of\u000d\u000a      agreement had stalled progress towards translocation since 2001, when the\u000d\u000a      Species Action Plan advocated reintroduction to Denis Island (detailed in\u000d\u000a      section 5, point B). In doing so, Groombridge informed the Government\u000d\u000a        of Seychelles National Species Action Plan for the flycatcher and\u000d\u000a      provided a framework for how to successfully carry out reintroductions.\u000d\u000a      This work by Groombridge also paved the way for population genetic work on\u000d\u000a      this species and this has helped to define the emerging field of\u000d\u000a      `reintroduction genetics' with a significant impact on conservation\u000d\u000a        practice. Moreover, phylogenetic work by Groombridge (2009-13) has\u000d\u000a      revealed the Seychelles paradise flycatcher to be one of the most\u000d\u000a      distinctive Indian Ocean species, which not only justifies the field\u000d\u000a      conservation and translocation\/reintroduction efforts by the Government of\u000d\u000a      Seychelles, but also highlights a threatened flycatcher population on\u000d\u000a      Mauritius as sufficiently distinct to warrant conservation (see\u000d\u000a      letter from Mauritius Wildlife Foundation, section 5, point D).\u000d\u000a    On Mauritius, conservation efforts for the Mauritius parakeet benefitted\u000d\u000a      from DNA work undertaken by Groombridge et al (2009-2012) on museum\u000d\u000a      specimens of other endangered and extinct parrots in the Indian Ocean by\u000d\u000a      revealing in an evolutionary context the conservation `value' of the\u000d\u000a      endemic parakeet. Research using different molecular tools revealed how\u000d\u000a      the intensive conservation management of the Mauritius parakeets by the\u000d\u000a      Mauritius Wildlife Foundation has had a beneficial effect on genetic\u000d\u000a      diversity in this species. The Executive Director of the Mauritius\u000d\u000a      Wildlife Foundation states that Groombridge's research has `made a\u000d\u000a        substantial difference to our outlook' (detailed in section 5, point\u000d\u000a      D). This brought long-term benefits by slowing the gradual erosion of\u000d\u000a        genetic diversity and improving the evolutionary viability of the\u000d\u000a      species, a benefit acknowledged by the Mauritius conservation NGO.\u000d\u000a      Groombridge has also tackled problems of infectious disease in this\u000d\u000a      species. Genetic work on a high-profile disease outbreak of Psittacine\u000d\u000a      Beak and Feather disease virus in this species served as a leading\u000d\u000a        case-study worldwide for other parrot conservation programmes to\u000d\u000a      follow where endangered populations have become infected with PBFD virus,\u000d\u000a      for example see Massaro, M., Ortiz-Catedral, L., Julian, L., Galbraith, J.\u000d\u000a      A., Kurenbach, B., Kearvell, J., &amp; Varsani, A.

Genetic work\u000d\u000a      by Groombridge has identified a recently-discovered frog population on\u000d\u000a        Praslin island as evolutionarily distinct (section 5, point D). This\u000d\u000a      clarified the need for surveys on additional Seychelles islands, for\u000d\u000a      example Dr Frauke Fleischer-Dogley, Chief Executive Office, Seychelles\u000d\u000a      Island Foundation states `this confirmation has provided much needed\u000d\u000a        clarity and enabled SIF to orientate its conservation activities to\u000d\u000a        focus on conserving this population' (see section 5, point E). The\u000d\u000a      research also attracted additional conservation funds by local NGOs\u000d\u000a      (notably the Mauritius Wildlife Foundation and the Seychelles Islands\u000d\u000a      Foundation) and developed a 3-year PhD project (by Jim Labisko) on the\u000d\u000a      evolutionary conservation genetics and restoration of sooglossid frogs.\u000d\u000a    Impact on public awareness and understanding (see section 5, point E)\u000d\u000a      Groombridge has improved awareness and understanding of his field amongst\u000d\u000a      the public and the policy community through the showcasing of his projects\u000d\u000a      as examples of best practice in UK Government documents (DEFRA and\u000d\u000a      the annual report of the Darwin Initiative, section 5 point E) and in\u000d\u000a      books targeted at a wide practitioner audience. A published book on\u000d\u000a      Reintroduction Biology illustrates the work by Groombridge and defines the\u000d\u000a      `gold standard' for genetic management of reintroductions for conservation\u000d\u000a      (700 copies sold, third highest seller for Wiley in this area).\u000d\u000a    Impact on policy (see section 5, points A, B, D, E)\u000d\u000a      Groombridge's work has led to increased investment by the UK to\u000d\u000a        improve training and capacity-building in conservation across the\u000d\u000a      Indian Ocean. Darwin Initiative\/DEFRA recently provided &#163;256,000 for\u000d\u000a      2012-2015 to support the work (to train 5 local biologists from\u000d\u000a      Seychelles, with interisland training involving Mauritius), and this\u000d\u000a      re-affirms the UK's commitment to conserving island biodiversity (see\u000d\u000a      section 3, `funding'). This funding will be used to unite local\u000d\u000a      conservation NGOs with UK-based expertise to develop the skills and\u000d\u000a      capacity of local biologists. Groombridge's leadership of this project has\u000d\u000a      resulted in the additional award of a &#8364;400,000 (&#163;342,500) European Science\u000d\u000a      Foundation grant to establish a four-year research network (`ParrotNet':\u000d\u000a      COST Action ES- 1304) to coordinate European and international research\u000d\u000a      into the environmental, agricultural and societal issues surrounding\u000d\u000a      invasive parrots. Therefore an important aspect of the impact of Jim\u000d\u000a      Groombridge's work is that he has persuaded a range of organisations to\u000d\u000a      extend and increase funding for conservation work for endangered species\u000d\u000a      in Seychelles and Mauritius.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Molecular and evolutionary research by Dr Jim Groombridge at the\u000d\u000a      University of Kent, (2003 onwards, lecturer 2003-2008, Senior Lecturer\u000d\u000a      2008-2012, Reader 2012-), undertaken in partnership with the Mauritius\u000d\u000a      Wildlife Foundation, the Seychelles Islands Foundation and Government\u000d\u000a      Ministries of both states, has identified unexpected evolutionary\u000d\u000a      distinctiveness and established high conservation priority for rare\u000d\u000a      populations of birds and frogs on Mauritius and Seychelles.

A central focus of his research is the\u000d\u000a      theoretical and practical aspects of endangered species conservation and\u000d\u000a      the application of population, genetic, morphological and phylogenetic\u000d\u000a      studies to enhance understanding of the biological processes that guide\u000d\u000a      the conservation trajectory of endangered species. Since 2006 Groombridge\u000d\u000a      has focused his research on conservation of island biodiversity, with an\u000d\u000a      emphasis on the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius and Seychelles. His work\u000d\u000a      in this area combines the practice of field monitoring and population\u000d\u000a      recovery techniques with the more theoretical approaches of evolutionary\u000d\u000a      phylogenetics and conservation genetics at the population level. This work\u000d\u000a      has had two key outcomes: (i) it has revealed avian biodiversity to be\u000d\u000a      much more evolutionarily ancient (and therefore of heightened conservation\u000d\u000a      value) than previously thought, and (ii) it has successfully tackled\u000d\u000a      challenging conservation problems, such as island-to-island\u000d\u000a      reintroductions and studies of genetics and infectious disease. This\u000d\u000a      resulted in important changes in approaches to conservation. Groombridge\u000d\u000a      led three research initiatives which have had particularly significant\u000d\u000a      impact on conservation policy and practice in the region:\u000d\u000a    (i) Molecular work from 2011-2012 on a newly-discovered\u000d\u000a        population of Seychelles' sooglossid frog. Groombridge's research\u000d\u000a      ruled out the possibility of it being a recent human- mediated\u000d\u000a      introduction and instead confirmed it to be evolutionarily distinct and\u000d\u000a      therefore worthy of conservation investment. This research galvanised\u000d\u000a      efforts to save this species (see section 3, publication iii).\u000d\u000a    (ii) Evolutionary research from 2009-2013 on biogeography,\u000d\u000a        morphology and population genetics confirmed the Seychelles paradise\u000d\u000a      flycatcher to be one of the most evolutionarily distinct species; this\u000d\u000a      finding then justified an ambitious translocation initiative by\u000d\u000a      Groombridge that produced a sustainable `safety net' population for the\u000d\u000a      species. This reintroduced population established successfully and\u000d\u000a      produced second-generation offspring within two years, along with\u000d\u000a      sustained population growth. This paved the way for a study of the genetic\u000d\u000a      effects of reintroduction that demonstrates how genetic diversity can\u000d\u000a      still be lost even from severely-bottlenecked species. This research led\u000d\u000a      to the recovery of this species (see section 3, publication v).\u000d\u000a    (iii) Molecular studies from 2009-2012 involving sequencing\u000d\u000a        DNA from 200-year-old specimens of extinct species of parrots from\u000d\u000a      Reunion Island and Seychelles. These studies led to a new understanding of\u000d\u000a      the evolutionary distinctiveness of an endangered species of parakeet on\u000d\u000a      Mauritius. Population-level genetic work on the Mauritius parakeet\u000d\u000a      described how long-term intensive population management had genetically\u000d\u000a      benefitted the recovered population; simultaneous work on a severe disease\u000d\u000a      outbreak amongst those parakeets identified how a novel mutation in the\u000d\u000a      virus most likely led to the outbreak. This was important because it\u000d\u000a      provided field biologists with guidance on how best to manage the parakeet\u000d\u000a      population. The underpinning research led to better management of the\u000d\u000a      parakeet population (see section 3, publications ii &amp; iv).\u000d\u000a    Between 2009 and 2013 Groombridge secured a total of &#163;1.1 million of\u000d\u000a      external funding for research and assistance in implementing conservation\u000d\u000a      actions for island biodiversity. The awards include a &#163;234,000 grant from\u000d\u000a      the Darwin Initiative (DEFRA, UK, grant number 15-009) to support a\u000d\u000a      translocation of Seychelles paradise flycatchers; &#163;216,000 from the\u000d\u000a      Leverhulme Trust to support research into the disease outbreak amongst\u000d\u000a      Mauritius parakeets; and two NERC CASE PhD studentships (ref #\u000d\u000a      NER\/S\/A\/2006\/14144 and F01290X\/1) to support conservation genetic and\u000d\u000a      immunological research on endemic and invasive parakeets on Mauritius\u000d\u000a      (details in section 3, points a, b, c, d).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2465","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe work undertaken by Griffiths et al. has already had significant impact in informing debate\u000d\u000aamongst practitioners and volunteers and in redefining best practice in the field.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aIn addition to the new research (see section 3, publications i, ii, iii, iv), a key element of this project\u000d\u000ahas been consultation and engagement between the academic team and professionals and\u000d\u000avolunteers on the ground.

Through discussion and dissemination at\u000d\u000athese events the new protocols have already informed practitioner debate and had a significant\u000d\u000aimpact on survey practice in Britain (see section 5, points A, D, E).\u000d\u000aA project report summarising the research and workshop outputs was published in March 2013\u000d\u000a(`Survey protocols for the British herpetofauna.

The new protocols are being adopted into policy guidance in England, Wales and\u000d\u000aScotland. They will help improve the management and conservation of important amphibian and\u000d\u000areptile species; and they also have economic advantages for planners, developers and\u000d\u000aenvironmental consultancies who will benefit from the more streamlined and science-based\u000d\u000aapproach to monitoring. Moreover, the protocols are likely to have a wider impact, for example in\u000d\u000ainforming initiatives such as the National Ecosystem Assessment, and with strong potential for\u000d\u000ainternational adoption in future.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis case study describes how innovative new survey protocols for amphibians and reptiles in the\u000d\u000aUK are already changing conservation and planning practice in the UK. The new protocols,\u000d\u000adeveloped by a team led by Professor Richard Griffiths at the University of Kent, make surveys\u000d\u000amore effective and provide guidance for obtaining better data on trends for these species. Thanks\u000d\u000ato a series of engagement workshops held in 2011-12, the team's research has already informed\u000d\u000abest practice amongst ecologists, consultants and fieldworkers involved in professional practice\u000d\u000aand national recording schemes. Moreover, the revised and science-based survey protocols,\u000d\u000apublished in March 2013, are in the process of being adopted within policy, best practice and\u000d\u000astatutory guidance in England, Wales and Scotland.\u000d\u000aPrior to this research, survey protocols for amphibians and reptiles had changed little for some 20\u000d\u000ayears, and were not science-based. Consequently, the amount of survey effort required to reliably\u000d\u000adetermine population status was controversial. With developers forced to spend up to &#163;125 million\u000d\u000aper year to mitigate impacts on some species, this issue was particularly pressing within the\u000d\u000acommercial sector. Using statistical models, Griffiths' team derived recommendations that resolved\u000d\u000ahow much effort was required to reliably detect whether a species was present or absent from a\u000d\u000asite. If it were not for this research, these important protocols would not have changed, and\u000d\u000asurveys would not have been as cost-effective or as reliable. Indeed, despite several decades of\u000d\u000aintensive recording activity, there were insufficient data to provide a meaningful statement on long-\u000d\u000aterm trends of UK species for the recent National Ecosystem Assessment.\u000d\u000a","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000d\u000aUniversity of Kent\u000d\u000a","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a\u000ai.

The\u000d\u000aresults of this research are now being adopted within guidance provided by the government\u000d\u000aconservation agencies, and subsequently by professional consultants and NGOs involved with\u000d\u000asurvey and monitoring.\u000d\u000aAll species of amphibian and reptile in Britain have some degree of legal protection. Work by\u000d\u000aGriffiths' team showed that up to &#163;125 million is being spent annually on efforts to mitigate the\u000d\u000aimpacts of development on just one of these, the great crested newt. However, previous survey\u000d\u000aprotocols have been largely unable to provide the evidence needed to show that such expensive\u000d\u000aefforts are effective in conserving populations. The underpinning research focused on two\u000d\u000afundamental issues. Firstly, conservation assessments usually use simple counts of animals.\u000d\u000aThese do not take into account variation in detectability, and can lead to `false absences'. This\u000d\u000ameans that the counts may actually be a better reflection of factors influencing detection (e.g\u000d\u000aweather conditions, vegetation, surveyor expertise) than they are of the number of animals\u000d\u000apresent. The research used capture-mark-recapture and occupancy models to estimate levels of\u000d\u000adetectability using different survey methods. Secondly, the amount of survey effort required to\u000d\u000areliably detect animals or populations has been largely based on anecdotal evidence. The research\u000d\u000aused statistical models to determine the optimal combination of survey visits and survey methods\u000d\u000afor a given survey goal. The project has therefore resolved long-running debates about how much\u000d\u000asurvey effort was needed to obtain data on population status that was statistically defensible.\u000d\u000aThe research was funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation via two 2-year grants (2007-8:\u000d\u000aamphibians; 2009-10: reptiles; details in section 3, points a, b). These were channelled through the\u000d\u000aUniversity of Sussex with Co-PIs at Sussex (Beebee) and Kent (Griffiths, employed at Kent 1995 to\u000d\u000apresent), and with the project officer (Dr David Sewell) based at Kent (2007-2011 employed by\u000d\u000aSussex but based at Kent; 2011-present employed by and based at Kent). A NERC Knowledge\u000d\u000aExchange grant (2010-12) followed these grants and provided the vehicle for discussion and\u000d\u000adissemination of the findings; it involved the same partnership with colleagues at the University of\u000d\u000aSussex but was administered through Kent. All stages of the research have involved close\u000d\u000acollaboration with the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science at Kent. Therefore,\u000d\u000athe contribution of leading researchers at Kent (notably Griffiths) was substantial. Professor\u000d\u000aGriffiths is a leading authority on amphibian and reptile conservation, as evidenced by his election\u000d\u000aas President of the British Herpetological Society and his membership of several influential trusts\u000d\u000aand committees within the field.\u000d\u000aSince 2008 this research has resulted in two papers (one published in Biological Conservation, the\u000d\u000aother in PLoS ONE) which built on Griffiths' earlier research in the same area. The first paper\u000d\u000aevaluated amphibian survey protocols for the National Amphibian and Reptile Recording Scheme\u000d\u000a(NARRS) in Britain, which aims to assess the status of five widespread amphibian species.\u000d\u000aSurveys were undertaken by trained volunteers and researchers in contrasting landscapes over\u000d\u000atwo years, and occupancy modelling was used to determine covariates of detection, and to\u000d\u000aoptimise the number of surveys and number of methods required. In the second study the team\u000d\u000aused the same occupancy modelling approach on all six native reptile species in the UK to\u000d\u000adetermine: (i) occupancy and detectability of all the species across a range of sites; (ii) the optimal\u000d\u000anumber of survey visits to carry out per site; and (iii) the required sampling effort to detect\u000d\u000apopulation declines at different power levels. The approach described in the studies has been\u000d\u000ainstrumental in finding the best compromises between rigor and simplicity when volunteers are\u000d\u000aused in large-scale surveys.\u000d\u000aIt became clear that the results of this research were of considerable interest to statutory\u000d\u000aconservation agencies, professional ecologists, planners, policy makers and reserve managers, all\u000d\u000aof whom carry out amphibian and reptile surveys as part of their work.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"3685","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Geoengineering RD&amp;D is at a very early stage, but it is developing\u000a      fast, and international bodies such as the International Panel on Climate\u000a      Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) have\u000a      recognized that it is certain to become very significant within the next\u000a      few years.

Currently, geoengineering\u000a      technologies are largely concepts, but there is significant interest in\u000a      developing them as options to supplement conventional greenhouse gas\u000a      reduction and adaptation policies.\u000a    Significant public policy concerns, identified in a Royal Society Working\u000a      Group Report Geoengineering the Climate: Science, Governance and\u000a        Uncertainty (2009) (of which Rayner and Redgwell were co-authors),\u000a      are diverse and include, for example, worries that even conducting\u000a      research into such technologies might undermine efforts to achieve\u000a      greenhouse gas mitigation; concerns that deliberate terraformation of the\u000a      planet is intrinsically unethical and therefore that such research is in\u000a      itself indefensible; and fear of unintended consequences from eventual\u000a      field trials, such as disruption of agriculture. Hence there has been a\u000a      strong interest in social science research to inform whether, and how,\u000a      RD&amp;D of geoengineering technologies may be conducted safely and\u000a      responsibly. The report concluded that appropriate governance arrangements\u000a      would be a necessary precondition for RD&amp;D of geoengineering. In\u000a      response to the concerns expressed in the report, a group of researchers,\u000a      largely from Oxford, developed a set of five Oxford Principles [Section\u000a        3: R1] for the governance of geoengineering, resulting from a\u000a      meta-analysis, which wove together two longstanding strands of Oxford\u000a      University research on: (1) the governance of emerging controversial\u000a      technologies, which unpacked a variety of imperatives to ensure public\u000a      engagement at an early stage;[R2] and (2) alternative policy\u000a      strategies for dealing with climate change, which stressed the need for\u000a      new societal investments in research to develop and deploy novel\u000a      technology for managing climate change.[R4]\u000a    The Oxford Principles, as they have become known, were designed to apply\u000a      to a heterogeneous range of technologies from the stage of early research\u000a      through to implementation. The Principles synthesize social science\u000a      insights from research into social values evident among the public in\u000a      relation to novel technologies, such as GM foods, nanomaterials, and human\u000a      enhancement technologies, into a set of guidelines for the governance of\u000a      research on climate geoengineering. While the Principles were not the\u000a      result of a single empirical research project, they represent the\u000a      distillation of a decade of research on the regulation of frontier\u000a      research (e.g. [R2-R6]) as well as collaboration between\u000a      researchers both at Oxford and beyond.\u000a    The Principles are deliberately `high level', and require the elaboration\u000a      of specific research protocols for each geoengineering technique at each\u000a      stage of development from concept, to design, to prototype through limited\u000a      and larger-scale field trials, to eventual possible deployment. The\u000a      recommendation based on the research is that, at each `stage gate',\u000a      researchers and developers must demonstrate how they have addressed each\u000a      of the five Oxford Principles for the next stage of RD&amp;D before they\u000a      embark on it.\u000a    1) \"Geoengineering should be regulated as a public good\" was based\u000a      on ESRC-funded research (`Science in Society' Programme), directed by\u000a      Rayner including c.45 projects around the UK. Finding: Novel\u000a      technologies involving new risks meet resistance where they are perceived\u000a      as serving private interests rather than the public good.[R5]\u000a    2) \"Public participation in geoengineering decision-making\" also\u000a      drew on the `Science in Society' Programme, and was informed by Rayner's\u000a      research on expert and public engagement in public decision-making [R3]\u000a      and controversial technology development.[R6] Finding: Public\u000a      engagement is an important factor in the social licence to operate, as\u000a      well as substantively beneficial in refining and improving technical\u000a      outcomes.\u000a    3) \"Disclosure of geoengineering research and open publication of\u000a        results\" drew on collaboration between Savulescu and InSIS\u000a      researchers exploring technology that enhances human cognitive and\u000a      physical capacities. Finding: This research highlighted the\u000a      propensity of the pharmaceutical sector to avoid publication of negative\u000a      clinical trials.[R7]\u000a    4) \"Independent assessment of impacts\" drew extensively on InSIS\u000a      research on management of emerging technologies, focusing on competing\u000a      institutional principles for consent, liability, and trust with regard to\u000a      risk and new technology.[R3,R6] Finding: This research highlighted\u000a      the apparent lack of institutional learning with the introduction of new\u000a      technology.\u000a    5) \"Governance before deployment\" was informed by research on\u000a      establishing appropriate governance for emerging technologies.[R5]\u000a        Finding: This research revealed that public trust in institutional\u000a      arrangements depends on organizational commitments.\u000a    Researchers involved:\u000a    The articulation of these Principles was initiated by Professor Steve Rayner\u000a      (Professor of Science and Civilization since 2003 and Director of the\u000a      Institute for Science, Innovation, and Society (InSIS) at Oxford\u000a      University) at a research workshop convened under the auspices of the\u000a      Oxford Geoengineering Programme early in 2010.

As a result of\u000d\u000a      ODID research led by CRISE, horizontal inequality is widely cited as one\u000d\u000a      of the key causes of conflict, and thus its reduction has become part of\u000d\u000a      policy towards fragile states at the major development agencies. The\u000d\u000a      concept has also influenced a number of governments and is reflected in a\u000d\u000a      range of policy documents.\u000d\u000a    DFID: CRISE research was funded by DFID in order to provide the\u000d\u000a      evidence base for policy. It contributed to a shift in DFID development\u000d\u000a      strategy towards a recognition that existing approaches were not always\u000d\u000a      appropriate in fragile and conflict-affected states and donor policy\u000d\u000a      needed to tackle disparities. As DFID stated in a news item on its website\u000d\u000a      on 5 January 2012, `by turning the focus of policy towards inequality and\u000d\u000a      the neglected dimensions of political, social and economic inclusivity,\u000d\u000a      CRISE's research has had a significant impact on policy making and\u000d\u000a      development strategy' (see https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/dfid-research-strengthening-work-in-conflict-affected-countries-through-research).\u000d\u000a    The new DFID emphasis was apparent in a series of policy papers,\u000d\u000a      including the 2006 DFID White Paper Preventing Violent Conflict\u000d\u000a      which notes that exclusion of social groups and inequality can lead to\u000d\u000a      conflict (p 14) and cites a 2005 paper on social exclusion prepared by\u000d\u000a      CRISE for DFID. The 2010 DFID Practice Paper Building Peaceful States\u000d\u000a        and Societies [see Section 5: C1] has a new emphasis on\u000d\u000a      inclusivity, influenced by the research by CRISE among others, and the\u000d\u000a      first theory on the causes of conflict listed in this paper (Table 1, p\u000d\u000a      19) is the HI approach. The ractice paper was supported by a number of\u000d\u000a      briefings designed to aid implementation of new OECD-DAC Principles\u000d\u000a        for Good International Engagement in Fragile States &amp; Situations.\u000d\u000a      Of these, Briefing Paper D: Promoting Non-discrimination [C2]\u000d\u000a      draws extensively on the CRISE research [R1, R3] (see, for\u000d\u000a      example, pp 2-5).\u000d\u000a    OECD: CRISE was involved in helping develop the new OECD-DAC Principles\u000d\u000a      through a DFID- commissioned consultancy paper on fragile states with the\u000d\u000a      result that non-discrimination, inclusive development and avoiding social\u000d\u000a      exclusion formed part of the principles (Principle 6) [C3]. A 2011\u000d\u000a      OECD publication exploring how far the Principles had been carried out [C4]\u000d\u000a      found that Principle 6 in particular was on track. In 2010, Stewart was\u000d\u000a      asked by the OECD to advise on HIs, and the OECD's 2011 policy guidance Supporting\u000d\u000a        Statebuilding in Situations of Conflict and Fragility [C5]\u000d\u000a      makes a number of references to HIs (citing [R3]) and the need to\u000d\u000a      take them into account (pp 31, 46, 47, 52, 60, 67).\u000d\u000a    World Bank: CRISE research influenced the work of the World Bank's\u000d\u000a      Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit, encouraging a shift in focus\u000d\u000a      from income inequality towards HIs and their link to conflict. According\u000d\u000a      to the then-manager of the unit, speaking in an interview about the\u000d\u000a      research: `[t]he insight from the CRISE work was that we were measuring\u000d\u000a      the wrong thing' (see http:\/\/www.ox.ac.uk\/research\/social_sciences\/projects\/investigating.html)\u000d\u000a    Stewart was asked to contribute a background paper to the World Bank's\u000d\u000a      2011 World Development Report [C6] and had several\u000d\u000a      discussions with the main authors in London and Washington. The report\u000d\u000a      cites `Horizontal Inequalities and Identity' as one of the theoretical\u000d\u000a      strands in the literature on conflict on which it draws (p. 75) and notes\u000d\u000a      HIs among the economic and political stresses that can lead to conflict\u000d\u000a      (p. 79). It cites (p. 82) &#216;stby's regression analysis of 55 countries [R3,\u000d\u000a        Ch 7] and Langer's research on C&#244;te d'Ivoire [R3, Ch. 8],\u000d\u000a      among other references to the research (eg pp 6, 17, 168, 260).\u000d\u000a    Stewart was also invited to be a lead speaker at a 2010 World Bank\u000d\u000a      Headline Seminar entitled Promoting Inclusive Growth and Employment in\u000d\u000a        Fragile Situations. The World Bank-prepared report of this meeting [C7]\u000d\u000a      lists the link between HIs and conflict as the first `key finding'.\u000d\u000a      Subsequent policy guidance has included `justice' as a critical objective.\u000d\u000a    United Nations: CRISE was contracted by the UNDP Bureau of Crisis\u000d\u000a      Prevention and Recovery (BCPR) to co-edit a report on policy in\u000d\u000a      post-conflict countries [C8]. One of the report's six `key\u000d\u000a      conclusions' was that sustained post-conflict recovery requires economic\u000d\u000a      growth that addresses horizontal inequalities (p. xxiii). The UNDP's 2009\u000d\u000a      guidance note on Governance in Conflict Prevention and Recovery [C9]\u000d\u000a      cites [R1] and [R3] and notes that `[a]s Stewart\u000d\u000a      convincingly argues, the likelihood of social unrest and violent conflict\u000d\u000a      is higher in contexts with significant political or economic horizontal\u000d\u000a      inequalities - especially when both types are combined' (p. 3).\u000d\u000a    CRISE research has also been taken up by the Human Development Report\u000d\u000a      Office (HDRO) and is drawn on in a number of its flagship global Human\u000d\u000a      Development Reports. The 2010 Human Development Report, The\u000d\u000a        Real Wealth of Nations: Pathways to Human Development, includes\u000d\u000a      discussion of HIs in its review of human development challenges (pp.\u000d\u000a      75-6). The 2011 Human Development Report, Sustainability and\u000d\u000a        Equity: A Better Future for All, notes the role HIs can play\u000d\u000a      in the link between natural resources and conflict (p. 76) [C10].\u000d\u000a    Impact at the national level: Stewart was commissioned by UNDP\u000d\u000a      Malaysia to review Malaysian policies towards HIs and make recommendations\u000d\u000a      for future policy. She reported on her results to government planners in\u000d\u000a      2011. She put forward the view that Malaysia should move from an emphasis\u000d\u000a      on direct to indirect policies towards HIs, but should monitor HIs with\u000d\u000a      the aim of a continued reduction, while also focusing on regional and\u000d\u000a      political inequalities. Her input was `instrumental in framing the\u000d\u000a      situational analysis and the areas for priorities for the inclusive growth\u000d\u000a      agenda' to be pursued by the Malaysian government in cooperation with the\u000d\u000a      UNDP in 2013-15, according to the Assistant Resident Representative\u000d\u000a      (Programme), UNDP Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam. [C11].\u000d\u000a    Langer and Stewart were also invited to Kenya for discussions with the\u000d\u000a      prime minister and his chief economic adviser on policies towards\u000d\u000a      horizontal inequalities and social cohesion [C12]. Ex- Ghanaian\u000d\u000a      President John Kufuor, who gave the 52nd Anniversary of Nigerian\u000d\u000a      Independence lecture in Abuja in September 2012, cited `imbalanced\u000d\u000a      development involving horizontal inequalities' as an important source of\u000d\u000a      conflict that was impeding Nigerian progress (see http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201209190753.html).\u000a      This followed a public meeting and media appearances in Ghana by CRISE in\u000d\u000a      2006\u000d\u000a    DFID commissioned a special study to ascertain the extent and\u000d\u000a      significance of horizontal inequalities in Nepal, and subsequently\u000d\u000a      designed its development programme to target particularly the poorest\u000d\u000a      regions and poorest groups [C1]. This approach continues in the\u000d\u000a      World Bank's Poverty Alleviation Fund, which is directed towards targeting\u000d\u000a      excluded and vulnerable groups.

The Oxford researchers were\u000d\u000a      responsible for the analytical framework, research design, comparative\u000d\u000a      data analysis and most of the research publications.\u000d\u000a    This research started from the premise that inequalities between groups -\u000d\u000a      which Stewart [see Section 3: R1] termed `horizontal inequalities'\u000d\u000a      (HIs) - played a greater role in provoking conflict than had previously\u000d\u000a      been recognised. This insight resulted from pioneering work carried out at\u000d\u000a      ODID in the 1990s on the relationship between war and underdevelopment.\u000d\u000a      Stewart and FitzGerald [R2] opened a new field of enquiry by\u000d\u000a      exploring the workings of economies during conflict and suggesting\u000d\u000a      policies to protect well-being while conflict was ongoing. Subsequent work\u000d\u000a      indicated that the conventional `vertical' measure of inequality (between\u000d\u000a      households) was not a good predictor of conflict and nor were individual\u000d\u000a      economic interests (`greed'). In contrast, horizontal inequalities -\u000d\u000a      inequalities between culturally defined groups (eg. religious or ethnic\u000d\u000a      groups) in different dimensions (eg political, socioeconomic or cultural\u000d\u000a      dimensions) - were strongly associated with potential conflict [R3].\u000d\u000a    Researchers at CRISE compared three areas of the world to understand why\u000d\u000a      some multi-ethnic and multi-religious countries are peaceful while others\u000d\u000a      succumb to violence. Using a multidisciplinary approach combining\u000d\u000a      economics, political science, sociology and anthropology, the team\u000d\u000a      compared sets of countries that had followed different trajectories:\u000d\u000a      Indonesia and Malaysia in Southeast Asia; Nigeria, Ghana and C&#244;te d'Ivoire\u000d\u000a      in West Africa; and Peru, Bolivia and Guatemala in Latin America. The team\u000d\u000a      analysed each country's history of conflict or stability and gathered\u000d\u000a      qualitative and quantitative data on horizontal inequalities. `Perceptions\u000d\u000a      surveys' were carried out to clarify how people approached questions of\u000d\u000a      ethnicity, religion, discrimination and inequality and how these attitudes\u000d\u000a      affected their actions [R3, Part III]. Cross-country and\u000d\u000a      within-country regression analyses of quantitative data were also\u000d\u000a      conducted [R3, Part II].\u000d\u000a    The research clearly showed that where horizontal inequality is high, the\u000d\u000a      probability of conflict increases, and that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Conflict is more likely where political and socioeconomic HIs are both\u000d\u000a        high and correlated; where they are not correlated between groups,\u000d\u000a        conflict is less likely [R3, Part I, II and III];\u000d\u000a      Inclusive (or power-sharing) government tends to reduce the likelihood\u000d\u000a        of conflict [R3, Ch 7 and Part III];\u000d\u000a      Inequality of cultural recognition is an additional motive for\u000d\u000a        conflict and cultural `events' can act as a trigger [R3, Ch 3];\u000d\u000a      Mobilisation depends on people's personal circumstances: political\u000d\u000a        exclusion is especially important for leaders, while individuals'\u000d\u000a        feelings of economic and physical insecurity play a major role for those\u000d\u000a        who are mobilised [R3, Part III];\u000d\u000a      The dominance of natural resource exports can be a significant cause\u000d\u000a        of conflict, due to their fiscal and locational effects on horizontal\u000d\u000a        inequality [R4].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Policy implications were developed for fragile states generally [R3],\u000d\u000a      in relation to post-conflict development [R5] and towards\u000d\u000a      international trade [R6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3714","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"272103","Name":"Lebanon"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"49518","Name":"Rwanda"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3617476","Name":"Nicaragua"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1252634","Name":"Bhutan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"3585968","Name":"El Salvador"},{"GeoNamesId":"3625428","Name":"Venezuela"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since its first publication in working paper form in 2007, the AF method\u000a      has been adapted by several governments to create tailored\u000a      multidimensional measures of poverty and well-being which contribute\u000a      directly to poverty reduction [see Section 5: C1-C5].

Covering over 100 countries,\u000a      the MPI shows the nature and extent of poverty from the household up to\u000a      the regional, national and international level.

Based on their\u000a      research, Alkire and Foster participated as international experts in a\u000a      two-year process, applying the AF model to suit the specifications of the\u000a      Mexican government via a two-way dialogue process. Mexico's official\u000a      multidimensional poverty measure, using a version of the AF method, was\u000a      launched in 2009 and updated in 2011 and 2013. This pioneering measure\u000a      reflects people's simultaneous deprivations in income and social rights,\u000a      including health, housing, education and food, enabling policy-makers to\u000a      devise more effective poverty-reduction strategies [C1].\u000a    Government of Colombia &#8212; National MPI and Poverty-Reduction Strategy\u000a    In 2011, the government of Colombia launched a national multidimensional\u000a      poverty measure using the AF method and developed in close collaboration\u000a      with OPHI researchers. Devised by Colombia's Ministry of Planning, the\u000a      measure reflects the national plan's goals and targets. It has been\u000a      cascaded through the policy process, and is used for policy coordination,\u000a      for geographical and household targeting, and for monitoring and\u000a      evaluation. The MPI is now an official statistic, updated annually based\u000a      on new survey data [C2].\u000a    Government of Bhutan &#8212; Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index\u000a    In 2008, the president of the government of Bhutan's Centre for Bhutan\u000a      Studies (CBS) co-developed the first (pilot) GNH Index with Alkire using\u000a      the AF method, and co-authored two OPHI working papers. The index was\u000a      updated and strengthened in 2012, again using the AF method, with Alkire\u000a      as co-author [C3]. The landmark measure has nine domains and 33\u000a      indicators, and the surrounding policy framework creates incentives for\u000a      the government, as well as NGOs and businesses, to increase GNH. Bhutan\u000a      has also adapted the AF method to construct a national MPI, with tailored\u000a      indicators that reflect deprivations in rudimentary services and core\u000a      human needs. \u000a    USAID and IFPRI &#8212; Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI)\u000a     Alkire and OPHI consultant Ana Vaz constructed the WEAI in 2012 in\u000a      partnership with the US government's Feed the Future initiative, the\u000a      United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the\u000a      International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The WEAI, which was\u000a      commissioned by the US government to monitor the impact of its Feed the\u000a      Future interventions, captures women's empowerment in the agricultural\u000a      sector directly, without using proxies such as income and education [R6].\u000a      Alkire and Vaz developed the index from pilot survey data using an\u000a      adaptation of the AF method. The work has now been expanded to\u000a      representative datasets in 19 countries, and there is uptake from NGOs,\u000a      including CARE and Oxfam, and interest from the UN's Food and Agriculture\u000a      Organisation (FAO) in further implementations [C7, C8].\u000a    In addition to the users above, the AF method has been adapted and\u000a      applied at the national or subnational level in China [C4],\u000a      Malaysia, and Minas Gerais and S&#227;o Paulo in Brazil [C5].

The simplest measure reflects both the\u000a      incidence of poverty (the percentage of the population who are poor), and\u000a      the intensity of poverty (the share of deprivations suffered by each\u000a      household); other measures also reflect the depth and severity of poverty.\u000a    The AF method identifies who is poor by considering the joint\u000a      deprivations they experience. It then aggregates that information to\u000a      reflect societal poverty in a way that is robust and decomposable; for\u000a      example by gender, ethnicity or geographic region. The final measures can\u000a      be broken down by indicator, after identification, to show the\u000a      composition. It is a very flexible methodology; different dimensions (e.g.\u000a      nutrition) and indicators (e.g. stunting) can be used, depending on the\u000a      requirements of the policy-makers concerned, to target support to the very\u000a      poorest accurately.\u000a    Following the development of the AF method, a number of papers were\u000a      published by OPHI in which authors used the new methodology to analyse\u000a      multidimensional poverty in countries and continents around the world; for\u000a      example, in Bhutan, India and Latin America [R4, R5]. These papers\u000a      demonstrated how policy insights arise from the new methodology, by\u000a      showing how deprivations vary between groups of people and regions.\u000a      Methodological papers developed applications such as targeting, and tools\u000a      such as standard errors. A manual, Multidimensional Poverty\u000a        Measurement and Analysis, will be published by Oxford University\u000a      Press in 2014.\u000a    By comparing the new multidimensional measures with standard income\u000a      measures of poverty, this research drew attention to how the AF measures\u000a      complement income poverty statistics. In particular, the AF measure\u000a      provides a meaningful at-a-glance number, which can then be broken down to\u000a      reveal how many are poor, how they are poor, and who are the poorest [R6].\u000a      The fact that the AF measure is both compact and transparent makes it\u000a      attractive to policy-makers wishing to coordinate policy, target resources\u000a      more effectively and monitor the impact of programmes over time [R7].\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    \u000a      Sabina Alkire, Director, OPHI (2007-present)\u000a      James Foster, OPHI Research Associate (2007-present), OPHI Visiting\u000a        Fellow (2006-07), and Professor of Economics and International Affairs,\u000a        George Washington University\u000a      Jos&#233; Manuel Roche, OPHI Research Officer (2009-present)\u000a      Maria Emma Santos, OPHI Research Associate (2010-present), OPHI\u000a        Research Officer (2008-10) and Universidad Nacional del Sur and CONICET,\u000a        Argentina\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3931","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The outcome of NRI's research has been adopted in the design of projects,\u000a      for staple grains as well as export commodities, funded by donors\u000a      including the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC), the European Union, the\u000a      World Bank and USAID in West, Eastern and Southern Africa. Progress in\u000a      developing the NRI-promoted WRS model is most advanced in Tanzania, making\u000a      it possible to mainstream inventory finance for export commodities such as\u000a      cashew and extend it to food staples such as maize. Demonstrable benefits\u000a      to smallholders are outlined below by commodity, followed by impacts on\u000a      national and regional policy.\u000a    Cashew\u000a    Almost all cashew nuts produced in Tanzania are now marketed through the\u000a      WRS - first piloted in 2007 to make raw cashew marketing more transparent.\u000a      The WRS allows primary (village-level) Agricultural Marketing Cooperatives\u000a      (AMCOs) to borrow over US$50 million per season from commercial banks to\u000a      finance purchases from members as they build up volumes for sale. The\u000a      receipted nuts are traded through an auction system involving over 30\u000a      exporters and local processors who submit sealed bids for advertised lots.\u000a      The introduction of these two allied systems, WRS and the auction system,\u000a      has contributed to higher producer prices. In the 2007\/08 season, cashew\u000a      farmers in Tanzania obtained average farmgate prices estimated at US$290\u000a      per tonne. By 2011\/12, the minimum price was estimated at US$750 per tonne\u000a      - an increase of over 2.5 times without any corresponding increase in the\u000a      international market price. The improved producer incentives contributed\u000a      to a rise in output from 79,100 tonnes in 2008\/09 to over 158,000 tonnes\u000a      in the 2011\/12 season.\u000a    Coffee\u000a    In Tanzania, WRS has enabled smallholder farmers to directly market\u000a      value-added `clean' coffee rather than unprocessed `parchment' coffee. The\u000a      farmers sell through rural cooperative societies (RCS) which aggregate on\u000a      behalf of members using inventory finance from banks. It is estimated that\u000a      over US$12 million commercial bank financing is provided per season for\u000a      the coffee trade. The coffee is deposited with curing factories licensed\u000a      by the Tanzania Warehouse Licensing Board. Launched in the early 2000s,\u000a      this system enables over 4,000 smallholder coffee farmers to sell through\u000a      RCSs. Usually, they receive an initial payment which is about 60% of the\u000a      farmgate price offered by private traders for parchment. Subsequent\u000a      payments, received in two tranches, bring the total to almost 170% of the\u000a      parchment price. Increased competition at farmgate level has also\u000a      reportedly benefitted non-participating farmers.\u000a    Cotton\u000a    The WRS pilot for cotton has taken off in Eastern Tanzania, where\u000a      ginners, who traditionally bought the raw seed cotton, processed it into\u000a      lint and cotton seed and then sold them, are willing to provide\u000a      toll-ginning services: farmers' organisations pay a fee for ginning and\u000a      can then sell the processed products themselves. The organisations use\u000a      inventory finance to make initial payments to farmers while they wait for\u000a      processing. Participating farmers obtain net incremental income of over\u000a      50% above the price for seed cotton. In one community, the farmers'\u000a      organisation used part of the profits to finance procurement of inputs and\u000a      tractor services, leading to a ten-fold increase in profits for members.\u000a      Ginners in Western Tanzania are increasingly interested in replicating the\u000a      model. WRS has not had much impact on the market in unprocessed cotton as\u000a      yet.\u000a    Grain\u000a    Even in countries such as Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya and Zambia, where export\u000a      bans and other government interventions in output markets make it\u000a      difficult for depositors to sell their produce for the best possible\u000a      prices, there is evidence that private sector representative\u000a      organisations, e.g. the Ghana Grain Council and the Grain Traders'\u000a      Association of Zambia, continue to advocate the NRI- promoted WRS model.\u000a      Furthermore, in countries where commodity exchanges were incorporated in\u000a      advance of reliable delivery systems, the exchanges are increasingly\u000a      reverting to the NRI WRS model where the receipt assures delivery against\u000a      traded contracts. This is the case in Zambia, where government and the\u000a      Zambia Agricultural Commodity Exchange are in dialogue over a regulatory\u000a      system that will foster WRS. The Ethiopia Commodity Exchange is also\u000a      promoting WRS for \"non-mandated\" crops such as grains to encourage their\u000a      trading on the exchange floor.\u000a    Impact on policy and strategy for developing efficient output markets\u000a    Following declarations by African Union high-level meetings and other\u000a      regional fora in 2005-2006 on the need to promote new market institutions,\u000a      African governments have incorporated WRS into agricultural policies. The\u000a      Kenyan government initiated a WRS to improve trade in maize and other\u000a      staple grains in 2010. In Tanzania, the government and private\u000a      stakeholders are working to strengthen the WRS to ensure a sound\u000a      foundation for a viable commodity exchange. Similar programmes have been\u000a      initiated by the governments of Nigeria and Uganda to turn around the poor\u000a      performance of their commodity exchanges.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Natural Resources Institute (NRI) of the University of Greenwich has,\u000a      since the early 1990s, played a lead role in researching, developing and\u000a      piloting a sustainable and transferable warehouse receipt system (WRS)\u000a      that is accessible to smallholder farmers in Africa.

Smallholder farmers and small-scale\u000a      traders have very limited access to finance. Consequently, smallholder\u000a      farmers are often compelled by household liquidity constraints to sell the\u000a      bulk of their produce at harvest when prices are low. This squeezes\u000a      producer margins and reduces incentives to adopt technology which can\u000a      increase farm productivity and output.\u000a    Availability of inventory finance (loans made using agricultural\u000a      commodities stored in third-party warehouses as collateral) can help\u000a      address some of these challenges. However, in the 1990s the most common\u000a      inventory finance systems in Africa had major limitations. Commercial\u000a      providers of inventory finance required the underlying stocks to be\u000a      managed by reputable international inspection companies who charged high\u000a      fees: affordable by only large-scale enterprises, engaged predominantly in\u000a      import\/export trade. Domestic trade in agricultural commodities hardly\u000a      benefited. Furthermore, the receipts issued did not represent transferable\u000a      title to the stored commodities, so it was not possible to use them in\u000a      trade conducted between parties who had no personal contact. On the other\u000a      hand, NGOs like Technoserve promoted inventory credit systems which\u000a      exclusively targeted smallholder farmers. They typically provided\u000a      intensive supervision as well as loan guarantees (sometimes as high as\u000a      100% of the credit advanced to farmers). However, the lack of economies of\u000a      scale and high oversight costs associated with this system limited efforts\u000a      to scale up and to achieve sustainability.\u000a    NRI therefore set as its research objective the development of a\u000a      sustainable warehouse receipt system (WRS) that is accessible to\u000a      smallholder farmers. The aim was to develop a WRS which improves access to\u000a      inventory finance but also facilitates trade because the receipt\u000a      represents transferable title to the stored commodity. Such a system had\u000a      to attract commercial finance and larger-scale depositors - farmers,\u000a      processors and exporters - in order to build up breakeven volumes within\u000a      4-5 years, the duration of most donor-funded projects.\u000a    NRI's initial research, funded by DFID, involved a review of WRS models\u000a      in the US, South America, India and Eastern Europe. The most promising\u000a      model was then piloted for maize in Ghana in 1993-1996. The research\u000a      indicated that a regulated, widely-accessible WRS will deliver benefits to\u000a      African farmers by easing access to finance and facilitating more\u000a      efficient trade in agricultural commodities, including by providing a\u000a      solid foundation for a viable commodity exchange. The research and\u000a      subsequent pilots identified the following prerequisites for successful\u000a      WRS:\u000a    a. A network of licensed\/certified warehouse operators who satisfy\u000a      requirements designed to protect the interests of depositors and lenders\u000a      including stipulated minimum capital.\u000a    b. Enforcement of quality standards which minimise risk of deterioration\u000a      of stored commodities during storage and are trade-friendly.\u000a    c. A robust regulatory system consisting of warehouse legislation and a\u000a      trusted regulatory agency.\u000a    d.

NRI's research\u000d\u000a      identified alternative ways of increasing tenure security through\u000d\u000a      registration of collective and group\u000d\u000a      rights, establishment of decentralised land boards, and assistance to land\u000d\u000a      management by\u000d\u000a      customary authorities.

We have worked with these three countries since 2003 to produce the Maputaland\u000d\u000aconservation planning system. For example:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aOur research published in Oryx was used in by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, the\u000d\u000aprovincial conservation agency, as evidence to block inappropriate development. J.M. Harris,\u000d\u000aOffice of the Senior Manager Scientific Service, Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife stated: `we\u000d\u000arelied on University of Kent research ... we have used the published priority area maps to help\u000d\u000aprevent inappropriate development in Maputuland, specifically Eucalyptus tree plantations in\u000d\u000aimportant wetlands, grasslands and corridor linkages. The priority area maps have recently\u000d\u000abeen used to motivate against the development of a new leisure development on the shores of\u000d\u000aLake Sibaya, an internationally important area that forms part of the Isimangaliso Wetland Park\u000d\u000aWorld Heritage Site' (see letter detailed in section 5, point A).\u000d\u000aOur research published in Biological Conservation was the first to identify priority areas in the\u000d\u000awhole of Maputaland, and was used to decide where the corridor between Maputo Special\u000d\u000aReserve in Mozambique and Tembe Elephant Park in South Africa should be declared; our\u000d\u000aresearch ensured this was done in a way that protected important wildlife habitat but avoided\u000d\u000aimportant farmlands in the development of the corridor. This led to the creation of a\u000d\u000atransfrontier PA in 2011 which has an area of 24,770 hectares and connects a previously\u000d\u000afragmented elephant population. Connecting elephant populations allows them to move\u000d\u000athrough the landscape, widening the area available to find food and water; it also increases\u000d\u000aopportunities to mate with more geographically distant populations, thus widening genetic\u000d\u000adiversity. Connecting the elephant populations also allows for greater conservation of the\u000d\u000aimportant wetland and sand forest habitats that the elephants travel through (see section 5,\u000d\u000apoint B). Afonso Madope, Ministry of Tourism in Mozambique, states that the research ` played\u000d\u000aa key role in guiding the development of the Futi Corridor conservation area concept' (letter\u000d\u000adetailed in section 5, point B; see also section 5, point A).\u000d\u000aOur research published in Biological Conservation has also been used since 2008 by\u000d\u000aEzemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife as part of their Environmental Impact Assessment process to\u000d\u000aidentify when proposed developments would have serious negative impacts on biodiversity.\u000d\u000aJ.M. Harris, Office of the Senior Manager Scientific Service, Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife\u000d\u000astated: `published priority area maps were incorporated into the National Protected Areas\u000d\u000aExpansion Strategy and helped guide Transfrontier Conservation Area planning ... we have\u000d\u000aused the published priority area maps to help prevent inappropriate development in\u000d\u000aMaputaland' (see letter detailed in section 5, point A).\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a(ii) Informing and defining the prioritisation process for the Critical Ecosystem Partnership\u000d\u000aFund (CEPF) (section 5, point C)\u000d\u000aThe CEPF is a joint program of the French and Japanese Governments, Conservation\u000d\u000aInternational, the Global Environment Facility, the MacArthur Foundation, and the World Bank. It\u000d\u000afunds conservation partners in biodiversity hotspots and will spend US$6.5 million in the\u000d\u000aMaputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot between 2010 and 2015. These projects focus on\u000d\u000aimproving conservation management and implementing new conservation approaches on private\u000d\u000and communal protected areas. Dan Rothberg, CEPF, states: `the University's work helped us to\u000d\u000aidentify and define three of the priority sites ... the team placed a high value on the University of\u000d\u000aKent's contribution'.\u000d\u000aThe CEPF produced an Ecosystem Profile in 2009 to identify priority areas within the hotspot, with\u000d\u000aKent as the only international partner involved in this process. Our work was the basis for the\u000d\u000aprioritisation process in Maputaland and so 3 of the 22 priority areas in the hotspot were identified\u000d\u000afrom the analysis published in Biological Conservation. The impact of this was that US$6.5 million\u000d\u000afrom the CEPF was spent in those 22 priority areas rather than elsewhere. This is detailed in CEPF\u000d\u000a(2010) Ecosystem Profile: Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot (Conservation International\u000d\u000aSouthern African Hotspots Programme and South African National Biodiversity Institute, Cape\u000d\u000aTown, South Africa) available at:\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.cepf.net\/Documents\/DC_Finaldraft_MPAHprofile_Feb262010.pdf\u000d\u000a(iii) Changing global conservation planning practice (section 5, points A, B, E)\u000d\u000aOur research in Maputaland has underpinned conservation planning research projects in a number\u000d\u000aof other countries. Since 2007 we have been working with the Government of Mozambique and\u000d\u000aEduardo Mondlane University on a project to develop new techniques to modify the Zinave and\u000d\u000aBanhine National Parks, and develop a management zoning plan for the Chimanimani National\u000d\u000aPark. Afonso Madope, Ministry of Tourism in Mozambique, states that the research `guided the\u000d\u000azoning ... and boundary changing' of these three PAs (letter detailed in section 5, point B).\u000d\u000aIn 2010, Smith's team received funding from the Global Environment Facility for research to apply\u000d\u000athis approach to West Africa on a project that seeks to mitigate the impacts of climate change on\u000d\u000aPAs in the region. In 2013 we used the software and systems we developed in Maputaland to work\u000d\u000awith the Government of Guyana to identify priority areas for conservation in their country, and to\u000d\u000awork with the Governments of Malaysia and Indonesia to investigate the impacts of climate change\u000d\u000aand land transformation on priority areas for mammal conservation in Borneo.\u000d\u000aOur research on making systematic conservation planning more relevant for practitioners has also\u000d\u000aled to the development of the CLUZ (Conservation Land-use Zoning) project. CLUZ is a GIS\u000d\u000ainterface that allows users to design protected area networks and conservation landscapes. It was\u000d\u000adeveloped by Smith and funded by the British Government through their Darwin Initiative for the\u000d\u000aSurvival of Species. This software and training manual has been downloaded by 1181 people from\u000d\u000a103 countries since it was launched in 2004. CLUZ now has 27 citations in Google Scholar by\u000d\u000aacademics, government and practitioners. These citations include reports describing implementation\u000d\u000aprojects in Brazil, Canada, Reunion, South Africa, USA and Vietnam (section 5, point E).\u000d\u000a(iv) Changing global conservation planning policy\u000d\u000aOur critique in BioScience of the Key Biodiversity Areas approach was widely read and began a\u000d\u000adialogue with BirdLife International, Conservation International and the International Union for\u000d\u000aConservation of Nature (IUCN). IUCN is an organisation made up of more than 12,000 member\u000d\u000aorganisations, including 200 governments and 900 NGOs, and it has committed since 2012 to\u000d\u000aproduce a revised version of the KBA approach that will become a standard part of the Red List\u000d\u000aspecies conservation assessment. The team led by Smith is involved in an on-going research\u000d\u000aproject to improve the scientific defensibility of the KBA approach, which is being led by IUCN's\u000d\u000aWorld Commission on Protected Areas &#8212; Species Survival Commission Joint Task Force on Bio-diversity\u000d\u000aand Protected Areas.\u000d\u000aOur research in BioScience has therefore played a large role in shaping the KBA approach and\u000d\u000adeveloping a system that will help conserve threatened species throughout the world. These future\u000d\u000aimpacts of the research are evidence of the sustained reach and significance of the research in the\u000d\u000alonger term. In a letter from IUCN, research by the University of Kent is credited with `influencing\u000d\u000aand changing planning practices in real world conservation ... Dr Smiths work serves as a model\u000d\u000afor how such constructive interaction can change the relationship between theory and practice'\u000d\u000a(section 5, point D).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aWork by Dr Robert Smith continues to be used by government agencies in Mozambique and South\u000d\u000aAfrica, has already guided the development of Protected Areas (PAs) with a combined area of\u000d\u000a25,000 hectares, and has been used by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund to identify spatial\u000d\u000apriorities for their US$6.5 million funding programme. The team's research has had an obvious,\u000d\u000adirect and significant environmental impact in those regions. It has also had a broader global\u000d\u000aimpact, including shaping the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) revised\u000d\u000aKey Biodiversity Area approach and developing software and training materials for conservation\u000d\u000apractitioners working in 103 countries.

However, there is\u000d\u000astill a mismatch between these approaches and those adopted by some conservation practitioners,\u000d\u000awhich limits the effectiveness of work on the ground. The underpinning research for this impact\u000d\u000acase study, led by Dr Robert Smith at University of Kent (employed 2003 to present) sought to\u000d\u000aaddress these problems. The research was supported by funding from the World Bank, Darwin\u000d\u000aInitiative and Russell E. Train Education for Nature Program\/the African Wildlife Foundation\/Ministry\u000d\u000aof Science, Mozambique, totalling just over &#163;207,000 (full details in section 3, points a, b,\u000d\u000ac). Smith worked in partnership with non-academic user communities in South Africa, Swaziland\u000d\u000aand Mozambique to identify priorities for conservation in those countries, and collaborated with\u000d\u000aacademics and practitioners from international conservation NGOs to develop a new approach for\u000d\u000aidentifying conservation priorities at a global scale. The contribution of the University of Kent was\u000d\u000atherefore significant. The underpinning research was published together with academics and staff\u000d\u000afrom government conservation agencies and focused on the following areas:\u000d\u000a(i) Addressing misconceptions about the systematic conservation planning approach: Smith\u000d\u000awas the lead researcher for an article in Oryx&#8212;The International Journal of Conservation which\u000d\u000aidentified five factors in systematic conservation planning that were perceived by practitioners to be\u000d\u000alimitations. These perceived limitations include, for example, difficulties in using planning software;\u000d\u000athe costs of systematic conservation planning; and its extensive data requirements. Smith et al.\u000d\u000ademonstrated how these perceptions are generally misplaced, and illustrated the value of\u000d\u000asystematic conservation planning to practitioners using a case study that describes a low-cost\u000d\u000aexercise from Maputaland, South Africa.\u000d\u000a(ii) Including implementation-relevant data in systematic conservation planning: Innovative\u000d\u000aresearch on transnational conservation planning work in Southern Africa, led by Smith and\u000d\u000apublished in the journal Biological Conservation, was the first to incorporate biodiversity, socio-economic\u000d\u000aand implementation data to provide policy-relevant guidance. The research involved producing\u000d\u000adistribution data on important species and habitat types, modelling the risk of agricultural transformation\u000d\u000aas a surrogate for farming opportunity cost, and modelling potential revenue from wildlife\u000d\u000aranching, an important local industry. The data were then combined to identify priority conservation\u000d\u000aareas that met biodiversity targets whilst minimising negative impacts on local livelihoods.\u000d\u000a(iii) Critiquing the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) approach: The KBA approach was developed\u000d\u000aby several international conservation NGOs and advocated as the best system for identifying\u000d\u000aglobally important conservation areas. Together with colleagues from South Africa, the USA and\u000d\u000aAustralia, Smith published an article in the journal BioScience showing the KBA system was flawed\u000d\u000abecause it: (a) failed to account for social, political and socio-economic factors that are important\u000d\u000afor implementation, and (b) selected priority sites on a case-by-case basis, rather than using much\u000d\u000amore efficient techniques that identify networks of complementary priority areas. Instead, the article\u000d\u000aargued the KBA approach should be modified to focus on irreplaceable areas for only the most\u000d\u000athreatened species, and that the systematic conservation planning approach should underpin all\u000d\u000apriority setting systems..\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"4587","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    COMPAS's research has had significant impact on UK policy development,\u000a      and shaped and informed international debates on both labour demand and\u000a      trafficking and forced labour. It has also influenced the training of and\u000a      the advice provided to NGOs and practitioners who are key players in\u000a      policy formation, thereby furthering the influence of the research on\u000a      immigration policy. Below are some instances of the impact of this\u000a      research within these three areas.\u000a    UK government policy\u000a    Anderson and Ruhs' expertise on migration and low-waged labour markets\u000a      has led to close engagement with government at all stages of the policy\u000a      cycle. Their research on demand for labour in six high-usage sectors was\u000a      commissioned by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) in March 2008.[Section\u000a        5: C1] The MAC is a group of economists established to advise the\u000a      government on labour and immigration policy. Its first report, analysing\u000a      the UK's skilled labour market, addressed the question `Is it \"sensible\"\u000a      to fill a shortage with migrants?' and in this chapter acknowledged: \"We\u000a      draw heavily on Anderson and Ruhs (2008) [R1].\"[C1] The\u000a      report was later published by OUP as the edited volume Who Needs\u000a        Migrant Workers? and described by Professor David Metcalf, the Chair\u000a      of the Migration Advisory Committee, as \"the definitive research on the\u000a      demand for migrant workers... [it] will inform the debate for years to\u000a      come.\"[C2]\u000a    In the same year the controversy surrounding government policy resulted\u000a      in the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs Inquiry into\u000a      the Economic Impact of Immigration. Ruhs served as its specialist adviser\u000a      and was responsible for the first draft of its report. Anderson provided\u000a      oral and written evidence during the Inquiry. Her evidence and her\u000a      research on demand for migrant domestic labour [R3] was cited in\u000a      the final report of the Inquiry.[C3]\u000a    Anderson's particular interest in demand for migrant domestic workers and\u000a      its relation to trafficking and forced labour [R4] led to an\u000a      invitation to give evidence to the Equality and Human Rights Commission's\u000a      (EHRC) Inquiry into Trafficking in Scotland by the investigating\u000a      commissioner, Baroness Helena Kennedy QC.\u000a    The research findings on the conflict between older care users and\u000a      migrant workers were taken up by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.\u000a      Spencer had been a Commissioner at the precursor body of the EHRC, the\u000a      Commission for Racial Equality (2002-2006). An EHRC Commissioner was the\u000a      key speaker at the launch of the research report [R2] and this led\u000a      to a seminar organized by the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u000a      involving the Care Quality Commission to discuss how to respond to the\u000a      discrimination and harassment faced by care workers. Evidence from the\u000a      report was cited in recent responses to a Home Office consultation on\u000a      workplace `third-party harassment' by those arguing that a legal provision\u000a      protecting staff from harassment should not be repealed,[C4] and\u000a      the report was cited in the Government's summary of consultation\u000a      responses.[C5] Spencer then met with the Department of Health\u000a      Director of Workforce Development to discuss the broader findings. He\u000a      acknowledged that \"the points raised are extremely helpful\" and agreed to\u000a      ensure \"that these are fed directly to the White Paper team.\"[C6]\u000a    International debate\u000a    In 2005 the Annual Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on trafficking\u000a      cited Anderson and O'Connell Davidson [R4] extensively. As a\u000a      direct result of this influence on the international debate, Anderson's\u000a      later work on trafficking and forced labour,[R5] and her writing on\u000a      precarious labour and migration [R6] have been used to frame\u000a      policies and debate at an international level by the Organization for\u000a      Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). For example, her contribution\u000a      to the OSCE high-level dialogue in 2010 was clearly reflected in\u000a      recommendations 1, 5, 7, 8, 15 and 20.[C7] She has addressed their\u000a      annual alliance meeting for the prevention of trafficking on two occasions\u000a      (2010 and 2012). These meetings are attended by c. 60 ambassadors and\u000a      their advisers as well as by organizations such as the United Nations\u000a      Development Programme (UNDP), International Labour Organization (ILO), and\u000a      others. Access to these ambassadors is critical in conveying analysis to a\u000a      broad international audience. At a more specific level, following the 2010\u000a      meeting, OSCE initiated training courses for diplomatic staff on best\u000a      practice in the employment of domestic workers in embassies.\u000a    Research by Anderson and Ruhs [R1] has also informed training and\u000a      development courses, including one held in conjunction with the ILO, for\u000a      the Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) officials on labour\u000a      demand and trafficking (2013). The four-nation comparative report of the\u000a      Migrant Care Worker study [C8] was published by an\u000a      intergovernmental body, the International Organization on Migration (IOM),\u000a      and was the subject of an IOM seminar in Geneva to discuss its\u000a      implications.\u000a    NGOs and civil society\u000a    In 1987 Anderson was instrumental in establishing the domestic workers'\u000a      charity, Kalayaan.

There was a shift to\u000a      evidence-based policymaking coupled with considerable lobbying by a wide\u000a      range of interested actors. This gave rise to a growing concern about\u000a      migration and forced labour. In general, legal migration channels\u000a      prioritized particular labour market sectors and highly skilled workers.\u000a      The UK was unusual in not adopting transitional measures to limit the\u000a      migration of nationals of new EU member states with EU Enlargement in\u000a      2004. The human rights consequences of greater mobility were mainly\u000a      managed through anti-trafficking policies.\u000a    In this context, COMPAS's research addressed the tension between labour\u000a      market flexibilities and rights. The team examined the structures of key\u000a      sectors with strong demand for migrant labour (particularly care work and\u000a      domestic labour) and addressed the dynamics of `irregular' or `illegal'\u000a      flows of people into the UK. COMPAS research pioneered an understanding of\u000a      key labour markets, clarified comprehension of migrant `irregularity', and\u000a      developed a synthesis of quantitative economic analysis with ethnographic\u000a      and qualitatively informed research, thereby initiating new\u000a      interdisciplinary perspectives in a key area of policy formation both\u000a      within the UK and across the globe.\u000a    Labour immigration is often regarded simplistically as a single issue.\u000a      COMPAS's research on demand for low-waged migrant labour, particularly the\u000a      demand for domestic and care work, has led to a close examination of how\u000a      broader public policies relate to (1) demand for (migrant) labour and (2)\u000a      trafficking and forced labour.\u000a    Key researchers within the team at Oxford include:\u000a    \u000a      Professor Bridget Anderson (project lead): 2003-present, Deputy\u000a        Director, COMPAS\u000a      Dr Martin Ruhs: 2003-2012, Chief Economist, COMPAS\u000a      Dr Sarah Spencer: 2003-present, Senior Fellow, COMPAS\u000a      Dr Isabel Shutes: 2008-2011, Researcher, COMPAS\u000a      Dr Alessio Cangiano: 2008-2011, Researcher, COMPAS\u000a    \u000a    1) Demand for (migrant) labour: COMPAS researchers were the first\u000a      to investigate demand for migrant labour, immigration status, and the\u000a      impact of what was, in effect, an immigration amnesty during European\u000a      Enlargement in 2004. Anderson, Ruhs, Spencer (whose research focused on\u000a      the demand in construction, private households, hospitality, and\u000a      agriculture), and Rogaly (University of Sussex, whose research focused on\u000a      demand in the agricultural sector) conducted research on the consequences\u000a      of the change of status when migrants from EU new-member states became EU\u000a      citizens. They interviewed migrants, employers, and employment agencies in\u000a      four sectors. One of the key findings from the `Changing Status, Changing\u000a      Lives?' project, conducted in the UK 2004-2006, was the crucial role that\u000a      immigration status plays in creating a labour force that is attractive to\u000a      employers. Investigating demand requires an approach that analyses this in\u000a      conjunction with a broad range of public policies and social contexts\u000a      including demographic change, feminization of labour markets, housing\u000a      policy, and labour market deregulation. Anderson and Ruhs developed this\u000a      for research they undertook for the Migration Advisory Committee on demand\u000a      for migrant labour across different migrant high-use sectors.[See\u000a        Section 3: R1] Cangiano, Shutes, and Spencer examined the demand for\u000a      care work in the context of an ageing population. They found that reform\u000a      in the social care and immigration systems must proceed in parallel and\u000a      that, in practice, migrants will continue to be crucial in care provision\u000a      into the future.[R2] It was the first UK research to highlight the\u000a      conflict of rights between migrant workers and vulnerable older service\u000a      users.\u000a    2) Trafficking and forced labour: Anderson looked at how migration\u000a      shapes the nature of the demand for migrant domestic workers and its\u000a      relation to trafficking.[R3] She has also worked more generally on\u000a      the relation between trafficking, forced labour, and immigration in the\u000a      UK. In 2003 Anderson undertook research with O'Connell Davidson\u000a      (Nottingham), with Anderson focusing particularly on demand for domestic\u000a      labour and O'Connell Davidson on the demand for sexual labour. The\u000a      research was conducted in India, Sweden, Thailand, the UK, and Italy. It\u000a      found, first, that ideas of `consent' and `exploitation' are extremely\u000a      difficult to operationalize, and that these need to be seen as working on\u000a      a continuum rather than a simple binary; and second, that there was not a\u000a      demand per se for `trafficked' people, but rather for workers who\u000a      were cheaper and more dependent.[R4] This was extended into a\u000a      project on demand for sex and domestic labour more generally in the UK and\u000a      Spain. It also developed into research conducted for the TUC on migration\u000a      and forced labour in a number of sectors in the UK. Anderson and Rogaly\u000a      found that migrants with legal status as well as those working illegally\u000a      were vulnerable to highly exploitative living and working conditions.[R5]\u000a      De-regulation and chains of sub-contracting were particularly important in\u000a      producing susceptibility to poor conditions.[R6]\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4588","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research cited above has had impact in two distinct ways: (1) directly\u000a        informing the migration debate, changing its terms and providing the\u000a      information needed to make evidence-based arguments in the policy arena;\u000a      (2) changing the practices of parliamentarians and other participants\u000a        in the migration debate, including journalists who influence public\u000a        opinion, thanks to the credibility of Ruhs' research, which enabled\u000a      the establishment of the Migration Observatory.\u000a    1) Directly informing the debate\u000a    a) Public opinion on immigration in Britain. Blinder's research on\u000a      public attitudes changed the terms of the debate over student migration,\u000a      and in the process contributed to a decision to change the reporting of\u000a      immigration statistics. These findings have introduced an important\u000a      addition to the evidence base regarding policies and data on international\u000a      students. The Chief Executive of Universities UK (UUK) cited the research\u000a      in two contexts. First, it was used in evidence to the House of Commons\u000a      Select Committee on Business, Innovation and Skills.[C1] Based on\u000a      this evidence, the Committee recommended removing international students\u000a      from the government's migration target. Within days of the hearing the\u000a      government agreed to provide immigration statistics disaggregated into\u000a      students and non-students.[C2] In addition, the Chief Executive of\u000a      UUK cited the research in the media to rebut claims about attitudes toward\u000a      student immigration that came from a poll conducted by a pressure group.[C3]\u000a    This impact occurred prior to publication of the relevant journal article\u000a      [R1] because the findings were disseminated in a report (`Thinking\u000a      Behind the Numbers') published on the Migration Observatory website in\u000a      October 2011. The report reached a large audience, receiving extensive\u000a      media coverage including BBC News, the Daily Mail, Sunday\u000a        Telegraph, and the Independent, and was cited directly by\u000a      Vince Cable (Minister, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) in\u000a      a speech in December 2011.[C4]\u000a    b) Remittances. Vargas-Silva's research on migrants' remittances\u000a      had a direct input to internal debate within the Office of National\u000a      Statistics on methodologies for measuring remittances. Vargas-Silva's\u000a      research was used in internal ONS discussions to develop the first\u000a      official measures of remittances for the UK. The study of remittance flows\u000a      between the UK and Bangladesh and Pakistan [R2,R3] provided the\u000a      basis for Vargas-Silva's briefing paper for the Migration Observatory (Aug\u000a      2011), prior to the appearance of the scholarly articles above. Thus, the\u000a      Migration Observatory acted as the vehicle for impact. An official in the\u000a      Trade and Transfers team in the Business Indicators and Balance of\u000a      Payments section of the ONS, who was charged with updating the UK's\u000a      international reporting of balance of payments data, read this briefing\u000a      and contacted Vargas-Silva directly by email and in person to discuss\u000a      options for measuring remittances. The detailed explanations of the\u000a      methods for measuring remittances and the discussion of their relative\u000a      strengths and weaknesses, provided by Vargas-Silva's research [R2, R3],\u000a      better informed the ONS. The current ONS official leading this project has\u000a      testified that Vargas-Silva's research was quoted at a key internal ONS\u000a      meeting of a methods committee, and was useful in shaping ONS\u000a      deliberations. Vargas-Silva's discussion of the weaknesses of existing\u000a      measures ultimately informed ONS's decision that present data do not offer\u000a      an adequate method for measuring UK remittances.[C5] As a result,\u000a      the ONS rejected the idea that it should simply adopt existing\u000a      international measures of remittances, at least until better data and\u000a      methods are available.\u000a    2) Changing practices in how migration is debated and reported to the\u000a        public\u000a    Ruhs' research on labour markets and migration [R4,R5,R6] was\u000a      critical in establishing the intellectual credibility and independence of\u000a      the Migration Observatory, which has in turn changed practices for many\u000a      participants and observers of the migration policy debate, in the\u000a      following ways.\u000a    First, previously, parliamentarians, civil servants, NGOs, and\u000a      journalists had relied on organizations such as IPPR (Institute for Public\u000a      Policy Research) and Migration Watch for data and analysis on migration,\u000a      yet these organizations have clearly stated political agendas and are thus\u000a      less impartial. The Observatory has changed practices in a variety of ways\u000a      among these stakeholders by introducing an accessible and impartial source\u000a      of data that can be used to increase the evidentiary basis of policy\u000a      debates and media coverage. For example, MPs from three different parties\u000a      cited Observatory research in debate in the House of Commons;[C6]\u000a      in this instance, Migration Observatory analysis provided an evidence base\u000a      for discussing proposals to limit to the UK's population below 70 million,\u000a      as two MPs cited the report during the debate (one Conservative, one SNP),\u000a      while a third MP (Labour) cited many of its key findings, including the\u000a      Observatory's recognizable term the net migration `bounce', referring to\u000a      reductions in emigration that follow from earlier reductions in\u000a      immigration.[C6, cols 447-448] In another instance, the House of\u000a      Commons Public Administration Select Committee made recommendations for\u000a      improved collection and public communication of migration statistics,\u000a      drawing on written evidence from the Observatory and oral testimony by\u000a      Blinder.[C7] Journalists use Observatory work extensively. As one\u000a      journalist put it, \"Before (the Migration Observatory) I'd use Migration\u000a      Watch quite a lot. I think of them as credible but they are partial, so\u000a      while I still use them, I now use them more for quotes than for\u000a      information.\"[C8] Observatory work also has allowed journalists to\u000a      write about new aspects of the migration issue where they previously\u000a      lacked access to data or analysis.[C9]\u000a    This impact extends beyond reporting on migration. Civil society\u000a      organizations have also benefited from the Migration Observatory, which\u000a      offers impartial evidence that they can use to support their arguments.[C10]\u000a      The creation of the Observatory as a reliable source has also changed\u000a      parliamentarians' practices, making elements of the migration debate\u000a      better grounded in reliable evidence, as testified in the Observer\u000a      editorial of 2 Sept 2012.[C11]\u000a    These impacts are directly linked to Ruhs' research, which was essential\u000a      for establishing the Observatory as a reliable, credible, and non-partisan\u000a      source of public information. First, the Observatory is widely trusted\u000a      because it is rooted in Oxford University research, particularly that\u000a      undertaken by Ruhs prior to 2011.[R4-R6] Second, Ruhs' research on\u000a      labour markets led him to prominent roles that bestowed public trust for\u000a      political impartiality. As a direct result of his research, he became\u000a      Specialist Advisor to the House of Lords Inquiry into the economic impacts\u000a      of migration to Britain (2008) and member of the Migration Advisory\u000a      Committee, the politically neutral body that advises the government on\u000a      migration data and policy (2007-present). These roles have helped his\u000a      research and the Migration Observatory to gain credibility and prominence\u000a      within UK policymaking circles.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out at the University of Oxford's Centre on Migration\u000a      Policy and Society (COMPAS) and disseminated through an accessible\u000a      multimedia website, `The Migration Observatory', has transformed public\u000a      and policy debate on migration and changed the practices of government\u000a      departments, media, and third-sector organizations regarding migration\u000a      data. As a result of COMPAS's research on public attitudes to immigration,\u000a      migrants' remittance payments, and employers' demand for migrant labour,\u000a      these groups have been able to make stronger, evidence-based arguments and\u000a      decisions.\u000a    The impact has occurred in two main ways: (1) direct impact on public\u000a      debates; and (2) changes in the practices of those participating in, or\u000a      reporting on, those debates. The direct impact has included evidence for\u000a      arguments against new restrictions on student immigration, and related\u000a      arguments in favour of changing the way student immigration statistics are\u000a      tracked. It has also included shaping deliberations on the potential for\u000a      developing new measures of remittances by the Office of National\u000a      Statistics. Changes in practice have involved the dissemination of\u000a      research and data through the vehicle of the Migration Observatory.

Three\u000a      key lines of research underpin the impact reported: Blinder's research on\u000a      public attitudes towards immigration; Vargas-Silva's research on\u000a      remittances; and Ruhs' work (including work with Anderson) on employers'\u000a      demand for migrant labour. All of these were disseminated through the\u000a      Migration Observatory website, and the existence of these research\u000a      findings was essential to the initial creation of the Observatory.\u000a    The majority of the British public express preferences for reduced levels\u000a      of immigration to Britain, when asked. Yet immigration is heterogeneous,\u000a      leaving an open question about what types of immigrants public opinion\u000a      would like to see reduced. Blinder's research found that most respondents\u000a      thought of asylum seekers and labour migrants in surveys, while\u000a      surprisingly, only a small minority thought of international students,\u000a      despite the fact that students comprised the largest of the four main\u000a      channels of immigration to Britain in the last few years. Thus, the\u000a      research shows a mismatch between immigration as imagined by members of\u000a      the public and immigration as counted in government statistics and\u000a      targeted in government policies. This has become a key data point in\u000a      arguments against limitations on student immigration and for removing\u000a      students from the net migration target or net migration statistics.[Section\u000a        3: R1]\u000a    Vargas-Silva's research (with Isaacs and Hugo, Developing Markets\u000a      Associates Limited, DMA; and with Jha and Sugiyarto, Asian Development\u000a      Bank, ADB) examined remittances, or transfers of money, from residents of\u000a      one country to residents of another country, often involving migrants\u000a      sending money to families and communities in their home country.[R2,R3]\u000a      In all cases Vargas- Silva was the sole academic member of the research\u000a      teams and collaborated with private sector organizations (i.e. DMA) and\u000a      multilateral organizations (i.e. ADB). Vargas-Silva provided the technical\u000a      and academic background for the studies, while the other members provided\u000a      complementary insights from private and policy-sector perspectives. By\u000a      many measures, remittances represent a larger flow of money to many\u000a      developing countries than international aid from governments.\u000a      Vargas-Silva's research compares how remittances are measured in other\u000a      countries and by international organizations and provides comparative data\u000a      on existing remittance estimates for transfer to and from the UK. Further,\u000a      the research includes explanations of changes in remittances to the UK\u000a      over time and detailed examination of remittances from the UK to\u000a      Bangladesh and Pakistan, finding that the UK accounted for &#163;626 million in\u000a      remittances to Bangladesh and &#163;1,228 million in remittances to Pakistan in\u000a      the fiscal year 2012-2013.\u000a    Ruhs led a research programme (including articles written with Anderson\u000a      and with Phil Martin of UC-Davis but culminating in a single-authored\u000a      book) that has shown that immigration levels &#8212; particularly in labour\u000a      migration - are not determined by immigration policy alone; levels of\u000a      immigration are also determined by labour market demand and by related\u000a      policies toward migrants' rights.[R4,R5,R6] A key example is the\u000a      comparison between Britain and Sweden. Both countries (along with Ireland\u000a      but unlike the rest of the EU) opened their labour markets to `A8'\u000a      migrants (nationals of the eight countries that joined the EU in 2004). By\u000a      2006, hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans had come to work in\u000a      Britain, while only about 5,000 found jobs in Sweden in the same period.\u000a      Ruhs and Martin argue that Sweden's tightly regulated labour market, which\u000a      guarantees collectively bargained wages and rights to all workers in a\u000a      given industry, was critical in reducing incentives for employers to hire\u000a      migrants.[R5] Ruhs developed this argument into a book- length\u000a      comparative empirical project showing trade-offs between openness to\u000a      migrants and the rights accorded to migrants once they have arrived.[R6]\u000a    Note that Ruhs' broader work is also the subject of a case study\u000a      for the Social Policy panel (UOA22), but in this case study the focus is\u000a      on a distinct set of impacts through the vehicle of the Migration\u000a      Observatory. \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4589","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe team's research had considerable impact on UK migration policy, thanks to COMPAS's core\u000d\u000aaim to engage with policymakers and contribute to government policy development in this arena. In\u000d\u000aparticular, COMPAS's early research had a direct influence on the thinking of the Commission on\u000d\u000aIntegration and Cohesion (set up in response to the London bombings in July 2005 and where\u000d\u000aKeith was principal academic member), whose recommendations were largely adopted by the\u000d\u000aBrown government in its 2008 reform of UK integration policy. Against this backdrop, since 2008,\u000d\u000aCOMPAS's research in this area has had a significant impact in three key areas:\u000d\u000a4.1) `Superdiversity': Contributing a new framework for UK migration policy\u000d\u000aVertovec's research on `superdiversity' [R1,R2] is cited explicitly by the Commission on Integration\u000d\u000aand Cohesion and informed the government response to the report. [Section 5: C1] Both Ruth\u000d\u000aKelly and Hazel Blears (successive Secretaries of State at the Department of Communities and\u000d\u000aLocal Government) stressed the importance of the report's analytical frame-work in establishing\u000d\u000athe Migration Impact Forum and the Migration Advisory Committee. [C2]\u000d\u000aThe `superdiversity' framework became a key component of the drafting of new guidelines for the\u000d\u000amanagement of diversity at local governance level, in establishing new funding streams of central\u000d\u000agovernment support directed at the integration of new migrants, and in the recognition of new\u000d\u000adiversities that incorporated both older models of `race relations' and new associational forms,\u000d\u000asuch as diasporic religious faith and transnational connection. For example, the new principles of\u000d\u000aintegration linked to this research [R3,R4] were adopted by the Housing Corporation (the principal\u000d\u000afunder of social housing subsidy in the UK 1964-2008) when drafting revised principles of\u000d\u000aintegration and cohesion for new-build housing estates. [C3] The Housing Corporation\u000d\u000aimplemented new policies because patterns of `superdiversity' undermined their previous support\u000d\u000afor ethnic-specific social housing provision and cited the work of the Commission as spurring this\u000d\u000achange, and therefore, by association, the research of Vertovec. [C3]\u000d\u000a4.2) Changing integration policy at local and city level in the UK and Europe\u000d\u000aAs mentioned, the Commission on Integration and Cohesion drew heavily on the research of\u000d\u000aVertovec [R1,R2], but also relied on the research of Keith [R3,R4] (as principal academic on the\u000d\u000aCommission) when drafting the principles of a new model of integration and cohesion. [C1] Keith\u000d\u000ahas continued to advise central and local government on cohesion and integration policy. For\u000d\u000aexample, the London Borough of Hackney formulated their cohesion and integration policy in\u000d\u000aresponse to Keith's post-2008 research and supervision of an ESRC CASE studentship held by\u000d\u000aHannah Jones (2007-11) jointly at Goldsmiths and the London Borough of Hackney. Drawing on\u000d\u000athe rethinking of `race relations' and focusing on the need to address new diversities in London,\u000d\u000aKeith's research [R4] was used along with the work of Jones to restructure policies on integration\u000d\u000aof one of London's most diverse boroughs. [C4] This is reflected in the adopted policy of the\u000d\u000acouncil. Keith supported the CASE studentship research of Jones which was used to draft council\u000d\u000apolicy and gave evidence to the relevant council committees that passed the final policy. [C5]\u000d\u000aThe work COMPAS has done with a local government focus has also been recognised at the\u000d\u000aEuropean level. For example, recommendations made by Spencer as part of the CLIP project (on\u000d\u000aequality and diversity in municipal staffing and service provision), [C7] were instrumental to\u000d\u000aEurocities when they were benchmarking good practice for its network of 170 cities across 35\u000d\u000acountries in Europe. [C6] Moreover, in competitive peer-reviewed funding calls COMPAS has been\u000d\u000aawarded over &#163;900,000 in grants from the European Integration Fund programme for projects that\u000d\u000aspecifically translate research knowledge into policy practice on local leadership and migration,\u000d\u000aunderstanding migrant integration outcomes at the neighbourhood level, and on the impact of\u000d\u000arestrictions and entitlements on the integration of migrants. [C8] Several senior European policy\u000d\u000aofficials have offered personal testimony to confirm the impact of this work on European thinking\u000d\u000aand practice in relation to migration integration (e.g. the EU's Deputy Director of Integration). [C9]\u000d\u000a4.3) Recognising the importance of religious faith in formulating integration and antidiscrimination\u000d\u000apolicy\u000d\u000aSpencer's work with Fredman [R8] was explicitly cited by government as informing the revised\u000d\u000adefinition of equality that would underpin the Equality Bill,[C10] enacted in 2010 and implemented\u000d\u000aby the 2010 Coalition government, thereby impacting directly on the formulation of anti-discrimination\u000d\u000alaw in the UK. This research focus was complemented by Gidley's [R6] work on the\u000d\u000aJewish community in contemporary Britain and work on Islamic politics and political participation by\u000d\u000aKeith [R3] and by Jayaweera,[R7] which fed directly into the consideration of migrant rights and\u000d\u000aequalities in processes of integration, as evidenced by the research providing the principal focus\u000d\u000afor the 2013 All Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism's symposium on `Integration,\u000d\u000aDisadvantage and Extremism'. [C11]\u000d\u000aConclusion\u000d\u000aCOMPAS has investigated, described, and disseminated research on the major changes in UK\u000d\u000amigration dynamics over the last decade. It has also revealed the policy options, trade-offs, and\u000d\u000aconsequences of these new patterns through work that engaged directly with policymakers in both\u000d\u000acentral and local government. In articulating the importance of new and multiple diversities that\u000d\u000ahave arisen from these migration trends, the research has been significant in the national policy\u000d\u000arethinking of `race relations' institutions and multicultural policy (4.1 above). In signalling the\u000d\u000aimportance and implications of local differences in diversity (4.2 above) for service delivery,\u000d\u000aresearch has had impact on local government and urban policy-making. Finally, in highlighting the\u000d\u000asignificance of religious faith in patterns of social identity formation (4.3 above), research has\u000d\u000ainfluenced the manner in which religious faith and broader dimensions of diversity nuance the\u000d\u000aunderstanding of equalities policies and also the manner in which policies are put into practice.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aOxford research, based at the ESRC-funded Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS),\u000d\u000aon `superdiversity' and transnationalism has directly influenced the formulation and framing of UK\u000d\u000aand European policy on migration and integration. Through constant interaction with policymakers\u000d\u000aand practitioners, engaged research at COMPAS has enabled the concept of `superdiversity', first\u000d\u000atheorised by Vertovec, to be widely utilised in the consequent formulation of new policies for\u000d\u000amigrant integration and local governance at both central and local levels. In particular, this\u000d\u000aresearch has influenced central government policy on integration and cohesion, and on anti-discrimination\u000d\u000alaw, and local government practice.

Theorisation of these new demographic realities was at\u000d\u000athe core of Vertovec's research on transnationalism and `superdiversity' and Keith's work on\u000d\u000amulticultural urban change.\u000d\u000aVertovec's research highlighted the pluralisation of everyday diversities of migration status,\u000d\u000aethnicity and religious affiliation. His theorisation of `superdiversity' introduced a new conceptual\u000d\u000avocabulary to make sense of these changes. [Section 3: R1,R2] The research argued that, in\u000d\u000acontrast to models of `race relations' between a limited number of clearly defined ethnic minorities,\u000d\u000aBritain was characterised by multiple forms of migrant identity, association, and belonging, that\u000d\u000adeveloped dense, highly localised networks as well as transnational links. [R1] These new forms of\u000d\u000agroup identity were structured by differences of locality, legal status, class, and religious faith.\u000d\u000aPrior to his arrival at COMPAS, Keith's work addressed, at first hand, policy dilemmas of migrant\u000d\u000aintegration. After his arrival at COMPAS, in 2008, Keith's published research argued that the city\u000d\u000awas increasingly a privileged site of both regimes of citizenship and registers of affective\u000d\u000abelonging. [R3,R4] Faith-based social movements in London and new religious identifications\u000d\u000areflected `new' faith-based transnational geopolitical identifications more than `old' ethnic identities\u000d\u000aand needed to be understood in terms of their `glocalised' links between globalised networks and\u000d\u000alocal associations. [R3,R4]\u000d\u000aSpencer led COMPAS's involvement in a European research consortium considering the role of\u000d\u000alocal government in migrant integration (the Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants (CLIP)\u000d\u000aconsortium). Spencer's research has highlighted how dilemmas confronting local governments\u000d\u000acreate problems that must be addressed at the level of municipalities, even when nation-states fail\u000d\u000ato acknowledge the empirical realities of the consequences of growth in migrant numbers. [R5]\u000d\u000aGidley and Jayaweera examined the developing practices of municipal responses to\u000d\u000a`superdiversity' and considered the implications of `superdiversity' to faith. The research recognised\u000d\u000athe growing significance of religious faith in diasporic migrant associations and transnational links\u000d\u000ain processes of integration. [R6,R7] Their research also established that diasporic religious faith\u000d\u000arestructures the cartographies of migrant association; policies of migrant integration need to be\u000d\u000aredesigned in the light of these emergent patterns. [R5,R6,R7] The pluralisation of migrant\u000d\u000aidentities and circumstances privileges localised responses of receiving communities over a `one-\u000d\u000asize-fits-all' national policy. Flexible structures of local governance are often best placed to\u000d\u000aunderstand both the complexity of global networks, and the local processes structuring the\u000d\u000aoutcomes of migration as well as the responses to receiving societies. [R4]. In work commissioned\u000d\u000aby The Joseph Rowntree Foundation to influence changing policy priorities on faith-based\u000d\u000aidentification, Jayaweera's work also considered the implications of `superdiversity' for Islamic\u000d\u000aassociation and the salience of religious faith to migrant integration processes. [R7] while Spencer\u000d\u000a(with Fredman) explored the implications of diversity for reform of equality law.

This, and other Young\u000a      Lives research [R2], was summarised for a policy audience in a\u000a      2013 report by Martin Woodhead, Paul Dornan (Young Lives policy officer)\u000a      and Helen Murray (former Young Lives policy officer) What Inequality\u000a        Means for Children: Evidence from Young Lives. This report was\u000a      submitted to the UNICEF\/UN Women thematic consultation on inequalities for\u000a      the Post-2015 Development Agenda (and ranked fifth out of 180 submissions\u000a      for downloads). A substantial part of Woodhead et al (2013) was\u000a      incorporated into the UNICEF\/UN Women submission to the UN\u000a      Secretary-General's High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015\u000a      Development Agenda [C3, pp 44-6].\u000a    Young Lives analysis of inequalities was further developed in a paper\u000a      based on children's accounts of living in poverty published with Save the\u000a      Children and launched at the UN High-level Panel meeting in Bali [C4].\u000a      Understanding children's perspectives is essential in shaping polices,\u000a      particularly for those seeking to deliver on the post-2015 agenda. Young\u000a      Lives research has been used by UNICEF for their forthcoming contribution\u000a      to the UN Secretary-General's Report on the Girl Child (2013) and\u000a      contributed more broadly to consultations on the post-2015 agenda:\u000a      according to the Director of the UNICEF Office of Research and the UNICEF\u000a      Senior Adviser Post- 2015 Agenda: `Young Lives' analysis directly informed\u000a      the global UN Consultation on Inequalities which was part of the\u000a      consultations for the Post-2015 Development Agenda, showing how multiple\u000a      disadvantages in early life have been undermining children's lives' [C6].\u000a      Save the Children have also incorporated Young Lives analysis into their\u000a      briefing for the IF Hunger Campaign (June 2013) [C5, pp iv, 5, 10,\u000a        17-18].\u000a    Inequality is increasing within all four of the Young Lives study\u000a      countries, and the programme's model of research on poverty and inequality\u000a      has been replicated at country level. According to the Director of the\u000a      UNICEF Office of Research and the UNICEF Senior Adviser Post- 2015 Agenda:\u000a      `Young Lives research ...[provides] important insights for UNICEF\u000a      advocacy, policy and programme design, and...[is] especially valuable at\u000a      national level in the 4 countries...' [C6]. In Peru, effective use\u000a      of communication channels allowed Young Lives findings on inequalities in\u000a      children's cognitive development to feed into the development of Cuna\u000a        M&#225;s, the new early childhood programme. Findings on the Juntos\u000a      conditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme `confirmed the assumptions of our\u000a      technical team on several variables' and fed into improvements developed\u000a      by the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion, according to the\u000a      Executive Director of Juntos [C7]. Furthermore, the\u000a      Director of the Poverty Reduction and Equity Department at the World Bank\u000a      confirmed that `the fact that Young Lives has three rounds of survey\u000a      available, plus comparative data for four countries makes it incredibly\u000a      valuable for the development community ... its current and potential\u000a      impact on policy is each time [therefore] more powerful'. This led the\u000a      Peru office of the World Bank to utilise Young Lives data for a report on\u000a      inequality [C8]. Internationally, Young Lives research\u000a      on inequalities in school systems [R5] is informing DFID's\u000a      programming [C9], Save the Children advocacy [C10, pp 12, 13,\u000a        28-9] and UNESCO monitoring [C11, pp 2, 52, 56, 189].\u000a    Child protection:\u000a    Orphanhood: Young Lives analysis was used as part of the\u000a      consultation on a new policy framework for orphans and other vulnerable\u000a      children in Ethiopia, and formed the basis of a further study which\u000a      challenged the assumption that parental death alone results in poorer\u000a      outcomes for children (Crivello, G, and N Chuta (2012) `Rethinking\u000a      Orphanhood and Vulnerability in Ethiopia'. Development in Practice\u000a      22 (4): 536-48). This work led to the foundation of the first\u000a      child-focused research-to-practice forum in Ethiopia, supported by UNICEF\u000a      and hosted by the Ministry of Women, Children and Youth Affairs.\u000a    Child labour: This research led to an invitation to an\u000a      International Labour Organisation- International Programme on the\u000a      Elimination of Child Labour (ILO-IPEC) meeting in Turin in February 2010\u000a      on hazardous child labour, and information gathered there fed into\u000a      development of further research on children's agricultural work (Morrow,\u000a      V, and U Vennam (2012) `Children's Responses to Risk in Agricultural\u000a      Work'.

A special issue of Development\u000a        in Practice based on papers presented at the colloquium was\u000a      published in 2012, and has informed a consultation on child protection\u000a      policy at the UNICEF Office of Research, Florence, and UNICEF New York,\u000a      which will reshape global approaches to child protection [C6].\u000a      Young Lives research on children's work is being incorporated by World\u000a      Vision UK into revised programming on children's work [C1]; and\u000a      used by Save the Children Canada and Plan International to promote a focus\u000a      globally on eliminating hazardous child work rather than prohibiting all\u000a      forms of work by children. Young Lives child protection research has been\u000a      incorporated into a UNICEF report on social protection and child\u000a      protection (2013) [C6].\u000a    The Bond Child Rights Group (formerly DFID\/CSO child rights working group\u000a      of 20 UK NGOs and research organisations working on child rights in\u000a      international development and foreign policy) uses a model Young Lives\u000a      piloted in 2012, bringing researchers together to discuss their work to\u000a      strengthen the use of evidence and best practice.

This group of researchers has had a\u000a      long history of working in partnership with the UK's Department for\u000a      International Development (DFID).\u000a    In 2000, DFID commissioned Young Lives to map the progress of the\u000a      Millennium Development Goals and to inform future programming for\u000a      children. Young Lives, the first comparative, longitudinal, mixed-methods\u000a      (quantitative and qualitative) study of children in developing countries,\u000a      follows 12,000 children in two age cohorts in Ethiopia, India (Andhra\u000a      Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam over 15 years. A baseline survey was conducted\u000a      in 2002, Round 2 in 2007, Round 3 in 2009, and Round 4 in 2013. A final\u000a      survey round will take place in 2016. It takes time for the impact of\u000a      longitudinal research to be felt, but the scientific power of Young Lives\u000a      grows with each data round, providing compelling evidence on the effects\u000a      of poverty, inequality and risk across critical periods of the lifespan as\u000a      children are followed from infancy through formal schooling to work and\u000a      early adulthood.\u000a    The research team at Oxford are: Professor Jo Boyden (Director from\u000a      2006), Professor Stefan Dercon (quantitative lead, 2006-12), Dr Virginia\u000a      Morrow (Senior Research Officer, from 2011), Dr Laura Camfield (Senior\u000a      Research Officer, 2007-10), Dr Gina Crivello (Senior Research Officer,\u000a      from 2007), Dr Andreas Georgiadis (Senior Research Officer, from 2011), Dr\u000a      Rozana Himaz (Research Officer, 2008-10), Dr Sofya Krutikova (Research\u000a      Officer, from 2011), Dr Caine Rolleston (Research Officer, 2012-13),\u000a      Abhijeet Singh (Research Officer, from 2012), Professor Martin Woodhead\u000a      (Senior Advisor from 2006 and Professor of Childhood Studies at the Open\u000a      University).\u000a    Research insights:\u000a    Child poverty: Poverty and associated risks have profound\u000a      implications for children; these persist throughout their lives and affect\u000a      future generations [see Section 3: R1]. Nutritional deprivation in\u000a      early childhood is found to have lasting effects on cognitive development\u000a      and socio- emotional skills [R2]. This evidence endorses policies\u000a      that focus on the first 1,000 days of a child's life. However,\u000a      ground-breaking research by Georgiadis and colleagues [R3] points\u000a      to the potential for dramatic changes (improvement or deterioration) in\u000a      children's nutritional status and associated variations in cognitive\u000a      development up to the age of 8, with socioeconomic and local\u000a      infrastructural factors determinant. This body of work emphasises the\u000a      importance of remedial interventions to support individual recovery and\u000a      reduce disparities between children [R1-R3].\u000a    Inequality: Risk and deprivation are concentrated in particular\u000a      social groups and localities, with dramatic disparities in child\u000a      development outcomes. Children's experience of inequality shapes their\u000a      personal and social identities, peer relationships, self-esteem and\u000a      self-efficacy. During early childhood, socioeconomic and household\u000a      characteristics are much stronger determinants of disparities between\u000a      children than gender; these become more significant as children grow older\u000a      [R4]. But, contrary to received wisdom, boys are not always\u000a      advantaged and only in India is there a strong `institutionalised' gender\u000a      bias against girls in education. Subjective well-being (i.e children's own\u000a      perception) is both a major indicator of inequality, and also a channel\u000a      for the transmission of poverty. Research on children's educational\u000a      outcomes reveals persistent and widening inequalities in Ethiopia, India\u000a      and Peru, but not in Vietnam [R5]. In Peru, family background\u000a      determines the kind of schooling children access. In Vietnam, children\u000a      from less advantaged households enter school with poorer cognitive skills\u000a      but make good progress [R1, R5]. This evidence points to the need\u000a      for multidimensional, integrated solutions to childhood poverty and to\u000a      policies that aim to overcome structural causes of inequalities rather\u000a      than focusing solely on income and economic growth [R1].\u000a    Child protection: By the age of 12, one in five Young Lives\u000a      children in Ethiopia had lost at least one parent, but analysis shows that\u000a      outcomes are different depending on the children's age and whether they\u000a      had lost their mother or father [R6]. Krutikova (2009)\u000a      (`Determinants of Child Labour'. Young Lives Working Paper 48)\u000a      found that not only do increasing proportions of children work as they\u000a      grow older, but this is often in response to family income shocks, and\u000a      sensitive to household composition in terms of the age and gender of other\u000a      children. Morrow and Vennam (2010) (`Combining School and Work'. Children\u000a        &amp; Society 24 (4): 304-14) shows that children's work in cotton\u000a      pollination, which interferes with school attendance, is undertaken not\u000a      just for economic reasons but also in response to social norms as to their\u000a      family role. These two elements of research provide evidence for child\u000a      protection policies relating to orphanhood and children's work.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7755","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    2,000 Blackfoot Elders, ceremonialists, teachers, and youth (c.5% of a\u000d\u000a      tribal population of\u000d\u000a      approximately 42,000), and over 50,000 museum professionals and visitors\u000d\u000a      in Alberta and across\u000d\u000a      the UK, benefited from project impacts.

Research findings are therefore\u000d\u000a      entirely new and\u000d\u000a      constitute a baseline for further studies. Two major findings emerged.\u000d\u000a      First, the stimulus of touch,\u000d\u000a      the sense of being in the presence of the ancestors who made the shirts,\u000d\u000a      and the sociality of the\u000d\u000a      handling sessions was therapeutic on several levels for Blackfoot\u000d\u000a      participants (see section 4), and\u000d\u000a      strengthened identity and culture by provoking the transmission of\u000d\u000a      cultural knowledge amongst\u000d\u000a      participants.[R4,R5,R6] Second, while established handling projects\u000d\u000a      in museums, hospitals, and\u000d\u000a      old-age homes use reproductions, or less fragile objects, the research\u000d\u000a      indicated that it is possible\u000d\u000a      to facilitate the use of fragile historic objects in certain\u000d\u000a      situations&#8212;and worthwhile to do so given\u000d\u000a      the potential for museum objects to act as catalysts for postcolonial\u000d\u000a      social healing in indigenous\u000d\u000a      communities.[R4,R6]\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11813","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Implementation of our research through BARCIK\u000a    Since the conference launch of the BARCIK network in 1998, Sillitoe has\u000a      continued to advise and\u000a      support BARCIK on policy and strategy (Sources 1 and 2) throughout the REF\u000a      period.

It\u000a      now has 125 full-time\u000a      and 20 part-time volunteers.\u000a    An extensive field audit of BARCIK's work in 2011 (Source 5) provides\u000a      strong independent\u000a      evidence for the effectiveness of BARCIK's impact during the REF period.\u000a      The report was\u000a      commissioned by MISEREOR, the German Catholic charity, who donated &#163;666k\u000a      in the period to\u000a      BARCIK for 7 projects including conservation, climate change and green\u000a      village initiatives and\u000a      carried out by FAKT (www.fakt.consult.de).\u000a      The report examined impacts from interventions in 4\u000a      villages before 2008 and in 5 villages after 2009 (Source 5 p8), noting\u000a      that \"BARCIK is ... active in\u000a        14 ... agro-ecological zones of Bangladesh' reaching \"a great\u000a        variety of different farmers, fishers,\u000a        forest dwellers and landless people\" (p6). The audit states that 14\u000a      villages (14,800 people) had\u000a      taken up IK knowledge exchange practices promoted by BARCIK in 2011 (p11)\u000a      and that ' (A)n\u000a        alternative way of doing agricultural development combining modern\u000a        technology and the\u000a        indigenous knowledge and practices of ... people has been found to be\u000a        effective in increasing\u000a        farmers' productivity.\" (Source 5: p4), demonstrating the influence\u000a      of our innovative call to merge\u000a      IK and scientific technology (Output 1).\u000a    For example, farmers' knowledge about local rice varieties and their\u000a      cultivation was effective in\u000a      mounting resistance to the promotion of monocrop, high yield cultivars\u000a      which are expensive, rely\u000a      on fertilisers and weedicides, and rapidly exhaust soil productivity\u000a      (Source 5). As one BARCIK-supported\u000a      farmer put it: `Earlier we had only 3 or 4 types of seeds, but now we\u000a        have 60 or 70 ...\u000a        Officers from the Agricultural Department of the Government appreciated\u000a        the works of BARCIK\u000a        saying that what they couldn't do, BARCIK has done. We have learnt how\u000a        to preserve seeds\u000a        properly from BARCIK... We have learnt about the dry seedbeds of paddy\u000a        and now we can plant\u000a        much younger ... saplings that give us better yields. Whereas earlier we\u000a        used to plant saplings of\u000a        2-3 months that resulted in premature harvesting with less yields.'\u000a      (Source 4). This impact is\u000a      corroborated by a BARCIK co-ordinator: Following (Sillitoe's) research\u000a        we sought to show how\u000a      jhum (local shifting cultivation systems) vary widely and feature\u000a        complex natural resource\u000a        management strategies ' (Source 3).\u000a    The MISEROR report concluded that \"BARCIK has contributed to higher\u000a        food security and less\u000a        vulnerability of poor farmers... The status of women has improved...\u000a        Farmer-to-farmer\u000a        relationships have improved.\" and noted: \"There were many social\u000a        effects ...on accessing\u000a        government support, and ...much multiplication, spreading sustainable\u000a        farming practices to many\u000a        more villages. There was also news coverage ... that led to more\u000a        awareness\" (Source 5: p24).\u000a    Training Bangladeshi NGO practitioners\u000a    Beyond BARCIK, our research has informed Bangladeshi university curricula\u000a      for training a new\u000a      generation of local NGO practitioners: IK-aware strategies are now\u000a      integral to the preparation of\u000a      NGO workers for the field: `... they found it [Sillitoe's approach]\u000a        very inspiring .., many students\u000a        have gone through them [Manual guidelines]. His work in ethno-science\u000a        has been particularly\u000a        helpful to us on the food security programme where we have made much use\u000a        of the methodologies\u000a        that he gives in his books. For instance in researching and promoting\u000a        local crop varieties\u000a        threatened by the HYVs (high yield varieties) of the green revolution\u000a        which are proving\u000a        unsustainable and damaging to our country's natural resources...'\u000a      (Source 6).\u000a    Impact beyond Bangladesh\u000a    Work extending and implementing our IK research in Bangladesh continued\u000a      with UNESCO (Social\u000a      &amp; Human Sciences Sector) funding from its Local &amp; Indigenous\u000a      Knowledge Systems Programme\u000a      (LINKS) for a project entitled `Documentation and application of\u000a      indigenous knowledge in Charan,\u000a      Bangladesh' (2002-7).

In response, the\u000a      ODA's (now DfID) 1994 Renewable Natural Resources Research Strategy funded\u000a      Durham and\u000a      Newcastle Universities for an `Investigation of whole farm strategies and\u000a      resource use patterns in\u000a      floodplain production systems based on rice and fish in Bangladesh'. The\u000a      ODA emphasised IK\u000a      inclusion, but our research took IK understanding and practice to a\u000a      significant, new level.\u000a    Research narrative\u000a    The IK component of the project was called `Methodological research into\u000a      the incorporation of\u000a      indigenous knowledge into natural resources research on Bangladesh\u000a      floodplain production\u000a      systems' (Grant 1) and ran 1996-2000. The team, led by Paul Sillitoe,\u000a      comprised local researchers\u000a      (Alam, Ghosh, Zuberi and Naseem) and Durham staff (Dixon). Together they\u000a      assembled a detailed\u000a      ethnographic database documenting local livelihoods, subsistence practices\u000a      and biodiversity.\u000a      Collecting and disseminating IK was achieved through Durham\u000a      Anthropology establishing a\u000a      network in 1998 which centred on the nascent Bangladeshi Resource Centre\u000a      for Indigenous\u000a      Knowledge (BARCIK) as a pathway to impact (Output 3 is from the launch\u000a      conference).\u000a    In 1998, based on the Bangladeshi research, two influential papers laid\u000a      out an innovative strategy\u000a      for incorporating IK productively into development practice and\u000a      sustainable resource management\u000a      (Outputs1, 2). They demonstrated that (a) unequal power relations between\u000a      local peoples and\u000a      experts in many development projects excluded and obscured the\u000a      contribution of local\u000a      environmental knowledge and expertise to sustainable livelihood\u000a      strategies, (b) development\u000a      practitioners were newly receptive to alternative approaches, and (c) if\u000a      the interests, techniques,\u000a      practices and worldviews of local people and development scientists were\u000a      aligned, the likelihood of\u000a      successful, sustainable interventions increased markedly.\u000a    These papers helped shift the emphasis of previous IK research from\u000a      documenting local ecological\u000a      classifications to a more careful evaluation of the effects and importance\u000a      of IK as it was practised\u000a      and in context. Crucially, the papers drew attention to the need to\u000a      identify, preserve and share\u000a      viable local knowledge and practice (Outputs 4,5). While debates on the\u000a      nature and role of IK\u000a      continue, our interventions have been cited as kick-starting ongoing\u000a      critiques of, and alternatives to\u000a      techno-scientific and market-led approaches to resource management (Output\u000a      1)\u000a    Rather than a dichotomous model of external technical approaches or\u000a      IK, our research has\u000a      provided vital underpinning evidence for an approach in which scientists\u000a      (local and international)\u000a      and indigenous communities share understandings and work together for more\u000a      effective resource\u000a      management (Outputs 2, 3). The focus on ethnoscience, or people's own ways\u000a      of making sense of\u000a      their environment and its capacities, shows the importance of creating a\u000a      knowledge and practice\u000a      continuum connecting local people and natural scientists (Output 1).\u000a      Moreover, our research\u000a      shows that IK is continually evolving and adapting to meet the challenges\u000a      of population growth,\u000a      climate change, community dislocation and the impact of globalisation\u000a      (Output 1). It demonstrates\u000a      that in circumstances of environmental precariousness, development works\u000a      best as an exchange\u000a      between local communities, scientists and development workers and also\u000a      between\/within local\u000a      practitioners and local communities (Output 2).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11814","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Durham Sleep Lab research findings have made a clear impact upon a)\u000d\u000a      infant sleep safety\u000d\u000a      recommendations and campaigns, b) hospital and community infant care\u000d\u000a      practice, policies and\u000d\u000a      guidance for staff and c) parental ability to make informed-choices about\u000d\u000a      infant sleep\u000d\u000a      arrangements.

Our research\u000a      identified significant transport challenges faced by rural communities,\u000a      which include the socio-economic, physical, and mental costs of travelling\u000a      long distances in off-road areas. Children, women and the elderly are\u000a      particularly affected. The negative health effects of carrying large loads\u000a      by head are disproportionately borne by women and children (Outputs 1 and\u000a      4).\u000a    Research narrative\u000a    DfID-funded Durham research (R7149) before 2000 had highlighted that\u000a      inadequate rural transport in Ghana created significant post-harvest\u000a      losses for poor households unable to take their crops to market. In\u000a      response, in 2000, with the Ghanaian Ministry of Food and Agriculture,\u000a      Durham received further DfID funding (Grant 1) to evaluate the impact of\u000a      Intermediate Means of Transport (IMT) interventions (e.g. hand-carts and\u000a      bicycles) on post-harvest activities. Findings showed that IMT reduced\u000a      women's carrying loads and facilitated family mobility, but that child\u000a      labour increased as a result since children were recruited to push carts\u000a      and operate other IMT equipment in addition to their usual domestic\u000a      load-carrying work (with its reported negative education and health\u000a      impacts) Outputs 2 and 4). Crucially, our research also revealed a severe\u000a      lack of knowledge about child mobility more broadly and transport\u000a      challenges within Ghana's government, including the Ministries of\u000a      Transport and Education (Output 1).\u000a    As a result of these findings, we received pilot funding in 2004 from\u000a      DfID (Grant 2), followed by full funding in 2006 from ESRC\/DfID (Grant 3),\u000a      to study the particular challenges of child mobility and load carrying.\u000a      Using action research, and training 70 young people across 24 field-sites\u000a      (from urban to remote rural locations) in Ghana, Malawi and South Africa\u000a      to work as co-researchers alongside experienced researchers, we provided\u000a      evidence of the implications of routine mobility constraints for\u000a      livelihoods, life chances, education, health and gender equity. This\u000a      research showed that child porterage, especially among girls, is\u000a      economically important for areas such as water, sanitation, energy and\u000a      agriculture but also confirmed that labour responsibilities combined with\u000a      long, dangerous journeys undermine individual educational achievement and\u000a      life chances: a failure to understand why children were often late\u000a      for school because of transport problems led to regular, harsh punishments\u000a      by teachers. Again, the negative effects were more evident upon girls\u000a      (Outputs 2, 3, and 4). Research also highlighted frequent dissonances\u000a      between donor understandings of how rural groups operated and empirical\u000a      evidence, which resulted in ineffective interventions (Output 5).\u000a    A further finding of research conducted under Grants 2 and 3 was the\u000a      importance of satisfactory transport infrastructure for older people.\u000a      Building on this, DfID awarded us further funding in 2012 to address\u000a      transport and mobility problems of older people in rural Tanzanian\u000a      communities (Grant 4). Again using action research and trained peer\u000a      researchers, we demonstrated, in collaboration with HelpAge Tanzania, how\u000a      lack of access to good transport has negative effects on the health,\u000a      livelihoods and caring responsibilities of older people (Output 6). Since\u000a      the last is a vital element of household and community economies, there\u000a      are significant ramifications of the inability of an older generation to\u000a      care for children.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13513","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aClinical impact in Uganda and Tanzania\u000d\u000aIn Uganda, the underpinning research was used to demonstrate to local leaders and health officers\u000d\u000awhy the existing approaches to treatment were failing. This led to the acceptance of the suggested\u000d\u000aalternative strategies in several locations. His Royal Highness Charles Okumu Ombidi III confirmed\u000d\u000athat \"At first there was a reluctance by many people here to take the drugs, but after your work and\u000d\u000ayour help with sensitising the people, there was widespread recognition that it is important to get\u000d\u000aregular treatment for this disease...following your recommendations in 2008 and 2009, the\u000d\u000aprocedure for distributing drugs changed in Panyimur sub-county...the local council representatives\u000d\u000atook responsibility for distributing the drugs in their localities. This helped a lot. Many people came\u000d\u000aforward for treatment and coverage was much higher.\" [A] Similarly, the Mayor of Nebbi District\u000d\u000aconfirmed that \"the discussions we had on various updates on your findings offered us a great\u000d\u000ainsight on the health situations in the district especially along Lake Albert and River Nile...as a\u000d\u000aresult it initiated behavioral and attitude change in the local population who were initially resistant\u000d\u000ato use of drugs whereas they were in dear need of treatment. This I believe was achieved through\u000d\u000ayour participatory approach of research, community mobilization and sensitization.\" [B]\u000d\u000aIn Tanzania, the research showed that the majority of the study population in coastal areas were\u000d\u000aresisting treatment for lymphatic filariasis. Parker and Allen suggested to Tanzanian officials that\u000d\u000aMDA should be supplemented with the provision of free surgery for those with hydroceles (swollen\u000d\u000ascrotums), because the men who were successfully treated would then become positive examples\u000d\u000aand advocates for the MDA programme. In 2008 this advice was acted upon and 200 men were\u000d\u000aoffered hydrocelectomies [C]. Research in 2011 confirmed that this had an impact on the uptake of\u000d\u000adrugs in those locations in which appropriate follow-up occurred. In one study village (with an\u000d\u000aestimated population of 2000), uptake increased from 40% in 2007 to more than 90% in 2010.\u000d\u000aInfluencing practice\u000d\u000aIn 2008 the initial findings [1] were published indicating that MDA in combination with other\u000d\u000aapproaches could be effective but that MDA delivered in a context-free manner commonly faltered\u000d\u000aor failed. These findings garnered attention from key figures and institutions involved in the battle\u000d\u000aagainst infectious disease. The head of the Vector Control Division in the Ugandan Ministry of\u000d\u000aHealth, Dr. Narcis Kabatereine, cited this research in discussing the realities on the ground and the\u000d\u000aways in which the current NTD control programme could be \"jeopardised\". [D] The research was\u000d\u000alikewise cited by Professor Adel Mahmoud, a highly respected expert on schistosomiasis and\u000d\u000aglobal health policy at Princeton University and former head of Merck Vaccines, and Professor\u000d\u000aElias Zerhouni at Johns Hopkins Medicine and former head of the US National Institutes of Health.\u000d\u000aWriting in Health Affairs, a journal read by policy-makers, practitioners and scholars worldwide,\u000d\u000aMahmoud and Zerhouni [E] echoed Parker and Allen's argument for educational and\u000d\u000acommunications strategies at the local level and agreed that \"Winning the battle against infectious\u000d\u000adiseases will require more than purely technological solutions\".\u000d\u000aThe research was also discussed in numerous formal and less formal meetings, including closed\u000d\u000asessions of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in June 2009, at which representatives of WHO\u000d\u000awere present, and at DfID the following December. The WHO's Tropical Disease Research (TDR)\u000d\u000adivision then commissioned Parker and Allen to write an article on the roll-out of MDA in Uganda\u000d\u000aas one of a series of papers considering how NTD research and practice \"still largely neglect the\u000d\u000asocial, ecological, and other contextual factors that allow diseases to persist in specific\u000d\u000apopulations\". The paper [2] was made publicly available on TDR's website in January 2011[F], and\u000d\u000awas cited in the lead paper of the series authored by TDR Steering Committee member Pascale\u000d\u000aAllotey and her colleagues [F] to draw attention to implementation problems at the community level\u000d\u000aand to call for social science research to assess the effectiveness of NTD control programmes.\u000d\u000aThe paper was also circulated for discussion to delegates at the 2011 International Society for\u000d\u000aInfectious Diseases conference, and has been noted as one of the most important publications\u000d\u000aabout schistosomiasis in Expert Reviews, which described it as an \"important evaluation\u000d\u000ahighlighting that community compliance with praziquantel treatment needs careful attention\" [G].\u000d\u000aIn February 2011 the underpinning research was again featured in an article written by Parker and\u000d\u000aAllen [3] for a special issue of Third World Quarterly called \"The Millennium Development Goals:\u000d\u000achallenges, prospects and opportunities\". Allen and Parker's call for a biosocial approach was\u000d\u000aechoed by UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon in his Preface to the issue when he pointed to\u000d\u000a\"knowledge gained over the past decade about the effectiveness of taking a holistic approach\".\u000d\u000aChallenging MDA strategies\u000d\u000aThe high profile of the Third World Quarterly article, and the call it made to rethink a context-free\u000d\u000aMDA approach, became the impetus for debate among NTD policy makers and academics. A\u000d\u000avehement defence of the traditional MDA approach in a leading medical journal prompted Parker\u000d\u000aand Allen to submit a letter to The Lancet in January 2012 entitled `Will increased funding for NTDs\u000d\u000areally make poverty history?' [H]. The letter again outlined some of the difficulties with current\u000d\u000astrategies, observed the lack of critical analysis and debate about \"what is actually occurring on the\u000d\u000aground\", and called for an evidence-based and integrated biosocial approach. Published on the\u000d\u000afront page, the letter was timed to appear on the eve of an international meeting in London at\u000d\u000awhich DfID, USAID, the UAE governments, the Gates Foundation, 13 pharmaceutical companies,\u000d\u000athe World Bank and other global health organisations were announcing a coordinated partnership\u000d\u000ato eliminate 10 NTDs by 2020, involving commitments of over $785 million and significant in-kind\u000d\u000asupport. The timing and content of the letter provoked a storm of controversy, and responses from\u000d\u000aleading proponents and critics of context-free MDA were published in The Lancet. The debate was\u000d\u000anoted in the Guardian [I] and by DFID, which had committed &#163;195 million to the NTD global\u000d\u000apartnership.\u000d\u000aSoon, however, the debate began to turn and the significance of the underpinning research to be\u000d\u000apublicly acknowledged. In June 2012 Parker and Allen made a keynote address at the International\u000d\u000aSociety for Neglected Tropical Diseases conference at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical\u000d\u000aMedicine. At that meeting, the head of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative at Imperial College, a\u000d\u000aleading figure in the MDA community, stated to a surprised audience that the kind of work Parker\u000d\u000aand Allen had been doing needed to be done at all sites at which mass drug administration was\u000d\u000abeing implemented. In December 2012, Parker and Allen were invited to a meeting in the UK\u000d\u000aParliament on the possibilities of mass drug administration, where they discussed their findings\u000d\u000awith DfID's Chief Scientific Advisor and head of research, Professor Chris Whitty. A month later,\u000d\u000aAllen and Parker's research was mentioned during a debate on NTDs in the House of Lords, with\u000d\u000athe Earl of Sandwich, the Lord Bishop of Derby and Lord Rae citing their findings and most of the\u000d\u000aspeakers endorsing communication, training and a biosocial approach [J]. Following this, Parker\u000d\u000aand Allen were asked to address MPs specifically about the problems with MDA for lymphatic\u000d\u000afilariasis at the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Malaria and NTDs. In this session, one of the\u000d\u000aleading proponents of MDA openly acknowledged that their research was having a profound effect\u000d\u000aon shifting approaches to drug distribution and monitoring.\u000d\u000aIn July 2013 an international conference was convened in London by Parker and Allen with Dr\u000d\u000aKatja Polman of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp to bring together people from across\u000d\u000athe debate. The 20-plus attendees included many of the leading supporters of MDA as well as\u000d\u000asenior figures from African countries. The impact of the research was again explicitly\u000d\u000aacknowledged, and there was detailed discussion of how policies were now being reformulated to\u000d\u000atake the findings into account. A range of views were filmed and made available online [L]\u000d\u000aWhy does it matter: Over one billion people are at risk or already afflicted by NTDs, 40 countries\u000d\u000ahave multi-year NTD plans and close to &#163;1 billion in funding and in-kind assistance is committed to\u000d\u000athe control or elimination of NTDs in the next five years. Only the locally sensitive and effective\u000d\u000adeployment of this assistance will assure the permanent defeat of these diseases and the\u000d\u000aalleviation of their deleterious impact on lives, societies and economies around the world.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aA research collaboration between Brunel University and LSE has demonstrated that large-scale\u000d\u000aprogrammes to control Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) through Mass Drug Administration\u000d\u000a(MDA) can be ineffective, primarily because of flawed assumptions about local realities in\u000d\u000adeveloping countries.

NTDs cause significant\u000d\u000amorbidity (i.e. poor health, disease or disability) among politically and economically marginal\u000d\u000apopulations. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 120 million people are currently\u000d\u000aaffected by lymphatic filariasis, with about 40 million displaying clinical signs of infection such as\u000d\u000ahydrocele (swollen scrotum) and lymphoedema\/elephantiasis (swollen limbs). Estimates for\u000d\u000aschistosomiasis are even higher: more than 200 million people are affected and a further 600\u000d\u000amillion people are at risk of infection. International assistance over the past ten years, including\u000d\u000amassive donations of medicines, has enabled several countries to design and implement large-scale\u000d\u000aprogrammes, referred to as Mass Drug Administration (MDA), in which free treatment is\u000d\u000agiven to adults and children living in areas where these diseases are endemic.\u000d\u000aFrom 2005, Dr Melissa Parker was part of an international, multi-disciplinary programme (based at\u000d\u000aImperial College) to assess the impact of current strategies to control NTDs. Parker, and Professor\u000d\u000aTim Allen from the London School of Economics, shared equal responsibility for the social\u000d\u000aresearch component of the programme. They each undertook 16 months of fieldwork in Tanzania\u000d\u000aand Uganda and supervised a dozen postgraduate students from UK and African institutions.\u000d\u000aAround 100 sites across Uganda and Tanzania were studied intensively between 2005 and 2011.\u000d\u000aParker and Allen's research findings have highlighted the following:\u000d\u000aSocial context: This influences the take-up of drugs with direct consequences for disease\u000d\u000atransmission. In Uganda, for example, where fisherfolk are highly likely to be infected with\u000d\u000aschistosomiasis, many are not receiving treatment because they live on islands in the rivers and\u000d\u000alakes, whereas drug distribution is focussed in villages on the mainland. This is particularly\u000d\u000aproblematic because the fisherfolk use the river as a latrine, potentially causing the reinfection of\u000d\u000aanyone who has been treated and goes into the river. [1,2,4,5]\u000d\u000aIneffective communication: Explanations for MDA have not been made a priority. For example, in\u000d\u000a2008 violent riots were observed in Tanzania when parents became convinced that tablets were\u000d\u000abeing given out in schools to sterilise their children. [3,5]\u000d\u000aSide-effects: MDA can have side-effects. These not only affect people's willingness to take the\u000d\u000adrugs, but also raise doubts about the merits of treating those who may be under-nourished,\u000d\u000amalnourished, immune-compromised and\/or infected with multiple parasitic infections. Parker and\u000d\u000aAllen were the first to describe significant side effects from mass treatment with praziquantel (for\u000d\u000aschistosomiasis control) and their research has been recognised in the biomedical literature. [1]\u000d\u000aNTDs differ: It is unhelpful to treat NTDs as a homogeneous group. The subjective experiences of\u000d\u000atheir signs and symptoms vary within and between populations and this influences drug uptake. [3]\u000d\u000aEthical challenges: These are numerous. A particular concern raised by the research was that\u000d\u000achildren were observed being given the incorrect medication by school teachers who had not been\u000d\u000aappropriately trained. Treatment in schools was also observed to have occurred without adequate\u000d\u000aparental consent. [6]\u000d\u000aMonitoring and evaluation: Existing mechanisms for assessing programmes are insufficient. There\u000d\u000ahas been a failure to recognise the low levels of drug take-up in some locations or to adequately\u000d\u000aassess the biological and social effects of the programme. Assessments of MDA tend to mix\u000d\u000aadvocacy with research in misleading ways. Also, advocates of MDA are prone to making\u000d\u000amisleading assertions. For example, eradication of lymphatic filariasis in coastal Tanzania by 2020\u000d\u000ais an impossibility without changing current strategies.

With\u000d\u000a      Fraser McNeill, Niehaus wrote a review for the Centre for the Study of\u000d\u000a      AIDS in Pretoria, entitled Magic. The Centre distributed 3,500\u000d\u000a      copies to libraries, organisations, and funders in the AIDS Industry (such\u000d\u000a      as Oxfam). This study can be accessed on internet and has to date\u000d\u000a      registered 2,229 downloads, which is more than any other review published\u000d\u000a      by the Centre. The monograph, Witchcraft and a Life in the New South\u000d\u000a        Africa (2013) is written in popular, accessible language. In June\u000d\u000a      2013, it was reviewed in the London Review of Books (by Jeremy\u000d\u000a      Harding), and the Times Literary Supplement (by Tanya Luhrmann).\u000d\u000a      Niehaus gave interviews to the English service of South African FM Radio\u000d\u000a      in 2008 and to HBO television in the United States in 2013. The latter\u000d\u000a      show draws over 1 million viewers.\u000d\u000a    (ii) Shaping of Public Debate. The media have cited Niehaus's\u000d\u000a      argument that in an era of deindustrialisation male sexual violence\u000d\u000a      dramatises the ideal of lost masculine dominance. This suggests that\u000d\u000a      women's empowerment alone is unlikely to curb the spread of HIV, and\u000d\u000a      highlights the need for prevention campaigns to address men's gendered\u000d\u000a      concerns. A colloquium on violence against women and the structural\u000d\u000a      drivers of HIV\/AIDS, hosted by the organisation 30\/30 in Johannesburg on\u000d\u000a      11 August 2010, debated Niehaus's work. He is also listed as an expert on\u000d\u000a      the gender and security research hub of the Social Sciences Research\u000d\u000a      Council in New York. The Hub provides researchers, policy shapers, and\u000d\u000a      practitioners with the evidence needed to advance their work and\u000d\u000a      contribute to increasing women's security. An influential research report\u000d\u000a      by the South African AIDS Foundation, entitled `Towards the Development\u000d\u000a        of an Integrated Model for the Effective Provision of Heath Care on\u000d\u000a        Community Level' (2009), refers to Niehaus's arguments on AIDS\u000d\u000a      stigma and on the connections between AIDS and witchcraft.\u000d\u000a    (iii) Contribution to the training of academic and health personnel.\u000d\u000a      Niehaus' work regularly features in syllabi of courses taught at prominent\u000d\u000a      universities, some with a strong applied element. These include courses in\u000d\u000a      political anthropology at Galway in Ireland; African History at Maryland\u000d\u000a      (US); religion and society in Denmark; and anthropology in Aberdeen and\u000d\u000a      Illinois. A course offered by the Centre for Faculty Development at Emory\u000d\u000a      University in Atlanta called `Viral Cultures' devotes a full week to\u000d\u000a      Niehaus's research on death and dying. Pearson Holdings South Africa\u000d\u000a      recently requested permission from Niehaus to reproduce sections of Magic\u000d\u000a      in the influential volume, HIV and AIDS: Education, Care and\u000d\u000a        Counselling (5th edition). The volume is used as a\u000d\u000a      training manual for nurses and AIDS counsellors.\u000d\u000a    (iv) Assistance in the Work of Legal Personnel. Niehaus has\u000d\u000a      participated in two influential workshops geared towards empowering legal\u000d\u000a      personnel to deal more effectively with cases involving witchcraft. In\u000d\u000a      August 2010 he worked as an instructor in a course organised by FAHUMA and\u000d\u000a      the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The course examined\u000d\u000a      different means of assisting the victims of witchcraft related violence,\u000d\u000a      and determining their entitlement to refugee protection and human rights.\u000d\u000a      In 2013 he was also a discussant at a workshop entitled `Witchcraft,\u000d\u000a      Spirit Possession and Anthropological Expertise in Legal Contexts' at the\u000d\u000a      London School of Economics. The workshop involved lawyers, social workers\u000d\u000a      and police. Niehaus is currently listed as a specialist on witchcraft by\u000d\u000a      the FAHUMA Refugee for legal AID Network.\u000d\u000a    In February 2013, Niehaus advised Ian Nichols, the chief lawyer\u000d\u000a      representing the families of 34 deceased miners at the Farlam Commission\u000d\u000a      of Enquiry in South Africa. In 2012, police killed the miners whilst they\u000d\u000a      engaged in a strike near Marikana mine. He wrote a critique of a report\u000d\u000a      submitted by an anthropologist suggesting that the police acted in\u000d\u000a      self-defence. The report contends that the miners had used a potion called\u000d\u000a      intelezi, which they believed rendered them invulnerable, invisible\u000d\u000a      and invincible, should they attack the police. Niehaus disputes the claim\u000d\u000a      on the ground of insufficient evidence, contending that miners simply used\u000d\u000a      intelezi to ensure the success of their wage demands.\u000d\u000a    (v) Assistance in the Production of Cultural Artefacts. Niehaus\u000d\u000a      contributed two chapters to the catalogue of an exhibition at the\u000d\u000a      Johannesburg Art Gallery called Dungamanzi\/Stirring Waters. The\u000d\u000a      innovative exhibition displays items used by Shangaan diviners and\u000d\u000a      healers. The exhibition stood from 2007 to 2013. Niehaus granted an\u000d\u000a      extensive interview on the topic of conspiracy theories and AIDS to HBO\u000d\u000a      Public Television from New York. The programme is to be screened on the\u000d\u000a      popular Vice Show throughout the United States.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Six million South Africans are currently infected with HIV and two\u000d\u000a      million have died from AIDS- related diseases.

He has visited the field site for at least one month each year.\u000d\u000a      Within the larger body of social scientific literature on AIDS, Niehaus's\u000d\u000a      work focuses on rural contexts and on deep cultural meanings. The\u000d\u000a      multi-temporal nature of the fieldwork has provided Niehaus with a unique\u000d\u000a      perspective on the local history of the pandemic. He has worked with the\u000d\u000a      active collaboration of Eliazaar Mohlala and Eric Thobela, two local\u000d\u000a      residents employed as research assistants, and he has collaborated with a\u000d\u000a      number of South African scholars, including Mary Crewe (Centre for the\u000d\u000a      Study of AIDS in Pretoria); Jonathan Stadler (School of Public Health,\u000d\u000a      University of the Witwatersrand) and Frazer McNeill (Department of\u000d\u000a      Anthropology and Archaeology, University of Pretoria).\u000d\u000a    The research findings have challenged several orthodoxies.\u000d\u000a    (i) Questioning AIDS Stigma. The central argument has been that\u000d\u000a      in the South African lowveld the stigma of AIDS is due not to its\u000d\u000a      association with promiscuous sexuality but to its association with death.\u000d\u000a      Niehaus suggests that persons living with AIDS are perceived as `dead\u000d\u000a      before dying' and as located in the liminal domain between the categories\u000d\u000a      of `life' and `death' &#8212; an outcome of health workers' emphasis on\u000d\u000a      prevention and their portrayal of AIDS as a fatal, untreatable condition.\u000d\u000a    (ii) Religion and AIDS Stigma. Niehaus suggests that Christian\u000d\u000a      churches, particularly Zionist Congregations, have actively contributed\u000d\u000a      towards stigmatising sick persons by constructing AIDS as a new, deadlier\u000d\u000a      kind of leprosy with all its overtones of divine punishment.\u000d\u000a    (iii) Gender and AIDS. Niehaus's research has illuminated the\u000d\u000a      gendered nature of AIDS, documenting how sexual violence has facilitated\u000d\u000a      the spread of HIV. He has shown that men are more likely than women to\u000d\u000a      resist biomedical paradigms and to accept conspiracy theories concerning\u000d\u000a      the origin and spread of HIV\/AIDS. Men's commitment to political paradigms\u000d\u000a      is due to their location in the public sphere and their traumatic\u000d\u000a      experiences of deindustrialisation. This finding highlights the need for\u000d\u000a      health workers to be sensitive to men's gendered concerns.\u000d\u000a    (iv) Witchcraft, Culpability and AIDS. Niehaus has argued that a\u000d\u000a      reluctance to test for HIV antibodies relates to the issue of culpability.\u000d\u000a      Accepting that one is HIV-positive often amounts to an acknowledgement\u000d\u000a      that one might have infected sexual partners with a potentially deadly\u000d\u000a      virus. Hence people often respond to HIV\/AIDs with silence. Otherwise,\u000d\u000a      they might deflect culpability by claiming that they had been victims of\u000d\u000a      witchcraft.

As a result of\u000a      this work, IMI researchers were asked to join the advisory board and\u000a      provide two crucial background papers [R8, R9] for the UNDP's Human\u000a        Development Report 2009. Overcoming Barriers: Human Mobility and\u000a        Development. IMI's research played a major role in influencing the\u000a      conceptualisation of human mobility in the report (see acknowledgement p.\u000a      vii), which called for extensive policy reforms to maximise the potential\u000a      development benefits of migration. Its critique of the concept of\u000a      South-South migration was important in UNDP's decision to revise the\u000a      categories it used for the Human Development Index [see Section 5: C1,\u000a        p 204]. IMI's input contributed to the view in the report [C2]\u000a      that migration should be conceptualised as a human freedom or capability\u000a      (Section 1.3 in particular reflects the views expressed in [R8]),\u000a      that migration is an intrinsic part of broader processes of human\u000a      development, and that such development processes generally lead to higher\u000a      levels of migration and mobility, rather than the conventional wisdom that\u000a      development will lead to less migration (for instance p 24, including\u000a      footnotes 9 and 10).\u000a    On the basis of this research on migration and development [R2, R9],\u000a      Oliver Bakewell was invited to attend and prepare a background paper for\u000a      the European Commission roundtable on `The Role of Migration in\u000a      Development Strategies' held in Brussels on 30 January 2013, as part of\u000a      the EU's preparations for the UN High-level Dialogue on Migration and\u000a      Development. He emphasised two particular issues that need to be\u000a      addressed: (i) improving the understanding of the relationship between\u000a      urbanisation and migration; and, (ii) reworking the conception of\u000a      development to take account of mobility. These points were both picked up\u000a      in the subsequent European Commission Communication [C3, pp 3, 9, and\u000a        14] that set out the common position of the EU and member states at\u000a      the High-level Dialogue and proposed future directions for the EU's work\u000a      on migration and development [C4].\u000a    Migration and global environmental change\u000a    In 2012, IMI's new research insights, put forward during a project\u000a      workshop and through a commissioned background paper [C6], had a\u000a      significant influence on the UK government's Foresight report on\u000a        Migration and Environmental Change [C5]. The Foresight\u000a      report is widely recognised as an agenda-setting publication in its field\u000a      that has changed the terms of the debate. This Foresight report was\u000a      ground-breaking in challenging conventional views on its topic, and\u000a      mitigating ideas that global warming will lead to massive international\u000a      migration. The IMI background study on the environmental and\u000a      non-environmental drivers of migration had a major influence on the main\u000a      report that led to new assessments of the effects of climate change and\u000a      environmental migration.\u000a    IMI research contributed to the development of this vision with its new\u000a      conceptualisation of migration and insight into how capabilities (as\u000a      defined above) impact climate-induced migration [C5, p 32, 62].IMI\u000a      countered the common view that environmental degradation will lead to\u000a      large- scale migration [C5, pp 9, 102] and stressed that the key\u000a      factors explaining the relationship between environmental stress and\u000a      migration are the vulnerability of people and their capability to adapt to\u000a      environmental change [C5, pp 2, 13]. A representative of the UK\u000a      government's Office for Science [C6] wrote in an email to Hein de\u000a      Haas: `Your views on climate change and migration have, as I hope you\u000a      know, already deeply influenced the Foresight report - for example, your\u000a      points on how those most affected by environmental change are often likely\u000a      to be those least likely to be able to cross international borders, and so\u000a      on.'\u000a    Global Migration Futures: Drivers, processes and scenarios of\u000a        migration futures\u000a    The new insights generated by IMI research into the links between\u000a      migration and broader development processes [R1, R8, R9] were\u000a      channelled towards larger audiences of practitioners and migration\u000a      policy-makers through the GMF project. The project's scenario-building\u000a      workshops in The Hague and Cairo involved more than 40 migration experts\u000a      and stakeholders from businesses, governments, and civil society across 17\u000a      countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Oceania and America.\u000a      Representatives were present from prominent international organisations\u000a      such as the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), UNHCR, WHO,\u000a      the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Global\u000a      Climate Adaptation Partnership as well as government officials.\u000a      Participants stated that the workshops and IMI's research insights helped\u000a      them to develop a more realistic and longer-term vision on migration\u000a      futures. This resulted in demand from governments and NGOs to apply the\u000a      IMI Migration Scenarios Methodology in other regions.\u000a    In 2012, the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat (RMMS), a Nairobi-based\u000a      independent agency committed to promoting forward thinking and policy\u000a      development within the migration sector in the Horn of Africa and Yemen,\u000a      contracted IMI to apply the scenario approach to the Horn of Africa. It\u000a      recognised that future migration within the region was likely to be\u000a      affected by many factors that remained very uncertain and felt that a\u000a      scenarios workshop could introduce valuable new insights to those\u000a      designing policy [C7]. Also in 2012, a report on Pacific migration\u000a      prepared for New Zealand's Department of Labour and Australia's Department\u000a      of Immigration and Citizenship recommended working with IMI in its\u000a      conclusions: `Our understanding of the changing Pacific migration trends\u000a      can be enhanced through further research especially the use of futures\u000a      scenario based modelling developed by the Oxford University-based\u000a      International Migration Institute' [C8 p ix; see also pp 5, 84-6].\u000a      As a result, the Australian and New Zealand governments, with support from\u000a      UNESCO, sponsored a scenarios exercise run by IMI.\u000a    Both workshops included a broad range of experts and stakeholders,\u000a      including senior government officials, business people and representatives\u000a      from international organisations and civil society from across the\u000a      regions. This commitment of funds and time from senior staff is evidence\u000a      of the value placed on IMI's scenario approach. One participant at the\u000a      Pacific workshop held in Auckland in October 2012 commented, `I learnt so\u000a      much from the Scenarios planning, and have certainly applied some of the\u000a      techniques ... in some of my practical problem-solving with Pacific\u000a      counterparts and New Zealand employers over the last few months here in\u000a      the RSE [Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme]'. [C9]\u000a    The project has also generated many requests for the researchers to talk\u000a      to civil servants and policy-makers about the innovative scenario\u000a      methodology (particularly because of its unconventional methodological\u000a      focus on the systematic exploration of uncertain factors affecting current\u000a      and future migration) and its use in examining and planning for future\u000a      migration. Simona Vezzoli has been invited for the past three years to\u000a      teach scenario-building at an annual International Labour Organisation\u000a      (ILO) workshop in Turin, attended by civil servants; she has also been\u000a      asked by IOM to review their Migration and Development teaching modules\u000a      for practitioners, which will be reported back to the High-level Dialogue\u000a      on Migration and Development, General Assembly 2013. In May 2013, the EU\u000a      presidency invited Hein de Haas to present insights from the GMF project\u000a      at the European Migration Network (EMN) Annual Conference 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Oxford's International Migration Institute (IMI) on the\u000a      driving forces of global migration processes, conducted in conversation\u000a      with international stakeholder groups, has significantly affected the ways\u000a      in which migration is conceptualised and viewed by experts, international\u000a      organisations and governments involved in formulating migration and\u000a      development policies. The new perspective arising from IMI's research\u000a      fundamentally challenges the common assumption that migration is driven by\u000a      poverty and distress, and holds that migration is in fact an integral part\u000a      of the process of human and economic development.

Governmental and non-governmental stakeholders\u000a      in the GMF project have helped to guide the Oxford research into how\u000a      future processes of socioeconomic, political, cultural, technological, and\u000a      environmental transformation will affect migration.\u000a    In particular, IMI research has challenged common assumptions that\u000a      international (particularly `South-North') migration is primarily driven\u000a      by underdevelopment, poverty, and other forms of distress. IMI researchers\u000a      have found that a minimum level of capability (ie resources, skills,\u000a      networks etc) and aspiration is necessary for migration to occur.\u000a      Consequently, the poorest often migrate less and, paradoxically, processes\u000a      of human and economic development typically lead to increased migration [R4].\u000a      These assumptions also underlie the common notion that climate change and\u000a      environmental stress will lead to mass migration. IMI research has\u000a      highlighted that environmental disruption and poverty are actually more\u000a      likely to undermine people's ability to migrate [R6] and, again\u000a      paradoxically, that migration can actually help people to cope\u000a      successfully with external stresses by providing alternative income\u000a      sources [R2, R3].\u000a    IMI's GMF project has introduced these important theoretical insights to\u000a      the policy world by applying them within a new Migration Scenario\u000a      Methodology that has been adapted from the business sector and transformed\u000a      into both an exploratory and participatory research methodology. It\u000a      engages a wide range of migration experts and stakeholders (from\u000a      government, international organisations, NGOs and the private sector) to\u000a      reflect critically on the drivers of past change, on factors that are\u000a      reasonably certain to change in the future, and on factors that are\u000a      uncertain for the future but which may have a profound influence on\u000a      international migration [R7]. IMI's Migration Scenario Methodology\u000a      has been highly successful, being adopted by governments, academic\u000a      institutions and NGOs in Europe, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and the\u000a      Pacific to study how future development processes will affect migration in\u000a      often rather non-intuitive ways. The innovation of this approach lies in\u000a      the direct application of new theoretical insights on the drivers of\u000a      migration generated by other IMI research projects during the\u000a      scenario-building process. Sharing these insights facilitates stakeholder\u000a      learning and network-building, and the identification of new research and\u000a      policy insights about future international migration takes place during\u000a      the scenario- building process.\u000a    Most migration futures work has been based on linear extrapolations of\u000a      recent and more certain trends. However, future changes are highly\u000a      unlikely to follow such linear patterns due to the uncertainty of external\u000a      economic, political and social factors. The identification of key future\u000a      migration drivers in a highly uncertain context informs the development of\u000a      GMF's migration scenarios, which push experts and stakeholders to think\u000a      longer-term and to change their visions of future economic, social,\u000a      political and demographic trends affecting migration. By making\u000a      governments aware that migration changes may occur in unexpected and\u000a      counterintuitive ways, the process equips them to design migration\u000a      policies that can increase the benefits and reduce the costs of migration.\u000a      IMI has facilitated four workshops with policy-makers using this\u000a      methodology in order to ensure a dynamic interaction between researchers\u000a      and users. The first two were initiated by IMI using project funds; the\u000a      last two were held in response to demand for IMI's methodology (see\u000a      Section 4).\u000a    The following staff contributed to this programme of research:\u000a    \u000a      Professor Stephen Castles, Director (2006-09), Honorary Associate\u000a        (2009-present)\u000a      Professor Robin Cohen, Director (2009-11)\u000a      Dr Hein de Haas, Research Officer (2006-11), Co-director\u000a        (2011-present)\u000a      Dr Oliver Bakewell, Research Officer (2006-11), Co-director\u000a        (2011-present)\u000a      Dr Emanuela Paoletti, Research Assistant (2010), Research Officer\u000a        (2010-12)\u000a      Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, Research Officer (2009-10)\u000a      Ms Simona Vezzoli, Research Assistant (2008-10), Research Officer\u000a        (2010-present)\u000a      Ms Ayla Bonfiglio, Research Assistant (2010-11), Research Officer\u000a        (2012-13)\u000a      Ms Gunvor J&#243;nsson, Research Assistant (2008-11)\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14580","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The direct beneficiaries of the research were organisations with a public\u000d\u000a      voice on the ethical use of, and regulation on, body parts for\u000d\u000a      reproduction and medicine: specifically the Nuffield Council on Bioethics\u000d\u000a      (NCOB), and indirectly the Welsh Assembly, the UK-wide Human Fertilisation\u000d\u000a      and Embryology Authority (HEFA). In turn, their work has had significant\u000d\u000a      impact on public understanding and debate (on egg donors and recipients in\u000d\u000a      particular), and through this on health and well-being.\u000d\u000a    The research underpinning the impact was subsequently disseminated to\u000d\u000a      such organisations through their direct involvement with the research\u000d\u000a      conducted (including their attendance at events designed to develop\u000d\u000a      consensus definitions), through Strathern's role as Chair of the NCOB\u000d\u000a      Working Party, and through McDonald's evidence to that Working Party;\u000d\u000a      wider dissemination has occurred through publication, the sharing of best\u000d\u000a      practice, and the media.\u000d\u000a    As confirmed by the NCOB: \u000d\u000a        \"Marilyn [Strathern] was appointed as Chair to the Working Party because\u000d\u000a        of her academic reputation, particularly in connection with her\u000d\u000a        anthropological work on new reproductive technologies and on gift\u000d\u000a        relationships.\"(a)\u000d\u000a    In 2011 the NCOB Working Party produced a report, Human bodies:\u000d\u000a        donation for medicine and research(b), which set out\u000d\u000a      guidance to help professionals and others consider the ethical\u000d\u000a      acceptability of various ways of encouraging people to donate, both for\u000d\u000a      treatment of others and for scientific research.\u000d\u000a    Whilst the NCOB report was the result of the collective discussion and\u000d\u000a      opinion of the Working Party, their overall analytical approach to the\u000d\u000a      work was shaped by Strathern in particular Strathern's guidance on the use\u000d\u000a      of comparative analysis (referred to as \"analogies\" below) was\u000d\u000a      essential.\u000d\u000a    The Final Report also more directly reflects engagement with Strathern\u000d\u000a      and McDonald's research. For example, the guide to the full report\u000d\u000a      highlights sections on international comparisons and conceptual issues\u000d\u000a      around uses of money in the context of donation, and argues that it is\u000d\u000a      possible to compensate donors without donations becoming purchases, as\u000d\u000a      well as consider alternatives.(d) The full Final Report makes\u000d\u000a      extensive use of concepts and ideas developed by Strathern (e.g. 2002),\u000d\u000a      including sections on: comparison and analogies, discussion of money in\u000d\u000a      context of ethical choice, gift relationship, relational thinking (public\u000d\u000a      and private) and the issue of altruism.\u000d\u000a    As summarised in a letter by the NCOB on Professor Strathern's\u000d\u000a      contribution:\"Marilyn's role was crucial... both through her highly\u000d\u000a        facilitative and inclusive chairing...and because of her own\u000d\u000a        intellectual contribution to the thinking and analysis that underpinned\u000d\u000a        the practical recommendations made in the report.\u000d\u000a    The following areas of analysis in the report derived almost\u000d\u000a        exclusively from Marilyn's input:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the use of analogies across a wide range of forms of donation and\u000d\u000a          volunteering, and in particular between the donation of eggs and\u000d\u000a          volunteering to participate in a first-in-human trial (see Box 1.8 in\u000d\u000a          Chapter 1 of the report);\u000d\u000a      the distinctions between various forms of payment: `purchase' of a\u000d\u000a          thing; `reward' to a person; and `recompense' of a person (see figure\u000d\u000a          2 on p71 of the report);\u000d\u000a      the analysis of the gift relationship (paragraphs 4.9 - 4.14); and\u000d\u000a      the analysis of the role of money, and the very different meanings\u000d\u000a          assigned to money in different contexts (paragraphs 4.15 - 4.16 and\u000d\u000a          box 4.4).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These four areas of analysis were essential in reaching our\u000d\u000a        conclusions as to what role various forms of payment could legitimately\u000d\u000a        play in promoting various forms of donation...\"(a)\u000d\u000a    In addition, McDonald's research was used in evidence to the Working\u000d\u000a      Party (c), drawing on Lambert and McDonald (2009). McDonald's\u000d\u000a      evidence focused on relational thinking and the need for future policy and\u000d\u000a      guidance to take account of different perspectives on bodies and parts,\u000d\u000a      and the context in which decisions were made. Strathern's work on\u000d\u000a      surrogacy and money shaped the Working Party's position on compensation,\u000d\u000a      and this subsequently fed into policy (see below 7) Following publication\u000d\u000a      of the NCOB Report in 2011, Strathern helped disseminate the findings to\u000d\u000a      the public and other stakeholders through the media. There was wide media\u000d\u000a      coverage of the Report's concerns. In the context of organ donation for\u000d\u000a      example, one BBC article attracted 371 comments before the discussion\u000d\u000a      closed.(d)\u000d\u000a    As well as informing public understanding and debate in this way, the\u000d\u000a      Report also influenced both practice and guidance. (Full details appear in\u000d\u000a      the NCOB's 28-page summary of the Report's impact one year after\u000d\u000a      publication).(e) The clearest example of a direct impact on\u000d\u000a      practice is the adoption of the NCOB Report's recommendation by The Human\u000d\u000a        Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the UK-wide regulator\u000d\u000a      which oversees the use of gametes and embryos in fertility treatment and\u000d\u000a      research, as reported by the NCOB:\u000d\u000a    \"The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority today decided that\u000d\u000a        women who donate their eggs for others' treatment should be compensated\u000d\u000a        &#163;750 per cycle, and that sperm donors should be compensated &#163;35 per\u000d\u000a        clinic visit.\u000d\u000a    \"The [NCOB] Council recommended in its recent report `Human bodies:\u000d\u000a        donation for medicine and research' that lost earnings should be fully\u000d\u000a        reimbursed for those donating eggs or sperm for others' treatment, so\u000d\u000a        that they are not left out of pocket. The Council specifically\u000d\u000a        recommended that the cap of &#163;250 on recovery of lost earnings for egg\u000d\u000a        and sperm donors should be removed.\"(f)\u000d\u000a    (Further, according to the Independent (20-10-2011)\"The decision\u000d\u000a        followed a two-year review, including a public consultation, of the\u000d\u000a        medical, social and ethical issues.\"(g))\u000d\u000a    In turn, the change in practice has improved health and well-being.\u000d\u000a      According to a survey of fertility clinics carried out by The\u000d\u000a        Telegraph in November 2012(h) &#8212; official HFEA data are\u000d\u000a      not yet available - more women donated eggs as a result of the change in\u000d\u000a      payments and \"waiting lists have now halved\". Shorter waiting lists\u000d\u000a      mean that women are less likely to seek assistance abroad (and thereby\u000d\u000a      incurring greater cost and risk to health where assisted reproduction is\u000d\u000a      less regulated).\u000d\u000a    The significance to this to those who rely on egg donations is\u000d\u000a      illustrated by one recipient quoted in The Guardian in 2012: \"I think\u000d\u000a        of my donor every day...Our donor didn't just bring joy into our lives,\u000d\u000a        but into the lives of everyone who means the most to us\".(i)\u000d\u000a    In terms of influencing guidance, the NCOB gave evidence to the National\u000d\u000a      Assembly for Wales Health and Social Care Committee on the Human\u000d\u000a        Transplantation (Wales) Bill based on the Report.\u000d\u000a    The Working Party Report has also been used by the International\u000d\u000a        Society for Stem Cell Research to inform the discussion of their\u000d\u000a      recent position paper,(j) using the report to argue that\u000d\u000a      commercial transactions `are ethically highly controversial' but\u000d\u000a      compensation is not.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research in the Department of Social Anthropology concerning the ethics\u000d\u000a      of the use of biotechnology has had an impact on organisations with a\u000d\u000a      public voice on the ethical use and regulation of body parts for\u000d\u000a      reproduction and medicine, such as the Nuffield Council on Bioethics\u000d\u000a      (NCOB), and indirectly the Welsh Assembly, the UK-wide Human Fertilisation\u000d\u000a      and Embryology Authority (HEFA).

Consequently there is a need to balance these\u000d\u000a      differences in policy and practice.\u000d\u000a    Comparison with assisted reproduction showed that conceptual issues\u000d\u000a      pertinent to ethics and regulation are shared with transplantation; the\u000d\u000a      boundary between \"natural\" and \"social\" becomes blurred, roles and states\u000d\u000a      normally taken for granted are challenged, and the issue of \"giving\"\u000d\u000a      becomes problematic.(5,6) These conceptual issues have\u000d\u000a      important practical consequences for regulation and management of human\u000d\u000a      body parts.\u000d\u000a    Key findings and insights from the research include:\u000d\u000a    (1) identification of different potential policy solutions based on\u000d\u000a      McDonald's comparative research\u000d\u000a    (2) recognition of the importance of cultural context to such solutions\u000d\u000a      being meaningful and\/or appropriate\u000d\u000a    (3) the importance of individual altruism to donation of body\u000d\u000a      parts in the UK context\u000d\u000a    (4) the recognition that this does not necessary preclude payment or\u000d\u000a      development of other incentives where it is viewed as compensation\u000d\u000a      to donors.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14581","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"49518","Name":"Rwanda"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"433561","Name":"Burundi"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Advising the Monetary Policy Committee on food prices and inflation\u000a        dynamics\u000a    Rising inflation and the challenge of implementing an effective monetary\u000a      policy in the face of\u000a      increased volatility in world food and fuel prices have recently emerged\u000a      as major concerns for\u000a      policy-makers in Tanzania and for the Bank of Tanzania in particular.\u000a    The team's work on food price dynamics and the transmission of monetary\u000a      policy [R5, R6], was\u000a      initially discussed at internal and public seminars hosted by the Bank of\u000a      Tanzania in 2011 [see\u000a        Section 5: C1].\u000a    As a result of the exposure of his research, Christopher Adam was\u000a      subsequently invited to present\u000a      his research findings to a High-level Policy Dialogue meeting of East\u000a      African central bank\u000a      governors and advisors hosted by the African Development Bank in Nairobi\u000a      in February 2012 and\u000a      to edit a special issue of the African Development Bank's Research\u000a      Bulletin on Inflation in East\u000a        Africa.\u000a    Based on this research, Christopher Adam was then invited to make a\u000a      presentation on inflation\u000a      dynamics to the August 2011 meeting of the Bank of Tanzania Monetary\u000a      Policy Committee (MPC),\u000a      the first time an external speaker has been asked to address the\u000a      committee. In response to\u000a      specific follow-on requests from the governor of the bank, he made further\u000a      presentations in\u000a      February 2012 and May 2013 to assist the committee in analysing the\u000a      inflationary consequences\u000a      of, and the monetary policy response to, changes in domestic and\u000a      international energy prices [C2].\u000a    Based on these presentations, Christopher Adam (for the IGC) has\u000a      subsequently been working\u000a      with Bank of Tanzania research department staff to produce the bi-monthly\u000a      Inflation Report for the\u000a      MPC [C3]. Reports of this kind were pioneered by the Bank of\u000a      England and other leading central\u000a      banks and are core components of the new framework for the conduct of\u000a      monetary policy being\u000a      developed by the Bank of Tanzania. It is anticipated that as the Bank of\u000a      Tanzania's own capacity\u000a      strengthens, it will take over full responsibility for the Inflation\u000a        Report [C1].\u000a    Exchange rate policy and the transition to monetary union\u000a    At their summit in 2007, the heads of state of the EAC (Kenya, Uganda,\u000a      Tanzania, Rwanda and\u000a      Burundi) committed themselves to move with all deliberate speed towards\u000a      monetary union.\u000a      Charged with the role of advising the heads of state on the economic\u000a      implications of monetary\u000a      union in the region, the Monetary Affairs Committee of the EAC, comprising\u000a      the central bank\u000a      governors of the five partner states, invited the IGC-Tanzania led by\u000a      Christopher Adam to act as\u000a      one of their five lead advisers. The other invited advisers were the IMF,\u000a      the African Development\u000a      Bank, the Bank of England and the Riksbank of Sweden. IGC-Tanzania was\u000a      asked to be the lead\u000a      advisor on `Exchange Rate Arrangements in the Transition to East African\u000a      Monetary Union'. The\u000a      research report outlining its recommendations is listed above [R7].\u000a    Five options for exchange rate policy during the transition towards\u000a      monetary union were examined\u000a      by the researchers. As recent developments in Europe have highlighted, the\u000a      challenges of\u000a      monetary union with incomplete fiscal union are significant and these are\u000a      compounded in East\u000a      Africa by the limited integration of goods and factor markets and by\u000a      emerging structural tensions\u000a      being exposed by large-scale oil and gas discoveries in some EAC\u000a      countries. The researchers\u000a      therefore advised (contrary to earlier advice from the European Central\u000a      Bank) that EAC countries\u000a      should maintain their current inflation-anchors (ie moderately managed\u000a      floats) during the possibly\u000a      attenuated convergence phase towards monetary union. Only when a viable\u000a      level of (political and\u000a      fiscal) convergence is achieved should the authorities move to an exchange\u000a      rate grid as a prelude\u000a      to establishing irrevocable conversion rates to the new currency. The\u000a      researchers recommended\u000a      that during this transition, partner states should develop strategies that\u000a      exploit the benefits of\u000a      greater integration and coordination in the monetary sphere but should not\u000a      prematurely commit the\u000a      countries to difficult-to-reverse steps to full monetary union.\u000a    Drafts of the research paper and policy recommendations [R7, C4]\u000a      were discussed by Partner\u000a      State central bank governors at meetings of the MAC between December 2010\u000a      and April 2012.\u000a      These recommendations were endorsed in full by governors and formally\u000a      submitted to the High-level Task Force of the East African Community\u000a      Secretariat in May 2012 [C5]. The task force is\u000a      responsible for liaison with heads of state and for the eventual\u000a      preparation of the protocol for\u000a      negotiating monetary union in the region. The protocol is effectively East\u000a      Africa's Maastricht Treaty.\u000a      The recommendations were incorporated into the draft protocol in November\u000a      2012 and approved\u000a      by EAC heads of state in Kigali on 23 February 2013 [C6]. The\u000a      final protocol is expected to be\u000a      published for ratification by partner states in late 2013 or early 2014.\u000a      Thanks to his research and\u000a      existing impact, Christopher Adam continues to advise Bank of Tanzania\u000a      representatives on the\u000a      High-level Task Force.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Oxford by members of the International Growth Centre (IGC),\u000a      funded by the Economic\u000a      and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Department for International\u000a      Development (DFID),\u000a      has played an important role in shaping two key areas of monetary and\u000a      exchange rate policy\u000a      formulation in East Africa.\u000a    Research on food prices and inflation in Tanzania is providing\u000a      the technical basis for the\u000a      discussions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of\u000a      Tanzania, and has contributed\u000a      to current thinking by the African Development Bank (ADB) on policy\u000a      responses to global food\u000a      price volatility in East Africa.\u000a    Work on exchange rate policy has helped shape the Draft Protocol\u000a      on East African Monetary Union\u000a      currently being negotiated between the East African Community (EAC)\u000a      partner states (Kenya,\u000a      Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi).\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"184745","Name":"Nairobi"},{"GeoNamesId":"202061","Name":"Kigali"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[R1] Buffie, E, C S Adam, S O'Connell and C Pattillo (2008)\u000a      `Riding the Wave: Monetary\u000a      Responses to Aid Surges in Low-Income Countries'.

The mission of the IGC is\u000a      to promote sustainable growth in developing countries by providing\u000a      demand-led policy advice\u000a      based on frontier research. Christopher Adam is the research director for\u000a      the Tanzanian country\u000a      programme and coordinator of the IGC's work on regional macroeconomic\u000a      issues in East Africa.\u000a    The research highlights the central role of: the volatility of domestic\u000a      production, particularly in\u000a      agriculture, and of external trade conditions; the absence of deep\u000a      domestic asset markets and the\u000a      consequent widespread prevalence of credit rationing; and low and\/or\u000a      limited policy credibility [See\u000a        Section 3: R1, R2]. The researchers develop analytical models with\u000a      these features to explore how\u000a      conventional monetary, exchange rate and fiscal policy rules require\u000a      modification for low-income\u000a      countries. This analysis suggests, among other things, that when the\u000a      fiscal and monetary\u000a      authorities have a reasonable degree of credibility &#8212; as is arguably the\u000a      case in Africa at present &#8212;\u000a      the thinness of domestic debt markets means central banks should run a\u000a      much more managed\u000a      exchange rate policy than would be suggested by conventional models\u000a      calibrated to OECD or\u000a      middle-income\/emerging market structures. This body of research has been\u000a      published in leading\u000a      economics journals [R1-R4].\u000a    This analytical research has been supplemented more recently by detailed\u000a      empirical analysis on\u000a      monetary policy and inflation in Tanzania [R5, R6]. Since the\u000a      mid-1990s, Tanzania has adopted a\u000a      floating exchange rate with a money-targets approach as its chosen anchor\u000a      for inflation. Whilst this\u000a      has worked well in the past, there are concerns that financial innovation\u000a      and an increasingly open\u000a      capital account are undermining the efficacy of this approach to inflation\u000a      control, and that the\u000a      authorities should be moving to a conventional inflation-targeting regime.\u000a    This empirical research on the monetary transmission mechanism and the\u000a      structural determinants\u000a      of inflation in Tanzania suggest that such policy stances may have\u000a      unanticipated negative\u000a      consequences. The research continues to evolve both with the IGC in\u000a      Tanzania and through direct\u000a      collaboration with staff from the IMF research department under the aegis\u000a      of the DFID-IMF\u000a      programme Macroeconomic Research in Low-income Countries, which\u000a      commenced in the second\u000a      half of 2012.

This\u000a      rural population is vulnerable; twice in ten years the 700,000 herders of\u000a      Mongolia, one-third of the population, have suffered the effects of\u000a      extreme winters (-45&#186;C), and this has resulted in some losing 100% of\u000a      their herds.\u000a    By examining and comparing the effects and outcomes of different policies\u000a      for the management of pastoralism, and providing empirically-based\u000a      recommendations, the research has benefited supranational agencies and\u000a        national policymakers in Inner Asia responsible for pastoral management\u000a        and reform, and has also led directly to the establishment in\u000a        2008 of the charity, CAMDA, which has provided direct aid to\u000a        pastoralists.\u000a    The research has been disseminated through reports and publications in\u000a      Mongolian, Russian, Chinese and English, and informed international policy\u000a      debates; it was cited, for example, by the Committee for the 2009 Nobel\u000a      Prize for Economic Governance.(1) Dissemination has included\u000a      public lectures, debates with key stakeholders and involvement in\u000a      international governmental discussion (e.g. Sneath was invited to address\u000a      the Intergovernmental UK-Mongolia Round Table 13 March 2008 in Mongolia).\u000a    Direct beneficiaries of the outcomes of Humphrey's and Sneath's research\u000a      on pastoralism in Inner Asia have been those supranational agencies which\u000a      aim to reduce poverty and support sustainable development, such as the\u000a      World Bank,(2) the United Nations Food and Agricultural\u000a      Organisation (FAO)(3) and Development Programme (UNDP).(4)\u000a      All cite this research in their advisory reports on policy oriented\u000a      towards improving the sustainability of pastoralism in Inner Asia, in\u000a      particular cultural norms, livelihoods and land-use, and the role of\u000a      mobility respectively.\u000a    The significance of the research to such bodies is attested, for example,\u000a      by a senior World Bank official: \"I can confidently say that [Sneath's]\u000a        work with Carrie Humphrey ... on Mongolian pastoralism over the last two\u000a        decades, has been influential in shaping the approach of the World Bank\u000a        and other donors (e.g. SDC, IFAD, FAO, UNDP) in supporting pastoral\u000a        livelihoods, pasture land and risk management in contemporary Mongolia.\"(5)\u000a    The influence of the research on policy makers within the area has also\u000a      been confirmed by national stakeholders. In Mongolia, for example, the\u000a      Chairman of the Governing Board of the Rural Investment Support Centre NGO\u000a      made specific reference to The End of Nomadism (1999) and Sneath's\u000a      1998 Science paper as being \"highly influential and widely\u000a        cited in the literature that policy makers... have drawn upon when\u000a        developing policies towards pastoralists and environment in Mongolia\".(6)\u000a         The Chairman of the Mongolian Government's Animal Husbandry\u000a      Policy Implementation Regulation Office has stated that the The End of\u000a        Nomadism research \"has directly influenced Pasture Land\u000a        Utilization Law to be discussed during the Mongolian Parliament Spring\u000a        session\".(7)\u000a    Direct evidence of impact in China, and to a lesser extent Russia, is\u000a      limited due to the nature of policy making in these countries. Despite the\u000a      bias in published evidence, the advisor to the UNDP stated that \"the\u000a        work has influenced thinking on grassland policy in Mongolia and China\"\u000a      (Russia being outside his areas of expertise). However, he added\u000a      that \"In China the findings are used to support opposition to current\u000a        practices (see Ecology and Society paper [China's Grassland Contract\u000a        Policy and its Impacts on Herder Ability to Benefit in Inner Mongolia:\u000a        Tragic Feedbacks], 2011)\".(8)\u000a    Humphrey and Sneath's research has also helped to establish a research\u000a      methodology which has directly influenced international government policy.\u000a      The Director of the Analysis Centre of the Government of Buryatia (Russia)\u000a      stated in a letter of June 2012: \"the use of the methods realised in\u000a        your project ...makes possible a proper evaluation of ongoing\u000a        socio-economic processes and enables the results of the project to be\u000a        taken up into practical actions.\" (9) One practical\u000a      action being undertaken in Buryatia which reflects the recommendations\u000a      made by Humphrey and Sneath is the reintroduction of indigenous cattle\u000a      (from China) lost since collectivisation.(10)\u000a    The research has also led to direct aid provided though an NGO, Cambridge\u000a      Mongolia Development Appeal (CAMDA). CAMDA has provided over &#163;200,000 in\u000a      direct aid to Mongolian pastoral households since 2008.

These changes were accompanied by significant\u000a      increases in human and herd populations and also by increased\u000a      desertification and pastoral degradation.\u000a    The research involved collaboration with four research institutes and\u000a      universities across Inner Asia (Mongolian Research Institute of Animal\u000a      Husbandry; Baikal Institute for Natural Resource Management, Buryatia;\u000a      Xinjiang Normal University; and Inner Mongolia Normal University), each of\u000a      which contributed a senior adviser and one or two researchers to aid in\u000a      the comparison of twelve sites across the grassland regions of China,\u000a      Russia and Mongolia.ii &amp; vi\u000a    By examining historical materials in the wider political economy of\u000a      pastoralism, the study helped explain the unexpected turns found in the\u000a      post-collective era and identified lessons for future practice. In\u000a      particular, the research showed that several key assumptions about\u000a      pastoral economic change were not supported empirically &#8212; with\u000a      implications for policy and practice. For example, it challenged Western\u000a      assumptions about the \"tragedy of the commons\" and the \"inevitable\"\u000a      destructive environmental and cultural consequences of collectivisation,\u000a      as well as the presumption that privatisation would have positive impact.\u000a      i, ii, iii &amp; v\u000a    The research showed that one effect of the \"free market\" privatisation of\u000a      livestock and individualisation of land use had been a reduction in the\u000a      amount of movement undertaken by many pastoral households, with\u000a      significant negative impacts. In regions (such as Mongolia and Tuva\u000a      [Russia]) where land use most closely resembled earlier pre-socialist\u000a      practices &#8212; and where the collectives made fewest changes to earlier\u000a      patterns and kept, or even enhanced, pastoral mobility for certain types\u000a      of herds &#8212; the research found relatively good environmental conditions;\u000a      the same was found to be true for districts in China that had retained\u000a      State Farms. Regions with high herd mobility had significantly lower\u000a      reported levels of pastoral degradation than those with fenced household\u000a      pastures (China) or static, highly mechanised agro-industrial techniques\u000a      (Russia), introduced to support more productive European breeds. These\u000a      required processed fodder produced by ploughing up fragile grassland\u000a      areas, resulting in widespread degradation. i, ii, iii, v &amp; vi\u000a    The research also showed that with modern technical support, the mobility\u000a      of herds remained compatible with desired social development that involved\u000a      most of the population being settled in villages (for access to schools,\u000a      services, communications, etc.) ii &amp; iv\u000a    The study's main conclusion was that sustainable pastoralism in Inner\u000a      Asia could not be achieved without retaining livestock mobility; and that\u000a      larger-scale collaborative land use, in combination with other forms of\u000a      organisation and technical support, should be central to management\u000a      policies.i, ii, iii In addition, it recommended that native\u000a      breeds could support more sustainable herding.ii, v &amp; vi\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14583","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research led by Mascie-Taylor, and the pilot projects assessing the\u000a      effectiveness of different interventions (both in the short and long\u000a      term), have had direct impact on a number of organisations who support\u000a      public health in Bangladesh, including the Government of Bangladesh (GoB),\u000a      the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank. The research has\u000a      led to the development and implementation of new policy and public\u000a        health interventions, and this has in turn improved the health\u000a        and well-being of Bangladeshi poor.\u000a    The research was disseminated through a one-day conference in 1997\u000a      attended by key personnel from the World Bank, WHO, the Ministry of Health\u000a      and Family Welfare (GoB) and the Directorate General of Health Services\u000a      (GoB) as well as through a detailed report (a).

The following statement at the end of this research paper, `As\u000a        a result of this research, the Government of Bangladesh has proposed\u000a        that simple messages on the importance of hand washing before food\u000a        preparation, regular nail trimming and wearing of shoes should be given\u000a        at the time of mass chemotherapy as part of its health service delivery\u000a        strategy.' makes it clear that this research has had a direct\u000a      influence on the Government of Bangladesh's approach to public health and\u000a      indeed, this has resulted in a new public health programme.\u000a    This recommendation was initially taken forward by the setting up of a Global\u000a        Hand Washing Day initiative which was organised by the Global Public\u000a      Private Partnership on Hand Washing in October 2008. In that year more\u000a      than 14.4 million Bangladeshi children from nearly 73,000 schools joined\u000a      in this event, pledging to promote hand washing with soap after using the\u000a      toilet and before eating.(c)\u000a    This impact has been sustained in subsequent years; each October up to 18\u000a      million school children (about 50% of all school aged children in\u000a      Bangladesh) participate in an annual event, with discussions and\u000a      demonstrations about using soap. In addition, messages are sent to Imams\u000a      of the Islamic Foundation and journalists of the Press Clubs, and (via\u000a      SMS) to 10,000 Community Hygiene Promoters through UNICEF. SMS messages\u000a      are also sent to the general public through mobile companies at the\u000a      request of Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and\u000a      Cooperatives.\u000a    A third recommendation of the report was for an annual mass drug\u000a      administration (MDA) using two drugs in Filariasis-endemic areas of\u000a      Bangladesh using either DEC or ivermectin and albendazole).

Infection can lead to\u000a      significant morbidity and mortality; intestinal parasitic infections are\u000a      associated with undernutrition, poor growth and development,\u000a      iron-deficiency anaemia, decreased physical fitness and work capacity, and\u000a      impaired cognitive function.

This project was\u000a      funded by the WHO and World Bank (see below). and it assessed through a\u000a      randomised community trial the effects of (a) deworming alone, (b) health\u000a      education alone and (c) the combined regimen of deworming and health\u000a      education, on parasitic prevalence and intensity as well as nutritional\u000a      status of 2151 children in rural Bangladesh.(3)\u000a    Children either received an anthelmintic drug (albendazole) or a placebo.\u000a      The health educational package (comprising home visits, focus group\u000a      discussions and visits to schools) aimed to\u000a    \u000a      increase awareness of worm transmission and the disabilities caused by\u000a        intestinal helminths\u000a      improve personal hygiene by hand washing before food preparation and\u000a        consumption, and after defecation\u000a      promote regular nail trimming, routine wearing of shoes, use of a\u000a        latrine and use of clean water in cooking and washing of utensils.\u000a    \u000a    Key insights\u000a      The results showed that a single dose of anthelmintic drug led to highly\u000a      significant reductions in prevalence and intensity of infection. Moreover,\u000a      households in the health education areas tended to construct latrines and\u000a      drill tubewells (at their own cost); attitudes to and awareness of\u000a      parasite transmission cycles improved, and shifts in behaviour led to\u000a      improvements in sanitation and personal hygiene; house cleanliness\u000a      improved, and the proportion of children wearing shoes and having trimmed\u000a      nails increased significantly. The combined regimen of deworming and\u000a      health education was associated with greatest reductions in prevalence and\u000a      intensities for all three worms.

Already known to the UNHCR and Ethiopian authorities, having\u000a      played a role in their 1993 decision to move the Uduk refugees from their\u000a      transit camp to a formal refugee scheme at Bonga further inside Ethiopia,\u000a      she then prepared an official Progress Report for this scheme in 1994.\u000a      This was followed by a Community Development consultancy for a Dutch\u000a      organization in 2000. James' work by this time had drawn public attention\u000a      to the fact that the civil war was affecting a large area and population\u000a      within the BN region, not just a few ethnic groups as had previously been\u000a      perceived. In 2003, she was appointed by the UK government to act as a\u000a      Resource Person for the BN in the Sudan peace negotiations in Kenya.\u000a    In 2010, with a small number of other scholars, James was invited to\u000a      present aspects of recent research [R2,R3] to a meeting in Juba,\u000a      southern Sudan, with officials of the UN Mission in Sudan; here she spoke\u000a      specifically on security issues still facing the BN in the aftermath of\u000a      the 2005 peace settlement. This followed a week as tutor on a Rift Valley\u000a      Institute (RVI) field training course, during which she gave seminars on\u000a      the effects of war and displacement for the people of `transitional' areas\u000a      like the BN. The two dozen attendees included senior and junior members of\u000a      development agencies, both Sudanese and international, and several\u000a      diplomats. The Director of the RVI confirms: \"James' original published\u000a      research established a place for the peoples of Blue Nile in the world of\u000a      learning; her documentation of their subsequent fate in Sudan's continuing\u000a      civil wars is an exemplary case of an ethnographer keeping company through\u000a      changing circumstances with the subjects of their research.\"[Section 5:\u000a        C1]\u000a    Building on this long-term impact and the wide reach and reputation of\u000a      her academic work, James' research has had impact in two further key ways\u000a      since 2011:\u000a    Assisting emergency aid and human rights agencies by improving public\u000a        understanding of the fresh BN crisis\u000a    On South Sudan's secession in July 2011, the UN presence in BN was\u000a      terminated, although demobilization of former fighters was incomplete.\u000a      Within two months, returnees faced aerial and ground attacks. The majority\u000a      crossed the new border to South Sudan; by mid-2013, five new camps had\u000a      been set up there. Within this context, James was contacted by M&#233;decins\u000a          Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) in March 2012, and following\u000a      considerable email correspondence, the Humanitarian Advisor of the Analysis\u000a          &amp; Advocacy Unit in Brussels wrote that she was \"in the\u000a      middle of reading War and Survival with much interest and\u000a      pleasure. We have ordered two copies also for the field teams, as there is\u000a      much interest to understand more about the region and the populations with\u000a      whom we work. This book, and your extensive comments, are a perfect point\u000a      of departure for myself and the teams.\"[C2] As a result of this\u000a      correspondence, James was then invited to speak at a meeting in London for\u000a      MSF staff, including the former MSF Head of Mission for Darfur, and CNN\u000a      journalists (circa 30 attendees). James' research [R3] was\u000a      welcomed and provoked discussion regarding problems encountered in South\u000a      Sudan's brand-new camps for BN refugees. MSF staff asked (among other\u000a      questions) why there were differences in behaviour between the camps.\u000a      James was able to explain that those in the more southerly camps, like the\u000a      Uduk, had already spent a generation as refugees in Ethiopia, and were\u000a      familiar with all the bureaucratic procedures of the aid world; further\u000a      north, the majority were Ingessana, and had not had the same experience of\u000a      mass exile, nor previous neighbourly contacts with the Maban. A summary of\u000a      James' contributions was included in the MSF newsletter of 21 March 2012.[C3]\u000a    In January 2013, the Danish Demining Group of the Danish\u000a      Refugee Council reported on the new camps in Maban county. In emphasizing\u000a      the cultural history of various BN refugee groups, they drew on an earlier\u000a      report by James on the Uduk for the Minority Rights Group (1995) (www.minorityrights.org\/download.php?id=881c)\u000a      illustrating the relevance of the war years for the new crisis.[C4]\u000a    As the counter-insurgency in BN escalated further in early 2013, several\u000a      high-profile human rights organizations (already well known for work in\u000a      Darfur) undertook investigations on the ground and produced reports: of\u000a      these the most consequential was by Amnesty International. The\u000a      key field investigators came to Oxford to consult James for their\u000a      forthcoming report `\"We had no time to bury them\": War Crimes in Sudan's\u000a      Blue Nile State' [C5], which included local interviews alongside\u000a      satellite photos of bombed villages. They use James' War &amp;\u000a        Survival [R3] as a key source illustrating the roots of the\u000a      new BN conflicts [C5, pp.12, 64]. The lead author of the\u000a      report writes that James' book \"was crucial in establishing a base of\u000a        knowledge ... on the sociopolitical makeup and the history of that\u000a        region.... Her command of local languages provided unmatched insight...\u000a        Her description of past conflict patterns ... provided our team with\u000a        important intuitions ... It also sensitized us to local perceptions and\u000a        cultural sensitivities, enabling us to interact with inhabitants of Blue\u000a        Nile in a considerate manner. Upon our return ... we used James' works\u000a        as important reference tools. We were able to check specific testimonies\u000a        against broader historical patterns as described in her works, and to\u000a        locate particular locations mentioned to us by witnesses.\"[C6]\u000a    The Amnesty report has had wide publicity, their office recently\u000a      mentioning coverage in 41 media sources. The report prompted Lord Alton in\u000a      the House of Lords to ask what assessment the Government had made of the\u000a      situation in the BN, and to demand that the government do more to respond\u000a      to the suffering of the BN people and other victims of Sudanese government\u000a      bombardment.[C7] A further 60-page report by the International\u000a          Crisis Group, `Sudan's spreading conflict (II): War in Blue\u000a      Nile' (2013) also refers to James' 2009 book. [R3; C8, pp. 3,\u000a      33]\u000a    Promoting cultural continuity among Blue Nile refugee communities\u000a    James' research has helped sustain cultural continuity among BN refugees\u000a      in the diaspora. Her multimedia archive project `Voices from the Blue\u000a      Nile' [Section 3] opens up rich research-based materials,\u000a      including video, audio, photographic and cartographic material, to BN\u000a      refugee communities, and to institutions concerned with their welfare. The\u000a      website materials already online, mainly documenting life in the Bonga\u000a      refugee camp, have been effective in promoting cultural continuity and\u000a      historical awareness. For example, Uduk communities in North America\u000a      invited James in 2012 to a Salt Lake City (SLC) Fourth of July reunion of\u000a      Uduk families from across the continent, primarily to talk to the rising\u000a      generation about their history and culture. James' contribution to the\u000a      event included three presentations drawing on her audio-visual archive,\u000a      using materials not yet available on the website. A mentor for the\u000a      expatriate Uduk and Maban community associated with a prominent SLC church\u000a      writes: \"Your Power-Point presentations of the history of the Uduk\u000a        peoples and their village culture were the first view of that era that\u000a        any here had ever seen. We digitally preserved copies of that\u000a        presentation so that their children and their children's schildren shall\u000a        never be deprived of that knowledge... When you... sent me one of the\u000a        two known original Uduk\/Twampa dictionaries, original language primers\u000a        from 1956, and .WAV files of recordings of language and music from the\u000a        1960's... those are priceless!... All of this is being written to DVD's\u000a        so that each refugee family may have copies of this history... Wendy, I\u000a        had never appreciated what could be done with anthropology!...\" [C9]\u000a    It is planned to deposit the original audio and visual materials from\u000a      James' research in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, as a contribution to\u000a      their growing Sudan collections. These will be shared, facilitating\u000a      engagement, with the source community. In a recent illustrated article,\u000a      collaborators Judith Aston and Paul Matthews (UWE) describe their approach\u000a      to further expanding access and participation in curating and using these\u000a      resources, for example by enabling informants to respond to James'\u000a      commentary, and \"to contribute their own recordings to the presentation,\u000a      as a means of extending the narrative.\"[C10] A spontaneous tribute\u000a      from a former refugee to the value of James' work appeared online in 2010:\u000a      \"As a native from southern Blue Nile (Uduk land) I greatly wondered\u000a      whether I will once have information such as Wendy's about my homeland\u000a      stories and events. I am very grateful to those wonderful people scholars\u000a      who have given us a hope to feel and aspire.\"[C11]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    James' ethnographic research on the fortunes of war-displaced communities\u000a      from the Blue Nile region of northern Sudan generated unique insights that\u000a      have been crucial in providing a long-term contribution to the work of the\u000a      United Nations, and to humanitarian agencies assisting Blue Nile refugees:\u000a      firstly, in 2008-11, during their resettlement from Ethiopian camps; and\u000a      secondly, from late 2011 to mid-2013, during their renewed flight, mostly\u000a      over the new border to South Sudan.

Her earlier ethnographic research produced deep\u000a      cultural, historical, and political understandings that enabled her to\u000a      engage in further, applied research during the war years (from the time of\u000a      the first Uduk displacement in 1987 onwards), after the brief peace\u000a      settlement (2005-2011), and following the renewed conflict from late 2011.\u000a      Some of this research was facilitated by various externally funded\u000a      consultancy roles and formal appointments she has undertaken relating to\u000a      the Blue Nile region (henceforth, BN) and its people since 1993, including\u000a      those for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and\u000a      the UK government. For example, during January 1993 she was the consultant\u000a      anthropologist to a TV documentary, set in a transit camp mainly for Uduk\u000a      refugees in Ethiopia. Events encountered there stimulated her initial\u000a      reflections on emotions in history within this community. These were later\u000a      published in two articles, which showed how personal experiences of fear,\u000a      border-crossing, and violence were remembered and how they came to\u000a      re-shape historical events.[Section 3: R1,R2] In addition, between\u000a      2002 and 2013 James made a series of personal visits to Blue Nile\u000a      communities resettled in America, to understand better the wider human\u000a      outcomes of the war years.\u000a    James' research on the region led to the publication of a major book on\u000a      the war years,[R3] accompanied, through collaboration with Dr\u000a      Judith Aston (UWE), by a website based on James' 1994-2000 multimedia\u000a      research materials from Bonga refugee camp in Ethiopia: Voices from\u000a        the Blue Nile.[See Section 3] The book explored not only the\u000a      dynamics of the civil war as it engulfed the BN, with many local\u000a      communities finding their youngsters caught up on both sides of the\u000a      conflict, but also the responses of displaced civilians, their\u000a      uncertainties over returning home, and their keen updating of traditional\u000a      cultural practices. Details concerning the ways in which these changed\u000a      over time in the refugee camps were provided in later articles.[R4,R5]\u000a      James' research subsequently analysed the dilemmas for returnee\u000a      communities resulting from the creation of a new international border\u000a      between North and South Sudan, as compared with the flexibilities of\u000a      border life in past centuries. The secession of South Sudan, in July 2011,\u000a      had left the BN with its returnees inside the North; and the old `safe\u000a      havens' had disappeared. Conflict with national forces resumed almost\u000a      immediately, and large numbers fled again; some back to Ethiopia, but most\u000a      over to Maban county, Upper Nile, in the new state (where they had many\u000a      long-standing contacts).[R6]\u000a\u0009  James' insights and research findings\u000a      went far beyond the usual scope of needs-focused questionnaire surveys.\u000a      She was able to gather personal stories not only of displacement and\u000a      suffering, but of proud participation in the Sudanese civil war.[R1,R2,R3]\u000a      She observed how older forms of family and community life, in the Uduk\u000a      case matrilineal descent groups, were being recreated.[R3] By\u000a      continuing to take audio-visual recordings, she could provide rich\u000a      illustrations of the changes she observed across the fields of\u000a      story-telling, music, song, dance,[R4] together with practices of\u000a      divination and healing,[R5] thereby building up a unique archive of\u000a      cultural change in times of crisis. She was thus able to place current\u000a      events in a longer historical context, and wider geographical setting,\u000a      than would be possible for most agency consultants.[R6]\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15531","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Daniels drew on her original ethnographic research in Japan to develop a\u000d\u000a      2D\/3D model for communicating complex anthropological knowledge to\u000d\u000a      multiple audiences, in an effort to increase public understanding,\u000d\u000a      awareness, and appreciation of Japanese culture.[R7] The\u000d\u000a        Japanese House both advanced academic knowledge (see section 2) and,\u000d\u000a      served as the concept and the catalogue for the exhibition.[R1] As\u000d\u000a      testament to the public appeal of this book, to date 2,500 copies (210 in\u000d\u000a      the Museum shop) have been sold and the book was reprinted nine months\u000d\u000a      after it was first published. The exhibition (2011) had more than 12,000\u000d\u000a      visitors over six months and was accompanied by extensive school and local\u000d\u000a      community outreach programmes, craft workshops, curatorial tours led by\u000d\u000a      Daniels, and study days in which she participated.\u000d\u000a    Educational impact\u000d\u000a    The exhibition [R7] and its associated educational activities\u000d\u000a      have directly increased public knowledge, understanding, awareness and\u000d\u000a      appreciation of Japanese life and culture among individuals from a broad\u000d\u000a      range of ages and backgrounds, through various school, education and\u000d\u000a      community outreach programmes.\u000d\u000a    In total 235 young people attended these sessions (from 8 Primary\u000d\u000a      Schools, 1 Secondary School, 1 Higher Education College, and 1 Special\u000d\u000a      Educational Needs school). 374 people attended the Adult Education and\u000d\u000a      Learning programme, while eleven community outreach sessions were attended\u000d\u000a      by 242 participants, both adults and children. These programmes [C1,\u000d\u000a        C2] supported part of the secondary school curriculum for Geography\u000d\u000a      (QCA Unit 2) `What sort of homes do people live in today?' and (QCA Unit\u000d\u000a      22) `A contrasting locality overseas'. The Education Officer for Access\u000d\u000a      and Public Programmes at the Geffrye Museum commented that it was \"a great\u000d\u000a      exhibition which was a joy to [design a] programme around, as it worked on\u000d\u000a      many levels for various different audiences. Not only was the content\u000d\u000a      [based on the research] fascinating, but the interactive re- creation of\u000d\u000a      the flat meant that people of all ages could engage with it.\"[C2,C3,C4]\u000d\u000a      Finally 1,478 children and 1,150 adults participated in 125 holiday\u000d\u000a      creative activities. In total, 2,628 people participated in educational\u000d\u000a      activities connected with this exhibition over its 6-month duration, which\u000d\u000a      compares favourably with the 803, 2,402, and 1,045 people who attended the\u000d\u000a      three previous temporary exhibition events (also of 6 months' duration) in\u000d\u000a      the same museum (see below for discussion of visitors' behaviour and\u000d\u000a      comments collected in a ethnographic study during the exhibition).[C5]\u000d\u000a    Museum audiences\u000d\u000a    As mentioned above, between June and August 2011, Daniels and two of her\u000d\u000a      MSc students, Laura Haapio-Kirk and Rosanna Blakeley, conducted an\u000d\u000a      ethnographic study of sixty visitors, who were selected at random to\u000d\u000a      evaluate and collect evidence of the impact of the exhibition. Their\u000d\u000a      interactions with the displays and each other were observed and recorded,\u000d\u000a      and they were then interviewed.[C5]\u000d\u000a    The study found that some participants were in search of knowledge (40%),\u000d\u000a      but more were driven by the pleasure of the unexpected (50%), while a\u000d\u000a      minority sought inspiration for their own homes (10%). Most importantly,\u000d\u000a      the study showed that the exhibition was successful in questioning\u000d\u000a      preconceptions about Japan. A British woman in her 70s admitted that\u000d\u000a      because of the war she held anti-Japanese sentiments but \"The display of\u000d\u000a      everyday normal living made me feel that Japanese people are very similar\u000d\u000a      to us\", while two British women in their 20s expected Japanese homes to be\u000d\u000a      \"compartmentalized and ordered\" but they actually found that they \"looked\u000d\u000a      messy and normal\". Of the 1,305 entries left in the visitors' book, only\u000d\u000a      23 were negative, representing overall an overwhelmingly positive\u000d\u000a      response.[C6]\u000d\u000a    Other comments, elicited in the ethnographic study,[C5]\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that the exhibition challenged preconceived stereotypes about\u000d\u000a      Japan. Typical examples were: \"Fascinating. Totally different from the\u000d\u000a      stereotypical image. A real eye opener\" and \"Excellent exhibition of\u000d\u000a      contemporary Japanese people's houses and lives. Very precise and detailed\u000d\u000a      description of Japanese life. This contributes a lot to understanding\u000d\u000a      Japan.\" Finally, all Japanese participants (10% of total visitors) were\u000d\u000a      upbeat. In the words of a Japanese man in his 30s living in London: \"The\u000d\u000a      exhibition shows Japanese lifestyle and not the stereotype. It is really\u000d\u000a      what the Japanese are like and not just what Westerners think they are\u000d\u000a      like.\"[C5]\u000d\u000a    When the exhibition closed, most objects were given away in a free raffle\u000d\u000a      attended by more than two hundred people and Daniels is currently\u000d\u000a      conducting a follow-up ethnographic study that investigates the direct\u000d\u000a      impact of some of these objects inside people's homes in the UK.\u000d\u000a      Ethnographic museums in Leiden, Stockholm, and Vancouver have expressed an\u000d\u000a      interest in hosting the show. In an updated version, Daniels will make\u000d\u000a      improvements suggested by visitors, such as enabling a more in-depth\u000d\u000a      engagement with the underpinning research through giving visitors the\u000d\u000a      opportunity to access additional information about specific objects\u000d\u000a      displayed through the use of mobile phones. Most participants were\u000d\u000a      positive about the interactive\/immersive aspect of the exhibition. As an\u000d\u000a      American in her 30s explained: \"One thing I really liked was that it was\u000d\u000a      extremely personal: I actually felt like I was in a Japanese film quite\u000d\u000a      often.\"[C7] The level of tactile interaction was influenced by\u000d\u000a      people's naturalisation into the `do not touch' philosophy adopted by most\u000d\u000a      museums, while the absence of clear instructions meant that many copied\u000d\u000a      others and those who had visited Japan or were Japanese frequently acted\u000d\u000a      as guides. In this manner the exhibition encouraged the transfer of\u000d\u000a      cultural knowledge and understanding between the researchers and those\u000d\u000a      attending the museum, and also between individual members of the\u000d\u000a      exhibition's audience.\u000d\u000a    Museum practitioners\u000d\u000a    To ensure that Daniels' research was fed back to museum practitioners, in\u000d\u000a      addition to publishing in the Bulletin of the National Museum of\u000d\u000a        Ethnology,[R7] she also presented these findings at\u000d\u000a      international conferences attended by curators at the British Museum\u000d\u000a      (2012), the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka (2013), and National\u000d\u000a      Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm (2013). The effect of this on those\u000d\u000a      attending is clear from a statement by the anthropologist responsible for\u000d\u000a      the European exhibition collections at the National Museum of Ethnology in\u000d\u000a      Osaka: \"`At Home in Japan' offers museum practitioners a new model for\u000d\u000a      facilitating more subjective, immersive visitor engagements with\u000d\u000a      exhibition displays.\"[C9] As confirmed by the Head of Collections\u000d\u000a      and Exhibitions at the Geffrye Museum, \"Amongst the many exhibitions I\u000d\u000a      have been involved in, this has been one of the most effective in taking\u000d\u000a      scholarly research and making it truly accessible and engaging to a wide\u000d\u000a      range of visitors, while also leaving a legacy for the future in terms of\u000d\u000a      enhancing our practice.\"[C8]\u000d\u000a    Media\u000d\u000a    As well as academic reviews, the exhibition had public reach through more\u000d\u000a      than one hundred articles in popular print media including The\u000d\u000a        Guardian, The Japan Times, the Telegraph (`top five\u000d\u000a      exhibitions in London'), the Evening Standard, and Time Out.\u000d\u000a      The exhibition was reviewed in a range of design and interiors magazines\u000d\u000a      such as ID Magazine, Styles, Interiors, and Blue\u000a        Print, which stated that \"At Home in Japan certainly succeeds in its\u000d\u000a      mission to demystify the Japanese home and shatter our minimalist\u000d\u000a      preconceptions.\"[C10] Public exposure was also increased via the\u000d\u000a      exhibition featuring on various blogs. Several quotes include: \"The\u000d\u000a      careful presentation made this a truly fascinating way to learn about\u000d\u000a      Japanese domestic culture\" (Culture Wars Blog, 08.07.11); \"I think\u000d\u000a      the exhibition fulfilled its aim completely. I felt so at home in the\u000d\u000a      exhibition, and so like I was really in Japan\" (Haikugirl's Japan Blog,\u000d\u000a      17.07.2011); and \"A number of strong similarities emerge in the ways\u000d\u000a      people behave at home which help the sense of empathy the exhibition tries\u000d\u000a      to create. The myth of minimalism [in Japan] is finally debunked\" (British\u000d\u000a      Council Blog.[C11]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The multi-sensory, immersive exhibition `At Home in Japan', held at the\u000d\u000a      Geffrye Museum in London in 2011, enabled Western audiences (including the\u000d\u000a      public and school groups) to gain a better understanding of everyday life\u000d\u000a      inside contemporary urban Japanese homes, overturning deep- rooted\u000d\u000a      cultural stereotypes that continue to depict Japan as the quintessential,\u000d\u000a      exotic Other. Through this exhibition, Daniels' ethnographic research has\u000d\u000a      had a wide cultural and educational impact on multiple audiences,\u000d\u000a      enhancing their understanding and appreciation of Japanese culture, and\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the fallacy of the traditional minimalist stereotype with\u000d\u000a      which it is commonly associated. The reach and significance of this impact\u000d\u000a      is substantiated by the large numbers of visitors to the exhibition, the\u000d\u000a      majority of whom responded extremely positively to the experience; the\u000d\u000a      success of the schools' programme, community outreach workshops,\u000d\u000a      curatorial tours, and study days; and the extensive enthusiastic coverage\u000d\u000a      in traditional media and on the internet. Moreover, through its innovative\u000d\u000a      uses of photographs and objects, the exhibition has been able to take\u000d\u000a      museum practice in a new direction, encouraging in other museums similar\u000d\u000a      approaches to enriching visitor experiences.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Oxford\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1853909","Name":"Osaka-shi"},{"GeoNamesId":"6173331","Name":"Vancouver"},{"GeoNamesId":"2673730","Name":"Stockholm"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    (*submitted as part of REF2)\u000d\u000a    \u000a[R1]* Daniels, I. 2010.

Two aspects of\u000d\u000a      Daniels' research have had particular impact on the public understanding\u000d\u000a      of Japanese culture.\u000d\u000a    1) The Japanese House: Material Culture in the Modern Home\u000d\u000a    In preparation for the publication of her academic monograph entitled The\u000a        Japanese House, [Section 3: R1] Daniels undertook a year of\u000d\u000a      field research in thirty urban homes in the Kansai area (Osaka, Kyoto,\u000d\u000a      Kobe) during 2003, followed by a visual project carried out in the same\u000d\u000a      region in 2006. This research generated a large quantity of ethnographic\u000d\u000a      material, including visual and sound data, from which Daniels drew the\u000d\u000a      conclusions published in the monograph and elsewhere.[R1-R6]\u000d\u000a    Daniels' findings challenge widespread stereotypes about Japanese\u000d\u000a      aesthetics by revealing the messiness and contradictions of everyday\u000d\u000a      domestic life.[R1,R5,R6] This is the first academic study, based on\u000d\u000a      living for a prolonged period of time with Japanese families inside their\u000d\u000a      homes, to elucidate the implicit but interconnected logics of the use of\u000d\u000a      space and the use of material culture within the home. The Japanese\u000d\u000a        House shows how domestic practices change through the seasons and\u000d\u000a      how they have changed over time,[R1,R5] highlighting the importance\u000d\u000a      of backstage activities such as storage, cleaning, and bathing in the\u000d\u000a      reproduction of social life. The book highlights the impact of post-war\u000d\u000a      changes to the exterior, the layout, and the use of dwelling spaces, while\u000d\u000a      paying particular attention to domestic tensions as inhabitants strive to\u000d\u000a      balance the relationship between the individual and the collective, to\u000d\u000a      negotiate multiple connections between the home, the community, and the\u000d\u000a      state,[R1,R6] and to create beneficial alignments with spirits,\u000d\u000a      ancestors, and the material world.[R1,R2] More generally, Daniels'\u000d\u000a      research offers a model for studying the house worldwide that accounts for\u000d\u000a      both local specificity and common, cross-cultural human experiences.[R3,R4]\u000d\u000a    2) At Home in Japan &#8212; Beyond the Minimal House\u000d\u000a    This research and Daniels' previous ethnographic research in Japan (since\u000d\u000a      1996) led directly to Daniels' exhibition `At Home in Japan &#8212; Beyond the\u000d\u000a      Minimal House', held at the Geffrye Museum, London, from March 22 until\u000d\u000a      August 29, 2011. In particular, the specific ethnographic material, and\u000d\u000a      the visual and sound data used to produce the exhibition displays, stem\u000d\u000a      from her fieldwork in Kansai in 2003 and 2006. The exhibition draws on\u000d\u000a      these findings to explore how anthropologists and museum practitioners may\u000d\u000a      benefit from using innovative visual methods and representations, as well\u000d\u000a      as three-dimensional environments, to disseminate research results more\u000d\u000a      effectively to a wider audience.[R7]\u000d\u000a    Based on Daniels' ethnographic data the exhibit recreated a standard\u000d\u000a      Japanese flat [R6] that was filled with everyday objects donated\u000d\u000a      by participants in her research, while taped sounds and life- size\u000d\u000a      photographs taken inside the homes studied,[R1] as well as written\u000d\u000a      commentary by both Daniels and the Japanese participants, were employed to\u000d\u000a      evoke what it feels like to be at home in contemporary Japan. This\u000d\u000a      multi-modal approach does not treat culture and experience as text, but\u000d\u000a      creates an immersive space filled with everyday goods (instead of unique\u000d\u000a      iconic objects) that visitors can explore with all their senses.[R7]\u000d\u000a      Thus, people could put on slippers, look inside closets, open drawers, try\u000d\u000a      on clothing, sit on chairs and sofas, and generally pick up and handle any\u000d\u000a      of the objects used in the exhibition. Importantly, the exhibition did not\u000d\u000a      assume one mode of `passive' learning, but, by stressing complexity and\u000d\u000a      ambiguity, it challenged any totalizing view and aimed to foster a more\u000d\u000a      personal, intuitive understanding, thereby empowering both the audience\u000d\u000a      and those depicted.[R7]\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17634","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Mascie-Taylor's research has been widely recognised as having had a\u000d\u000a      significant influence on UK and Bangladesh government policy, practice and\u000d\u000a      understanding in relation to food supplementation and the association\u000d\u000a      between poverty and undernutrition. By being instrumental in bringing\u000d\u000a      about changes in government policy and practice, the study has benefited\u000d\u000a      the poor of Bangladesh and improved their health, wellbeing and nutrition\u000d\u000a      and reduced individual and household poverty through new programmes\u000d\u000a      involving 250,000 households (~1 million participants).\u000d\u000a    Professor Mascie-Taylor and his research team were invited to initially\u000d\u000a      disseminate the research findings in 2003 through a half-day symposium\u000d\u000a      held at the National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM),\u000d\u000a      Dhaka with key stakeholders as well as at meetings with World Bank and\u000d\u000a      DFID personnel. Naturally, the findings from NMT's research around the\u000d\u000a      lack of impact of the BINP on infant weight gain caused significant\u000d\u000a      concern. Following this and with input from Professor Taylor and citing\u000d\u000a      the above research (p.155), the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) an\u000d\u000a      independent unit within the World Bank; carried out a re-analysis of the\u000d\u000a      BINP outcome data and published the report `Maintaining Momentum to\u000d\u000a        2015? An Impact Evaluation of Interventions to Improve Maternal and\u000d\u000a        Child Health and Nutrition in Bangladesh` (February 2005, OED, World\u000d\u000a      Bank)(a), drawing similar conclusions (e.g. p.38 `However,\u000d\u000a        nutritional outcomes in terms of low birth weight have been\u000d\u000a        disappointing'. p211 `Participation in supplementary feeding was\u000d\u000a        not found to have a significant impact')(b)\u000d\u000a    This report then led to a second World Bank report in 2005 `The\u000d\u000a        Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project, Effectiveness and Lessons'\u000d\u000a      aiming to address this controversial issue. The report states `p.iii\u000d\u000a    `There has been considerable debate in the press and the scientific\u000d\u000a        community and among development partners about the impact of BINP. This\u000d\u000a        study tries to lay that debate to rest by critically reviewing the\u000d\u000a        various evaluations and trying to explain the variation across the\u000d\u000a        results that were obtained.'\u000d\u000a    The report repeatedly cites the findings of the above research as well as\u000d\u000a      the OED re-analysis, and reluctantly acknowledged the validity of NMT's\u000d\u000a      findings on supplementary feeding and weight gain. For example it states\u000d\u000a    `the available evidence from BINP does not show that it improved\u000d\u000a        growth in BINP children, weight gain in pregnant women, or birth weight\u000d\u000a        in infants.' (p.37).\u000d\u000a    Eventually, a clear impact of the research on policy and practice was the\u000d\u000a      ending of the National Nutrition Programme in 2011 as a result of the\u000d\u000a      recognition by the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and The World Bank that\u000d\u000a      Mascie-Taylor's independent research had shown a number of significant\u000d\u000a      weaknesses in the programme's design and implementation. In the light of\u000d\u000a      these weaknesses, the GoB, in the new Health, Population and Nutrition\u000d\u000a      Sector Development Programme (HPNSDP, 2011-2016), closed the NNP(c)\u000d\u000a      and decided to implement a new policy incorporating the outcomes of\u000d\u000a      Mascie-Taylor's earlier research.\u000d\u000a    Subsequently, DFID has collaborated with the Government of Bangladesh in\u000d\u000a      two projects designed to meet MDG1, again building on Mascie-Taylor and\u000d\u000a      team's evaluations of the BINP\/NNP and CFW programme. These programmes,\u000d\u000a      Shiree\/Economic Empowerment of the Poorest Programme (EEP), aim to bring\u000d\u000a      1.5 million people out of poverty by 2015 and involve a number of NGOs. As\u000d\u000a      a result of the importance attached to his research outcomes,\u000d\u000a      Mascie-Taylor was invited to become the Nutrition Advisor on these\u000d\u000a      projects and also to lead the evaluation of the effectiveness of the\u000d\u000a      programmes. His engagement on the project has extended to capacity\u000d\u000a      building for local staff to undertake monitoring and evaluation. Evidence\u000d\u000a      from the programme evaluation (being undertaken by Mascie-Taylor and Goto\u000d\u000a      for DFID) has already shown significant benefits to programme participants\u000d\u000a      (DFID, 2011, 2012 and 2013)(d,e). Improvements were also found\u000d\u000a      in wealth and income, expenditure, nutrition and health.\u000d\u000a    In the first year of the programme (2010-2011) average household\u000d\u000a        assets rose by 7000 Taka\/month and again by 3000 Taka\/month between\u000d\u000a      2011 and 2012. Mascie-Taylor's research into this improvement has\u000d\u000a      attributed this to increased animal ownership (an increase of 28.4% to\u000d\u000a      63.9% of households) and land ownership (15.2% to 31.4%).\u000d\u000a    Income also rose &#8212; from 1766 Taka\/month to 3298 Taka\/month in\u000d\u000a      2012. Whilst expenditure also rose over the period (from 19.5 Taka pppd to\u000d\u000a      26.3 Taka pppd), by 2012, nearly all households on the programme devised\u000d\u000a      mainly by Mascie-Taylor had managed to accumulate some cash savings (84%)\u000d\u000a      compared with less than 36% at the outset of the programme in 2010.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the amount of savings had increased by over 10 fold (from\u000d\u000a      about &#163;3 to over &#163;30).\u000d\u000a    The increased household income and in rural areas the promotion of\u000d\u000a      household gardens resulted in nearly all household reporting improved\u000d\u000a        nutrition. Most householder members reported eating three meals\/day\u000d\u000a      and with greater food diversity, especially increased consumption of fish,\u000d\u000a      eggs and green leafy vegetables.\u000d\u000a    There are positive signs of the programme having fostered improvements\u000a        in nutritional status with adults gaining weight and the prevalence\u000d\u000a      of anaemia falling. In children the prevalence of anaemia, which had been\u000d\u000a      very high at over 60%, fell to only 36%, which is less than the national\u000d\u000a      prevalence.\u000d\u000a    The programmes have also been associated with improvements in health.\u000d\u000a      For example, subsequent analysis of the results has shown that the\u000d\u000a      proportion of programme participants reporting chronic health conditions\u000d\u000a      dropped from 15.6% to during the same period. There were also reported\u000d\u000a      reductions in fever and coughs in children and babies.\u000d\u000a\u0009A summary of impact is provided below (reproduced from report).

Nick Mascie-Taylor,\u000d\u000a      who joined the University of Cambridge in 1974, has been Professor of\u000d\u000a      Human Population Biology and Health since 1999 in the Department of\u000d\u000a      Archaeology and Anthropology, together with members of his research group,\u000d\u000a      have undertaken a wide-reaching programme of research on the effect of\u000d\u000a      poverty and undernutrition in Bangladesh which has underpinned the impact\u000d\u000a      described in this case study.\u000d\u000a    Research: Professor Mascie-Taylor was the overall principal\u000d\u000a      investigator leading the underpinning collaborative research in the period\u000d\u000a      2000-2012, involving members of his research group and\u000d\u000a      researchers\/advisors from NIPSOM &#8212; National institute of preventive and\u000d\u000a      social medicine, Dhaka, Bangladesh; DFID and the University of Dhaka,\u000d\u000a      Bangladesh (details below).\u000d\u000a    Undernutrition is primarily caused by inadequate dietary intake (both\u000d\u000a      quantity and quality) and disease, but the underlying driver is poverty.\u000d\u000a      Mascie-Taylor's initial research evaluated a Government of\u000d\u000a      Bangladesh-funded food supplementation programme (Bangladesh Integrated\u000d\u000a      Nutrition Program, BNIP, later the National Nutrition Program, NNP)\u000d\u000a      involving pregnant mothers and under two years of age children. Under the\u000d\u000a      programme undernourished pregnant women and undernourished children under\u000d\u000a      2 were given food.\u000d\u000a    Although the aims of the BNIP programme were considered highly laudable,\u000d\u000a      DFID was concerned that the BNIP was not actually succeeding in improving\u000d\u000a      infant weight gain. Thus, with funding from DFID (distributed through The\u000d\u000a      British Council) Mascie-Taylor was asked to lead a research project to\u000d\u000a      evaluate the programme processes and its outcomes. The research took place\u000d\u000a      between 1999 and 2003 involved local colleagues from the Department of\u000d\u000a      Health Economics, University of Dhaka (Begum) and the National Institute\u000d\u000a      of Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM) (Nahar, S) &#8212; the national level\u000d\u000a      public health institute under the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh; which\u000d\u000a      in addition to research supports health policy formulation of the\u000d\u000a      government of Bangladesh and community health programs through research,\u000d\u000a      training and services. . This research showed that the BNIP was not\u000d\u000a      effective in a number of respects. For example, undernourished pregnant\u000d\u000a      mothers were poorly diagnosed, compliance was low and there was no\u000d\u000a      significant impact of food supplementation on improving birth weight\u000d\u000a      (Nahar et al., 2009); infants receiving supplementation did not grow\u000d\u000a      better and there was no evidence of improvement in nutritional status\u000d\u000a      (Begum et al., 2007) (1)(3). The research demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      some of these disappointing outcomes were a consequence of the design and\u000d\u000a      implementation of the programme: in particular, targeting of the programme\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries was not appropriate while the food supplement provided to\u000d\u000a      children and pregnant women was of low nutritional quality. Accountability\u000d\u000a      in the programme was sub-optimal and the monitoring and evaluation\u000d\u000a      mechanisms were weak. Furthermore, the programme had not covered any of\u000d\u000a      the cities with substantial slum populations.\u000d\u000a    In a later study (2) Mascie-Taylor led the investigation of\u000d\u000a      the impact of poverty alleviation programmes on nutritional intake and\u000d\u000a      outcomes. In Bangladesh after the planting of the Aman rice crop there is\u000d\u000a      a hunger season (September to November) primarily due to a lack of job\u000d\u000a      opportunities for rural workers. Between September and December 2007,\u000d\u000a      working with DFID colleagues on their Chars Livelihood Programme (Marks,\u000d\u000a      MK and Islam R), Mascie-Taylor's team (involving Dr Rie Goto, Research\u000d\u000a      associate, University of Cambridge, since 2008) conducted a study\u000d\u000a      investigating a policy concern that a cash-for-work programme for mothers\u000d\u000a      might cause undernutrition as women undertook more physical work away from\u000d\u000a      their families. The study looked at households who took part in the\u000d\u000a      cash-for-work programme and similar households not taking part in the\u000d\u000a      programme, and concluded that the cash-for-work programme had led to\u000d\u000a      greater household food expenditure and consumption and women's and\u000d\u000a      children's nutritional status had improved, adding that \"over the longer\u000d\u000a      term, the significant reduction of both acute and chronic malnutrition\u000d\u000a      among chars dwellers will depend on lifting them out of poverty\"\u000d\u000a      (Mascie-Taylor et al., 2010).(2)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17635","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Bayly's research on the development of cultural knowledge and\u000a      educational expertise during and after the revolution strongly influenced\u000a      Vietnam's Centre for Research and Promotion of the Cultural Heritage\u000a        (CCH) and Centre for Research and Preservation of Vietnam's\u000a        Doctoral Heritage (CPD) in designing their policies for cultural\u000a      heritage preservation, appreciation and education.\u000a    CCH (founded 2007) pioneers heritage preservation and public\u000a      cultural awareness in Vietnam.

In 2012 she participated in an initiative to foster\u000a      public understanding of Vietnam's history of Mother Goddess (Dao Mau)\u000a      worship as a major repository of artistic and cultural value &#8212; an aspect\u000a      of Vietnam's cultural life previously undervalued by citizens and\u000a      authorities. Dr Bayly's research, both on Vietnam and Indian religions,\u000a      was critical to this initiative, which resulted in the recognition that\u000a      this worship is an expression of spiritual and artistic value which\u000a      compares favourably with spiritual traditions in other dynamic Asian\u000a      cultures.(a) In September 2012, this initiative culminated in\u000a      an international public outreach congress on the Mother Goddess tradition\u000a      (to which Dr Bayly contributed), attended by hundreds of delegates\u000a      including community performers and ministry officials.

(c)(d)(e)\u000a    Another key CCH initiative is motivating the public to address the\u000a      challenges of climate change in Vietnam. Here Dr Bayly's research has\u000a      demonstrated the scientific contributions of the country's 20th-century\u000a      intellectuals (and the high regard they had for a close harmony of\u000a      human-made and environmental forms and features), supporting calls to\u000a      action and inspiring the young to contribute. In 2010-12, Dr Bayly\u000a      actively supported CCH's work in making environmental awareness and\u000a      climate issues central to hands-on museum-based activities for school-age\u000a      visitors at Vietnam's most important museum, the Ho Chi Minh Museum.\u000a    CPD (established 2008) is a public foundation fostering public\u000a      awareness of Vietnamese scientists' and scholars' work and careers as a\u000a      crucial part of Vietnam's living cultural heritage. It aims to ensure that\u000a      the contributions made by modern scientists and scholars to Vietnam and\u000a      the world are considered as much a part of Vietnam's cultural heritage as\u000a      the old arts and traditions.\u000a    Dr Bayly's research on how intellectuals lived and worked in the times of\u000a      the national revolution helped CPD exemplify the importance of this aspect\u000a      of Vietnam's life &#8212; helping in getting the Centre launched, and initiating\u000a      programmes of collecting, preserving and displaying the papers, diaries,\u000a      artworks, folk crafts, research equipment, books and official documents.\u000a      These collections include relics of Vietnamese scientists' work and life\u000a      experiences such as the remarkable instruments and treatment items\u000a      developed for battlefield use in Vietnam's liberation wars, not previously\u000a      considered valuable items of cultural heritage.\u000a    \"Her book Asian Voices in a Postcolonial Age has influenced us\u000a        very much because it is a study by an international scholar of exactly\u000a        the sort of Vietnamese modern cultural life that our Centre works to\u000a        preserve and make publicly known throughout our country.\" (Director,\u000a      CPD).

This\u000a      generation &#8212; now in their 60s and 70s &#8212; lived through foreign occupation,\u000a      partition, wars with the USA, China and Cambodia, reunification and\u000a      marketization. Dr Bayly's research gathered and presented their personal\u000a      stories of experiences before and since independence and liberation,\u000a      seemingly vastly removed from the experiences of modern Vietnam; stories\u000a      of their wartime childhoods and experiences as development workers and\u000a      educators in Africa in the 1970s to early 90s that would otherwise have\u000a      been lost in the current phase of rapid social change.\u000a    The research provided valuable insights into Vietnam's history and\u000a      development and place in the world. Emphasis was placed on education and\u000a      culture amongst Hanoi intelligentsia in spite of the complex political\u000a      context: it was not uncommon for people to amass qualifications from\u000a      numerous sources, to follow multiple professions and to learn multiple\u000a      languages including Russian, Chinese and in some cases even French. This\u000a      generation of intelligentsia valued training &#8212; in science and medicine in\u000a      particular &#8212; and working in countries with similar backgrounds: Poland,\u000a      Romania and the USSR for example. Development specialists aided\u000a      development in former French colonies. Their work is widely credited with\u000a      valuable economic and cultural benefits to the host countries, and to\u000a      Vietnam, including the groundwork they provided for today's flourishing\u000a      links and interactions with a host of African trading and cultural\u000a      exchange partners.\u000a    This development of knowledge and expertise was motivated by a belief\u000a      that it benefited one's country and family. Through her interviews Dr\u000a      Bayly also heard stories of how the Hanoi intelligentsia took personal\u000a      risks to preserve cultural resources during different phases of occupation\u000a      and war. Others told stories of producing, preserving and appreciating\u000a      art; again with a wider social\/national goal in mind.\u000a    This older generation reported attempts to pass on stories of cultural\u000a      achievement to young people who, nowadays, sometimes struggle to\u000a      understand how things were in the recent past.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19879","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2395170","Name":"Benin"},{"GeoNamesId":"2453866","Name":"Mali"},{"GeoNamesId":"2403846","Name":"Sierra Leone"},{"GeoNamesId":"2361809","Name":"Burkina Faso"},{"GeoNamesId":"2245662","Name":"Senegal"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Influence on the global policy shift in charging for essential health\u000d\u000a        care\u000d\u000a      Multilateral and bilateral agencies have had a significant influence on\u000d\u000a      this area of policy in most low income countries. Major influencing\u000d\u000a      bodies, such as the World Bank, UNICEF and WHO, now all emphasise the need\u000d\u000a      to make essential services free at the point of use, reflected in the\u000d\u000a      Universal Health Coverage movement and marked by the 2010 World Health\u000d\u000a      Report. This change has influenced national policies in a range of\u000d\u000a      countries. At the country level, a recent mapping study found that more\u000d\u000a      than half of the high-mortality countries surveyed (28 out of 50) had, in\u000d\u000a      the last few years, introduced reforms to their user fee regimes (http:\/\/bit.ly\/17FUiDM).\u000a      Our citation (see below) in major policy reports of these agencies implies\u000d\u000a      use of the research in the relevant policy processes and continuous\u000d\u000a      citation over a 20 year period demonstrates sustained inputs.\u000d\u000a    Our work can also be shown to have been used in the development of\u000d\u000a      specific bilateral agencies' policy responses, including those of both\u000d\u000a      DFID and DANIDA which have both significantly supported development of\u000d\u000a      alternatives to user fees. For example, McPake's work was the\u000d\u000a      primary basis on which Save the Children lobbied DFID to the effect that \"Save\u000a        the Children UK believes that ensuring equitable financing of healthcare\u000d\u000a        is the single biggest contribution that DFID could make (to\u000d\u000a      improving reproductive, maternal and newborn health outcomes)\".\u000d\u000a    McPake and Witter's work has supported Save the Children\u000d\u000a      in its advocacy and policy advisory work more generally. The `Freeing-Up\u000d\u000a      Health Care' tool (http:\/\/bit.ly\/H8HbWL)\u000d\u000a      developed by McPake and others, was commissioned for this purpose\u000d\u000a      and Witter was also commissioned to review the whole debate in\u000d\u000a      2005. We have also undertaken specific pieces of research for Save the\u000d\u000a      Children, reviewing health insurance proposals in Sierra Leone and\u000d\u000a      documenting financial barriers to access in Tanzania.\u000d\u000a    Policy change and effective implementation in country\u000d\u000a      We have contributed directly to policy and policy implementation detail in\u000d\u000a      specific countries. Witter has been invited to be a technical\u000d\u000a      expert supporting countries in moving towards universal coverage. She has\u000d\u000a      provided advice to Sudan, Nepal, Ghana, Liberia and Vietnam.\u000d\u000a    In Ghana, Witter's evaluation of the maternal fee exemption\u000d\u000a      policy raised serious concerns about the funding, implementation and\u000d\u000a      sustainability of the policy. These contributed to revision of the policy,\u000d\u000a      with financial protection of pregnant women ultimately being transferred\u000d\u000a      to the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2008. In the\u000d\u000a      first year of implementation alone, 433,000 additional women had access to\u000d\u000a      health care. Advisory work by Witter, including heavy involvement\u000d\u000a      in annual health sector reviews in 2006, 2007 and 2009, has also\u000d\u000a      contributed to the development of the NHIS.\u000d\u000a    Since then the tools developed in Ghana have been used in adapted form in\u000d\u000a      other countries introducing similar policies &#8212; for example, in Senegal and\u000d\u000a      Mali. In Nepal, the tools were adapted to evaluate and propose refinements\u000d\u000a      to the Safe Delivery Incentive Scheme, which has raised utilisation of\u000d\u000a      skilled delivery (http:\/\/1.usa.gov\/GWCyi2)\u000d\u000a      and contributed to the decline in maternal mortality (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1an6Q4D).\u000d\u000a      In Sudan, these tools were used to review the policy of free caesareans\u000d\u000a      and care of under-5s. This was then reformed and re-launched by the\u000d\u000a      Federal Ministry of Health, with advice from Witter. The lessons\u000d\u000a      learned on policy design and implementation are now guiding her advice to\u000d\u000a      Sierra Leone, Mali, Benin, Burkina Faso and Morocco.\u000d\u000a    Impacts for ultimate beneficiaries\u000d\u000a      The ultimate beneficiaries of these policy changes are those whose access\u000d\u000a      to care is made easier by the removal of financial barriers or who avoid\u000d\u000a      financially-catastrophic payments. Pregnant women and young children have\u000d\u000a      often been targeted for free care and have benefited disproportionately.\u000d\u000a      According to the research conducted by McPake and Witter\u000d\u000a      among others, these groups will benefit in terms of reduced mortality and\u000d\u000a      morbidity, reduced impoverishment related to out-of-pocket payments and\u000d\u000a      mitigation of the diverse negative effects of coping strategies (debts,\u000d\u000a      sale of assets, increased work for household members). Further work is\u000d\u000a      needed to quantify these impacts.\u000d\u000a    In addition, there are knock-on benefits for national economies.\u000d\u000a      Globally, $15 billion was estimated in 2001 to be lost every year due to\u000d\u000a      reduced productivity related to the death of mothers and neonates\u000d\u000a      (according to USAID: http:\/\/1.usa.gov\/1c6YgxN).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Public financing of health services in low income countries was\u000d\u000a      challenged by the World Bank's Agenda for Reform in 1987, which advocated\u000d\u000a      increased roles for private sector, private insurance and user fees. This\u000d\u000a      was followed by a wave of reforms implementing this approach.

This\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the complexity of the realities of health financing impacts.\u000d\u000a      This work was followed by an EU-funded research project (1994-1997) in\u000d\u000a      Uganda, which explored these complexities further and was the first\u000d\u000a      research focusing on the supply side response to financing policy change,\u000d\u000a      issues at the core of the current discussion (McPake et al., 1999).\u000d\u000a    Witter's work before joining QMU, as a principal health economist\u000d\u000a      on the IMMPACT programme held by Aberdeen University, has focused on the\u000d\u000a      development of multidisciplinary tools to assess health-financing impacts,\u000d\u000a      understanding the preconditions for policies addressing the effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of financial barriers and developing a better understanding of the\u000d\u000a      relationship of financial and other barriers to health care access, such\u000d\u000a      as transport and cultural factors. Among the important findings from this\u000d\u000a      work are that involving and incentivising staff is a critical component in\u000d\u000a      the implementation of health-financing policy and this insight prompted\u000d\u000a      further work, including a systematic review for the Cochrane collaboration\u000d\u000a      (Witter et al., 2012).\u000d\u000a    McPake's more recent research undertaken at QMU has included\u000d\u000a      desk-based research relating analysis of cost and health worker time\u000d\u000a      allocation to the financial implications of user fee policy change. This\u000d\u000a      was part-funded by Save the Children Fund. A tool to help countries that\u000d\u000a      want to remove user charges to do so was developed (McPake et al.,\u000d\u000a      2011, http:\/\/bit.ly\/H8HbWL).

The\u000a      framework, and associated indicators, were first presented to an\u000a      interdepartmental UK government meeting in July 2004 involving staff from\u000a      several branches of the Home Office, the Department of Health, Department\u000a      of Social Security and Department of Education. The `Indicators of\u000a      Integration' framework was then published as a series of `Development and\u000a      Practice' reports by the UK Home Office (Ager and Strang,\u000a      2004a; 2004b).\u000a    Prior to the publication of this work, policy, in the UK and across\u000a      Europe, was structured around domains of service provision (`Markers and\u000a      Means'), reflecting a very `top-down' approach based on governmental\u000a      priorities and perspectives with little or no explicit reference to social\u000a      relationships. The European Council for Refugees and Exiles, an advocacy\u000a      group, had argued that refugee integration should be seen as a `two-way\u000a      process' (ECRE, 2005). The IOI provided empirical evidence to support this\u000a      claim and threw light on the ways in which communities themselves (both\u000a      refugees and non-refugees) experience belonging together.\u000a    Policy on refugee integration across the world now regularly demonstrates\u000a      a much broader set of parameters, reflecting the domains of the IOI\u000a      framework. Our research has been cited widely in policy processes around\u000a      the world that have led up to this change, including in Scotland, England,\u000a      Australia, New Zealand and across the European Union as itemised in the\u000a      documents listed below to corroborate impact. Following the dissemination\u000a      of the IntegraRef report, Strang has been invited to a\u000a      number of EU consultation events to contribute to the shaping of EU\u000a      integration policy. Social connections in particular are given prominence\u000a      where once they were ignored, as exemplified by the most recent report by\u000a      UNHCR on behalf of the European Union (see below).\u000a    Impact on practice is most readily seen in Scotland, where we have been\u000a      working closely with both the Scottish Refugee Council and Scottish\u000a      Government to support them in the application of the research. Following\u000a      the Scottish Refugee Integration Forum Action Plan, the Scottish\u000a      Government required that applicants for government funding should specify\u000a      how their project would contribute to the different domains of the IOI\u000a      framework. In that way the framework directly impacted on the allocation\u000a      of funds to ensure that support projects addressed the appropriate range\u000a      of refugees' integration needs. In 2012, Scottish Government, in\u000a      collaboration with the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC) and the Convention\u000a      of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA), convened a consultative\u000a      cross-sector review of integration strategy using the framework as a\u000a      design principle to ensure systematic coverage of the key issues. On the\u000a      invitation of Scottish Government, Strang is leading this process\u000a      as independent Chair. The final strategy report will be launched in\u000a      December 2013, however it is already clear that the series of consultation\u000a      events (organised according to the themes of the IOI framework from Oct\u000a      2012 to June 2013) has improved partnership working between the public and\u000a      voluntary sector and across sectors.\u000a    The Scottish Refugee Council has used the framework consistently since\u000a      2004 to inform and evaluate their integration support and community\u000a      development programme and for staff and community training. This has led\u000a      to an increased emphasis on promoting social connections between refugees\u000a      and established members of local communities as well as between refugees.\u000a      There are now two strong community groups run by refugees (the `Scottish\u000a      Refugee Policy Forum' and the `Refugee Women's Strategy Group') both of\u000a      which demonstrate a clear commitment to building social connections at the\u000a      level of `bonds', `bridges' and `links' as elaborated by the IOI\u000a      framework. The Scottish Refugee Council has also invested in dialogue with\u000a      other service provider partners to emphasise the interdependence of\u000a      different services in supporting integration. The Council has undertaken a\u000a      longitudinal study of integration from 2009 to 2012, based on the IOI\u000a      work, designed to inform their own practice and contribute to advocacy and\u000a      the evidence base on refugee integration in the UK (http:\/\/bit.ly\/17y8Kif).\u000a      (Strang is on the Advisory Group.)\u000a    During 2012\/13 a former student of IIHD (Esa Aldegheri) used our research\u000a      as the basis of her work with the Refugee Survival Trust to promote\u000a      two-way integration between refugees and established Scottish communities.\u000a      She initiated and led a poetry project, `Making it Home', which brought\u000a      together the refugee women of the Maryhill Integration Network (set up by\u000a      the Scottish Refugee Council) and the women of Pilton (an economically and\u000a      socially deprived established Scottish community in Edinburgh). The\u000a      project was show-cased by the Scottish Refugee Council in their launch of\u000a      Refugee Week in the Scottish Parliament in June 2013 (http:\/\/bit.ly\/GWlxnN).\u000a    Feedback from policy makers and practitioners has consistently emphasised\u000a      the importance of the domains of `social connection'. Partner projects are\u000a      continuing to use the practical tool developed by the research team that\u000a      has been piloted in Darfur and Glasgow to gather data independently. This\u000a      equips project staff and communities with the tools to map social\u000a      connections in their own contexts in a way that empowers decision making\u000a      and also provides robust data for funders and policy makers.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Integration of refugees, asylum seekers and their host communities is a\u000a      complex challenge but an important marker both of future health and\u000a      psychosocial wellbeing and of social cohesion.

A comprehensive investigation of types\u000a      of `integration', in the context of refugees settling in high-income\u000a      countries, was conducted to develop a conceptual framework representing\u000a      core aspects of refugee integration. Indicators for each domain of the\u000a      framework were proposed (Figure 1).\u000a    The research concluded that refugee integration is understood as a\u000a      combination of all these factors and that each `domain' impacts on every\u000a      other (for example, the nature of housing provision impacts on sense of\u000a      security, the development of social connections and access to employment\u000a      or educational opportunities). Thus, status in any one of the domains can\u000a      be seen as a `marker' (or indicator) of integration, but it is also in\u000a      itself a means of progressing integration across the domains. It was\u000a      proposed that refugee integration policy should address all of these\u000a      domains and recognise the interaction between them.\u000a    The `Indicators of Integration' framework contributed to addressing a\u000a      theoretical, policy and practice void by providing a systematic\u000a      elaboration of the elemental components of refugee integration. It\u000a      highlighted the core role of social connection and systematised the role\u000a      of language and cultural knowledge, along with sense of safety and\u000a      security. A particular innovation was to apply theoretical constructs\u000a      distinguishing different types of connection (`Bridges', `Bonds' and\u000a      `Links') from social capital literature (Putnam 1993, Woolcock 1998) to\u000a      this field.\u000a    The UK study was followed in 2007-2008 by `IntegraRef', an EU\u000a      funded collaborative study extending the IOI approach to the study of\u000a      refugee integration in Germany, Italy, and Malta for which Strang\u000a      and O'Brien (Lecturer, IIHD) acted as scientific advisors. This\u000a      study established the validity of the IOI framework in the wider EU\u000a      context.\u000a    From 2009 to 2012 the Scottish Refugee Council used the framework as the\u000a      basis for a longitudinal study on refugee integration for which Strang\u000a      was on the Advisory Board (Mulvey, 2013). In 2010, a special issue of the\u000a      Journal of Refugee Studies, `Critical Reflections on Refugee\u000a      Integration: Lessons from International Perspectives' (http:\/\/bit.ly\/17RfJSk),\u000a      was published, bringing together a range of international research using\u000a      the IOI framework to critique aspects of refugee integration.\u000a    The IIHD team has built on this research by elaborating understanding of\u000a      social connection in refugee contexts. An assessment tool is being\u000a      developed for use by local project staff and community groups to map the\u000a      pattern of social connections in terms of the IOI framework. A series of\u000a      collaborative studies have been undertaken to refine the approach and\u000a      identify patterns of social connection in contrasting refugee contexts,\u000a      including Darfur and Glasgow.

This, and other fieldwork,\u000a      particularly with hunters in\u000a      Europe, was incorporated in Marvin's more wide-ranging book on humans and\u000a      wolves, Wolf (see\u000a      below, this section). Research into human-animal interactions through the\u000a      prism of the wolf has\u000a      demonstrated that perceptions of the animal were specific to a range of\u000a      social, cultural and\u000a      historical factors that have changed over time. In particular, the focus\u000a      of Marvin's interest is the\u000a      concern that people express for a dangerous predator that intrudes into\u000a      human concerns\u000a      (particularly in terms of livestock predation) and is seen as a potential\u000a      predator on humans.\u000a    In order to promote this research to as broad an audience as possible,\u000a      Marvin has since 2009\u000a      given a range of public lectures at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust (UKWCT)\u000a      during their annual\u000a      Wolf Awareness Weeks, and has written a number of high-profile\u000a      public-orientated publications.\u000a      For example, he contributed an article entitled `Wolves: now at our door'\u000a      to The Guardian (27 July\u000a      2011) on this theme, which prompted debate (343 online comments) about the\u000a      reintroduction of\u000a      wolves, and animals of prey more broadly, into Britain. In January 2012,\u000a      Marvin published Wolf\u000a      (London: Reaktion Books), a text based on original research aimed at a\u000a      wide public audience,\u000a      exploring scientific understanding and cultural perceptions of this\u000a      animal. The reach of the book is\u000a      indicated by sales figures to 31 July 2013 of over 3000.This research has\u000a      contributed to wider\u000a      public discourse and understanding around wolves, as evidenced by critical\u000a      reception in\u000a      newspapers (The Guardian, Globe and Mail [Toronto]), specialist\u000a      magazines (BBC Wildlife\u000a        Magazine, Wolf Print) and the blogosphere. In particular, frequent\u000a      recognition of the socio-cultural\u000a      contexts in which the wolf is understood attests to the impact of the\u000a      research, for example: \"...it is\u000a        clear from this exquisitely researched and carefully structured book\u000a        that our perception of Canis\u000a      lupus is a complex one . . . it probes much deeper and into a\u000a        fascinating well of ideas, namely how\u000a        cultural beliefs shape our opinions and emotions when it comes to this\u000a        particular carnivore\" (from\u000a      Wolf Print, magazine of the UKWCT).\u000a    Marvin undertook research at the UKWCT for the section of the book\u000a      exploring themes of re-valuing\u000a      wolves. Following publication of Wolf he was invited by Tsa Palmer\u000a      (Director of the Trust)\u000a      to become an Advisor to the UKWCT. In this capacity, he has also donated\u000a      the library he acquired\u000a      through the research to the Education Department of the UKWCT. The UKWCT\u000a      is now able to\u000a      offer access to this resource to a wide range of school, college and\u000a      university students, as well as\u000a      other interested parties.\u000a    Influencing understanding and provoking debate amongst foxhunting\u000a          groups\u000a    Marvin's research on cultural aspects both of foxhunting, and of the\u000a      hunting of animals more\u000a      generally, has also had significant impact. Throughout the research\u000a      process, Marvin has had\u000a      access to a number of foxhunting communities in the UK. As well as these\u000a      groups being engaged\u000a      through research, a number of the resultant book chapters and journal\u000a      articles have been\u000a      circulated prior to key strategy and policy meetings, and have provoked\u000a      and contributed to debate.\u000a      New research insights into foxhunting as intangible cultural heritage, and\u000a      the effects of the Hunting\u000a      Act of 2004on rural communities, have contributed to these individuals and\u000a      groups placing their\u000a      own hunting practices and traditions in a different socio-cultural\u000a      context. For example, Captain\u000a      Brian Fanshawe, a senior member of the Council of Hunting Associations,\u000a      has drawn on Marvin's\u000a      research, particularly on the \"perception of the living human to animal\u000a        relationship that exists\u000a        between huntsman, hound and the quarry and, second, to his vision of the\u000a        community aspect of\u000a        hunt followers `belonging' to their local hunt\" which has changed\u000a      his own views \"on how foxhunting\u000a        might be conceived and perceived by others\". As a result, Marvin was\u000a      invited to discussions on the\u000a      group's policy strategies, as his analysis of foxhunting as a ritual\u000a      community event that is openly\u000a      accountable, and the nature of the relationships that constitute its\u000a      parts, were viewed to have been\u000a      particularly pertinent and helpful in explaining hunting to the public,\u000a      media and politicians.\u000a    Stephen Lambert, Chairman of the Masters of Foxhounds Association, the\u000a      controlling authority of\u000a      UK foxhunting, has confirmed the broader influence of this work, stating\u000a      that \"...my colleagues\u000a        have made use of this work in discussions and in their writings\".\u000a      Similarly, James Barrington, a\u000a      prominent animal welfare consultant in parliament, has drawn extensively\u000a      on Marvin's research in\u000a      political briefings and lobbying. Following the circulation of Marvin's\u000a      research at meetings of the\u000a      Masters of Foxhounds Association and the Countryside Alliance, his\u000a      insights were incorporated\u000a      into campaign material produced by the Countryside Alliance in seeking the\u000a      repeal of the hunting\u000a      ban in 2011(http:\/\/www.countryside-alliance.org.uk\/ca\/file\/Case_for_Repeal_2011.pdf).\u000a    Preservation and creative presentation of cultural heritage\u000a    The third element of Marvin's impact relates to his research into the\u000a      public exhibition of animals by\u000a      taxidermists and in zoos; this has led to significant changes in the\u000a      preservation and creative\u000a      presentation of cultural heritage.\u000a    Since 2010, Marvin has acted in an advisory position as a trustee of the\u000a      Powell-Cotton Museum at\u000a      Quex Park in Kent. He has drawn on his research on the cultural status of\u000a      taxidermised animals to\u000a      advise on several aspects of the museum's collections, in particular on\u000a      its anthropological\u000a      significance and the cultural understanding of taxidermy in different\u000a      contexts. This has had a direct\u000a      impact on the management of the collection, as indicated by Karen Botha,\u000a      the director of the\u000a      museum: \"his knowledge has influenced my approach to the management of\u000a        our collection\". It has\u000a      also \"transformed [the] team's awareness of how taxidermy is perceived\u000a        in various communities\".\u000a      Ultimately, this work has influenced the organisation's understanding of\u000a      the relevance and\u000a      importance of its collection. This understanding has, in turn, had a\u000a      significant impact on the\u000a      museum, and has led to the creation and appointment of two new posts in\u000a      2011 &#8212; a specialist\u000a      taxidermist to maintain the collection and a new collections manager.\u000a    More recently Marvin's research has been utilised in creative contexts.\u000a      In April 2013, he was\u000a      approached by Andy Hall, the producer for the BBC documentary series Timeshift.\u000a      He was aware\u000a      of Marvin's publications on zoo animals and approached him to contribute\u000a      to the programme in\u000a      May 2013. This consultation directly informed the content and form of the\u000a      documentary in terms of\u000a      changing perceptions of zoo animals and the cultural significance of zoos.\u000a      The documentary was\u000a      broadcast on BBC Four in November 2013.\u000a    Similarly, Marvin was approached by Bill Mitchell, the artistic director\u000a      of the international theatre\u000a      company WildWorks, to consult on the production of their performance CHIMERA\u000a      in spring 2013.\u000a      This arose after members of WildWorks had drawn insights from Marvin's Wolf\u000a      on human-animal\u000a      transformations, in particular that of the werewolf. Following initial\u000a      consultation, Marvin provided\u000a      detailed feedback, informed by his own research, to develop and refine the\u000a      project, and the\u000a      company's understanding and approach to human-animal interactions more\u000a      broadly. This also\u000a      included advice based on Marvin's knowledge of the processes and\u000a      performance of hunting, which\u000a      fed directly into the production, and is contributing to the ongoing\u000a      development of WildWorks'\u000a      practice beyond July 2013. Significantly, the theatre company is now\u000a      presenting cultural heritage in\u000a      a more accurate manner following this consultation, and to a wide public\u000a      audience.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study details the impact of Marvin's ethnographic\u000a      anthropological research into human-animal\u000a      relations, which places animals in cultural and historical context. This\u000a      work has been\u000a      foundational for the establishment of the new field of human-animal\u000a      studies and has led to impact\u000a      in three distinct areas. Through publications and direct public\u000a      engagement, this work has had an\u000a      impact on public understanding of the wolf, and on a body working for its\u000a      conservation. The\u000a      process of research and subsequent dissemination of publications on\u000a      foxhunting has provoked\u000a      debate and influenced the understanding of foxhunting groups. Finally,\u000a      through a collaborative\u000a      approach, research on the public exhibition of animals by taxidermists and\u000a      in zoos has enhanced\u000a      the preservation and creative presentation of cultural heritage.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Roehampton\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Roehampton University","InstitutionName":"Roehampton University","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007776}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"6167865","Name":"Toronto"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aMarvin, G (2012) Wolf, Reaktion Press: London.\u000a    \u000a\u000aMarvin, G (2011) Enlivened through memory: hunters and hunting trophies.\u000a      Pages 202 - 217, in\u000a      The Afterlives of Animals. ed.

Since joining Roehampton in 1996, he\u000a      has used ethnographic\u000a      anthropological fieldwork, supplemented by literary and historical\u000a      research, to explore key\u000a      questions relating to the interactions between humans and animals in a\u000a      broad range of contexts.\u000a      Underpinning this case study is a body of work related to cultural\u000a      constructions of the wolf; fox\u000a      hunting; the presentation of animals in zoos; and taxidermy in museums and\u000a      as hunting trophies.\u000a      Marvin's wolf research has mainly developed from literary sources, but two\u000a      fieldwork trips to\u000a      shepherding communities in Albania and in-depth discussions with wolf\u000a      experts in Norway and\u000a      hunters in Spain have been crucial to the development of his approaches to\u000a      understanding human-wolf\u000a      conflict. This research has explored how the wolf is culturally\u000a      constructed in different societies\u000a      and how the wolf has been responded to in terms of these cultural images.\u000a      A key argument\u000a      developed is that those interested in promoting the\u000a      conservation\/reintroduction of wolves must pay\u000a      attention to the wolf as a creation of culture as much as they pay\u000a      attention to its ecology and\u000a      ethology.\u000a    Marvin's ethnographic fieldwork with English foxhunting communities began\u000a      ten years ago and\u000a      continues on a regular basis during the season with Hunts in Surrey and\u000a      Shropshire. The aim of\u000a      this research has been to explore the cultural and social complexity of\u000a      this form of hunting. In\u000a      particular, Marvin has focussed on the performative and ritual nature of\u000a      hunting. He has also\u000a      considered how those who come together for hunting events form a community\u000a      beyond the actual\u000a      practice of hunting. Both these aspects &#8212; hunting as a ritual drama, and\u000a      hunting as a key element\u000a      of socially significant rural communities &#8212; have fed into how the hunting\u000a      world seeks to present\u000a      itself to the outside world.\u000a    For his work on how animals are represented in zoos, Marvin originally\u000a      conducted short research\u000a      trips to zoos in more than 20 countries. More recently he has developed\u000a      his research through visits\u000a      to zoos in Bristol and London. Central to this work is a consideration of\u000a      how changes in zoo\u000a      architecture can be interpreted as representing changing attitudes to the\u000a      natural world, how the\u000a      exhibition of animals in zoos has responded to concerns about animal\u000a      welfare and captivity, and\u000a      how visitor experiences of, and attitudes to, animals in zoos are shaped\u000a      by popular media\u000a      representations of animals.\u000a    Marvin's research interests in the experiences of recreational hunters\u000a      and the significance of\u000a      taxidermised hunting trophies have developed in the context of participant\u000a      observation,\u000a      accompanying deer and wild boar hunters on dozens of hunts in England and\u000a      Spain. This research\u000a      has been supplemented by interviews with hunters and hunt organisers at\u000a      hunting fairs in Spain,\u000a      with hunt organisers in South Africa and also by interviews with\u000a      taxidermists. The central aim of\u000a      this research is an exploration of hunting as a more encompassing activity\u000a      or event than the\u000a      shooting of animals. In terms of the creation of taxidermised trophies,\u000a      Marvin's interest has been in\u000a      how hunters wish the animals they have killed to be taxidermised and the\u000a      nature of the art and\u000a      craft of taxidermists in creating representations of dead animals that\u000a      transmit a sense of\u000a      `lifefulness'. Intimately connected with this is his view that the\u000a      trophies of the hunters with whom he\u000a      works do not represent trophies of masculinity but rather are `sites of\u000a      memory' that become the\u000a      focus of hunters' stories about their connections with, and experiences\u000a      of, the natural world. The\u000a      related issues of the art and craft of taxidermised animals and the nature\u000a      of the narratives that are\u000a      generated by them have reframed discussions about the status of taxidermy\u000a      collections in\u000a      museums and other public spaces.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20467","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2411586","Name":"Gibraltar"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The three key papers underpinning this case study provide novel insights\u000a      into the potentially detrimental effects of tourism on wild primates.\u000a      Findings have been communicated to a diverse audience of non-academic\u000a      parties, have informed development of evidence-based guidelines relating\u000a      to Barbary macaque tourism in Morocco, and to primate tourism generally,\u000a      and have provided the basis for the regulatory framework and impetus to\u000a      implement mitigation measures.\u000a    Promoting the research to enhance public understanding\u000a    Following a proactive and focussed press engagement campaign in June\u000a      2011, designed to maximise the reach of our communication, the research in\u000a      Mar&#233;chal et al.

We contributed a blog\u000a      piece on this work to the Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation, an\u000a      organisation working to conserve Barbary macaques in their native habitat.\u000a      In addition, we wrote material about our research for the website of\u000a      Trentham Monkey Forest, a conservation park holding a free ranging captive\u000a      population of Barbary macaques (Stoke-on-Trent, UK).Following a meeting\u000a      with the Director of Trentham Monkey Forest in April 2013 to discuss our\u000a      findings in relation to effects of tourism on wild Barbary macaques, the\u000a      results of these studies have since that time been included in the\u000a      educational talks at the park given to school, college and university\u000a      students as well as members of the general public.\u000a    Informing guidelines for primate tourism &#8212; Barbary macaques\u000a          (Morocco and Gibraltar)\u000a    Following an invitation from the Moroccan Primate Conservation\u000a      Foundation, Semple contributed to the Conservation Action Plan\u000a        for the Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) in Morocco, a plan\u000a      drawn up for the Moroccan government by organisations including government\u000a      authorities (Minist&#232;res de l'Agriculture et de la P&#234;che Maritime; Haut\u000a      Commissariat des Eaux et For&#234;ts), conservation NGOs (International\u000a      Federation of Animal Welfare, Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation),\u000a      and academic institutions (Institut Scientifique de Rabat, Centre National\u000a      de la Recherche Foresti&#232;re, University of Roehampton). This Action Plan\u000a      was drafted following a meeting in Azrou, Morocco, in October 2011. Semple\u000a      attended this meeting to describe the key findings of our research on\u000a      tourism, and to facilitate the translation of these findings into the\u000a      practical recommendations of the Action Plan. The final Action Plan\u000a      detailed a number of activities to reduce human impacts on Barbary macaque\u000a      populations, including specific recommendations related to mitigating\u000a      impacts of tourism that were based on our research findings outlined\u000a      above. The Plan is now being implemented by government authorities and\u000a      conservation NGOs in Morocco.\u000a    Semple was invited to a meeting in Azrou in January 2013, to\u000a      discuss development of tourism related to wild Barbary macaques in\u000a      Morocco. This invitation was from the Director of Ifrane National Park\u000a      (where our field studies were carried out), who explicitly expressed an\u000a      interest in hearing about the research findings in the three core studies\u000a      underpinning this case study. The meeting was attended by senior officials\u000a      from Ifrane National Park and from Haut Commissariat des Eaux et\u000a      For&#234;ts,and by representatives from regional tourism organisations and\u000a      environmental associations. A presentation and contribution to panel\u000a      discussions by Semple provided attending parties with information\u000a      and empirical evidence about the potential negative effects of tourism on\u000a      wild Barbary macaques, and how such effects may be avoided.\u000a    Since May 2012, Semple and MacLarnon have been\u000a      collaborating with the Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation as it\u000a      develops a new eco-tourism project &#8212; Monkey Watch &#8212; in Ifrane\u000a      National Park, Morocco. The Foundation have drawn on our research on\u000a      primate tourism throughout the early planning stages of this project, and\u000a      we have worked closely with them to ensure all appropriate steps are being\u000a      taken to avoid negative effects on wild Barbary macaques of this new\u000a      tourism venture.\u000a    In April 2013, Semple was invited by the Minister for Health and\u000a      Environment in the Gibraltar Government, Dr John Cortes, to join a panel\u000a      to advise on matters relating to the conservation and management of the\u000a      Barbary macaque population in Gibraltar. Interactions between tourists and\u000a      macaques are extremely frequent in Gibraltar and represent a key issue for\u000a      the management of this population. Semple is providing expertise\u000a      on this matter, and on others relating to conservation and management of\u000a      these animals, in support of the Gibraltar Barbary Macaque Management\u000a      Team.\u000a    Informing guidelines for primate tourism &#8212; general\u000a    Semple was invited to contribute to the Association of British\u000a      Travel Agents (ABTA) Global Welfare Guidance for Animals in Tourism\u000a      (ABTA, 2013). He provided material on the welfare implications of wildlife\u000a      viewing, covering three areas of tourist impact on primate welfare:\u000a      impacts on stress levels, behavioural change and disease risk. For these,\u000a      all three core studies described above were used to highlight key issues\u000a      and contribute to the guidelines proposed as means to mitigate tourism\u000a      impacts on wild primates. The findings of these studies were used as\u000a      systematic evidence to inform the report's primary recommendations on the\u000a      need to: 1. enforce a minimum tourist distance from wild primates; 2.\u000a      prevent any physical interaction, even `low level' forms, between tourists\u000a      and primates; 3. mitigate or minimise the effects of tourist presence\u000a      and\/or behaviour on primates. The Global Welfare Guidance for Animals\u000a        in Tourism was launched in June 2013. Key ABTA Member organisations\u000a      &#8212; TUI Travel, Thomas Cook, Virgin Holidays and Cosmos &#8212; have committed to\u000a      using these guidelines to ensure that any wildlife tourism attractions\u000a      that are offered in their holidays meet the minimum benchmark\u000a      requirements. In addition, ABTA is distributing this document to\u000a      governments and tourist boards in destination countries, and it is\u000a      available to ABTA's 1,200 member organisations.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study details the impact of a body of research exploring the\u000a      effects of tourism on wild primates.

Using the endangered\u000a      Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco\u000a      as a model system, we have applied a range of non-invasive techniques to\u000a      assess emotional and physical effects of tourism on these animals. Despite\u000a      clear concerns about the effects of human presence and behaviour on the\u000a      well-being of tourist-exposed primates, to date systematic data on this\u000a      issue have been extremely limited. A number of the approaches or lines of\u000a      evidence we have used to assess such effects draw on a complementary body\u000a      of research exploring fundamental questions related to primate social\u000a      behaviour, stress and well-being. Here, we describe the three studies\u000a      directly exploring tourism effects on wild primates that underpin this\u000a      case study, as well as the more fundamental studies on which these draw.\u000a    (1) Mar&#233;chal et al. (2011)- this study\u000a      explored effects of interactions with tourists on wild Barbary macaques,\u000a      using behavioural measures of anxiety and non-invasive hormonal measures\u000a      of the physiological stress response. Use of these two different measures\u000a      was prompted by evidence from an earlier study by our group (Higham et\u000a        al. 2009) that they reflect different aspects of the overall stress\u000a      response in primates. Two key findings emerged from the work of Mar&#233;chal et\u000a        al. (2011). Firstly, even very `low level' primate-tourist\u000a      interactions, such as tourists photographing the macaques, were associated\u000a      with a significant elevation in the animals' anxiety levels. Secondly,\u000a      aggressive interactions between macaques and tourists were linked to\u000a      higher levels of stress hormones, indicating a chronic physiological\u000a      response by the animals.\u000a    (2) Majolo et al. (2013) &#8212; in this\u000a      chapter, we presented new data indicating that feeding of wild Barbary\u000a      macaques by tourists dramatically increased levels of intra-specific\u000a      aggression, and that close proximity of tourists reduced rates of social\u000a      grooming. Separate research on free-ranging groups of Barbary macaques in\u000a      the UK provided evidence that elevations of aggression are indicative of\u000a      underlying increases in stress (Gustison et al. 2012), and that\u000a      social grooming has an important function in mediating social\u000a      relationships (Carne et al. 2011) and hence that disruption of\u000a      normal grooming patterns may have detrimental social consequences.\u000a    (3) Borg et al. (2013) &#8212; this study\u000a      provided evidence that exposure to tourism was linked to significantly\u000a      greater body fatness, poorer coat condition and higher diversity of\u000a      protozoan parasites among wild Barbary macaques. All three of these\u000a      factors have been linked in the literature to poor health in animals.\u000a    In summary, the three studies that form the core of this case study\u000a      provide evidence that exposure to tourism increases wild primates' anxiety\u000a      and physiological stress levels, has detrimental effects on their social\u000a      behaviour, and leads to increased body weight, poorer body condition and\u000a      higher parasite load.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23993","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Judges in asylum cases require detailed information about conditions in\u000d\u000a      asylum seekers' countries of origin.

Through\u000d\u000a      the provision of expert evidence, Edinburgh researchers have been a\u000d\u000a      central part in the decision- making in hundreds of asylum cases.\u000d\u000a      Researchers have also provided training and advice on the assessment and\u000d\u000a      use of expert evidence to asylum practitioners. The research has therefore\u000d\u000a      impacted on legal practice, shaped the implementation of\u000d\u000a      immigration and asylum policy, and had an effect on the quality of\u000d\u000a      the decision-making process, as well as helping to define best\u000d\u000a        practice.\u000d\u000a    Informing individual decision-making. Work by members of the UoA\u000d\u000a      has played a significant role in individual cases in the immigration and\u000d\u000a      asylum process. Members of the UoA have produced reports in over 700\u000d\u000a      asylum cases (usually of a length between 30 and 60 pages) as well as\u000d\u000a      giving expert oral evidence at dozens of asylum hearings. Good, Kelly,\u000d\u000a      Spencer and Fontein have national reputations as providers of country of\u000d\u000a      evidence. Collectively, they are recognised as among the most significant\u000d\u000a      providers of expert COI in the UK (see corroborating sources 5.1, 5.2).\u000d\u000a      Good, for example, has been described in a determination by a High Court\u000d\u000a      judge as `well known' (5.3). Kelly has been described by a leading asylum\u000d\u000a      lawyer as an `outstanding, and outstandingly useful, country background\u000d\u000a      witness', whose reports are `factually unchallenged', and is the `expert\u000d\u000a      of choice in Palestinian appeals' for asylum lawyers as `his objectivity\u000d\u000a      and detail are valued by the immigration judiciary' (5.2). The reports\u000d\u000a      produced by Edinburgh researchers have helped to decide, given the nature\u000d\u000a      of asylum cases, on matters of life and death. A leading asylum solicitor,\u000d\u000a      who has instructed over 30 reports from Good has written that `I do not\u000d\u000a      think that one of my clients about whom he has produced these reports has\u000d\u000a      been removed ... He has saved many lives . .The mere fact he has provided\u000d\u000a      a report can sometimes be enough ... to enable one of my...clients to win\u000d\u000a      their asylum case' (see corroborating source 5.1).\u000d\u000a    Evidence provided by Good, Kelly, Fontein and Spencer has frequently been\u000d\u000a      cited by judges in important High Court cases, reported Tribunal\u000d\u000a      determinations, and Country Guidance cases (see, for example, 5.3, 5.4).\u000d\u000a      In 2011, Fontein has also provided expert evidence on Zimbabwe during a\u000d\u000a      high-profile criminal trial involving witchcraft allegations. Good also\u000d\u000a      provides expert evidence for appeals in Canada, USA, Switzerland and\u000d\u000a      Australia, as well as a generic report on Sri Lanka for the French NGO\u000d\u000a      CIMADE, which has been extensively used at the Cour National du Droit\u000d\u000a      d'Asile.\u000d\u000a    The nature of the judicial decision-making process, revealed by Good and\u000d\u000a      Kelly's own work, means that expert reports are often not directly cited\u000d\u000a      in determinations. However, the fact that they are commissioned in the\u000d\u000a      first place indicates their impact among lawyers: legal aid requirements\u000d\u000a      mean that reports cannot be commissioned unless they potentially make a\u000d\u000a      material difference to the outcome.\u000d\u000a    Informing professional practice. Work by members of the UoA has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the professional practice, knowledge and skills of\u000d\u000a      decision-makers and those people representing asylum seekers. In the\u000d\u000a      highly polarised context of asylum decision-making, Good and Kelly's\u000d\u000a      research adds depth to understandings of the nature, strengths, and limits\u000d\u000a      of the various forms of expert evidence available in the asylum process,\u000d\u000a      understandings which are otherwise often either one-dimensional and\u000d\u000a      legalistic, or overly politicised. Amongst anthropologists, Good's work\u000d\u000a      increased awareness of the importance of expert evidence, and encouraged\u000d\u000a      many academics to offer their expertise. Equally importantly, it helped\u000d\u000a      them understand how to write expert reports without falling into traps\u000d\u000a      that would lead to them being dismissed by decision-makers as politically\u000d\u000a      motivated or irrelevant. Whilst practitioners may not always agree with\u000d\u000a      Kelly and Good's findings, dissemination of their work has informed or\u000d\u000a        stimulated practitioner debate, and challenged conventional\u000d\u000a        wisdom among stakeholders.\u000d\u000a    Good, Fontein, and Kelly have convened a series of workshops bringing\u000d\u000a      practitioners and academic together to discuss the challenges and\u000d\u000a      potentials of the production and assessment of expert evidence. In March\u000d\u000a      2009 Good co-convened a workshop on asylum processes attended by 15 senior\u000d\u000a      judges, lawyers, interpreters, NGO executives, and judicial and\u000d\u000a      ministerial officials from France and the UK. Participants reflected\u000d\u000a      critically and comparatively on their professional activities with a view\u000d\u000a      to developing `best practice'. The workshops were described by Head of the\u000d\u000a      Legal Information Centre at the CNDA (French National Court of Asylum) as\u000d\u000a      a `rich exchange', and as `excellent' by the Chief Executive of an\u000d\u000a      immigration law charity (5.9). In April 2011, Kelly co-convened a workshop\u000d\u000a      examining the use of evidence in asylum claims, involving over 20\u000d\u000a      immigration lawyers, clinicians from Freedom from Torture, civil society\u000d\u000a      campaigners from the Scottish Refugee Council, immigration judges, and\u000d\u000a      UKBA officials. Fontein convened a workshop in 2013 involving 12 police\u000d\u000a      officers, social workers and expert witnesses looking at the professional\u000d\u000a      challenges involved in producing legal evidence around witchcraft\u000d\u000a      allegations. All three workshops provided rare opportunities for\u000d\u000a      practitioners from different parts of an often antagonistic process to\u000d\u000a      discuss their mutual concerns.\u000d\u000a    Kelly was a keynote speaker at a workshop attended by over 60 human\u000d\u000a      rights practitioners on bridging the gap between research and practice at\u000d\u000a      Dignity: Danish Institute Against Torture- one of the largest anti-torture\u000d\u000a      NGOs in the world. Following this presentation he discussed the\u000d\u000a      implications of his book This Side of Silence, in a public forum\u000d\u000a      with practitioners (see 5.6). In response to this discussion, a senior\u000d\u000a      anti-torture activist has written about Kelly's 2012 book that `few\u000d\u000a      contemporary books are more relevant to the prevention of torture' (5.8).\u000d\u000a    Edinburgh researchers have provided training and guidance for lawyers and\u000d\u000a      decision-makers involved in the asylum process. As such they have influenced\u000a        professional guidelines or training and the development of\u000d\u000a        resources to enhance professional practice'. Good acted as advisor\u000d\u000a      for the sections on expert witnesses in both editions of the Best Practice\u000d\u000a      Guide to Asylum Appeals, the practitioners' desk manual (see 5.5). He has\u000d\u000a      provided practitioner training sessions for the Immigration Advisory\u000d\u000a      Service and Freedom from Torture (FfT), was a member of the Reference\u000d\u000a      Group for the Ministry of Justice's Expert Witness Fees Project, and a\u000d\u000a      founder member of the Advisory Panel for the Office of the Immigration\u000d\u000a      Services Commissioner, which accredits providers of immigration advice.\u000d\u000a      Kelly has also created training material for FfT's induction process for\u000d\u000a      new employees and volunteers. Kelly and Good, working with lawyers\u000d\u000a      suggested by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, have produced\u000d\u000a      a widely distributed Best Practice Guide for Expert Witnesses, which,\u000d\u000a      according to the Chief Executive of a leading asylum organization, is\u000d\u000a      `regarded as a valuable tool by both experts and those who wish to\u000d\u000a      instruct them', (5.10). The Guide is distributed through the Refugee Legal\u000d\u000a      Group and the Electronic Immigration Network, the leading sources of\u000d\u000a      information for asylum and immigration practitioners (5.12). As an\u000d\u000a      indicator of the esteem with which the guide is held, it is being\u000d\u000a      submitted as part of the evidence in a UK Supreme Court cases challenging\u000d\u000a      the Home Office's use of expert evidence (5.2)\u000d\u000a    Public debate. Kelly and Good have also contributed to broader\u000d\u000a      public discussions about difficulties in documenting torture. For example,\u000d\u000a      in 2011 Al-Jazeera commissioned an opinion piece from Kelly on the\u000d\u000a      documentation of torture, which was picked up by the international press\u000d\u000a      (see 5.7, 5.11), whilst Good spoke in 2013 at a meeting in the House of\u000d\u000a      Lords on torture in Sri Lanka.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Since the mid 1990s, Social Anthropology staff have provided expert\u000d\u000a      advice as part of UK asylum procedures.

Kelly has\u000d\u000a      been a lecturer in Edinburgh since 2005, and his research on citizenship\u000d\u000a      and residency in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (2008) has enabled him\u000d\u000a      to work as an expert witness, as rights of return are often central to\u000d\u000a      Palestinian asylum claims. Spencer, at Edinburgh since 1990, has been\u000d\u000a      carrying out long-term research on the causes and consequences of the\u000d\u000a      30-year conflict in Sri Lanka (2011). Good, at Edinburgh since 1980, has\u000d\u000a      conducted several fact-finding visits with immigration lawyers to assess\u000d\u000a      the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, producing reports for use as\u000d\u000a      generic evidence in asylum cases. Fontein, at Edinburgh since 2004, has\u000d\u000a      researched the post-colonial state in Zimbabwe, and conflict over land and\u000d\u000a      water resources in particular (2010), issues central to the claims of many\u000d\u000a      Zimbabwean asylum seekers.\u000d\u000a    Research has also taken place on the use of expert witness evidence in\u000d\u000a      the asylum process itself. Good and Kelly have both carried out separate,\u000d\u000a      but related research on asylum procedures, focusing on differences between\u000d\u000a      various forms of expert knowledge, and the ways in which these different\u000d\u000a      forms of knowledge can be put to best use.\u000d\u000a    Good's research, funded by the AHRC in 2000, assessed the role of expert\u000d\u000a      evidence in legal processes associated with asylum appeals and explored\u000d\u000a      the professional and ethical dilemmas posed by such work. Later work,\u000d\u000a      funded by the AHRC in 2006 looked comparatively (France and the UK), at\u000d\u000a      how lawyers translate asylum applicants' narratives into legal discourses\u000d\u000a      and the effect this has on the types of claim that can be made for asylum.\u000d\u000a      Good (2007) was the first ethnographically-based account of the UK asylum\u000d\u000a      decision-making process. It exposes the different ways in which\u000d\u000a      immigration practitioners and academics understand key terms and concepts,\u000d\u000a      and therefore how the two groups can better communicate with one another.\u000d\u000a    Kelly's (2012) research, funded by the ESRC in 2008-11, explored the\u000d\u000a      dilemmas and problems involved in documenting and assessing evidence about\u000d\u000a      torture. As most claims about torture in UK courts are made during asylum\u000d\u000a      claims, the research focused heavily on asylum and immigration tribunals.\u000d\u000a      It also involved participant observation with torture rehabilitation\u000d\u000a      organisations, as well as interviews with clinicians, lawyers, judges and\u000d\u000a      case-workers. Kelly argues that for individual claimants a focus on\u000d\u000a      torture can be counter-productive, as it raises the political and moral\u000d\u000a      stakes, which can seldom be met by the often necessarily limited evidence\u000d\u000a      available. Seemingly more mundane and less charged descriptions of\u000d\u000a      violence may therefore be more pragmatically useful for claimants, but\u000d\u000a      also more helpful for decision-makers as they provide greater specificity.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23994","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    If the global community is to meet the UN Secretary General's goal of\u000a      providing `Sustainable Energy for All by 2030', then alternative sources\u000a      of energy &#8212; whether from natural biomass, purpose-grown biofuels, or\u000a      photovoltaic solar technologies &#8212; will be part of the solution. Smith,\u000a      Cross and Pradhan are using the findings from individual and collaborative\u000a      research projects to meet the challenge of future energy access in East\u000a      Africa and South Asia. The researchers have provided policymakers in those\u000a      countries with new information and approaches that they can apply to\u000a      unlock the potential of bioenergy and solar power to improve energy access\u000a      and livelihoods in poor communities. Impact has therefore come through shaping\u000a        and influencing policy made by government, quasi-government bodies, NGOs\u000a        and private organisations, stimulating public debate, and in\u000a      facilitating the direct provision of energy sources.\u000a    Supporting Policy. Research findings have helped shape domestic\u000a      and international policy making on bioenergy. The clearest evidence has\u000a      been the central role of the PISCES project, at the invitation of the\u000a      Kenyan and Tanzanian governments, in the establishment of\u000a      multi-stakeholder policy working groups (for corroboration see 5.1).\u000a      Building on research insights into the importance of multiple stakeholder\u000a      input for the effectiveness of alternative energy policy (Smith 2010),\u000a      PISCES led the creation of a bioenergy Policy Working Groups (PWG) in\u000a      Kenya and Tanzania (2009-2012). In Kenya, for example, the PWG was chaired\u000a      by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Energy, with members from\u000a      government, NGOs, bilateral donors and business. A similar process is\u000a      underway in Sri Lanka, albeit at an earlier stage. PWGs seek to develop a\u000a      consultative and participatory policy methodology to discuss and guide\u000a      bioenergy policy. Members of the Kenya PWG established by PISCES were\u000a      instrumental in the writing of the country's National Biofuel Policy,\u000a      approved by the Ministry of Energy. Under the new Kenya constitution\u000a      promulgated in 2011, the draft Kenya National Biofuel Policy was\u000a      integrated into the draft Kenya Energy Policy 2013, which is currently\u000a      awaiting approval by the new Parliament (5.1). PISCES involvement led to a\u000a      policy formulation process that involved a diversity of stakeholders, in\u000a      particular, civil society.\u000a    Improved clean energy access. The above policy interventions have\u000a      had an impact on the use of alternative clean energy sources. Although\u000a      precise measurement in Global South conditions is very difficult, PISCES\u000a      estimates that it has improved clean energy access and livelihoods via\u000a      bioenergy for approximately 180,000 people in Kenya, India, Sri Lanka and\u000a      Tanzania. It did so, for example, by bringing together stakeholders to\u000a      facilitate the translation of basic science into marketable technologies\u000a      in East Africa. As a direct result of these forums, training and market\u000a      mapping, PISCES has facilitated the distribution and use of 30,000\u000a      efficient gassifier stoves. The figure of 180,000 people is based on the\u000a      assumption that each stove serves a household of six people (see 5.3 for\u000a      details).\u000a    In March 2013, in partnership with the Microloan Foundation, Cross and\u000a      Smith were awarded &#163;377,304 by the Scottish Government. The grant was a\u000a      practical recognition of the importance of Cross's insights into the\u000a      effective take up of solar energy amongst poor populations. A significant\u000a      slice of the project focuses on supporting `solar entrepreneurs' &#8212; women\u000a      who sell photovoltaic panels to provide lighting, phone and battery\u000a      charging to improve the lives and livelihoods of 15,000 female clients in\u000a      Malawi (5.4).\u000a    Informing Practitioners. Research has directly informed\u000a      professional debates and practices through expert contributions to\u000a      practitioner-led networks on biofuels and solar photovoltaics. In 2011, as\u000a      a result of the recognition of the importance of his work on science,\u000a      technology and development, Smith was appointed as a technology and\u000a      development specialist to the board of Practical Action, the leading INGO\u000a      working on the role of technology for development and sustainable energy\u000a      provision. Smith's role is to contribute to their notion of `technological\u000a      justice' as an advocacy tool, taking advantage of Smith's expertise in\u000a      influencing debates around equitable access to technology and thus\u000a      expanding their developmental reach. Meanwhile, in March 2013 Cross was\u000a      appointed as a Technical Advisor to the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition\u000a      (SVTC), a leading INGO engaged in research and advocacy in the global\u000a      solar industry. His key contribution has been to support SVTC's Solar\u000a      Scorecard, an initiative that holds manufacturers and suppliers publically\u000a      accountable by monitoring sustainability and social justice issues in\u000a      their supply chains.\u000a    Research capacity-building programmes and training workshops have created\u000a      additional practitioner impact. According to the Director of Research at\u000a      the African Centre of Technology Studies Institute in Nairobi &#8212; the\u000a      leading African think tank on science and development &#8212; this work has\u000a      `contributed significantly to the capacity building and training\u000a      initiatives` of the centre (see 5.5). Smith has contributed to the\u000a      training of 1349 bioenergy development stakeholders in the UK, East Africa\u000a      and Sri Lanka (5.11). As part of this process, small-scale bioenergy\u000a      projects supervised by Smith for the UN's Food and Agriculture\u000a      Organization (FAO), for example, have led to an influential report which\u000a      has provoked practitioner debates about the tensions between small-scale\u000a      and large-scale bioenergy provision at the FAO (see 5.6).\u000a    Engaging Publics. Research has broadened public understandings of\u000a      science and technology in international development. It has done so\u000a      through challenging existing development practice, raising new questions\u000a      about the political economy of technological innovation and global social\u000a      entrepreneurship, and by holding business practices up to scrutiny. In the\u000a      UK, Smith drafted a chapter on `Ethical Principles and Biofuels Policy'\u000a      for the Nuffield Council's 2010 report, Biofuels: Ethical Issues,\u000a      which was the first public report to set out principles on which biofuel\u000a      policy should be based (see 5.7). The reports recommendations have been\u000a      strongly reflected in the `Bioenergy principles' set out in the UK\u000a      Government's Bioenergy Strategy, published in April 2012 (5.8). Further\u000a      public engagement includes: invited commentaries on the emergence of\u000a      biofuels in print, broadcast and online media (Smith), as well as at UK\u000a      public festivals of science (Smith); the organization of a public debate\u000a      on the ethics of market-based approaches to development at the University\u000a      of Oxford in May 2011, bringing together panelists and participants from\u000a      DFID, ODI, OXFAM, CARE, Unilever, and The Guardian (Cross); and the launch\u000a      of a web-based portal aimed at bringing academic research to\u000a      practitioners, http:\/\/www.responsiblebop.com\u000a      which has registred an average 500 unique user hits per day since June\u000a      2011 (Cross) (5.9).\u000a    Smith and Cross's research has also had direct impact on public advocacy\u000a      around biofuels and solar photovoltaics. Smith worked with Practical\u000a      Action and ActionAid to help establish public awareness of the political\u000a      economy of biofuels before it was generally recognized that they might be\u000a      socially, politically and environmentally problematic, and has fed into\u000a      pressure on the EU to reduce biofuel blending targets (5.2). In 2011-12\u000a      Cross worked with the SVTC and the Dutch Centre for Research on\u000a      Multinationals to establish Good Solar, an international network aimed at\u000a      bringing together social, labour, and environmental activists to\u000a      strengthen regulatory mechanisms in the global photovoltaic supply chain,\u000a      which represents one of the first &#8212; if not the first &#8212; attempt to\u000a      facilitate civil society networking, information exchange, capacity\u000a      building and joint strategy-making at the level of solar supply chains\u000a      (5.10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2007, Edinburgh researchers have played an important role in\u000a      increasing the use of local, context-specific knowledge in the assessment\u000a      of technological sustainability and efficiency in the bioenergy and solar\u000a      sectors in East Africa and South Asia.

Moreover, unsustainable sources of energy are\u000a      rapidly exacerbating existing tensions between growth, climate change and\u000a      poverty. Research in Edinburgh has produced context-specific ethnographic\u000a      evidence about the limits and potential of sustainable energy technologies\u000a      in East Africa and South Asia, focusing in particular on two of the most\u000a      promising, yet problematic, energy sectors: bioenergy and solar energy.\u000a    Bioenergy.

In particular, this work has highlighted the\u000a      importance of using appropriate methodologies (such as participatory\u000a      market mapping), developing detailed case studies of effective small-scale\u000a      bioenergy projects, and supporting multi-stakeholder policy forums in East\u000a      Africa. The combination of methods, evidence and networking are necessary\u000a      in order to understand the complex contexts in which new technologies\u000a      succeed or fail, the bases on which success or failure depend, and how\u000a      best to incorporate evidence into appropriate institutional and national\u000a      policy-making (Lyall et al, 2009; Pradhan and Ruysenar 2013; Smith 2010).\u000a    Solar energy. Cross's work has brought similar ethnographic\u000a      insights to bear on the effectiveness of affordable energy technologies,\u000a      this time with a focus on solar energy. Research at Edinburgh has been\u000a      supported by Cross's 3-year Early Career Fellowship from the Leverhulme\u000a      Trust (2011-14), for which Smith acts as mentor, and small grants from the\u000a      ESRC-EPSRC Interdisciplinary Network on Energy, Equity and Vulnerability\u000a      (2012). This research focuses on solar photovoltaic technology designed\u000a      for and sold to people living without electricity across Asia and Africa.\u000a      There have been two main insights produced through this research. First,\u000a      it has highlighted the importance of the relationships between\u000a      entrepreneurs, technologies, and poor consumers in creating new markets\u000a      for low-cost solar powered lighting systems (Cross 2013). Second, it has\u000a      highlighted the need for increased public scrutiny of labour and\u000a      environmental issues in the global supply chains for low cost renewable\u000a      energy technologies (Cross, 2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23995","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    TB is the second leading cause of death from infectious diseases\u000d\u000a      worldwide, with 95% of deaths occurring in the developing world. Harper's\u000d\u000a      research goes to the heart of the practical issues involved in the\u000d\u000a      implementation of TB control, and its impediments in terms of health\u000d\u000a      sector fragility, limited resources and vulnerable local populations.\u000d\u000a      Impacts have been cumulative, and emerge from both an expanding research\u000d\u000a      agenda, but also from a growing set of practice-based engagements with\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and practitioners. Through placing patient centred\u000d\u000a      approaches at the heart of policy and practice Harper's research\u000d\u000a      has had impact in the development of resources to enhance professional\u000d\u000a        practice, in particular by developing desk manuals. The research has\u000d\u000a      also influenced planning or management of services through\u000d\u000a      coordinating the Nepali government's Programme Management Unit, the\u000d\u000a      central mechanism for the assessment of Nepal's TB programmes. More\u000d\u000a      broadly Harper's research has been used by donors and governments to\u000d\u000a        define best practice.\u000d\u000a    Desk manuals. Harper's research directly contributed to the\u000d\u000a      content of the Tuberculosis Case Management Guideline for Health\u000d\u000a        Workers and Doctors (Desk Manual), published in Nepal in 2009. The\u000d\u000a      manual is the key reference for all health workers dealing with TB in\u000d\u000a      Nepal and is used in all 4,251 health institutions in the country. This\u000d\u000a      impact was facilitated by Harper's coordination of a 2007 review of the\u000d\u000a      Nepal Tuberculosis Programme on behalf of the International Union Against\u000d\u000a      Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and the WHO. Against this background, with\u000d\u000a      colleagues from Leeds, Harper directly contributed to the writing of the\u000d\u000a      2009 manual (5.2). Two key recommendations from Harper's review were\u000d\u000a      central to the manual. First, the manual followed a `patient-centred'\u000d\u000a      approach, taking into account how tuberculosis impacts on people's lives\u000d\u000a      in diverse and complex ways. Second, the manual permitted health workers\u000d\u000a      to adapt supervision and patient support to patients' circumstances. In\u000d\u000a      particular, Harper's 2006 JBS piece was directly referenced in the\u000d\u000a      manual's support of the recommendation that more flexible (rather than\u000d\u000a      institutional) support be made available to TB patients (5.1). The former\u000d\u000a      National Health Policy Advisor for the Department for International\u000d\u000a      Development in Nepal, described Harper's work on this project as being a\u000d\u000a      `champion who successfully brought the... voices of thousands of people\u000d\u000a      with tuberculosis, which were unheard, into the policy framework' (5.2).\u000d\u000a    Programme Management Unit. Harper's research has consistently\u000d\u000a      argued that TB control interventions need to attend to local circumstances\u000d\u000a      and qualitative evidence, if they aspire to be effective. In 2008, the\u000d\u000a      Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), which channels 82% of\u000d\u000a      all global financing to TB control, offered support to the Nepal\u000d\u000a      Government. One of the conditions of the grant was the creation of\u000d\u000a      appropriate local structures for implementation and monitoring. On the\u000d\u000a      basis of his earlier research into these local conditions, Harper was\u000d\u000a      seconded as Start-up Coordinator in the Nepal NTP from August to December\u000d\u000a      2008 at the joint request of the Government of Nepal and the WHO. The\u000d\u000a      Programme Management Unit is the central device for assessing the impact\u000d\u000a      of TB control mechanisms in Nepal. Harper designed the structure, wrote\u000d\u000a      the job descriptions, and created the assessment manuals. He was also\u000d\u000a      directly involved in planning for the procurement of TB drugs for the\u000d\u000a      Nepali national TB programme. The funding released as a consequence of\u000d\u000a      these new forms of monitoring, eventually totalled over $3.5m, and Harper\u000d\u000a      received a certificate of appreciation from the Nepal Government in\u000d\u000a      recognition of his contribution (5.3).\u000d\u000a    Harper's work with the Programme Management Unit in Nepal, led to him\u000d\u000a      playing a similar role in India. In 2009 Harper acted as a consultant with\u000d\u000a      Grant Management Solutions (GMS) working with the Indian Revised National\u000d\u000a      TB Control Programme to strengthen their monitoring and evaluation plan,\u000d\u000a      stressing the importance of qualitative context specific forms of\u000d\u000a      assessment (5.4). This work was another prerequisite for the release of a\u000d\u000a      $90m GFATM grant.\u000d\u000a    Increasing capacity around qualitative research. Harper's work has\u000d\u000a      played a central role in increasing capacity around the use of qualitative\u000d\u000a      evidence in the assessment of TB prevention strategies, both in Nepal and\u000d\u000a      more globally. On one level, this has meant producing qualitative evidence\u000d\u000a      itself. For example, Harper conducted an ethnographic survey of TB\u000d\u000a      services in Pokhara, Nepal for the NGO HERD in 2009. The survey allowed\u000d\u000a      more responsive planning for targeted interventions, with stronger links\u000d\u000a      between public and private sector, in the provision of TB medications and\u000d\u000a      support.\u000d\u000a    At another level, Harper has played a significant role providing\u000d\u000a      training, advice and increasing the professional recognition given to\u000d\u000a      qualitative research by practitioners. In 2012, for example, as part of\u000d\u000a      the Wellcome programme of research, Harper ran a workshop (with Professor\u000d\u000a      Roger Jeffery) with the NGO HERD on the use of qualitative\u000d\u000a      research. Nine organisations participated, and Nepal's first network\u000d\u000a      for qualitative research into the health sector was set up. In 2012 Harper\u000d\u000a      facilitated a workshop in Kathmandu for policy-makers and academics on\u000d\u000a      ethical review of health related research. He has also provided\u000d\u000a      methodological advice for the Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation,\u000d\u000a      Nepal (TPO) as they develop operational research into pyschopharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      markets in Nepal (5.10). More globally, through his role with the\u000d\u000a      practitioner based International Journal of TB and Lung Disease he\u000d\u000a      has also raised the profile on qualitative research in assessing the\u000d\u000a      impact of TB control programmes, and set new guidelines for scientific\u000d\u000a      standards in qualitative research into TB (5.5).\u000d\u000a    National and international development policy. Harper's insights\u000d\u000a      are widely recognised as important for the development of international\u000d\u000a      development policy. He has given talks on TB control to USAID and other\u000d\u000a      donors in Nepal. In 2010 Harper participated in workshops developing\u000d\u000a      policy paper positions on operational research in TB control for the WHO\u000d\u000a      (5.6), and in implementing new diagnostic technologies for the Gates\u000d\u000a        Foundation (5.7). In July 2012 he was invited to present a paper on\u000d\u000a      the regulation of pharmaceutical marketing at the Logistics Management\u000d\u000a      Division (LMD) in the Ministry of Health Nepal with participation from\u000d\u000a      DfID, the German development agency GTZ and the Nepali Department of Drug\u000d\u000a      Administration (DDA) (5.8). On the basis of Harper's research, DfID are\u000d\u000a      currently considering further investment into the Nepal DDA to assist in\u000d\u000a      the strengthening of their regulatory capacity (5.9).\u000d\u000a    Public debate.

This dual track approach has been at the\u000d\u000a      core of all his research and engagement. Harper's research has highlighted\u000d\u000a      the importance of context-specific social and political factors in\u000d\u000a      understanding how the disease is controlled, how patients respond, and how\u000d\u000a      drugs are made available. Whereas policy- makers and\u000d\u000a      programme-implementers often think of TB as simply a technical or medical\u000d\u000a      problem, Harper's research has provided strong empirical evidence for the\u000d\u000a      importance of social context in influencing the ways in which TB control\u000d\u000a      mechanisms are implemented and take effect.\u000d\u000a    Since arriving in Edinburgh in 2004, Harper has worked on an ethnographic\u000d\u000a      study of how the internationally recommended strategy for TB control, the\u000d\u000a      Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) programme, was translated\u000d\u000a      into local contexts. The research highlighted the importance of social\u000d\u000a      relationships and cultural assumptions for the effective diagnosis and\u000d\u000a      treatment of TB (2006, 2007). In doing so, one of the most significant\u000d\u000a      implications of the research has been to stress the importance of\u000d\u000a      qualitative methods in the assessment of TB programmes. The research\u000d\u000a      argued that the use of rigid definitional categories in the monitoring of\u000d\u000a      TB programmes marginalises some patients from treatment, and that\u000d\u000a      randomised controlled trials have important limitations in the assessment\u000d\u000a      of TB control effectiveness.\u000d\u000a    In 2006-2009, Harper concentrated on issues around the production,\u000d\u000a      marketing and distribution of anti-TB drugs, as part of a wider three-year\u000d\u000a      ESRC\/DfID multidisciplinary project on Tracing Pharmaceuticals in\u000d\u000a        South Asia. The research highlighted the importance of local\u000d\u000a      relationships of trust for the distribution of pharmaceuticals: trust of\u000d\u000a      the companies that make the drugs, of the clinic spaces that provide the\u000d\u000a      drugs, and of the relationships between pharmacists, retailers,\u000d\u000a      wholesalers and others (2010, 2011a, 2011b). One of the most significant\u000d\u000a      findings of the research was that any analysis of the potential\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of TB control regimes needs to take into account the\u000d\u000a      specific contexts of pharmaceutical production and distribution,\u000d\u000a      especially the relationship between private and public sector providers on\u000d\u000a      the ground.\u000d\u000a    Harper started work as a PI on a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Grant\u000d\u000a      in 2012.

The governance of such mining is a major\u000a      international issue due to growing concerns about transboundary pollution\u000a      and health inequality in mining areas, as well as the political\u000a      consequences of illegal extraction and livelihood constraints in poorer\u000a      countries. As attempts are made to produce environmentally and\u000a      economically sustainable forms of resource extraction in the global south,\u000a      it is of crucial importance that the livelihood concerns of small scale\u000a      and artisanal miners are not forgotten, not least to ensure the\u000a      effectiveness of any form of regulation. Spiegel's research has had an\u000a      impact in increasing the emphasis on artisanal mining in international and\u000a      national policy, as well as informing the content of that policy and the\u000a      design of effective implementation measures. Research has also had impact\u000a      in developing the capacity of grass roots organization to represent the\u000a      interests of artisanal miners. The relationship between research and\u000a      impact has been iterative and continuous, with practical engagement\u000a      feeding into research insights, and vice versa. Research has therefore had\u000a      an impact in improved management or conservation of natural resources\u000a        and environmental risk, the improved implementation of environmental\u000a        policy and regulation and stimulating policy debate.\u000a    International treaty negotiations. Spiegel's research has fed\u000a      directly into international negotiations over the regulation of mercury\u000a      use. For example, his research was included in a UNEP report that was\u000a      distributed to governments in Africa, Asia and South America during\u000a      multilateral talks for an international treaty to curtail mercury\u000a      pollution (for corroboration see 5.1). This case study on artisanal mining\u000a      and rural inequality was one of the five studies used during the\u000a      negotiation for the Minimata Convention on Mercury. The Convention was\u000a      adopted by over 140 countries in January 2013. Spiegel's research based\u000a      case study showed policymakers how a total ban on mercury could negatively\u000a      impact marginal livelihoods and could also be counterproductive by\u000a      increasing clandestine mercury use. Spiegel's case study was therefore a\u000a      crucial part of debates that led to the inclusion of a provision in the\u000a      convention that allows for the limited use of mercury in the artisanal\u000a      gold mining sector (Article 9 of the convention), as well as an\u000a      international funding mechanism to support capacity-building and\u000a      technology enhancement in developing countries (Article 15) (5.2, 5.4). It\u000a      is widely acknowledged by the United Nations that the treaty measures\u000a      adopted will reduce health threats for millions of people worldwide (5.2).\u000a    Regional policy strategies. Spiegel's research is also being used\u000a      by national governments to help implement the Minamata Convention, and to\u000a      inform governments about what needs to be included in national strategic\u000a      planning as part of Convention obligations (5.3, 5.4, 5.5). Building on\u000a      his longstanding relationships advising UNDP (United Nations Development\u000a      Programme) and UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), between 2011\u000a      and 2013 he has provided expert advice to the UNEP Global Mercury\u000a      Partnerships Advisory Committee which aims to protect human health and the\u000a      global environment from mercury. Most recently he discussed findings from\u000a      his research at a UNEP Mercury Policy Forum held in July 2013 in\u000a      Edinburgh. As part of this he advised governmental and international\u000a      policymakers, as well as NGOs from Africa, Asia and South America on\u000a      community-based approaches for implementing the requirements of the global\u000a      treaty. According to the Co-lead of the Artisanal and Small Scale Mining\u000a      Area of the UNEP Global Mercury Partnership `Spiegel's research has\u000a      influenced the thinking of governments and donors... providing compelling\u000a      arguments for devising new approaches that emphasize capacity-building and\u000a      empowerment for mining communities rather than punitive approaches' (5.4).\u000a    International policy. Away from mining, Spiegel's research has\u000a      also fed into discussions about the international trade in timber, where\u000a      lessons are being learned from the experience of mining regulation. The EU\u000a      is currently developing initiatives to prevent the import of illegally\u000a      harvested timber. The EU launched the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance\u000a      and Trade Action Plan in 2008 and contracted the Centre for International\u000a      Forestry Research to provide studies on the `formalization' of informal\u000a      resource sectors. In June 2012, Spiegel presented his research to European\u000a      Union policymakers in Brussels, drawing on his empirical fieldwork in\u000a      Indonesia and Zimbabwe, highlighting the importance of empowering local\u000a      institutions and marginalized rural groups during negotiations over\u000a      resource rights (5.7). The report is being used by the EU to inform\u000a      negotiations between the EU and other countries in an ongoing policy\u000a      process involving potential changes to the resource rights of millions of\u000a      forest-dependent people in (mostly tropical) countries that provide\u000a      natural resources to Europe (5.7).\u000a    National policy implementation. Spiegel's work has had impact on\u000a      policy and organizational capacity in Southern Africa. Zimbabwe is\u000a      currently recovering from a protracted economic crisis, with tens of\u000a      thousands of artisanal miners having been arrested during police\u000a      crackdowns between 2006 and 2009, affecting women, men and children in\u000a      artisanal mining communities. Spiegel's research helped to inform\u000a      processes of policy reform and recovery, giving direct advice to the\u000a      Ministry of Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development. According to\u000a      the Zimbabwean Secretary of Woman's Affairs, Gender and Development,\u000a      Spiegel's work has `help(ed) our ministry to implement the international\u000a      mercury treaty' (5.6). More specifically, Spiegel's work in this\u000a      area helped to shape the government's approach to the development of\u000a      community outreach services in rural artisanal gold mining areas,\u000a      particularly to support women, who are disproportionately affected by\u000a      mercury exposure (5.6).\u000a    Local organisation capacity. Spiegel's research has also helped\u000a      regional artisanal miners associations in Zimbabwe. With 1.5 million\u000a      people dependent on artisanal mining in Zimbabwe, improving equity in gold\u000a      mining is a major food security and environmental issue. The Zimbabwe\u000a      Artisanal and Small-Scale for Sustainable Mining Council (ZASMC) is the\u000a      first national association of its kind in Zimbabwe (officially launched in\u000a      2013) and Spiegel's advice helped to build ZASMC strategies for\u000a      representing marginalized constituents in the sector (5.8, 5.9). For\u000a      example, ZASMC invited Spiegel to speak at a national multi-stakeholder\u000a      forum on mining policy in Harare on February 14, 2013 (5.8). He presented\u000a      research findings in gold mining communities in the Insiza and\u000a      Kadoma-Chakari areas to senior government policy-makers, banks, artisanal\u000a      miners, multinational companies and NGOs, focusing on regional strategies\u000a      for improving environmental management and supporting livelihoods. His\u000a      research was also used by ZASMC in creating outreach strategies with\u000a      artisanal miners. Spiegel travelled with members of different regional\u000a      small-scale miners associations in the Insiza, Umzingwani, Kadoma and\u000a      Shamva regions to exchange knowledge on how grassroots organizational\u000a      strategies can be strengthened and to share experiences with national and\u000a      district government officers. The President of ZASMC has written that\u000a      Spiegel has `contributed quite immensely on the revival of small scale\u000a      miners in Zimbabwe' (5.9). As a result of ZASMC campaigns, the Government\u000a      of Zimbabwe announced plans in 2013 to decriminalize certain forms of\u000a      artisanal mining that were previously criminalized, high licensing fees\u000a      that created a formalisation barrier in marginalized mining communities\u000a      were lowered in 2013, and safer technologies were promoted (5.10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on the relationship between the livelihood strategies of\u000a      artisanal miners and the regulation of resource extraction has had impact\u000a      in three main areas:\u000a    \u000a      Informing international negotiations for the 2013 Minamata Convention\u000a        on Mercury, and in particular increasing the attention paid to artisanal\u000a        miners.\u000a      Assisting makers of national policy in implementing workable resource\u000a        regulations strategies in Africa and Asia, which take into account the\u000a        livelihood needs of artisanal miners, as part of attempts to implement\u000a        the Minamata Convention.\u000a      Assisting local organisations in Zimbabwe, in increasing their\u000a        capacity to campaign for forms of national regulation that take the\u000a        livelihood needs of artisanal miners into account.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    The University of Edinburgh\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Edinburgh (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Edinburgh","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007790}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"},{"GeoNamesId":"1105844","Name":"Harare Province"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aSpiegel S.J., 2012a.

The artisanal and small-scale mining sector\u000a      generally involves rudimentary methods of resource extraction. Through\u000a      multi-sited fieldwork that builds upon development studies, ecological\u000a      economics and political ecology, research carried out by Spiegel has\u000a      improved understandings of the relation between local livelihood concerns\u000a      in artisanal mining areas and evolving global mining policy paradigms.\u000a      Whilst working as a Lecturer in Edinburgh (since August 2011), Spiegel's\u000a      research has been supported by grants from the United Nations Environment\u000a      Programme (UNEP) (Analysis for Stakeholders on Formalization in the\u000a      Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Sector: Tanzania Case Study,\u000a      2011-12) and the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),\u000a      (Formalization of Informal Land and Resource Tenure: Reconceptualizing\u000a      Governance Priorities and Geographies of Inequality in Africa and Asia,\u000a      2011-213). Further field research was conducted in Zimbabwe with funds\u000a      from the School of Social and Political Science Strategic Research Support\u000a      Fund in December 2012 and February 2013.\u000a    Spiegel's research is practice-based and was carried out in participation\u000a      with rural stakeholders in artisanal gold mining areas, as well as\u000a      resource-extraction regulators, producing insights into the relationship\u000a      between the livelihood strategies of small scale and artisanal mines, and\u000a      attempts at environmental regulation (Spiegel 2012a, 2012b, 2012c,\u000a      2013).The research analysed the extent to which government-led\u000a      environmental initiatives and donor-funded interventions take into account\u000a      socioeconomic challenges at the grassroots level. The research was carried\u000a      out against the background of debates about regulating artisanal mining\u000a      and decentralisating environmental decision-making. Research investigated\u000a      different policy frameworks, governance dilemmas, and livelihood dynamics\u000a      in unlicensed mining contexts in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Mozambique, Brazil,\u000a      Indonesia and Cambodia. Drawing on interviews with mining communities,\u000a      lending institutions and policy-makers, the research has analysed the\u000a      structures and processes that are used to govern and support small-scale\u000a      artisanal mining.\u000a    One of the principal findings of the research has been that addressing\u000a      livelihood insecurity in the small-scale mining sector should be\u000a      prioritized in resource policy reform initiatives, particularly given\u000a      rising global trends towards rural economic dependence on rudimentary\u000a      resource extraction (Spiegel 2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2013). The comparative\u000a      analysis shows that most mineral policy frameworks have significant\u000a      weaknesses due to the lack of formal legal recognition given to\u000a      marginalized miners. Furthermore, tightening environmental regulations,\u000a      without addressing the needs of artisanal and small scale mining groups,\u000a      will criminalizw activities and processes that impoverished communities\u000a      need for their subsistence. The research therefore proposes alternative\u000a      global and regional environmental regulation strategies that aim to\u000a      encourage institutional adaptation to contextual nuances, and in\u000a      particular, engagement with excluded groups (Spiegel 2012a, 2012b, 2012c,\u000a      2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28122","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context: Researchers and policy makers have traditionally viewed\u000d\u000a      direct transfers in cash as a\u000d\u000a      tool that worked best in addressing short term poverty, smoothing out the\u000d\u000a      impact of hazards on\u000d\u000a      household consumption (e.g. World Bank's Social Risk Management Strategy).\u000d\u000a      This research\u000d\u000a      demonstrates that transfer programmes reaching people in extreme and\u000d\u000a      chronic poverty can also\u000d\u000a      be effective, through raising their consumption and strengthening their\u000d\u000a      productive capacity.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to Impact: The research has engaged governments, the\u000d\u000a      development community and\u000d\u000a      academia at a national and international level. In addition to\u000d\u000a      publications in leading journals,\u000d\u000a      outputs have been disseminated through international conferences, the\u000d\u000a      production of accessible\u000d\u000a      resources for practitioners and the general public, and through direct\u000d\u000a      advisory work.\u000d\u000a    1.

(Manchester, 2010).\u000d\u000a    2. The research has produced two key sources on antipoverty\u000d\u000a        transfers facilitating outreach to\u000d\u000a      non-academic audiences. Firstly, the research was published in an\u000d\u000a      accessible format within the\u000d\u000a      book Just Give Money to the Poor: the Development Revolution from the\u000d\u000a        Global South which\u000d\u000a      has figured prominently in international and national policy dialogue on\u000d\u000a      antipoverty transfers,\u000d\u000a      and featured in the Guardian's shortlist of key development studies texts\u000d\u000a      for first-year students\u000d\u000a      [1]. Secondly, the `Social Assistance in Developing Countries Database'\u000d\u000a      has become a widely\u000d\u000a      used and cited evidence source on antipoverty transfer programmes for both\u000d\u000a      researchers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners, and builds on the work of the CPRC in encouraging more\u000d\u000a      countries and agencies\u000d\u000a      to disaggregate data in their poverty analyses, further recognising the\u000d\u000a      chronically poor and\u000d\u000a      persistently vulnerable [2].\u000d\u000a    3. The research has been influential through advisory work on\u000d\u000a        antipoverty transfers. The\u000d\u000a      researchers have contributed directly to national government policy &#8212; for\u000d\u000a      instance leading a\u000d\u000a      feasibility study for the Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment\u000d\u000a      Programme (SAGE) pilot\u000d\u000a      phase in Uganda &#8212; and have provided advice to the Governments of Pakistan,\u000d\u000a      Kyrgyzstan,\u000d\u000a      Chile, Mozambique, Zambia, Bangladesh and Uganda, amongst others. Advice\u000d\u000a      is also\u000d\u000a      regularly given to multilateral and bilateral agencies (e.g. DFID, World\u000d\u000a      Bank, UNICEF, ILO,\u000d\u000a      FAO, ISSA, WHO, UNDESA, EU, and the Caribbean Development Bank) with UoM\u000d\u000a      researchers providing capacity building to officials from UNICEF, DFID,\u000d\u000a      ILO, FAO, WFP, and\u000d\u000a      GTZ.\u000d\u000a    Key Impacts: The impact of this research has been twofold.\u000d\u000a      Firstly, in raising awareness and\u000d\u000a      understanding of the essential role of direct antipoverty transfers in\u000d\u000a      reducing global poverty among\u000d\u000a      policy makers and the general public. Secondly, via the development of a\u000d\u000a      knowledge base to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate that direct antipoverty transfers are financially and\u000d\u000a      politically sustainable in low to\u000d\u000a      middle income countries. The research has shaped policy debates in\u000d\u000a        three arenas:\u000d\u000a    [I] Shaping UK policy thinking and practice on antipoverty transfers:\u000d\u000a      In June 2010, the book\u000d\u000a      Just Give Money to the Poor &#8212; conceived by the authors as a tome\u000d\u000a      `that a Minister could read on a\u000d\u000a      4 hour flight' &#8212; was instrumental in persuading the incoming government to\u000d\u000a      commit to expanding\u000d\u000a      their support for antipoverty transfer programmes in sub-Saharan Africa\u000d\u000a      and south Asia. At the\u000d\u000a      request of DFID's Director of Policy, advanced copies were circulated\u000d\u000a      within DFID. This followed a\u000d\u000a      Guardian article by Aditya Chakrabortty on the role of antipoverty\u000d\u000a      transfers based on UoM\u000d\u000a      research \"...the world of aid turned upside down\" [3] and a\u000d\u000a      follow-up letter to the Guardian from the\u000d\u000a      Secretary of State for International Development (Andrew Mitchell MP), who\u000d\u000a      affirmed that the new\u000d\u000a      government \"will explore using cash transfers more often\" in UK\u000d\u000a      efforts to eliminate poverty, further\u000d\u000a      outlining that: \"The new government is determined to give people in\u000d\u000a        developing countries more\u000d\u000a        power over their own lives. I've seen for myself in Ethiopia just how\u000d\u000a        effective this approach can be.\u000d\u000a        Thanks to rigorous evaluations, we know that giving very small sums of\u000d\u000a        money can enable poor\u000d\u000a        people to invest in small businesses, increase their productivity and\u000d\u000a        send their children to school.\u000d\u000a        That's why my department will explore using cash transfers more often,\u000d\u000a        where appropriate.\u000d\u000a        Methods like this will go alongside our work to build capable and\u000d\u000a        effective states\" [3].\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, the key message of the book, on the role of direct\u000d\u000a      antipoverty transfers in\u000d\u000a      addressing extreme and chronic poverty, received extended media coverage.\u000d\u000a      It was the `Idea of\u000d\u000a      the Day' in the New York Times, and was covered by the Boston Globe and\u000d\u000a      the Economist,\u000d\u000a      amongst other publications [1]. The research was also picked up by a\u000d\u000a      number of radio outlets,\u000d\u000a      including an interview with Barrientos on the BBC World Service radio\u000d\u000a      programme Newshour, in a\u000d\u000a      slot entitled `Affording Old Age' (a special edition for `Pensions Day').\u000d\u000a    [II] Shaping international policy and practice on antipoverty\u000d\u000a        transfers: The research has been\u000d\u000a      influential in informing policy and policy priorities among several UN\u000d\u000a      Agencies, bilateral and\u000d\u000a      INGOs, including: on the politics of social protection; on the need to\u000d\u000a      promote more sustainable and\u000d\u000a      institutionalised forms of assistance in developing countries; and on\u000d\u000a      social assistance for the\u000d\u000a      elderly. Impact has been threefold. Firstly, through collaboration\u000d\u000a          and citation. As the Director of\u000d\u000a      Strategic Development for HelpAge International confirms: \"CPRC's work\u000d\u000a        helped to inform\u000d\u000a        HelpAge International, in our work on the adoption of cash transfer\u000d\u000a        programmes, specifically in our\u000d\u000a        case universal basic pensions, by developing country governments as a\u000d\u000a        means to address chronic\u000d\u000a        and extreme poverty\". This included the co-authorship of a HelpAge\u000d\u000a      briefing document `Pensions,\u000d\u000a      poverty and wellbeing' [4]. Other examples include Barrientos providing an\u000d\u000a      `overview synthesis' for\u000d\u000a      the 2010 ILO report `Extending Social Security to All';\u000d\u000a      collaboration with UNRISD for the flagship\u000d\u000a      report `Combating Poverty and Inequality' (2009-2010), providing a\u000d\u000a      thematic paper `Social\u000d\u000a      Protection and Poverty'; citation (alongside Hickey and Hulme) in the 2010\u000d\u000a      European Communities\u000d\u000a        Development Report `Social Protection for Inclusive Development';\u000d\u000a      and the provision of a short\u000d\u000a      piece for the 2010 IPC-IG (UNDP) publication `Can Social\u000d\u000a      Protection Help Promote Inclusive\u000d\u000a      Growth?' [5]. Secondly, research has been employed through direct\u000d\u000a        consultation, including\u000d\u000a      Barrientos' background paper for the UN High Level Panel Report on the\u000d\u000a      post 2015 development\u000d\u000a      agenda [6]. Thirdly, the work has been discussed via contributions to high-level\u000d\u000a        conferences, such\u000d\u000a      as the UN Commission for Social Development's 50th Session [7].\u000d\u000a    [III] Shaping national government policy and practice on antipoverty\u000d\u000a        transfers: The\u000d\u000a      researchers have engaged with several national governments based on the\u000d\u000a      cited research. In\u000d\u000a      Uganda the Minister of Finance, in his closing speech to the 2008\u000d\u000a      CPRC International Conference\u000d\u000a      `Social Protection for the Poorest in Africa: Learning from Experience',\u000d\u000a      announced the\u000d\u000a      implementation of a pilot antipoverty transfer programmes (SAGE program)\u000d\u000a      and acknowledged the\u000d\u000a      role of UoM research. Consequently, a country-level `Social Protection\u000d\u000a      Working Group' was formed\u000d\u000a      to support this initiative, and facilitate public and political dialogue\u000d\u000a      on social protection. As noted by\u000d\u000a      a former DFID Senior Officer (now UNICEF): \"[the] conference held in\u000d\u000a        2008 played a key role in\u000d\u000a        exposing Government and civil society to international evidence of the\u000d\u000a        success and\u000d\u000a        implementation of cash transfer programmes. This led to the adoption by\u000d\u000a        the Government of\u000d\u000a        Uganda of a cash transfer programme targeting 14 districts and a target\u000d\u000a        group of over 600,000\u000d\u000a        people with a focus on groups identified as chronically poor, from 2010\u000d\u000a        onwards\" [8]. The largest\u000d\u000a      social assistance programme in the country was also revised in its second\u000d\u000a      phase to include a\u000d\u000a      stronger role for local government as a result of CPRC research, with the\u000d\u000a      phrase `chronically poor'\u000d\u000a      now seen a part of the political lexicon.\u000d\u000a    In Bangladesh the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has\u000d\u000a      enlisted BWPI to support\u000d\u000a      the Government of Bangladesh in reforming and reorganizing the existing\u000d\u000a      social protection system.\u000d\u000a      As the UNDP Resident Representative confirms: \"The contribution of the\u000d\u000a        Manchester team has\u000d\u000a        been one of the most significant. I would specifically\u000d\u000a        highlight: First... local and global research on\u000d\u000a        the role and effectiveness of social protection... has informed and\u000d\u000a        spurred Government interest,\u000d\u000a        and helped to foster a consensus among civil society actors for the need\u000d\u000a        for change.

In\u000d\u000a      2009 Cadbury converted\u000d\u000a      its main chocolate lines to certified Fairtrade, including Dairy Milk and\u000d\u000a      Green &amp; Blacks in 2011\u000d\u000a      [6][7], with Kraft \"now the world's largest buyer of Fairtrade\u000d\u000a        Certified cocoa and Fairtrade Organic\u000d\u000a        cocoa\", buying over 20,000 tonnes of Fairtrade cocoa from Ghana\u000d\u000a      alone, as well as expanding\u000d\u000a      Fairtrade cocoa sales from Cote d'Ivoire [1]. Moreover, Cadbury\u000d\u000a      now pays over &#163;3 million per\u000d\u000a        annum in social premiums to Kuapa Kokoo &#8212; a Fairtrade\u000d\u000a      certified Cooperative with a membership\u000d\u000a      of 50,000 small-scale farmers in Ghana [1] with Cadbury\/Kraft Fairtrade\u000d\u000a      chocolate products now\u000d\u000a      sold to worldwide market (including the UK, Ireland, Australia, New\u000d\u000a      Zealand, Canada and South\u000d\u000a      Africa) [1][7].\u000d\u000a    Research Impact via Kraft\/ Mondel&#275;z: Following Kraft's 2010\u000d\u000a      takeover of Cadbury, the\u000d\u000a      incorporated company organised a workshop in London attended by Kraft\u000d\u000a      Foods at which UoM\u000d\u000a      and its country researcher partners presented findings and recommendations\u000d\u000a      from the three\u000d\u000a      studies. This helped to persuade Kraft of the importance of the research\u000d\u000a      findings, the uniqueness\u000d\u000a      of the approach, and the significant contribution of the CCP [6]. It was\u000d\u000a      attended by 45 invited\u000d\u000a      participants including senior representatives from Kraft in the USA,\u000d\u000a      Cadbury, CCP, government\u000d\u000a      and NGO stakeholders. As Cadbury's Director of Agriculture and\u000d\u000a      Conformance, at the time, later\u000d\u000a      confirmed: \"The event was successful in that it had the effect of\u000d\u000a        helping to persuade Kraft to\u000d\u000a        continue supporting CCP, as well as seeking to embed `good practice\u000d\u000a        throughout its supply chain\"\u000d\u000a      [6]; and as Kraft\/Mondel&#275;z noted some time after the event: \"[the]\u000d\u000a      Cadbury Cocoa Partnership\u000d\u000a        commitment has been maintained by Kraft and forms [the] basis for\u000d\u000a        new cocoa strategy within\u000d\u000a        Kraft.

Based\u000d\u000a      upon ongoing research\u000d\u000a      evidence, generated by Barrientos and colleagues, the CCP continued to be\u000d\u000a      supported, and in\u000d\u000a      2012 Mondel&#275;z launched the `Cocoa Life' programme, a US$400\u000d\u000a      million initiative that builds\u000d\u000a      directly on the CCP, and aims to extend support to over 200,000 cocoa\u000d\u000a      farmers and 1 million\u000d\u000a      people in their communities internationally over the period 2012-2022 [8].\u000d\u000a      It was recognised by\u000d\u000a      Mondel&#275;z that \"the reports on the Dominican Republic and India\u000d\u000a        have added to the initial 2008\u000d\u000a        work in Ghanaian cocoa production...

We\u000d\u000a        look forward to continuing to work with Professor Barrientos, on our\u000d\u000a        Cocoa Life journey\" [9].\u000d\u000a    Impact 5: Spill-over Impacts for Fairtrade Chocolate: The impact\u000d\u000a      of UoM research has been felt\u000d\u000a      across the industry as a whole, demonstrating its broad applicability.\u000d\u000a      Nestl&#233; and Mars have\u000d\u000a      launched cocoa programmes similar to CCP, and have converted parts of\u000d\u000a      their product ranges to\u000d\u000a      Fairtrade (including KitKat in 2010, and Maltesers in 2011) [7]. This\u000d\u000a      replication was recognised by\u000d\u000a      Kraft who noted that: \"Following [the] Cadbury Fairtrade\u000d\u000a        commitment, Mars and Nestle made\u000d\u000a        commitments to Fairtrade and other certification,\" and more\u000d\u000a      specifically: \"Cadbury Cocoa\u000d\u000a        Partnership was the first major chocolate company commitment to\u000d\u000a        long-term investment in\u000d\u000a        sustainability. Mars, Nestle and other companies have since upped their\u000d\u000a        focus on sustainability\u000d\u000a        and their public commitments\" [1]. Jointly, Cadbury\/Kraft, Nestl&#233;\u000d\u000a      and Mars have contributed to a\u000d\u000a      more than 8-fold increase in Fairtrade cocoa products sold in the UK, from\u000d\u000a      &#163;25.6 million in 2008 to\u000d\u000a      &#163;320.9 million in 2012. In addition, UK sales of Fairtrade chocolate rose\u000d\u000a      from 1% of total chocolate\u000d\u000a      sales in 2008 to 12% in 2012 [7][10]. Moreover, the Fairtrade Foundation\u000d\u000a      recognise:\u000d\u000a    \"The decision by Cadbury to work with the Fairtrade movement, we\u000d\u000a        believe has created a\u000d\u000a        wider catalytic effect in a number of ways... It enabled Fairtrade to\u000d\u000a        start to reach a wider\u000d\u000a        consumer base, beyond the `ethical shopper'... It sent a signal to the\u000d\u000a        chocolate industry\u000d\u000a        that Fairtrade could indeed work at scale... and demonstrated Fairtrade\u000d\u000a        as a credible\u000d\u000a        partner to major multinational brands on sustainability initiatives with\u000d\u000a        a reach of tens of\u000d\u000a        thousands of farmers.... For Kuapa Kokoo, it has enabled them to\u000d\u000a        reposition themselves\u000d\u000a        within the Ghanaian cocoa industry as a major player in cocoa production\u000d\u000a        and export, no\u000d\u000a        longer a niche\/alternative supply chain partner. It has provided them\u000d\u000a        with a significant\u000d\u000a        revenue stream that enables them, for example, to become a partner in\u000d\u000a        the Government's\u000d\u000a        Swollen Shoots cocoa agronomy programme.\" [7]\u000d\u000a    Barrientos and Mondelez are currently planning future research\u000d\u000a      around gender and cocoa\u000d\u000a      production. [9]. This has implications for the wider research field, Kraft\u000d\u000a      recognising that: \"the\u000d\u000a        research has fundamentally shifted the way development experts see the\u000d\u000a        development agenda,\u000d\u000a        specifically in Ghana but arguably now beyond in terms of working with\u000d\u000a        smallholder famers and\u000d\u000a        engaging with those most marginalized and not likely to be in any framer\u000d\u000a        organization\" [6].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Fieldwork commissioned by Cadbury\/Kraft, undertaken at the University of\u000d\u000a      Manchester (UoM), and\u000d\u000a      carried out in Ghana, the Dominican Republic and India (2006-11),\u000d\u000a      considers whether small scale\u000d\u000a      farmers and workers have the social and economic capacity to sustain and\u000d\u000a      expand their output of\u000d\u000a      quality cocoa.

Case studies\u000d\u000a      were undertaken based on key informant (KI) interviews, surveys and focus\u000d\u000a      group discussions in\u000d\u000a      each country. In total approximately 100 KIs, 750 farmers, 200 workers as\u000d\u000a      well as youth and\u000d\u000a      community stakeholders were interviewed. The research identified key\u000d\u000a      challenges facing cocoa\u000d\u000a      farming, providing recommendations to Cadbury on support for cocoa\u000d\u000a      farmers, youth and\u000d\u000a      communities to enhance their future socio-economic capacity. It\u000d\u000a      highlighted incomes often below\u000d\u000a      the poverty line, low productivity levels, gender inequities and poor\u000d\u000a      social provision for cocoa\u000d\u000a      farmers and workers, with youth exiting the cocoa sector putting future\u000d\u000a      production at risk. The main\u000d\u000a      findings have been made public, with the data used in academic\u000d\u000a      publications [A][B][C]. Separate\u000d\u000a      confidential reports were given to Cadbury containing commercially\u000d\u000a      sensitive value chain\u000d\u000a      information, helping to inform their decision to adopt Fairtrade\u000d\u000a      certification. The originality of the\u000d\u000a      research was threefold:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aThis was the first time that a chocolate company had provided\u000d\u000a          researchers full access to their\u000d\u000a          commercial value chain in order to assess the linkages between\u000d\u000a        their commercial operations\u000d\u000a        and the socio-economic basis of their cocoa sourcing. The research was\u000d\u000a        thus able to provide\u000d\u000a        unique insights into both the commercial-social linkages, and\u000d\u000a        socio-economic challenges of\u000d\u000a        cocoa sourcing. [C][E]\u000d\u000a      The research carried out in three countries facilitated comparison\u000d\u000a          across diverse locations of\u000d\u000a        underlying issues, including the role of gender in cocoa production. [A]\u000d\u000a      Both the research process itself, and engagement with Cadbury, illuminated\u000d\u000a          the drivers behind\u000d\u000a          the rise of corporate initiatives to address socio-economic upgrading\u000d\u000a          within cocoa-chocolate\u000d\u000a          value chains. [B]\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Research was undertaken in collaboration with in-country research\u000d\u000a      partners with detailed local\u000d\u000a      knowledge. Key partners were: the Department of Economics, University of\u000d\u000a      Ghana; an\u000d\u000a      independent cocoa researcher in the Dominican Republic; and the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Management in\u000d\u000a      Agriculture, Indian Institute of Management (Ahmedabad). UoM set three\u000d\u000a      conditions in undertaking\u000d\u000a      the research: complete independence; the retention of intellectual\u000d\u000a      property rights; and the right to\u000d\u000a      publish with normal research protocols and disclaimers.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28124","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2403846","Name":"Sierra Leone"},{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Background: In 2009, Jacoby was invited to IWMN to give a talk to\u000a      large group of educators and museum professionals, all involved in\u000a      developing curricula in the area of conflict studies. His presentation &#8212;\u000a      `The Problem with Peace' &#8212; problematised `how to' questions of conflict\u000a      resolution, which had traditionally presumed that lowering the intensity\u000a      of violence would serve as an end in itself. The feedback was excellent,\u000a      and Jacoby was asked to co-curate the two audio-visual displays that would\u000a      make up the core of the BTT initiative [1]. By drawing on his research\u000a      findings, and working collaboratively with both museum staff and\u000a      professional film makers, he guided BTT &#8212; launched on the `International\u000a      Day of Peace' (21st September 2011) as part of the London\u000a      Games' `Olympic Truce' programme &#8212; towards a greater emphasis upon the\u000a      ethical and political challenges of disarmament, demobilisation,\u000a      re-integration and peace-building.\u000a    Pathways to Impact: Working with the HCRI, ten key individuals\u000a      with experience of living and working in conflict-affected countries were\u000a      interviewed at length. These included former prisoners such as Seanna\u000a      Walsh (IRA) and Jackie McDonald (UDA), both now involved in Northern Irish\u000a      peace initiatives; former UoM MA student Courtny Edwards, who had worked\u000a      for a health NGO in a displaced persons' camps during the Sierra Leonean\u000a      civil war; and Professor Tony Redmond (HCRI co-founder), who led aid teams\u000a      in Kosovo following NATO attacks in 1999 [1]. Alongside IWMN, Jacoby\u000a      selected and awarded a &#163;55,000 contract to a specialist production company\u000a      (The Soup Collective) to develop audio-visual display material to\u000a      accompany the interviews; their director commenting that Jacoby's \"expertise\u000a        and judgement were essential to the direction of the final films... Both\u000a        our company and the Museum benefitted greatly from this collaboration\u000a        and established a co-production model that was an improvement on the\u000a        past and an example for the future\" [2]. Throughout, Jacoby\u000a      maintained responsibility for academic content and developing learning\u000a      objectives, and was lead press contact for media enquiries throughout the\u000a      IWML run.\u000a    The Exhibitions: With more than 1.3 million visitors a year across\u000a      its two main sites (London and Manchester), the IWM is well placed to\u000a      extend academic research to a broader audience. The BTT project is one of\u000a      the largest and most prestigious ever undertaken at the IWM, and was\u000a      unusual as it ran in both London and Manchester venues, \"recognising\u000a        the very different environments and identities of the two sites\", as\u000a      well as initiating supplementary events at other IWM locations [1]. It was\u000a      funded from the organisation as a whole, with matched funding secured from\u000a      the DCMS. The overall budget (for the period 2009-13) was around &#163;500,000\u000a      [1]. Accompanying the exhibition were a series of four continuing\u000a      professional development (CPD) events (October 2010 - September 2012)\u000a      reviewing and discussing the issues that BTT raises.\u000a    IWML: The BTT interactive multimedia display was exhibited at the\u000a      IWML in the prestigious B11 gallery (May 24th until September\u000a      23rd 2012) and \"the touchscreen installation is now a\u000a        permanent feature of the museum's research\/resource area on the ground\u000a        floor\" [1]. In including this project in the Olympic Truce\u000a      Programme, and awarding it the Inspire kitemark, Lord Coe (Chair of\u000a      LOGOC), noted that \"projects like Build the Truce use the power of the\u000a        Games to inspire change.\" [4]. During the May launch of the IWML\u000a      exhibition the Head of Conflict Department at the Foreign and Commonwealth\u000a      Office, and author of the Government's `Building Stability Overseas\u000a      Strategy' stated that BTT \"gave the public exactly the right message\u000a        regarding the complexities of post-conflict situations\" [1]; later\u000a      noting that he: \"felt the project was successful in capturing the\u000a        complexity of peace as not as simply the absence of war... It also\u000a        underlined the need for international interventions to fully consider\u000a        the needs of local people... It certainly succeeded in raising awareness\u000a        of the difficulties encountered during periods of truce and gave the\u000a        public exactly the right message regarding the complexities of post\u000a        conflict situations\" He also affirmed that BTT \"made a useful\u000a        contribution to HMG's broader work on the Olympic Truce in 2012\",\u000a      with the project also featuring prominently on the FCO's `Olympic Truce'\u000a      web-feed [5]. Visitor numbers during the Olympic period were estimated to\u000a      be around 250,000, with around 30% (75,000) visiting B11. The exhibition\u000a      was covered by the national press, with an article in the Daily Mirror\u000a      noting that: \"With images from Iraq, El Salvador, Sierra Leone, Kosovo\u000a        Northern Ireland and others, [BTT] uses touch-screens to explain\u000a        how a truce can have far-reaching effects. The soundtrack, made up of\u000a        eyewitness interviews, offers a compelling insight from a huge variety\u000a        of people from soldiers to medics and civilians\" [6].\u000a    Supporting events were held, including a discussion session facilitated\u000a      by the London Boroughs Faith Network in June 2012, involving both Conrad\u000a      Bailey and Lord Michael Bates, who undertook a 3000 mile `Walk for Truce',\u000a      from Olympia to London, and an array of British Council backed classroom\u000a      activities for 11-16 year olds [7]. Lastly, as part of IWML's 2012\u000a      `International Day of Peace' programme (22nd September 2012),\u000a      Jacoby chaired a BTT workshop entitled `Starting in Neutral: What does\u000a      Neutrality Mean or Matter in 21st Century Humanitarian Conflict Response?'\u000a      This public event, reviewing BTT as a whole and considering `lessons\u000a      learnt', was held in IWML's largest auditorium, and included contributions\u000a      from: the Executive Director of Conciliation Resources who commended BTT\u000a      as \"an effective way of reaching out to members of the British public - particularly those outside the peacebuilders' specialist-loop...\u000a        introduce[ing] some complexity into the discussion\" [8]; the\u000a      Director of Programmes at International Alert; the Head of the M&#233;decins\u000a        Sans Fronti&#232;res Programmes Unit; and the UK spokesperson from the\u000a      International Committee of the Red Cross, who welcomed further\u000a      collaboration with Jacoby and remarked that he was \"impressed by how\u000a        `Build the Truce' problematised conflict resolution, particularly via\u000a        the innovative use of audio-visual displays... The project was clearly\u000a        effective, particularly in the manner through which research findings\u000a        were crafted to reach audiences who would not necessarily have fully\u000a        considered these issues beforehand... [BTT &amp; BPS] offer a\u000a        useful model for the presentation and discussion of difficult themes,\u000a        presenting... public engagement, through the formation of relationships\u000a        between public institutions, NGOs and academic institutions\" [9].\u000a    IWMN: The BPS is a major selling point for IWMN, shown hourly in\u000a      the main exhibition space designed by renowned architect Daniel Libeskind,\u000a      presenting \"the personal stories of those caught up in conflict,\u000a        narrating the experiences of ordinary people in extraordinary\u000a        situations.\" As the IWMN's Director continues \"`...Build the\u000a        Truce' is a significant and exciting addition to our repertoire. The\u000a        partnership project has been a great success, fitting well with the\u000a        purpose and strategies ambitions of IWMN to look at how war and conflict\u000a        shapes lives\" [3]. BTT has provided `unique pieces' enriching the\u000a      IWM archives, and it is estimated that a majority of visitors will view at\u000a      least one example of the BPS during their visit (69% of visitors saw a BPS\u000a      in 2010). Footfall estimates predict that around 40,000 people visited\u000a      IWMN during the initial exhibition period (July &#8212; October 2012), where the\u000a      film was supplemented with two workstations in the `Your History' area on\u000a      the ground floor, with touchscreens showing interview clips, alongside\u000a      arranged tours [3].\u000a    The numbers of visitors seeing the film remains considerable. Since 15th\u000a      July 2012, it has been granted a prime slot (initially 2pm daily; now\u000a      weekends and bank holidays) in the BPS permanent programme (n.b.\u000a      annual visits to IWMN are in excess of 350,000)[3]. To supplement the BPS,\u000a      Jacoby worked with Radiowaves, a market leader in educational social\u000a      media; through the network generated, he and museum staff have distributed\u000a      a range of resources drawn from the core research to schools and colleges\u000a      throughout the country, including supplementary video materials &#8212; with\u000a      requests for copies made by museums in Canada and schools in Italy &#8212; and\u000a      bookable school sessions [1]. The Radiowaves collaboration has involved a\u000a      number of focus groups, the recruiting of further delegates (mainly\u000a      schoolteachers) to IWMN events and additional (broadcast) interviews with\u000a      academics, peace activists and journalists. Selected weekends have also\u000a      been used by IWMN staff to facilitate activities for young children based\u000a      around the idea of \"call[ing] a truce, whatever your\u000a        differences\". Young visitors to the museum were invited to watch the\u000a      BPS, and then hear `a slimy story of slugs, snails and truce time\u000a        tales' finding out `what united the slugs and snails in this\u000a        funny and inspiring tale of truce', and subsequently making a unique\u000a      artwork based on their view of the stories presented. IWMN noted that\u000a      event feedback was positive, confirming also that: \"Project\u000a        activities... were developed, piloted, delivered, evaluated and absorbed\u000a        into permanent programmes\" over the four years of the programme\u000a      [1][3]. In 2014 BTT will also make up a key part the `Aftermaths of War'\u000a      programme at the John Rylands Library, Deansgate.\u000a    Evaluation &amp; Legacy: Jacoby was able to secure UoM funding in\u000a      order to thoroughly evaluate the impact of the displays, as well as gauge\u000a      visitor perceptions more generally. Interviews were conducted with 263\u000a      individuals at both sites, and it was revealed that 73% of those\u000a      interviewed had watched the whole film, with 64% per cent of viewers\u000a      reporting that the film had changed their perception of truces, and 65%\u000a      stating that the issue was more complicated than they had previously\u000a      imagined. Selected comments included: \"Truce isn't always peace\"; I\u000a        didn't realise how hard things are after war\"; and \"Before, I\u000a        thought [truce] was always effective and well sorted out &#8212; but\u000a        after watching the film, I've changed my mind\". Most importantly,\u000a      the evaluation revealed that 56% of interviewees thought that the BTT had\u000a      changed their view of the IWM itself, noting that for visitors \"the\u000a        BTT display added another dimension to their experience and feelings of\u000a        the Imperial War Museum\". The most common reason cited was that the\u000a      exhibition moved away from a focus on the execution of war, towards a more\u000a      subtle consideration of the less obvious aspects associated with the\u000a      aftermath of conflict. The report concluded that \"there was the general\u000a        feeling that the museum was moving forward and `continues to grow and\u000a        evolve'\", and this observation was attributed not only to the BPS,\u000a      but also the interactive and visual components of the IWML exhibition,\u000a      with 85% stating that the presence of eyewitness experience within the\u000a      film was `important' or `very important' in shaping their overall\u000a      perception of the display. Finally, the success of the exhibitions has\u000a      been recognised by IWM staff, with the evaluation itself showing that half\u000a      of respondents saw BTT as positively affecting their view of the IWM as a\u000a      whole. It was also notable that the touch-screens were not seen as\u000a      central to the exhibition; 78% of viewers did not use them, yet 73% of\u000a        those interviewed watched the whole of the film\u000a      [10, passim].\u000a    It has been recognised that \"installing temporary exhibitions at both\u000a        IWM's main exhibition venues was a unique decision reflecting the\u000a        project's value and importance to IWM's developing brand identity and\u000a        mission statement.\" As a result of these successful engagements, the\u000a      IWMN director invited Jacoby to join the IWMN `Academic Network' to advise\u000a      the museum on forthcoming events and medium to long term overall strategy\u000a      [1]. Jacoby also presented details of the project to the international\u000a      conference: `Challenging Memories: Silence and Empathy in Heritage\u000a      Interpretation' (7th - 10th July 2013); the aim of which is to further\u000a      solidify the bonds between academia and museum curation, with BTT seen as\u000a      an exemplar of this mode of engagement [1][3].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Build the Truce (BTT) project, undertaken at the University\u000a      of Manchester (UoM), considers the challenges involved in establishing and\u000a      maintaining a truce during times of conflict. Findings from the research\u000a      provided the basis for two innovative exhibitions, co-funded by the\u000a      Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS). First, an interactive\u000a      multimedia display at the Imperial War Museum London (IWML), included as\u000a      an official part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad. Second, a Big Picture\u000a        Show (BPS); part of the rolling programme at the Imperial War Museum\u000a      North (IWMN). Together these exhibitions, associated public engagement\u000a      activities and workshops, have both challenged and altered public\u000a      perceptions of truce, as well as offering a valuable example of how\u000a      complex and controversial topics can be presented within a museum setting.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    The University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2643123","Name":"Manchester"},{"GeoNamesId":"2643743","Name":"London"}],"References":"\u000a\u0009(all references available upon request - AUR)\u000a    The research is framed around two monographs, and a number of peer\u000a      reviewed journal articles.\u000a    \u000a[A] (2013) Jacoby, T. &amp; &#214;zerdem, A.

Instead, truce could constitute a period of\u000a      unpredictable challenges, where deep-rooted sources of conflict may\u000a      re-emerge, at the same time as issues around disarmament, demobilisation\u000a      and peace-building come to the fore. This built on research undertaken\u000a      over the last ten years in Turkey, where there have been intermittent\u000a      truces between Kurdish insurgents and the state for much of the republic's\u000a      history - including a broadly observed ceasefire between 1999 and 2005.\u000a      This led to journal articles, alongside a major monograph that addressed\u000a      human security and conflict transformation [A]. Similarly, research was\u000a      undertaken with reference to similar periods of truce in Bosnia (funded by\u000a      the International Labour Organisation) and in Palestine, as well as a\u000a      consideration of the geo-political implications of organising an\u000a      international intervention following a truce. Taken together, the theme of\u000a      `truce breakdown' also informed an influential monograph that considered\u000a      the causes of violent conflict more broadly [D].\u000a    These outputs informed the editorship of two special editions of highly\u000a      prestigious journals, where the issue of rebuilding conflict-affected\u000a      contexts during periods of truce was addressed, aiming at a wide-ranging\u000a      engagement with both practitioners and the broader academic community\u000a      [B][C]. These outputs were supported by an ESRC funded seminar series held\u000a      at the Humanitarianism and Conflict Response Institute (HCRI). The HCRI\u000a      was co-founded by Jacoby in 2009 with the specific purpose of researching\u000a      conflict and post-conflict situations, and has now expanded to nine\u000a      salaried academic members of staff, five administrators, five degree\u000a      programmes, and over 20 PhD students. Taken together, Jacoby's research\u000a      has led to the following conclusions:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aPeace is not as simple as the absence of war. Ending violence\u000a        or reducing its intensity tends not to provide a sustainable basis for\u000a        long-term conflict transformation. It is unlikely to bring justice and\u000a        human security unless the causes of the conflict are understood and\u000a        addressed fully [D]. Without this process of reflection,\u000a        conflict-affected countries tend to remain locked into a fluctuating\u000a        cycle of violence [A].\u000a      \u000aInternational efforts to build truces are often founded upon donor\u000a          requirements and\/or foreign policy imperatives, rather than local need.\u000a        Opportunities to guide post-conflict societies in new directions are\u000a        frequently determined not by the preferences of one or more of the\u000a        protagonists, but by the victors, established elites or international\u000a        actors [E].\u000a      \u000aThe process of demobilisation and disarmament is not as simple as\u000a          merely turning swords in ploughshares. The presence of\u000a        international agencies and former combatants re-entering society can\u000a        bring new challenges to housing provisions and the labour market.\u000a        Overlying these issues is the question of legitimacy. In many situations\u000a        of truce, it is not clear why some (typically the state or a third party\u000a        intervener) are permitted to maintain arms despite possessing little\u000a        moral or administrative authority over that society [C]. As a\u000a        consequence, rehabilitation is stalled, violent crime may increase and\u000a        there may be a resumption of war itself [A][D].\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28125","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pathways to Impact: Prior to the first conference in 1991, there\u000a      had been little research on the role and work of NGOs in development. The\u000a      only significant international event had been organised in 1987 by the\u000a      Overseas Development Institute, a non-profit think tank, and primarily\u000a      involved development assistance agencies. The IDPM initiative, led by\u000a      Professor David Hulme alongside Michael Edwards from Save the Children\u000a      Fund, catalysed knowledge and scholarship and involved many more NGOs and\u000a      researchers. Further conferences broadened the scope to the wider domain\u000a      of civil society, leading to multiple impacts on non-academic users, and\u000a      recognition by development agencies and the NGO sector itself\u000a      (collectively and within individual organizations), alongside other groups\u000a      and individuals. The primary pathways for this impact have been:\u000a      participation in events and debates, longstanding relationships between\u000a      UoM researchers and civil society organizations and written documentation.\u000a      Key impacts, which encompass a noted effect on organisational\u000a      performance, can be grouped into three areas: a more aware and reflective\u000a      NGO sector; an improved understanding of the sector amongst wider\u000a      stakeholders; and new tools and methods for NGOs. To evaluate\u000a      these impacts, IDPM commissioned an independent study, undertaken by an\u000a      authoritative, senior and widely respected expert in the field (with\u000a      public honours in Canada), whose report concluded that: \"In terms of\u000a        their reach, the significance of the ideas propagated and the depth of\u000a        their influence, the four IDPM conferences and the associated volumes\u000a        represent a distinct and material contribution to the work and effort of\u000a        international development NGOs....an important response to\u000a        over-theorization and the need for more practical discourse\" [1].\u000a    Deeper reflection and understanding: The work of IDPM staff has\u000a      resulted in a more knowledgeable, prepared and reflective sector, with\u000a      knowledge emerging from both exposure to different perspectives through\u000a      participation in conferences, and influence on a generation of\u000a      practitioners via written texts. As a senior Bangladeshi NGO manager\u000a      notes: \"IDPM's key success was as a convening platform\", with\u000a      another senior practitioner-academic stating that: \"I don't know of any\u000a        other body of work that framed the debate in the way those conferences\u000a        did\" [1]. These debates provided an important resource for many\u000a      individuals. The former director of the Ford Foundation (Governance &amp;\u000a      Civil Society Programme), and a world-leading authority, exemplifies this,\u000a      stating that: \"I have observed the benefits on both the NGO sector\u000a        itself (collectively and in individual organizations) and other groups\u000a        and individuals, including beneficiaries and development agencies\"\u000a      [2] and noting in the Smillie report that \"IDPM's work has been `a\u000a        fundamentally important launch pad for things I've done in my\u000a        professional and intellectual life'\"[1]. Several interviewees\u000a      highlighted the particular value of the texts that emerged from IDPM's\u000a      work, a senior Indian NGO manager and regional sector expert arguing that:\u000a      \"This was precisely the divide that needed to be bridged... `How-to'\u000a        manuals don't do it and the heavy academic papers&#8212;who reads that stuff?\u000a        I still photocopy some of the articles for new staff to read\" [1].\u000a      Moreover, the significant impact of the research on the scale and depth of\u000a      reflection in the sector can be exemplified with respect to the particular\u000a      themes. For example, two key NGO practitioners (Jacobs and Wilford) argue\u000a      that \"Edwards and Hulme framed the debate on NGO accountability\"\u000a      [1]; the World Bank acknowledging the significance of Edwards and Hulme's\u000a      work in the concept and significance of downward accountability for NGOs;\u000a      and the Commonwealth Foundation highlighting accountability as a key issue\u000a      facing the NGO sector within a series of on-line forums in 2010, with the\u000a      background paper drawing extensively on this work, specifically [E][3].\u000a    Evidence of IDPM's continuing capacity to catalyse debate and challenge\u000a      thinking in and about the sector is provided by the discussion following a\u000a      Brooks World Poverty Institute (BWPI) paper published at UoM, which built\u000a      on earlier IDPM analysis with an updated and critical analysis of trends.\u000a      Duncan Green, Senior Strategic Advisor at Oxfam (GB) responded in his\u000a      widely followed blog, receiving 45 replies in the following four weeks,\u000a      with reference to earlier IDPM publications [4]. Mark Tran, who writes a\u000a      `Poverty Matters' blog for The Guardian newspaper contributed to the\u000a      debate, himself eliciting 16 comments in the five days afterwards. Very\u000a      specific engagements can also be noted, with contributions towards a\u000a      deeper reflection on governance issues across civil society and the state\u000a      provided by Bebbington's recent work with the Ministry of Environment in\u000a      El Salvador. This work builds on the collaborative research with PRISMA\u000a      [C] and has \"assisted in the formulation of a proposed new national\u000a        policy and associated legislation on mining, as well as in the\u000a        formulation of environmental governance strategy within the Ministry of\u000a        Environment\" [5].\u000a    Improved understanding of the sector leading to more effective\u000a        development work: A Dutch NGO senior manager with HIVOS cites the\u000a      monograph emerging out of the fourth IDPM conference as one of the best\u000a      books available to him, as he sought to address significant questions\u000a      facing his NGO [1]. Further evidence of the contribution of IDPM's work is\u000a      provided by BOND (the UK network of development NGOs) who list reference\u000a      [E] (above) as a key `library resource'. Similarly [D] was selected by\u000a      Palgrave MacMillan as one of eight titles republished to celebrate the\u000a      30th anniversary of their International Political Economy series. As\u000a      Palgrave confirm, the book \"was the first that we chose... the most\u000a        successful title in the series' history... clearly a great influence in\u000a        its field\" [6]. At a wider scale, the United Nations Research\u000a      Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) cite IDPM research in their\u000a      flagship 2010 publication, in analyses of NGO contributions to formulating\u000a      and implementing poverty reduction policies. UNRISD also contracted\u000a      Bebbington to analyse the role of social movements in poverty reduction\u000a      activities, with Bebbington drawing heavily on IDPM's work in his report\u000a      [7]. In addition, Hulme's research has been utilised by the Bangladeshi\u000a      NGO BRAC (assisting 126 million people) in the formulation of its\u000a      strategies. As noted by their former research coordinator \"evolving\u000a        from a critique of mainstream approaches such as microfinance,\u000a      [Hulme] has helped BRAC develop a programme to work with the\u000a        `ultra-poor' that reaches the lowest-income households with &#163;500 million\u000a        in aid finance... More generally... IDPM... has been helpful to BRAC in\u000a        contributing to their strategic analysis of the role of NGOs in\u000a        development\" [8]. This co-learning approach, between Hulme and UoM\u000a      colleagues and BRAC, has been further developed within subsequent research\u000a      financed by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) amongst\u000a      others.\u000a    New methods and tools: The impact of work on NGO\u000a        accountability has been enhanced by the crafting of novel approaches\u000a      that draw on IDPM's analysis. Since the mid-1990s NGOs have initiated\u000a      self-regulatory frameworks such as One World Trust's `Global\u000a      Accountability Report', with impact ongoing. The One World Trust states\u000a      that the rise of such frameworks is a response to IDPM work. An example of\u000a      further impact is provided by two international NGOs &#8212; Concern and Mango &#8212;\u000a      whose project `Listen First', introduced systematic approaches for\u000a      managing downward accountability; trials involved six countries and more\u000a      than 530 staff and advisers [A][9].\u000a    Finally, the protection of civil society autonomy has been taken\u000a      up through Mitlin's work with Shack\/Slum Dwellers International (SDI) to\u000a      strategize the development of their Urban Poor Fund International &#8212; a\u000a      multi-million dollar basket fund supported by bilateral development\u000a      assistance from Norway and Sweden, with contributions from the Bill and\u000a      Melinda Gates Foundation. The aim is to address the needs of the landless\u000a      urban poor in over 20 countries, supporting local women's led savings\u000a      schemes, thus addressing the needs of thousands of their members for\u000a      tenure, security and access to basic services. This has drawn on IDPM\u000a      research to manage and exploit opportunities provided at the global level,\u000a      supporting alternative modalities of development assistance that recognise\u000a      the need to empower and capacitate grassroots organisations and their\u000a      members. As SDI have confirmed to Mitlin: \"your work and that of\u000a        others at the University of Manchester has challenged the NGO sector to\u000a        think about their relations with grassroots organisations and the\u000a        political strategies that are likely to be successful in achieving\u000a        social justice and equity in towns and cities of the global south\"\u000a      [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of Manchester (UoM) highlights the\u000a      need to address issues of accountability and reflexivity within the NGO\u000a      sector, and has contributed towards both performance improvements within\u000a      individual NGOs, as well as the strengthening of sector-wide policies.\u000a      Impacts have been achieved through a process of ongoing consultation and\u000a      feedback: identifying, anticipating and analysing key challenges,\u000a      generating new conceptual frameworks, and building critical relations\u000a      between the academy and practitioners.

Research by the Institute for\u000a      Development Policy and Management (IDPM) at UoM has provided knowledge and\u000a      guidance to the sector over the last 20 years. Key staff include:\u000a      Professors Tony Bebbington (2003-date); Sam Hickey (2001-date); David\u000a      Hulme (1985-date); and Diana Mitlin (2001-date). Research findings\u000a          include:\u000a    (1) Increasing NGO impact and influence. The research has\u000a      advanced understandings of the key strategies that NGOs use to enhance\u000a      both their economic and political impacts, and their influence on\u000a      development policy and reach. Four strategies, previously analysed by\u000a      Hulme and Edwards, are considered: agency growth and replication,\u000a      alliances with government, alliances with social movements and other\u000a      grassroots organizations, and advocacy in the North [C]. Subsequent\u000a      research identified further strategies and constraints on impact. [C][E]\u000a    (2) Improving NGO effectiveness through developing alternative\u000a        accountability systems. The research found weak NGO accountability,\u000a      with their focus upwards to donors and governments and insufficient\u000a      consideration given to the views of beneficiaries and allied civil society\u000a      organizations. Alternative systems were proposed to offer more\u000a      comprehensive rigorous forms of accountability. [C][D]\u000a    (3) Maintaining autonomy in relations with the state. Negotiating\u000a      across collaboration, co-option and contestation, between NGOs and the\u000a      state, have been consistent research themes. Such relations potentially\u000a      compromise NGOs' critical identities, reducing their effectiveness and\u000a      restricting their capacity to elaborate alternative paradigms. Research\u000a      has highlighted the struggle for NGO autonomy, NGO strategies to manage\u000a      such relationships and positive and negative outcomes for their mission,\u000a      objectives and outcomes. [B][C][D]\u000a    (4) Managing and exploiting opportunities at the global level.\u000a      Research has considered the implications for NGOs and civil society\u000a      organisations of new opportunities that have emerged to engage with global\u000a      politics, alongside the opportunities and constraints faced as NGOs seek\u000a      to use such openings to their advantage, whilst confronting the difficult\u000a      challenge of maintaining their focus while being offered increased public\u000a      funding and legitimacy. [C][D]\u000a    Research modalities and activities: IDPM has taken on the\u000a      challenge to work with NGOs in order to better understand &#8212; whilst at the\u000a      same time seeking to improve &#8212; their contribution to development in the\u000a      Global South; primarily through a reflection on their core values,\u000a      capabilities and sector direction. Interventions have sought to influence\u000a      the attitudes, policies and behaviours of both NGOs and the governments\u000a      with which they interact, so as to lead to more effective development\u000a      interventions. Engaging with the whole NGO sector and influencing its\u000a      development through changing the understanding of agencies and\u000a      individuals, is necessarily more difficult and complex than undertaking a\u000a      single research project. A complex methodology was thus required, with\u000a      several key research tasks, that included:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aThe convening of a body of individuals to reflect and\u000a        institutionalise knowledge.\u000a      \u000aThe provision of conceptual frameworks through which to\u000a        understand NGOs and their roles, functions and contributions.\u000a      \u000aThe Identification and elaboration of critical challenges for\u000a        the sector.\u000a      \u000aThe consolidation of lessons, to improve policy, programming\u000a        direction and practices.\u000a    \u000a    The conference life cycle was utilised as the anchor modality for fusing\u000a      research and engagement (discussing themes ex ante, preparing\u000a      papers, meeting and debating, editing and publishing, etc.) Subsequent to\u000a      an initial conference (1991), conferences were held in 1995, 1999 and\u000a      2005. These gatherings provided shared learning spaces, with broadly equal\u000a      participation from academics and professional development practitioners.\u000a      The following design was used:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aIdentifying a set of critically reflective individuals able to\u000a        structure, lead and prepare conference debates, as well as contribute to\u000a        ongoing knowledge activities.\u000a      \u000aConvening the conference whilst analysing feedback, in order to\u000a        adjust and confirm core themes, as well as identify and develop of\u000a        alternative positions within each theme.\u000a      \u000aWorking with authors to prepare manuscripts for the edited\u000a        conference volumes, co-authoring and authoring introductions and\u000a        conclusions, alongside additional journal articles.\u000a    \u000a    Through these activities, research users from the NGO sector\u000a      became researchers themselves, gathering and analysing information and\u000a      becoming knowledge producers. In tandem, UoM researchers adopted a\u000a      `light touch' approach in order to manage, focus and deepen debate. As a\u000a      consequence, findings emerged that not only challenged the NGO sector,\u000a      articulating critical minority voices and sharpening debates, but which\u000a      were also co-produced and therefore owned by the sector. Subsequent\u000a      research activities have complemented this approach in:\u000a    \u000a      The development of knowledge partnerships between IDPM\u000a        academics embedded within civil societies in the global South to learn,\u000a        share ideas and deepen reach.\u000a      Generating associated consultancies to support programme and\u000a        policy reforms.\u000a      Formulating additional research projects, including ESRC-DFID\u000a        funded work on social movements and chronic poverty.

Her role was\u000a      described by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western\u000a      Asia (UN-ESCWA)\u000a      as \"important in that she was instrumental in bringing the right\u000a        stakeholders to the table and\u000a        facilitating productive discussions which resulted in a clearer\u000a        framework and pathway for inter-ministerial\u000a        collaboration in sustainable development in Lebanon\" [1]. Like many\u000a      countries emerging\u000a      from conflict, Lebanon faces the challenge of working towards a national\u000a      strategy that integrates\u000a      sustainable development alongside peace-building approaches. Since the\u000a      assassination of former\u000a      Prime Minister Hariri in 2005, Lebanon's political and social divisions\u000a      were exacerbated and this is\u000a      reflected in the (in)stability of governments. Since 2009, two governments\u000a      have collapsed before\u000a      their expiry date. These swift changes mean that new governments often\u000a      discount the work of\u000a      predecessors and set `new' priorities, either replicating efforts or\u000a      simply neglecting previous work.\u000a    The previous government (2009-2010) had signed an agreement to\u000a      collaborate with two UN\u000a      organisations &#8212; United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs\u000a      (UN-DESA) in New\u000a      York [2] and UN-ESCWA in Lebanon &#8212; in the drafting of an NSDS for Lebanon.\u000a      However, this\u000a      project was neglected with the collapse of the coalition government in\u000a      2010. The new government\u000a      remained polarized and the NSDS lost traction. The key problem was that,\u000a      at its inception, the new\u000a      government was keen to carry on with national planning in a sound and\u000a      sustainable manner, yet\u000a      the officials in charge were new to the process and had not yet scoped\u000a      previous efforts in this\u000a      domain. When the UN launched a series of meetings with experienced\u000a      stakeholders from the civil\u000a      service and non-governmental sectors, to proceed with discussions around\u000a      the NSDS, there was\u000a      little response. The NSDS required reiterative and cross-sectoral\u000a      participation in order to ensure\u000a      citizen ownership. The process was therefore brought to a halt.\u000a    Pathways to Impact: Based on background research on the existing\u000a      National Strategies since\u000a      1991 in the various line ministries [D], and after scoping the processes\u000a      undertaken to develop and\u000a      draft them, Obeid's first input was to recommend anthropological\u000a      approaches and methods that\u000a      would `give voice' to the people who are `active agents' in the making of\u000a      the state. Engaging with\u000a      them, and exploring their understandings and experiences of state\u000a      processes and the sustainability\u000a      of planning, would shed light on the steps needed for their ongoing\u000a      participation. Meeting with\u000a      several state and non-state actors &#8212; some associated with previous\u000a      governments and thus feeling\u000a      side-lined -over a period of one month (July 2010), led Obeid to suggest\u000a      in her report that various\u000a      actors &#8212; particularly civil servants within the government &#8212; were\u000a      sceptical of the prospect of drafting\u000a      a unified integrated national strategy in the absence of an official\u000a      inter-sectoral body that would\u000a      monitor the process and mediate the uncertain Lebanese political climate.\u000a      There was a fear that\u000a      work accomplished under one government would not be recognised by the next\u000a      &#8212; which could\u000a      discount strategies, plans and even committees as invalid &#8212; unless they\u000a      were undertaken within an\u000a      infrastructure that was recognised by high-powered office (such as that of\u000a      the Prime Minister). This\u000a      situation was primarily due to a schism between higher rank officials and\u000a      lower rank civil servants,\u000a      an issue that was endemic as the former invariably change when governments\u000a      fall, whilst the latter\u000a      do not.\u000a    Impact: In order to guarantee commitment to contribute to the\u000a      process of drafting the NSDS by the\u000a      relevant experienced stakeholders (civil servants from line ministries and\u000a      representatives of\u000a      NGOs), Obeid's report recommended that the UN liaise with the Lebanese\u000a        government to\u000a        formalise the process by introducing an institutional mechanism that\u000a        would ensure that\u000a        sustainable development outlooks were respected beyond each change of\u000a        government and\u000a        that the taskforce would be endorsed officially by the PM's Office in\u000a        order for it to have\u000a        credibility [1]. Indeed, Obeid and the UN team met with the PM's\u000a      representatives, conveying the\u000a      need to establish a specialised task-force as a `recommendation to\u000a      proceed.' As confirmed by the\u000a      Associate Programme Management Officer, UN-ESCWA: \"The Prime Minister's\u000a        Office\u000a        subsequently assigned a representative who was to attend the scheduled\u000a        consultation meetings,\u000a        and who announced at the second of these meetings that the Prime\u000a        Minister had pledged to create\u000a        an official body in due course\" [1].\u000a    The role played by Obeid, alongside the UN, was henceforth centred upon\u000a      attempts to create\u000a      appropriate conditions for the drafting of an NSDS for Lebanon. Once\u000a      official support was secured,\u000a      Obeid successfully brought together a team of experts from a range of\u000a      sectors &#8212; 12 Ministries,\u000a      three umbrella NGOs (comprised of NGOs from various regions of the\u000a      country), three UN\u000a      organisations, the EU and three national environmental NGOs &#8212; most of whom\u000a      had been involved\u000a      in previous national strategies and were experienced in the area of\u000a      planning. Through two\u000a      consultation meetings (September 2010 and May 2011), Obeid and the UN\u000a      facilitated a wide-ranging\u000a      conversation around the mechanisms needed to work towards an NSDS. The\u000a      experts\u000a      were first brought together for a training workshop on sustainable\u000a      development planning (as\u000a      opposed to the conventional sectoral planning in Lebanon that favoured the\u000a      economic pillar). This\u000a      was conducted by Obeid alongside a chosen Consultant, who outlines Obeid's\u000a      contribution:\u000a    \"Obeid recommended that the UN liaise with the Lebanese government to\u000a        introduce an\u000a        institutional mechanism... Obeid's contribution was important... she\u000a        successfully... convened\u000a        a broad range of Lebanese stakeholders and ensured that their myriad of\u000a        interests in\u000a        development are being considered by their peers and their leaders. And\u000a        because of her\u000a        expert grasp of development challenges and needs in Lebanon she ensured\u000a        that the\u000a        technical support of the United Nations provided to the Lebanese NSDS\u000a        process was\u000a        prudent, appropriate and impactful.\" [3]\u000a    In a later meeting (September 2011) which Obeid facilitated, the same\u000a      group was invited to\u000a      highlight national sustainable development priorities. Recommendations\u000a      from the meeting [4] -which\u000a      utilised Obeid's report [D] &#8212; fed into a regional Arab Report presented at\u000a      the Rio+20 UN\u000a      Conference on Sustainable Development in July 2012 [2]. Finally, as the\u000a      Sustainable Development\u000a      Officer (Division for Sustainable Development), United Nations Department\u000a      for Economic and\u000a      Social Affairs (UN-DESA) recounts:\u000a    \"In May 2012 the Prime Minister's Office identified the Ministry of\u000a      Environment as the host for\u000a      a sustainable development and multi-sectoral taskforce that would take the\u000a      lead in identifying\u000a      steps to mainstream sustainable development concepts in Lebanon, and to\u000a      begin to consider\u000a      a National Development Plan... Dr Obeid played a main and instrumental\u000a      role in\u000a      implementing the UN Secretariat project in Lebanon. Her research on past\u000a      and existing\u000a      national policies and strategies relating to economic, social and\u000a      environment objectives in the\u000a      country along with her recommendations on steps, components and entry\u000a      points to\u000a      sustainable development planning that fit Lebanon's specific conditions\u000a      and circumstances,\u000a      and her support to the organization and facilitation of a National\u000a      Training Workshop and a\u000a      regional awareness workshop ... in the MENA [Middle East and North\u000a    Africa] region highly\u000a      contributed to the successful implementation of the UN-DESA\/ESCWA capacity\u000a      building\u000a      project in post-conflict Lebanon.\" [2]\u000a    In conclusion, the impact claimed through this case is a product of\u000a      Obeid's research, which was\u000a      able to introduce an inclusive participatory process that shed light on\u000a      state and non-state actors'\u000a      understandings of and relations to state processes. The\u000a      group of experts represented, in\u000a      microcosm, a larger constituency in Lebanon that would have to be involved\u000a      in the process of\u000a      sustainable development planning for it to be conducive to ongoing\u000a      peace-building efforts. Obeid's\u000a      recommendations ultimately led to the `making official' of a task-force\u000a      that would outlive political\u000a      upheavals and the collapse of governments.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    On the basis of research on the anthropology of the state and sustainable\u000a      development, Dr\u000a      Michelle Obeid was invited to work with two UN organisations, taking the\u000a      lead in identifying key\u000a      governmental and non-governmental actors to develop a National Sustainable\u000a      Development\u000a      Strategy (NSDS) for Lebanon, with peace-building at its core. An inclusive\u000a      process was employed,\u000a      that consulted with lower rank civil servants and civil society actors. It\u000a      was concluded that an\u000a      official mechanism was needed to mediate the flux created by unforeseen\u000a      changing governments\u000a      (three between July 2009 and 2013) who tended to dismiss the work of their\u000a      predecessors. Acting\u000a      on Obeid's recommendations, in July 2012 the project culminated with the\u000a      creation of an official\u000a      task-force in the Ministry of Environment, endorsed by the Prime\u000a      Minister's Office.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    (all references available upon request &#8212; AUR)\u000a    The research has been published in leading anthropology journals, as well\u000a      as within a well-\u000a      regarded edited volume [A].\u000a    \u000a[A] (2012) Venkatesan, S. and Yarrow, T.

Obeid's work on the state is situated within\u000a      one of the Social\u000a      Anthropology discipline's core themes `States, Borders and Mobilities',\u000a      which includes research by\u000a      other colleagues at UoM, including: Harvey's work on `Unsettling the\u000a      State,' Reeves' work on `the\u000a      State in Central Asia,' Green's work on `State Frontiers,' and Jansen's\u000a      research on `Everyday\u000a      Engagements with the State.' The research advances recent intellectual\u000a      shifts in the understanding\u000a      of the state, as a site of fragmentation rather than a coherent entity,\u000a      calling for a comparative\u000a      approach that explores how states take on certain meanings for those they\u000a      govern.\u000a    Obeid's research in Lebanon builds on this body of work, investigating\u000a      local imaginings of the state\u000a      and how these are reproduced through the everyday lives of its citizens.\u000a      Until recently, literature on\u000a      Arab states had not given much attention to citizens' perspectives of\u000a      &#8212; and interactions with &#8212; their\u000a      states. Rather, governance (by state and non-state actors) had been\u000a      understood at central and\u000a      formal levels, without extending to `people,' and their lived realities as\u000a      citizens. Key research\u000a      insights advocate an understanding of `the state from within and below'\u000a      not just by academics, but\u000a      also by practitioners. Accordingly, concepts such as `the state' and\u000a      `sustainable development' only\u000a      come to life through the meanings they hold for subjects at different\u000a      levels of society.\u000a    The impacts outlined here were underpinned by four key outputs (a\u000a      workshop, two journal articles\u000a      and a book chapter) that focused on the themes of `understanding the\u000a      state' and `sustainable\u000a      development':\u000a    \u000a      The theme of `understanding the state' was developed initially\u000a        through a workshop on `The\u000a        Anthropology of the State: An Arab Perspective' (May 2008). In this\u000a        workshop, a group of\u000a        international scholars employed a comparative framework to examine how\u000a        Arab states are\u000a        understood through everyday experiences of their subjects. The research\u000a        findings, discussed\u000a        at this forum, confirmed the importance of unpacking the state\u000a        theoretically and understanding\u000a        the cross-cultural specificities revealed through the everyday, despite\u000a        the universalist claims of\u000a        states.\u000a      A later journal article, a product of the workshop, advocated an anthropological\u000a          approach\u000a        that sheds light on how citizens understand their state through everyday\u000a        interaction with its\u000a        apparatuses, institutions and persons [E]. The article argued that\u000a        residents of a border town at\u000a        the margin of the state are often strategists who desire to be\u000a        incorporated as active citizens.\u000a        The findings suggest that practitioners should take seriously this\u000a        desire to be involved in the\u000a        making of the state, and thus deploy an inclusive approach that takes\u000a        into account people's\u000a        `statism'.\u000a      The theme of the state was advanced further by another journal article\u000a        that explored `statism\u000a          and democracy' at the borders of Lebanon [C]. The article analyses\u000a        the 2004 elections that\u000a        saw the victory of the Muslim Brothers. The findings from this article\u000a        confirm border residents'\u000a        desires to be attached to national politics at `the centre.' Citizens\u000a        participate in democratic\u000a        elections as active agents who seek to be part of the project of the\u000a        (Lebanese) nation-state.\u000a      The theme of sustainable development in Lebanon was developed\u000a        in a comparative\u000a        workshop organised by colleagues at Manchester on `Differentiating\u000a        Development: Beyond an\u000a        Anthropology of Critique' (September 2008), later published in an edited\u000a        volume [A]. Obeid's\u000a        chapter explores the concept of sustainable development in the absence\u000a        of the state and the\u000a        dominant presence of development organisations on the northern border of\u000a        Lebanon [B]. Her\u000a        chapter brings out the dynamic between global concepts such as\u000a        sustainable development and\u000a        their local appropriations, thus bringing to life the localisation of\u000a        development.\u000a    \u000a    These four research outputs were the basis for a scoping study on the\u000a      existing development\u000a        strategies in Lebanon since 1991 (the end of the Civil War), which\u000a      resulted in a commissioned\u000a      report [D] for the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia\u000a      (UN-ESCWA). The report\u000a      outlined some of the new inter-sectoral and inter-ministerial linkages\u000a      that were on-going in\u000a      Lebanon, highlighting the areas in which the various strategies needed to\u000a      converge in order to\u000a      create a unified sustainable national development strategy that takes into\u000a      account linkages\u000a      between the three pillars of sustainable development; the social, economic\u000a      and environmental.\u000a      This report is the basis for the impact detailed below.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28132","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pathways to Impact: These were designed to promote dialogue, and\u000a      the translation of research findings for policymakers, including UNICEF\u000a      and others [1]. In the period prior to 2008, this was achieved via:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aConnections with user organisations. Green was invited to work\u000a        for 14 months (2004-5) on secondment from Manchester within DFID's\u000a        Policy Division. This positioning provided the basis from which her\u000a        impact-oriented social policy work evolved.\u000a      The convening of a specially selected international policy\u000a          audience at a two day Foreign and Commonwealth Office `Wilton\u000a        Park' meeting (2005) `Strengthening National responses to Children\u000a        Affected by HIV and AIDS...' Green was commissioned to provide a key\u000a        background paper [1].\u000a      The presentation of findings to a biennial meeting of policy\u000a        stakeholders from leading agencies around children and AIDS in the form\u000a        of a background paper, written by Green, for the Global Partner's Forum\u000a        (2006).\u000a      The development of a two DFID commissioned policy papers on\u000a        the potential contribution of state social protection for children\u000a        affected by HIV and AIDS (2007-8).\u000a    \u000a    The translation of research findings via engagement with policy forums\u000a      provides a bridge between the research and the later uptake of core\u000a      recommendations by the African Union. This uptake was part of a longer\u000a      term transition in programming around social policy and children, which\u000a      occurred at the same time as social protection approaches were becoming\u000a      mainstreamed in policy discourses. For example, UNICEF's 2004 guidance on\u000a      supporting children affected by HIV and AIDS &#8212; `Framework for the\u000a      Protection, Care And Support of Orphans And Vulnerable Children Living in\u000a      a World with HIV and AIDS' &#8212; highlighted five zones of intervention, of\u000a      which community and family structures were the most important [2].\u000a      Crucially, this framework failed to consider how children's vulnerability\u000a      and poverty might be related to limited state action. Instead, the\u000a      responsibility for supporting children affected by HIV\/AIDS fell on\u000a      families and communities, presented as `traditional' community safety\u000a      nets. Green's research instead proposed that child vulnerability is not\u000a      merely constituted by the presence of HIV and AIDS alone, but also through\u000a      the absence of state systems for supporting children and their families.\u000a      The research recommended that policy responses should promote the\u000a      development of state capacities for the delivery of social welfare,\u000a      particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and this must include sufficient\u000a      budget allocations for its effective delivery.\u000a    Impact 1 - UNICEF: This impact was set in motion 2005-6, and has\u000a      continued throughout the period 2008-13. In 2007, as a result of Green's\u000a      contribution to the Global Partners Forum (2006) that built on the Wilton\u000a      Park (2005) discussions, UNICEF revised their guidelines. As corroborated:\u000a      \"there was a substantial shift in the policy of UNICEF, and other\u000a        international donors, from 2005- 2006 onwards, with much greater\u000a        importance being given to the role of the state in building social\u000a        welfare capacity to support children and families affected by AIDS\"\u000a      [9] The revised guidelines were set out in UNICEF's 2007 report `Enhanced\u000a      Protection for Children Affected by AIDS...' [2]. Although support\u000a      for families and communities continued to receive attention, this new\u000a      document made the specific case for strengthening state systems and\u000a      prioritising social welfare as part of national programmes, rather than\u000a      leaving social welfare provision as the sole preserve of oftentimes\u000a      piecemeal NGO interventions. Whilst Green's background work at these fora,\u000a      alongside the recommendations taken forward, should rightly be considered\u000a      the product of the participating group, the link between the position\u000a      outlined by Green in the two papers, and the subsequent change of tack by\u000a      UNICEF are evident. The former head of UNICEF's AIDS section suggests\u000a        \"The work of Professor Green and others contributed to a crucial shift\u000a        in the strategies and policies of UNICEF, and other international\u000a        donors... The Wilton Park conference &#8212; for which Professor Green wrote\u000a        the background paper &#8212; was particularly important as the State's role in\u000a        the creating social welfare capacity was re-emphasised...\" [7]\u000a    This shift in UNICEF policy is part of an wider social policy transition,\u000a      on-going in the period 2008- 13, where cash transfers have been proposed\u000a      as a form of social support, and it is this wider framework within which\u000a      Green's research has operated and to which it has contributed. These\u000a      changes are particularly significant given UNICEF's role as the lead\u000a      agency in setting the parameters of `good practice' around programming for\u000a      the welfare of children. The change in this guidance is significant\u000a      because it has opened a space for the reinsertion of the state into social\u000a      policy programming, particularly in the African case where development\u000a      agencies have tended to bypass the state and to channel resources through\u000a      NGOs, claiming that state support is unnecessary because indigenous family\u000a      and community networks already `accommodate' the vulnerable.\u000a    Significantly, this overall shift can be seen in recent documents, such\u000a      as `Taking Evidence to Impact...' published by UNICEF\/IATT (Inter-Agency\u000a      Task Team for children affected by HIV and AIDS) in 2011, at the Global\u000a      Partners Forum in New York [3]. This report took the 2004\/2007 UNICEF\u000a      framework as its starting point, but then used recent evidence to indicate\u000a      that social welfare systems are a priority area. From 2012, IATT has had a\u000a      Working Group on Strengthening Child and Family Welfare Systems,\u000a      co-chaired by World Vision and USAID. Thus, as the former head of UNICEF's\u000a      AID section notes: \"Professor Green's contribution to a re-focussing on\u000a        the role of the state has been significant, and can be seen still today\"\u000a      [7], and this is confirmed by the Senior Policy Adviser, Vulnerable\u000a      Children and HIV &amp; AIDS at World Vision International, who confirms\u000a      that, subsequent to Green's work:\u000a    \"UNICEF and other donors, particularly USAID\/ PEPFAR, have given\u000a        greater emphasis to the importance of strengthening state social welfare\u000a        systems and less emphasis to the role of NGOs. This shift can be seen in\u000a        UNICEF's 2011 policy document ... which prioritised social welfare\u000a        systems strengthening `recognizing that the movement from pilots to\u000a          sustainable programmes can only be achieved when the relevant\u000a          government ministries are capacitated, equipped and financed to\u000a          oversee service delivery and track impacts'. It can also be seen\u000a        in USAID\/PEPFAR's 2012 Guidance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children\u000a        Programming which states that, in line with Green's work, `PEPFAR\u000a          programs should prioritize within their country context ... Supporting\u000a          host-country governments to initiate, expand, or be innovative in\u000a          their social protection initiatives at both the policy and operational\u000a          levels.'... Green's contribution to this policy shift through her\u000a        research, publications and involvement in policy discussions were\u000a        considerable and the long-term impact can be seen still today. The\u000a        single most important impact of Green's work is the recognition of the\u000a        need for governments in Africa, supported by the international\u000a        community, to strengthen state social welfare systems.\" [4][9][10] (policy\u000a        docs underlined)\u000a    Impact 2 - African Union: Green's ongoing work continues to make\u000a      the case for considering how the design of states can limit capacities for\u000a      addressing the social welfare needs of citizens. She was commissioned by\u000a      DFID to produce an analytical paper as background to the Second Session of\u000a      the African Union Conference of Ministers of Social Development in\u000a      Khartoum (21-25 September 2010) [5]. The paper examined core constraints\u000a      on the capacities of member states to implement the Social Policy\u000a      Framework for Africa (2008). Green's recommendations reiterated priorities\u000a      from previous research regarding the importance of state capacity and\u000a      adequate fiscal space. They were adopted by member states, with the AU\u000a      Executive Council endorsing, in particular, the recommendation that: \"The\u000a        implementation of the Social Policy Framework for Africa should be\u000a        accelerated at national, regional and continental levels\"; and\u000a      requesting that the AU Commission: \"Facilitate capacity building\u000a        activities for social policy analysis in Member States and devise\u000a        strategies for the successful implementation of the Social Policy\u000a        Framework for Africa (SPF)\" [6]. Once again, Green's work had proved\u000a      important in setting out an agenda for considering the importance of state\u000a      capacity in relation to ongoing welfare outcomes, particularly in\u000a      Africa, and not only in relation to AIDS. As HelpAge\u000a      International's Head of Strategic Alliances confirms:\u000a    \"HelpAge and UNICEF have a MOU for joint work and policy influence &#8212;\u000a        with much greater importance being given to the role of the state in\u000a        building social welfare capacity to support families affected by AIDS.\u000a        This also supported the uptake of core recommendations (for instance a\u000a        `minimum package' of child and old age pensions, disability benefits and\u000a        health inputs together with reinforcing the role of social institutions)\u000a        by the African Union. This uptake was part of a longer term transition\u000a        in programming and policy prioritisation running concurrently with\u000a        growing international commitment to social protection packages including\u000a        the concept to the `social protection floor'. Professor Green's ongoing\u000a        work has continued to make the case for considering how the design of\u000a        states can limit &#8212; or enhance &#8212; national capacities for the social\u000a        welfare of citizens.\" [8].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of Manchester (UoM) confronts\u000a      deficits in social policy in sub-Saharan Africa, emphasising the promotion\u000a      of state capacities for the delivery of social welfare, The research has\u000a      engaged with users (2003-present), and has contributed to demonstrable\u000a      policy shifts towards strengthening social welfare systems.

It evolved from\u000a      previous fieldwork undertaken in East Africa on local social organisation,\u000a      gender and kinship, gaining a more pronounced policy orientation via a\u000a      focus upon the issue of poverty and vulnerability in sub-Saharan Africa\u000a      which developed from engagement in policy-oriented research clusters.\u000a    This later work was undertaken in conjunction with UoM colleagues, based\u000a      at the School of Environment and Development (SED), working on poverty and\u000a      development and in support of the analytical requirements of the `Reaching\u000a      the Poorest Policy Team' at the Department for International Development\u000a      (DFID) to which Green was seconded (2004-5) as a poverty adviser. Green's\u000a      work on poverty and social policy explored the distinctive and\u000a      wide-ranging factors that contribute to poverty in Africa, the impacts of\u000a      social exclusion and the differences - and differential effects on\u000a      individual citizens &#8212; between poverty and destitution in the region. It\u000a      was based on field research in Tanzania, field visits to Kenya and\u000a      Ethiopia and the comparative analysis of other countries in Eastern,\u000a      Central and Southern Africa. Findings suggest that:\u000a    \u000a      The widespread incapacity to deliver social welfare is not a\u000a        consequence of weak states, as political science often claims, but is\u000a        rather `designed into' state systems [A].\u000a      \u000aSocial institutions continue to be vital in addressing poverty\u000a          outcomes. More specifically, targeted interventions, directed at\u000a        poverty and vulnerability, need to address the distributive role of the\u000a        state. The focus must therefore be shifted away from fragmented\u000a        interventions and ad hoc responses through non-state actors,\u000a        which fail to adequately develop state capacity [D][E].\u000a      \u000aA defining characteristic of destitution is the absence of social\u000a          support, through either social relations of kinship or proximity.\u000a        Once again, the absence of state-based social support has a significant\u000a        impact on poverty outcomes, in a manner not dissimilar to existing\u000a        indigenous forms of social exclusion (e.g. the institutions of\u000a        witchcraft) [B][C].\u000a    \u000a    The initial research on poverty and social exclusion was financed through\u000a      the DFID-funded `Chronic Poverty Research Centre' (CPRC) and the ESRC\u000a      `Global Poverty Research Group' (GPRG). Green was an active member of\u000a      both, producing a number of quality outputs. The 2009 external evaluators'\u000a      report on GPRG stated: \"In terms of high quality research publications,\u000a        the output of the Group is excellent and far better than that achieved\u000a        by any other development research programme of comparable size of which\u000a        we are aware, ESRC or any other.\"\u000a    Social policy is underdeveloped in sub-Saharan Africa, with the focus on\u000a      local communities and NGOs to provide support for the vulnerable. This\u000a      detracts from the policy potential of social welfare interventions by the\u000a      state. Based on Green's work within the `Reaching the Poorest Policy Team'\u000a      &#8212; examining factors contributing to vulnerability and destitution,\u000a      particularly as they affected children &#8212; UNICEF funded Green (in 2005) to\u000a      conduct a study examining the specific issues of children (including\u000a      orphans) affected by HIV and AIDS. This project foregrounded links between\u000a      state failure in the delivery of welfare outcomes and wider issues around\u000a      vulnerability. Green concluded that children's vulnerability was not an\u000a      inevitable effect of the AIDS pandemic, but was accentuated by the absence\u000a      of wider forms of social support. This absence &#8212; an ongoing consequence of\u000a      the historical and political development of African states &#8212; was\u000a      maintained by donor policies that ignored the state, instead prioritising\u000a      NGOs and communities. The myth of `incapable states', alongside the\u000a      inevitable reality of African poverty, was thereby perpetuated. These\u000a      findings have also informed Green's work in 2010 for the African Union on\u000a      social policy development, and more recently as part of a UoM DFID-funded\u000a      research programme, on `Effective States and Inclusive Development'\u000a      (ESID), which again highlights social citizenship in Africa in relation to\u000a      both state architectures for social welfare, and the rights and\u000a      entitlements of citizens [A].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28133","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context: Standard methods for assessing aircraft noise fail to\u000d\u000a      account for: firstly, the effects of\u000d\u000a      noise exposure on the conduct of everyday life; secondly, the\u000d\u000a      states of anxiety produced by the\u000d\u000a      expectation of noise even when it is not strictly audible; and thirdly,\u000d\u000a      the relationship of those\u000d\u000a      sounds classified as noise with other sounds heard as part of the\u000d\u000a      inhabiting of a particular\u000d\u000a      environment. This research draws attention to the way acoustic data are\u000d\u000a      produced and used in\u000d\u000a      Japan, yet has wider applicability for other areas of the globe.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to Impact: Sound recordings were presented in a variety\u000d\u000a      of formats. Firstly, a track from\u000d\u000a      [C] was featured in a CD distributed with the avant-garde magazine The\u000d\u000a        Wire (circ. ~30,000) [1].\u000d\u000a      Secondly, recordings were made available via the Sensory Studies\u000d\u000a      website [2]. Thirdly, a short film\u000d\u000a      was commissioned for the Al Jazeera programme `People and Power'\u000d\u000a      on the role of women in\u000d\u000a      citizens' anti-base movements in Okinawa [3]. Finally, an art installation\u000d\u000a      &#8212; `Air Pressure: Aircraft\u000d\u000a      Noise and Perceptions of the Environment' &#8212; was exhibited at the Whitworth\u000d\u000a      Art Gallery\u000d\u000a      (Manchester). The Guardian newspaper noted the exhibition's directness: \"Air\u000d\u000a        Pressure creatively\u000d\u000a        documents the cultural clash between the lifestyle of traditional\u000d\u000a        farming and the turbulent thrills of\u000d\u000a        international air travel. Focusing on two families who defiantly\u000d\u000a        continue to farm at the end of\u000d\u000a        Japan's Narita Airport runway... as an artwork, its audio-visual impact\u000d\u000a        is more spectacularly\u000d\u000a        immersive than academically informative. Dare I say it: the thrust and\u000d\u000a        roar of planes can be\u000d\u000a        uplifting after all\" [4]. The Whitworth run (November 2011 &#8212;\u000d\u000a      February 2012) included a `Japan\u000d\u000a      Society for the Promotion of Science' (JSPS) symposium `Risky Engagements:\u000d\u000a      Encounters\u000d\u000a      between Science, Art and Public Health' (5-6th January 2012),\u000d\u000a      that included a two-hour open\u000d\u000a      session in the Gallery, attended by ~50 people who were able to make a\u000d\u000a      direct connection\u000d\u000a      between the immersive installation (and its related outputs) and the\u000d\u000a      questions raised around the\u000d\u000a      lack of accountability these scenarios often reveal. The symposium brought\u000d\u000a      together Japanese\u000d\u000a      public health scientists with anthropologists and artists from the UK.\u000d\u000a      Discussion centred upon how\u000d\u000a      art-science collaborations (and `scientific communication') may be\u000d\u000a      structured to affect `bottom-up'\u000d\u000a      policy change [5]. The seminar also included Japanese academics involved\u000d\u000a      in the study of the\u000d\u000a      impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. As the UK President, Japan\u000d\u000a      Society for the Promotion of\u000d\u000a      Science outlines: \"Through the conference the distinctive approach to\u000d\u000a        the position of social science\u000d\u000a        in the art-science interface that Air Pressure represented was made part\u000d\u000a        of a discussion about the\u000d\u000a        opening up in Japan of a new method of inquiry into environmental\u000d\u000a        problems.\" This has already led\u000d\u000a      to concrete plans \"to develop this research method further in a\u000d\u000a        multi-team member project across\u000d\u000a        the Asia Pacific\" [6]. Soon afterwards, the sound film from the\u000d\u000a      exhibition &#8212; `Ki-atsu: The Sound of\u000d\u000a      the Sky being Torn' [4] &#8212; was accepted for competition at: ISEA 2012 (one\u000d\u000a      of 50 film works\u000d\u000a      selected from 1500 entries); Bideodromo 2012 (one of 69 works\u000d\u000a      selected from 467 films) and the\u000d\u000a      IX Media Art Monographic Show 2013 (Colombia). It has also recently been\u000d\u000a      accessioned into the\u000d\u000a      permanent collection of the Haus f&#252;r Elektronische K&#252;nste (Basel).\u000d\u000a    (1) Primary Impact: Local authorities in Japan have adopted new ways\u000d\u000a        of promoting the\u000d\u000a        public understanding of acoustic science, with a view to enhancing\u000d\u000a        public debates on\u000d\u000a        aircraft noise. In Japan, where the media report on aircraft noise\u000d\u000a      as a matter of national interest,\u000d\u000a      public meetings and events around aircraft noise have become nodal points\u000d\u000a      in the formulation of\u000d\u000a      aircraft operating policies, and have tested the evidential status of\u000d\u000a      acoustic data in ways that\u000d\u000a      directly inform legal cases. As the UK President, Japan Society for the\u000d\u000a      Promotion of Science\u000d\u000a      confirms, with reference to his own foundational research: \"this new\u000d\u000a        way of presenting acoustic\u000d\u000a        evidence, alongside personal testimony, has greatly assisted attempts to\u000d\u000a        breach a long-standing\u000d\u000a        impasse in negotiations over aircraft noise, involving citizens, local\u000d\u000a        authorities, the military and the\u000d\u000a        private sector\" [6]. In April 2013 the exhibition was shown in two\u000d\u000a      locations and discussed at a\u000d\u000a      public event held at the science centre in Nago city (5th April\u000d\u000a      2012), with Cox interviewed by\u000d\u000a      Ryukyu Shinpo and the Okinawa Times &#8212; the latter quoting\u000d\u000a      Cox's aim \"to express the context for\u000d\u000a        the noise, and to use the power of art to explore whether it is damaging\u000d\u000a        to everyday life\" [7].\u000d\u000a    Okinawa Museum of Art and History (Naha City): In Okinawa, a group\u000d\u000a      of public officials led by\u000d\u000a      the senior environmental health official, organised and provided payment\u000d\u000a      for the installation to be\u000d\u000a      exhibited, and facilitated newspaper interviews with Cox. The Head of the\u000d\u000a      Prefectural\u000d\u000a      Government's Department of Environmental and Community Affairs noted that\u000d\u000a      the event: \"received\u000d\u000a        the support of the Prefectural Government... A large number of people\u000d\u000a        were able to experience\u000d\u000a        aircraft noise through visual media, enabling them to gain a vicarious\u000d\u000a        insight in to the way aircraft\u000d\u000a        noise affects living conditions. This will help resolve issues of\u000d\u000a        aircraft noise in the future... By\u000d\u000a        expressing the aircraft noise that invades the farming community living\u000d\u000a        in the vicinity of Narita\u000d\u000a        Airport as an art film, viewers were able to familiarise themselves with\u000d\u000a        the issues of aircraft noise.\u000d\u000a        We hope that this experience will help inform the debate as we work to\u000d\u000a        improve issues of aircraft\u000d\u000a        noise from the US military bases in Okinawa\" [8]. Additionally,\u000d\u000a      testimony from a member of the\u000d\u000a      Okinawa epidemiological survey &#8212; a specialist in the psychology of\u000d\u000a      disorders related to aircraft\u000d\u000a      noise and the traumatic memories of the war in Okinawa &#8212; noted how\u000d\u000a      visitors to the exhibition were\u000d\u000a      able to appreciate the portrayal of the farmers' lives, and the use of the\u000d\u000a      data-image from the\u000d\u000a      Nittobo microphone, also remarking that: \"some people commented\u000d\u000a        that they hadn't realised there\u000d\u000a        were still people living like this in Narita... there were plenty of\u000d\u000a        people who asked for a similar\u000d\u000a        piece of art to be created from fieldwork at military bases like Kadena\u000d\u000a        and Futenma\" [9]. The\u000d\u000a      publicity surrounding the exhibition led to a visit to the exhibition by\u000d\u000a      the Futenma district mayor,\u000d\u000a      who asked that Cox and Hiramatsu use the method of combining sound\u000d\u000a      measurements and audio-\u000d\u000a      visual recordings to describe the effects of Osprey helicopters, operating\u000d\u000a      out of the Futenma base.\u000d\u000a    Narita Bunka-kaikan (Cultural Hall): Narita City Council's\u000d\u000a      educational division sponsored Cox's\u000d\u000a      exhibition and distributed 8,000 leaflets about the installation to local\u000d\u000a      schools. The leaflet\u000d\u000a      connected the research behind the installation to on-going questions\u000d\u000a      around the effects on public\u000d\u000a      health of aircraft noise continuing until late at night, and it encouraged\u000d\u000a      Narita residents to attend.\u000d\u000a      The exhibition was covered in Mainichi Shinbun (morning\u000d\u000a      circulation ~3.45million), which led to\u000d\u000a      visits from the main players in the current debate &#8212; including the mayor\u000d\u000a      of Narita city, anti-airport\u000d\u000a      protestors and local farmers. Both the Mainichi Shinbun article\u000d\u000a      and testimony from the Narita\u000d\u000a      Prefecture Council note how the installation refocused the role of\u000d\u000a      measurement techniques in\u000d\u000a      estimating noise effects, away from their entrenchment of the political\u000d\u000a      positions of the affected\u000d\u000a      parties, and towards an appreciation of the environmental issues at stake\u000d\u000a      [7][10]. The Narita city\u000d\u000a      authorities have been in dispute with the community of farmers displaced\u000d\u000a      by Narita airport for over\u000d\u000a      forty years, and in the week of the exhibition the airport authority's\u000d\u000a      decision to extend the night time\u000d\u000a      flight curfew (from 11pm to 12pm) was being publically contested. The\u000d\u000a      engagement of all parties\u000d\u000a      with the research behind this exhibition has helped address this impasse.\u000d\u000a      The Narita Prefecture\u000d\u000a      Council officer responsible for monitoring relations between airport\u000d\u000a      authorities, local residents and\u000d\u000a      acoustic scientists for the last thirty years affirmed that: \"many\u000d\u000a        people were moved by the sincerity\u000d\u000a        of the Shimamura family and their devotion to farming the land...

Firstly, to extend\u000d\u000a      and re-interpret the\u000d\u000a        scientific evidence presented by acoustic scientists in public\u000d\u000a      meetings and court proceedings\u000d\u000a      over the last twenty years. Secondly, to improve the accessibility of\u000d\u000a        evidence presented to varied\u000d\u000a      publics (citizen groups, government officials, lawyers, judges, the media,\u000d\u000a      etc.) Thirdly, to add new\u000d\u000a        and rigorously evidenced dimensions to the ongoing assessment of the\u000d\u000a      impact of aircraft noise.\u000d\u000a    (2) Secondary Impact: The methods developed through this research\u000d\u000a      emerge from a social\u000d\u000a      scientific interface between art and acoustic science, and have had an impact\u000d\u000a        on how sound\u000d\u000a        data are understood in relation to noise pollution. Crucially, this\u000d\u000a      led to a fruitful working\u000d\u000a      relationship with Nittobo &#8212; one of the two companies who\u000d\u000a      manufacture the sound monitors used in\u000d\u000a      Japan's domestic and military airports [D]. As the UK President, Japan\u000d\u000a      Society for the Promotion of\u000d\u000a      Science Research confirms: \"The importance of the research was\u000d\u000a        acknowledged by Nittobo,\u000d\u000a        whose managing director asked permission to test a new prototype sound\u000d\u000a        monitor in a position that\u000d\u000a        we had identified on the site, where unmonitored noise from aircraft on\u000d\u000a        the ground was felt most\u000d\u000a        intensely by the local farmers\" [6].\u000d\u000a    Whilst the research is of immediate consequence for the citizens of\u000d\u000a      Narita and Kadena seeking to\u000d\u000a      halt the extension of airport activity, it was also notable that the research\u000d\u000a        methods utilised have\u000d\u000a        a universal applicability. Exhibiting `Air Pressure' at the 2012\u000d\u000a      ISEA festival (Albuquerque) &#8212; one\u000d\u000a      of the world's oldest and most prestigious electronic arts festivals &#8212; substantiated the significance\u000d\u000a      of the methods employed, and their public value. The exhibition stood out\u000d\u000a      as an alternative to the\u000d\u000a      sustainability discourses that commonly shape narratives around mechanical\u000d\u000a      technologies and\u000d\u000a      their environmental effects. The location of the festival allowed the work\u000d\u000a      on Narita to be brought\u000d\u000a      into dialogue with similar projects, such as one that dealt with the\u000d\u000a      problems of aircraft noise in\u000d\u000a      Tucson, Arizona. General acclaim led to `Air Pressure' being displayed at\u000d\u000a      the Albuquerque\u000d\u000a      Museum of Art and History for an additional four months (November 2012 &#8212;\u000d\u000a      February 2013).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of Manchester (UoM) considers the\u000d\u000a      association between\u000d\u000a      aircraft noise, human health and everyday life. In partnership with an\u000d\u000a      eminent Japanese acoustic\u000d\u000a      scientist, the issue of noise emanating out of the Kadena US airbase\u000d\u000a      (Okinawa Island) and Tokyo\u000d\u000a      Narita Airport was addressed through the creation of an innovative\u000d\u000a      exhibition.

This work took forward earlier research\u000d\u000a      (1995-1999), undertaken\u000d\u000a      by Japan's foremost acoustic scientist, Kozo Hiramatsu (Emeritus\u000d\u000a      Professor, Kyoto University; UK\u000d\u000a      President, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science). Hiramatsu's\u000d\u000a      research had established a\u000d\u000a      scientific basis for the negative effects of aircraft noise emanating from\u000d\u000a      the Kadena US airbase.\u000d\u000a    Background: The association between aircraft noise, human health\u000d\u000a      and everyday life is keenly\u000d\u000a      negotiated between aviation authorities and affected populations\u000d\u000a      worldwide. However, negotiations\u000d\u000a      are generally based on modelling, rather than through either an assessment\u000d\u000a      of the daily\u000d\u000a      experiences of living with aircraft noise, or the health effects that\u000d\u000a      manifest when aircraft are not\u000d\u000a      audibly present. The socio-cultural basis of vulnerability to noise is\u000d\u000a        absent from these data. Cox's\u000d\u000a      anthropological perspective addresses this gap, revealing the forms of\u000d\u000a      social life that develop in\u000d\u000a      response to daily noise. Via the playback of recordings during interviews\u000d\u000a      with residents (who were\u000d\u000a      involved in the original research) important vulnerability factors &#8212; links\u000d\u000a      between psycho-somatic\u000d\u000a      conditions, acoustic experience and the symbolic significance of aircraft\u000d\u000a      &#8212; were established.\u000d\u000a    The research redefined conventional paradigms and measuring\u000d\u000a        mechanisms, by rendering\u000d\u000a        categories of `noise' in terms of daily `lived experience' rather than\u000d\u000a        through reference to a\u000d\u000a        yearly average; this demonstrated how vulnerability factors are created\u000d\u000a        by social and\u000d\u000a        political relations. Converting noise data into forms of description\u000d\u000a      &#8212; via the transplantation of\u000d\u000a      sound environments into an immersive gallery installation &#8212; allowed the\u000d\u000a      public to critically engage\u000d\u000a      with these issues [A][D]. The research was operationalised through the\u000d\u000a      mapping of acoustic data\u000d\u000a      onto the `descriptive media' of sound recordings, centring on a farm\u000d\u000a      inside Narita airport. This\u000d\u000a      involved the re-creation of an entire sound environment within a gallery\u000d\u000a      installation, acting as a\u000d\u000a      realistic surrogate for the acoustic laboratory. This demonstrates the\u000d\u000a      inadequacies of the airport\u000d\u000a      authorities' current measuring devices, which fail to monitor aspects such\u000d\u000a      as the sound of planes\u000d\u000a      on the ground. The translation of acoustic science data into descriptive\u000d\u000a      and immersive multi-media\u000d\u000a      (sound recordings and film) [B], revealed the following insights:\u000d\u000a    1. Acoustic logic: A systematic method of description was provided\u000d\u000a      that addressed absences in\u000d\u000a      the WECPNL formula (weighted equivalent perceived noise level) used in\u000d\u000a      Japan. This formula\u000d\u000a      creates a mean average of the effects of noise over a year, but fails to\u000d\u000a      account for the effects\u000d\u000a      of `everyday noise'. A breakthrough was achieved by adding critical detail\u000d\u000a      to the\u000d\u000a      conceptualisation of noise, showing its relationship to both individual\u000d\u000a      experience and other\u000d\u000a      sounds in the environment [A][C][D].\u000d\u000a    2. Environmental monitoring: In Okinawa the research showed that\u000d\u000a      the two different sound\u000d\u000a      monitoring devices &#8212; the Rion type used by the Japanese government\u000d\u000a      and the Nittobo type\u000d\u000a      employed by local government and the citizens' groups seeking compensation\u000d\u000a      &#8212; operate\u000d\u000a      according to different acoustic logics, in effect capturing different sets\u000d\u000a      of relationships between\u000d\u000a      aircraft noise and everyday life [D]. The Nittobo picked up all\u000d\u000a      sounds over a certain volume,\u000d\u000a      revealing the position of aircraft noise in a shifting sound world. The Rion\u000d\u000a      only monitored\u000d\u000a      aircraft in flight, locating aircraft sound in an abstract system of air\u000d\u000a      space. In Narita, findings\u000d\u000a      were developed to show how the visual image of sound, offered by Nittobo's\u000d\u000a      new sound\u000d\u000a      monitoring technologies, presented a perspective that could be linked back\u000d\u000a      to the lived\u000d\u000a      experience of the site [E].\u000d\u000a    3. Categorical anomalies: In both Narita and Kadena it was shown\u000d\u000a      that for health and safety\u000d\u000a      purposes what counts as `noise' in the context of work carried out inside\u000d\u000a      the airport\/air base\u000d\u000a      differs from what counts for those living outside its confines. For the\u000d\u000a      latter, noise generated by\u000d\u000a      airport activity at ground level (rather than in the air) was not\u000d\u000a      being counted as `noise' [A][C].\u000d\u000a    4. Cultural associations: In Okinawa the sound of over-flying US\u000d\u000a      military aircraft was a\u000d\u000a      vulnerability factor, stirring up traumatic memories of the Pacific war\u000d\u000a      for locals, yet being\u000d\u000a      described by US service personnel inside the base in triumphal terms, such\u000d\u000a      as `the sound of\u000d\u000a      freedom'. In Narita, for those living inside or near the airport the noise\u000d\u000a      of planes echoed a forty\u000d\u000a      year history of protest against the airport, and of forced evictions by\u000d\u000a      its authorities [A][C].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28666","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    LJMU research underpinned the following impacts:\u000a    \u000a      Substantially informed the content and presentation of four BBC2 TV\u000a        programmes [1,2,3,4]\u000a\u000a      Increased the understanding of evolutionary anthropology by engaging\u000a        millions of people around the world via the medium of mainstream\u000a        broadcast TV [i, ii, iii, iv] and an accompanying exhibition [iv] [1,2,3,4]\u000a\u000a      Improved the performance of the creative industries by helping secure\u000a        ~&#163;1m in commissions and enabling production of programmes about topics\u000a        that are not easily communicated through the medium of television [i,\u000a        ii, iii, iv], [1,2,3,4]\u000a\u000a    \u000a    The four programmes discussed in this case study and their underpinning\u000a      research are:\u000a    i.

These use his expertise\u000a      on and behind the scenes to create and inform the content and direction of\u000a      these programmes. Television producers seek to represent the evolving\u000a      human form in a well-grounded yet accessible context. In this milieu,\u000a      Wheeler's research reconstructing hominid behaviour, palaeobiology and\u000a      palaeoecology [1,2,3,4] is inherently more useful than most\u000a      palaeoanthropology research, which focuses upon phylogenetic\u000a      reconstruction.

His research was considered to be\u000a      `fantastic', and he was `very helpful with the research into the\u000a      programme' and gave a `very informative' interview (for i, D).\u000a    LJMU research increased the understanding of evolutionary anthropology\u000a        by engaging millions of people around the world via the medium of\u000a        mainstream broadcast TV [i,ii,iii,iv] and an accompanying exhibition\u000a        [iv]\u000a    Ratings for the initial broadcasts of these programmes:\u000a    \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Ref.\u000a          Series\u000a          Title\u000a          Original broadcast\u000a          Viewers\u000a            (millions) [A,B]\u000a\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          i\u000a          Horizon\u000a          Did Cooking Make Us Human?\u000a          02.03.2010\u000a          2.2\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          ii\u000a          Horizon\u000a          What's the Problem with Nudity?\u000a          03.03.2009\u000a          1.9\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          iii\u000a          Origins of Us\u000a          Guts\u000a          24.10.2011\u000a          1.7\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          iv\u000a          Prehistoric Autopsy\u000a          Homo erectus\u000a          24.10.2012\u000a          1.2\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    Collectively these programmes reached 7 million UK viewers on their\u000a      original broadcasts, and achieved a viewing market share between 4.7-7.6 %\u000a      of all viewers, which is excellent for science broadcasts [A, B, D, E].\u000a      Programmes were rebroadcast on the BBC and more recent ones available for\u000a      download from the internet via their iPlayer application (figures only\u000a      available for iii = 96k downloads; iv = 111k downloads, E).\u000a      Furthermore, these programmes are sold to broadcasters overseas and\u000a      retransmitted, although viewing figure are not available. The range of\u000a      countries where these programmes have been purchased and rebroadcast\u000a      includes Australia (i,ii), Mexico (ii) , New Zealand (ii), New Zealand\u000a      (ii), Belgium (ii), Italy (ii), Netherlands (ii), Israel (ii), Denmark\u000a      (ii), Spain (ii) South Africa (SABC; ii) , USA (i, ii) and Germany (i, ii)\u000a      Hungary (iii), Finland (ii, iii) Sweden (ii, iii). A DVD was released for\u000a      (iv), and this programme was available for download via iTunes, widening\u000a      its reach and permanence. Horizon is co-produced by the Discovery\u000a      Channel and rebroadcast extensively on that network (i,ii) [E].\u000a      These episodes have also been sold for in-flight entertainment on\u000a      Emirates and other airlines [E].\u000a    Programme iv had a public outreach strategy which included public\u000a      lectures and exhibits at Birmingham Thinktank (22 - 25 October 2012);\u000a      Manchester Museum (27 - 30 October 2012); Great North Museum Hancock,\u000a      Newcastle (1- 4 November 2012); National Museum Cardiff (8 - 11 November\u000a      2012); Horniman Museum, London: (14 - 18 November 2012); National Museum,\u000a      Scotland (23 - 25 November 2012). De Groote gave Prehistoric Autopsy\u000a      Uncovered talks at Manchester Museum (29 October 2012); Great North Museum\u000a      (4 November 2012); and at Horniman Museum (18 November 2012) and wrote an\u000a      accompanying article for Focus magazine (September 2012 issue\u000a      246). The museums contacted confirmed good visitor numbers for the dates\u000a      associated with the talks and exhibitions. Following one talk (London,\u000a      n=35) audience volunteers completed a short survey which showed that 63%\u000a      of respondents had changed their ideas about human evolution by the talk\u000a      and series, and an additional 13% felt their knowledge was expanded.\u000a      Crucially, of those surveyed 77% were able to recount a feature of human\u000a      evolution which they had learned from the series and talk, demonstrating\u000a      the efficacy of this programming and outreach in increasing the\u000a      understanding of human evolution.\u000a    LJMU Research Improved the performance of the creative industries by\u000a        helping secure ~&#163;1m in commissions and enabling production of programmes\u000a        about topics that are not easily communicated through the medium of\u000a        television\u000a    Figures from the BBC website and from the producers consulted confirm\u000a      that each of these programmes had a budget ranging from &#163;127k - &#163;140k to\u000a      produce [C,D,E]. Securing the participation of academic staff who\u000a      will provide their research and ideas is often important in the\u000a      commissioning decisions, and provides a guarantee that the production\u000a      companies will make interesting, factual, and informative programmes.\u000a      Often Wheeler is consulted at an early stage of the project so his\u000a      expertise is essential to the programmes getting funding and being\u000a      produced. Further, the success of science programmes underpinned by LJMU\u000a      research helps secure commissions for other programmes within the genre,\u000a      for example the success of Horizon programmes (i, ii) led to the series\u000a      commission for (iii; 5 episodes) [D].\u000a    Another impact of our research and consultancy is providing input to\u000a      production companies about what is not easily communicated through the\u000a      medium of television, as was the case for an episode of Bang Goes the\u000a        Theory; this was described as essential assistance and \"one of the\u000a      `hidden' values of academic consultation.\" [E,1,3]. It is\u000a      difficult to make a television programme purely about fossil bones and\u000a      teeth so the fleshing-out that Wheeler's research makes possible is\u000a      instrumental to the interface between the science and the general public.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    LJMU's Research Centre in Evolutionary Anthropology and Palaeoecology\u000a      actively engages with broadcasters and the creative sector, providing a\u000a      significant evidence base and impacting the commissioning and content of\u000a      television programming about human evolution.

Wheeler's research\u000a      therefore provides a conceptual framework upon which the visual\u000a      realisations required for television can be scientifically based. It is\u000a      the specific nature of these research outcomes, together with the\u000a      extremely high level of general public interest in human origins, which\u000a      make LJMU research of such interest and utility to the broadcasting\u000a      community.\u000a    Aiello &amp; Wheeler (1995 [2]) proposed the Expensive Tissue\u000a      Hypothesis to explain why the energetic costs of increasing brain size\u000a      during human evolution have not resulted in a correspondingly elevated\u000a      Basal Metabolic Rate (MBR). They showed that the additional costs of the\u000a      metabolically expensive brain are balanced by a corresponding reduction in\u000a      the relative size and energetic expenditure of the gut. Such a reduction\u000a      in gut size required a shift to higher diet quality, which it was\u000a      suggested initially resulted from the consumption of an increased\u000a      proportion of animal material and later the development of cooking. Larger\u000a      brain size was therefore linked to dietary change and an entire suite of\u000a      social and foraging behaviours.\u000a    Other work (Wheeler 1993, 1994; Aiello &amp; Wheeler 2003 [1,3,4])\u000a      focussed on the impact on human evolution of thermoregulatory pressures\u000a      resulting from environmental factors. Building on previous modelling\u000a      studies of the thermoregulatory significance of bipedalism and the loss of\u000a      functional body hair, Wheeler (1993 [3]) demonstrated how observed\u000a      changes in post-cranial body form further increased tolerance of high\u000a      thermal loads, and reduced drinking water requirements, in hot equatorial\u000a      environments. Wheeler (1994 [4]) quantified the extent to which\u000a      thermal stress could be ameliorated by modified activity patterns, such as\u000a      shade seeking during the hottest part of the day. This study also found\u000a      that these advantages are substantially higher if the covering of body\u000a      hair is reduced, providing further insight into the appearance and\u000a      behaviours of early hominins.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29360","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    LJMU research underpinned the following impacts:\u000a    \u000a      Informed the location, management and monitoring of four newly\u000a        Protected Areas for Forest\u000a        biodiversity in the Liang Shan region of southern Sichuan\u000a      Increased the understanding of the effects of human activities on\u000a        wildlife, creating opportunities\u000a        for changing human behaviour patterns to benefit both local people and\u000a        wildlife\u000a      Created better understanding of Chinese wildlife and conservation\u000a        locally in Sichuan and within\u000a        the UK\u000a    \u000a    LJMU Research informed the location, management and monitoring of four\u000a        newly\u000a        Protected Areas for Forest biodiversity in the Liang Shan region of\u000a        southern Sichuan\u000a    The research outputs that feed into these aims are an understanding of\u000a      population size and\u000a      distribution, habitat preferences and ecological requirements of\u000a      threatened endemic birds that have\u000a      informed location and management of protected areas [ 1, 3, 4].\u000a      Research (1997 - 1999) on\u000a      population size and distribution of the Sichuan Partridge [1,2]\u000a      ran parallel to active attempts that\u000a      were being made by the wildlife conservation division of the Sichuan\u000a      Forest Department (SFD) to\u000a      secure protection for some of the rapidly diminishing forest habitat\u000a      within the bird's range. As part\u000a      of a wider plan to protect remaining forest cover, four new nature\u000a      reserves containing the species\u000a      covering a total of 100,000ha were established by the SFD from 2000 [H,I,J].\u000a      Two of the four\u000a      supported reserves have achieved national status in the last two years and\u000a      these now benefit from\u000a      central Government funding [H,I,J]. These reserves conserve\u000a      endemic birds and mammals, such\u000a      as the Giant and Lesser pandas, and the Tibetan Macaque [H,I,J].\u000a    As a direct result of his research, Dowell founded the Sichuan Forest\u000a      Biodiversity Project as a\u000a      project of the Chester Zoo Conservation outreach programme for China in\u000a      2002 and he acted as\u000a      project coordinator until 2013. [A,B,E,H,I,J]. The project\u000a      supports four nature reserves (Heizhugou,\u000a      Ma'anshan, Laojunshan and Mamize Nature Reserves) established since 2000.\u000a      The project is in\u000a      collaboration with the Sichuan Forest Department, a Chinese Government\u000a      agency based in\u000a      Chengdu [E,H,I,J]. The overarching aims of the project are to\u000a      enhance the network of Protected\u000a      Areas for forest biodiversity (especially broadleaf forest) in the Liang\u000a      Shan region of southern\u000a      Sichuan and to engage the local Yi tribal people in their sustainable\u000a      management and\u000a      development.\u000a    Detailed ecological studies have led to new insights into the habitat\u000a      requirements of endemic bird\u000a      species providing the opportunity for research-informed conservation\u000a      action in the newly\u000a      established reserves [3,4,5]. Dowell has worked closely with\u000a      nature reserve rangers to develop\u000a      wildlife monitoring schemes based on the underpinning research. Annual\u000a      monitoring of all\u000a      Galliformes (considered to be important as indicator species) using\u000a      systematic line transect and\u000a      point count methods has been developed through intensive training and\u000a      active support for data\u000a      entry and analysis. There is now a data set going back to 2006 which is\u000a      beginning to allow the\u000a      impact of management actions to be monitored. Further monitoring of\u000a      Galliformes and mammals is\u000a      being piloted using camera traps [H,I,J].\u000a    The project has been highly successful in building capacity for\u000a      conservation in the Liang Shan\u000a      region. All four nature reserves are managed by teams of rangers derived\u000a      from the local\u000a      population, including many Yi tribal people. The project has actively\u000a      assisted them in this by\u000a      providing training in species identification, wildlife survey and\u000a      monitoring techniques, use of GIS\u000a      and other computer software to assist management, community project\u000a      management and publicity\u000a      raising [A,B,H,I,J]. Management of the project has moved from\u000a      central coordination by the Sichuan\u000a      Forest Department to local management by the nature reserves themselves,\u000a      working to a 5 year\u000a      Conservation Strategy for the Liang Shan region that was prepared by\u000a      Dowell in 2010 in\u000a      collaboration with Sichuan Forest Department and nature reserve colleagues\u000a      [E,H,I,J]. There is an\u000a      annual meeting of all senior staff from all four reserves to share\u000a      practice at which research results\u000a      are fully disseminated and there is discussion and agreement as to how\u000a      they can be used to inform\u000a      their management plans.\u000a    LJMU Research increased the understanding of the effects of human\u000a        activities on wildlife,\u000a        creating opportunities for changing human behaviour patterns to benefit\u000a        both local people\u000a        and wildlife\u000a    Since disturbance, especially during the breeding season, has been found\u000a      to affect habitat\u000a      selection and productivity in the target bird species, a key impact of our\u000a      research has led to work\u000a      with local communities to find viable alternatives to the activities that\u000a      cause disturbance. Many of\u000a      the local communities living in and around the nature reserves in the\u000a      Liang Shan are ethnic Yi tribal\u000a      people suffering from severe economic deprivation due to rural poverty and\u000a      unemployment.\u000a    One activity which causes disturbance to wildlife is the collection of\u000a      firewood from within the\u000a      protected forest reserves. This cause of disturbance has been successfully\u000a      reduced through the\u000a      establishment of biogas or fuel saving stoves. At one site, Laojunshan\u000a      Nature Reserve, installation\u000a      of biogas stoves that utilise methane gas generated from pig dung as a\u000a      fuel has been shown to\u000a      reduce wood collection by up to 95% [A,B,C,H,I,J] and to date 28\u000a      households have benefited\u000a      [H,I,J]. At Mamize Nature Reserve, the installation of enclosed\u000a      fuel saving stoves into 20\u000a      households has reduced wood collection by one third and led to\u000a      improvements in human health\u000a      due to the reduction of smoke inhalation from open fires [B,H,I,J].\u000a    A second example is the establishment of bee hives for the generation of\u000a      honey as a sustainable\u000a      alternative economic activity to the collection of forest products to sell\u000a      as a supplemental source of\u000a      income. At Heizhugou Nature Reserve, where 15 families have been provided\u000a      with hives, stock\u000a      and equipment since 2009 [H,I,J], it has been found that the\u000a      income generated from honey can be\u000a      up to one hundred times that gained from collection of wild plants with\u000a      edible or medicinal\u000a      properties [B,H,I,J].

One of the key findings of\u000a      the research has been the negative impact of human disturbance,\u000a      particularly during the breeding\u000a      season, on population density and breeding success for both species [1,2,3,4,5].\u000a      Translation of\u000a      the research into action has therefore focused on working with local\u000a      communities to find viable and\u000a      sustainable alternatives to activities such as firewood and medicinal\u000a      plant collection that cause\u000a      disturbance to wildlife.\u000a    LJMU-led research determined the species densities at optimal elevations\u000a      required by the Sichuan\u000a      Partridge, and demonstrated its reliance upon broadleaf forest habitats [1,\u000a        2, 3]. This study\u000a      demonstrated that the Sichuan Partridge had successfully colonised areas\u000a      of secondary \/\u000a      replanted forest, initially altered by logging activity [1] but\u000a      preferred older forest, both primary and\u000a      established secondary forest [3]. The Omei Shan Liocichla was\u000a      shown to prefer areas of scrub\u000a      between the broadleaf trees for nesting [4, 5]. These research\u000a      findings were important for\u000a      conservation efforts in an area where logging has seriously reduced the\u000a      availability of primary\u000a      forest and suggested a way forward in conserving these species which has\u000a      been utilised in\u000a      conservation efforts.\u000a    Studies identified the threats to the bird habitat caused by logging\u000a      activity, which had been\u000a      organised at a provincial rather than a more local county level [2].\u000a      Land clear felled by loggers was\u000a      often exploited briefly as agricultural or grazing land, although\u000a      subsequently it would be replanted\u000a      with native broadleaf species to stabilise steep slopes [2].\u000a      Logging in the area was banned in\u000a      1998 following widespread flooding, attributed in part to deforestation [3].\u000a      Bamboo shoot collection,\u000a      which is regulated but widespread, occurs seasonally (April-May) during\u000a      the Partridge breeding\u000a      period (March-June) and was also identified as a cause of disturbance\u000a      affecting conservation [2].\u000a      Sichuan Partridge and Omei Shan Liocichla were shown to prefer habitats\u000a      which were less subject\u000a      to active human disturbance [3, 4, 5]. Other cultural activities\u000a      which disturbed the breeding of\u000a      target species were identified, including the harvest of medicinal plants\u000a      and hunting [2, 4, 5].\u000a    LJMU-led research thus provided the groundwork for conservation activity\u000a      in this region by defining\u000a      the ecological requirements of the taxa studied, including preferred\u000a      habitats, breeding ecology and\u000a      ranging behaviour. Since initial population densities, particularly of the\u000a      Sichuan Partridge, were\u000a      low, environmental and human threats to breeding success were identified.\u000a      These findings were\u000a      actively used to inform conservation activities in Sichuan.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34481","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2233387","Name":"Cameroon"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    UCL-led research on chimpanzees has facilitated conservation practice\u000a      within Nigeria's 7,000 km2\u000a      Gashaka-Gumti National Park and the surrounding region by developing\u000a      enhanced infrastructure\u000a      and skills.

Supported by funding from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, GPP\u000a      began a satellite-based\u000a        vegetation mapping of the park as part of its biodiversity research.\u000a      Several park officials\u000a      were trained to interpret remote sensing imagery through GIS, and a\u000a      complete set of related soft-\u000a      and hardware was handed over to the park management in 2010 [4]. The\u000a      research project also\u000a      initiated seed programmes to improve park ranger efficiency and\u000a        motivation to patrol their areas\u000a      fully and conscientiously. Regular donations to the ranger clinic helped\u000a      to build up a sustainable\u000a      stock of drugs. From 2006-09, GPP provided gear and rations as an\u000a      incentive to guard remote\u000a      forests; this was so successful that the scheme was adopted by the\u000a      National Park Service in 2010.\u000a      A prime poaching spot was identified by the project team and further\u000a      funding obtained from\u000a      Chester Zoo to erect a permanent `rotary camp' shelter for rangers in 2010\u000a      [4].\u000a    Supporting communities and learning\u000a    As well as aiding park management and conservation efforts, hybridising\u000a      support for research and\u000a      law enforcement has also benefited those living in this remote region, as\u000a      GPP has led on the\u000a      development of several important infrastructural improvements. For\u000a      example, in 2005, the project\u000a      established an extensive radio communication system across the\u000a      park and its buffer zone. This\u000a      was facilitated by Sommer's long-standing relationship with\u000a      Julius-Berger-Nigeria (JBN), who\u000a      sponsored the installation and maintenance of the network covering 10,000\u000a      km2 across the park\u000a      and its buffer zones. In a project spanning several years, a repeater\u000a      station was erected on a\u000a      mountaintop in the park's heart and hand-held radios distributed (2005),\u000a      land rover-radios were\u000a      acquired (2008), and ranger stations fitted with solar-powered stationary\u000a      radios (2009) [5]. This not\u000a      only enabled researchers to coordinate across vast tracts of forest but,\u000a      crucially, enhanced the\u000a      capabilities of rangers to protect this unique biotope. Moreover, in a\u000a      region where messages\u000a      normally travel at walking speed and mobile phones don't work, reliable\u000a      radio coverage has\u000a      allowed notice of medical emergencies to be provided and transportation\u000a      arranged from the edge\u000a      of the forest to the nearest health facilities; locals and rangers cite\u000a      examples of victims of snake\u000a      bites and women in childbirth receiving urgent medical care during the\u000a      census period [6].\u000a    Since its inception, GPP has encouraged knowledge transfer leading to\u000a        the recruitment and\u000a        training of a new generation of park management and conservation experts\u000a      in Nigeria. Since 2008,\u000a      30 African students have received bursaries sponsored by industry and\u000a      donations and\u000a      administered through GPP. Ten later entered conservation or park\u000a      management careers, while 13\u000a      proceeded to higher education [8].\u000a    GPP also initiated German-Nigerian cooperation in the field of solar\u000a        engineering. Students of the\u000a      Oskar-von-Miller Schule, an engineering polytechnic in Kassel, Germany,\u000a      designed a sustainable\u000a      `power-island' ensuring a clean, uninterrupted electricity supply to the\u000a      research station [7].\u000a      Supported by JBN and German industries, the facility was installed in\u000a      2005, and expanded or\u000a      reset four times during 2008-2013. 11 German students have received\u000a      accreditation as solar\u000a      engineers and several Nigerian park personnel were trained in renewable\u000a      energy techniques [7].\u000a    Supporting conservation\u000a    GPP has contributed to wider conservation goals in West Africa\u000a      through the development of the\u000a      Regional Action Plan for the Conservation of the Nigeria-Cameroon\u000a        Chimpanzee (2011) [9].\u000a      Professor Sommer, twice elected member of the IUCN \/ SSC Primate\u000a      Specialist Group on Great\u000a      Apes, was a main contributor to the plan, which was endorsed by the\u000a      wildlife and environment\u000a      ministers of Cameroon and Nigeria. The plan cites Sommer's research to\u000a      show the cultural\u000a      uniqueness of this ape subspecies and to argue for urgent measures to\u000a      protect its remaining\u000a      members. Using UCL-led population mapping data, the plan declares Gashaka\u000a      an `exceptional\u000a      site', identified key threats, and recommended a five-year conservation\u000a      plan [9]. Professor\u000a      Sommer's conservation vision was always tied to the challenge of creating\u000a      sustainable long-term\u000a      support for one of West Africa's last chimpanzee havens. This plan came to\u000a      fruition in 2012, when\u000a      Chester Zoo agreed to permanently fund conservation activities through a\u000a      newly created Gashaka\u000a        Biodiversity Project (GBP), now registered as an international NGO\u000a      in Nigeria [10]. Sommer was\u000a      appointed director with oversight of research activities, and awarded the\u000a      North of England\u000a      Zoological Society's highest honour, the Gold Medal. The laudatio stated:\u000a      \"Before the project was\u000a      established, gunshots rang out daily in the very heart of the park; now,\u000a      tranquillity reigns &#8212; except\u000a      when the chimpanzees are calling....\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Volker Sommer's research focuses on behavioural ecology of non-human\u000a      primates.

A recurring theme is his\u000a      recognition that\u000a      considerable intra-specific variation in behaviour and social organisation\u000a      characterises not only\u000a      humans, but also other animals. Accordingly, Sommer's work demonstrates\u000a      the considerable\u000a      flexibility with which non-human primates cope with ecological constraints\u000a      &#8212; thus making them\u000a      suitable models for the pathways of human evolution and cultural\u000a      variation. Among non-human\u000a      animals, chimpanzees show the greatest degree of behavioural diversity,\u000a      and Sommer's research\u000a      has corroborated the view that their communities are characterised by\u000a      unique combinations of\u000a      social customs and tool-based techniques of subsistence [a], [b], [c].\u000a    In 1999, Sommer founded the Gashaka Primate Project (GPP) in Nigeria's\u000a      Gashaka-Gumti\u000a      National Park, a multi-national biodiversity research initiative that\u000a      combines field and laboratory\u000a      studies to stimulate efforts to conserve the fauna and flora of one of\u000a      West Africa's last remaining\u000a      wildernesses (www.ucl.ac.uk\/gashaka)\u000a      [d]. Sommer's fieldwork has established that the remote\u000a      Gashaka highlands hold the largest remaining population of the\u000a      Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzee\u000a      (Pan troglodytes ellioti [aka vellerosus]), constituting\u000a      perhaps 1,000 individuals [e]. This ape is the\u000a      least known and genetically most distinct &#8212; and by far the most endangered\u000a      &#8212; subspecies of\u000a      chimpanzee. Extinction would not only mean losing genetic diversity\u000a      amongst our closest living\u000a      relatives, but also cultural diversity, given specific local customs. At\u000a      most 3,500 animals remain,\u000a      largely in small pockets; foot surveys showed that all population\u000a      fragments face severe\u000a      anthropogenic pressures through illegal cattle grazing, conversion of\u000a      forest and hunting. This led\u000a      to the recognition that conservation efforts based on law enforcement and\u000a      community\u000a      development need to be incorporated into research planning.\u000a    As with other African apes, the bush-meat trade is thought to be the\u000a      biggest threat to the survival of\u000a      chimpanzees. However, assessments of the reduction of wild populations are\u000a      notoriously\u000a      unreliable since they are mostly based on indirect evidence such as market\u000a      surveys and interviews\u000a      with hunters. Sommer's team instead measured annual loss from the wild\u000a      through intake rates of\u000a      chimpanzee orphans into sanctuaries. Population loss was calculated by\u000a      relating arrivals into\u000a      sanctuaries to the proportions of infants in wild groups, hunting\u000a      strategies, and the likelihood that\u000a      captured babies make it to a sanctuary [f]. The results indicate that\u000a      hunting is far above\u000a      sustainability, and that the Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzee will become\u000a      extinct in 20-30 years, if\u000a      protection measures are not dramatically improved. Accordingly,\u000a      conservation planning and\u000a      resource deployment became an intrinsic part of GPP's research trajectory.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34929","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1252634","Name":"Bhutan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1327865","Name":"Myanmar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"932692","Name":"Lesotho"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research at UCL Anthropology has led to significant changes in how\u000a      patients are treated and led\u000a      to a culture change in psychiatry and clinical practice in Europe and the\u000a      United States. Perhaps the\u000a      greatest systemic change as a result of this research has been through\u000a      contributions to the fourth\u000a      edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or\u000a      the DSM-IV (American\u000a      Psychiatric Association 1994). This is the hegemonic psychiatric\u000a      diagnostic manual used daily by\u000a      practitioners around the world, and which determines diagnosis and health\u000a      insurance, particularly\u000a      in the USA. Contributions to this manual have enhanced practitioners'\u000a      understanding of the cultural\u000a      dimensions of psychiatric disorder.\u000a    Littlewood applied findings from his long and influential career of\u000a      research on the cultural shaping\u000a      of mental illness in the Caribbean and elsewhere (e.g. [a]) in his role as\u000a      a consultant on the DSM-\u000a      IV. This, and its 2000 revision the DSM-IV-TR, were used throughout the\u000a      impact period until\u000a      superseded by DSM-5 in May 2013. Specifically, Littlewood co-authored the\u000a      appendix describing\u000a      culture-bound psychiatric syndromes and the systematic evaluation of\u000a      cultural context, which\u000a      represents the first major recognition of anthropological findings on\u000a      cultural diversity in an edition of\u000a      the DSM (Cave 2002). This appendix was carried forward in both the\u000a      DSM-IV-TR and the new\u000a      DSM-5, thus demonstrating its ongoing use in psychiatric diagnosis [1].\u000a    A 2005 study found that 26.2% of Americans qualify for a DSM-IV-TR\u000a      diagnosis, a proportion\u000a      unlikely to have changed during the impact period, which suggests the\u000a      broad reach of this work [2].\u000a      DSM diagnoses are used by American clinicians to request reimbursement\u000a      from insurance\u000a      companies and to monitor morbidity and mortality by national agencies.\u000a      Thus, understanding\u000a      culture-bound syndromes and relating them to the appropriate DSM diagnoses\u000a      was essential to\u000a      ensure patients were diagnosed and treated correctly, their physicians\u000a      were paid, and these cases\u000a      were incorporated into national statistics during the impact census period\u000a      [3].\u000a    The research has also been disseminated into clinical practice\u000a        through training and the publication\u000a        of key texts. For example, the findings from Calabrese's clinical\u000a      ethnography at Harvard teaching\u000a      hospitals [c] were published in a book that has influenced Swiss medical\u000a      education. The book as a\u000a      whole was the subject of a 2012 training symposium at the University\u000a      Hospital of Basel, delivered\u000a      by the editors and attended by approximately 100 Swiss clinicians, who\u000a      discussed the book's\u000a      findings and interacted with authors. The relevance of this symposium to\u000a      clinical practice is\u000a      demonstrated by the fact that attendees received continuing medical\u000a      education credits [4].\u000a      Similarly, Calabrese's monograph based on his Native American research [b]\u000a      is used to train\u000a      clinicians and medical researchers at Harvard Medical School [5].\u000a    Clinical ethnography adds an important perspective to clinical practice\u000a      which was previously\u000a      missing. The impact of the work of Littlewood and Calabrese on the\u000a      clinical disciplines is apparent\u000a      in citations of their work in medical journals that clinicians must read\u000a      to stay current in their fields\u000a      and that typically do not cite anthropology. For example, [a] has been\u000a      cited in the International\u000a        Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice (Mosotho, et al. 2008),\u000a      the Journal of Marital and Family\u000a        Therapy (Dow and Woolley 2011), and the Journal of Social Work\u000a        Practice (Gray, et al. 2010), to\u000a      name a few references in journals representing three separate clinical\u000a      disciplines [6].\u000a    The provision of robust psychiatric care is an essential aspect of\u000a      delivering Bhutan's widely\u000a      publicised efforts to define and improve Gross National Happiness (GNH).\u000a      Yet a 2012 WHO report\u000a      found there were only two psychiatrists serving the country's entire\u000a      population of 672,000.[7] The\u000a      mental health system is dramatically under-resourced and resistance to\u000a      psychiatric care derives\u000a      both from stigma and from traditional understandings of illness in terms\u000a      of spirit possession, soul\u000a      loss, or angry local deities, necessitating a culturally competent\u000a      approach. Calabrese's action\u000a      research has been instrumental in building a foundation for\u000a        anthropologically-informed psychiatric\u000a        services in Bhutan, and thus has contributed to the country's\u000a      efforts to improve GNH.\u000a    Applying insights from his research on culture and mental illness [b, c],\u000a      Calabrese positively\u000a      impacted psychiatric services in Bhutan through the delivery of\u000a      anthropologically informed training\u000a      on-site daily to over a dozen psychiatric staff members in Bhutan during\u000a      three annual summer field\u000a      trips in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and through ethnographic description of the\u000a      lives of Bhutanese\u000a      people with mental illness [d].\u000a    A British Academy International Partnership Grant allowed Calabrese to\u000a      bring Bhutan's Chief\u000a      Psychiatrist and collaborator, Chencho Dorji, to UCL during April 2013 to\u000a      meet British medical\u000a      anthropologists and psychiatrists and learn about the latest developments\u000a      in these fields. As a\u000a      result, in April 2013, Calabrese signed a Memorandum of Academic\u000a      Cooperation with the newly\u000a      established University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) to develop\u000a      curricula in Medical\u000a      Anthropology\/Clinical Ethnography and Mental Health for medical students\u000a      and allied health\u000a      professionals in Bhutan [8]. Training began in July 2013, with\u000a      presentations delivered by Calabrese\u000a      to approximately 30 staff of the new university, including the directors\u000a      of constituent institutes such\u000a      as the Royal Institute of Health Sciences. Calabrese was appointed\u000a      Visiting Lecturer, not only to\u000a      create programmes in Medical Anthropology, but also to help orient the\u000a      university toward a more\u000a      biopsychosocial and humanistic orientation generally. Calabrese is thus\u000a      integrating these fields\u000a      firmly into Bhutan's nascent system of medical education.\u000a    An important aspect of Calabrese's work is direct public engagement and\u000a      use of local media to\u000a      inform the Bhutanese population about the nature of severe mental\u000a      illnesses and what forms of\u000a      treatment may help. Calabrese has been interviewed on Bhutanese radio, for\u000a      example, an\u000a      interview on 6 August 2012 on Radio Valley 99.9, the country's second\u000a      private radio station which\u000a      covers the capital Thimphu [9]. He was also interviewed by Bhutanese\u000a      newspapers and has given\u000a      public lectures at the National Referral Hospital and the Centre for\u000a      Bhutan Studies to groups that\u000a      included traditional and modern doctors and their students, hospital\u000a      staff, and Bhutanese scholars.\u000a      Calabrese has also networked with Bhutanese political and educational\u000a      leaders around issues of\u000a      mental illness.\u000a    When it hit the impoverished coastal areas of Myanmar in 2008, Cyclone\u000a      Nargis killed 150,000 and\u000a      left up to one million homeless. Thanks to David Napier's research for his\u000a      Lancet article (which,\u000a      though published later, informed his Nargis work) and prior field research\u000a      in Myanmar, he was\u000a      contracted to create the first fully integrated qualitative-quantitative\u000a      method for assessing\u000a      vulnerability in a disaster rapid-assessment tool, and to train 18 Burmese\u000a      to carry out work with the\u000a      consent of the military dictatorship that had driven away most\u000a      international NGOs at the time.\u000a      Napier's assessment tool abandoned existing lengthy questionnaire\u000a      schedules in favour of rapid\u000a      identification techniques developed in earlier research and adapted to the\u000a      fast-changing\u000a      circumstances immediately after the cyclone.\u000a    Drawing on his ongoing research on health effects of climatic events,\u000a      Napier investigated the most\u000a      efficient methods of rapid disaster assessment. The UN stated that fully\u000a      integrated quantitative and\u000a      qualitative vulnerability assessments had been attempted \"but never in a\u000a      disaster and post-disaster\u000a      relief context due to the significant logistic and organisational\u000a      requirements\" (p. 96 in [10]). Napier's\u000a      report to the UN and recommendations on the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis\u000a      were based on a\u000a      quantitative survey that involved over 13,000 people and a qualitative\u000a      vulnerability study involving\u000a      349 in-depth interviews with survivors, which focused on health and other\u000a      risks. Napier focused on\u000a      vulnerable women and children and was able to develop immediately\u000a        responsive identifications of\u000a        where assistance should be directed by the Tripartite Core Group\u000a      (comprising the Government of\u000a      Myanmar, ASEAN and the UN). The technique was subsequently adopted for\u000a      demonstration to\u000a      other aid workers and organisations seeking to enhance the efficiency of\u000a      their own interventions at\u000a      the UN conference on Cyclone Nargis held in Bangkok later that year. This\u000a      novel disaster\u000a      assessment technique has subsequently been trialed in a number of\u000a      settings.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Clinical ethnography research at UCL has made significant contributions\u000a      to clinical practice and\u000a      diagnosis internationally.

Clinical Ethnography\u000a      deploys ethnography not\u000a      simply as an anthropological method in pursuit of anthropological data but\u000a      with the additional\u000a      intent, and result, of improving clinical outcomes. This interdisciplinary\u000a      approach thus bridges\u000a      anthropology and health sciences, reaching beyond the clinic to create\u000a      socially contextualised\u000a      clinical understanding.\u000a    Roland Littlewood (Professor of Anthropology since 1994) established the\u000a      foundations of Clinical\u000a      Ethnography through a number of key research projects which have\u000a      sensitised numerous clinical\u000a      practitioners to questions of cultural specificity. Internationally\u000a      recognised for his research on the\u000a      relationship between colonialism, racism and psychiatric theory, his\u000a      findings have illuminated the\u000a      social shaping of illness and diagnosis[a].\u000a    Joseph Calabrese (Teaching Fellow at UCL 2008-2009; Lecturer since 2011)\u000a      has used his dual\u000a      training in anthropology and clinical psychology in research projects with\u000a      Native Americans, at\u000a      Harvard teaching hospitals, and in Bhutan to explore the relationship\u000a      between culture and mental\u000a      health. Calabrese (2013) described a postcolonial healing movement which\u000a      was threatened with\u000a      criminalisation for its ritual use of the psychoactive peyote cactus [b].\u000a      He documented healing\u000a      experiences and reports by clinicians that this healing ritual was more\u000a      effective against alcoholism\u000a      than standard psychological approaches. While initial fieldwork for this\u000a      project was conducted\u000a      before joining UCL, the analysis, research synthesis and actual drafting\u000a      was completed at UCL.\u000a      Calabrese's research on Harvard teaching hospitals revealed that cultural\u000a      differences between\u000a      clinicians and patients were not as significant a barrier to care as the\u000a      mismatch between patients'\u000a      need for a traditional doctor\/patient relationship and the realities of\u000a      the impersonal, bureaucratic\u000a      culture of modern medical care [c]. This fieldwork took place in 2008,\u000a      with data analysis carried out\u000a      whilst at UCL. Subsequent research in Bhutan, beginning 2011, investigates\u000a      local understandings\u000a      of mental illness and treatment by embedding as a local clinician, which\u000a      allows deep participant\u000a      observation of clinical cases and local practice. Findings illuminate the\u000a      lives of Bhutanese\u000a      psychiatric patients, the effectiveness of modern psychiatric treatments\u000a      in this context, and the role\u000a      of ritual healing for less severe illnesses [d].\u000a    Based on his field research in Myanmar, and on then-ongoing research for\u000a      the Lancet Commission\u000a      (later published as [e]), David Napier (Professor at UCL since 2007)\u000a      pioneered new ethnographic\u000a      methods of disaster assessment in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis in 2008.\u000a      He demonstrated that\u000a      qualitative and quantitative data could be fully integrated in a disaster\u000a      setting, tying individual case\u000a      studies to large data sets that direct the flow of aid resources both\u000a      immediately following a natural\u000a      disaster, and during periods of reconstruction [f]. Subsequently, as the\u000a      member with expertise in\u000a      culture and health of a 2009 UCL Lancet commission on \"Managing the Health\u000a      Effects of Climate\u000a      Change\", he and his team produced a list of recommendations on (1) disease\u000a      and mortality; (2)\u000a      food; (3) water and sanitation; (4) shelter and human settlements; (5)\u000a      extreme events; and (6)\u000a      population and migration [e].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35122","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The MyStreet project has provided a ground-breaking platform to\u000a        promote ethnographic film of everyday life for filmmakers. The reach\u000a      of this impact is demonstrated by the visitors to the MyStreet website and\u000a      the Open Cities festival. The website was designed and supervised by\u000a      Stewart to provide a permanent forum where such work can be advertised and\u000a      seen. It went live in 2011, and by 31 July 2013, the MyStreet website had\u000a      been visited 21,708 times by 11,635 visitors; with an average dwell time\u000a      of over 4 minutes [1]. The reach was further enhanced by making\u000a      films available on YouTube and Vimeo [2] and for embedding on third-party\u000a      websites, with both local and national audiences, such as We Are\u000a        Camden and the Independent.\u000a    A second, live, platform for exposure was through Open City Docs Fest, a\u000a      festival held annually at UCL in London in June 2011-June 2013, with\u000a      audiences growing from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 over the years [3]. The ten\u000a      best MyStreet films were screened each year, at a total of 21 screenings\u000a      annually. In 2011 alone, over 3,000 people saw a MyStreet film: in\u000a      dedicated MyStreet screenings; in shorts screened before main features and\u000a      in special pop-up boxes ([3] p. 3 in the 2011 report). The best MyStreet\u000a      films were judged and a prize presented by an international jury of\u000a      acclaimed practitioners who also awarded the Open City Grand Jury Prize &#8212;\u000a      a conscious move to promote these films to the top of the festival's\u000a      agenda and facilitating the development of a self-sustaining social film\u000a      community [4, p. 4]. Over the years, the festival received substantial\u000a      notices as well as appreciative critical reviews that engaged directly\u000a      with the research. Indicative examples are [5]:\u000a    - Global: CNN: `Why we are all digital anthropologists now' (29\u000a      May 2013) (62m monthly visitors from around the world in 2012):\u000a      `Anthropology as the `science of humanity' has broadened, and the idea of\u000a      the anthropologist has evolved. Like with many professions, the baton has\u000a      passed from trained individuals to you, to me, to a big wide world.'\u000a    - National: The Independent. `My Street Films: The Lea Valley\u000a      kids' (26\/5\/11).\u000a    - Local: The Evening Standard: `We're going to shoot film about\u000a      your homeless for Afghan TV' (17\/6\/11).\u000a    In Spring 2013 the Community Channel screened 8 of the MyStreet films on\u000a      14 occasions between March and July with a total of 14,000 viewers on the\u000a      occasions audiences were monitored [6]. These follow-up projects fostered\u000a      sustained impacts upon filmmakers: \"it was the confidence thing and the\u000a      feeling worthy of Community Channel [...]. Taking you on a little bit\u000a      further than just that day before\" [4 p.2].\u000a    The significance of these linked channels are demonstrated by the\u000a      sustainable partnerships formed with private organisations seeking\u000a      to promote film as a tool of research and the importance of voices of\u000a      marginalised individuals. For example, in 2012 Arup Phase 2 (a gallery\u000a      space in the world-leading engineering company in Fitzrovia, London)\u000a      presented a rotating selection of MyStreet films for 22 weeks across the\u000a      summer in a bespoke exhibition box. As the head of exhibitions later said,\u000a      \"the screenings led Arup staff and visitors who are involved in planning\u000a      the built environment to engage with different perspectives on modern\u000a      urban life that they rarely get to hear or experience at first hand. The\u000a      MyStreet initiative triggered discussions about several projects that Arup\u000a      is involved in, ranging from the Olympics to Kings Cross as well as\u000a      feeding into the research about the environmental and social impact of\u000a      High Speed 2\". Arup estimated that about twenty thousand visitors viewed\u000a      films at this exhibition [7].\u000a    The process of research &#8212; which includes training and providing platforms\u000a      for filmmakers &#8212; is a participatory one, and has had significant impacts\u000a      on the young people who took part, equipping them to question their\u000a      environment [4, p. 4]. As a focus group exercise for filmmakers and\u000a      teachers conducted in 2013 showed, at its most fundamental level, the\u000a      MyStreet research project has engaged both aspiring and experienced\u000a        filmmakers with ethnographic ideas, encouraging them to reflect on their\u000a        own work in this light [4, see p. 1, 4, 8].\u000a    Through MyStreet's ancillary training programme, DocinaDay (DiaD), the\u000a      understanding of film as a research tool has been widened amongst\u000a      filmmakers, as has their technical ability. In its first year, MyStreet\u000a      worked with Open Cinema to make films with London's homeless and then\u000a      screened the resulting films at Open City 2011 alongside Penny Woolcock's\u000a      award winning film, On the Streets. Homeless filmmakers, young\u000a      professionals, students and professional documentarists mingled at UCL in\u000a      an embodiment of DiaD's democratising agenda. Here the online and offline\u000a      components of the MyStreet platform created a space to bring together\u000a      different communities of people, dissolving the producer\/ consumer\u000a      distinction. As noted by one filmmaker, MyStreet \"connects you to a\u000a      community that is also offline, that you can actually have access to\u000a      through the festival\" [4, p.4].\u000a    Between 2011 and 2013, 89 DiaD workshops were held around London, with\u000a      350 participants [8]. All of the schools and community groups were chosen\u000a      for their low university application rate (and high indices of social\u000a      deprivation), and five films were made in Pupil Referral Units for\u000a      excluded children [8]. This work &#8212; which mostly took place in schools and\u000a      youth centres &#8212; has led both to increased confidence [4, p. 9] and\u000a      impacted upon the students by providing them with their first opportunity\u000a      to create a permanent record of their vision of their place in the school\u000a      . It also led to increased applications to creative courses following the\u000a      production of four DiaD films [4, p. 6]. DiaD brought new ideas into the\u000a      school, \"things that they hadn't necessarily discussed before but led on\u000a      from being exposed to different sorts of creative arts [...]. It made them\u000a      think about what was out there for them and different opportunities were\u000a      available\" [4, p. 6]. The films produced have since been integrated into\u000a      the curriculum of the schools concerned [9, p. 8-9]. Underprivileged\u000a      secondary school children, youth and local community groups in London have\u000a      learnt to tackle the issues and stories that are important to them and to\u000a      explore the `mysteries that reside in the humblest things' [4, p. 8].\u000a    To increase impact upon empowerment of the citizen filmmakers many of\u000a      their films were selected for screening at Camden Council funded\u000a      screenings at Open City Docs Fest in 2011 and 2012, with over 80 in\u000a      attendance on each occasion [3]. As a teacher at the Ark Academy in\u000a      Wembley explained, making the films had positive effects for social\u000a      inclusion through the impact on their understanding of cultural diversity\u000a      [4, p. 8].\u000a    Participating in DiaD increased the ability of students to work with\u000a      professionals from beyond their school: \"it was about not just\u000a      communicating with their peers but with people who they hadn't even met\u000a      before and a lot of the students would find that difficult usually but\u000a      because I think it was something creative and something they were\u000a      interested in and wanted to be involved in it allowed them to communicate\u000a      much more effectively\" [4, p. 7, 9]. In line with its democratising agenda\u000a      the programme strengthened students' abilities to \"express their views\" on\u000a      their everyday lives and, uneditorialised, \"share their stories and their\u000a      emotions\" [4, p. 6]. Some students `were empowered to ask questions that\u000a      they would not normally dare to put. One group, for whom the police are\u000a      not a reassuring presence, were able to spend the morning filming in a\u000a      police car, talking with the officers' [4, p. 8]. In Somerstown, London,\u000a      new film projects were launched on the back of the DiaD experience [4, pp.\u000a      8-9, 11] [8]. Inspired by MyStreet, a filmmaker based at Central St\u000a      Martins launched a visual ethnography of the Kings Cross area, using Mass\u000a      Observation techniques to commission three films on the theme of\u000a      gentrification, and playing them at installations onsite [9]. One teacher\u000a      explained that staff, too, were influenced to be \"more open and seek out\u000a      types of projects that we knew the [students] would really enjoy\" after\u000a      seeing the \"passion\" of the students for filmmaking [4, p. 7].\u000a    MyStreet's promotion of a collaborative, visual research agenda through a\u000a      Web 2.0 environment has inspired others to launch similar projects, inspiring\u000a        new forms of cultural expression internationally. In June 2013, work\u000a      on a clone site in Czech was begun by One World Prague, a human rights\u000a      documentary film festival who signed a contract with Open City Docs to\u000a      launch MyStreet Prague in 2014 [10]. As the director of One World Prague\u000a      film festival said: \"The focus on the immediate surroundings that\u000a      encompasses urban, historical and social science aspects along with\u000a      educational elements in the field of film is inspiring. It offers an ideal\u000a      connection of the real and the Internet world that is not reduced to the\u000a      creation of an artificial reality but builds a specific community of\u000a      people who actively relate to their immediate surroundings' [10].\u000a    Similarly, the Afghanistan-based media training and development\u000a      organisation, Afghan Voices, was inspired to engage their students with\u000a      ethnographic ideas, creating 8 films by young Afghan students researching\u000a      aspects of daily life in cities around their country. As covered in the Evening\u000a        Standard [5], four of these filmmakers came to London in 2011 to\u000a      present their films at Open City.\u000a    Through these interrelated activities &#8212; MyStreet, DocinaDay and Open City\u000a      &#8212; Stewart's research facilitated a new form of digital, collaborative\u000a      anthropology and laid the foundations for a changed relationship between\u000a      `researchers' inside and outside the walls of the conventional university.\u000a    The contribution this research makes is demonstrated by the words of two\u000a      major filmmakers who served on the first MyStreet jury panel in 2011.\u000a      Stephen Daldry (The Hours, Billy Elliot) said, \"As street\u000a      by street in the country a MyStreet film is made, we are learning who we\u000a      are\", while Roger Mitchell (Notting Hill, Enduring Love) added:\u000a      \"... the opposite of Google Earth, MyStreet sees ourselves from the ground\u000a      up, making a modern, urban Domesday Book which we can all help create and\u000a      dip into.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The MyStreet project explores a new collaborative anthropology by\u000a      training and facilitating filmmakers in in using techniques some of which\u000a      were inspired by study of Mass Observation.

MyStreet was\u000a      developed at UCL Anthropology, a department with a longstanding focus on\u000a      the use of the visual as a research process. In recent years, for\u000a      instance, Victor Buchli collaborated with the UCL Bartlett Faculty of the\u000a      Built Environment, using film to investigate Adaptable Suburbs, and\u000a      Christopher Pinney has researched the use of video as an agent in\u000a      political self-representation. MyStreet, which uses film to inform\u000a      ethnography and ethnography to inform film grew out of this research\u000a      culture.\u000a    The specific direction of MyStreet was born from three of Stewart's\u000a      ongoing research interests. The first is his ethnographic research among\u000a      east European Roma (1984-present). An enduring concern in this was the\u000a      ability of ethnography to capture the distinctive life-worlds of\u000a      hyper-marginalised communities and individuals (not to be seen as failed\u000a      versions of mainstream culture) [d]. Equally salient was the Roma use of\u000a      visual social clues, i.e. an intuitive practice of grasping fluid visual\u000a      forms which can be seen as a `minor' venatic practice of the\u000a      hyper-marginalised [c].\u000a    The second is Stewart's own `venatic' tracing of clues in the historical\u000a      archive within his research on Roma under the Nazis inspired by Carlo\u000a      Ginzburg's approach, focusing on the use of individual case-histories to\u000a      explore macro-social trends. This led him to recognise the power of the\u000a      case study approach that is also fundamental to ethnographic film [e]. The\u000a      convergence of his written, historical ethnography with established film\u000a      practice suggested the anthropological potential of a new form of\u000a      ethnographic film [a]. The final strand was his own work in film since\u000a      1988 which led him to develop the MyStreet model of collaborative\u000a      filmmaking [d, a].\u000a    In line with its Mass Observation inspiration, MyStreet laid the\u000a      foundations for a distributed, collaborative, shared `science of\u000a      ourselves', aiming to dissolve the researcher\/ researched distinction.\u000a      Whereas conventional ethnography involves a filtering and selection of\u000a      voices by the anthropologist, MyStreet facilitates a multi-authored\u000a      polyphony of multiple and diverse perspectives [a]. In this 2013\u000a      publication, Stewart describes how vernacular filmmaking helps dissolve\u000a      the producer\/ consumer boundary through an explicit rejection of the\u000a      traditional power relations of broadcast documentary. He draws on the Mass\u000a      Observation movement &#8212; a methodology that itself tried to harness the new\u000a      media of its time in an attempt to democratise ethnography and to\u000a      re-enchant the study of the `everyday' [a].\u000a    Stewart's research into marginality has thus led him to expand the\u000a      traditional approach of ethnographic film not only by including people who\u000a      were not traditionally part of the ethnographic film conversation, but by\u000a      putting the theoretical and practical tools of ethnography into the hands\u000a      of the participants themselves [d, a]. MyStreet conceptualises how\u000a      practices of `indigenous media' might enable a revival of the democratic\u000a      anthropology of Mass Observation. The research team has formed\u000a      relationships with over 300 filmmakers, inspiring them to use ethnographic\u000a      investigations of everyday British life. Through the annual competition, a\u000a      website, and screenings these film-research projects create\u000a      ethnographically informed conversations. A total of 315 independent films\u000a      now exist on the MyStreet living archive [b]. The project also facilitates\u000a      the use of film as an ethnographic tool for people who are normally the\u000a      objects of social scientific study, through DocinaDay workshops in schools\u000a      and communities. Participants generate their own research-film outputs, of\u000a      which 89 are viewable on the MyStreet website.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35297","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2088628","Name":"Papua New Guinea"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This case-study focuses on EU-Pacific international relations and\u000a      development policy, and provides evidence that as a result of Crook's `own\u000a      research on knowledge practices and method for knowledge-exchanges in a\u000a      Europe-Pacific context' we now have `an enhanced effectiveness to the EU's\u000a      external actions in the Pacific' [1].\u000a    In terms of a widely applicable method for knowledge-exchange, Crook's\u000a      research suggests that there is both necessity and real productive virtue\u000a      in respecting and maintaining differentiation, and in working with\u000a      incommensurability rather than against it: `the acknowledgment and\u000a      creation of gaps between the EU officials, the European researchers, and\u000a      the Pacific researchers involved in ECOPAS project, i.e. Dr. Crook's\u000a      concept of knowledge transfer, has been instrumental in bringing a\u000a      critical mass for the process to be launched' [2].\u000a    Since joining St Andrews, Crook's development of the `Pacific\u000a      Connections' method for knowledge-exchanges has been trialled, put into\u000a      practice and impacted upon different kinds of audiences - mining\u000a        industry, general public, UK and EU international policy &#8212; and met\u000a      with different receptions, and led to diverse forms of impact evidence.\u000a    Whilst Crook's research insights have, since 1997, been communicated to\u000a      the mining industry (in person, and through publications 2004,\u000a      2007b, 2007c), the internal corporate impact of research perceived as a\u000a      reputational challenge to change behaviour, or as an adversarial critique,\u000a      is necessarily harder to evidence than where a more positive user-friendly\u000a      relation exists: in 1997 Ok Tedi managers told Crook to disappear, kicked\u000a      him out of town in 2001 and withdrew cooperation in 2004; in 2010 Crook\u000a      made two presentations to the International Council on Mining and Metals &#8212;\u000a      evidence of their internal impact took the form of the ICMM's subsequent\u000a      disengagement.\u000a    In 2010, Crook organized and participated in a series of `Pacific\u000a      Connections' public events [6] to coincide with his organization\u000a      of ESfO2010, the 8th conference of the European Society for\u000a      Oceanists (which he chaired, 2008-10) [7]. These public events\u000a      included `Double Visions', an exhibition of contemporary PNG art\u000a      (co-organized with Fife Contemporary Arts and Crafts, and shown in\u000a      Kirkaldy and St Andrews), and a public talk Crook gave in Kirkcaldy about\u000a      the exhibition which drew on the `double visions' required to comprehend\u000a      Melanesian knowledge-practices; `Lost Land of the Volcano' which engaged\u000a      the BBC producer and a presenter of the TV series and which questioned the\u000a      inter-relation between indigenous knowledge and biodiversity; and `Avatar'\u000a      which was designed around the participation of the movie's anthropological\u000a      consultant, and involved an anthropologist employed by a PNG mine, a PNG\u000a      researcher and activist, and Global Witness to discuss the commodity\u000a      chains and `resource wars' linking the UK and PNG.\u000a    In a UK international policy context, Crook was invited by the\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office to speak at a high level roundtable\u000a      involving UK Ministers and Pacific Ambassadors, invited by the\u000a      Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to speak alongside the Papua New\u000a      Guinea High Commissioner in Westminster Hall on the Milennium Development\u000a      Goals [`your insight into social relationships in [PNG] society'... were\u000a      `fascinating', `we received wonderful feedback' 3], and to provide\u000a      a video film to kick-off FCO Minister Swire's debate with University of\u000a      Papua New Guinea students in Apr 2013 [8].\u000a    However, the central focus of this impact case-study is on the European\u000a        Union and highlights the context of a large bureaucracy in which\u000a      policy-making is geared to a hierarchy of political decisions and research\u000a      evidence. Impacts are made evident in the responses of research users as a\u000a      relationship of trust is built up and is manifested by step-wise requests\u000a      for subsequent inputs into new contexts and by remarks over previous\u000a      inputs.\u000a    In early 2010, the EU EEAS Pacific Division, recognized that the research\u000a      it drew upon mainly originated beyond Europe, and when Crook sent details\u000a      of his research and of the ESfO2010 conference and invited them to attend,\u000a      EEAS phoned Crook to discuss the thinking behind the conference rubric:\u000a      this derived directly from Crook's Min research [2007a, 2007b]. EEAS and\u000a      DG-RTD sent delegates who addressed the opening plenary [7], and\u000a      asked Crook to nominate participants for a meeting in St Andrews with\u000a      European research leaders, and then again to give a keynote talk, and to\u000a      nominate speakers and delegates who would be offered EU-funding for a\u000a      large workshop in Brussels [9]. At this workshop, the EU announced\u000a      that the ESfO2010 conference had leveraged their policy aim for a research\u000a      network and policy interface, and the EEAS Head of Pacific Division\u000a      publicly thanked Crook for demonstrating a method for the\u000a      knowledge-exchange relations that they could work with, saying it was\u000a      `clearly going to be very important and a really key part of making the\u000a      proposed network and policy interface a success' [1]. Additional\u000a      evidence of impact at the workshop is that EEAS and DG-RES publically\u000a      called for St Andrews to play a lead role in responding to their FP7\u000a      funding call. This resulted in the ECOPAS consortium with Crook as a point\u000a      of contact for DG-RTD and EEAS which expressed a hope that Crook would be\u000a      involved in the knowledge-exchange policy interface with several EU and EC\u000a      units with a Pacific remit.\u000a    EEAS also invited Crook to assist them in organizing a High Level Panel\u000a      focused on the Pacific at the European Development Days event in Warsaw\u000a      (Dec, 2011) and were so taken with Crook's `Pacific Connections' method\u000a      (which won a competitive slot at EDD2011) to create a dialogue between EU\u000a      attempts to connect development ideas to Pacific ways, and Pacific\u000a      attempts to connect to development initiatives, that they asked to merge\u000a      this HLP with their own. `Pacific Connections' responded to EEAS' request\u000a      for recommendations to the EU as it seeks to renew its development\u000a      partnership with the Pacific. The EC's Commissioner for Development asked\u000a      Crook to draft his introductory remarks, and of his own accord praised the\u000a      research linkages between different scales.

The deputy head (Pacific, EEAS) wrote to Crook thanking\u000a      him for his work and results in delivering the EDD event, which he\u000a      described as `excellent', and as indication of the impact on EEAS policy\u000a      thinking, asked Crook to provide advice on how policy related to the\u000a      Pacific (which is covered by the Cotonou Agreement with the ACP regions),\u000a      might be accommodated by the EC's internal re-organization (in 2011) which\u000a      has separated the Pacific from other ACP regions and re-aligned it in with\u000a      Asia.\u000a    ECOPAS was awarded FP7 funding and, since the project started in December\u000a      2012, Crook has been engaged in close cooperation with EEAS and\u000a      knowledge-exchange with various EC units, has chaired a series of Pacific\u000a      Connections events in Brussels (at the European Parliament and EEAS), and\u000a      in St Andrews on gender inequality and on sustainable development attended\u000a      by EEAS [2]. For example, in May 2013, two roundtables held in\u000a      EEAS focused on sustainable development and gender issues attracted 48\u000a      participants from 24 units and organizations across and beyond the EC,\u000a      including four Pacific ambassadors and the Director General of the\u000a      Secretariat of the Pacific Community: `the success of such an event is\u000a      normally very difficult to ensure', `Dr Tony Crook...managed to transfer\u000a      knowledge and inform policy stakeholders successfully, creating moreover\u000a      significant and sustainable links' and `All these successes were down to\u000a      the design of the format based on the method for knowledge exchange\u000a      designed by Dr Tony Crook' [4].\u000a    Each of these events have involved diplomats, policy-makers and regional\u000a      organizations from the Pacific who have endorsed the Pacific Connections\u000a      approach, and encouraged and commended the EU for making their external\u000a      actions more effective in this manner. Indeed, the language of `Pacific\u000a      Connections' has been adopted by an internal EU review, and now provides\u000a      the terms in which European external actions are conceived. Crook's\u000a      research insights into, and method based upon, Melanesian\u000a      knowledge-exchange have been `instrumental' [5] in making EU\u000a      external actions in the Pacific more effective.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Tony Crook's research on knowledge-practices solved a long-standing\u000a      theoretical problem in Papua New Guinea (PNG).

Since joining St Andrews,\u000a      Crook's innovative solution to the Min Problem was recognized in winning\u000a      the British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship Monograph Competition (2007a).\u000a    Crook's research argues that the Min Problem was of Anthropology's own\u000a      making: what is at stake for the Min is not the content or meaning of\u000a      knowledge, but rather the differentiated personal capacities and social\u000a      positions that their knowledge-exchange relations create (2009). Pacific\u000a      knowledge-exchanges focus on defining and maintaining social positions and\u000a      hierarchies &#8212; and so previous analytical attempts to meaningfully\u000a      reconcile different and incomplete pieces of some knowledge puzzle missed\u000a      the point entirely. A key finding and lesson here is that Pacific\u000a      epistemologies take the differentiation and incommensurability of knowers\u000a      and what they know for granted, and work by accommodating diverse\u000a      positions rather than attempting to homogenise them and thus offend and\u000a      collapse the very relations through which knowedge is made effective.\u000a    Crook's research has involved fieldwork with three Min groups in the\u000a      context of villages and a mining township - as an undergraduate in 1990,\u000a      postgraduate in 1994-1996, and postdoctorate in 1997, 1999, 2000-1. But\u000a      his solution to the Min problem was only finalized since joining St\u000a      Andrews in 2003 and confirmed during fieldwork in 2004 and 2006-7 and\u000a      published as a monograph in 2007 as Anthropological Knowledge, Secrecy\u000a        and Bolivip, Papua New Guinea: Exchanging Skin (British Academy\/OUP\u000a      2007a). Subsequently, Crook's research has examined the similarly profound\u000a      misunderstandings of the Min lifeworld evident in the mis-management of\u000a      the social and cultural impacts of the Ok Tedi mine (2004, 2007b, 2007c).\u000a    Crook's research focuses on the vernacular terms of indigenous\u000a      epistemology&#8212;in which 'knowledge' (k&#225;l) is a water-like substance\u000a      in the skin (kal) that circulates between people, plants and food\u000a      gardens&#8212;and the knowledge exchanges that take place both outwith and\u000a      during male initiation ritual, and amongst both men and women. Min\u000a      knowledge practices take incommensurability, asymmetry and incomprehension\u000a      for granted: figured as the difference between the crown of a tree&#8212;where\u000a      multiple branches, twigs and leaves exhibit differentiation and movement\u000a      which is likened to confusion&#8212;and the base of a tree where the different\u000a      `examples' (kukup) come together, aligned in straightness and\u000a      stillness. By conceiving of the positions in knowledge in this way, and by\u000a      treating knowledge exchange as the skin of one person being laid over the\u000a      skin of another person, Min epistemology assumes that positions in\u000a      knowledge are inside- out to each other.\u000a    In this light, the problem of Euro-American encounters with Pacific\u000a      lifeworlds is not simply a matter of cultural or even epistemological\u000a      difference&#8212;but rather the problem of assuming that knowledge exchange and\u000a      cross-cultural understanding can and should overcome issues of\u000a      incommensurability, when in the Pacific actively respecting and\u000a        creating this is the very means to knowing another's position and\u000a      thereby making knowledge for oneself and making it effective.\u000a    In demonstrating his solution to the Min problem, Crook borrowed his\u000a      ethnographic method of setting up an exchange between different knowledges\u000a      from the Min peoples who taught him the lesson&#8212;and has since trialled and\u000a      developed a practical method for knowledge-exchange that acknowledges the\u000a      value of respecting and creating differentiation as the very relational\u000a      basis for meaningful dialogue with Pacific peoples.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35298","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Bunn's research, described in section 2, has contributed to (1) enhanced\u000d\u000a      cultural understanding\u000d\u000a      across disciplines and international boundaries, (2) enhanced creativity\u000d\u000a      and society at a micro-level,\u000d\u000a      (3) economic Impact as a result of knowledge exchange between Kyrgyz and\u000d\u000a      British\u000d\u000a      partners, and (4) cultural preservation on the world stage through a\u000d\u000a      consistent practice of\u000d\u000a      knowledge exchange between her own research findings and different domains\u000d\u000a      of textile\u000d\u000a      knowledge and expertise, linking international practitioners, museums, art\u000d\u000a      galleries and agencies.\u000d\u000a      Long-term work as an academic partner with Kyrgyz organization\u000d\u000a      CACSA\/CACSARC, researching\u000d\u000a      local knowledge, working with local organizations and writing, has\u000d\u000a      encouraged local practitioners in\u000d\u000a      developing the visibility of felt production at an international level.\u000d\u000a      Exhibitions and UK educational\u000d\u000a      activities have impacted on British public and UK craft practitioners and\u000d\u000a      links have been\u000d\u000a      established between UK and Central Asia textile artists and institutions\u000d\u000a      Financial benefit has been\u000d\u000a      achieved for visiting artists which will impact on their local\u000d\u000a      communities.

This formed her recent volume\u000d\u000a      Nomadic Felt (2010),\u000d\u000a      published in the British Museum Press academic series Artistic Traditions\u000d\u000a      in World Cultures,\u000d\u000a      Bunn's underpinning research, specifically Nomadic Felts, which as\u000d\u000a      both a scholarly and publicly\u000d\u000a      accessible volume, has brought knowledge of this subject to increasingly\u000d\u000a      wide audiences\u000d\u000a      (including anthropology, history, textiles and general interest) in the\u000d\u000a      UK, the USA and across the\u000d\u000a      world. From the Kyrgyz perspective it both positioned their work along\u000d\u000a      other world felt traditions\u000d\u000a      and profiled it [S1]. The book sold 1,161 copies in the first 18 months of\u000d\u000a      publication [S5] and has\u000d\u000a      been favourably reviewed in diverse journals from the Textile Society of\u000d\u000a      America to the Times\u000d\u000a      Literary Supplement. Bunn's experience as a curator, practitioner and\u000d\u000a      workshop leader (skills built\u000d\u000a      up during her research), have led to the interactive and collaborative\u000d\u000a      aspects of her exhibition,\u000d\u000a      symposium and workshops, which have further extended the impact of her\u000d\u000a      work to British\u000d\u000a      audiences [S6].\u000d\u000a    Enhanced creativity and society at a micro-level. Bunn and her\u000d\u000a      close field contacts have\u000d\u000a      continued to develop their work together from the field period onwards,\u000d\u000a      and have seen their lives\u000d\u000a      enriched through their on-going mutual collaborations, as agreed by\u000d\u000a      participants [S4]. Two field\u000d\u000a      contacts ultimately secured employment as leading figures in international\u000d\u000a      agencies (UNIFEM and\u000d\u000a      CACSA), while several field participants secured international invitations\u000d\u000a      and subsequent\u000d\u000a      employment in Kyrgyzstan as trainers. This widening, ongoing network\u000d\u000a      enhances and regenerates\u000d\u000a      the benefits of collaboration, influencing further developments in both\u000d\u000a      individual lives and more\u000d\u000a      broadly in Kyrgyz women's craft initiatives. It is necessary to mention\u000d\u000a      the specificity of this impact,\u000d\u000a      because the domestic, low-profile aspect of many women's work in\u000d\u000a      Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia,\u000d\u000a      and the informal networks through which impact upon their work and lives\u000d\u000a      are disseminated, do not\u000d\u000a      necessarily comply with the kinds of more visible, pre-existing agencies\u000d\u000a      through which impact can\u000d\u000a      be identified.

The report\u000d\u000a      constituted the basis of the work of the OECD Working Party on\u000d\u000a      Biotechnology, comprising 33\u000d\u000a      member states, in formulating the influential new OECD policy on\u000d\u000a      harmonisation in biotechnology,\u000d\u000a      which subsequently led to its industrial biotechnology policy. The\u000d\u000a      Director of the OECD\u000d\u000a      International Futures Programme confirmed (14) the report was\u000d\u000a      discussed and presented in 60\u000d\u000a      OECD working groups, to member state governments (including Japan, US, UK\u000d\u000a      and Germany),\u000d\u000a      and to 14 large-scale stakeholder events. He also confirmed that the work\u000d\u000a      was `a crucial\u000d\u000a      contribution' to the OECD's involvement and influence in biotechnology.\u000d\u000a    The work of Adele Langlois has impacted public and policy discourse. As\u000d\u000a      part of her doctoral\u000d\u000a      studies, she secured a competitive scholarship from the Wellcome Trust to\u000d\u000a      undertake a fellowship\u000d\u000a      at POST (2008) to develop a policy briefing (13), widely\u000d\u000a      distributed among peers and MPs. POST's\u000d\u000a      Scientific Advisor for Biology and Health stressed the timeliness and\u000d\u000a      policy relevance of the work,\u000d\u000a      `which had been the reason for selecting Langlois's project for the\u000d\u000a        fellowship in the first place' (20).\u000d\u000a      The POSTnote received an average of 161 downloads a month during the\u000d\u000a      latest data period, and a\u000d\u000a      total of 1935 downloads by 2012.\u000d\u000a    Impact on African legislation and policy formulation and\u000d\u000a        implementation\u000d\u000a      AGLS research has been used to frame and establish new African policy and\u000d\u000a      regulation on drugs\u000d\u000a      and agro-biotechnology. Innogen's relationship with the AU began in 2006\u000d\u000a      with advice that led to\u000d\u000a      policy initiatives that improved and harmonised regulation of medicines\u000d\u000a      and biosafety. Chataway,\u000d\u000a      Mugwagwa et al wrote an invited report on building the case\u000d\u000a      for health systems innovation in\u000d\u000a      Africa, which the Science and Technology Advisor of NEPAD\/AU confirmed\u000d\u000a      formed the\u000d\u000a      background document for the 8th Summit of the AU (2007). He\u000d\u000a      confirmed also that the work\u000d\u000a      informed ministerial-level discussions that led to the inter-ministerial\u000d\u000a      agreement on the science and\u000d\u000a      technology programme of NEPAD\/AU, an example of international policy\u000d\u000a      impact (15). Later, it was\u000d\u000a      published as a book by the AU and made widely available in paper and\u000d\u000a      online (11). 15,000 copies\u000d\u000a      were distributed, and the book is now widely used by Ministries of Health\u000d\u000a      throughout Africa in\u000d\u000a      developing health policy.\u000d\u000a    While attached to the NEPAD Office of Science and Technology (2007), Mugwagwa\u000d\u000a      used the\u000d\u000a      AGLS approach to develop a framework on medicine control harmonisation.\u000d\u000a      The Director of the\u000d\u000a      African Biosafety Network of Expertise (ABNE) and the Scientific Affairs\u000d\u000a      Officer of the Economic\u000d\u000a      Commission for Africa confirmed that this work constituted a core\u000d\u000a      dimension of the policy to\u000d\u000a      harmonise drug regulation within the AU (16). In particular, it\u000d\u000a      determined the agreed approach of\u000d\u000a      cluster-based harmonisation, as opposed to horizontal harmonisation across\u000d\u000a      all countries.\u000d\u000a    In Kenya, Innogen research impacted agro-biotechnology legislation and\u000d\u000a      policy, as a result of\u000d\u000a      Kingiri's work with government agencies. During her OU doctorate\u000d\u000a      (2004-08), she worked on the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the Kenyan National Biosafety Act using Innogen\u000d\u000a      approaches. Following\u000d\u000a      completion in 2009, she joined the African Centre for Technology Studies\u000d\u000a      in Kenya and was invited\u000d\u000a      to join the team drafting regulations later appended to the Biosafety Act.\u000d\u000a      She contributed to four\u000d\u000a      draft regulations (environmental release; import, export and transit;\u000d\u000a      contained use; labelling)\u000d\u000a      approved in 2011 and 2012. The Biosafety Director of the Kenyan Biosafety\u000d\u000a      Authority (KBA)\u000d\u000a      confirmed the importance of her work and involvement from the initial\u000d\u000a      stages of the development of\u000d\u000a      the policy in 2008 (17). In addition, he stated that Kingiri and\u000d\u000a      her Innogen experience were\u000d\u000a      instrumental in the development of Kenya's first guidelines for inspection\u000d\u000a      and monitoring of\u000d\u000a      genetically modified (GM) field trials, a clear example of policy impact.\u000d\u000a      Kingiri is also a registered\u000d\u000a      member of the Kenyan Roster of Experts on Biosafety and the KBA confirmed\u000d\u000a      Kingiri's Innogen\u000d\u000a      experience as important for her major role advising on new applications\u000d\u000a      for GMO field trials in\u000d\u000a      Kenya.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Qatar national research strategy\u000d\u000a      In Qatar, working with RAND researchers, Chataway used Innogen\u000d\u000a      research on research\u000d\u000a      governance and as PI, led a project that resulted in the Qatar National\u000d\u000a      Research Strategy 2012\u000d\u000a      with its strong focus on responsible and participative development of life\u000d\u000a      sciences, health and\u000d\u000a      environment. The Executive Director of the Research Division of the Qatar\u000d\u000a      National Research\u000d\u000a      Foundation stated that Chataway's expertise and leadership was fundamental\u000d\u000a      in formulating the\u000d\u000a      strategy, which has been formally adopted as national policy.\u000d\u000a      Implementation is underway (18).\u000d\u000a    In summary, Innogen's research question, `Can the life sciences be\u000d\u000a        better regulated globally?' has\u000d\u000a      led to significant influence and impact, which suggests not only that\u000d\u000a      regulation (and related\u000d\u000a      governance frameworks) can be improved, but also that Innogen has played a\u000d\u000a      significant role in its\u000d\u000a      improvement.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The ESRC Innogen Centre brought together a multiplicity of disciplines\u000d\u000a      for a large 12-year\u000d\u000a      research programme (2002-14) on the impact of regulation on innovation\u000d\u000a      dynamics in the life\u000d\u000a      sciences.

The OU programme has\u000d\u000a      a global\u000d\u000a      perspective with major empirical research results from Europe, North and\u000d\u000a      South America, Africa\u000d\u000a      and Asia (1-3).\u000d\u000a    AGLS focuses on the question: `Can the life sciences be better\u000d\u000a        regulated globally?' The research\u000d\u000a      programme investigates regulation and governance broadly &#8212; within a\u000d\u000a      framework of stakeholder\u000d\u000a      interaction, rather than as barriers to simple linear progression &#8212; as key\u000d\u000a      drivers of innovation.\u000d\u000a      Using a `triangle' model to structure our pathway to impact, our work\u000d\u000a      links three broad groups of\u000d\u000a      stakeholders: innovators (scientists, medics, farmers, firms); government\u000d\u000a        and regulators\u000d\u000a      (multilaterals, OECD, EU); and public advocacy groups (patient\u000d\u000a      advocacy groups, NGOs). Our\u000d\u000a      research demonstrates that inappropriate and overly complex regulation can\u000d\u000a      prevent the\u000d\u000a      development of innovative and potentially beneficial technologies in the\u000d\u000a      life sciences (4). Work in\u000d\u000a      more than 20 countries across four continents shows that regulation\u000d\u000a      strongly influences which\u000d\u000a      products are developed and which companies take the lead in their\u000d\u000a      development, and that poor\u000d\u000a      regulation decreases sectoral dynamism and plays into the dearth of\u000d\u000a      innovation in new medicines\u000d\u000a      and agricultural products (5-9).\u000d\u000a    Through analysing pharmaceutical sector changes, Innogen has investigated\u000d\u000a      new actors and\u000d\u000a      institutions that are changing regulation and governance structures (4,\u000d\u000a        10), finding that advances\u000d\u000a      have occurred in stratified medicine, rare and neglected disease\u000d\u000a      innovation, stem cells, and\u000d\u000a      synthetic biology, but regulatory systems are lagging behind.

Developing a strategic response to China's presence in Africa.\u000a    The AERC's large multi-year Asian Drivers programme (2007-2011) arose out\u000a      of a direct initiative from Professor Kaplinsky, who was on the\u000a      steering committee for the duration of the programme (12). Funding\u000a      of $2.5m was provided by Rockefeller and the International Development\u000a      Research Centre (IDRC) and resulted in scoping studies in 21 countries and\u000a      in-depth studies in 14 countries. Dissemination included an AfDB meeting\u000a      in Dakar (May 2009) attended by 60 people, including Ministers of Finance\u000a      and senior civil servants. National workshops were organised in 14\u000a      countries with senior government officials, Chinese embassy and private\u000a      stakeholders. Regional dissemination workshops were held in Addis for\u000a      ambassadors and Chinese embassy (Sept 2010, 114 participants), and Accra\u000a      (April 2011, 54 participants from 20 countries, the Common Market for\u000a      Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Economic Commission of West\u000a      African States (ECOWAS) and ECA).\u000a    The country impact played an important role in guiding relations with\u000a      China. In several countries it led to the establishment of technical\u000a      committees advising governments on how to engage with China. Many of the\u000a      40 African researchers involved in the AERC programme used the methodology\u000a      to analyse Africa's engagement with other Rising Powers.\u000a    The MMCP (2009-2012) was a joint OU-University of Cape Town (UCT)\u000a      research programme, and included collaboration with Universities of\u000a      Ibadan, Ghana, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Mzumbe (Tanzania) and Wolverhampton.\u000a      Funding was provided by the IDRC, the Hewlett Foundation and the\u000a      Oppenheimer Fund, totalling $780K (13). In addition to extensive\u000a      publications and policy briefs, 9 stakeholders attended workshops, and\u000a      research was discussed at 10 Policy Dialogue Workshops &#8212; Common Fund for\u000a      Commodities (&gt;100 policymakers); World Bank (Policy Dialogue with 150\u000a      participants); AfDB (more than 500 delegates; Kaplinsky plenary\u000a      with Claire Short (Chair, Ethical Trading Initiative), the Director\u000a      General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\u000a      and ex PM Sierra Leone; UNCTAD (more than 100 delegates, three times);\u000a      AERC (see above); World Economic Forum; the International Council on\u000a      Mining and Metals; the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation\u000a      (UNIDO, including three Ministers); and Afrexim Bank.\u000a    There has been extensive referencing to OU research on Asian Drivers in\u000a      UNCTAD Global Commodity Reports, World Investment Report and Trade and\u000a      Development Reports (all annual), UNIDO Industrial Development Report, ECA\u000a      Annual Report and OECD Development Centre Annual Reports.\u000a    In summary, OU research on the insertion of Rising Powers into Africa's\u000a      infrastructure and commodity sectors highlighted the significance of the\u000a      bundling of aid, trade and FDI by China, India and Brazil. It resulted in\u000a      two high level Policy Dialogues in Addis, each involving more than 20\u000a      delegates from the ECA, the AU, NEPAD, Programme for Infrastructure\u000a      Development in Africa (PIDA) and the ECA, as well as African universities.\u000a    2. Impact on industrial policies\u000a    China's manufacturing prowess and the China-induced commodities price\u000a      boom have both had adverse effects on African and Central Asian industry.\u000a      Working closely with UNIDO, OU researchers and collaborators developed a\u000a      policy framework for the broadening and deepening of linkages from the\u000a      commodities sectors (17). This was presented at many of the MMCP\u000a      Policy Dialogues, as well as at meetings in UNCTAD and UNIDO with senior\u000a      policymakers. The monograph written for UNIDO unusually went into a second\u000a      edition very rapidly and has high reach globally.\u000a    The research was used to review and support the 2013 UNCTAD World\u000a      Investment Report (WIR). Within the 2012 calendar year, the 2012 WIR had\u000a      120,000 downloads and 1,000 per day in the first month, with specific\u000a      requests from 450 policymakers for background reports. Drawing on our\u000a      analysis of China's participation in global value chains, it helped change\u000a      the focus in industrial policy from a fixation with gross exports to a\u000a      policy agenda designed to promote capabilities (18).\u000a    Direct and specific impact on policy\u000a    Walmart acquired South Africa's Massmart chain in 2009 as a vehicle for\u000a      penetrating Africa's retail sector. The potential impact of this in\u000a      diverting currently locally-sourced inputs to China-sourced inputs was\u000a      addressed in a key ruling of the SA Competitions Court in July 2012. The\u000a      Chief Judge of the Court referred extensively and explicitly to OU MMCP\u000a      research in the Court's deliberations (14). Its ruling will have\u000a      far-reaching implications, not just on competitions policy in South\u000a      Africa, but on Africa's retail sector, and local and regional sourcing.\u000a    Turning to the firm level, the deepening of linkages from Africa's\u000a      commodity sector requires the building of capabilities in supplying firms.\u000a      Participation in the MMCP research programme assisted an East African firm\u000a      to develop a local procurement system and to persuade its client, TNC\u000a      Mining Company, to deepen its local sourcing beyond fresh fruit and\u000a      vegetables (15). This has the potential to extend to other mines in\u000a      the region, and is used to inform policy dialogues with the World Bank,\u000a      UNCTAD and the World Economic Forum.\u000a    Impact on practitioners and professional practice\u000a    In the context of rising competitive pressures from Asian suppliers, two\u000a      relative success stories in South Africa's recent dismal manufacturing\u000a      experience have been auto components and (to a lesser extent) apparel.\u000a    Drawing explicitly on OU MMCP research and interactions with OU\u000a      researchers, a South African consulting company has been heavily engaged\u000a      in helping to upgrade capabilities in these sectors and has assisted the\u000a      South African government in the design of industrial policy towards these\u000a      and other sectors. It has specialised in the development of backward\u000a      linkages (and horizontal spillovers to other sectors), significantly\u000a      strengthened by local business services firms engaging in supply chain\u000a      development. The largest of these firms, whose activities now extend to\u000a      other African economies and to Central Europe and Asia, explicitly drew on\u000a      OU research in order to develop its practical programmes of support to\u000a      local industry (16). It has an internship programme and employs 30\u000a      professionals, and has been particularly successful in providing training\u000a      and work experience to South Africans from historically disadvantaged\u000a      communities, many of who have moved to jobs in government and the\u000a      consulting sector. In addition to this impact on practitioners and\u000a      professional practice, this firm is currently actively engaging with a\u000a      large number of firms (more than 200 in the auto sector alone). It is\u000a      widely acknowledged in the industry and in government that without the\u000a      operations of this firm, South Africa's auto components sector\u000a      (particularly) and apparel industry would have been even more deeply\u000a      undermined by competition from the Rising Powers in Asia.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In the context of the changing centre of gravity of the global economy,\u000a      the Rising Powers in general, and China in particular, have become major\u000a      actors on the African stage. Their relatively rapid entry is a disruptive\u000a      presence and poses significant challenges to established policy\u000a      trajectories in the public and private sectors, in civil society\u000a      organisations, and to multilateral and bilateral aid agencies.

This framework is widely used in the\u000a      literature and formed the core structure of the African Economic Research\u000a      Consortium's (AERC) Asian Driver programme. In addition to documenting the\u000a      rapid and diversified entry of China onto the continent, and contrasting\u000a      this with the experience of other Rising Powers and Northern economies,\u000a      the research highlighted the challenge posed by China's entry to the\u000a      Washington Consensus. The recognition of China's bundling of aid, trade\u000a      and FDI exposed by this research programme is increasingly recognised as\u000a      both a strategic challenge and an opportunity to develop policy in Africa\u000a      (5). A key theoretical contribution was to highlight the mechanisms\u000a      whereby the indirect impacts of the Rising Powers have often been more\u000a      important than direct bilateral impacts. Building on this research, OU\u000a      researchers analysed the impact of China and other middle-income countries\u000a      on the prices of global commodities and the terms of trade (5).\u000a      Working with a network of 15 predominantly African researchers in nine\u000a      African countries, on the Making the Most of Commodities Research\u000a      Programme (MMCP) (1) we have made a major theoretical contribution\u000a      to rethinking the implications for industrial policies, as well as\u000a      producing unique primary material (6).\u000a    The enquiry was widened beyond China to a larger group of Rising Powers\u000a      in work with the UN Office of Special Adviser to Africa, the Economic\u000a      Commission for Africa (ECA), the African Union (AU), the New Partnership\u000a      for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\u000a      It documented the involvement in Africa of Brazil, China, India and Korea,\u000a      as well as Malaysia, Turkey and Russia and challenged the widespread\u000a      tendency to view these \"Rising Powers\" as a homogenous group of countries\u000a      (7). This was followed by a Report in 2013, which focused on the\u000a      participation of these Rising Powers in Africa's infrastructure and\u000a      commodity sectors (11).\u000a    One consequence of the global emergence of the Rising Powers is a shift\u000a      in final markets from the North to the South. The result is that value\u000a      chains have become less standards intensive. The reduction in standards\u000a      provides more scope for small scale producers to participate in export\u000a      markets, but this reduces the drive to capability-building; and, unlike\u000a      Northern importers who are happy for some of the processing to be done in\u000a      Africa, Chinese buyers are more focused on the import of unprocessed\u000a      commodities than Northern buyers (9). The OU study of the impact of\u000a      this shift in markets was the first of its kind and is being explored by a\u000a      range of researchers, including in a DFID-funded Manchester project.\u000a    Through a series of ESRC funded projects (2-4), the OU team has\u000a      moved the analytical and policy debate from a crude and widely held\u000a      `impact of China on Africa' perspective to identify the role of African\u000a      agents in this growing interaction between China and Africa. It also\u000a      revealed the importance of non-state owned medium sized firms and\u000a      small-scale Chinese firms, documented the scale of Chinese migration to\u000a      Africa and evidenced the proactive role being played by Africa's private\u000a      sector in deepening links with China (10). This has played a\u000a      leading role in shifting the debate away from `the impact on Africa' to\u000a      `Africa's engagement with Rising Powers'.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36905","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1.

According\u000a      to a Director of AM, Mackintosh's `pioneering work [...] provided\u000a        scientific evidence in a debate\u000a        which was dominated by sentiment.' Her research `contributed to\u000a        the decision made by Action\u000a        Medeor to open a second warehouse in Masasi, in the very South of\u000a        Tanzania'. (15) The research\u000a      has been referenced in the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for\u000a        Africa Business Plan produced\u000a      by UNIDO and the African Union Commission.\u000a    The East African Community and firms in Zimbabwe have taken up Banda's\u000a      work on finance\u000a      capability and the financing of local pharmaceutical production,\u000a      emphasising its link with\u000a      technological capability and innovation. Policy impact in the East African\u000a      Community and sub-\u000a      Saharan Africa was enhanced by Banda's participation in the Euro-Africa\u000a      Health Investment\u000a      Conference (April 2013). This work directly led to commercial impact when,\u000a      after discussions of\u000a      Banda's research, a Zimbabwean pharmaceutical firm, Varichem, accessed a\u000a      $10mUS long-term\u000a      loan from an African development bank for a major reinvestment programme\u000a      in new production\u000a      equipment and machinery (14).\u000a    Health sector: Product development partnerships (PDPs) and health\u000a        innovation systems\u000a    Research by Chataway, Hanlin and colleagues on public-private\u000a      PDPs and health innovation\u000a      systems has had broad international influence, with impacts on policy\u000a      development and strategies\u000a      of the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI). The IAVI is a PDP\u000a      that collaborates with more\u000a      than 50 academic, industry and government organisations around the world\u000a      to research and\u000a      develop AIDS vaccines, and to advocate for the HIV-prevention field. The\u000a      Regional Director of IAVI\u000a      confirms that Chataway and Hanlin's evaluation of IAVI had a major impact\u000a      on strategy (17),\u000a      particularly with regard to capacity building activities. Objective\u000a      research and the codification of\u000a      IAVI capacity building efforts carried out by Chataway and Hanlin also\u000a      contributed to IAVI's\u000a      fundraising efforts. The evaluation informed the governance of the PDP and\u000a      validated the model.\u000a      Subsequently, Chataway has advised on the strategies of PDPs in the\u000a      current difficult funding\u000a      climate, and Hanlin and Chataway have been invited to help develop a new\u000a      evaluation of IAVI's\u000a      capacity building in Africa. Expertise in assessing health partnerships\u000a      led to: work for the Swiss\u000a      Tropical Institute to assist in evaluating the Global Alliance for\u000a      Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI)\u000a      Alliance's Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) on pneumococcal vaccines at\u000a      baseline, and more\u000a      recently a request to be involved in the latest evaluation activity of the\u000a      AMC mechanism; and work\u000a      for the GAVI Alliance on the provision of incentives for the investment in\u000a      products targeting\u000a      neglected diseases.\u000a    2. Agriculture sector impact\u000a    Work undertaken by Clark has been utilised by European, African\u000a      and international organisations.\u000a      He has had an impact on the policy decisions and funding strategies\u000a      governing the UK Department\u000a      for International Development (DFID) and, in particular, has played a\u000a      significant role in the\u000a      development of the Research into Use (RIU) strategy for awarding\u000a      funding to technology\u000a      development consortia across Africa through his role as Economic Adviser\u000a      to the Director of this\u000a      programme (16). For example, he helped devise and facilitate a\u000a      `Dragons Den'-style competition\u000a      in Nairobi, which brought together an African panel of venture capitalists\u000a      and entrepreneurs to\u000a      select these consortia. Approximately 50 people took part in the training\u000a      workshop and the\u000a      programme organisers received positive feedback on the value of the\u000a      exercise. According to the\u000a      RIU Director, the `Dragons Den' exercise ensured that projects were\u000a      funded, which would not\u000a      previously have received funding, as they were more applied and commercial\u000a      in focus and the\u000a      funding decisions were more targeted at achieving outcomes in terms of\u000a      technology and product\u000a      development (16). Funded `Best Bets' projects include: Armyworm\u000a      control (Kenya and Tanzania);\u000a      Striga control\/seed priming (Kenya); and BCAs (bio control agents) in\u000a      Ghana. Other successful\u000a      projects include Farm Input Promotions Ltd (FIPS), an NGO that focuses on\u000a      input supply to\u000a      smallholders. Well-Told Story Ltd runs a communications initiative\u000a      designed to transfer\u000a      technologies to unemployed youth, and The Sleeping Sickness Control (SOS)\u000a      project is aimed at\u000a      stopping the spread of cattle-driven Trypanosomiasis through a project run\u000a      jointly with the private\u000a      sector and the University of Makerere. A project designed to use\u000a      multi-media opportunities for\u000a      unemployed youth won the international One World Award in May 2011 and the\u000a      2012 Digital\u000a      Emmy award for best programme in Children and Young People category.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Open University (OU) research into private sector investment and\u000a      innovation processes in Africa\u000a      and their equity implications has achieved wide national and global reach.\u000a      The research has had\u000a      direct impact on the health and agriculture sectors and in innovation\u000a      policy, leading to requests for\u000a      further policy-oriented research, the inclusion of research results into\u000a      policy and practitioner\u000a      publications, and direct implementation into policy.

This led to the acceptance of the suggested alternative\u000d\u000a      strategies in several locations. His Royal Highness Charles Okumu Ombidi\u000d\u000a      III confirmed that \"At first there was a reluctance by many people here to\u000d\u000a      take the drugs, but after your work and your help with sensitising the\u000d\u000a      people, there was widespread recognition that it is important to get\u000d\u000a      regular treatment for this disease...following your recommendations in\u000d\u000a      2008 and 2009, the procedure for distributing drugs changed in Panyimur\u000d\u000a      sub-county...the local council representatives took responsibility for\u000d\u000a      distributing the drugs in their localities.

This I believe was achieved through your\u000d\u000a      participatory approach of research, community mobilization and\u000d\u000a      sensitization.\" [B]\u000d\u000a    In Tanzania, the research showed that the majority of the study\u000d\u000a      population in coastal areas were resisting treatment for lymphatic\u000d\u000a      filariasis. Allen and Parker suggested to Tanzanian officials that MDA\u000d\u000a      should be supplemented with the provision of free surgery for those with\u000d\u000a      hydroceles (swollen scrotums), because the men who were successfully\u000d\u000a      treated would then become positive examples and advocates for the MDA\u000d\u000a      programme. In 2008 this advice was acted upon and 200 men were offered\u000d\u000a      hydrocelectomies [C]. Research in 2011 confirmed that this had an impact\u000d\u000a      on the uptake of drugs in those locations in which appropriate follow-up\u000d\u000a      occurred. In one study village (with an estimated population of 2000),\u000d\u000a      uptake increased from 40% in 2007 to more than 90% in 2010.\u000d\u000a    Influencing practice\u000d\u000a      In 2008 the initial findings [1] were published indicating that MDA in\u000d\u000a      combination with other approaches could be effective but that MDA\u000d\u000a      delivered in a context-free manner commonly faltered or failed. These\u000d\u000a      findings garnered attention from key figures and institutions involved in\u000d\u000a      the battle against infectious disease.

The WHO's Tropical Disease Research (TDR)\u000d\u000a      division then commissioned Allen and Parker to write an article on the\u000d\u000a      roll-out of MDA in Uganda as one of a series of papers considering how NTD\u000d\u000a      research and practice \"still largely neglect the social, ecological, and\u000d\u000a      other contextual factors that allow diseases to persist in specific\u000d\u000a      populations\". The paper [2] was made publicly available on TDR's website\u000d\u000a      in January 2011 [F], and was cited in the lead paper of the series\u000d\u000a      authored by TDR Steering Committee member Pascale Allotey and her\u000d\u000a      colleagues [F] to draw attention to implementation problems at the\u000d\u000a      community level and to call for social science research to assess the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of NTD control programmes. The paper was also circulated for\u000d\u000a      discussion to delegates at the 2011 International Society for Infectious\u000d\u000a      Diseases conference, and has been noted as one of the most important\u000d\u000a      publications about schistosomiasis in Expert Reviews, which described it\u000d\u000a      as an \"important evaluation highlighting that community compliance with\u000d\u000a      praziquantel treatment needs careful attention\" [G].\u000d\u000a    In February 2011 the underpinning research was again featured in an\u000d\u000a      article written by Allen and Parker [3] for a special issue of Third\u000d\u000a        World Quarterly called \"The Millennium Development Goals:\u000d\u000a      challenges, prospects and opportunities\". Allen and Parker's call for a\u000d\u000a      biosocial approach was echoed by UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon in his\u000d\u000a      Preface to the issue when he pointed to \"knowledge gained over the past\u000d\u000a      decade about the effectiveness of taking a holistic approach\".\u000d\u000a    Challenging MDA strategies\u000d\u000a      The high profile of the Third World Quarterly article, and the\u000d\u000a      call it made to rethink a context-free MDA approach, became the impetus\u000d\u000a      for debate within the infectious disease community. A vehement defence of\u000d\u000a      the mainstream MDA approach in a leading medical journal prompted Allen\u000d\u000a      and Parker to submit a letter to The Lancet in January 2012\u000d\u000a      entitled `Will increased funding for NTDs really make poverty history?'\u000d\u000a      [H]. The letter again outlined some of the difficulties with current\u000d\u000a      strategies, observed the lack of critical analysis and debate about \"what\u000d\u000a      is actually occurring on the ground\", and called for an evidence-based and\u000d\u000a      integrated biosocial approach. Published on the front page, the letter was\u000d\u000a      timed to appear on the eve of an international meeting in London at which\u000d\u000a      DfID, USAID, the UAE governments, the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, 13\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical companies and other global health organisations were\u000d\u000a      announcing a coordinated partnership to eliminate 10 NTDs by 2020,\u000d\u000a      involving commitments of over $785 million and significant in-kind\u000d\u000a      support. The timing and content of the letter provoked a storm of\u000d\u000a      controversy, and responses from leading proponents and critics of\u000d\u000a      context-free MDA were published in The Lancet. The debate was\u000d\u000a      noted in the Guardian [I] and by DFID, which had committed &#163;195 million to\u000d\u000a      the NTD global partnership.\u000d\u000a    Soon, however, the debate began to turn and the significance of the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research to be publicly acknowledged. In June 2012 Allen and\u000d\u000a      Parker made a keynote address at the International Society for Neglected\u000d\u000a      Tropical Diseases conference at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical\u000d\u000a      Medicine. At that meeting, the head of the Schistosomiasis Control\u000d\u000a      Initiative at Imperial College, a leading figure in the MDA community,\u000d\u000a      stated to a surprised audience that the kind of work Allen and Parker had\u000d\u000a      been doing needed to be done at all sites at which mass drug\u000d\u000a      administration was being implemented. In December 2012, Allen and Parker\u000d\u000a      were invited to a meeting in the UK Parliament on the possibilities of\u000d\u000a      mass drug administration, where they discussed their findings with DfID's\u000d\u000a      Chief Scientific Advisor and head of research, Professor Chris Whitty. A\u000d\u000a      month later, Allen and Parker's research was mentioned during a debate on\u000d\u000a      NTDs in the House of Lords, with the Earl of Sandwich, the Lord Bishop of\u000d\u000a      Derby and Lord Rae citing their findings and most of the speakers\u000d\u000a      emphasising communication, training and a biosocial approach [J].\u000d\u000a      Following this, Allen and Parker were asked to address MPs specifically\u000d\u000a      about the problems with MDA for lymphatic filariasis at the All-Party\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary Group on Malaria and NTDs. In this session, it was openly\u000d\u000a      acknowledged by one of the leading proponents of MDA that their research\u000d\u000a      was having a profound effect on shifting approaches to drug distribution\u000d\u000a      and monitoring.\u000d\u000a    In July 2013 an international conference was convened in London by Allen\u000d\u000a      and Parker with Dr Katja Polman of the Institute of Tropical Medicine,\u000d\u000a      Antwerp to bring together people from across the debate. The 20-plus\u000d\u000a      attendees included many of the leading supporters of MDA as well as senior\u000d\u000a      figures from African countries. The impact of the research was again\u000d\u000a      explicitly acknowledged and there was detailed discussion of how policies\u000d\u000a      were now being reformulated to take the findings into account. A range of\u000d\u000a      views were filmed and made available online [K].\u000d\u000a    Wider Implications: Over one billion people are at risk or already\u000d\u000a      afflicted by NTDs, 40 countries have multi-year NTD plans and close to &#163;1\u000d\u000a      billion in funding and in-kind assistance is committed to the control or\u000d\u000a      elimination of NTDs in the next five years. Only the locally sensitive and\u000d\u000a      effective deployment of this assistance will assure the permanent defeat\u000d\u000a      of these diseases and the alleviation of their deleterious impact on\u000d\u000a      lives, societies and economies around the world.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A research collaboration between LSE and Brunel University has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that large-scale programmes to control Neglected Tropical\u000d\u000a      Diseases (NTDs) through Mass Drug Administration (MDA) can be ineffective,\u000d\u000a      primarily because of flawed assumptions about local realities in\u000d\u000a      developing countries.

NTDs cause significant\u000d\u000a      morbidity (i.e. poor health, disease or disability) among politically and\u000d\u000a      economically marginal populations. The World Health Organization (WHO)\u000d\u000a      estimates that 120 million people are currently affected by lymphatic\u000d\u000a      filariasis, with about 40 million displaying clinical signs of infection\u000d\u000a      such as hydrocele (swollen scrotum) and lymphoedema\/elephantiasis (swollen\u000d\u000a      limbs). Estimates for schistosomiasis are even higher: more than 200\u000d\u000a      million people are affected and a further 600 million people are at risk\u000d\u000a      of infection. International assistance over the past ten years, including\u000d\u000a      massive donations of medicines, has enabled several countries to design\u000d\u000a      and implement large-scale programmes, referred to as Mass Drug\u000d\u000a      Administration (MDA), in which free treatment is given to adults and\u000d\u000a      children living in areas where these diseases are endemic.\u000d\u000a    From 2005, Professor Tim Allen was part of an international,\u000d\u000a      multi-disciplinary programme (based at Imperial College) to assess the\u000d\u000a      impact of current strategies to control NTDs. Allen and Dr Melissa Parker\u000d\u000a      of Brunel University shared equal responsibility for the social research\u000d\u000a      component of the programme. They each undertook 16 months of fieldwork in\u000d\u000a      Tanzania and Uganda and supervised a dozen postgraduate students from UK\u000d\u000a      and African institutions. Around 100 sites in Uganda and Tanzania were\u000d\u000a      studied intensively between 2005 and 2011. Allen and Parker's findings\u000d\u000a      have highlighted the following:\u000d\u000a    Social context: This influences the take-up of drugs with direct\u000d\u000a      consequences for disease transmission. In Uganda, for example, where\u000d\u000a      fisherfolk are highly likely to be infected with schistosomiasis, many are\u000d\u000a      not receiving treatment because they live on islands in the rivers and\u000d\u000a      lakes, whereas drug distribution is focussed in villages on the mainland.\u000d\u000a      This is particularly problematic because the fisherfolk use rivers and\u000d\u000a      lakes as a latrine, potentially causing the reinfection of anyone who has\u000d\u000a      been treated and goes into the water. [1,2,4,5]\u000d\u000a    Ineffective communication: Explanations for MDA have not been made\u000d\u000a      a priority. For example, in 2008 violent riots were observed in Tanzania\u000d\u000a      when parents became convinced that tablets were being given out in schools\u000d\u000a      to sterilise their children. [3,5]\u000d\u000a    Side-effects: MDA can have side-effects. These not only affect\u000d\u000a      people's willingness to take the drugs, but also raise doubts about the\u000d\u000a      merits of treating those who may be under-nourished, malnourished,\u000d\u000a      immuno-compromised and\/or infected with multiple parasitic infections.\u000d\u000a      Allen and Parker were the first to describe significant side effects from\u000d\u000a      mass treatment with praziquantel (for schistosomiasis control) and their\u000d\u000a      research has been recognised in the biomedical literature. [1]\u000d\u000a    NTDs differ: It is unhelpful to treat NTDs as a homogenous group.\u000d\u000a      The subjective experiences of their signs and symptoms vary within and\u000d\u000a      between populations and this influences drug uptake. [3]\u000d\u000a    Ethical challenges: These are numerous. A particular concern\u000d\u000a      raised by the research was that children were observed being given the\u000d\u000a      incorrect medication by school teachers who had not been appropriately\u000d\u000a      trained. Treatment in schools was also observed to have occurred without\u000d\u000a      adequate parental consent [6]\u000d\u000a    Monitoring and evaluation: Existing mechanisms for assessing\u000d\u000a      programmes are insufficient. There has been a failure to recognise the low\u000d\u000a      levels of drug take-up in some locations or to adequately assess the\u000d\u000a      biological and social effects of the programme. Assessments of MDA tend to\u000d\u000a      mix advocacy with research in misleading ways. Also, advocates of MDA are\u000d\u000a      prone to making exaggerated assertions. For example, eradication of\u000d\u000a      lymphatic filariasis in coastal Tanzania by 2020 is an impossibility\u000d\u000a      without changing current strategies.

In 2006 the research team were\u000d\u000a      asked to assist the European Space Agency in preparing a report on future\u000d\u000a      technology for human security, based on research into mission needs in\u000d\u000a      such conflict-affected countries as Afghanistan and Somalia and taking the\u000d\u000a      Barcelona Report as its official position. The report [G] has been\u000d\u000a      formally adopted, has already influenced the technology used to respond to\u000d\u000a      the Haiti earthquake in 2012, and is feeding into space R&amp;D planning,\u000d\u000a      in particular around satellite imagery and communications relevant to\u000d\u000a      conflict and emergency situations.\u000d\u000a    In response to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's call for a treaty on\u000d\u000a      European security in line with the Helsinki accords, Javier Solana also\u000d\u000a      called upon the Study Group to reconvene and develop proposals for a\u000d\u000a      'human security architecture' that would govern the Euro-Atlantic region\u000d\u000a      and particularly the relationship between the EU and Russia. In 2010\u000d\u000a      Professor Kaldor convened the group with the active involvement of Javier\u000d\u000a      Solana (now ex-High Representative), former Spanish Minister of Defence\u000d\u000a      Narcis Serra and a number of Russian scholars. The group's third report,\u000d\u000a      titled Helsinki Plus: A Human Security Architecture for Europe\u000d\u000a      [H], was commissioned by the Spanish Presidency of the EU and delivered to\u000d\u000a      President Medvedev and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign\u000d\u000a      Affairs and Security Policy, Lady Catherine Ashton.\u000d\u000a    The research team also became directly involved in the transfer of the\u000d\u000a      human security doctrine to ESDP missions when they were asked to develop a\u000d\u000a      human security training module for the European Crisis Management Centre\u000d\u000a      in Finland. In 2008 members of the team (Mary Kaldor, Mary Martin, Vesna\u000d\u000a      Bojicic together with Generals Andy Salmon and Klaus Reinhardt) undertook\u000d\u000a      a week's training for EU personnel (both military and civil) expected to\u000d\u000a      be deployed in Kosovo. It was the first time military and civilian\u000d\u000a      personnel had been trained together. Subsequently the crisis management\u000d\u000a      centre produced a human security training manual based on the module for\u000d\u000a      use in preparing personnel for other missions [I]. An estimated 600\u000d\u000a      participants have been trained in human security, many of whom work in\u000d\u000a      missions such as EUPOL Afghanistan. Course evaluations have revealed that\u000d\u000a      many of these participants welcomed the new way of thinking about\u000d\u000a      security.\u000d\u000a    Since that training, substantial evidence has accumulated demonstrating\u000d\u000a      that application of the human security doctrine can, in fact, produce a\u000d\u000a      significant and sustained impact on operations and results at the mission\u000d\u000a      level in countries experiencing conflict and emergency situations.\u000d\u000a      According to Javier Solana, the doctrine has \"had a direct influence on\u000d\u000a      ESDP missions, for example in DRC or Aceh, where we introduced human\u000d\u000a      rights monitors and held extensive civil society consultations. Moreover\u000d\u000a      the impact has been long-term\" [A]. Below is a range of examples of how\u000d\u000a      the human security doctrine has become \"a guiding principle for actual\u000d\u000a      operations\" [E, p592] in developing countries and the various kinds of\u000d\u000a      impact that it is producing:\u000d\u000a    Chad and Central African Republic (2008): Human security strongly\u000d\u000a      influenced the European security approach in Africa as \"an extremely\u000d\u000a      useful tool to avoid a deemed excessive militarisation\" [E, p592]. For\u000d\u000a      example, the EUFOR Chad\/CAR mission was focused on mobilising non-military\u000d\u000a      resources - financial, diplomatic and political - to train and equip\u000d\u000a      police, institute justice reforms and sponsor a peace process. Although\u000d\u000a      not a success in terms of civilian protection or repatriation, EUFOR was\u000d\u000a      deemed to have contributed to an improvement in regional security\u000d\u000a      infrastructure [E].\u000d\u000a    Iraq (2008-2009): The EU has emphasised human security through\u000d\u000a      reconstruction, rule of law and the political process in its approach to\u000d\u000a      Iraq [B]. A human security approach was also explicitly adopted by the UK\u000d\u000a      Commander of multinational forces in Southern Iraq after discussion with\u000d\u000a      members of the LSE research team, and put into direct practice from August\u000d\u000a      2008 to April 2009. Violent deaths declined dramatically - about 80% - in\u000d\u000a      the first three months as a direct result of this approach, which involved\u000d\u000a      taking British soldiers off the streets unless they were accompanying\u000d\u000a      Iraqi soldiers, removing weapons and arresting militants house by house\u000d\u000a      instead of using more kinetic approaches, and putting more emphasis on the\u000d\u000a      economic, social, political and cultural aspects of the situation [J,K].\u000d\u000a      Local elections produced a large turn-out and a majority perception that\u000d\u000a      the elections had been fair. Polls in 2009 showed that citizens' concerns\u000d\u000a      had shifted from militias, security and violence to jobs, healthcare and\u000d\u000a      utilities. US Ambassador Ryan Crocker called the change \"a radical\u000d\u000a      transformation\", and US General Petreus acknowledged the influence the\u000d\u000a      human security doctrine had had on the new COIN manual, \"which accompanied\u000d\u000a      the surge back in 2007 and game-changed in Iraq\" [J].\u000d\u000a    Afghanistan (2007-2010): In 2007 Brigadier Commander Mark\u000d\u000a      Carleton-Smith officially named Helmand a \"Human Security problem\".\u000d\u000a      Following a conference on human security at Sandhurst involving Professor\u000d\u000a      Kaldor, UK military officials used the 'inspiring' concept of human\u000d\u000a      security in planning and scenario analysis for Helmand Province. Analysis\u000d\u000a      revealed that the previous UK stabilisation strategy had been flawed\u000d\u000a      because it undermined consent and legitimacy from the Afghani people,\u000d\u000a      leading to 'perverse outcomes'. The human security concept was\u000d\u000a      incorporated into concrete plans for training and deployment, with\u000d\u000a      emphasis on \"equipping our commandos with the mind-set and toolkit to look\u000d\u000a      through the lens of the people, rather than enemies\" [J]. This approach\u000d\u000a      was credited with playing a critical role in the success of the 2009 tour\u000d\u000a      involving 45 commandos and has influenced ongoing decisions of the\u000d\u000a      reconstruction team.\u000d\u000a    Libya (2011): The EU's initial public response to the Libyan\u000d\u000a      crisis in February 2011 placed an emphasis on human rights, and\u000d\u000a      consequently the EUFOR Libya operation focused on safe movement and\u000d\u000a      evacuation of displaced persons and the delivery of humanitarian aid. The\u000d\u000a      EU interventions were considered successful in protecting both nationals\u000d\u000a      and EU citizens, in delivering humanitarian aid and in imposing\u000d\u000a      restrictive measures against the Libyan regime. EU officials confirmed\u000d\u000a      that human security had been the rationale behind the EU response [D].\u000d\u000a    Somalia (2008-now): For at least five years the EU has been\u000d\u000a      attempting to break the cycle of ongoing conflict and weak governance in\u000d\u000a      Somalia through development assistance combined with security measures and\u000d\u000a      reforms [B]. An explicit human security focus has been adopted by the EU\u000d\u000a      anti-piracy mission, with an emphasis on helping isolated and remote\u000d\u000a      communities badly affected by pirate activity, establishing a fishing\u000d\u000a      licencing scheme to rebuild the local fishing industry, and marginalising\u000d\u000a      or making irrelevant the pirates rather than defeating them in a\u000d\u000a      traditional military fashion. UK Rear Admiral Bob Tarrant, the Commander\u000d\u000a      of the EU anti-piracy mission, considers the human security approach\u000d\u000a      essential \"in reaching out to these communities and in being able to deal\u000d\u000a      with the permissive conditions that allow pirates to thrive unchecked\"\u000d\u000a      [L].\u000d\u000a    Burma (2013): In its current mission in Burma, the EU is insisting\u000d\u000a      that its training for riot police be accompanied by efforts to strengthen\u000d\u000a      community policing and produce better understanding of the concerns of\u000d\u000a      local communities. In addition, the primary author of the formal Inquiry\u000d\u000a      into the sectarian violence in Rakhine State has stated that the\u000d\u000a      perspective of human security is the only way to approach that problem\u000d\u000a      [M].\u000d\u000a    Wider Implications: Javier Solana's former chief of staff, Robert\u000d\u000a      Cooper, contends that, already, \"The concept of human security informs\u000d\u000a      almost all operations the EU undertakes, directly or indirectly\" [M]. Rear\u000d\u000a      Admiral Bob Tarrant predicts that it \"will be a central consideration in\u000d\u000a      military operations and humanitarian response tasks in the future\" [L],\u000d\u000a      while former Spanish Minister of Defence and Vice Prime Minister Narcis\u000d\u000a      Serra believes that it \"will be progressively accepted by nations and by\u000d\u000a      international organisations...And probably will become the only concept of\u000d\u000a      security accepted by our public opinion\" [N].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Mary Kaldor convened a study group that proposed a new human\u000d\u000a      security doctrine for the European Union at the request of its High\u000d\u000a      Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.

The research involved in-depth studies of\u000d\u000a      particular conflicts as well as studies of current capabilities, including\u000d\u000a      the role of international law. The strength of the research was that it\u000d\u000a      was field based and `bottom-up' in its focus on conflict-affected\u000d\u000a      situations in Africa, the Middle East, the post-Communist world and South\u000d\u000a      East Asia. Professor Kaldor's own research for the first report included a\u000d\u000a      case study of conflict in the South Caucasus [3] and, together with an\u000d\u000a      officer of the Royal Marines, research on how the military might be\u000d\u000a      deployed in human security missions to such conflict-affected areas [1].\u000d\u000a    In 2005, the Swedish Foreign Ministry asked the LSE team to prepare a\u000d\u000a      report on EU responses to the Tsunami and whether they were in conformity\u000d\u000a      with human security. The report included two case studies by Marlies\u000d\u000a      Glasius (Sri Lanka) and Kirsten Schulz (Aceh). In 2006 the Finnish Foreign\u000d\u000a      Ministry asked Professor Kaldor to reconvene the study group to prepare a\u000d\u000a      report on how the human security doctrine could be taken forward on the\u000d\u000a      European Union's agenda during the Finnish Presidency of the EU. For this\u000d\u000a      project, the background studies focussed on evaluation of existing\u000d\u000a      European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) missions, with Professor\u000d\u000a      Kaldor conducting studies of Palestine and Lebanon [6].\u000d\u000a    The research resulted in a first report called `A Human Security Doctrine\u000d\u000a      for Europe' [3] and a second report titled `A European Way of Security'\u000d\u000a      [6], known as the Barcelona Report and the Madrid Report and presented to\u000d\u000a      Solana in 2004 and 2007 respectively. In addition, the LSE research team\u000d\u000a      generated a series of academic articles, chapters and books [1,2,4,5,7].\u000d\u000a      What made this research distinctive, and what allowed it to achieve impact\u000d\u000a      of reach and significance, was that it generated a new concept of human\u000d\u000a      security based on extension of the rule of law and public order beyond the\u000d\u000a      borders of the EU. This concept was notably different from the so-called\u000d\u000a      'broad version' espoused by UNDP, in which human security focussed on\u000d\u000a      development and material security, and from the so-called 'narrow version'\u000d\u000a      put forward by the Canadians, which was associated with the concept of\u000d\u000a      'responsibility to protect' in such cases as genocide and massive\u000d\u000a      violations of human rights. This new 'Barcelona version', as it was\u000d\u000a      called, assumed that the EU no longer needed classic military forces to\u000d\u000a      defend borders and repel enemies, but rather that it needed the\u000d\u000a      capabilities required to contribute to global security, particularly in\u000d\u000a      terms of stabilising conflict and providing humanitarian assistance in\u000d\u000a      complex emergencies such as natural disasters. The Barcelona report\u000d\u000a      therefore proposed a human security force composed of both civilian and\u000d\u000a      military personnel, who would operate more like police than soldiers and\u000d\u000a      adhere to a set of human security principles that emphasised both law\u000d\u000a      enforcement and human rights.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers: Professor Kaldor is LSE Professor of Global\u000d\u000a      Governance and Director of the Civil Society and Human Security Research\u000d\u000a      Unit.

These have influenced international policy\u000a      debates and the formulation\u000a      of most major global organisations, whether reflecting on gender, land and\u000a      agriculture [see Section\u000a      5, C1, C3, C4 and C5], or on gender and development more widely (e.g. in\u000a      informing the World\u000a      Bank's World Development Report [C2]). In addition, the findings from the\u000a      research were taken\u000a      forward in Ghana by Tsikata, where Sussex's collaboration was used to\u000a      achieve substantial\u000a      development-policy impact.\u000a    The central arena of impact has been in legal reform concerning land. For\u000a      example Whitehead's\u000a      research is cited as a central analytical and evidential component in the\u000a      International Development\u000a      Law Organization's Community Land Titling initiative [C1]. This\u000a      intergovernmental organisation\u000a      offers legal expertise, resources, tools and professional support to\u000a      governments, multilateral\u000a      partners, and civil society organisations. Whitehead's analysis of the\u000a      challenges of informal justice\u000a      systems to advance the women's rights is cited in their programmatic\u000a      summary (2013) Accessing\u000a        Justice: Models, Strategies and Best Practices on Women's Empowerment\u000a      [C1].\u000a    Similarly, Whitehead's analysis of the potential pitfalls of\u000a      decentralised land institutions for gender-equitable\u000a      participation and representation became incorporated into the UN FAO's\u000a      policy\u000a      deliberation, initially via their analysis of Statutory Recognition of\u000a        customary Land Rights in Africa\u000a      (pp. 28-33) [C3] and, through this, becoming incorporated into their\u000a      (2013) technical guide\u000a      Governing Land for Women and Men: A Technical Guide to Support\u000a        Achievement of Responsible\u000a        Gender-Equitable Governance Land Tenure [C3]. The critique also fed\u000a      into the European Report\u000a        on Development through a preparatory paper addressing land-based\u000a      investments for food, fuel and\u000a      other agricultural commodities, and ways to strengthen local land rights\u000a      [C4].\u000a    As Whitehead's analysis not only addresses and reframes understandings of\u000a      gender and land, but\u000a      sets this within wider questions of poverty and land, her work has also\u000a      been influential in relation to\u000a      policies making or advocating changes in legislative practice to make\u000a      justice more accessible to\u000a      the poor generally; to poor men as well as poor women. This aspect of her\u000a      research was significant\u000a      to the World Bank's `Justice for the Poor' (J4P) programme in Kenya, for\u000a      example, with the\u000a      potential for land registration to undermine women's land rights informing\u000a      their Assessment of\u000a        Women's Access to Land Rights in Agricultural Communities in Kenya\u000a      [C5].\u000a    The significance of Whitehead's work is visible in national deliberations\u000a      in several sub-Saharan\u000a      countries, for example in the Bank of Namibia's deliberations on\u000a      `Unlocking the Economic Potential\u000a      of Communal Land,' where her work evidenced the problems for women of its\u000a      land titling [C6].\u000a    The impact of Whitehead's research can be discerned not only in general\u000a      policy, but also in\u000a      programmes implemented to improve the lives of the poor and marginalised.\u000a      For example, a World\u000a      Bank Evaluation [C7] provides clear evidence and insight into the way in\u000a      which Whitehead's\u000a      research transformed the somewhat fraught `Ghana Land Administration\u000a      Project'\u000a      (http:\/\/www.ghanalap.gov.gh\/).\u000a      This project had as a mission to strengthen `land administration and\u000a      management ... through ... appropriate land administration laws and\u000a      regulations, capacity building\u000a      for Land Sector Agencies, Land Owners and relevant NGOs, and streamline\u000a      business procedures\u000a      within the Land Agencies'. It began with a focus on land titling,\u000a      generating the problems anticipated\u000a      in Whitehead's analysis. When it was restructured in 2008, however, the\u000a      mix of activities was\u000a      altered, in particular to include a small-grants programme, to promote\u000a      civil-society participation in\u000a      local land administration, advocacy and debate on land issues. As the\u000a      World Bank (2013)\u000a      evaluation put it, `This was a belated concession to the counterweight\u000a      lobby: those who had\u000a      advocated early on for developing institutions outside the chieftaincy\u000a      orbit', citing Whitehead and\u000a      Tsikata (2003) [C7]. Whitehead and Tsikata had persistently questioned the\u000a      project for threatening\u000a      women's land access (and that of the poor) and Tsikata had since became a\u000a      member of the ISSER\u000a      (University of Ghana) team implementing a research and dissemination\u000a      workshop programme for\u000a      the Land Administration Project (LAP). By 2013 there were at least 25\u000a      small grants funding civil-society\u000a      organisations that supported the rights of the poor and marginalised and,\u000a      drilling down\u000a      further, one of these civil-society organisations had addressed some of\u000a      the failings [C8].\u000a    Given that Whitehead's research was very directly questioning World Bank\u000a      land policy in general,\u000a      and in Ghana, this change in project policy is all the more significant.\u000a      It is notable that later World\u000a      Bank outputs cite Whitehead's broader critique of neoliberalism in their\u000a      deliberations and policy on\u000a      Gender and Development in their World Development Report for 2012 [C2].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Whitehead's research on gender, economic liberalisation and land changed\u000a      the way in which\u000a      international organisations (the UN, the World Bank and the EU) approach\u000a      the gendered impacts\u000a      of land policy.

In many contexts,\u000a      customary practices, not\u000a      individual title, were the main basis for claims to land and, as these\u000a      were regarded as a barrier to\u000a      productive investment, there was a widespread call to increase individual\u000a      ownership with\u000a      registered titles. This was the centrepiece of the World Bank's highly\u000a      influential land policy and\u000a      funds flowed to support highly complex national enquiries, better land\u000a      administration and titling\u000a      reforms. Most African feminist lobbies also argued that women needed\u000a      registered titles to have\u000a      secure land rights as a basis for their economic security and livelihoods.\u000a    The innovation in Whitehead's (in collaboration with Tsikata, University\u000a      of Ghana) critical analysis\u000a      of land policy was the comprehensive assessment of the largely\u000a      ethnographic evidence of the\u000a      nature and strength of women's claims to land under customary practices,\u000a      which found compelling\u000a      evidence that registration for title favoured largely rural men and elites\u000a      and that women and the\u000a      poor lost out. This provided a trenchant critique of the dominant policy\u000a      for their detrimental effect\u000a      on women and the poor.\u000a    Their initial research was part of the 2000-05 UNRISD Project on Agrarian\u000a      Change, Gender and\u000a      Land Rights. Evidence from sub-Saharan Africa was complemented by case\u000a      studies of Zimbabwe\u000a      and Tanzania, initially producing Whitehead (2001) [see Section 3, R2],\u000a      then the full critique\u000a      (Whitehead and Tsikata 2003 [R1]). They found that the strength of women's\u000a      land claims under\u000a      customary systems is in their `social embeddedness', and this provides a\u000a      strong safety net.\u000a      Women's land entitlements are based on the fulfilment of a range of social\u000a      obligations to family\u000a      members, and thus the more well-connected and well-regarded a woman is,\u000a      the stronger her\u000a      claims to land (Whitehead and Tsikata 2003: 96-7).\u000a    Land titling is also accompanied by adjudication systems that deal with\u000a      title conflicts and the\u000a      balance of socially embedded claims and title. Whitehead revealed that\u000a      these new structures\u000a      reproduced existing adverse power relations with kin and family groups.\u000a      Unless specifically\u000a      guarded against, they are biased mainly towards men and rural elites.\u000a      Several socio-legal and\u000a      ethnographic cases showed that it was exceedingly difficult for women (and\u000a      men who lacked social\u000a      power) to assert their claims in these fora. The new administrative\u000a      structures systematically\u000a      overlooked socially embedded claims, so women lose access to farmland.\u000a      Since women are\u000a      responsible for much of Africa's food production, this compromises\u000a      national and household food\u000a      security.\u000a    Introducing individual title and a land market exposes big differences in\u000a      the resources and assets\u000a      of rural men and women. Relatively few women can buy land, but they lose\u000a      their safety net.\u000a      Whitehead's work on economic liberalisation and gender more generally is a\u000a      sustained account of\u000a      how, beginning from very different starting points, rural women cannot\u000a      take advantage of\u000a      liberalisation as much as men (and the poor even less than the\u000a      better-off). Women diversify their\u000a      livelihoods, as do men, but far far fewer make this a route out of\u000a      poverty.\u000a    Emeritus Professor Ann Whitehead has been a Sussex Anthropologist since\u000a      the 1970s.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37422","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"7909807","Name":"South Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"49518","Name":"Rwanda"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Eltringham's research has contributed to the development of early-warning\u000d\u000a      mechanisms to prevent genocide and other mass-atrocity crimes in the Great\u000d\u000a      Lakes Region, South Sudan and Kenya.\u000d\u000a    In 1994 an estimated 937,000 Rwandans, the vast majority Tutsi, were\u000d\u000a      murdered in a genocide committed by militia elements of the army, often\u000d\u000a      with the participation of the local population. The repercussions of the\u000d\u000a      Rwandan genocide led to conflict in the neighbouring Democratic Republic\u000d\u000a      of Congo, where more than 5 million people have died since 1996 as a\u000d\u000a      result of the fighting. In Uganda, the insurgency of the Lord's Resistance\u000d\u000a      Army (which began in 1988) has killed an estimated 100,000 people,\u000d\u000a      displaced 2.5 million people and involved the abduction of up to 100,000\u000d\u000a      children. In Sudan, in the Darfur region, it is estimated that, since\u000d\u000a      2003, between 200,000 and 400,000 people have been killed and 2.3 million\u000d\u000a      have been displaced. In Kenya, 1,300 people were killed and up to 600,000\u000d\u000a      displaced in post-election violence between December 2007 and January\u000d\u000a      2008.\u000d\u000a    Since 2010, the Office of the UN Secretary General's Special Advisor for\u000d\u000a      the Prevention of Genocide (OSAPG) has been working with the International\u000d\u000a      Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR; an inter-governmental\u000d\u000a      organisation of eleven member-states) to implement the 2006 `Protocol for\u000d\u000a      the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, War Crimes and\u000d\u000a      Crimes against Humanity and all Forms of Discrimination.

Eltringham delivered two\u000d\u000a      presentations in which he drew directly on his research on the Rwandan\u000d\u000a      genocide and its aftermath. The issues covered included perpetrators'\u000d\u000a      fantasies, paranoia, the use of euphemisms and dehumanisation, the use of\u000d\u000a      history to claim victimhood, the dangers of collectivising guilt and the\u000d\u000a      role of international criminal justice. Alongside another expert who\u000d\u000a      presented on the role of the media in genocide, Eltringham led group\u000d\u000a      discussion and facilitated group exercises. The training was attended by\u000d\u000a      the Chairperson and members of the South Sudan Peace and Reconciliation\u000d\u000a      Commission (SSPRC). At the initiative of the SSPRC, in response to the\u000d\u000a      workshop, the South Sudan government established a national Conflict Early\u000d\u000a      Warning and Response Unit (CEWERU) in May 2012 [see Section 5, C1].

Given the emphasis on the role\u000d\u000a      international criminal law could play in responding to genocide in the\u000d\u000a      Great Lakes Region (first through the International Criminal Tribunal for\u000d\u000a      Rwanda (ICTR) and then the International Criminal Court (ICC)), Eltringham\u000d\u000a      began to conduct ethnographic research at the ICTR (2005-07). By\u000d\u000a      concentrating on this discursive aftermath (rather than the actual\u000d\u000a      dynamics of the genocide itself), Eltringham has been able to contribute\u000d\u000a      to an understanding of how mass atrocity can become cyclical [see Section\u000d\u000a      3, R1]; the way in which exclusionary discourse is reproduced [R2]; and\u000d\u000a      the way in which genocide victim's bodies are discursive vehicles [R3].\u000d\u000a      Responding to the evolving political situation in Rwanda, Eltringham has\u000d\u000a      published on the proscription of ethnic identities in Rwanda, arguing that\u000d\u000a      Rwandans need to be able to refer to a benign form of ethnicity to\u000d\u000a      indicate a return to `normality' [R4]. This research has explored the\u000d\u000a      court as a `historio-preservation technology' and the extent to which it\u000d\u000a      can fulfil the dual purpose of determining individual guilt or innocence\u000d\u000a      and establish a historical record [R5]. In the same vein, research has\u000d\u000a      assessed the role that non-legal epistemologies (anthropology and history)\u000d\u000a      can play in the trials through the testimony of expert witnesses [R6].\u000d\u000a    In this way, Eltringham's research has resisted reconstructing the\u000d\u000a      Rwandan genocide as a historical event but, instead, has maintained a\u000d\u000a      dynamic relationship with how others try to account for the 1994 genocide,\u000d\u000a      whether through historical analogy or legal judgement. As such, the\u000d\u000a      research has contributed to theoretical and comparative research on the\u000d\u000a      anthropology of violence, narrative and memorialisation, while also making\u000d\u000a      practical contributions to the detection of, prevention of, and response\u000d\u000a      to, mass-atrocity crimes.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37455","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2088628","Name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2134431","Name":"Vanuatu"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Between 2009 and 2011, Professor Howell was contracted by the Australian\u000a      Agency for International Development (AusAID) to serve as lead researcher\u000a      on a fundamental review of AusAID's approach to civil society in its aid\u000a      programme to developing countries. The review was commissioned by the\u000a      Office of Development Effectiveness (ODE), an independent unit within\u000a      AusAID, with the purpose of highlighting the importance of civil society\u000a      to senior management, feeding evidence into AusAID's process for\u000a      developing a framework for civil society engagement and, ultimately,\u000a      improving AusAID's impact in terms of poverty reduction on the ground. The\u000a      underpinning research was pivotal in bringing Professor Howell to the\u000a      attention of AusAID, in defining the substantive approach used in the\u000a      review, and in generating the findings and recommendations [A,E].\u000a    The findings of the review were presented in a report titled `Working\u000a      Beyond Government: Evaluation of AusAID's Engagement with Civil Society in\u000a      Developing Countries' (Howell and Hall, 2012) [B] and related reports\u000a      focused on fieldwork in Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines\u000a      [C,D]. The main report made seven key recommendations grounded firmly in\u000a      the underpinning research. These included:\u000a    \u000a      develop a civil society framework that recognizes civil society in\u000a        developing countries as integral to the development process\u000a      incorporate analysis of civil society in country situation analyses\u000a        and integrate country- specific civil society strategies in country aid\u000a        strategies\u000a      invest in civil society advisors in headquarters and major country\u000a        programs, and activate networks for sharing lessons related to engaging\u000a        with civil society\u000a      develop a rationale for choosing aid program intermediaries not just\u000a        on a results basis but also for their ability to contribute to\u000a        developing a sustainable local civil society\u000a      include civil society in policy dialogue and implementation when\u000a        designing sector wide approaches with partner governments\u000a      support initiatives to strengthen the enabling environment for civil\u000a        society as part of strengthening civil society where appropriate\u000a    \u000a    AusAID management agreed to take forward all seven of the report's\u000a      recommendations [E,F]. According to Russell Miles, AusAID's Director of\u000a      NGO Policy, in his 2012 presentation at the Crawford School of Public\u000a      Policy [G], the response to the evaluation was not just the normal\u000a      management response but instead came directly from the AusAID Executive.\u000a      He emphasised that the Executive took the evaluation very seriously and\u000a      that it had focused their attention on the issue of civil society in a new\u000a      way. The Australian Council for International Development (ACFID), the\u000a      peak organisation for development NGOs, also indicated strong support for\u000a      the report and spoke in public forums about their intention to use it to\u000a      lobby AusAID for an increased focus on civil society engagement.\u000a    Subsequently, as a direct result of the report, AusAID issued a new\u000a      policy statement of Effective Governance and developed a new Civil Society\u000a      Engagement Framework in consultation with ACFID [F]. This framework,\u000a      formally released in 2012, \"recognises the emergence of an informed and\u000a      engaged civil society as an important development outcome in its own\u000a      right...and provides the overarching direction by which all seven of the\u000a      recommendations are implemented\" [H]. In publishing the Framework, AusAID\u000a      described the new approach as \"...a significant shift in the Australian\u000a      government's engagement with civil society organisations with a sharper\u000a      focus on: effectiveness, results, sustainability, risk reduction,\u000a      efficiency and value for money, diversity and innovation.\" [I]\u000a    Implementation of the report's recommendations has produced a number of\u000a      significant actions and impacts [F,J], including:\u000a    a) an increase in money going to NGOs in the context of AusAID's changing\u000a      approach to civil society, from $500 million in 2011-2012 to $700-800\u000a      million by 2015-16 (a 40-60% increase),\u000a    b) a doubling of funding to the Australian NGO Cooperation Project, from\u000a      $ 69 million in 2010- 2011 to $150 million by 2014-15,\u000a    c) establishment of the Civil Society Network, a cross-agency working\u000a      group,\u000a    d) establishment of the Civil Society Portal, a web portal for NGOs and\u000a      other civil society organisations that serves as a central hub for\u000a      information on accreditation, funding and other issues relevant to working\u000a      with AusAID\u000a    e) all country programmes conducting civil society analyses, and\u000a    f) governance and social development advisors taking responsibility for\u000a      engaging with civil society through dialogue, networking, projects and\u000a      strategic analysis.\u000a    Since 2012 the Civil Society Engagement Framework has been in the process\u000a      of being progressively rolled out in all 37 developing countries in which\u000a      AusAID works [I]. Jo Hall, ODE Director, provides examples of the\u000a      different ways in which this is being done from three country programmes\u000a      [H]:\u000a    \u000a      The Philippines programme has replaced its longstanding community\u000a        assistance programme involving small grants with a new programme called\u000a        `Coalitions for Change', a much more strategic approach for working with\u000a        civil society organisations as recommended by the Framework\u000a      In line with the new requirement to analyse `the role of civil society\u000a        in both policy development and service delivery' as part of country\u000a        situation analysis, the Indonesia programme has completed an NGO sector\u000a        review designed to maximize NGO involvement in poverty reduction,\u000a        identifying specific ways to engage directly with NGOs and to improve\u000a        the policy and funding environment in which they operate\u000a      The Papua New Guinea programme has worked with a range of civil\u000a        society organisations to help them map out their capacity-building needs\u000a        and to develop a concrete strategy for addressing those needs.\u000a    \u000a    Full implementation of the Civil Society Engagement Framework is expected\u000a      to be completed by 31 December 2013, following alignment with agency-wide\u000a      reforms and close consultations with ACFID and NGO members on key projects\u000a      [J]. Despite this formal end-date, the ODE Director predicts that the\u000a      report's \"concrete and positive impact on the way that AusAID works with\u000a      civil society through its aid program...is likely to continue to have\u000a      influence\" into the future [H].\u000a    Wider Implications: LSE work is contributing to better aid\u000a      delivery and monitoring mechanisms by an increasingly important donor\u000a      nation. Ceteris paribus, stronger civil societies should enable\u000a      more effective governance in aid-recipient countries.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Jude Howell served from 2009-2011 as lead researcher on a\u000a      fundamental review of the Australian Government's approach to civil\u000a      society in its developing country aid programmes.

It has involved both theoretical and empirical\u000a      research over more than a decade in various countries, notably China,\u000a      Afghanistan, Kenya and India.\u000a    The key findings that emerged in this body of research were as follows:\u000a    \u000a      It is important to uncover the implicit theoretical and normative\u000a        assumptions that are made by policy-makers and practitioners in their\u000a        engagements with civil society as a starting-point to critical\u000a        reflection and action. These might include assumptions about the role of\u000a        civil society in democratisation processes, in reducing poverty, and in\u000a        promoting notions of accountability and transparency [1,2,3,4].\u000a      Similarly, it is important to locate donor engagement with civil\u000a        society within a broader political context and debate around the\u000a        relative roles of civil society, the state and market in providing for\u000a        the public good and for global security. This includes not only the\u000a        debates within the donor country but also in the partner country, where\u000a        the very idea of civil society could potentially be perceived as\u000a        threatening as opposed to useful and welcome [1,2,5].\u000a      Civil society is a rich term and has much potential in terms of\u000a        opening up the field of actors and organisations to development\u000a        institutions. However, in practice many development agencies tend to\u000a        focus most of their energies on NGOs, at the expense of other civil\u000a        society organisations such as faith groups, trades unions, virtual\u000a        coalitions, and other ways of associating that may be more pivotal in\u000a        terms of social change. In engaging with civil society, it is therefore\u000a        important that development institutions also look beyond NGOs [2].\u000a      Donor agencies often operate with blueprints of ideal state-society\u000a        relations. However, LSE research has demonstrated the importance &#8212; when\u000a        supporting civil society in aid programmes &#8212; of understanding the local\u000a        context, including the history and nature of state- civil society\u000a        relations, the power relations amongst civil society actors, and the\u000a        competing visions and expectations of what civil society should and does\u000a        do in any context, and so on. It is thus vital not to assume that all\u000a        NGOs are necessarily agents of social change in a given context. It is\u000a        equally important to remain alert to the power dynamics within civil\u000a        society and to identify the key sources of change and continuity\u000a        [1,2,4,5,6].\u000a      The 9\/11 attacks and the `war on terror' have had a significant impact\u000a        on the relationships amongst security institutions, development aid and\u000a        civil society organisations. Civil society organisations have been drawn\u000a        into security agendas, either as possible suspects in fronting terrorism\u000a        or as adjutants in `hearts and minds' work and anti-radicalisation\u000a        programmes at home and abroad. [1,2,5].\u000a    \u000a    Key Researchers: The research was undertaken from 2003 - 2013 by\u000a      Professor Jude Howell, former Director of the Centre of Civil Society at\u000a      the LSE (2003-2010) and Director of the ESRC Non-Governmental Public\u000a      Action Programme. Her collaborator and co-author on this research was\u000a      Jeremy Lind (Research Fellow, Institute of Development Studies, University\u000a      of Sussex).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38409","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Contestation over displays of flags in public space has remained a key\u000a      issue in public debate in Northern Ireland and is an on-going issue in\u000a      peace-building. This research has provided the basis for the development\u000a      of public policy; it has had a very high profile in public debates over\u000a      the use of flags and emblems; it has been at the forefront of discussions\u000a      between public agencies attempting to engage with symbolic contestation;\u000a      it has been used by District councils and mediation groups in problem\u000a      solving; and it is being used by the United Nations as an example of how\u000a      to develop a strategy for understanding human rights and cultural\u000a      contestation in divided societies.\u000a    4.1 Impacts on Government Policy:\u000a      The initial project policy report, Transforming Conflict (Grant 2) had its\u000a      findings incorporated into the Government's Shared Future (2005:\u000a      19) policy. At the same time, the PSNI and Government departments\u000a      developed The Joint Protocol in Relation to the Displays of Flags in\u000a        Public Areas (2005). Funded by OFMDFM, the research team produced\u000a      annual reports (1) from 2006-2011 for the Government website as part of\u000a      their Good Relations Indicator Set (2). These reports evaluated\u000a      changes that might accrue as a result of the policies and Protocol.\u000a      Since 2009, Bryan has been a member of the Flags Protocol Review Group\u000a      (FPRG--constituted by OFMDFM- along with the Chief Executives of three\u000a      district Councils and representatives from Community Relations Council,\u000a      Equality Commission, PSNI, NI Housing Executive and four government\u000a      departments). In addition, the Community Relations Council (CRC) invited\u000a      Bryan to assist with the redrafting of policy (3) and in 2012, after\u000a      OFMDFM were unable to agree on a Cohesion, Sharing and Integration\u000a      policy, Bryan was asked to chair the FPRG under the auspices of the CRC to\u000a      produce new policy guidelines (3).\u000a    4.2 Influencing Government Action:\u000a      The research findings were discussed by the First Minister, Peter\u000a      Robinson, in the Northern Ireland Assembly in September 2009 and by the\u000a      Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness in November 2009. McGuiness\u000a      commented, `Queen's University has been involved in a number of surveys on\u000a      the issue since 2007. We appreciate the difficulties that the issue\u000a      presents in communities. Action has been taken to update our approach, and\u000a      I hope that the work of the review group will pay dividends for all of\u000a      us.' In September 2011 Robinson further identified the importance of the\u000a      monitoring process in terms of revising the Flags Protocol. On 11 October\u000a      2011 the `flags issue' was discussed in an emergency debate at the NI\u000a      Assembly. Five Members of the Local Assembly (MLA), from four different\u000a      political parties, referred to the research conclusions. Robin Newton,\u000a      Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA for East Belfast said, `I, like Dr\u000a      McDonnell and my colleague Sammy Douglas, want to pay tribute to the work\u000a      done by Queen's University in its report on the display of flags and\u000a      emblems in Northern Ireland. Without that piece of work, we would have\u000a      been unable to quantify the situation or determine what progress has been\u000a      made'. The impact of this research has led to the redrafting in 2012 (2,\u000a      7) of the 2005 multi-agency Protocols. In addition, the North Belfast Task\u000a      Force, chaired by OFMDFM advisors Gerry Kelly MLA and Jeffrey Donaldson MP\u000a      asked for a special report to be produced by Bryan and Kelly based on the\u000a      survey findings (2).\u000a    4.3 Changing Local Government Policy and Transforming Public\u000a        Attitudes:\u000a      Bryan worked with District Councils and peace and reconciliation groups to\u000a      help local groups engage more effectively with this highly contested\u000a      policy process. In 2012 further survey work and a report undertaken for\u000a      Armagh District Council and CRC (Grant 3) showed that over 90% of people\u000a      surveyed do not support flags flying on lampposts throughout the year. The\u000a      research findings resulted in a change of policy accepted by all political\u000a      parties in the Council (3). The research has played an important role in\u000a      community participation, particularly in rural areas (4 a, b, c). Bryan\u000a      has worked closely with the Rural Community Network (RCN) to engage with a\u000a      wide range of rural groups, using the research to inform a strategic\u000a      report on flags that was presented to OFMDFM (4b). `The most extensive and\u000a      far reaching of these projects has been the Transforming Conflict: Flags\u000a      and Emblems Project funded by OFMDFM and delivered by Bryan...at the\u000a      Institute for Irish Studies at Queen's University' (4c).\u000a    In addition, having worked with St Columb's Park House in\u000a      Derry\/Londonderry, the flags research model was used in Derry, Strabane,\u000a      Claudy, Limavady and Castlederg resulting in policy reports which have\u000a      also been submitted to the FPRG and enabled St Columb's Park house to work\u000a      more effectively on the North West Peace partnership and Peace Walls\u000a      Programme (5). Bryan has also consistently worked with Mediation Northern\u000a      Ireland on the issue to inform peace building work in Newry, Down and\u000a      Ballymena (6).\u000a    4.4 United Nations Engagement:\u000a      In May 2013, Bryan was asked to review a draft consultative document on\u000a      the use of flags and emblems produced by the Northern Ireland Human Rights\u000a      Commission. The research has been utilised in a UN paper Realising the\u000a        Human Right to Culture in Post-Conflict Societies. The UN report\u000a      quotes the flags research (from reference [6] above) in that it\u000a      `recognises the complexity of the local symbolic landscape and the role of\u000a      the peace process in intensifying `symbolic contestation' as `a\u000a        principal means for the two sides to express their difference' (8).\u000a      Following on from this United Nation's report, Bryan was invited by the UN\u000a      Special Rapporteur on Cultural Rights, Farida Shaheed, to join a panel of\u000a      international experts in Derry in July 2013, who provided comments on the\u000a      UN paper to be put to the UN Council. Experts made reference to the\u000a      significance of understanding the dilemmas of contested space from a broad\u000a      public perspective in specific national contexts such as the Northern\u000a      Ireland case\u000a    4.5 Challenging Public Debate:\u000a      The research has consistently informed public debate. The publication of\u000a      the 2009 report led to 226 citations in the press across Ireland and the\u000a      UK, including the BBC, Ulster Television (UTV), the Irish News and\u000a      Newsletter and a further 46 outlets after the 2011 report (9). In addition\u000a      to his many media appearances enumerated in the impact template, Bryan\u000a      engaged directly with the Minister for Justice in a forty minute radio\u000a      programme following riots in Ballyclare over the removal of flags (Radio\u000a      Ulster, 10 July 2013). In addition, Bryan curated an Exhibition (24 May -\u000a      10 June 2012) at the Naughton Gallery displaying 38 of the flags collected\u000a      during the research (10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In Northern Ireland the display of symbols in public spaces has remained\u000a      a highly contested and consistent cause of public disorder. The research\u000a      outlined in this case study is a leading Office of the First Minister and\u000a      Deputy First Minister Indicator for effective policies on community\u000a      relations. Impact is evidenced through the research in five ways.

In\u000a      Northern Ireland, disputes over flags and parades were centre stage as\u000a      severe violence erupted in the late 1960s. Identity conflicts have\u000a      continued to be marked by public symbols. Originating in ethnographic\u000a      research conducted by Dominic Bryan[1] before and after the 1998 Northern\u000a      Ireland peace agreement, this case study examines the nature, distribution\u000a      and effect of displays of political symbols, particularly flags, on the\u000a      streets of Northern Ireland.\u000a    Between 2002 and 2006, Bryan held an ESRC award (Grant 1) which explored\u000a      how public symbols changed in the period after the signing of the 1998\u000a      Multi-Party Agreement between the UK and Irish governments. This research\u000a      demonstrated how markers of public identity altered according to new\u000a      social and political circumstances in a series of ethnographic research\u000a      case studies detailing the use of (a) emblems and flags by public bodies;\u000a      (b) contested spaces and emblems during St Patrick's Day; and (c) at\u000a      civic\/political events.\u000a    The impact of this work led to a second period of research commissioned\u000a      by the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland\u000a      (OFMDFM) from 2006-2010 (Grant 2). Despite public awareness of political\u000a      sensitivities around display, the research showed that 4,000 flags on\u000a      average were still placed on the main roads of Northern Ireland every\u000a      year. Research demonstrated that, on the one hand, socio-political\u000a      transformations were taking place in new symbols for the Northern Ireland\u000a      Assembly with a recognition of changing identities e.g. in the new badge\u000a      for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) but that, on the other\u000a      hand, contestation in certain areas around the public flying of flags,\u000a      increased levels of conflict [2, 3, 4]. The research was graded `good' by\u000a      ESRC peer reviewers who commented that, `the quality of analysis was\u000a      generally excellent', `generating new knowledge and insights that in turn\u000a      are subject to rigorous social scientific analyses'. These research\u000a      findings have been referred to in Government reports, discussed in 4.1\u000a      below, as key indicators of the changing nature of conflicts over symbols\u000a      and space, first identified in the 1998 Multi-Party Agreement.\u000a    This 2006-2010 (OFMDFM) research specifically analysed the demarcation of\u000a      ethnic territory through displays of flags and emblems in public spaces.\u000a      Bryan developed (a) a mechanism for surveying all the arterial routes in\u000a      Northern Ireland over a 5 year period; (b) survey questions to test public\u000a      attitudes annually; and (c) five ethnographic case studies to give more\u000a      nuanced understandings of who puts flags up, when and why [5, 6]. The\u000a      research evaluated the on-going effectiveness of the Government's Shared\u000a        Future (2005) policy document and the multi-agency Joint\u000a        Protocol in Relation to Displays of Flags in Public Areas (2005) led\u000a      by the PSNI.\u000a    The research [7] provided clear evidence of how public space was\u000a      controlled using displays of flags, organised by young men with a\u000a      relationship to paramilitary groups. It showed that Government policy had\u000a      little impact on the numbers of flags displayed on main roads from\u000a      2006-2010; and that consistently over one-third of flags visible in July\u000a      remain flying after September but that there had been some reduction in\u000a      the display of paramilitary flags. The attitude surveys suggest that over\u000a      50% of people think that both the Union flags and the national flag of\u000a      Ireland are put up on lampposts by paramilitaries and that this makes\u000a      people less likely to use services and businesses in those areas.\u000a      Importantly, the research showed that flying of flags on lampposts does\u000a      not have widespread community support and that there is a commonly held\u000a      sense of threat around the displays. Results from this research were\u000a      confirmed by a more local level project carried out in Armagh City in 2012\u000a      funded by the Community Relations Council (CRC) (Grant 3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38410","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"617790","Name":"Moldova"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"630336","Name":"Belarus"},{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2464461","Name":"Tunisia"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has had a range of international governance, human rights\u000d\u000a      and legal opinion impacts.

It aims to have a positive impact on the way that assemblies are\u000d\u000a      controlled and monitored by police and has involved the following impacts\u000d\u000a      to date:\u000d\u000a    4.1 International Governance Impacts\u000d\u000a      In 2007, the ODIHR working group was transformed into a standing Expert\u000d\u000a      Panel on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly which Jarman was invited to chair,\u000d\u000a      initially for a five-year period. This appointment has been extended for a\u000d\u000a      further five years (2012-2016). The Panel has had ongoing responsibility\u000d\u000a      to promote and update the Guidelines of Freedom of Peaceful Assembly\u000d\u000a      and to improve public and legal understandings of and respect for this\u000d\u000a      human right. The initial draft of the Guidelines was co-authored by Jarman\u000d\u000a      for the OSCE\/ODIHR and in 2008 it was adopted by the Council of Europe's\u000d\u000a      European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission). The\u000d\u000a      ODIHR Expert Panel and the Venice Commission continue to work together on\u000d\u000a      issues relating to freedom of assembly, particularly on joint legal\u000d\u000a      Opinions, as well as further editions of the Guidelines. The Head of the\u000d\u000a      Human Rights Department of OSCE has noted that, `Mr. Jarman has\u000d\u000a      strengthened ODIHR's capacity to promote freedom of peaceful assembly and\u000d\u000a      contributed, also directly, to improved legal frameworks, strengthened\u000d\u000a      monitoring capacity of civil society and better practice of policing\u000d\u000a      assemblies in a number of OSCE participating States' [1].\u000d\u000a    4.2 Impacts upon Human Rights' Law\u000d\u000a      The Guidelines of Freedom of Peaceful Assembly have been cited by\u000d\u000a      the European Court of Human Rights as an authoritative source, most\u000d\u000a      recently in the case of Vyerentsov v. Ukraine (App.No 20372\/11) in April\u000d\u000a      2013; and also by the Polish Constitutional Court (case no 105\/6\/A\/2008,\u000d\u000a      in Polish). In both cases, the Guidelines provided essential research\u000d\u000a      evidence of best practices and key principles of freedom of assembly. The\u000d\u000a      courts made definitive rulings on the basis of the guidelines as the\u000d\u000a      criteria for maintaining international legal standards. They have also\u000d\u000a      been widely disseminated and cited in legal proceedings in other countries\u000d\u000a      (including Belarus and Russia) to promote understanding of issues relating\u000d\u000a      to freedom of assembly. As part of this process, they have been translated\u000d\u000a      into Russian, French and Arabic (to facilitate engagement with the Arab\u000d\u000a      Spring countries) and also into Armenian and Romanian. The Head of Legal\u000d\u000a      and Judicial Reform Advice in Armenia has advised that Jarman `made an\u000d\u000a      important and significant contribution' to the Guidelines which were used\u000d\u000a      as the foundational material for `drafting and adopting the new Armenian\u000d\u000a      Law on Freedom of Assemblies in 2011' [2].\u000d\u000a    The Guidelines were also widely cited as an authoritative source by the\u000d\u000a      UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of\u000d\u000a      association, in his first annual report published in 2012 (A\/HRC\/20\/27) in\u000d\u000a      which he noted the Guidelines as being, `the most advanced set of good\u000d\u000a      practices available' (see footnote 7 of his report) [3].\u000d\u000a    4.3 Impact through Legal Opinions and Human Rights' Monitoring\u000d\u000a    Jarman's research for the ODIHR Panel on Freedom of Assembly has also\u000d\u000a      involved:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Preparing legal Opinions on draft or existing laws relating to freedom\u000d\u000a        of assembly upon request from a representative of the government in the\u000d\u000a        relevant country. Since 2008, Jarman has co-authored Opinions on laws\u000d\u000a        for Armenia (June 2008 and December 2012); Sarajevo Canton (June 2010);\u000d\u000a        Serbia (October 2010); Ukraine (October 2010 and October 2011); Kyrgyz\u000d\u000a        Republic (May 2009 and December 2010); Belarus (March 2012); Poland (May\u000d\u000a        2012) and Tunisia (December 2012 and April 2013). In a number of cases,\u000d\u000a        the Opinions have resulted in amendments to draft or existing laws as\u000d\u000a        follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In April 2008, Jarman attended meetings with the Armenian government\u000d\u000a        at which he discussed changes that had been made to the law on\u000d\u000a        assemblies following large protests in March 2008. This advice resulted\u000d\u000a        in a further Opinion paper to the government which, in direct response,\u000d\u000a        agreed to repeal sections of the law and amend others, in particular,\u000d\u000a        providing for spontaneous or non-notified assemblies which had hitherto\u000d\u000a        been considered unlawful.\u000d\u000a      In November 2011, at a public event in Kiev, Jarman presented findings\u000d\u000a        of an ODIHR Opinion on a draft law on assemblies prepared by the\u000d\u000a        Ukrainian government. Partly in response to the critical Opinion, the\u000d\u000a        draft law was subsequently withdrawn and a third draft law text was\u000d\u000a        introduced into Parliament in July 2013.\u000d\u000a      Jarman's work with ODIHR on amendments to the Polish law on assemblies\u000d\u000a        in May 2012 resulted in an Opinion that led to a number of changes to\u000d\u000a        the draft law. These changes related to the removal of an increase in\u000d\u000a        the notification period prior to gatherings taking place and clarifying\u000d\u000a        the specific responsibilities and liabilities of the organiser in order\u000d\u000a        to make the law compliant with international human rights' standards.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In 2010-11, Jarman provided support and guidance to a working group\u000d\u000a        involving civil society representatives and government officials that\u000d\u000a        was set up by the Armenian Ombudsman to prepare a new law on Freedom of\u000d\u000a        Assembly for the Republic of Armenia. This resulted in a more liberal\u000d\u000a        law which was designed to comply with European standards and which came\u000d\u000a        into force in April 2011.\u000d\u000a      Jarman's comparative research on the monitoring of human rights in\u000d\u000a        South Africa, USA and Ireland led in 2008 to the development of a\u000d\u000a        research and training programme on monitoring freedom of assembly for\u000d\u000a        ODIHR. Jarman has since delivered this on behalf of ODIHR to human\u000d\u000a        rights' organisations in Moldova (2008); Armenia (2009); Kazakhstan\u000d\u000a        (2010); Kyrgystan (2011); Georgia (2011) and Serbia (2011). Research-led\u000d\u000a        training was designed to build capacity among civil society\u000d\u000a        organisations and was the prelude to a period (of between six months and\u000d\u000a        a year) of formal monitoring of assemblies to gather data for a\u000d\u000a        subsequent report. In each country the findings of the monitoring were\u000d\u000a        published in a research report, which was co-drafted by Jarman.\u000d\u000a        Subsequently, the research reports were used by OSCE\/ODIHR and the\u000d\u000a        national partner to begin a process of engagement with the government,\u000d\u000a        the police and municipal authorities as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In Moldova, the monitoring report was used to engage with the\u000d\u000a        municipal authority in the capital Chisinau to improve their\u000d\u000a        understanding and respect for the law; it was also used to engage with\u000d\u000a        the police as described in point 5 below.\u000d\u000a      In Armenia, the monitoring report provided an evidence base that was\u000d\u000a        used to inform the process of preparing the current law on assemblies\u000d\u000a        (as outlined in 2 above). It was also used as a means of engaging with\u000d\u000a        the municipality in Yerevan and the national police. The OSCE Mission in\u000d\u000a        Yerevan subsequently began a programme working with security forces in\u000d\u000a        monitoring and policing public assemblies.\u000d\u000a      In Kyrgyzstan, the monitoring report fed into (a) the wider process of\u000d\u000a        reforming the law on assemblies and (b) enabling the OSCE Mission in\u000d\u000a        Bishkek to work with civil society groups to increase awareness of how\u000d\u000a        this fundamental freedom was being respected.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In 2011 and 2012, Jarman's work impacted directly on capacity\u000d\u000a        building. He involved members of ODIHR staff in his research protocols\u000d\u000a        and practices enabling them to lead their own research programme in\u000d\u000a        relation to two specific types of assembly: Pride events and global\u000d\u000a        summits. This has resulted in an ODIHR report Monitoring of Freedom\u000d\u000a          of Peaceful Assembly in Selected OSCE Participating States (May 2011 - June 2012).\u000d\u000a\u0009\u0009  ODIHR has used the findings of this report to inform\u000d\u000a        their engagement with selected states and, in particular, with the\u000d\u000a        police (see point 7 below). Further research-based training of ODIHR\u000d\u000a        staff in March 2013 was undertaken to support a second cycle of assembly\u000d\u000a        monitoring which began in May 2013.\u000d\u000a      In Moldova, the research reports produced by the monitoring of\u000d\u000a        assemblies began a process of engagement with the police which resulted\u000d\u000a        in a 2010 research and training project on public order policing run by\u000d\u000a        CREDO, a Moldovan human rights organisation, and on which Jarman acted\u000d\u000a        as expert consultant.\u000d\u000a      In Armenia, Jarman's research undertaken on monitoring with the police\u000d\u000a        was adopted by the OSCE Mission in Armenia from 2009, which employed a\u000d\u000a        former UK police officer to develop a training programme in order to\u000d\u000a        address some of the issues raised by the research.\u000d\u000a      Jarman's overall research on monitoring led to a further OSCE\/ODIHR\u000d\u000a        programme initiative to produce a Handbook on Policing Public\u000d\u000a          Assemblies in March 2013. Jarman is a member of the project\u000d\u000a        advisory group. This guidance for police commanders is designed to\u000d\u000a        enable them to police assemblies under human rights' compliant\u000d\u000a        procedures.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    4.4 Impacts on UN Special Rapporteur Reporting\u000d\u000a      Research on freedom of assembly has led to changes in international legal\u000d\u000a      facilitation and judicial rulings through advice given to UN Special\u000d\u000a      Rapporteurs, as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In 2011, Jarman provided advice and assistance to the Special\u000d\u000a        Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, South\u000d\u000a        Africa for the latter's annual report to the United Nations which\u000d\u000a        focused on the use of force during public assemblies, (UN Report:\u000d\u000a        A\/HRC\/17\/28). Jarman's research was acknowledged in footnote 5 of the\u000d\u000a        report [4].\u000d\u000a      In November 2012, Jarman was invited to Kenya to meet the Special\u000d\u000a        Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association\u000d\u000a        to discuss and help frame issues to be included in his 2013 annual\u000d\u000a        report (UN Report A\/HRC\/23\/39). The Rapporteur noted that, `The work\u000d\u000a        that he and his colleagues do in the OSCE is clearly cutting edge' [5].\u000d\u000a      In January 2013, Jarman facilitated a number of meetings for the\u000d\u000a        Kenyan Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly\u000d\u000a        and of association as part of the latter's country visit to the UK. For\u000d\u000a        example, this included arranging meetings with members of local\u000d\u000a        communities to ensure that their views and concerns were reflected in\u000d\u000a        his report (UN Report A\/HRC\/23\/39\/Add.1) following outbreaks of violence\u000d\u000a        in a range of cities in the UK. In his first report to the Human Rights\u000d\u000a        Council in 2012, the Special Rapporteur noted that these were `the most\u000d\u000a        advanced' Guidelines available for consultation [5].\u000d\u000a      Nationally, the Guidelines have been used by organisations and\u000d\u000a        political leaders in their efforts to resolve disputes over public\u000d\u000a        assembly. For example, in 2013, the Police Service of Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a        used the Guidelines in their management of the protests around the G8\u000d\u000a        summit. The Guidelines have also been cited by The UK's Joint Committee\u000d\u000a        on Human Rights in their report Demonstrating Respect for Rights\u000d\u000a        (2008-09) and by The Equality and Human Rights Commission in the Human\u000a          Rights Review 2012.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study focuses on the right to assemble and to protest through\u000d\u000a      International human rights' law.

His research association\u000d\u000a      with the Unit dates to the mid-90s, and has been sustained ever since\u000d\u000a      through co-authorship and collaborative grant applications with staff\u000d\u000a      members and as a Category C submission to RAE. In 1995, his research\u000d\u000a      changed direction in response to growing national tensions, becoming\u000d\u000a      increasingly focused on socio-legal matters of regulation and management\u000d\u000a      of contested public events. Fieldwork involved personal observation at\u000d\u000a      numerous public gatherings along with extensive interviews with the public\u000d\u000a      and police. The research critically analysed how the right to assemble was\u000d\u000a      being utilised and policed, producing recommendations that have impacted\u000d\u000a      on public policy, institutional practice and understandings of the role of\u000d\u000a      human rights in social transformation.\u000d\u000a    In 1997, Jarman undertook a comparative study on the management of\u000d\u000a      assemblies in ten jurisdictions: Scotland, England, Ireland, USA, Canada,\u000d\u000a      South Africa, Italy, France, Israel and Palestine (funded by the Community\u000d\u000a      Relations Council, &#163;15,000). This was followed in 1998 by a comparative,\u000d\u000a      two-year practical research project on the policing of demonstrations and\u000d\u000a      public order in South Africa, Belgium and Northern Ireland (funded by the\u000d\u000a      Police Authority for Northern Ireland, &#163;60,000). This work focused on\u000d\u000a      developing an international comparative understanding of the issues of\u000d\u000a      implementing human rights and, in particular, the role of the police in\u000d\u000a      this process.\u000d\u000a    The published findings of Jarman's study of human rights and public\u000d\u000a      assembly conducted in 2001 for the Northern Ireland Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Commission were presented at a conference in Warsaw in 2004 organised by\u000d\u000a      the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, part of the\u000d\u000a      Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). He was\u000d\u000a      subsequently invited by them to participate in a working group to draft\u000d\u000a      guidelines on freedom of peaceful assembly. In 2007, following the\u000d\u000a      publication of the Guidelines, Jarman was invited to chair the newly\u000d\u000a      constituted `Expert Panel on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly'\u000d\u000a        http:\/\/www.osce.org\/odihr\/43618.\u000d\u000a    Jarman's research with ODIHR has involved fieldwork and critical analysis\u000d\u000a      of law and practice relating to freedom of assembly across Europe and\u000d\u000a      countries of the former Soviet Union. It has highlighted issues around the\u000d\u000a      use of permit systems, a lack of respect for spontaneous assemblies,\u000d\u000a      excessive use of force and a lack of awareness and accountability for\u000d\u000a      human rights' principles internationally. He has conducted research on\u000d\u000a      human rights' violations in many countries, including, Belarus, Russia,\u000d\u000a      Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, as well as the UK, France and the\u000d\u000a      USA. The research has provided an evidence base for work with human\u000d\u000a      rights' groups and it has impacted upon governments and police forces by\u000d\u000a      changing laws, attitudes and actions in implementing this fundamental\u000d\u000a      democratic freedom.\u000d\u000a    The initial text of the Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly\u000d\u000a      was published in English and Russian in 2007 and since 2008 its\u000d\u000a      recommendations have been widely promoted and disseminated as a guide to\u000d\u000a      best practice internationally. The book has been translated into Arabic,\u000d\u000a      Armenian, French, Georgian and Romanian. A revised and extended edition\u000d\u000a      was published in 2010 and a third edition is under preparation. OSCE's\u000d\u000a      Head of Democratization has noted that the guidelines have `helped shape\u000d\u000a      public opinion and policy', (pers. comm.).\u000d\u000a    The research has also resulted in the development and delivery of a\u000d\u000a      programme that trains human rights' groups to carry out field research to\u000d\u000a      monitor, analyse and report on how freedom of assembly is being addressed\u000d\u000a      in different countries. This training was initially based on ethnographic\u000d\u000a      fieldwork methods developed by Jarman in Ireland, South Africa and the USA\u000d\u000a      in the late 1990s, and has been revised based on his further research, in\u000d\u000a      particular, in Armenia and Moldova between 2007 and 2009.

This situation stifled\u000a      the study of religion, just\u000a      at the time when religious dynamics in the region were in need of robust\u000a      and critical analysis.\u000a    Against this background, Pelkmans has contributed to the training of a\u000a      new generation of local\u000a      scholars, exposing them to cutting-edge research on religion (his own\u000a      included), introducing them\u000a      to innovative research methodologies, and mentoring them in a critical\u000a      approach to the social\u000a      sciences. Starting in 2008, Pelkmans has worked closely with Social\u000a      Science Departments in three\u000a      Universities (in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia), has provided prolonged\u000a      academic and\u000a      professional guidance to eleven scholars from Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan,\u000a      Kazakhstan, Georgia, and\u000a      Armenia, and has given personal consultations and feedback on the research\u000a      projects and written\u000a      works of approximately fifty scholars from across the region. He has\u000a      undertaken this work under\u000a      the aegis of the Open Society Foundations (OSF), which recruited him\u000a      because of his pioneering\u000a      research on post-Soviet religious change. He was involved in three\u000a      specific programmes: the\u000a      Academic Fellowship Program (AFP), the Regional Seminar for Excellence in\u000a      Teaching (ReSET),\u000a      and the Central Asian and Caucasus Research and Teaching Initiative\u000a      (CARTI). His activities and\u000a      their impact are described in more detail below.\u000a    Capacity-building with Institutions of Higher Education: Pelkmans\u000a      has worked with The American\u000a      University of Central Asia (AUCA) in Kyrgyzstan, The Tbilisi State\u000a      University in Georgia, and The\u000a      National University of Mongolia to help develop the teaching and research\u000a      profile of their Social\u000a      Science Departments, especially in the field of Anthropology. For example,\u000a      while serving at AUCA\u000a      as an `International Scholar' between 2008 and 2013, Pelkmans assisted the\u000a      Anthropology\u000a      Department in making a radical shift in its curriculum away from its\u000a      traditional and narrow focus on\u000a      Kyrgyz folklore and towards a more critical engagement with wider and\u000a      contemporary societal\u000a      issues such as development, migration, globalization, and, importantly,\u000a      religious change [A,B].\u000a      According to Dr. Elmira Shishkaraeva, AFP Regional Manager for Central\u000a      Asia and Mongolia, \"Dr.\u000a      Mathijs Pelkmans played a key role in designing, structuring and\u000a      descri[bing] the concept of `three\u000a      tracks'...1) History and Archeology, 2) Culture and Identity, and 3)\u000a      Development Studies\", which\u000a      now form the structure for the department [A]. In addition, Pelkmans\u000a      helped design a new\u000a      undergraduate degree offering a wide range of courses across these three\u000a      tracks [D].\u000a    Training anthropologists: Between 2010 and 2013, Pelkmans served\u000a      as a `core faculty' member of\u000a      the Regional Seminar for Excellence in Teaching (ReSET), a three year\u000a      training programme\u000a      attended by 25 (mostly junior) lecturers from universities throughout the\u000a      former Soviet Union [E].\u000a      Participants were trained in the practice of ethnographic research, with a\u000a      thematic focus on\u000a      `Contemporary Anthropological Approaches to Religion and Secularism', for\u000a      which several of\u000a      Pelkmans's own publications [1, 2, 3, 7] were used as course material.\u000a      Pelkmans gave a total of 12\u000a      lectures, held private consultative sessions with participants on their\u000a      research and teaching\u000a      activities, and moderated a number of discussion groups. In addition, he\u000a      delivered training\u000a      sessions on teaching skills, academic writing, and publishing.\u000a    Professor Ketevan Khutsishvili at Tbilisi State University in Georgia\u000a      observed that Pelkmans'\u000a      \"lectures, seminars, and workshops were very well received because they\u000a      helped the scholars to\u000a      move ahead in their own research projects and their teaching\" [F]. Some\u000a      programme participants\u000a      introduced new courses in their home universities on the Anthropology of\u000a      Religion and designed\u000a      and carried out their own research projects in this area. Dr. Emil\u000a      Nasritdinov describes the impact\u000a      at AUCA: \"Mathijs helped us to strengthen our teaching on a range of\u000a      topics in anthropology, such\u000a      as development, political anthropology, migration, and especially\u000a      religion. Over the years he has\u000a      given my colleagues and me individual feedback on course syllabi and held\u000a      consultations to further\u000a      develop them. In my own case, Mathijs helped me to put together the course\u000a      on development and\u000a      he provided helpful input in the course on religion. Moreover, through\u000a      giving guest lectures (five\u000a      times in my courses), and two workshops with our faculty on teaching\u000a      practices, he gave us many\u000a      ideas for research-led teaching\" [B].\u000a    Mentoring anthropologists: Pelkmans has also acted as an\u000a      International Scholar in the context of\u000a      the AFP programme [G]. The aim of this programme is to partner\u000a      International with Returning\u000a      Scholars, to enhance the latter's academic research and publication\u000a      profile and, more generally, to\u000a      increase their international exposure and reputation [H]. As\u000a      `International Scholar' for the OSF's\u000a      Central Asia Research and Training Initiative (CARTI) (2007-2009,\u000a      2011-2014), Pelkmans\u000a      provided research supervision of Ph.D. students and university lecturers\u000a      in Tashkent (Uzbekistan),\u000a      Tbilisi (Georgia), Yerevan (Armenia), and Astana (Kazakhstan).\u000a    Beyond this, Pelkmans has continued to mentor five anthropologists\u000a      working at American\u000a      University of Central Asia in Kyrgyzstan. As a result, articles by these\u000a      scholars have been\u000a      published in such peer-reviewed journals as Ab Imperio [I] and Transnational\u000a        Social Review [J].\u000a      Pelkmans's mentoring role has been instrumental in bringing the articles\u000a      to publishable quality,\u000a      thereby enhancing the reputation and authority of the scholars involved\u000a      [B,H]. Professor Emil\u000a      Nasritdinov believes that \"These types of collaboration are particularly\u000a      important in our department,\u000a      given that most of our faculty is relatively junior and developing their\u000a      skills as researchers and\u000a      writers...I believe that it is through his example, his encouragement and\u000a      his constructive criticism\u000a      for quite a few years, he is making an important contributing [sic] in\u000a      helping our department to raise\u000a      its research profile as a whole\" [B].\u000a    Pelkmans was also appointed Facilitator of the Anthropology Disciplinary\u000a      Group of the AFP (2011-\u000a      2013), which involved playing a central role in linking anthropologists to\u000a      scholars elsewhere and\u000a      coordinating the content of three-day study meetings held twice a year. In\u000a      this capacity he initiated\u000a      a collaboration between Returning Scholars in AUCA and the National\u000a      University of Mongolia by\u000a      facilitating exchanges between the two departments. This led to a unique\u000a      collaborative writing\u000a      project on `Post-Communist Spirituality' to which each scholar is\u000a      submitting an article and which\u000a      will be submitted as a collection for a special issue of the journal Inner\u000a        Asia (co-edited by Sneath\u000a      and Pelkmans) later in 2013 [H]. According to Serhiy Zaitsev, OSF's\u000a      Regional Manager, \"The role\u000a      of Dr. Pelkmans is indispensable in this process, as he regularly coaches\u000a      the scholars in rigourous\u000a      research methods, appropriate academic writing style, and effective\u000a      publication strategies. All this\u000a      greatly contributes to local academic capacity building in general and,\u000a      more specifically, to the\u000a      seven Returning Scholars becoming reputable, internationally-known\u000a      researchers\" [H]. Because of\u000a      this \"productive long-term collaboration\" [A], Pelkmans was asked to\u000a      support scholars writing for a\u000a      special issue on post-Soviet industrial towns in another collaboration\u000a      involving OSF, AUCA and the\u000a      Center for Independent Social Research of the Russian Federation.\u000a    Improving capacity-building programmes: In 2012 Pelkmans was asked\u000a      by the Open Society\u000a      Foundations to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the Academic\u000a      Fellowship Program, which\u000a      had been active in 18 countries since 2004. He was asked to outline a\u000a      strategy for how its\u000a      effectiveness could be enhanced within, and extended beyond, the regions\u000a      of the former Soviet\u000a      Union [K]. Co-authored with the former US Ambassador to Georgia and\u000a      Belarus, the evaluation\u000a      was informed by Pelkmans' own experience as an International Scholar and\u000a      included a\u000a      comprehensive set of programme benchmarks for guiding and assessing future\u000a      progress. The\u000a      report was positively received by AFP's Academic Advisory Council, and its\u000a      recommendation for\u000a      geographic expansion are already being implemented through pilot projects\u000a      in Burma, Tunisia, and\u000a      Sierra Leone. In addition, in 2011 Pelkmans served as `Consultant' at\u000a      OSF's `Fellows Orientation\u000a      and Research Design Workshop' of the Central Asia Research and Teaching\u000a      Initiative (CARTI),\u000a      held in Istanbul.\u000a    Overall impact: In terms of the overall impact of Pelkmans'\u000a      involvement in the former Soviet Union,\u000a      Dr. Emil Nasritdinov observed that \"I think I speak also for my colleagues\u000a      when I state that the\u000a      ultimate value of Mathijs' engagement has been to intensify dialogue\u000a      between different research,\u000a      educational, and broadly scholarly traditions, and thereby to facilitate\u000a      our own efforts to develop a\u000a      discipline which is relatively new in Central Asia. It is important that\u000a      his involvement was not\u000a      restricted to a few visits, but has been on-going for almost five years,\u000a      and will continue in the\u000a      foreseeable future. It has been through sharing his expertise in teaching\u000a      and in research that\u000a      Mathijs has made his contribution\" [B]. Clearly, these scholarly\u000a      activities do not produce\u000a      instantaneous effects that can be precisely measured; they are nonetheless\u000a      crucial to a future\u000a      generation of social scientists, who will themselves have impact on the\u000a      religious dynamics at play\u000a      in their region, e.g., through more nuanced and critically engaged\u000a      discussions of religious\u000a      phenomena in their classrooms or through rigorous empirical studies of\u000a      religious phenomena.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    LSE research has contributed to institutional capacity building and to\u000a      the renewal of the study of\u000a      religion in the former Soviet Union. More specifically, the LSE\u000a      anthropologist Mathijs Pelkmans has\u000a      contributed to the training of a new generation of local scholars in\u000a      Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and\u000a      Mongolia; he has helped introduce these scholars to contemporary research\u000a      and to innovative\u000a      methodologies, and has mentored them in critical social science.

He\u000a      has shown that religious\u000a      formations are flexible and contingent on political and economic\u000a      processes, and that religious\u000a      experience goes through phases of intensification and weakening, thereby\u000a      challenging prevalent\u000a      views of religious change in the region. More specifically, his\u000a      publications address the three\u000a      following areas of inquiry:\u000a    Pelkmans [1, 2, 3] address the problematic return of Islam to the public\u000a      sphere in a Muslim-majority region of the Republic of Georgia, and the intensification of the\u000a      process of conversion from\u000a      Islam to Christianity. During the Soviet period, Islam came to have\u000a      negative associations and\u000a      Orthodox Christianity came to have \"primordial\" associations; in a newly\u000a      independent Georgia,\u000a      these associations have been further reinforced. These publications show\u000a      that conversion from\u000a      Islam to Orthodox Christianity in this context should be understood as an\u000a      attempt to realign history\u000a      and community with a strong sense of national identity.\u000a    Pelkmans [4] and McBrien and Pelkmans [5] report the findings of a\u000a      research project conducted in\u000a      the Republic of Kyrgyzstan on missionary encounters and dynamics of\u000a      conversion. After the\u000a      collapse of the Soviet Union, the country had become increasingly\u000a      attractive to foreign religious\u000a      missions. The research analysed this emerging mission field and theorized\u000a      the nature of\u000a      conversion in a `post-atheist' setting. By seeing conversion as a form of\u000a      movement in which\u000a      religious and social boundaries are both crossed and created, the\u000a      resulting publications\u000a      demonstrate how conversion dynamics in post-Soviet contexts are entwined\u000a      with the themes of\u000a      modernity, morality, and inequality.\u000a    Finally, Pelkmans [1] and Hann and Pelkmans [6] discuss the topics of\u000a      doubt and ambiguity,\u000a      arguing that while religious and secular convictions can have powerful\u000a      effects, their fundaments\u000a      are often surprisingly fragile. In order to understand more fully the role\u000a      of ideas in social action, one\u000a      has therefore to take into account how doubt can be repressed (in order to\u000a      produce conviction) and\u000a      how belief-systems collapse. Pelkmans has developed this analytical\u000a      perspective to explain the\u000a      temporary appeal of religious nationalism and Pentecostal Christianity. He\u000a      has also given\u000a      numerous lectures and talks on these topics, and completed an edited\u000a      volume titled Ethnographies\u000a        of Doubt (2013) [7].\u000a    KEY RESEARCHER: Pelkmans has been employed as Lecturer in the\u000a      Department of\u000a      Anthropology since 2007 and as Senior Lecturer since 2011.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39068","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2403846","Name":"Sierra Leone"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The special issue evidenced concerns noted by the `Committee on World\u000d\u000a      Food Security' of the UN\u000d\u000a      `High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition' when\u000d\u000a      reporting on `Land tenure and\u000d\u000a      international investments in agriculture', acknowledging how conservation\u000d\u000a      policy generates strong\u000d\u000a      pressures to set aside land in ways that can be understood as a land grab\u000d\u000a      in the name of the\u000d\u000a      environment &#8212; `a new way of appropriation of nature' [see Section 5, C1].\u000d\u000a      It also helped to\u000d\u000a      stimulate and set agendas for a major gathering in 2013 of conservation\u000d\u000a      professionals on\u000d\u000a      `Conservation and Land Grabbing: Part of the Problem or Part of the\u000d\u000a      Solution?', jointly organised\u000d\u000a      by the International Institute for Environment and Development, the\u000d\u000a      International Land Coalition,\u000d\u000a      the Zoological Society of London, and Maliasili Initiatives, and drew\u000d\u000a      together international\u000d\u000a      conservation organisations (UNEP, IUCN, Conservation International, Fauna\u000d\u000a      and Flora\u000d\u000a      International, Bird Life, World Resources Institute, RSPB, DfID) and the\u000d\u000a      national conservation\u000d\u000a      organisations of Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya.

These networks\u000d\u000a      included the POLEX\u000d\u000a      network of the UN-Mandated Centre for International Forestry that networks\u000d\u000a      forestry and\u000d\u000a      conservation professionals globally, the PRESA network of the World\u000d\u000a      Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF),\u000d\u000a      mandated with `generating and sharing knowledge to build capacity on\u000d\u000a      Payments for Ecosystem\u000d\u000a      Services in Africa and beyond', and aid organisations such as\u000d\u000a      Welthungerhilfe [C4]. Lobby groups\u000d\u000a      such as `Carbon Trade Watch' and the Washington-based `Transnational\u000d\u000a      Institute' (www.tni.org),\u000d\u000a      incorporated the message (e.g. in TNI's influential primer on `The global\u000d\u000a      land grab' [C5]).\u000d\u000a    In addition to policy critique and reformulation, Fairhead's research\u000d\u000a      into AfDE offers a sustainable\u000d\u000a      indigenous alternative to the potentially `green-grabbing' biochar\u000d\u000a      industry and policy. Fairhead\u000d\u000a      disseminated technical ideas widely (e.g. a feature in `New Scientist');\u000d\u000a      a presentation at the UK's\u000d\u000a      Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on debates and innovation\u000d\u000a      networks, which helped\u000d\u000a      develop their roadmap for `biogenic carbon sequestration' [C6]. But to\u000d\u000a      gain global reach, Fairhead\u000d\u000a      developed a collaborative research team that included as Co-I the\u000d\u000a      world-leading biochar soil\u000d\u000a      scientists at Cornell, and Johannes Lehman, the co-founder and chair of\u000d\u000a      the `International Biochar\u000d\u000a      Initiative' that supports `researchers, commercial entities,\u000d\u000a      policy-makers, farmers and gardeners,\u000d\u000a      development agents and others committed to sustainable biochar production\u000d\u000a      and use'. This\u000d\u000a      generated an immediate policy and business audience, and integrated\u000d\u000a      Fairhead's AfDE research\u000d\u000a      within partnerships between Cornell and African agronomic research and\u000d\u000a      development (e.g. the\u000d\u000a      CARE\u000d\u000a        and Cornell partnership).\u000d\u000a    Fairhead's AfDE research team, including Dawit Solomon of Cornell,\u000d\u000a      initiated a vibrant dialogue\u000d\u000a      concerning AfDE within `biochar' networks and collaborations crossing the\u000d\u000a      soil-science and\u000d\u000a      agricultural-policy communities in Africa and beyond (e.g. the CGIAR\u000d\u000a      Climate Change and Food\u000d\u000a      Security programme; the BIODEV programme of the World Agroforestry Centre;\u000d\u000a      the EU BeBi\u000d\u000a      project; the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA),\u000d\u000a      International Centre for Tropical\u000d\u000a      Agriculture (CIAT), and research groups at the Swedish University of\u000d\u000a      Agricultural Sciences (SLU)\u000d\u000a      and Wageningen Agricultural University). This was facilitated and\u000d\u000a      sustained in workshops and e-\u000d\u000a      networking (e.g. the `Biochar Africa' inaugural conference, Kenya 2013,\u000d\u000a      disseminating to IITA,\u000d\u000a      ICRAF, CIAT, Re-char Kenya; the CARE\/Cornell workshops linking them with\u000d\u000a      IITA and Sierra\u000d\u000a      Leone researchers in Freetown, 2013).\u000d\u000a    The research and dialogue has prompted some funders to switch their\u000d\u000a      initial focus on biochar, and\u000d\u000a      adopt AfDE instead as their model, and develop practices to\u000d\u000a      mimic\/accelerate AfDE formation.\u000d\u000a      Thus the McKnight Foundation, which previously funded a `biochar' project\u000d\u000a      supported by Cornell\u000d\u000a      and Jimma University in Ethiopia, for example, has now transformed into an\u000d\u000a      `indigenous fertiliser'\u000d\u000a      programme and conducted field trials of mixes of locally sourced soil\u000d\u000a      additives that overtly mimic\u000d\u000a      AfDE and which outperform normal fertiliser. Pilot trials conducted in\u000d\u000a      2012-13 are to be expanded\u000d\u000a      into major regional trials in Ethiopia, and provide a model for an\u000d\u000a      AfDE-inspired `indigenous fertiliser'\u000d\u000a      movement on the continent. This is directly attributable to Fairhead's\u000d\u000a      ESRC research and the\u000d\u000a      energy of his collaborators, Solomon and Lehman [C7].\u000d\u000a    Agricultural trials of AfDE-inspired `indigenous fertiliser' are also\u000d\u000a      being developed in Sierra Leone\u000d\u000a      after Fairhead co-conducted preliminary research with an EU-funded `Food\u000d\u000a      Security and Economic\u000d\u000a      Development' project supported by Deutsche-Welthungerhilfe, and linked\u000d\u000a      with Njala University\u000d\u000a      College [C8]. This revealed the major importance of AfDE for agroforests\u000d\u000a      (oil palm, cocoa, coffee). A\u000d\u000a      further project with Njala Agricultural University (Sierra Leone, January\u000d\u000a      2011-December 2011)\u000d\u000a      determined the prevalence, formation and use of these soils. Now the\u000d\u000a      collaboration is seeking to\u000d\u000a      develop trials to mimic their formation in order to improve agricultural\u000d\u000a      production and sequester\u000d\u000a      carbon, whilst avoiding green grabs.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Fairhead and his colleagues questioned new market approaches to\u000d\u000a      environmental sustainability,\u000d\u000a      warning of their iniquitous distributional effects, dubbed\u000d\u000a      `green-grabbing'.

A debate on `land-grabbing' already\u000d\u000a      highlights instances where\u000d\u000a      `green' credentials justify appropriations of land for food or fuel (e.g.\u000d\u000a      to `alleviate pressure on\u000d\u000a      forests'). Yet Fairhead et al. reveal how environmental green\u000d\u000a      agendas are themselves now core\u000d\u000a      drivers depriving people of land and rights &#8212; whether linked to\u000d\u000a      biodiversity conservation, biocarbon\u000d\u000a      sequestration, biofuels, ecosystem services, ecotourism or `offsets'\u000d\u000a      related to these. In some cases\u000d\u000a      `green-grabbing' is more subtle, reducing land access or restricting its\u000d\u000a      use. Green-grabbing has\u000d\u000a      roots in well-known histories of environmental displacement (for parks,\u000d\u000a      forest reserves) but the new\u000d\u000a      market mechanisms to address environmental problems have drawn an\u000d\u000a      extraordinary new range\u000d\u000a      of actors and alliances into this process (e.g. pension funds, venture\u000d\u000a      capitalists, commodity traders\u000d\u000a      and consultants, GIS service-providers, ecotourism companies, the\u000d\u000a      military, green activists and\u000d\u000a      anxious consumers). As nature becomes `capital', it attracts enclosure and\u000d\u000a      consolidation; new\u000d\u000a      appropriations of nature with implications for ecologies and livelihoods.\u000d\u000a    Fairhead et al''s case study examined how global interest and\u000d\u000a      markets in carbon offsetting have\u000d\u000a      driven interests in `biochar' technologies as an apparent `win-win' but\u000d\u000a      have drawn attention away\u000d\u000a      from the potential of `Anthropogenic Dark Earths' (ADE). Biochar (charcoal\u000d\u000a      produced by incomplete\u000d\u000a      combustion of vegetation, sometimes in biomass energy processes) is newly\u000d\u000a      understood to be a\u000d\u000a      soil conditioner that can sequester atmospheric CO2 whilst\u000d\u000a      restoring soil carbon and fertility.\u000d\u000a      Modern attention to biochar, however, emerged from the appreciation of ADE\u000d\u000a      (soils transformed by\u000d\u000a      the long-term, intensive waste deposition associated with indigenous\u000d\u000a      domestic and farming\u000d\u000a      practices) that are rich in biochar, but a lot more besides. Global\u000d\u000a      concern to sequester carbon and\u000d\u000a      the associated new carbon markets is biasing research and policies in\u000d\u000a      these promising\u000d\u000a      technologies towards the `biochar', occluding attention to the larger\u000d\u000a      potential fertility benefits that\u000d\u000a      likely will derive from mimicking ADE.\u000d\u000a    These findings derive from two research initiatives. First, Fairhead's\u000d\u000a      Leverhulme grant The Dark\u000d\u000a        Earth Phenomenon: Sustainable Agriculture for Amazonia and Beyond?\u000d\u000a      (&#163;54,000) enabled\u000d\u000a      doctoral student James Fraser to discern how modern farmers in Amazonian\u000d\u000a      Brazil use\u000d\u000a      Amazonian Dark Earths. These initially poor soils are improved enduringly\u000d\u000a      by the deposition of\u000d\u000a      everyday wastes over centuries, enriching them with biochar AND many other\u000d\u000a      organic and\u000d\u000a      inorganic materials which alter soil quality so that, hundreds (thousands)\u000d\u000a      of years later, they remain\u000d\u000a      capable of intensive use. Fairhead then developed research hypothesising\u000d\u000a      the presence of\u000d\u000a      Amazonian Dark Earths in Africa? (ESRC &#163;450,000), and conducted\u000d\u000a      this with international co-\u000d\u000a      investigators from Ghana, Guinea and Cornell (USA). They established (for\u000d\u000a      the first time) that West\u000d\u000a      African farmers already create and value ADE.\u000d\u000a    So, whilst `biochar' programmes are being rolled out in Africa to\u000d\u000a      encourage African smallholders to\u000d\u000a      sequester global carbon by adding biochar to their soil, such additives\u000d\u000a      are not an entirely novel\u000d\u000a      aspect in African farming. But carbon markets are driving interests in\u000d\u000a      biochar at the expense of\u000d\u000a      researching African Dark Earth (AfDE) approaches, and are threatening\u000d\u000a      large-scale `green-grabs'\u000d\u000a      for biochar feedstocks and in land consolidation associated with economies\u000d\u000a      of scale &#8212; rather than\u000d\u000a      building on socially and ecologically appropriate AfDE practices. Further,\u000d\u000a      the loud voice now\u000d\u000a      criticising biochar for its distributional effects risks throwing the baby\u000d\u000a      of AfDE out with its bathwater.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40384","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Through its findings, the research has:\u000d\u000a    A. Put the needs of the Chinese community back on the Government's\u000d\u000a        agenda: The CIBF was established in 1996 as a response to the Home\u000d\u000a      Office Select Affairs 1985 Committee Report \"The Chinese in Britain\".\u000d\u000a      However, during the 2000s, much public and third sector attention switched\u000d\u000a      from race\/ethnicity to faith-based organisations, leaving CIBF in a\u000d\u000a      relatively marginalized position. This was not helped by the Chinese\u000d\u000a      community's reputation and willingness to project itself as a `model'\u000d\u000a      migrant community that was not in need of support. The project and the\u000d\u000a      subsequent report enabled CIBF to re-establish a relationship with\u000d\u000a      governmental institutions, in particular the Department for Communities\u000d\u000a      and Local Government (DCLG), the former Minister for Social Cohesion,\u000d\u000a      Shahid Malik MP, as well as the former Big Society advisor, Lord Nat Wei.\u000d\u000a      As a consequence of the report launching 2009 &#8212; which Shahid Malik\u000d\u000a      attended &#8212; CIBF was asked to present results from the research to senior\u000d\u000a      DCLG policy officials at a workshop. Also as a result of the report,\u000d\u000a      Communities Minister Andrew Stunell convened a roundtable meeting in\u000d\u000a      November 2010 for members of the Chinese community, enabling them to\u000d\u000a      explore matters of concern with DCLG. Finally, despite changes in\u000d\u000a      government, CIBF has managed to maintain a relationship with the DCLG,\u000d\u000a      which would not have been possible without the report [A]. The research\u000d\u000a      and publications have given CIBF an empirical basis for approaching\u000d\u000a      policy-makers, thus helping it fulfil its mission to strategically\u000d\u000a      identify and respond to the needs of the Chinese community, to promote\u000d\u000a      these interests to government, and to encourage the community's active\u000d\u000a      civic participation in British society.\u000d\u000a    B. Strengthened the hand of the local government to gain more\u000d\u000a        resources: The report was distributed to over 200 Local Authorities\u000d\u000a      and Westminster City Council used it to improve the collection of census\u000d\u000a      data in 2011 [B]. It did this by sharing the findings with the Office for\u000d\u000a      National Statistics (ONS) and pushing for more resources to increase\u000d\u000a      engagement with the Chinese Community and to better tackle cultural and\u000d\u000a      linguistic issues. As a result, ONS committed additional resources to\u000d\u000a      train interviewers, and provide community support and comprehensive\u000d\u000a      training on cultural sensitivity. One new census officer was given a\u000d\u000a      specific remit for the Chinese community for the 2011 census. The report\u000d\u000a      has strengthened Westminster City Council's ongoing efforts to highlight\u000d\u000a      the specific challenges of this particularly diverse London borough and\u000d\u000a      has enhanced its commitment to pioneering innovative approaches to\u000d\u000a      understanding the needs of Westminster's population.\u000d\u000a    C. Focused the need for Third Sector organisations within the Chinese\u000d\u000a        community to provide better support for new migrants: By\u000d\u000a      highlighting differences between the needs of new and older migrants, and\u000d\u000a      by demonstrating that many third sector organisations effectively exclude\u000d\u000a      the former, the report has accentuated the need for Chinese community\u000d\u000a      organisations to cater for these newcomers. It also legitimated the\u000d\u000a      proposal that CIBF lead the formation of a new group of Chinese\u000d\u000a      third-sector providers, supported by DCLG, although this was delayed by\u000d\u000a      the change in government.\u000d\u000a    The report has been cited and used widely:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      A number of other Chinese organisations cite the report as evidence of\u000d\u000a        the changing needs of the Chinese community in Britain and of the new\u000d\u000a        challenges confronted by the Chinese community, third sector providers\u000d\u000a        and political representatives [D].\u000d\u000a      The Chinese Information and Advice Centre (CIAC) has used the report\u000d\u000a        to legitimate its existence, challenge assumptions about its clients and\u000d\u000a        advocate for its service users [C].\u000d\u000a      Migrants Rights Network [E] cites the report to illustrate the\u000d\u000a        significant problems faced by many new Chinese migrants to the UK in\u000d\u000a        accessing public services and earning decent wages. This is exacerbated\u000d\u000a        by restrictive immigration policies towards migrant workers, students\u000d\u000a        and undocumented migrants.\u000d\u000a      As a result of the report, CIBF has been invited to become advisory\u000d\u000a        members of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Ethnicity and Poverty\u000d\u000a        Programme [A], and has consequently changed the group's perspective on\u000d\u000a        the issues facing Chinese community. The report has been cited in their\u000d\u000a        publications [F].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    D. Raised the profile of issues facing the Chinese community in\u000d\u000a        London: Extensive media coverage on the launch of the report, in\u000d\u000a      China [H] and in Chinese language media in Europe [I,J,K,L], has drawn\u000d\u000a      attention to the needs of Chinese migrants in the UK and raised the\u000d\u000a      profile of CIBF. The report earned the prestigious Market Research\u000d\u000a      Society's first Virginia Valentine Award for Cultural Insight in 2011.\u000d\u000a      Judges commended the report for overcoming \"...the huge linguistic and\u000d\u000a      cultural barriers and the problems of accurately identifying communities\u000d\u000a      and sub-communities.

They served on the Advisory Group of\u000d\u000a      the ESRO research team throughout, starting with the design and\u000d\u000a      implementation of the research all the way through to data analysis, the\u000d\u000a      writing of the report (Migration, Integration, Cohesion: New Chinese\u000d\u000a        Migrants in London:\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.chinesemigration.org.uk\/pages\/en\/download1.html)\u000d\u000a      and the dissemination of its findings from 2009 onwards.\u000d\u000a    Feuchtwang and Stafford were approached to undertake this sensitive\u000d\u000a      project because of their track record in academic research on Chinese\u000d\u000a      society and culture (from 1995 onwards) and their experience of long-term\u000d\u000a      fieldwork in China &#8212; a fact explicitly acknowledged by CIBF. Specifically,\u000d\u000a      Feuchtwang was consulted because of his expertise in Chinese communities &#8212;\u000d\u000a      and in particular in social support mechanisms and leadership. His work on\u000d\u000a      family disruption [1,2] showed that members of disrupted families,\u000d\u000a      dislocated from rural to urban Taiwan, maintained links with their place\u000d\u000a      of origin if they could afford it, while simultaneously making their new\u000d\u000a      place of residence a `home', developing new aspirations and learning new\u000d\u000a      ways of operating. His work on local leaders in China and Taiwan [3]\u000d\u000a      showed that their followers' loyalty depended on the leaders' capacity to\u000d\u000a      get things done, and that this had significant implications for community\u000d\u000a      cohesion. Stafford's expertise was sought because of his work on, among\u000d\u000a      other things, the social consequences of separation within families and\u000d\u000a      wider communities, a topic of particular relevance to studies of migration\u000d\u000a      [4,5]. He showed the importance of what Chinese call \"social capacity\" &#8212;\u000d\u000a      the knowledge needed to maintain networks of relationships, locally and\u000d\u000a      across distances of separation. Equally relevant is his work on Chinese\u000d\u000a      collective identity and the moral\/ethical imperative for members of\u000d\u000a      communities to look after each other [6,7]. Stafford's research provides\u000d\u000a      the baseline against which to appreciate the extra strain confronted by\u000d\u000a      Chinese migrants to London as they face a radically different social\u000d\u000a      environment.\u000d\u000a    Another key reason why Feuchtwang and Stafford were approached by ESRO is\u000d\u000a      that the research commissioned by CIBF presented unique methodological\u000d\u000a      challenges, due to the poor English language skills of many migrants, the\u000d\u000a      cultural barriers that made some research methods (surveys\/focus groups)\u000d\u000a      problematic and the difficulties related to accessing vulnerable or\u000d\u000a      undocumented communities. To meet these challenges the research team\u000d\u000a      relied on Feuchtwang's and Stafford's long experience in ethnographic\u000d\u000a      methods. Finally, Feuchtwang and Stafford were recruited because of their\u000d\u000a      extensive experience in supervising a large number of doctoral candidates,\u000d\u000a      some of whom they were able to recruit to the CIBF project. Aside from\u000d\u000a      ESRO director Robin Pharoah (PhD on leadership in central China), these\u000d\u000a      included: Zhang Hui (PhD on communal inequality in rural China), Eona Bell\u000d\u000a      (PhD on Chinese migrants in Scotland) and I-chieh Fang (PhD on internal\u000d\u000a      migration in China).\u000d\u000a    The research commissioned from Feuchtwang and Stafford generated\u000d\u000a      significant empirical data about London's Chinese community. For example:\u000d\u000a      the predominant language has shifted from Cantonese to Mandarin; new\u000d\u000a      migrants are often poor and uneducated, unlike the settled Chinese\u000d\u000a      population; living conditions are overcrowded; the migrant use of public\u000d\u000a      services, especially public housing services is negligible; access to the\u000d\u000a      Chinese third sector is also negligible due to linguistic\/cultural\u000d\u000a      divisions; there may be as many undocumented as documented Chinese\u000d\u000a      migrants in London; London's Chinese population is likely to be double the\u000d\u000a      official estimates. Moreover, the research demonstrated significant\u000d\u000a      divisions between the settled Chinese population and the new economic\u000d\u000a      migrants, and revealed the poverty and isolation of many newcomers, in\u000d\u000a      spite of their attempts, in some cases, to sustain communal networks via\u000d\u000a      mechanisms previously explored in research by Feuchtwang and Stafford. It\u000d\u000a      also highlighted cultural misunderstandings and expectations which impede\u000d\u000a      integration, such as migrants' ideas about `getting ahead' which were\u000d\u000a      based on assumptions acquired in China but that proved relatively\u000d\u000a      unhelpful in the UK.\u000d\u000a    KEY RESEARCHERS: Stephan Feuchtwang has been at LSE as a research\u000d\u000a      fellow and professor since 1998.

The research provided them with evidence in support of\u000a      their claim that early\u000a      intervention in problem cases would save money in the longer term (by\u000a      preventing complex knock-on\u000a\u0009  effects, and by forestalling the emergence of `problem clusters'). In\u000a      other words, the research\u000a      supported their claim that in the long run it would cost more to cut funds\u000a      and to force paralegals in\u000a      Law Centres to adopt the new `fixed fee' regime as this would force them\u000a      to waste time on\u000a      calculating their exact fee rather than delivering value for money through\u000a      the benefits of face-to-face advice.\u000a    Two further reports used the paper (among other data) in support of\u000a      similar claims about the `value\u000a      for money' offered by advisers (citing it as James 2010, `At the legal\u000a      interface'):\u000a    \"For every &#163;1 of legal aid expenditure on housing advice, the state\u000a      potentially saves &#163;2.34.\"\u000a    \"For every &#163;1 of legal aid expenditure on debt advice, the state\u000a      potentially saves &#163;2.98.\"\u000a    \"For every &#163;1 of legal aid expenditure on benefits advice, the state\u000a      potentially saves &#163;8.80.\"\u000a    \"For every &#163;1 of legal aid expenditure on employment advice, the state\u000a      potentially saves &#163;7.13.\"\u000a      [Source A].\u000a    This report attempted to give a monetary value to case-worker\/client\u000a      interactions in order to prove\u000a      their indispensability [A].\u000a    A second report, authored by the Council for Social Action set up in 2007\u000a      by then Prime Minister\u000a      Gordon Brown, cited a different draft of the same paper &#8212; James and\u000a      Killick (in preparation), `Afraid\u000a      of the Form' &#8212; in support of its claim that empathy and quality\u000a      interaction are of key importance:\u000a    `the quality of the human relationship between the person delivering\u000a      public services and the person\u000a      using public services is an important factor' [C]. From the case workers'\u000a      point of view, the role of a\u000a      good relationship in gathering `good information' from clients and in\u000a      taking the case forward is key.\u000a      Establishing such a relationship, which requires both time and skill,\u000a      contributes to the clients'\u000a      `empowerment', increasing their confidence and ability to deal with\u000a      problems without the need of\u000a      external help.\u000a    \"One important claim in the second report was that benefits are felt\u000a      `even if the legal outcome is\u000a      not what the client wanted.' [B]. The pilot study cited in the report,\u000a      conducted in Solihull with a\u000a      control in Leeds, measured `faster recognition and integration of\u000a      refugees'. It produced a higher\u000a      grant rate of 58% (Leeds 34%), meaning cases did not proceed through to\u000a      expensive appeal.\u000a      Correspondingly, Allowed Appeal rates in the pilot were 10% (Leeds 20%).\u000a      On the measure\u000a      `effective conclusion of negative decisions', there was improvement in the\u000a      pilot area from 10% to\u000a      16% (Leeds 5% to 6%) and the report notes `a strong impression that\u000a      negative decisions were\u000a      better received by asylum claimants.' [B]. Testimony by Matthew Smerdon,\u000a      of the Baring\u000a      Foundation, reiterates the importance of the research in demonstrating the\u000a      importance of one-to-one\u000a\u0009  relationships [C]. A similar line of argument was echoed by other\u000a      reports, such as the Citizens\u000a      Advice Bureau [D],Trude and Gibbs [E], and NEF [F].\u000a    In sum, the LSE research was used to lobby the then Labour Government's\u000a      Ministry of Justice, so\u000a      as to reduce the negative impact of the proposed new `fixed fee'\u000a      arrangements on the quality of the\u000a      relationship between advisors and their clients. When the Law Centre was\u000a      threatened with closure,\u000a      the Ministry of Justice, under (later) Lord Bach, was prompted by these\u000a      reports to provide\u000a      emergency interim funding: various private law firms, non-profit\u000a      organizations, charitable trusts and\u000a      other funding bodies were likewise influenced to club together to shore up\u000a      the Centre, in\u000a      recognition of the `deep value' of the work done by its advisers and\u000a      paralegals, as noted in the\u000a      testimony by Michael Ashe, then CEO of South West London Law Centre [G].\u000a    Subsequent research:\u000a    2. Policy\u000a    When the Coalition Government came into power, its new Legal Aid,\u000a      Sentencing and Punishment\u000a      of Offenders Bill threatened to cut legal aid funds even further. James\u000a      and Forbess wrote a briefing\u000a      (Section 3, 4) for the House of Lords, ahead of the second reading of the\u000a      Bill on 21st November\u000a      2011, which was reported on in the media [H]. It was read by members of\u000a      the House and informed\u000a      the debate on a proposed amendment to the Bill to keep social welfare\u000a      benefit appeals within the\u000a      scope of legal aid. Although the amendment was turned back by the House of\u000a      Commons, welfare\u000a      benefit appeals on points of law were discussed during the second reading\u000a      (e.g., by Peers Lord\u000a      Philips of Sudbury and Lord Newton of Braintree and by Baroness Doocey,\u000a      who proposed the\u000a      amendment) and were retained within the scope of legal aid funding. The\u000a      retention of at least this\u000a      one area of funding was of key importance, given how frequently low-level\u000a      bureaucrats make\u000a      mistakes in allocating or deciding on benefits cases, and how crucial it\u000a      is (for the individuals\u000a      concerned, and for broader questions of legal precedent and access to\u000a      justice) to challenge such\u000a      misallocations when they occur.\u000a    Forbess in consultation with James also contributed to the debate through\u000a      various interventions on\u000a      social media (e.g. Section 3: 6 and others; see also Source I).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    By exploring the social and economic effects of cuts in funding for legal\u000a      aid, this research directly\u000a      influenced legislation aimed at preserving legal aid for welfare benefit\u000a      appeals. This was a major\u000a      victory for campaigners who cited the research to lobby against cuts\u000a      proposed by the 2011 Legal\u000a      Aid Bill.

It\u000a      examined the effects of the new `fixed fee' system of funding introduced\u000a      by the Labour\u000a      Government. Paralegals, having previously been reimbursed on an `hourly\u000a      paid' scheme that\u000a      recognized the complexities of their cases, were now administering a new\u000a      billing structure focused\u000a      on single `acts of assistance'. The research analysed how the reforms,\u000a      aimed at reducing costs,\u000a      might affect access to justice for the poor and vulnerable.\u000a    The research focused on the advice given to immigrants and asylum seekers\u000a      in branches of the\u000a      South West London Law Centres (SWLLC), and gave an ethnographic account of\u000a      one-on-one\u000a      relationships between caseworkers and clients. Despite pressure for\u000a      efficiency and savings, the\u000a      research found that empathy drove advisers to provide often exceptional\u000a      levels of aid to their\u000a      clients as they faced an arbitrary bureaucracy. Such personalized\u000a      commitment was nonetheless\u000a      aimed at shaping immigrant\/refugees as model citizens by persuading them\u000a      to accept the\u000a      decisions of the bureaucracy.\u000a    The research documented the new system of legal aid remuneration. Instead\u000a      of cases being\u000a      remunerated for the exact amount of time spent on them, as in the past,\u000a      eligibility for legal aid was\u000a      now decided before a case started and work was awarded on a `threshold'\u000a      basis: eligible cases\u000a      that reached the first threshold were paid an initial flat fee of &#163;260 &#8212;\u000a      representing four hours and 26\u000a      minutes of caseworker time; cases deemed to merit extra time (by reference\u000a      to their presumed\u000a      higher chance of success, and after authorization from the Legal Services\u000a      Commission), could\u000a      proceed to the next threshold of &#163;765. As a result, anything in between\u000a      was, in effect, non-\u000a      reimbursable, causing the Law Centre to lose money (James and Killick\u000a      2010). The research\u000a      concluded that the new `fixed fee' regime was making it too expensive to\u000a      pursue complex or\u000a      precedent-setting legal cases.\u000a    Subsequent research [3,4,5,6,] was undertaken in the Southwark Law Centre\u000a      and at Community\u000a      Links, a charity in Canning Town, and explored broader-reaching forms of\u000a      legal aid-funded advice\u000a      to a variety of clients in receipt of welfare benefits. At this time,\u000a      further cuts to legal aid funding\u000a      were being debated, as the Coalition Government claimed that welfare\u000a      benefits do not need\u000a      specialist legal advice. Against this background, the research focused on\u000a      the provision of state\u000a      services at the local level and concluded that advice was in fact\u000a      essential. The second tranche of\u000a      research [3] (and Source I in Section 5, by Will Horwitz of Community\u000a      Links), showed still further\u000a      how early intervention and one-on-one advice interactions are increasingly\u000a      necessary, because of\u000a      1) the uncoordinated manner in which the state provides services, 2) the\u000a      need for professionalism\u000a      as lower level bureaucrats become ever more inexpert, and 3) the growing\u000a      complexity of\u000a      legislation, incomprehensible to ordinary citizens. The need is\u000a      particularly acute in an adversarial\u000a      common law system where success in both negotiation and litigation depends\u000a      on familiarity with\u000a      complex procedural rules, recent legislation and case law. On the one\u000a      hand, advisers and\u000a      governmental service-providers seem to function as part of a single\u000a      system, with the former often\u000a      correcting mistakes made by the latter. On the other hand, advisers can\u000a      challenge government:\u000a      overturning unfair legislation and even contesting the categories and\u000a      assumptions that are\u000a      enshrined in law. These findings refute the Coalition Government's\u000a      insistence that social welfare\u000a      problems ought not to necessitate legal assistance and demonstrate that\u000a      advisers are crucial in\u000a      helping welfare dependent people to actualize their rights.\u000a    KEY RESEARCHERS\u000a    The research was conducted by Deborah James (Professor at LSE\u000a      throughout), Evan Killick\u000a      (research fellow in 2007-8), and Alice Forbess (research fellow in\u000a      2011-12).

Since\u000d\u000a      April 2012, all companies harvesting FSC-certified wood sold worldwide,\u000d\u000a      deriving from the 4 million square kilometres of the Congo Basin, are\u000d\u000a      required to follow the FPIC process.\u000d\u000a    Lewis and Freeman's work on FPIC resulted in a book [a] translated into\u000d\u000a      French, three summary pamphlets in English, Portuguese and French, formal\u000d\u000a      presentations at the United Nations, Swiss Ministry for Economic Affairs,\u000d\u000a      ministerial meetings in France, FSC meetings in the Congo Basin, project\u000d\u000a      reviews and presentations at Chatham House, and training sessions for\u000d\u000a      forestry workers from at least 12 African and non-African countries\u000d\u000a      through the Centre for Social Excellence [1].\u000d\u000a    Reading the book persuaded professional organisations representing the\u000d\u000a      tropical forestry industry in the Congo Basin (Association interafricaine\u000d\u000a      des industries foresti&#232;res IFIA, representing over 300 companies, and\u000d\u000a      L'Association Technique Internationale des Bois Tropicaux ATIBT, 260\u000d\u000a      members) to adopt FPIC as the basis for establishing partnerships between\u000d\u000a      the companies they represent and the people living in their concessions\u000d\u000a      [2]. They signalled this by organising training sessions run by Lewis for\u000d\u000a      40 staff working in the social aspects of forestry from 12 of their member\u000d\u000a      companies through the Centre for Social Excellence, as described below\u000d\u000a      [5], as well as sponsoring talks by Lewis for their members in September\u000d\u000a      2008 and February 2009 [3].\u000d\u000a    Despite pressure to reject FPIC from some quarters, regional guidelines\u000d\u000a      for the application of FSC Principles and Criteria in the Congo Basin\u000d\u000a      adopted FPIC as a central concept mediating relationships on 26 April 2012\u000d\u000a      (FSC-STD-CB-01-2012-EN Congo Basin Regional Standard), as a result of\u000d\u000a      Lewis' research [2]. This document lays out the FSC standard for all\u000d\u000a      forests in the six countries of the region [4]. FSC Criterion 2.2, for\u000d\u000a      example, states: 'Local communities with legal or customary tenure or use\u000d\u000a      rights shall maintain control, to the extent necessary to protect their\u000d\u000a      rights or resources, over forest operations unless they delegate control\u000d\u000a      with free and informed consent to other agencies' (p. 23) and similar\u000d\u000a      language is included in 3.1 (control of forest management by indigenous\u000d\u000a      people, p. 26), and 3.4 (compensation for traditional knowledge, p. 32).\u000d\u000a      By 15 July 2013, 10 FSC certificates covering over 4.4 million ha of\u000d\u000a      forest had been issued [4].\u000d\u000a    Recognising that there was a lack of local capacity to implement forestry\u000d\u000a      based on FPIC with local communities, The Forest Trust sought funds\u000d\u000a      amounting to &#8364;1.2 million to set up a specialist regional training\u000d\u000a        centre for young graduates on how to implement the highest standards in\u000d\u000a        social forestry. Based on his research which had shown the lacunae\u000d\u000a      in forestry skills, Lewis planned and helped establish the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Social Excellence (CSE) in 2008 &#8212; designing the curriculum based on the\u000d\u000a      principles of research, purchasing the library and organising student\u000d\u000a      selection processes &#8212; and has taught there bi-annually since 2008. The CSE\u000d\u000a      provides a one-year theoretical and practical training for graduates from\u000d\u000a      the Congo Basin to learn the social aspects of forestry, including FPIC,\u000d\u000a      involving forest people in mapping and decision-making processes, conflict\u000d\u000a      resolution, advanced communication skills, rural micro project management,\u000d\u000a      etc. [5].\u000d\u000a    The CSE recruits students from Gabon, Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic\u000d\u000a      Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and Cameroon. It also runs\u000d\u000a      short courses for employees of forestry companies. By mid-2013 the CSE had\u000d\u000a      40 current students or alumni [5], of whom all but two were employed in\u000d\u000a      forestry orientated research, industrial and commercial forest sectors or\u000d\u000a      in civil society organisations in the Congo Basin. Two-week short term\u000d\u000a      training for full-time professionals was provided to almost 52 individuals\u000d\u000a      from over 12 forestry companies and 4 NGOs [5].\u000d\u000a    FPIC requires that forest communities are well informed about the issues\u000d\u000a      facing their forest. With a low population density (&lt;1 person\/km2),\u000d\u000a      little infrastructure and small communities effective communication\u000d\u000a      represents a real challenge. To develop an effective strategy to raise\u000d\u000a        community awareness of these issues, Lewis supported TFT with a\u000d\u000a      &#8364;700,000 Chirac Foundation grant in 2005 to set up Radio Biso na Biso, a\u000d\u000a      community radio station for forest people. The radio station has been\u000d\u000a      operational since June 2009 broadcasting exclusively in the 12 local\u000d\u000a      languages spoken in the forest for 4-6 hours a day, with 20,000 known\u000d\u000a      listeners, and an estimated 30,000 more outside the concession [6]. At\u000d\u000a      least eighteen local people were trained in journalism and\u000d\u000a      programme-making in 2008-2013 [9]. As of 2012, it is now fully financed by\u000d\u000a      the forestry company on whose concession it is based, and is a sustainable\u000d\u000a      and independently supported enterprise.\u000d\u000a    This has had many benefits: Previously ignored local forest people now\u000d\u000a      have a say in the management of their local forest areas, their rights to\u000d\u000a      their land and resources are formally recognised, they are able to protect\u000d\u000a      their key resources from damage during industrial activities, and they can\u000d\u000a      report illegal activity or damage to their resources to local and national\u000d\u000a      authorities. One advantage of the system appreciated by local people is\u000d\u000a      that their maps do the talking for them, they can avoid going in person to\u000d\u000a      negotiate in intimidating surroundings and in languages they often do not\u000d\u000a      understand. In 2010, Lewis was awarded the Cuthbert Peek award by the\u000d\u000a      Royal Geographical Society in recognition of the benefits to local\u000d\u000a      communities of this unique approach [7]. Additionally the geo-tags enable\u000d\u000a      local concerns to be easily and efficiently integrated into forest\u000d\u000a      management planning which is organised in Geographic Information Systems\u000d\u000a      (GIS). This simplicity led to the rapid adoption of this methodology (with\u000d\u000a      many modifications) by every logging company seeking an FSC certificate in\u000d\u000a      the Congo Basin. So far FSC has certified companies working in over 4\u000d\u000a      million hectares of high conservation value forest of the Congo Basin [4].\u000d\u000a      This exposure led some hunter-gatherers to request new software builds to\u000d\u000a      document illegal poaching [e]. This has been developed and they are\u000d\u000a      currently in the early stages of deploying the system in 2,800,000\u000d\u000a      hectares of forest in northern Congo [e].\u000d\u000a    The project attracted substantial media coverage which brought to global\u000d\u000a      attention the research and how it helps to fulfil the need for forest\u000d\u000a      peoples to be proactively involved in protecting their environment, for\u000d\u000a      example [8]:\u000d\u000a    - BBC News at Ten: GPS helps Pygmies defend forest. 30 January\u000d\u000a      2008 ( averaging 4.9 million viewers);\u000d\u000a    - New Scientist: `Interactive maps help Pygmies fight back', by\u000d\u000a      Kat Austen.

He has worked in the Congo Basin\u000d\u000a      with forest communities since 1993 and through regular research visits,\u000d\u000a      notably to Congo-Brazzaville, gained unique insight into local culture and\u000d\u000a      society, and the impact of national and global forces on forest peoples'\u000d\u000a      lives and livelihoods. Since the late 1990s there has been an increasing\u000d\u000a      international effort to regularise the application of the concept of FPIC\u000d\u000a      to govern the relations between third parties seeking to exploit or\u000d\u000a      otherwise impact on local peoples' land or resources.\u000d\u000a    Together with Luke Freeman (lecturer in Anthropology at UCL since 2007)\u000d\u000a      and Sophie Boreill (Anthroscape Ltd), between 2006 and 2008 Lewis visited\u000d\u000a      some of the most advanced forestry companies in Democratic Republic of\u000d\u000a      Congo, Republic of Congo and Gabon to identify effective practices they\u000d\u000a      employed to develop partnerships with local people. Based on the\u000d\u000a      observation of cultural differences between Northern conceptions of\u000d\u000a      `consent' (a signature) and local ideas (a process of mutual\u000d\u000a      satisfaction), following Lewis's arrival at UCL, he and his colleagues\u000d\u000a      identified and drafted clear guidelines for implementing an FPIC approach\u000d\u000a      to relations between powerful industrial companies and local people that\u000d\u000a      would be meaningful for both parties [a, b]. This was used to define the\u000d\u000a      steps required to apply FPIC in the context of forestry certification\u000d\u000a      schemes [a]. To do so required the development of new engagement methods,\u000d\u000a      organisational approaches, and specially adapted tools (both hard and\u000d\u000a      software) to enable well-informed and fairer discussions to be possible\u000d\u000a      between these different groups, and so that local forest people can\u000d\u000a      accurately map their lands and resources, and monitor logging activities\u000d\u000a      in their forest areas [c, d].\u000d\u000a    Regularly returning to the forest for research means that Lewis maintains\u000d\u000a      regular contact with local people.

But with the publication of Debt,\u000d\u000a      produced whilst at Goldsmiths, his impact has assumed dimensions with few,\u000d\u000a      if any, precedents in anthropology. It is perhaps unique in the breadth of\u000d\u000a      its international recognition and for the range of current debate over\u000d\u000a      which it is influential. Sources to corroborate the impact are given in\u000d\u000a      parenthesis and detailed in section 5.\u000d\u000a    Graeber's arguments in Debt, and particularly the galvanizing\u000d\u000a      claim that the current economic crises might be usefully informed by\u000d\u000a      reflecting on the long historical record of debt cancellation, received\u000d\u000a      much initial attention because it was considered so radical. As the\u000d\u000a      disarray of standard economic explanation and policy became more widely\u000d\u000a      acknowledged, debt cancellation came to be more seriously considered and\u000d\u000a      discussed in important public forums. In Germany, Debt was number\u000d\u000a      2 in the best-seller lists for a week and drew the attention of both FAZ\u000d\u000a      and Der Spiegel. It was also intensely discussed in Italy, where\u000d\u000a      the book was a number 10 best-seller. These levels of sales and coverage\u000d\u000a      were achieved in Germany and Italy by the English-language edition. First\u000d\u000a      published in English in 2011, Debt is scheduled to appear in translation\u000d\u000a      in: Chinese (both simplified and traditional characters), Italian,\u000d\u000a      Turkish, Greek, Korean, German, Japanese, Dutch, Spanish, Slovak, Swedish,\u000d\u000a      Czech, and French.\u000d\u000a    In The Chronicle of Higher Education (15 April 2013) Keith Hart\u000d\u000a      noted that: `An argument of Debt's scope hasn't been made by a\u000d\u000a      professional anthropologist for the best part of a century, certainly not\u000d\u000a      one with as much contemporary relevance' (3). That relevance was indicated\u000d\u000a      in part by the breadth of mainstream publications that published articles\u000d\u000a      on or interviews with Graeber: Business Week, Harpers, Vanity Fair,\u000d\u000a        Rolling Stone, and the New Yorker, among others. Coverage\u000d\u000a      was not confined to outlets that might be expected to sympathise with the\u000d\u000a      views Graeber espoused, but also included publications such as The\u000d\u000a        Economist and US News and World Report (in which Debt\u000d\u000a      was recommended as one of the `Best Summer Money Books for Adults' (4).\u000d\u000a    While Debt was the focal point for much of this print coverage, Graeber's\u000d\u000a      work on the relationship between activism and anthropology was also\u000d\u000a      prominent, especially at the height of the Occupy movement's\u000d\u000a      activities, for example in a New York Times Book Review piece by\u000d\u000a      Thomas Meaney (`Graeber's most important contribution to the movement may\u000d\u000a      owe less to his activism as an anarchist than to his background as an\u000d\u000a      anthropologist') (5). Graeber has written for newspapers and other print\u000d\u000a      media including The Guardian (6) In These Times and the Commoner,\u000d\u000a      as a commentator whose combined anthropological and activist background\u000d\u000a      lends authority to his pronouncements on money, anarchism, Occupy\u000d\u000a      and the radical imagination (7).\u000d\u000a    Outside the mainstream, Debt has been the focus of a great deal\u000d\u000a      of political and technical discussion in well-established Left\u000d\u000a      publications (e.g. New Left Review) and new publications and blogs\u000d\u000a      reflecting a post-New Left, web-enabled bridging of academic and political\u000d\u000a      commentary (e.g. Jacobin, Crooked Timber (8). Among academic\u000d\u000a      economists, especially those open to heterodoxy, and economics pundits, Debt\u000d\u000a      has opened up discussion drawing heavily on political economic, classical\u000d\u000a      and neo-classical debates, and has reintroduced economic anthropology as a\u000d\u000a      source of concepts of contemporary relevance. In the domain of new and\u000d\u000a      online media, the impact of Debt has continued to expand long\u000d\u000a      beyond the typical life of a `best-seller' published in 2011. There are\u000d\u000a      13,800 YouTube entries for interviews with Graeber (these include\u000d\u000a      many network broadcasts as well as interviews for more specialist\u000d\u000a      audiences) the most popular of which has been viewed almost 40,000 times\u000d\u000a      (9) and on REDDIT there are 520 entries ranging across Anthropology, the\u000d\u000a      History of Ideas and Anarchism. Debt won the inaugural Bread and\u000d\u000a      Roses Award for radical literature in the UK in 2011.\u000d\u000a    The impact of Debt has a breadth and depth unique among modern\u000d\u000a      anthropological publications, in part because it addresses matters of\u000d\u000a      great public interest which are typically mediated by an academic\u000d\u000a      specialism, economics, which is broadly seen to be `relevant' in a way\u000d\u000a      denied to many other academic fields. The impact of Graeber's work on\u000d\u000a      direct action and anarchism is enhanced by its association with his\u000d\u000a      commentary on the current economic crisis. It reflects interest in a\u000d\u000a      discourse based in a `social movement' politics that has arisen in the\u000d\u000a      core Euro-American economies, most visibly revealed in Occupy. Said to be\u000d\u000a      the coiner of the expression `we are the 99%' (10), Graeber is an activist\u000d\u000a      and author whose work has become a key reference point for a largely\u000d\u000a      generational politics of the franchised-become-disenfranchised (11).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    David Graeber's research has four main interrelated strands. The first\u000d\u000a      concerns the relationship between economic anthropology and\u000d\u000a      anthropological theory; the second concerns a theory of value developed\u000d\u000a      through comparative analysis in anthropology; the third concerns the\u000d\u000a      concept of debt revealed in the historical and ethnographic record; and\u000d\u000a      the fourth concerns the relationship between social theory, and direct\u000d\u000a      action and participatory democracy. These strands have had immense impact,\u000d\u000a      via two works in particular, Direct Action: An Ethnography (2009)\u000d\u000a      and Debt: the First 5,000 Years (2011). Debt, in\u000d\u000a      particular, has been acclaimed as one of the most insightful contributions\u000d\u000a      to economic thought to have emerged from the post-2008 reflections on the\u000d\u000a      banking and financial crisis. It is an agenda-setting contribution to\u000d\u000a      discussions across the board and around the world, a singular achievement\u000d\u000a      for an anthropological work. Such a wide public profile for an\u000d\u000a      anthropological text merits comparison with the impacts of Mead, Lewis and\u000d\u000a      Levi-Strauss.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Goldsmiths, University of London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Goldsmiths' College","InstitutionName":"Goldsmiths' College","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"London","UKPRN":10002718}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Work undertaken and published whilst at Goldsmiths:\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

Some of the research detailed here was\u000d\u000a      undertaken whilst employed at Yale prior to 2007 but the most important\u000d\u000a      was written and published whilst he was at Goldsmiths.\u000d\u000a    The research that forms the basis for Graeber's subsequent work lay in\u000d\u000a      the ethnographic fieldwork in Madagascar that provided the material for\u000d\u000a      his PhD dissertation. There, working among Malagasy peoples whose notions\u000d\u000a      of politics evade encapsulation as `institutions', Graeber confronted a\u000d\u000a      well-known phenomenon in anthropological investigation, the `society\u000d\u000a      against the state.' This concept was framed by Clastres, and like\u000d\u000a      Clastres, Graeber resisted the conventional mode of analysis according to\u000d\u000a      which the absence of explicit political structures was viewed as an\u000d\u000a      obstacle to be overcome. Instead, such an absence was conceived as a\u000d\u000a      virtuous departure from `top-down' political control, not the noble\u000d\u000a      savagery of Rousseau, but a rejection of the potential dystopia of\u000d\u000a      political hierarchy. That initial research provided the grounding for\u000d\u000a      later work that culminated in two broad positions that lie at the heart of\u000d\u000a      the published work under consideration here. These are the relevance of\u000d\u000a      anthropology (implying cross-cultural comparison and method based in\u000d\u000a      fieldwork) to a theory of politics and to a theory of the economy. They\u000d\u000a      are recognizable to audiences with specialist academic interests, but also\u000d\u000a      to those with extra-academic interests in public culture. The development\u000d\u000a      of Graeber's research is simultaneously conventional (the typical\u000d\u000a      development of a PhD project into an expansive mid-career synthesis) and\u000d\u000a      also extraordinary, in terms of impact. It has produced a body of work\u000d\u000a      whose academic authority translates into vastly wider readerships than\u000d\u000a      most academics could hope to achieve. Debt [1]\u000d\u000a      galvanized an academic audience looking for persuasive accounts of the\u000d\u000a      underlying causes of the financial crisis, but was equally visible in the\u000d\u000a      hands of travellers on the London transportation system and in beach bags.\u000d\u000a    Direct Action[2] takes conventional externally\u000d\u000a      oriented fieldwork and applies it to an internal (US) social movement. By\u000d\u000a      employing field-based direct engagement with research subjects, Direct\u000d\u000a        Action foregoes the posture of outside participant-observer and\u000d\u000a      adopts the point of view of a partisan observer-participant. Similarly, Debt\u000d\u000a      departs from convention by eschewing the direct gathering of primary\u000d\u000a      material in favour of extensive mining of secondary historical and\u000d\u000a      ethnographic sources. Both works exhibit a generational anthropological\u000d\u000a      ambition to cohere around core disciplinary concerns, while simultaneously\u000d\u000a      stretching the remit of anthropological theory to address matters of\u000d\u000a      general public concern.

Suzanne Kirkpatrick, a New York based\u000a      designer and creative technologist, cites Visibly Muslim as a key\u000a      influence on her 2011 project, `retroflective' burkas which focused on\u000a      improving the Afghan burkha by using breathable light-sensitive and\u000a      affordable fabrics.(12a)\u000a    Textile artist, Denise Maroney, also cites Tarlo's book as a key\u000a      inspiration for her art installation, Burkha, at the Textile Arts\u000a      Centre in Brooklyn, New York (2011) where she explored ideas of public and\u000a      private and the potential aesthetic appeal of covering.(12b,c)\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Emma Tarlo's research on modest dress and Islamic fashion plays a\u000a      substantial role in combatting social prejudice and promoting\u000a      understanding of religious minority groups in Britain and Europe.\u000a      Addressing issues of the rights to religious expression and the need for\u000a      socially inclusive design, it has attracted widespread coverage in British\u000a      and international media, including religious and ethnic minority and\u000a      fashion media, stimulating public debate on-line and off.

Tarlo went on to co-edit (with Annelies Moors) a collective\u000a      volume, Islamic Fashion and Anti-Fashion: New Perspectives from Europe\u000a        and America (2013) which documents how Muslims throughout Europe are\u000a      participating in public debates about identity, integration and the role\u000a      of religion in the public sphere through their clothing choices.(2)\u000a      This research was conducted as part of the of the ESRC\/Norface Research\u000a      Programme, `The Re-Emergence of Religion as a Social Force in Europe.'\u000a    In addition Tarlo collaborated as co-investigator with Reina Lewis in an\u000a      AHRC-funded project, Mediating Modesty (2010 - 2011), which\u000a      investigated the inter-faith exchanges taking place between Muslims, Jews\u000a      and Christians through a shared interest in modest fashion. The resulting\u000a      book, Modest Fashion: Styling Bodies, Mediating Faith (2013,\u000a      edited by Reina Lewis) contains an article by Tarlo on Jewish-Muslim\u000a      online exchanges relating to dress.(3) Through\u000a      participation in conferences and workshops linked to these programmes and\u000a      through taking up invitations to speak at the Universities of London,\u000a      Oxford, Cambridge, Cardiff, California, Princeton, Indiana, CUNY, Atlanta,\u000a      Delhi, Stockholm, Paris, Potsdam, Leiden and Amsterdam, Tarlo has engaged\u000a      in dialogue with scholars from anthropology, religious studies, sociology,\u000a      fashion and museum studies and her work is informed by this international\u000a      inter-disciplinary engagement.\u000a    Key findings of the research are as follows:\u000a    \u000a      Far from indicating a `clash of civilizations' between Islam and the\u000a        West, visibly Muslim dress practices in Britain and Europe are strongly\u000a        influenced by secular fashions and ideologies.\u000a      Although associated in many mainstream media and political debates\u000a        with backwardness, foreignness, social segregation and religious\u000a        extremism, fashionable new forms of modest dress are attractive to many\u000a        young women of faith (both Muslim and Jewish) as a means of expressing\u000a        identity and belonging. This development does not so much show their\u000a        distance from mainstream youth culture as their engagement with it.\u000a      A new generation of Muslim designers and entrepreneurs have emerged\u000a        who perceive Islamic fashion as a powerful medium of communication\u000a        through which they seek to promote a more inclusive multi-cultural\u000a        society.\u000a      Her research highlights the role design can play in encouraging\u000a        communication and social integration, combatting prejudice and widening\u000a        the participation of women from diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds\u000a        in activities such as sports.\u000a      The modest fashion sector cuts across religious differences to some\u000a        extent, and plays a role in bringing women of different faiths into\u000a        dialogue.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42778","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Jacob Zuma's election in 2007 signalled a new openness towards economic\u000d\u000a      policies.

His extensive work covers the broad\u000d\u000a      traditions of\u000d\u000a      heterodox economics, with particular contributions to the history of\u000d\u000a      economic thought,\u000d\u000a      development, economics imperialism, consumption and social capital, in\u000d\u000a      each of which he is an\u000d\u000a      internationally acknowledged scholar. What follows, however, focuses on\u000d\u000a      research from 1997 on\u000d\u000a      the specific conditions of the South African economy, for which he first\u000d\u000a      coined the term Minerals-Energy\u000d\u000a      Complex (MEC) in 1988.\u000d\u000a    Then, Fine was already part of a small team invited to join the\u000d\u000a      Department of Economic Policy of\u000d\u000a      the African National Congress (ANC) to formulate economic policy for the\u000d\u000a      anticipated post-Apartheid\u000d\u000a      period. This led him to posit the existence of the MEC. Fine's research\u000d\u000a      collaborator in\u000d\u000a      the early 1990s on the ESRC-funded project to develop the notion of the\u000d\u000a      MEC, Zavareh\u000d\u000a      Rustomjee, was subsequently appointed Director-General of South Africa's\u000d\u000a      Department of Trade\u000d\u000a      and Industry in 1994. In the years that followed, he and Fine co-authored\u000d\u000a      what is now recognised\u000d\u000a      as a seminal contribution to South African economics, South Africa's\u000d\u000a        Political Economy: From\u000d\u000a        Minerals-Energy Complex to Industrialisation (1997). Although not\u000d\u000a      immediately influential across\u000d\u000a      South Africa, with a change in government in 2007 the MEC has increasingly\u000d\u000a      entered into policy\u000d\u000a      dialogue and formulation, gaining resonance in wider culture.\u000d\u000a    What distinguished this approach was the resolute focus on South Africa's\u000d\u000a      distinctive economic\u000d\u000a      realities, shaped by historical, geographical and political circumstance,\u000d\u000a      power relations perpetuated\u000d\u000a      and enforced by Apartheid and the abundance of certain natural resources.\u000d\u000a      How these factors\u000d\u000a      blended to produce certain types of partnerships between state and private\u000d\u000a      capital and the\u000d\u000a      disproportionate emphasis on the development of a select number of\u000d\u000a      activities around mining and\u000d\u000a      energy were key themes of the book. This contrasted with the then\u000d\u000a      widespread advocacy of South\u000d\u000a      Africa as having failed in import-substituting industrialisation,\u000d\u000a      especially for consumer goods.\u000d\u000a    Fine's research on the MEC emphasised the key role played by its core and\u000d\u000a      related sectors such\u000d\u000a      as mining, steel and electricity and the shifting influence of economic\u000d\u000a      and political interests, as well\u000d\u000a      as corresponding impacts on development path. Both historically and\u000d\u000a      currently, Fine's research\u000d\u000a      investigates instances and patterns of continuity and change associated\u000d\u000a      with the MEC. For\u000d\u000a      example, he examines the growth of large-scale Afrikaner capital during\u000d\u000a      Apartheid and its\u000d\u000a      dominance over small-scale counterparts, and ultimate incorporation with\u000d\u000a      large-scale mining\u000d\u000a      capital.\u000d\u000a    For the post-Apartheid period, Fine emphasizes the globalisation and\u000d\u000a      financialisation of\u000d\u000a      conglomerate capital, and the incorporation of a new black elite through\u000d\u000a      these and other processes\u000d\u000a      whilst core MEC sectors remain crucial to the economy. The role of\u000d\u000a      (illegal) capital flight, as much\u000d\u000a      as 20% of GDP, has been highlighted, as has its impact on the levels and\u000d\u000a      efficacy of domestic\u000d\u000a      investment and correspondingly severe constraints on macroeconomic\u000d\u000a      performance and policy.\u000d\u000a      Critiques of the recent government, New Growth Path and National\u000d\u000a      Development Plan have been\u000d\u000a      influential, in observing the failure to address the continuing role of\u000d\u000a      the MEC.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42780","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The exhibition in its four locations, its catalogue, extensive website\u000a      (including video) and education programme shared the aspiration not just\u000a      to show the staggering creativity and variety of the arts of central\u000a      Nigeria, but also the complexity of the region's history and the\u000a      interdisciplinary methods employed to understand the meanings, uses and\u000a      histories of the art objects. The challenge was to synthesise these,\u000a      turning knowledge of the objects and their complex itineraries into an\u000a      approachable show of around 200 items, touching on space, style, history\u000a      and agency. This was achieved by interweaving a journey, from west to east\u000a      along the Benue River Valley, with object types and styles, such as\u000a      maternal figures, masquerades and healing pots displayed as series.\u000a    Approximately 1,000 people attended the opening weekend at UCLA's Fowler\u000a      Museum in mid-February 2011; 21,500 more visited before the exhibition's\u000a      close in July (1, 3, below). The extensive education programme associated\u000a      with the exhibition involved more than 5,500 primary and secondary school\u000a      students (2). Together with museum curators, Fardon helped to produce\u000a      simplified, concise versions of the catalogue texts and trained teachers\u000a      in the use of educational resources, which remain available online and\u000a      correlate with both national and California State standards for teaching\u000a      across multiple subject areas. Three flexible units focus specifically on\u000a      the arts of the Middle Benue: `Ritual Intermediaries in Human Form',\u000a      `Middle Benue Ironworks', and `Masquerades of the Middle Benue'. All draw\u000a      heavily on Fardon's original research and benefit from his direct\u000a      editorial and other contributions.\u000a    The exhibition then travelled to the National Museum of African Art at\u000a      the Smithsonian Institution in Washington (4). Between September 2011 and\u000a      February 2012 there were 156,853 visitors to the museum when Central\u000a        Nigeria Unmasked was the major temporary exhibition. This\u000a      represented a 17% increase in attendance figures over the previous year.\u000a      The exhibition received much press attention throughout its US tour (13),\u000a      but national press coverage was particularly notable during its time in\u000a      Washington: Afrostyle Magazine, with an African-American\u000a      readership online, positively reviewed and recommended the Washington\u000a      exhibition to its readers (5, 14). CNN carried extended coverage on its\u000a      television and online platforms (6).\u000a    The exhibition returned to the West Coast, to the Iris and Gerald B.\u000a      Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University south of San Francisco from May\u000a      to September 2012 (7). The online UCLA educational programme was linked to\u000a      the Cantor website for use by school visitors. 71,941 visitors attended\u000a      the exhibition following positive reviews in the San Francisco\u000a        Chronicle and elsewhere. In a long-running and influential blog\u000a      written primarily for African art collectors and dealers, John Buxton\u000a      recommended the Stanford leg of the tour, `I initially saw this\u000a        exhibition in Los Angeles [...]. It is a superb and important show. If\u000a        you are in the San Francisco area, you need to see this.' (8)\u000a    Further evidence of impact on this constituency is provided by Barry\u000a      Hecht, a leading American collector of Nigerian Art, who has confirmed\u000a      that the exhibition and catalogue increased interest in the art of the\u000a      region, resulting in a number of private gallery shows in Paris in\u000a      particular, and a more informed market for central Nigerian art objects\u000a      with rising prices and museum acquisitions, particularly for Mumuye\u000a      figures, of which Fardon had written a comprehensive reassessment (9).\u000a    The Mus&#233;e du quai Branly (MQB), the preeminent non-Western art museum in\u000a      Paris, was the final destination of the show from November 2012 to January\u000a      2013 (10). 1,800 people attended the opening and there were approximately\u000a      275,000 visitors to the MQB over the period (gallery entry figures are not\u000a      kept). The extent of publicity and press interest in Paris was striking.\u000a      The annual, dealers' non-western art festival, Parcours des mondes,\u000a      in September 2012, was largely Benue-themed. There were 2,000 posters\u000a      around Paris and Le Guide du Visiteur, a special Paris Match\u000a      supplement, was distributed with the magazine and at MQB. The exhibition\u000a      was favourably and extensively reviewed in 15 daily newspapers including Le\u000a        Figaro and Le Monde, 22 weeklies and fortnightlies and 27\u000a      periodical publications (12, 13). Jeune Afrique introduced the\u000a      exhibition as a quiet revolution (`Il est des r&#233;volutions qui ne disent\u000a        pas leur nom\") and concluded that the exhibition was important on\u000a      several grounds: for its interpretation, for overthrowing inherited\u000a      colonial conceptions in favour of African realities, and for revealing,\u000a      often for the first time, pieces of great rarity. Radio (France\u000a        Culture, Radio France International) and television coverage (TV2,\u000a        TV5) was also significant. Based on the success of this exhibition,\u000a      the Fowler Museum and Mus&#233;e du quai Branly signed a collaborative\u000a      programme for UCLA shows to tour to Paris (L'Art des Lega opened in\u000a      late 2013).\u000a    Fardon delivered public lectures, participated in tours and trained\u000a      museum guides at the first and last stages of the tour and with Berns\u000a      presented the catalogue at FILAF in Perpignan (where it won its category\u000a      of art books published in 2011). One distinguished audience member in LA\u000a      was Enid Schildkrout, Chief Curator at the Museum of African Art in New\u000a      York, who travelled to attend the opening and generously praised the\u000a      exhibition and Fardon's contributions (11):\u000a    `I would like to say that your participation as a senior researcher\u000a        and curator for the major international exhibition organized by the\u000a        Fowler Museum at UCLA made a significant contribution to scholarship and\u000a        to the general public's understanding of African art and culture.

By contrast, and despite\u000a      their importance to European modernism, the arts of central Nigeria are\u000a      little known, and there has never been a substantial exhibition of the\u000a      whole of them. The reasons for this are several: central Nigeria is a\u000a      patchwork of ethnic groups difficult to explain succinctly; the objects\u000a      themselves are scattered between numerous international museum and private\u000a      collections; documenting objects is particularly challenging as many of\u000a      them lack attribution and known provenance; broader historical\u000a      reconstruction is thwarted by the absence of archaeological research, the\u000a      disruptions of Atlantic and Saharan slave trades, the religious wars of\u000a      the 19th century, and the exodus of artefacts during the Nigerian civil\u000a      war.\u000a    In this context, art objects offer one of the few resources to\u000a      reconstruct the history of this neglected region, but doing so demands\u000a      extensive and painstaking scholarly work. Central Nigeria Unmasked,\u000a      as catalogue, exhibition and website transforms our understanding of the\u000a      Benue River Valley and fills in the missing zone between southern and\u000a      northern Nigerian historic arts.\u000a    Following ethnographic researches in Nigeria and Cameroon, Fardon was\u000a      invited by Professor Arnold Rubin of UCLA to join `The Arts of the Benue\u000a      Valley' project in 1987. Rubin was a pioneer in the study of the\u000a      extraordinary range of Benue Valley art and wanted to create an exhibition\u000a      portraying the region as a whole, understanding art in order to elucidate\u000a      history.\u000a    Attempts were made following Rubin's death in 1988 to continue the\u000a      project, and Fardon pursued relevant researches episodically through the\u000a      1990s. But it was not until 2005, with the firm pledge of collaboration\u000a      from the Mus&#233;e du quai Branly in Paris that the work of creating the\u000a      exhibition resumed in earnest. With Professor Sidney Kasfir of Emory\u000a      University, and under the direction of Dr Marla Berns, Director of UCLA's\u000a      Fowler Museum, curatorial and editorial responsibilities for the Benue\u000a      River Valley were divided into three: Kasfir was responsible for the Lower\u000a      Benue, Berns for the Upper Benue, and Fardon for the Middle Benue, the\u000a      most extensive of the three.\u000a    The Middle Benue synthesis drew upon Fardon's fieldwork, archival and\u000a      museum research, interviews with dealers and collectors, chapters from\u000a      other fieldworkers, and close reanalysis of Rubin's original research.\u000a      Most of this research was presented first in Central Nigeria Unmasked\u000a      (2011); however, Fardon's initial accounts of Chamba figures and of\u000a      masquerade traditions analysed comparatively were published in earlier\u000a      versions revised, extended and corrected for the catalogue (outputs a and\u000a      b). Two further publications represent the wider diffusion of the\u000a      research: an exhibition preview in African Arts (output d), and a\u000a      French translation of selected introductory materials (output e).\u000a    The main achievements of the research and exhibition can be summarized\u000a      as: delineation of overlapping style regions, presenting objects within\u000a      series of transformations; demonstration of the mobility of objects and\u000a      styles, rebutting ahistorical perceptions of `tribe'; illustration of\u000a      innovation linked to individual artists which is unusual in shows on\u000a      `traditional' African arts; a frank reconstruction of the controversial\u000a      circumstances under which colonial and post-colonial collections of Benue\u000a      arts were assembled outside Nigeria.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42793","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2453866","Name":"Mali"},{"GeoNamesId":"69543","Name":"Yemen"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Through his cross-cultural analysis of the fundamentals of skills\u000a      transfer in craftsmanship, Marchand has come to engage directly with the\u000a      crafts community, greatly informing its understanding, and that of the\u000a      wider public, of the nature of apprenticeship and the importance of\u000a      learning and preserving manual skills. Marchand's efforts to promote\u000a      skills transfer are rendered more significant by the UK government's\u000a      recent decision to remove `crafts' from its list of creative industries,\u000a      thereby devaluing their contribution not only to the UK economy, but to\u000a      its social and cultural life. Multiple closures of notable craft courses\u000a      at higher education institutions have occurred in the UK in the past\u000a      twenty years, while the number of children studying art and other creative\u000a      subjects at GCSE has decreased sharply since 2010. In this context, voices\u000a      such as Marchand's are of increasing importance.\u000a    Based on his research into mud masons in Mali, Marchand curated an\u000a      important exhibition in May 2010 entitled Djenn&#233;: African City of Mud,\u000a      held at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in London. The\u000a      exhibition was created in collaboration with RIBA and was sponsored by\u000a      SOAS, the ESRC, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), and the Dutch\u000a      embassy. It explored the relationship between design and construction\u000a      practices, architectural heritage and cultural identity and, as part of\u000a      the wider `The Art of Mud Building: Heritage and Sustainability' project,\u000a      was accompanied by a series of public lectures and events at RIBA, SOAS\u000a      and the Ismaili Centre (1, below). Approximately 4,000 people attended the\u000a      exhibition, while around 300 attended Marchand's public lecture (2). The\u000a      exhibition was favourably received in The Architectural Review,\u000a      which noted its emphasis on the craftsmanship involved in its maintenance:\u000a      `The real discovery of the exhibition lies not with the architecture, but\u000a      in the story of the community which maintains the site.' (3)\u000a    Marchand has been particularly proactive in his engagement with the FE\u000a      sector, demonstrating the importance of skills transfer to young people\u000a      undertaking craft-related courses. In 2013, Marchand returned to the\u000a      Building Crafts College, London (where he conducted fieldwork as part of\u000a      his ESRC fellowship), to deliver a lecture on his research into the\u000a      development of hand skills and how they relate to the brain.\u000a    He has contributed to the Making Futures project, hosted by Plymouth\u000a      College of Art (an FE institution), which aims at improving understanding\u000a      of how the contemporary crafts are practiced in relation to global\u000a      environmental and sustainability issues (4, 5). At its biennial conference\u000a      in 2011 attended by practitioners, curators, historians, theorists,\u000a      campaigners, activists, and representatives of public and private\u000a      agencies, he presented a lecture discussing what he had learnt from\u000a      working with minaret builders in Yemen, mud masons in Mali and furniture\u000a      maker trainees in East London.\u000a    The organiser of Making Futures, Malcolm Ferris, has characterised the\u000a      contributions to the crafts community of Marchand's research and\u000a      participation in the project as follows (6):\u000a    \"Trevor is developing an important set of perspectives on, and\u000a        understandings of, craft that are helping the community to critically\u000a        appraise and situate the value of practice within a broader set of\u000a        epistemological and cultural-developmental concerns. He has made an\u000a        important contribution to emergent debates around `craft' that are\u000a        concerned with shifting the critical focus away from the object and onto\u000a        the lived experiences of the practitioner and the contexts of practice.\u000a        This has enabled the community to meet on shared ground with other\u000a        disciplines and given them a means (other than practice) by which to\u000a        communicate the value of craft to constituencies beyond the practitioner\u000a        community. These developments are pivotal in terms of the current\u000a        re-evaluation and understanding of craft thinking and making going on in\u000a        society. In this respect his work not only addresses practitioners, but\u000a        also audiences and agencies beyond the immediate crafts community,\u000a        including those that view creative making as a vital component in the\u000a        effort to connect communities.\"\u000a    His impact on one prominent attendee of Making Futures, Rosy Greenlees,\u000a      Executive Director of the UK Crafts Council, was described as follows (7):\u000a    \"I have never heard an academic talk so persuasively about the value\u000a        of making things. His talk validated how the craft community works, and\u000a        the arguments we put to the government regarding the value of\u000a        apprenticeships and the transfer of skills\".\u000a    Further, Greenlees confirms that Marchand's work has helped her to\u000a      provide a robust evidence base supporting representations to government,\u000a      without which she believes ministers would not take her and her\u000a      organisation's arguments seriously.\u000a    In 2013, Marchand convened a two-day workshop in collaboration with the\u000a      Plymouth College of Art on `craftwork as problem solving', related to his\u000a      research on the brain, hands, and tool use. This brought together\u000a      designer-makers, architects, and researchers of crafts to present short\u000a      papers and engage in an exchange of ideas and perspectives.\u000a    In 2012, Marchand was one of three keynote speakers at the Museum of\u000a      Skills Conference hosted by the British Council London, and the result of\u000a      a collaboration between Norske Kunsth&#229;ndverkere The Norwegian Association\u000a      for Arts and Crafts), Artquest and ArtProjects and Solutions (8).( Funded\u000a      by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Royal Norwegian Embassy and\u000a      the Norwegian Association for Arts and Crafts, the conference brought\u000a      together thinkers and practitioners to discuss what skills the arts sector\u000a      will need in the future and how they can be used.\u000a    Marchand's talk was well received and has since been posted on the\u000a      internet by numerous organisations and individuals, thereby increasing its\u000a      impact. Specifically, it was posted on the blog of Robin Wood, a tableware\u000a      craftsman who has produced work for the Tower of London and the film\u000a      director Ridley Scott (9). In his comments on the lecture, Wood stated:\u000a    \"Lots of folk understand handwork and there are a few academics who\u000a        study it and write about it but I think Trevor is perhaps unique in his\u000a        depth of understanding of both worlds. This is great as it stretches my\u000a        thoughts about what I do in the workshop and it also gives those of us\u000a        who work with our hands more credibility. The level of intelligence that\u000a        is required to be really good is not often understood from the outside.\"\u000a    In January 2011, Curator for Africa at the Smithsonian Institution's\u000a      National Museum for Natural History in Washington D.C. invited Marchand to\u000a      co-curate an exhibition grounded in his ongoing research in Djenn&#233;.\u000a      Marchand produced and directed four new short documentary films to be\u000a      exhibited alongside his photographs, which together document the\u000a      livelihoods, expertise, and the masons' struggles to sustain their\u000a      traditional craft in a rapidly-changing world. The year-long exhibition, Mud\u000a        Masons of Mali, opened in the Smithsonian African Voices focus\u000a      gallery on 30 August 2013 and will run for one year (10).

He undertook a PhD at SOAS, conducting fieldwork with\u000a      minaret builders in Yemen (1996-7). Then, as a SOAS Lecturer, he worked\u000a      with mud masons in Mali (2001-present), developing an apprenticing method\u000a      of inquiry that involved labouring alongside builders over long periods to\u000a      gain first-hand knowledge of their technical procedures, educational\u000a      processes, formation of professional identities, and struggles for rank,\u000a      status and work. Immersion as a building-team member enabled him to `learn\u000a      about learning' in working environments characterised by hierarchy,\u000a      competition and, importantly, limited verbal explanation. Results of those\u000a      studies include the monographs Minaret Building &amp; Apprenticeship\u000a        in Yemen (2001) and The Masons of Djenn&#233; (2009); a co-edited\u000a      special issue of the AIA journal Africa on `Knowledge in Practice'\u000a      (2009); the documentary films The Future of Mud (2007) and Masons\u000a        of Djenn&#233; (2013); and public exhibitions on Mali's mud masons at the\u000a      Royal Institute of British Architects (2010) and the Smithsonian\u000a      Institution's Museum for Natural History (2013-14).\u000a    Importantly, first-hand engagement in craftwork has enabled Marchand to\u000a      remain actively involved with his communities of study and share findings,\u000a      to cooperate with craftspeople in the making of films, exhibitions and\u000a      publications, and to delve evermore deeply into his subject of research.\u000a      In 2005, funded by an ESRC Fellowship, Marchand's next project focussed on\u000a      a European case in order to broaden the scope of his comparative studies\u000a      of craft training, and to advance understanding of situated learning,\u000a      embodied communication, and skilled practice. Fieldwork included two years\u000a      of fulltime training in the fine woodwork programme at London's Building\u000a      Crafts College. It produced a fine-grained study of woodworking practices,\u000a      craft identities, and the social politics surrounding vocational training\u000a      and manual work in contemporary Britain. Equally, Marchand's study\u000a      contributes significantly to a theory of human knowledge that begins from\u000a      the premise that `knowing' is an emergent state of mind-body engaged with\u000a      and in the environment, shedding light on the role of motor\u000a      cognition in learning, planning, rehearsing and executing skilled\u000a      practices. The project yielded outputs including a ten-week public lecture\u000a      series on the Transmission of Knowledge, a special issue of the Journal\u000a        of the Royal Anthropological Institute, `Making Knowledge' (2010),\u000a      and the establishment of a cross-disciplinary network with academic\u000a      researchers and with educators and practitioners in the fields of craft,\u000a      architecture and conservation.\u000a    Marchand's current research with UK woodworkers is focussed on the\u000a      complex and evolving relation between brain, hand, and tool as trainees\u000a      learn their craft and develop `personal style'. By employing a combination\u000a      of participant observation, interviews, digital video, and biomechanical\u000a      analysis software, Marchand's latest research is producing a unique\u000a      database for carefully examining grasps, postures and movement with\u000a      handtools, and for analysing practical problem- solving strategies using\u000a      resources-to-hand. Ultimately, the study aims to expand popular concepts\u000a      of `knowledge' to include the intelligent hand at work.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42794","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"51537","Name":"Somalia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In May 2013, Barclays bank announced its decision to close the accounts\u000a      of UK MSBs operating in Somali territories, following an international\u000a      crackdown by regulators on banks whose intermediaries might link them to\u000a      the funding of terrorism (1, below). As the only remaining large UK bank\u000a      to hold such accounts, Barclays' actions threaten to sever the financial\u000a      lifeline for millions of Somalis who rely on remittances to meet their\u000a      basic needs, and will severely hinder re-building of the region.\u000a    Hammond's report and earlier SOAS research have made a significant\u000a      contribution to efforts made by charities, NGOs and Somali diaspora\u000a      communities to raise awareness of the pivotal role of remittances in the\u000a      Somali territories, and the potential humanitarian disaster that could\u000a      result from Barclays' decision. Scott Paul, Oxfam America's Senior\u000a      Humanitarian Policy Advisor focusing on East Africa, confirms Hammond's\u000a      contribution, stating that her FSNAU report greatly informed Oxfam's\u000a      global campaign to persuade banks and policymakers to develop new\u000a      regulations for MSBs that would keep the remittance channel open (2):\u000a    \"Her FSNAU report answered many questions that we were previously\u000a        unable to answer, adding depth to the information we had. We have used\u000a        the statistics from it in our top-line messaging, which has helped us to\u000a        publicise how remittances are used to meet very basic needs, often in\u000a        rural areas. Her research thus broke new ground and de-bunked the myth\u000a        that remittances tend to go to wealthy urban dwellers who could\u000a        otherwise survive without them. Before the FSNAU report, we could not\u000a        say with confidence that the threat to remittances was a humanitarian\u000a        issue. It gave us the confidence to put out campaign messages against\u000a        the closure of the accounts of MSBs\".\u000a    The report's findings have also been cited widely by journalists covering\u000a      the story, particularly Mary Harper, Africa Editor at the BBC World\u000a      Service with a special interest in Somalia, who has relied extensively on\u000a      Hammond's research in her own writing and broadcasting on the subject (3,\u000a      4):\u000a    \"The FSNAU report was particularly valuable to me. The statistics were\u000a        very, very useful when trying to break and back up a story on the\u000a        closure of remittance services. Hammond's data adds immense weight to my\u000a        journalism and makes what I have to say more credible\".\u000a    Hammond herself has been directly involved in an international campaign\u000a      to protect remittance flows to the Somali territories, together with\u000a      Somali community members, the Somali Money Services Association,\u000a      journalists and other academics. A key aspect of the campaign was\u000a      Hammond's letter to the FCO urging it to request that Barclays extend the\u000a      deadline for closing accounts, to help Somali MSBs find alternative\u000a      banking partners, and to convene discussions to develop enhanced due\u000a      diligence mechanisms for MSBs. Over a hundred international academics,\u000a      researchers and aid practitioners signed the letter in just 48 hours, and\u000a      an online e-petition was signed by over 100,000 people. Linked to the\u000a      campaign, Hammond was cited in and interviewed by BBC World (TV), BBC\u000a      Business Report (Radio), BBC London TV, Al Jazeera (TV), The Economist\u000a      (6), the Guardian (7), and the Wall Street Journal (8),\u000a      among numerous others (9). Barclays' Chief Executive responded to\u000a      Hammond's letter, outlining the reasons for the closure, and the bank\u000a      later extended its deadline by one month on two occasions, a decision\u000a      partly motivated by pressure from the campaign. In November 2013,\u000a      Dahabshiil successfully obtained an injunction preventing Barclays from\u000a      terminating its account, pending a full trial in 2014. Moreover, in\u000a      October 2013, it was announced that DFID will be progressing a pilot\u000a      project to secure remittance channels to Somalia, while the UK government\u000a      will form an Action Group on Cross- Border Remittances.\u000a    Abdirashid Duale, CEO of Dahabshiil, the largest MSB operating in the\u000a      Somali territories, attests to Hammond's important role in the campaign\u000a      and in countering negative perceptions of MSBs (10):\u000a    \"Dr Hammond's work and efforts have been invaluable to the Somali\u000a        community. Her research has made a significant contribution to raising\u000a        awareness of how remittances constitute a lifeline for receivers in the\u000a        Somali territories. Her involvement in the campaign helped to develop\u000a        public understanding of the issue and it definitely contributed to\u000a        Barclays' decision to extend its deadline. Her research also helped to\u000a        shed light on how Dahabshiil operates, therefore challenging the view\u000a        that companies like ours support terrorism. Her dedication has gone\u000a        beyond the academic and her efforts are truly appreciated\".\u000a    Hammond's research into the little-understood remittance pipeline to the\u000a      Somali territories reveals how money from abroad contributes to the\u000a      recovery of one of the world's longest-running failed states. The\u000a      accessibility of her work has facilitated its use by NGOs, charities and\u000a      diaspora groups in their fight to protect the remittance flow, thereby\u000a      influencing policymakers and banks globally. Moreover, Hammond's personal\u000a      involvement in the campaign illustrates her devotion to her work; as Mary\u000a      Harper has noted: \"She is more than an academic &#8212; she is able to\u000a      communicate with the wider public and is actively involved in the issues\u000a      about which she writes.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Remittances to the Somali territories and money transfer companies in the\u000a      region have long been viewed with distrust by banking regulators, who see\u000a      them as a conduit for terrorist financing. SOAS research into remittance\u000a      flows in the Somali territories helps address such distrust, revealing\u000a      that remittances are used primarily for basic needs, while larger\u000a      donations finance projects that contribute to the re-building of a region\u000a      riven by conflict. Following a decision by Barclays to close accounts of\u000a      UK money service providers operating in Somali territories, SOAS research\u000a      has been critical to an NGO-led campaign garnering widespread support to\u000a      keep remittance channels open.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    SOAS\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"School of Oriental and African Studies","InstitutionName":"School of Oriental & African Studies","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007780}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aa. \"Family Ties: Remittances and Livelihoods Support in Puntland and\u000a      Somaliland.\" Report commissioned by UN's Food Security and Nutrition\u000a      Analysis Unit, 2013.\u000a    \u000a\u000ab. \"Somali Transnational Activism and Integration in the UK: Mutually\u000a      Supporting Strategies.\" Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies\u000a      39\/6 (2013): 1001-17.\u000a    \u000a\u000ac. \"The Absent but Active Constituency: The Role of the Somaliland UK\u000a      Community in Electoral Politics.\" In Global Migration and\u000a        Transnational Processes, edited by Peter Mandaville and Terrence S.\u000a      Lyons, 227-59.

Hammond's research interests include food security,\u000a      conflict, forced migration and diasporas, regionally focused on the Horn\u000a      of Africa, particularly Ethiopia and Somalia, where she lived between 1993\u000a      and 1999. She began researching outward, voluntary and forced migration\u000a      from Somali territories in 1998 and soon became interested in how\u000a      remittances not only provided a lifeline for those who remained in the\u000a      Horn, but also facilitated and strengthened long-distance social\u000a      relationships. This interest motivated the writing of her 2010 article\u000a      (output e), which examines the pressures placed upon Somali immigrants and\u000a      refugees to support relatives back home, while simultaneously highlighting\u000a      how remittances inform the life decisions of both senders and receivers.\u000a      This work is mutually reinforced by the research of Lindley, whose 2010\u000a      monograph (output f) showcases her complementary approach, and has enabled\u000a      fruitful collaborations and exchanges of ideas with Hammond.\u000a    Hammond's initial work on remittances heavily informed her subsequent\u000a      role as Team Leader on a major international collaborative study on\u000a      diaspora organisations, commissioned by UNDP-Somalia, the principal output\u000a      of which was an extensive 2011 co-authored report (output d). The study,\u000a      based on quantitative and qualitative research undertaken across the\u000a      Somali territories and in six global cities with large diaspora\u000a      communities, investigates how remittances provide vital funding for relief\u000a      and development activities. Hammond further examines remittance\u000a      destinations in a 2012 article (output c), arguing that the victory of an\u000a      opposition candidate in the 2010 Somaliland presidential elections owed\u000a      much to donations and expertise provided by the diaspora.\u000a    Hammond's most significant output, however, is the 2013 report\u000a      commissioned by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's Food Security\u000a      and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU), `Family Ties: Remittances and\u000a      Livelihoods Support in Puntland and Somaliland'. Hammond was the Principal\u000a      Investigator and Lead Author on this study that assesses the demographics\u000a      of remittance receivers, the economic and social impacts of remittances,\u000a      and the timings of remittance flows. She gained unprecedented access to\u000a      data held by Dahabshiil, the largest money transfer company operating in\u000a      the Somali territories, and conducted a survey of 718 families in urban\u000a      and rural Somaliland and Puntland. The research built on extant\u000a      urban-centred studies of remittance receipts and spending habits to\u000a      demonstrate that rural economies too are heavily influenced by\u000a      remittances, which are often shared throughout communities, and are\u000a      largely used to meet basic needs.\u000a    By underlining the centrality of remittances to supporting the\u000a      livelihoods of Somalis as well as broader relief and development\u000a      activities, this research challenges the view that diaspora groups\u000a      primarily serve factional interests and that money service businesses\u000a      (MSBs) potentially buttress terrorism and\/or conflict. Instead it argues\u000a      that remittances are crucial to sustaining and re-building a region\u000a      ravaged by decades of violent conflict and political unrest, and promotes\u000a      a more nuanced understanding of the use of money channelled from the\u000a      Somali diaspora.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42795","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The measured, objective analysis of the Malawi programme disseminated\u000a      through the many publications, reports and briefing papers of Dorward and\u000a      his team have elicited widespread interest amongst a great range of\u000a      Malawian and international stakeholders, resulting in extensive policy\u000a      engagement at many levels.\u000a    In Malawi, Dorward and his team have provided annual monitoring reports\u000a      on FISP implementation and the estimated costs and returns to the\u000a      programme since 2007. These have been received by policy makers at the\u000a      Malawi Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, by DFID in Malawi, who\u000a      funds the reports' production, and by other international and national\u000a      agencies in Malawi. These reports are complemented by frequent, regular\u000a      meetings, presentations and workshops involving senior agricultural and\u000a      economic policy makers, civil society representatives, development\u000a      partners, NGOs and private sector seed and fertilizer suppliers. In\u000a      addition, papers and policy briefing papers on specific issues such as\u000a      improving targeting to potential subsidy recipients, gender impacts of the\u000a      programme, and private sector engagement have been provided to different\u000a      domestic stakeholders and international and bilateral donors. Since\u000a      January 2008 Dorward has participated in no fewer than 8 review workshops\u000a      and a large number of informal meetings in Malawi and authored or\u000a      co-authored 11 briefing papers with a primarily in-country audience.\u000a    A number of changes recommended in and specific to these reports and\u000a      briefings have been made to the programme (1 and 2 below), including:\u000a    \u000a      Changes to the allocation of subsidised inputs between and within\u000a        districts were recommended in 2008 (to improve programme effectiveness,\u000a        efficiency, and equity of programme impacts), and have been\u000a        progressively implemented in annual allocations since then;\u000a      The removal of cash crop subsidies for tobacco was recommended\u000a        repeatedly until it was implemented in 2009;\u000a      Improved targeting of subsidised inputs for efficiency and equity\u000a        reasons was recommended in 2008 and there is evidence of increased,\u000a        though still inadequate, access to subsidised inputs by women and\u000a        vulnerable and poorer households\u000a    \u000a    Other changes have been recommended by the team alongside other\u000a      stakeholders and have been adopted to a greater or lesser extent over the\u000a      life of the programme. These include earlier programming of all\u000a      activities, public listing of beneficiaries (adopted in 2012), lesson\u000a      learning from successful local innovations, improved coupon security\u000a      features, improved cost control, greater involvement of small scale\u000a      `agrodealers' in subsidised seed sales, and increased provision of\u000a      subsidised legume seeds. Changes repeatedly recommended and not\u000a      implemented for a variety of (often political) reasons include some\u000a      aspects of targeting, increased farmer contributions for inputs, and\u000a      private sector engagement in subsidised fertiliser sales.\u000a    The team has also provided unique, consistent and comprehensive\u000a      information, performance indicators, and commentary on the changing\u000a      implementation and impacts of this unique and major programme from its\u000a      inception, drawing on a unique integration of empirical and theoretical\u000a      understanding of complex implementation and impact processes.\u000a    The success of Dorward's team in chronicling the successes and challenges\u000a      of the FISP and proffering sound and relevant policy advice is\u000a      corroborated by the citation of the research by programme funders. DFID\u000a      has cited Dorward's findings extensively in internal programme documents\u000a      justifying continued FISP investments. In November 2009 the Head DFID's\u000a      Malawi Office cited the work of Dorward and the team when testifying to\u000a      the UK Parliament Public Accounts Committee (3). The same year, the UK\u000a      National Audit Office also referred to the research in its evaluation of\u000a      the Malawi DfID programme (4).\u000a    Outside Malawi, Dorward and his team members have presented papers on\u000a      input subsidies and the FISP programme at many wider African agricultural\u000a      policy meetings, including at events sponsored by AGRA (Alliance for a\u000a      Green Revolution in Africa), the Gates Foundation in Africa and the Future\u000a      Agricultures Consortium, on whose website Dorward and his colleagues have\u000a      made a number of published, working and policy papers freely available.\u000a      Since 2008, Dorward has presented his research on the FISP at five\u000a      regional agricultural development meetings in Africa, one occasion\u000a      involving the Kenyan Minister of Agriculture.\u000a    The World Bank (6, 10), OECD, FAO (5, 11) and other international\u000a      organisations have invited Dorward to present their research findings\u000a      and\/or have commissioned them to write papers on specific topics related\u000a      to the implementation and development of the FISP (see for example output\u000a      e and f).\u000a    The research of Dorward and his collaborators has made a substantial\u000a      contribution to changes in attitudes towards agricultural input subsidies\u000a      - helping to provide sceptics with theoretical explanations of context\u000a      specific subsidy contributions and objective evidence of the Malawi\u000a      programme's performance, and moderating the support from subsidy\u000a      proponents with evidence of the subsidies' weaknesses, thereby providing\u000a      all stakeholders with theoretical and empirical ground for exploration.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Achieving self-sufficiency in food production is a priority of the Malawi\u000a      government.

He has long-term\u000a      interests in the livelihoods of poor rural people, in particular problems\u000a      associated with seasonality, market access, institutions, and the\u000a      interactions of agricultural and other activities in rural economies.\u000a      Before joining SOAS in 2007, he worked at Imperial College's Wye Campus.\u000a    During the 1980s and 90s government sponsored agricultural subsidies for\u000a      farmers were conventionally considered to be costly, inefficient,\u000a      ineffective and even counterproductive instruments for agricultural\u000a      development and growth in developing countries. Since 2000, this view has\u000a      been increasingly challenged by African governments and policy analysts\u000a      critical of continued lack of growth in African agriculture. At the same\u000a      time, new thinking on the role of government investment in `kick starting\u000a      markets' emerged, as did a new generation of market-friendly and time-\u000a      limited subsidies.\u000a    Dorward has led an international team researching the implementation and\u000a      impact of the Malawi Agricultural Input Subsidy Programme, later called\u000a      the Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP), introduced in 2005. From 2007 to\u000a      2010 the team included researchers from the University of Malawi, the\u000a      Overseas Development Institute and Michigan State University, and from\u000a      2010 to 2013 from SOAS and the University of Malawi (with researchers from\u000a      University of California, Berkeley, from 2013).\u000a    The team's research has provided theoretical and historical underpinnings\u000a      for a markedly different understanding of the potential contribution of\u000a      subsidies to agricultural development and growth in poor rural economies\u000a      like Malawi's, with significant implications for programme design and\u000a      implementation. This foundational research has involved rigorous empirical\u000a      analysis of the implementation and impacts of the programme. FISP is\u000a      highly politicised within Malawi, where it was initially a core part of\u000a      the former President's re-election strategy, and internationally, where\u000a      extravagant claims of success were used to decry conventional neo-liberal\u000a      policies while scepticism about such claims led to scepticism about the\u000a      entire programme. As team leader, Dorward was both a critical driver of\u000a      and participant in this work - conducting reviews, developing new\u000a      theoretical insights, providing conceptual frameworks, leading the design\u000a      of a household survey, and implementing rural livelihood and economy\u000a      models, as well as leading interactions with the policy community.\u000a    An early review (output f) enhanced understanding of the strengths and\u000a      failings of subsidies in different contexts, the features of 'smart'\u000a      subsidies, potential impacts on wider development and broad based growth\u000a      as well as food availability, and political economy influences on such\u000a      programmes. Research has also focussed on the negative consequences of and\u000a      potential programme impacts on a `low productivity trap' associated with\u000a      Malawi's maize dependency and its cultivation by very poor\u000a      semi-subsistence farmers.\u000a    A distinguishing feature of Dorward's analysis is an emphasis on the role\u000a      of subsidies in addressing affordability constraints on farmers,\u000a      arising from financial market failures. This contrasts with more\u000a      conventional analysis of subsidies addressing profitability\u000a      constraints on farmers, arising from adverse prices and poor communication\u000a      of key information. Also significant is Dorward's investigation of\u000a      indirect benefits, including critical impacts on labour and maize markets.\u000a      Also significant is Dorward and the team's investigation of gendered\u000a      access and impacts (output d) and indirect benefits, including critical\u000a      impacts on rural wages and maize prices.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42797","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since its publication in 2010, The Millennium Development Goals: A\u000d\u000a        Cross-sectoral Analysis and Principles for Goal Setting after 2015\u000d\u000a      has been widely cited and circulated internationally by the UN, global\u000d\u000a      charities, NGOs, think tanks and government ministries abroad.

Professor Jeff Waage,\u000d\u000a      Director of LIDC, provided intellectual leadership for the project as a\u000d\u000a      whole and evaluated MDG 7, on Environmental Sustainability.\u000d\u000a    All three have published extensively on agriculture and the environment\u000d\u000a      and their relationship to global development, first at Imperial College,\u000d\u000a      and, since 2007, at SOAS: Dorward and Poulton have researched the\u000d\u000a      contributions of agricultural development to poverty reduction and\u000d\u000a      economic growth (eg output e), while Waage has focussed on environmental\u000d\u000a      issues in developing countries. The three have collaborated on different\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary projects linking these themes with health. In 2010,\u000d\u000a      Waage co-authored with Sir Gordon Conway, then Chief Scientist at DFID, Science\u000d\u000a        and Innovation for Development, which used the MDGs as a framework\u000d\u000a      for exploring the role of science in reducing poverty (output d).\u000d\u000a    Each member of the project team for the Lancet study was an expert in at\u000d\u000a      least one of the MDGs and undertook a detailed analysis of the design of\u000d\u000a      the assigned MDG and of subsequent performance. These analyses were\u000d\u000a      compared in inter-sectoral workshops to identify emergent, common features\u000d\u000a      of MDG performance and to build an inter-sectoral consensus on future\u000d\u000a      goal-setting. The surprising finding was that most MDGs encountered three\u000d\u000a      similar problems relating to limited scope, ownership, and equitability of\u000d\u000a      implementation. The team used these findings to establish a universal\u000d\u000a      objective for future goal-setting and six principles for designing new\u000d\u000a      goals. A particular aim was to remedy the lack of integration and of\u000d\u000a      common purpose and process in existing MDGs.\u000d\u000a    The Lancet Commission was published shortly before the UN summit\u000d\u000a      evaluating progress against MDGs in September 2010. Besides this strategic\u000d\u000a      timing, the publication carried particular weight because of the high\u000d\u000a      impact of The Lancet and the importance of health goals amongst\u000d\u000a      the MDGs. A number of other institutions also prepared statements on\u000d\u000a      future MDGs, but few undertook such comprehensive research projects and\u000d\u000a      none engaged specialists from different sectors in studies that were\u000d\u000a      cross-sectoral and cross-MDG. Most studies also focused on political\u000d\u000a      context and relation to development theory, not on the delivery of\u000d\u000a      specific outcomes.\u000d\u000a    The continued necessity and demand for research on MDGs and their\u000d\u000a      evaluation have prompted Andrew Dorward to work and publish further on\u000d\u000a      this subject (outputs a and b) with a particular contribution on thinking\u000d\u000a      about sustainable development targets and indicators in agriculture and\u000d\u000a      food security (output a).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42800","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2245662","Name":"Senegal"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Mosse's work has been widely read and highly cited by international\u000a      development agencies, both official and NGO, and has significantly\u000a      contributed to major development programme planning and policy debate\u000a      among these and other stakeholders. Cultivating Development in\u000a      particular offers the aid sector something unprecedented: a detailed,\u000a      reflective insider analysis of longer-term processes of development\u000a      interventions. The book has provided an analytical approach to policy and\u000a      practice across fields ranging from community health to climate change,\u000a      forestry reform to microfinance (evidenced in the span of the 765 Google\u000a      citations). (1) The impact is not simply dissemination of anthropological\u000a      research on institutional processes, but enabling development\u000a      practitioners themselves to reflect in new ways on their own professional\u000a      and institutional experiences.\u000a    Early impacts of Mosse's work through World Bank and DFID learning\u000a      organisation seminars in 2002 and 2003 were extended and deepened in the\u000a      post-publication current REF assessment period. In 2008, on the basis of Cultivating\u000a        Development's contributions to better understanding community-driven\u000a      approaches to development, Mosse was invited by the World Bank to spend a\u000a      full month reviewing the work of its extensive (part DFID sponsored)\u000a      Social Development programme in Indonesia, with a view to improving the\u000a      new National Programme for Community Empowerment (PNPM), which had become\u000a      pivotal to the government's national programme for poverty reduction.\u000a    More recently, his critical work on participatory development contributed\u000a      significantly to the 2013 World Bank Policy Research Report \"Localizing\u000a      Development: Does Participation Work?,\" which cites Mosse and most often\u000a      the arguments forwarded in Cultivating Development no less than 29\u000a      times. (2)\u000a    Further corroboration of significant impact on the World Bank is provided\u000a      in a testimonial from Scott Guggenheim, a senior social policy specialist\u000a      at the World Bank before becoming a senior social specialist for the\u000a      Australian government, (3) and recently being seconded back to the World\u000a      Bank, who has described Cultivating Development as:\u000a    \"A superb book, one of those rarities that can change entire ways of\u000a        thinking. David Mosse is the first social scientist in a generation who\u000a        can successfully take cutting-edge insights from academic anthropology\u000a        and use them to explain practical problems in development.\"\u000a    Guggenheim has further encouraged his own staff to read the book and\u000a      applied its ideas to do team-based exercises at the organisations he has\u000a      worked for:\u000a    \"We used Dr. Mosse's writings to do a hands-on exercise of trying to\u000a        distinguish what we needed to really make programs work from what we\u000a        needed so that our head office and the government could approve them.\u000a        The results were striking.\"\u000a    Even more significantly, Guggenheim writes:\u000a    \"Dr. Mosse's work has been fundamental to the analytical framework\u000a        that our team has been using to guide these [two] massive programs....\u000a        The Afghanistan program &#8212; it's called National Solidarity &#8212; is far and\u000a        away the largest development program produced over the course of the\u000a        international period there. It reaches 30,000 communities in every part\u000a        of the country, has disbursed over US$1.1 billion, and has been a\u000a        foundation program for all of the donors hoping to help Afghanistan\u000a        survive its difficult transition, including both the civilian and\u000a        diplomatic wings of the British government. Reaching a total population\u000a        of 90 million poor people spread over three time zones, the Indonesian\u000a        program is even larger &#8212; it is the president of Indonesia's flagship\u000a        poverty program and has been the fulcrum for how the Indonesian\u000a        government has responded to both chronic crises such as the 2004 Aceh\u000a        tsunami and to the difficult challenges of transition from a military to\u000a        a democratic government.\"\u000a    In China (at the Beijing China Agricultural University) applied social\u000a      scientists have sought to use Mosse's approach to develop policy-relevant\u000a      analysis of development practice within China, and Chinese aid abroad. In\u000a      2008 Mosse was invited to run a development research workshop, to review\u000a      programmes in Ningxia, Chengdu and Jiangxi. In 2013, he was invited to\u000a      join the 8-person International Advisory Committee of the DFID-supported\u000a      China International Development Research Network promoting knowledge-based\u000a      policy development for Chinese development aid. Membership includes three\u000a      of China's most powerful institutions providing policy advice directly to\u000a      government: the Department of Development Aid, Chinese Academy of\u000a      International Trade and Economic Cooperation, Ministry of Commerce; The\u000a      China Center for Contemporary World Studies, International Department of\u000a      Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; and the Institute for\u000a      International Strategic Studies, Party School of the Central Committee of\u000a      the Communist Party of China. (4)\u000a    Mosse's research has generated significant discussion and debate\u000a      internationally, in development circles and more broadly. A particularly\u000a      notable recent instance appeared in the publication of conference\u000a      proceedings in a double-page spread in a leading national daily newspaper\u000a      in Senegal, Wal Fadjri L'Aurore, which has a daily print\u000a      circulation of 20,000. (5) Speaking about the shift in focus of anglophone\u000a      anthropological studies of development away from how policy is applied to\u000a      how it comes to be formulated in the first instance by international\u000a      actors, French anthropologist Jean Copans contends :\u000a    \"Un chercheur symbolise, selon nous, cette nouvelle perspective, David\u000a        Mosse (...)

Central to this work is the\u000a      development of concepts, methods and the application of anthropological\u000a      analysis to international development programming.\u000a    Cultivating Development: An Ethnography of Aid Policy and Practice\u000a      of 2005 (output a) addresses the complex relationship between policy\u000a      intention and programme practice in development aid, the often unintended\u000a      outcomes and the unexpected role of development models, expertise, and\u000a      evaluation processes. It also offers close examination of the practice and\u000a      effects of new participatory planning approaches in development, begun in\u000a      earlier research, evidenced in output b. The research was undertaken over\u000a      12 years (1991-2003, both before and during Mosse's time at SOAS) through\u000a      long-term involvement in and ethnographic study of rural development\u000a      programmes in western India and international policy communities. Its\u000a      impact has been felt most strongly since 2007-8.\u000a    An important (although controversial) finding of the book was that the\u000a      processes that make for `good' and successful policy are not the same as\u000a      those that make its implementation possible. Rather than a prescription\u000a      for effective action, policy is primarily the means to enrol political and\u000a      other supporters. Mosse demonstrates how the actions of development\u000a      workers are actually shaped by the exigencies of organisations and the\u000a      need to maintain relationships rather than by policy; but also how\u000a      development actors at all levels work hardest to maintain coherent\u000a      representations of their actions as instances of authorised policy. These\u000a      finding are widely applicable in terms of rethinking the `gap' between\u000a      policy and practice, agency evaluations of programme success or failure,\u000a      the social-institutional effects of policy change and understanding\u000a      development impacts.\u000a    Mosse further developed the implications of this research in two volumes\u000a      and a journal special issue co-edited with David Lewis (outputs c, d and\u000a      e), and a more recent sole-edited volume, Adventures in Aidland of\u000a      2011 (output f) in which he also analyses policy knowledge processes at\u000a      the World Bank based on his work as the first anthropologist to hold a\u000a      visiting fellowship in the Bank's research department (2003-4). The edited\u000a      volumes bring together as contributors anthropologists with professional\u000a      experience in development to demonstrate across several instances how the\u000a      ethnography of development can shed light on the disjuncture between\u000a      policy and practice, and the critical role of brokers and translators in\u000a      development. The Aid Effect, in particular, demonstrates that\u000a      ethnographic insights are relevant not only for discrete projects across\u000a      different sectors but also for the execution of macro-level frameworks for\u000a      policy reform, poverty reduction and `good governance; and Adventures\u000a        in Aidland shows how the effectiveness of public policy knowledge is\u000a      influenced by the manner in which it is embedded in institutional\u000a      relationships and interests, and by the sociality of development\u000a      professionals.\u000a    As a body of work this has contributed to critical awareness of policy\u000a      and institutional processes in international development, demonstrating\u000a      the ease with which cross-cultural interactions and their impacts can be\u000a      misconceived by development policy frameworks including those explicitly\u000a      promoting participatory approaches.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43358","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research outlined above, along with Mills' role as\u000a      Co-Director of the Scottish Centre for Himalayan Research, was what led to\u000a      his being invited to act as the principal academic advisor to the Scottish\u000a      Parliament's Cross-Party Group on Tibet. This invitation was made on the\u000a      grounds of Mills' experience and involvement regarding the Tibetan\u000a      'Shugden controversy' from 1996-2003 (Mills 2003b), for which he carried\u000a      out research between 1993 and 2003, wrote an internal assessment for\u000a      Amnesty International following human rights allegations made by\u000a      worshippers of the deity, and dealt with media inquiries. Mills'\u000a      works (Mills 2003b and 2009) now represent major sources for public and\u000a      scholarly debate on this controversy.\u000a    In more specific terms, the research above contributed to the production\u000a      of four briefing papers for the Scottish Parliament's Cross Party Group on\u000a      Tibet in the following ways:\u000a    (1): Research Projects 1 and 2 (see above), and in particular the work on\u000a      the role and status of incarnate lamas within the authority structure of\u000a      Tibetan religious schools, contributed directly to the 2010 paper\u000a      \"Religious Policy and State Control in Tibet\", which outlined the\u000a      influence and structure of new Peoples' Republic of China regulations on\u000a      the recognition of incarnate lamas in Tibet.\u000a    (2): Project 3 (see above) involved substantial initial research into the\u000a      1987-90 protests in Tibet, and provided essential background data to the\u000a      demographic, geographical and ideological shifts represented by the 2008\u000a      protests examined in the parliamentary briefing paper, \"The 2008 Protests\u000a      in Tibet: Main Facts and Analysis\". The core conclusions of this paper\u000a      were presented to a closed meeting of scholars, Foreign Office officials\u000a      and representatives of human rights organisations at the University of\u000a      Cambridge in May 2008. It was later reproduced in abridged form by the\u000a      internationally-distributed Students for a Free Tibet Newsletter (http:\/\/data5.blog.de\/media\/521\/2541521_bbfe98e4f0_d.pdf).\u000a    (3): Project 3 also involved substantial research on the history and form\u000a      of Tibetan claims to sovereignty and governance, and the difficulties of\u000a      squaring these with the modern constitutional claims of nation-states.\u000a      This history, and the constitutional problems implied, formed the basis\u000a      for some of the recommendations in the 2009 briefing paper, \"Issues of\u000a      Sovereignty in the Sino-Tibetan Dispute\".\u000a    (4): Research Project 4 (see above) contributed directly to the\u000a      production of the fourth briefing paper on recent Tibetan\u000a      self-immolations, which was ratified by the Cross Party Group on Tibet in\u000a      June 2012, from where it was disseminated to Scottish MPs, human rights\u000a      organisations, newspapers and Tibet organisations. Because of the urgency\u000a      of the issue, the briefing paper was produced simultaneously with the\u000a      development of academic research papers which are currently still in\u000a      production, but which were initially presented at the South Asian\u000a      Anthropologists Group seminar in Edinburgh in September 2012. The key\u000a      findings of this research were also formally presented to the Scottish\u000a      Parliament's Cross Party Group on Tibet and attendant members of the UK\u000a      Human Rights organisations on the 6th June 2012.\u000a    The first three of these papers were presented as evidence to the Foreign\u000a      Affairs Select Committee of the UK Parliament by the Tibet Support Group\u000a      in 2009.

This work sought to understand the\u000a      difficulties of applying modern political and human rights theory to\u000a      Tibetan constitutional affairs, and outlined instead the means by which\u000a      ritual performance and authority provided 'passive' forms of political\u000a      control.\u000a    (3): Further research at the University of Aberdeen from 2003 to 2010\u000a      focused on the constitutional history of Tibet. Particular attention was\u000a      paid to understanding the history of the Dalai Lamas as the centrepiece of\u000a      a coherent set of constitutional ideas beyond mere religious charisma, and\u000a      as inheritors of Tibet's larger mythic history. This latter research\u000a      included a three-month research trip to Lhasa in the Summer of 2004, and\u000a      the extensive translation of Tibetan historical sources. This research has\u000a      sought to bring theoretical clarity to the role of the 'ceremonial state'\u000a      as a basis for Tibetan ideas of legitimate governance, and has clarified\u000a      our understanding of the Dalai Lamas within Tibet's wider constitutional\u000a      milieu. This research was funded by the University of Aberdeen, the\u000a      Carnegie Trust, the Frederick Williamson Memorial Fund, and the AHRC\u000a      Research Leave Scheme.\u000a    (4): From January to April 2012, Mills carried out research at\u000a      the University of Aberdeen amongst Tibetan refugee communities in\u000a      North-West India. This included research with the Tibetan\u000a      Government-in-Exile on democratic reform and on the recent spate of\u000a      self-immolations. The first of these was designed to elucidate Tibetan\u000a      understandings of democratic governance in the post-Dalai Lama context.\u000a      Overwhelmingly, this research demonstrated the enormous difficulties that\u000a      the Tibetan refugee elite had in constitutionally separating themselves\u000a      from the Dalai Lama's religious and political mandate, and how this was\u000a      moulding the constitutional reform process. Research on self-immolations\u000a      concentrated on two aspects: firstly, the relatively novel creation of\u000a      narratives of national patriotism amongst the last testaments of Tibetan\u000a      immolators themselves and the links between this and the Chinese\u000a      government's 'patriotic education campaigns' in Tibet throughout the last\u000a      twenty years; and secondly, the contrast between this and the statistical\u000a      rise of self-immolations within the Peoples' Republic of China as a whole\u000a      during the same period as those in Tibetan regions. In short,\u000a      self-immolation appears to be a Chinese mode of local resistance which has\u000a      been adopted by Tibetans in the last few years in accordance with a\u000a      distinctly Tibetan narrative.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43359","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Public talks were held from 2005 onwards in locations as diverse as the\u000d\u000a      Stromness Museum, Orkney (The Orkney Historical Society), the Village\u000d\u000a      Hall, Stuartfield, Aberdeenshire (The Buchan Field Club), and the Elders\u000d\u000a      Centre, Thompson Manitoba (Honekwe Oral History Gathering).

The curatorial team worked closely with members of\u000d\u000a      the public who had responded to a press release regarding their own family\u000d\u000a      connection with the fur trade to develop text panels that highlighted the\u000d\u000a      experiences of individuals within the broader context of changes in the\u000d\u000a      northern fur trade. The exhibition was aimed at the general public and ran\u000d\u000a      for approximately three months. It was attended by approximately 7000\u000d\u000a      visitors. The exhibition raised the profile of the Material Histories\u000d\u000a      project, drew the attention of visitors to the historic and economic links\u000d\u000a      between Scotland and Canada, and enabled students in the Department of\u000d\u000a      Anthropology to gain experience of research and curation by assisting with\u000d\u000a      the exhibition's development.\u000d\u000a    (2): Material Histories: Scots and Aboriginal Peoples in the\u000d\u000a          Canadian Fur Trade.

Brown continues to\u000d\u000a      receive emails about the project via the website at least once a month,\u000d\u000a      mostly from people requesting help in locating fur trade ancestors. In\u000d\u000a      April 2012, for example, a Canadian emailed to say, \"I have just\u000d\u000a      discovered your work posted on ABDN website and I want you to know that I\u000d\u000a      really appreciate it.

As an educator,\u000d\u000a      Christine Massan, from Fox Lake Cree Nation, Manitoba, has been a keen\u000d\u000a      supporter of the project and co-authored a book chapter with Brown\u000d\u000a      about her own family's fur trade connections. She is involved in Cultural\u000d\u000a      Awareness training for employees of companies such as Manitoba Hydro,\u000d\u000a      Ducks Unlimited, Comstock, which have a presence in Northern Manitoba for\u000d\u000a      the construction of dams. She has also used the research as the basis for\u000d\u000a      presentations to school students in her own community, many of whom are\u000d\u000a      struggling to find positive role models. Finally, she is in the early\u000d\u000a      stages of developing a film, with Cree actor and director Michael\u000d\u000a      Lawrenchuk, based on the research.\u000d\u000a    (4): Film\/television\u000d\u000a      Several media productions in the early stages of development will draw on\u000d\u000a      aspects of the research. Cree actor and director Michael Lawrenchuk, from\u000d\u000a      Fox Lake First Nation, Manitoba, Canada, has proposed developing a film\u000d\u000a      based on the lives of a family with ties to his community whose story was\u000d\u000a      uncovered during the Material Histories project. In addition,\u000d\u000a      there have been some preliminary discussions with the BBC to develop a\u000d\u000a      documentary featuring one of the families researched during the project.\u000d\u000a      This follows from the screening of an Antiques Roadshow episode\u000d\u000a      (televised on 30.02.2008) in which one of the individuals who worked with\u000d\u000a      Brown on the project participated.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Recent calls from indigenous peoples for information about and access to\u000d\u000a      historic artefacts crucial to their well-being have led to a re-evaluation\u000d\u000a      of both private and museum-held collections.

The project focused on how artefacts could contribute to fur trade\u000d\u000a      narratives that are otherwise excluded from the written record. Most fur\u000d\u000a      trade research is undertaken in Canada, but this project provided an\u000d\u000a      opportunity to locate under-researched artefacts in Scottish museums and\u000d\u000a      private collections, thus offering new insights into the material flows of\u000d\u000a      artefacts during the historic fur trade era.\u000d\u000a    The research involved oral history interviews with people from northern\u000d\u000a      Manitoba (Canada), Orkney and Northeast Scotland, as well as\u000d\u000a      artefact-based research drawing on private and museum collections, and\u000d\u000a      archival research in the collections of the Hudson's Bay Company, the\u000d\u000a      National Archives of Scotland, and other sources.

This\u000d\u000a      workshop has helped curators better to interpret such materials in the\u000d\u000a      museums in which they work.\u000d\u000a    Key outcomes of the research included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Identification of previously unknown historic artefacts, photographic\u000d\u000a        collections, and archival documents pertaining to the fur trade.

Since 2010, for example, Khan has been a member of the\u000a      Committee of Experts on Public Administration at the UN, a geographically\u000a      diverse, select group of 24 specialists that supports the Economic and\u000a      Social Council in promoting and developing public administration and\u000a      governance in Member States. The Committee meets annually in New York.\u000a      Khan, a representative of Bangladesh, has made numerous recommendations\u000a      that are referred to in reports of the committee (1 and 2, below).\u000a    Khan's expertise has also been solicited by DFID in various research,\u000a      educational and training capacities since 2008, including research and\u000a      briefings on South Asia, anti-corruption, growth and governance. Between\u000a      2007 and 2010, Khan was Research Leader on DFID's `Governance for Growth'\u000a      project that investigated how certain countries, largely in Asia, have\u000a      transformed their economies to achieve sustained economic growth without\u000a      fulfilling `good governance' requirements (3, 4). This work, and\u000a      particularly the analysis of political settlements, has influenced a\u000a      number of other major DFID-funded projects on governance. Khan's influence\u000a      on DFID is confirmed by Max Everest-Phillips (5), formerly responsible for\u000a      DFID's Development Advice and Policy and currently Director of the UNDP\u000a      Global Centre for Public Service Excellence, who contends that Khan's work\u000a      has also impacted upon the World Bank's approach:\u000a    \"Khan is the most influential person in the UK working on governance\u000a        and development. He challenges orthodoxy in a very effective way. His\u000a        ideas fed into DFID policy, but he also pushed the World Bank to be less\u000a        prescriptive and more open to different ideas, models.\"\u000a    Khan's impact on the World Bank is corroborated by his invitations to\u000a      participate in numerous World Bank meetings and missions. He is a member\u000a      of the World Bank's Panel of Experts on Policy Implementation, (informally\u000a      called the Brains Trust) since 2012. This panel, comprised of four eminent\u000a      academics working on governance and institutions, advises the World Bank's\u000a      Finance and Private Sector Development team on achievable institutional\u000a      and governance reforms for industrial policy. Thus far, it has assisted\u000a      the Planning Commission of India with their Manufacturing Plan. In a\u000a      letter from Ivan Rossignol of the World Bank (6), it was stated that\u000a      Khan's invitation to the Panel was based on his position as `a leading\u000a      thinker on questions of institutions, governance, how to achieve growth in\u000a      practice and on what makes for effective real-world policy.'\u000a    As a result of Khan's work on governance and the 'political settlement'\u000a      in Bangladesh (output d), he was involved in the World Bank's 2010 mission\u000a      to Bangladesh on power sector reforms. Khan's work on political\u000a      settlements fed into the policy advice provided to the Bangladesh\u000a      government.\u000a    A large part of Khan's work outside academe has been conducted in close\u000a      collaboration with the French AFD. He has participated in the\u000a      AFD-sponsored `African Programme on Re-thinking Development Economies'\u000a      (APORDE) since 2007, a South African Department of Trade and Industry\u000a      initiative, comprising a two-week seminar series involving policy makers\u000a      and civil society representatives from Africa, Asia and Latin America,\u000a      exploring alternatives to mainstream approaches to development issues so\u000a      as to promote original, dynamic thinking.\u000a    He has also contributed substantially to a long-standing AFD project that\u000a      examines institutions, governance and growth in developing countries,\u000a      including India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Khan's work has greatly\u000a      influenced AFD policy and the policy advice it provides developing\u000a      countries, as confirmed by Nicolas Meisel, Senior Programme Manager in the\u000a      AFD's Research Department:\u000a    \"I have observed that, in the aid industry, Khan's work has been\u000a        increasingly cited over the past 5 years. He has added a lot to the\u000a        field, especially through his papers for DFID on governance capabilities\u000a        for managing industrial transformation in developing countries. Khan has\u000a        a strong, long-term relationship with AFD. The domain of ideas put\u000a        forward in his work on governance and political settlements has\u000a        influenced the planning of new instruments, policies and programmes at\u000a        AFD\" (7, 8).\u000a    Together with Meisel, Khan has also offered policy advice directly to\u000a      governments in developing countries. For instance, in 2013, he presented\u000a      at a four-hour roundtable with senior members of the Ethiopian government\u000a      including the Prime Minister, following which AFD received an official\u000a      request to further advise the country.\u000a    Further evidence of Khan's impact is demonstrated by the many references\u000a      to his research in reports published by leading development institutions,\u000a      for example the US Government Accountability Office, Developmental\u000a      Leadership Programme (Australia) (10), the Overseas Development Institute\u000a      (9), Asia Foundation, Netherlands Institute for International Relations,\u000a      Advisory Board for Irish Aid, Christian Aid (11) and Action Aid.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Mushtaq Khan's re-examination of the orthodox approach to good\u000a      governance - that sees `good governance' as a precursor for economic\u000a      growth - has significantly influenced long-term international development\u000a      funders, informing thinking, policy and practice through its sustained,\u000a      well-evidenced case that a different set of `developmental' governance\u000a      capabilities are required for economic growth in developing countries,\u000a      which in turn serves as an effective catalyst for achieving good\u000a      governance.

His research interests include\u000a      institutional economics, rents and rent-seeking, and the interdependencies\u000a      between governance, corruption and economic development. He has published\u000a      extensively, with several articles awarded the prestigious Hans Singer and\u000a      Frank Cass prizes. Drawing on his research, Khan has undertaken\u000a      consultancy for various international governments and development\u000a      organisations, and is a regular economics and development commentator for\u000a      BBC Bangla and Voice of America Bengali broadcasts.\u000a    Khan's work on governance and development has garnered much attention\u000a      internationally, largely due to its thorough, sustained critique of the\u000a      `good governance' agenda promoted by leading development actors and\u000a      institutions. The conventional understanding of good governance proposes\u000a      that, in order to maintain efficient markets and thus achieve economic\u000a      growth, developing countries must first meet certain governance-related\u000a      criteria, principally strengthening the rule of law, robust\u000a      anti-corruption measures, transparency in governance and democratic\u000a      accountability. Khan challenges this established view, arguing that a\u000a      closer analysis of economic theory and historical evidence reveals that\u000a      good governance has typically been a progressive outcome of a development\u000a      process, not something achieved at the beginning. Thus, while desirable,\u000a      the features of good governance are not necessarily preconditions for\u000a      development; rather, they can be the goals.\u000a    Khan's re-thinking of the orthodox approach to economic growth in\u000a      developing countries advocates a shift in the focus of governments and\u000a      economists towards achievable `developmental' governance capabilities,\u000a      based on both historical evidence of successful development and a more\u000a      nuanced understanding of the political arrangements of individual\u000a      developing countries, where aspects of political corruption are often\u000a      necessary for maintaining political stability. In this respect, Khan\u000a      places emphasis on the need for international actors to appreciate the\u000a      nature of `political settlements' in developing countries, referring to\u000a      the institutional and political arrangements that achieve political\u000a      stability in particular countries. Instead of a general and unachievable\u000a      focus on `good governance' Khan contends that a focus on the most damaging\u000a      types of corruption that can be feasibly attacked and the most important\u000a      developmental governance capabilities can help prevent developing\u000a      countries from being pushed to meet goals that are ultimately unachievable\u000a      or may even be damaging.\u000a    Khan questions the relationship between good governance and economic\u000a      growth in multiple outputs, beginning with a notable publication in 2004\u000a      (output a, published in several languages) which established the\u000a      importance of different types of governance, followed by a 2007 paper for\u000a      the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (output b). This paper\u000a      assesses empirical evidence from countries experiencing rapid growth in\u000a      the last fifty years to compare `market-enhancing' governance (the\u000a      mainstream good governance agenda) with what he terms `growth-enhancing'\u000a      or developmental governance. Khan identifies several growth-enhancing\u000a      governance capabilities: these include the capability to maintain\u000a      political stability during rapid social transformations, transform\u000a      property rights and transfer resources to more productive sectors, and to\u000a      effectively allocate resources to accelerate the adoption of\u000a      high-productivity technologies - and he shows how these capabilities have\u000a      been more important than market-enhancing governance capabilities in\u000a      sustaining economic growth. Khan's research continues to re-assess\u000a      governance, showcasing alternative evidence from several countries\u000a      (including Africa, see output c), Bangladesh (output d), Thailand (output\u000a      e), the implications for controlling global illicit capital flows (output\u000a      f), and developing an alternative policy agenda (output g).\u000a    Ultimately, Khan's research highlights the limitations of the predominant\u000a      good governance agenda, and how such limitations could lead to lost\u000a      opportunities for implementing reforms which have a greater potential of\u000a      success. Instead, he provides a framework for identifying a more context-\u000a      and country-specific set of developmental governance capabilities to\u000a      promote in the short- to medium- term that can more rapidly improve the\u000a      economic performance of developing nations.\u000a    "}]

The provision\u000d\u000a      of these directly related SLO\/OCT images is crucial in guiding\u000d\u000a      ophthalmologists in choosing the retina areas to be \"sampled\" by OCT. The\u000d\u000a      technology developed by the AOG was translated to industry through four\u000d\u000a      licence agreements. The first two below were to the benefit of patients\u000d\u000a      with eye disease, with the second in current commercial exploitation and\u000d\u000a      used by clinics worldwide. The latter two are at an earlier stage of\u000d\u000a      development, but demonstrate that researchers at Kent are continuing to\u000d\u000a      explore new ways of exploiting these technologies to create worldwide\u000d\u000a      impact in ophthalmology\/optometry.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Patent US5975697 by A. Podoleanu and D.A. Jackson (1998) has been\u000d\u000a        assigned to OTI, followed by a family of patents (A. Podoleanu plus AOG\u000d\u000a        members). This led to commercialisation of the OCT\/SLO instrument by OTI\u000d\u000a        worldwide, leading to revenue to the University and inventors exceeding\u000d\u000a        $300K in the period.\u000d\u000a      The patent on a sequential spectral OCT with SLO was the subject of an\u000d\u000a        agreement with OPKO in 2011 [6], with technology transferred to Optos.\u000d\u000a        They continue to exploit the technology commercially and maintain the\u000d\u000a        patent in good standing.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The implications of these instruments on health care professionals and\u000d\u000a      patients cannot be overstated [1]. The technology delivers new insight\u000d\u000a        into eye diseases by providing recognisable en-face patterns of specific\u000d\u000a        diseases [2], for example diabetic retinopathy, age- related\u000d\u000a      macular degeneration, glaucoma, stroke and heart disease [3]. Instruments\u000d\u000a      based on the technology covered by these patents are in use in eye clinics\u000d\u000a      worldwide. OCT SLO is a central product for Optos plc, whose shares have\u000d\u000a      grown by a factor 3 since 2008 and currently operates at around &#163;125\u000d\u000a      million annual revenue and 16m profit. A rise in revenue of 37% in the\u000d\u000a      past two years bringing valuable employment to Scotland. The company has\u000d\u000a      over 5,000 clinical users worldwide [5], although it does not make public\u000d\u000a      details on the price and exact numbers of OCT instruments described above\u000d\u000a      these can be checked [4] and cross-referenced with income from the patent\u000d\u000a      agreements to the university. This shoes that a large percentage of these\u000d\u000a      clinics have instruments produced directly as a result of the research\u000d\u000a      done by the Kent academics and covered by Kent patents and that on average\u000d\u000a      they have been installed for five years. Each instrument typically\u000d\u000a    treats around 1,000 patients per year. It is estimated that around 5\u000d\u000a        million patient diagnoses was aided by the application of our research\u000d\u000a      [4].\u000d\u000a    The other two licence agreements are at an earlier stage of development.\u000d\u000a      They demonstrate that researchers at Kent are continuing to explore ways\u000d\u000a      of developing these technologies to create worldwide impact in\u000d\u000a      ophthalmology\/optometry. \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Adaptive Optics technology applied to the OCT\/SLO has been developed,\u000d\u000a        assisted by EPSRC funding with input from the National University of\u000d\u000a        Ireland, Galway (Prof. C. Dainty). This has been licensed to OTI for\u000d\u000a        ophthalmology\/optometry. Optos plc maintains the patent and there is\u000d\u000a        on-going discussion between the parties on development and\u000d\u000a        commercialisation of the technology.\u000d\u000a      A method of spectral OCT without disturbing mirror terms has been\u000d\u000a        invented by A. Podoleanu. Spin-off company Optopod was created in 2005\u000d\u000a        by Podoleanu, (Director). Optopod has obtained University approval to\u000d\u000a        sub-license the technology for Ophthalmology\/optometry to OTI in return\u000d\u000a        for prosecution of the patent in three territories, USA, Europe and\u000d\u000a        Japan. The patent was filed in 2004 and only awarded in 2011. This\u000d\u000a        technology has not yet been exploited commercially by OPKO\/Optos.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Twenty-two PhD students have been trained within the OCT research\u000d\u000a      programme. All 22 have found employment commensurate with their\u000d\u000a      qualification level. e.g. M. Hathaway and J. Rogers, as Directors of OCT\u000d\u000a      research at OPKO (now Optos plc). G. Dobre was a PDRA supported by EPSRC\u000d\u000a      and NYEEI grants, becoming a lecturer in the AOG in 2003. D. Woods is now\u000d\u000a      employed by Michelson Diagnostics Ltd, which commercialises OCT\u000d\u000a      instrumentation for skin imaging.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Applied Optics Group (AOG) at Kent has been at the forefront\u000d\u000a      of fundamental research into optical coherence tomography (OCT)\u000d\u000a      for eye-imaging since 1996. The group has invented and developed\u000d\u000a      diagnostic OCT with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (OCT\/SLO). The combination\u000d\u000a      of these two techniques at Kent was crucial to the development of a new\u000a        generation of instrumentation, which was commercialised in 2006 and\u000d\u000a      now routinely used in eye clinics worldwide. It is essential technology in\u000d\u000a      the rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases that would\u000d\u000a      otherwise not be possible.\u000d\u000a    The new instrumentation provides rapid images at higher resolution that\u000d\u000a      are much less sensitive to patient movement. The direct impact is on the\u000d\u000a        doctors who have access to more information on the patients\u000d\u000a      condition in much less time, as well as patients whose rapid\u000d\u000a      diagnosis increases their treatment success rate. We estimate that\u000d\u000a        around five million patients worldwide have benefitted from this\u000d\u000a        technology. There is indirect impact via the profits to the\u000d\u000a      University and to the company that holds the licence to manufacture the\u000d\u000a      instruments.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Kent\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2964180","Name":"Galway"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    The first three references (1, 2, and 3; marked with a *) best indicate\u000d\u000a      the quality of the underpinning research, averaging 91 citations per\u000d\u000a      paper.\u000d\u000a    \u000a1*.

The EPSRC funded research enabled the development of methods to\u000d\u000a      rapidly obtain three dimensional OCT images of the retina and skin. The\u000d\u000a      new technology facilitated the next generation of high resolution images\u000d\u000a      at previously unachievable en-face orientations (a direct frontal view),\u000d\u000a      similar to those obtained through microscopy [1]. This pioneering approach\u000d\u000a      and insight permitted immediate integration of OCT technology with\u000d\u000a      confocal microscopy [2]. This led to the development of a new dual\u000d\u000a        channel instrument OCT\/SLO, which was exclusively licensed to\u000d\u000a        Ophthalmic Technology Inc (OTI), Canada. Between 2001 and 2010, the\u000d\u000a      Applied Optics group at Kent has facilitated the transition\u000d\u000a      of en-face OCT, and of the OCT\/SLO technology, from the experimental\u000d\u000a        setup at the University of Kent to practicing eye clinics. Numerous\u000d\u000a      supporting grants for Podoleanu as PI, exceeding &#163;200K, have been provided\u000d\u000a      by OTI, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary (NYEEI), and the Ariba Foundation\u000d\u000a      to support this work via staffing, equipment and teaching replacement, as\u000d\u000a      well as carrying out testing and trials. The OCT\/SLO technology was\u000d\u000a      initially tested on patients at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary (NYEEI),\u000d\u000a      the Macula Foundation, NY, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam and\u000d\u000a      Yokashiwava College, Japan with support from OTI. From its early days, the\u000d\u000a      en-face OCT proved vital for early diagnosis of melanocytoma,\u000d\u000a      diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascular membrane, and macular pucker\u000d\u000a      [2]. As a result of this international collaboration and support, a demand\u000d\u000a      for further development was identified, and a new three channel\u000d\u000a        instrument, with a third fluorescence channel, was invented at\u000d\u000a        Kent and tested on patients [6]. The OCT\/SLO technology contributed\u000d\u000a      to a rapid advance in diagnosis of age related macula degeneration,\u000d\u000a      diabetes and other diseases of the eye became possible [5].\u000d\u000a    Further support to Podoleanu (PI) from EPSRC for \"Adaptive Optics\u000d\u000a      Assisted Optical Coherence Tomography for Retinal Imaging\", 2003-2006,\u000d\u000a      (value &#163;180K) led to publication [3].

Established research has\u000a      documented substantial weaknesses in this approach [Tanaka and\u000a      Farah J. Experimental Psychology 46A 225 (1993)]. In particular, facial\u000a      recognition by humans does not function through decomposition into\u000a      distinct features, but through a gestalt or holistic impression. Moreover,\u000a      the inability of humans to recall and describe faces accurately compared\u000a      to their superior ability to recognise faces is well established. Thus\u000a      approaches emphasising the need for recall and description do not match\u000a      human cognitive processes, and are inherently disadvantaged. Studies\u000a      conducted prior to the introduction of EFIT-V suggested that the\u000a      operational identification rate of police forces using\u000a      feature-based systems worldwide was only 5%. [McQuiston-Surrett\u000a      et.al Psychology, Crime and Law 12 505 (2006)].\u000a    Research within SPS underpinning EFIT-V commenced in 1997 and\u000a      continues to this day. Initial published work demonstrated the utility of\u000a      a set of matched 2D polynomials to estimate optically\u000a        distorted wavefronts, and to represent and automatically classify\u000a      impact craters efficiently (see references to research section). A key\u000a      insight was that quasi-stochastic processes (impact craters being one\u000a      example) are numerous and the extension of these methods to the stochastic\u000a      pattern class of human faces yielded an extremely efficient parametric\u000a      representation. Calculation of a Karhunen-Loeve basis set enabled a\u000a      recognisable, near photographic quality facial image to be stored in just\u000a      50 bytes. Based on this, Dr. Solomon (SPS since 1994, Lecturer now\u000a      Reader) led the development of both a prototype system for encoding the\u000a      owner's face on a credit card's magnetic strip (reported in New Scientist\u000a      Aug 29th 1998 and on Tomorrow's World, 1998) and FaceMail (winner of the\u000a      UK and European stages of the EU-sponsored DICON (digital information\u000a      contents) 2000 competition) (see section 5 for link to further details).\u000a      FaceMail worked by attaching an encoded picture of the sender to the\u000a      email-header providing a visual impression of the sender to aid\u000a      prioritisation and handling of spam messages.\u000a    In 2001, Solomon led a research team to begin exploring methods of\u000a      computerised facial synthesis that combined calculated sets of\u000a      Karhunen-Loeve functions for the shape and texture of the face with an\u000a      interactive search algorithm that enabled witnesses to converge on the\u000a      required identity by manipulating the underlying Karhunen-Loeve\u000a      coefficients. Dr Gibson (SPS since 1994, UG, PhD, Postdoc and Lecturer)\u000a      developed suitable statistical models across all varieties of human facial\u000a      appearance. Research students made significant contributions, including\u000a      A.Pallares-Bejarano (Kent PhD 2002-2006) who developed the most efficient\u000a      stochastic\/evolutionary search algorithm, M.Maylin (Kent PhD 2002-2006,\u000a      PDRA 2006-2009) resolved issues of software implementation, computational\u000a      efficiency and speed, and C.Scandrett (Kent PhD 2003-2007) who made\u000a      significant contributions to automated age progression, which was\u000a      ultimately employed in the commercial software.\u000a    Four successive EPSRC grants (Solomon, PI, 1-4 in Section 3) were secured\u000a      to develop the underlying science and extend these ideas commercially. All\u000a      four were rated Outstanding for potential benefits to society. Commercial\u000a      potential was recognised early and two UK patents were lodged in 2005. The\u000a      basic elements of the developed experimental system were published in 2003\u000a      (reference 2). Two key advancements that were subsequently implemented in\u000a      the commercial EFIT-V system were automated caricaturing [Gibson\u000a      et al, Behaviour Reseach 37 170 (2005)] and automated age\u000a      progression [Scandrett et.al Pattern Recogniton Letters, 27 1776\u000a      (2006)].\u000a    A comprehensive account of the underpinning science has recently been\u000a      published. [Solomon et al Applied Soft Computing 13 3298 (2012)].\u000a      Key insights underpinning the impact of EFIT-V were:\u000a    \u000a      Statistical techniques researched by the Kent group for treating\u000a        stochastic processes (e.g. impact craters and atmospherically distorted\u000a        wavefronts) could be extended to human faces with unparalleled\u000a        efficiency.\u000a      The resulting compact representation provided a mathematical model of\u000a        facial appearance that was better matched to human face recognition and\u000a        cognitive processes than the crude feature based model employed in\u000a        earlier commercial systems.\u000a      The model allowed eyewitnesses new, flexible ways to alter facial\u000a        appearance (e.g. fully automatic age progression) and alteration of\u000a        subjective attributes (e.g. weight loss\/gain, hostility, health).\u000a      A viable stochastic search algorithm could be defined enabling the\u000a        underlying model to be manipulated easily by human observers without\u000a        technical or specialist knowledge to achieve satisfactory likenesses.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2325","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    All modern semiconductor devices depend on highly reproducible,\u000d\u000a      nanometre-scale multilayer engineering for dielectrics, semiconductor\u000d\u000a      doping and heterostructures.

This unique ion beam system has held its place as the state\u000d\u000a      of the art in shallow depth profiling from the day of its first\u000d\u000a      application in the Department of Physics at Warwick right up until the\u000d\u000a      present. Nothing else matches its depth resolution (measured in Angstroms)\u000d\u000a      and etch rates. The FLIG gave the semiconductor companies the ability to\u000d\u000a      develop new generations of devices with ever increasing miniaturisation.\u000d\u000a      So, the FLIG was an essential technology in the development of all modern\u000d\u000a      electronics...\" [10].\u000d\u000a    Through mounting FLIG systems onto instruments by Atomika, and more\u000d\u000a      recently Cameca ISA, further sales worth tens of millions of pounds have\u000d\u000a      been generated and it remains an integral part of the Atomika (Cameca)\u000d\u000a      range of SIMS instrumentation [13]. Ionoptika continues to supply the FLIG\u000d\u000a      amongst other instrumentation that includes state-of-the-art\u000d\u000a      time-of-flight-SIMS. Substantial royalties have also been paid to the\u000d\u000a      University of Warwick, the inventor, and the Paul Instrument Fund (who\u000d\u000a      recovered their initial investment).\u000d\u000a    The impact of FLIG-based tools has been continuous since 1996 and\u000d\u000a      continues to grow alongside the expansion of microelectronic technology\u000d\u000a      into every area of modern life. They are in routine use today as process\u000d\u000a      control tools for the most demanding silicon industry, such as Intel,\u000d\u000a      where they have contributed to the development of PentiumTM,\u000d\u000a      XeonTM and CoreTM i7 (2008-date) processors:\u000d\u000a      \"The development of the floating low energy ion gun (FLIG) by Professor\u000d\u000a      Mark Dowsett and his colleagues at the University of Warwick in the early\u000d\u000a      1990's was one of the most significant developments in analytical\u000d\u000a      instrumentation in the last 20 years. The refinement of the design and the\u000d\u000a      subsequent implementation on commercial SIMS instrumentation enabled\u000d\u000a      reliable, fast and accurate SIMS depth profiling of thin layers and\u000d\u000a      ultra-shallow junctions. This capability was critically important to the\u000d\u000a      semiconductor industry that was in an era of continuous junction scaling.\u000d\u000a      Intel was an early adopter of the FLIG technology in the mid 90's and the\u000d\u000a      FLIG remains a key capability in our laboratory today.\" [14]\u000d\u000a    FLIG-based tools are routinely employed in research on established\u000d\u000a      electronic materials and new semiconductors, such as diamond, carbides and\u000d\u000a      nitrides [15]. The high resolution depth profiling enabled by FLIG-based\u000d\u000a      tools is invaluable in developing a wide range of generic semiconductor\u000d\u000a      devices and other technologies, such as dynamic random access memory\u000d\u000a      (DRAMs) central to all computer data storage, quantum wells e.g. for GaN\u000d\u000a      light emitting diodes (LEDs), silicon germanium alloys, and high and low-k\u000d\u000a      dielectrics.

This continues to be state-of-the-art for the\u000d\u000a      semiconductor sector.\" [16]\u000d\u000a    To date, there are over 1,000 Google hits on FLIG associated items.\u000d\u000a      Dowsett's name for the ion gun and its acronym FLIG, although trademarked\u000d\u000a      by Ionoptika (US\u000a        Trademark No. 75047263), have become generically synonymous with\u000d\u000a      this type of technology. There are at least 100 peer reviewed papers, from\u000d\u000a      a wide range of international academic and commercial bodies, that\u000d\u000a      acknowledge use of the FLIG or Atomika \/ Cameca 4500, 4550 and 4600\u000d\u000a      instruments and hundreds of presentations at semiconductor workshops [e.g.\u000d\u000a      17], which are the principal means of dissemination in the industry. Use\u000d\u000a      of the FLIG has spread well beyond its original technological drivers of\u000d\u000a      silicon, silicon germanium [17] and gallium arsenide, into nanotechnology,\u000d\u000a      diamond electronics, and cultural heritage [18].\u000d\u000a    Finally, the SIMS response function developed, in 1994, by Dowsett to\u000d\u000a      relate the data obtained from a SIMS instrument to the underlying material\u000d\u000a      profile has given rise to a current ISO standard (ISO\u000d\u000a        20341:2003) [19]. The function itself is thus also a significant\u000d\u000a      outcome of the original FLIG development. It is becoming known in the\u000d\u000a      field as the `Dowsett Function' [20] and has become important both for the\u000d\u000a      semiconductor depth profiling community and outside of the original\u000d\u000a      research field in the new science arising from depth profiling of organic\u000d\u000a      materials [21].\u000d\u000a      \"... the Dowsett function could be used to characterise the sputtering\u000d\u000a      process in these very different materials ...

The\u000d\u000a      underlying science behind the FLIG concept has two major drivers:\u000d\u000a    (i) In the late 1980s, the depth resolution provided by secondary ion\u000d\u000a      mass spectrometry (SIMS) in profiling devices was falling short of that\u000d\u000a      demanded by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. SIMS\u000d\u000a      instruments were using a high energy (several keV) primary ion beam, both\u000d\u000a      to laterally focus the bombarding ions and to achieve a measureable yield\u000d\u000a      of secondary ions ejected from the device under test; however, this high\u000d\u000a      energy limited vertical resolution. In defiance of the literature of the\u000d\u000a      time, and based on extrapolation of his own laboratory results at energies\u000d\u000a      down to below 1 keV, Dowsett was convinced that lowering the SIMS beam\u000d\u000a      energy still further, to a few hundred eV would improve the depth\u000d\u000a      resolution of SIMS.\u000d\u000a    (ii) In order to do this in a way that could be developed into a routine\u000d\u000a      analytical technique, it was necessary to greatly improve ion transport in\u000d\u000a      focussed ion beam columns, from the source outwards and to reduce\u000d\u000a      chromatic and spherical aberrations within the ion column to maximize the\u000d\u000a      usefulness of the transported current. At that time a few pA on target\u000d\u000a      into a spot size of 50 &#181;m was typical for a beam energy of 1 keV.\u000d\u000a    No real progress on reducing beam energy was made until, in 1995, Dowsett\u000d\u000a      demonstrated dramatic improvements of the ion optics in a sub-keV ion\u000d\u000a      column [2] which he created with initial support from the Royal Society's\u000d\u000a      Paul Instrument Fund [8]. The success of the prototype depended on the\u000d\u000a      superb electronics and mechanical engineering support in the Warwick Dept.\u000d\u000a      of Physics, reflected by co-authorship of several technical staff on the\u000d\u000a      early papers. Subsequently, precise details of the instrumentation could\u000d\u000a      no longer be published as they became and remain commercially\u000d\u000a      confidential.\u000d\u000a    A central part of the FLIG concept is that most of the ion column is\u000d\u000a      `floating' at a high negative potential, so that ions are transported and\u000d\u000a      conditioned at high velocities, but then slowed down to impact energies of\u000d\u000a      100's or even 10's of eV just before striking the sample. This was the key\u000d\u000a      to improving the space-charge transport, generating useful impacting\u000d\u000a      fluxes up to 50,000 times higher than would otherwise have been possible,\u000d\u000a      and improving vertical resolution because the impact velocity at the\u000d\u000a      sample is so much less. Consequently, higher-resolution data can now be\u000d\u000a      obtained in minutes or hours, rather than in impractical time periods of\u000d\u000a      months or years.\u000d\u000a    The research output comprises: (i) conference papers, related patents [9]\u000d\u000a      and PhD theses deriving directly from the original research; (ii) key\u000d\u000a      papers that establish Dowsett's contribution to the applications research,\u000d\u000a      for example, developing the concept of the SIMS response function [3, 4]\u000d\u000a      that led to an ISO standard for depth resolution (Section 4); (iii)\u000d\u000a      numerous contributions [e.g. 5,6], to the subsequent development of\u000d\u000a      ultra-low-energy (ule) SIMS as a quantitative technique that is now being\u000d\u000a      used extensively in the semiconductor industry; and (iv) papers and\u000d\u000a      advances in materials processing and device technology made by other\u000d\u000a      owners of the instrumentation.\u000d\u000a    Maximum initial impact of this research was notably achieved by\u000d\u000a      presenting the early results at the SIMS X conference in M&#252;nster\u000d\u000a      (October 1995) where both instrument manufacturers and users were present\u000d\u000a      [2]. Within a few minutes of the presentation describing the device, the\u000d\u000a      three principal SIMS manufacturers of the time all tried to close deals to\u000d\u000a      use the technology. Atomika were the successful bidders, and made an\u000d\u000a      exclusive OEM deal with Ionoptika Ltd., a UK SME based near Southampton to\u000d\u000a      whom the University of Warwick had licensed the FLIG. The Atomika (now\u000d\u000a      Cameca) 4500, 4550 and 4600 instruments were the outcome of that initial\u000d\u000a      intellectual property (IP) licensing agreement.\u000d\u000a    Dowsett has continued to develop the technology. The commercial version\u000d\u000a      of the FLIG, which can now deliver around 500 nA of usable beam current at\u000d\u000a      500 eV, has re-engineered optics and its own custom high brightness\u000d\u000a      duoplasmatron with a low energy spread (both designed by Dowsett, in 1995\u000d\u000a      and 2004, respectively, the latter being descended from an earlier design\u000d\u000a      by Drummond &amp; Long.) The success of the commercial FLIG depended on\u000d\u000a      the development of this very high brightness, cold cathode duoplasmatron,\u000d\u000a      which delivers both oxygen and other gas species such as inert gases and\u000d\u000a      nitrogen (that normally require a hot cathode source). Further elements of\u000d\u000a      the innovative design include a matched column that transports the beam at\u000d\u000a      high energy to the vicinity of the sample, and a multi-element, low\u000d\u000a      aberration retarding lens to reduce the impact energy by a factor of 10 to\u000d\u000a      30. Dowsett also designed the secondary ion optical and detector systems\u000d\u000a      of the Atomika 4550 and the 4600, and continues to provide support and\u000d\u000a      expertise to Ionoptika and users of the technology as a consultant.\u000d\u000a      Warwick has recently signed a further licence agreement with Ionoptika,\u000d\u000a      covering new FLIG-related ion source technology developed by Dowsett and\u000d\u000a      his son David, who completed his PhD at the University of Warwick in 2007\u000d\u000a      [7].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2326","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above, and in particular development of virtual\u000a      substrates and Ge epitaxy, led to the launch of a spin-out company in\u000a      2003. Starting with &#163;2 M of venture capital funding and six employees, AdvanceSis\u000a      aimed to commercialise outputs from Warwick's NanoSilicon Group patent\u000a      portfolio [7]. AdvanceSis was initially nurtured within the Dept\u000a      of Physics, with a minimum of bureaucracy and full access to facilities.\u000a      This enabled the company rapidly to develop both the epitaxial know-how\u000a      and business acumen required for expansion [10]. In 2005, AdvanceSis\u000a      won the Lord Stafford Award for `Best University Spin Out'. A significant\u000a      aspect of the business was to supply Ge-on-Si wafers into the R&amp;D\u000a      programme of a major semiconductor company that led (in 2009) to a\u000a      prototype short-range optical link using Ge detectors. AdvanceSis\u000a      were complimented on producing much higher quality wafers than other\u000a      sub-contractors and delivering to schedule.\u000a    AdvanceSis moved to its own premises on the University of Warwick\u000a      Science Park in 2008 and identified a market niche in solar-power\u000a      generation by concentrator photo-voltaic (CPV) tech- nology, initially\u000a      using Ge solar cells. To reflect this, in 2009 the company changed its\u000a      name to Circadian Solar [11]. By improving the efficiency of both\u000a      the solar cell material, advanced optics and sun-tracking control systems\u000a      accurate to 0.4&#186;, Circadian Solar made 30 m2 systems of\u000a      CPV modules that were more than twice as efficient as typical commercial\u000a      Si panels and could produce solar electricity at close to the critical\u000a      $1\/W fully installed cost in regions with high levels of sun- shine [12].\u000a      As chairman of the board, Prof. Parker assisted the company, between 2003\u000a      and 2010, in raising a further &#163;12 M from Seven Spires Investments Ltd.,\u000a      who saw\u000a    \"excellent management, defensible Intellectual Property, a well\u000a      characterised route to market and global scalability to an expected market\u000a      capitalisation in excess of $100 M.\" [13]\u000a    In 2010, Circadian Solar was ranked 16th on a list of\u000a      top university spin-out companies [14] and, by the end of 2011, was\u000a      established as a fully independent company employing 35 people and with a\u000a      'net worth' of &#163;3.5 M [15].\u000a    Employees include a number of researchers trained to PhD level in the\u000a      NanoSilicon Group (Parsons, Nash, Fulgoni, Palmer, Capewell) and also\u000a      ex-motor industry workers from the West Midlands. Coventry South MP spoke\u000a      of the importance of the company whilst visiting in 2009:\u000a    \"The Midlands used to be the home of the automotive industry so this\u000a      region has been one of the hardest hit by job losses resulting from the\u000a      recession. Now we need to look to new industries such as solar power to\u000a      revitalise the region and help move us towards a low carbon economy. We\u000a      have the facilities, design expertise and skilled workforce in place to\u000a      capitalise on any investment made into this fledgling industry that has\u000a      such great potential.\" [16]\u000a    The growth of the company has generated business and employment for\u000a      sub-contractors not only in the UK but also abroad. In 2009, tf2\u000a        devices B.V. was created as a joint venture with Radboud University,\u000a      Nijmegen, [17] to exploit the epitaxial lift-off process for III-V\u000a      semiconductors used to make Circadian's CPV modules. As part of the\u000a      company's plan to demonstrate cost-effective energy yield in different\u000a      regions and environments module evaluation was performed in Cyprus in late\u000a      2008, and in 2010 Circadian established a test facility for its CPV solar\u000a      energy system in Lisbon to take advantage of the high level of direct\u000a      sunlight in Portugal [12].\u000a    With the solar cell market in 2013 being dominated by Chinese state\u000a      subsidised large-area, low- efficiency silicon panels (having a fully\u000a      installed cost of well under $1\/W), many solar companies across the\u000a      Western world have collapsed. By contrast, Circadian Solar\u000a      survived (albeit with a reduced valuation in July 2013 of &#163;1.5 M). The\u000a      major impact in the REF Impact period has thus been to directly generate\u000a      employment and through the spending of over &#163;10 M in the economy including\u000a      sourcing components from sub-contractors.\u000a    Impact has also been achieved through:\u000a    (i) Collaborating with Industry on Research &#8212; Many European\u000a      companies started work in the SiGe field during the 1990's; the Warwick\u000a      group collaborated and published with Daimler-Chrysler, Philips, Siemens\u000a      (Infineon, Quimoda), ST Microelectronics among others. In the REF period,\u000a      we have supplied several industrial collaborators with extremely high\u000a      quality epitaxial material. For example, in 2008-10, Warwick supplied 120\u000a      epitaxial wafers of Ge layers on Si substrates to IMEC, where the\u000a      transistors were fabricated in a silicon industry compatible 65 nm process\u000a      by Intel employees to create the first strained-Ge transistors [18]. In\u000a      2009, over 100 wafers were supplied to MPI Halle for developing a layer\u000a      transfer process to create Ge-on-insulator platforms. We have also applied\u000a      our expertise and characterisation facilities to analyse devices made by\u000a      companies. In a joint activity with device modellers from University of\u000a      Udine, NXP Semiconductors (now part of TSMC) benefitted from a greater\u000a      understanding of their FinFET devices [19]:\u000a    \"Key to building this understanding is the development and experimental\u000a      verification of charge transport models. The characterisation ...\u000a      performed by the Warwick team has led to new insights and supported\u000a      greatly the development of predictive transport models that can be\u000a      incorporated into device simulation tools. In this way the expertise and\u000a      capabilities of the Warwick team have impacted both the development costs\u000a      and development time of novel finFET-based CMOS technologies.\" [20]\u000a    TSMC is now entering production with 20 nm node FinFETs [21], and these\u000a      could well become 20% of their $14 B annual revenue within the next 10\u000a      years.\u000a    (ii) Industrially Relevant Training &#8212; PhD students and PDRAs in\u000a      the Group have not only developed expertise in using advanced equipment\u000a      for fabrication and characterisation of semi- conductor devices, but have\u000a      also engaged with our collaborative partners (mentioned in (i) above).\u000a      This has included making use of exchange programmes with companies through\u000a      the SiNANO networks [9, 22] that Parker and Leadley played a pivotal role\u000a      in setting up. 15 PhD graduates and PDRAs from the NanoSilicon Group (list\u000a      available on request) have gone on to use their specific expertise working\u000a      for a number of companies and research institutes incl. AmberWave, IMEC,\u000a      International Rectifier, IQE, NXP, Philips, QinetiQ, Sharp, VG Semicon,\u000a      and Circadian Solar.

In essence, strain\u000a      distorts the Si crystal lattice, allowing electrons within it to travel\u000a      faster. This improves microprocessor speed and has been employed by Intel\u000a      since the 90 nm technology node in 2000, through the current 22 nm\u000a      production node, to all planned future transistors. The crucial required\u000a      understanding of the effects of strain arose from research on SiGe epitaxy\u000a      (the controlled deposition of material in sequential atomic layers), in\u000a      which the Warwick NanoSilicon research group has played a significant\u000a      part. The group was established in 1986 by Prof. Evan Parker and has\u000a      published over 200 journal papers related to silicon-based epitaxy since\u000a      1993 [e.g. 1-3]. From 1997 to 2003, the Warwick Group led the EPSRC \"SiGe\u000a      for MOS Technologies\" programme [8], with leading European industrial\u000a      partners, that both created a UK community in the research field and was\u000a      instrumental in establishing germanium as an essential component for\u000a      developing new technologies.\u000a    Germanium has a much larger hole mobility than Si, which is attractive\u000a      for the p-channel in CMOS; Ge also has a smaller bandgap than silicon,\u000a      which gives it advantages as a light absorber within a solar cell or as\u000a      photon detector. However, the natural spacing between Ge atoms is 4%\u000a      larger than for Si which makes growing Ge directly on the ubiquitous Si\u000a      substrate a challenge; strain relaxation during epitaxial growth can lead\u000a      to a very high density of dislocations that is detrimental to device\u000a      performance. So another inventive step was required: during 2000-2004 the\u000a      Warwick Group embarked on research to create smooth strain-tuning buffers\u000a      (`virtual substrates' VS that enable a transition from the Si substrate to\u000a      an arbitrary SiGe alloy, with the surface layer being fully relaxed). The\u000a      threading defect density was reduced from above 1010cm-2\u000a      to below 106cm-2 (an acceptable level for device\u000a      processing) whilst maintaining a surface roughness below a few nanometres\u000a      for a Si0.5Ge0.5 alloy [4] and ~1 nm for a 20% Ge\u000a      alloy. Silicon layers grown on top of these platforms would be biaxially\u000a      compressive strained, whilst Ge layers would be tensile strained. The\u000a      novelty of the Warwick approach came in the method of increasing the Si1-xGex\u000a      alloy composition through the virtual substrate (from x=0 at the Si\u000a      substrate) and in the initial surface preparation. This research in novel\u000a      types of epitaxial growth led to a portfolio of patents [7], which in turn\u000a      led to the creation of the spin-out company AdvanceSis for their\u000a      exploitation.\u000a    In a parallel development by the NanoSilicon group working with AdvanceSis,\u000a      fully relaxed Ge layers were produced directly on Si through a two-step\u000a      growth procedure: a thin initial `seed layer' of Ge is deposited at a low\u000a      growth temperature, which accommodates the change in lattice para- meter\u000a      by forming a dense network of dislocations; a second thicker layer of Ge\u000a      is grown at much higher temperature that encourages dislocation glide and\u000a      annihilation, resulting in a smooth relaxed Ge surface. Such material was\u000a      shown to be suitable for solar photovoltaic and infrared detector\u000a      applications [5]. These platforms also provided a route to integrating Ge\u000a      and III-V semi- conductor heterostructures (such as used for LEDs and\u000a      laser diodes) onto silicon, which opens the possibility of combining the\u000a      processing power of silicon electronics with the added optical\u000a      functionality of the other materials.\u000a    Finally, these two developments were combined to create `reverse graded\u000a      virtual substrates' that start from a relaxed Ge layer grown by the\u000a      two-temperature method and then decrease the Ge fraction from x=1 in a\u000a      series of Si1-xGex alloy layers [6]. With such\u000a      structures the substrate required to support a strained Ge layer can be\u000a      much thinner, and of better quality, than with conventional forward\u000a      grading. Indeed, we have produced a two-dimensional hole gas with a\u000a      low-temperature mobility of over 1.5x106cm2\/Vs in\u000a      such a strained Ge heterostructure.\u000a    A vital factor in enabling impact, was the major investment by Warwick in\u000a      an industrially compatible epitaxy system (2003). The ASM Epsilon 2000E\u000a      reduced pressure chemical vapour deposition tool enabled us to produce\u000a      wafers meeting the exacting standards of industry, in sufficient quantity.\u000a    Principal Warwick Researchers: Prof. Evan Parker (1986-2013),\u000a      Prof. Terry Whall (1987-2013), Prof. David Leadley (1995-2013); Rob Lander\u000a      (PhD 1993-97, RA 97-98), Tim Grasby (PhD 1996- 00, RA 00-03), Maksym\u000a      Myronov (PhD 1997-2001, SRF 08-13), Martin Palmer (PhD 1997-01), Adam\u000a      Capewell (PhD 1998-02, RA 02-03), Dominic Fulgoni (PhD 1998-02, RA 02-03),\u000a      Lee Nash (PhD 2001-05), John Parsons (PhD 2004-07), Andrew Dobbie (PhD\u000a      2003-07, RA 07-11), Vishal Shah (PhD 2005-09, RA 09-13), Stephen Thomas\u000a      (PhD 2006-10).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2327","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Industry benefits from the Group's research work addressing key questions\u000d\u000a      on the viability of new non-destructive testing (NDT) methodology, and\u000d\u000a      developing equipment for their adoption.\u000d\u000a    The spin-out company Sonemat has operated continuously throughout the REF\u000d\u000a      impact period.

In 2007, the Group\u000d\u000a      began a collaboration with Cummins Turbo Technologies, a global power\u000d\u000a      leader (with sales over $1 bn p.a.), on the eddy current inspection of\u000d\u000a      turbocharger components. This has benefited Cummins by incorporating the\u000d\u000a      improved techniques for sub-surface flaw detection in their casting\u000d\u000a      foundry, as suggested by the research work and introducing batch\u000d\u000a      modifications and processes that reduce scrap materials and field failures\u000d\u000a      and thereby provide long-term cost savings. A former Warwick EngD student,\u000d\u000a      now Senior Materials Engineer [18] leads the development of new inspection\u000d\u000a      techniques at Cummins and states:\u000d\u000a      \"The research provided Cummins with a detection method for the\u000d\u000a      identification of critical surface and sub-surface casting defects,\u000d\u000a      through the novel use of eddy current technology, which has previously not\u000d\u000a      been possible. The availability of this detection tool has enabled us to\u000d\u000a      quantify the quality of our supplier castings with a greater resolution\u000d\u000a      and as a result has driven multiple casting improvement initiatives which\u000d\u000a      aim to improve the turbocharger durability, improving our reputation for\u000d\u000a      reliability and reducing warranty costs. Multiple other benefits stemmed\u000d\u000a      from the research, reaching beyond the objectives of the original project,\u000d\u000a      including a greater understanding of how the casting defects are\u000d\u000a      distributed within a casting and ... when and how life-limiting defects\u000d\u000a      can be introduced into the casting process.\"\u000d\u000a    Other companies to benefit from this eddy current testing research\u000d\u000a      include Rolls Royce and RWE npower. Rolls Royce are starting to implement\u000d\u000a      eddy current array scanning technology, on the basis of a firm\u000d\u000a      understanding of its strengths and limitations; this will provide\u000d\u000a      significant cost savings and improved reliability [19].

Much of their research\u000d\u000a      has been undertaken through the EPSRC-funded Research Centre for\u000d\u000a        Non-Destructive Evaluation (RCNDE - www.rcnde.ac.uk)\u000d\u000a      [8], a collaboration between sixteen major industrial partners and six UK\u000d\u000a      universities. The RCNDE develops research projects that are targeted\u000d\u000a      towards medium to long-term industrial needs. Dixon is the Academic\u000d\u000a      Chairman and a Board Member of the RCNDE. There are a further twenty or so\u000d\u000a      associated members who are mainly SMEs or micro-companies. The Ultrasonics\u000d\u000a      Group has separately collaborated with a number of other multinational and\u000d\u000a      international companies such as Corus, Alcan and Network Rail [9,10].\u000d\u000a    Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) Since 1993, the\u000d\u000a      Group's research has led to key discoveries in EMATs [1-6], particularly\u000d\u000a      in broadband EMATs that make it possible to generate and detect a range of\u000d\u000a      ultrasonic frequencies simultaneously [1,2]. The major progress in EMAT\u000d\u000a      design achieved in Warwick has arisen from a thorough understanding of the\u000d\u000a      underlying physics, both of the real EMAT device and of the material being\u000d\u000a      tested in a real world application [2,3]; by meticulous design and\u000d\u000a      building of both the transducers and associated electronics [4]; and\u000d\u000a      through developing modelling and simulation of ultrasonic propagation in\u000d\u000a      real materials. For instance, generic methods have been developed for\u000d\u000a      measuring the thickness of thin Al sheets [1]; measuring surface coating\u000d\u000a      thickness from bulk ultra-sound propagation [5]; assessing ferrous metals\u000d\u000a      using an EMAT coil without a permanent magnetic [4]; introducing a ferrite\u000d\u000a      backing to enhance eddy current generation and hence create a much larger\u000d\u000a      ultrasonic wave amplitude [6].\u000d\u000a    Many of the Group's research outputs proceed to either commercialisation\u000d\u000a      or licensing. There are other examples where the fundamental research\u000d\u000a      interests in material property measurement, such as research developing\u000d\u000a      dry acoustic couplants for ambient and high temperature applications [7],\u000d\u000a      or know-how developed on research projects on system integration and\u000d\u000a      signal processing, provide other industrial impact. In 2005, the Group\u000d\u000a      established the spin-out company Sonemat, with support from the Dept. of\u000d\u000a      Physics, as a vehicle both for the commercialisation of EMATs for NDT and\u000d\u000a      to allow wider engagement in industrial-academic collaborative programmes\u000d\u000a      than would be achievable by the academic group alone. The impact of\u000d\u000a      Sonemat is discussed in Section 4.\u000d\u000a    The Group's pre-eminence in the NDT field was recognised by the\u000d\u000a      establishment in March 2011 of a Research Chair (currently held by\u000d\u000a      Professor Dixon) [11] sponsored by Elster, one of the world's largest\u000d\u000a      electricity, gas and water measurement and control providers. Elster's\u000d\u000a      Vice-President (Technology -Electronic), has stated that choosing\u000d\u000a      Professor Dixon and the University of Warwick has enabled Elster `to\u000d\u000a      engage with one of Europe's leading researchers in the field and one of\u000d\u000a      the UK's leading university research hubs' [ tinyurl.com\/lbxlqc9\u000d\u000a      ].\u000d\u000a    Transducers for gas flow - Since the establishment of the Elster\u000d\u000a      Research Chair, the Group has been collaborating with the gas flow\u000d\u000a      measurement industry to support a number of developments. This\u000d\u000a      collaboration has already led to some major advances in industrial\u000d\u000a      prototype design (although bound by strict confidentiality at this stage).\u000d\u000a      The Group is now working with industry to improve the current ultrasonic\u000d\u000a      transduction methods and developing the next generation of transducers for\u000d\u000a      gas flow measurement. Much of this experimental research is underpinned by\u000d\u000a      finite element modelling, using the results from such models to inform and\u000d\u000a      optimise transducer design.\u000d\u000a    Warwick researchers: The Ultrasonics Group currently consists of\u000d\u000a      two academics Prof. S.M.

To date, 9 commercial licences have\u000d\u000a      been generated (shared between Liverpool and Warwick). We hold agreements\u000d\u000a      with the National Physics Laboratory (NPL) and American\u000d\u000a        Magnetics, and we have formed a close partnership with Huber\u000d\u000a        Diffraktionstechnik GmbH &amp; Co [7], who are world leaders in\u000d\u000a      supplying specialist x-ray equipment with an annual turnover of ca. &#8364;8 M.\u000d\u000a      In the REF period, sales of licensed XMaS instruments to customers in the\u000d\u000a      US, Europe, and the Far East have produced a turn-over of &#8364;750 k for Huber.\u000d\u000a      They write:\u000d\u000a      \"We have benefitted enormously through the XMaS collaboration through\u000d\u000a      which we have been able to add to our product range and ensure that we\u000d\u000a      stay at the forefront of the worldwide market in x-ray instrumentation.\u000d\u000a      This benefit is not just from the additional new Huber instruments that we\u000d\u000a      have developed in partnership with the XMaS team but also through the\u000d\u000a      increased market share this partnership brings to Huber.... With the XMaS\u000d\u000a      products, we were able to sell complete integrated systems... to meet the\u000d\u000a      future needs of our customers.\" [7]\u000d\u000a    An article in the EPSRC newsletter, Connect, describes the impact\u000d\u000a      of the XMaS instrumentation as `big business' highlighting that \"research\u000d\u000a      can have impact through innovative instrumentation as well as science\"\u000d\u000a      [8]. By adopting the XMaS-developed research infrastructure, SR facilities\u000d\u000a      world-wide can enhance their capabilities, extend their reach and run\u000d\u000a      experiments more efficiently.\u000d\u000a    \"If these XMaS designed slits were not available commercially we would\u000d\u000a      have had to develop them ourselves\" [9].\u000d\u000a    As an example, our XYZ-cryostat mount [10] enables the sample to be\u000d\u000a      repositioned remotely, aligning its position on a micron scale. At the US\u000d\u000a      Advanced Photon Source\u000d\u000a      \"use of the XYZ cryostat mounts saves ~1 day of beamtime per experiment\u000d\u000a      ... which equates to $9072\/day ... directly saving the APS facility $1.5 M\u000d\u000a      per annum\" [11].\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, eleven XYZ-cryostat mounts have been sold globally. Including\u000d\u000a      the 7 sold previously, and used throughout the REF impact period, we can\u000d\u000a      extrapolate a total annual saving of ~ $4 M to the sector.\u000d\u000a    Since the XMaS project has been running, several new central facilities\u000d\u000a      have been built or up-graded, including DIAMOND, APS and the LNLS in\u000d\u000a      Brazil. Through knowledge transfer and direct interaction of staff between\u000d\u000a      these facilities, we have enabled projects to be completed more\u000d\u000a      efficiently and cost effectively. This was typified by the deliberate\u000d\u000a      sequential appointment of a post-doctoral researcher (Gemma Newby) to work\u000d\u000a      on XMaS for two years before transferring to DIAMOND in 2009.\u000d\u000a    \"This saved us a year of development time [and] cost saving equivalent to\u000d\u000a      ~&#163;40 k \" [9].\u000d\u000a    Another example of exchange of processes is the installation of an\u000d\u000a      electric-field capability, developed by XMaS with NPL, at DIAMOND [12].\u000d\u000a      More recently, in 2013, the Swiss Light Source and the APS have\u000d\u000a      implemented our methods for controlling the incident polarisation, which\u000d\u000a      has\u000d\u000a      \"pioneered the use of thin etched silicon...the fast switching piezo\u000d\u000a      stage...rapid acquisition of high quality data\" [11].\u000d\u000a    Commercial organisations making use of our facilities include the (US)\u000d\u000a      National Standard Laboratories of NIST, the NPL, the Swiss national\u000d\u000a      laboratory EMPA, as well as St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Mary Rose Trust,\u000d\u000a      Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam and the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna.\u000d\u000a    XMaS has also developed sample environments that allow materials to be\u000d\u000a      studied under a range of atmospheric (gaseous or liquid) conditions. These\u000d\u000a      metrologies are well suited for cultural heritage and anthropological\u000d\u000a      studies where\u000d\u000a      \"XMaS is making a significant contribution to preservation of the heritage\u000d\u000a      of the EU...extending the lifetime and our understanding of beautiful\u000d\u000a      artworks and artefacts\" [13].\u000d\u000a    Two leading museums (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; Academy of Fine Arts,\u000d\u000a      Vienna) use the unique capabilities of XMaS to provide \"deeper insights\"\u000d\u000a      and develop new strategies to prevent atmospheric corrosion, and thus\u000d\u000a      preserve their collections for future generations [14]. Other examples,\u000d\u000a      which have also entered the public domain, include corrosion studies of\u000d\u000a      Tudor cannon balls from the wreck of the Mary Rose, highlighted in The\u000d\u000a        Sunday Telegraph and on-line [15]; as well as how teeth enamel can\u000d\u000a      be used to trace migratory patterns of early humans [16]. These types of\u000d\u000a      study:\u000d\u000a      \"ensure that the huge contribution heritage tourism makes to the GDP of EU\u000d\u000a      countries will continue\" [13].\u000d\u000a    As a major facility we communicate, disseminate and transfer knowledge\u000d\u000a      and ideas to a wide community which includes both industry and the public:\u000d\u000a      we circulate an annual newsletter world-wide, hold open user meetings, and\u000d\u000a      present at events such as the Technology World conference,\u000d\u000a      organised by the DTI and attended by over 1,000 global companies. In\u000d\u000a      conjunction with commercial partners such as NPL and DIAMOND, we co-host,\u000d\u000a      sponsor and run specialist meetings and workshops for both academic and\u000d\u000a      industrial researchers. One outcome of these metings was a new web\u000d\u000a      resource detailing metrology standards for electrical measurement hosted\u000d\u000a      by NPL [17]. As a result of this collaboration XMaS and NPL became\u000d\u000a      partners in a major EU project that brings together the premier EU\u000d\u000a      metrology labs with commercial partners such as IBM [12]. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      some 3,000 members of the public visit the ESRF annually (50% students,\u000d\u000a      50% general public or industrial visitors). The on-site XMaS staff conduct\u000d\u000a      tours and highlight the importance and relevance of science conducted in\u000d\u000a      this large-scale European facility.\u000d\u000a    The XMaS project is committed to train the next generation of material\u000d\u000a      scientists with specialist expertise in advanced synchrotron radiation\u000d\u000a      techniques. Since 2008, more than 50 post-doctoral researchers have been\u000d\u000a      trained. 23 have since drawn on their research in positions at central\u000d\u000a      facilities around the world, including 10 who have taken up roles at the\u000d\u000a      home of synchrotron science in the UK (DIAMOND). As noted by the Institute\u000d\u000a      of Science and Technology in Art director\u000d\u000a      \"only institutions such as XMaS enable young researchers to be trained in\u000d\u000a      synchrotron techniques by experienced scientists ... extend their own\u000d\u000a      scientific network..., and to be one brick in the wall of Europe's\u000d\u000a      scientific ability to compete with the US and Asia\" [14].\u000d\u000a    The diverse range of people trained on XMaS - undergraduate and\u000d\u000a      postgraduate students, post-doctoral researchers, international visitors -\u000d\u000a      have been able to transferred their knowledge and experience to their\u000d\u000a      current roles These span industry, other central facilities (as mentioned\u000d\u000a      above) and education in schools.

This, coupled with the recently discovered phenomena of x-ray\u000d\u000a      resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS), high-lighted a need for an x-ray\u000d\u000a      synchrotron beamline facility to investigate the magnetic structure and\u000d\u000a      associated phenomena in single crystals. To maximise its impact we\u000d\u000a      identified that the higher flux and overall beam characteristics of a\u000d\u000a      third generation synchrotron radiation (SR) source were required;\u000d\u000a      so the beamline was built at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility\u000d\u000a      (ESRF).\u000d\u000a    EPSRC funds [6] were awarded to Prof. M.J. Cooper (University of Warwick)\u000d\u000a      &amp; Prof. W.G. Stirling (University of Keele, and later Liverpool) to\u000d\u000a      design (1991-94), build and commission (1994-97) a flexible beamline that\u000d\u000a      exploited an operational energy window between 3 and 20 keV covering the\u000d\u000a      actinide resonances. The beamline was fully commissioned in 1997 and\u000d\u000a      consisted of a non-magnetic six circle diffractometer with a standard\u000d\u000a      suite of sample environments and detectors that were suitable to exploit\u000d\u000a      the high flux and beam polarisation needed to study magnetic materials.\u000d\u000a      The design of the optical components (mirrors and monochromator), as well\u000d\u000a      as any air-paths, was optimised for low energy XRMS operations to\u000d\u000a      facilitate studies on actinides [1]. The polarisation of the incident beam\u000d\u000a      is a critical parameter for the study of ferromagnetic materials, and it\u000d\u000a      was evaluated during the early build phase. These measurements showed that\u000d\u000a      the design and beamline characteristics were suitable for studies of a\u000d\u000a      wide range of magnetic materials [2]. On completion of the commissioning\u000d\u000a      period, EPSRC awarded further funds for operations which have been\u000d\u000a      concurrent from 1997 [6].\u000d\u000a    Due to the simple, robust and flexible design of the original beamline,\u000d\u000a      the user community expanded rapidly to include new scientific areas and\u000d\u000a      challenges beyond actinide magnetism. These experiments used the beamline\u000d\u000a      in different ways and highlighted areas that could be optimised and made\u000d\u000a      more efficient through better control of the sample position and slit\u000d\u000a      defined beam paths. Off-the shelf components could not be found to resolve\u000d\u000a      these issues and the team therefore researched and designed new\u000d\u000a      infrastructure. Examples include the development of \"tube slits\" for\u000d\u000a      reducing background noise and the XYZ cryostat mount for highly accurate\u000d\u000a      and efficient sample positioning [3] during \"beam-on\" conditions. New\u000d\u000a      sample environments such as magnetic fields (1 T electromagnet and 4 T\u000d\u000a      superconducting magnet), a wet chemical cell and the ability to apply\u000d\u000a      electric fields at low temperatures (1 K) were also designed to fit onto\u000d\u000a      the diffractometer. These developments were completing during Phase II of\u000d\u000a      the project (2002-2007).\u000d\u000a    Whilst the original beamline was designed for lower than usual energies\u000d\u000a      (3 keV instead of &gt;5 keV), Phase III (2007-12) investigated how to\u000d\u000a      further lower the operational energy to 2.3 keV. This would both enable\u000d\u000a      new magnetic materials to be studied and extend our reach to new user\u000d\u000a      communities working on soft\/biological and catalytic materials. This\u000d\u000a      involved changes to the instrument hardware, a redesign of the\u000d\u000a      monochromator, and designing new evacuated sample environments. For the\u000d\u000a      first time, attenuators compatible with UHV operation had to be developed\u000d\u000a      to overcome absorption problems [4]. New methods for controlling the\u000d\u000a      incoming polarisation of the beam, back compatible with previous\u000d\u000a      developments, were also developed [5].\u000d\u000a    Although originally envisaged as a probe of actinide magnetism, the\u000d\u000a      continual developments throughout the XMaS project now mean that it is a\u000d\u000a      facility for the study of a broad range of material science. This\u000d\u000a      collaborative project is on-going, having been refunded recently as a\u000d\u000a      Mid-Range Facility by EPSRC [6] to allow continuation of research on new\u000d\u000a      capabilities and projects.\u000d\u000a    Warwick Researchers associated with XMaS development:\u000d\u000a      Project Directors, Professor M Cooper (from 1991), Dr T Hase (from\u000d\u000a      2007);\u000d\u000a      Research Staff, Bowyer (1992-95), Laundy (1992-1995), Brown (1993-\u000d\u000a      ), Thompson (1993- ), Paul (1995-2005), Bouchenoire (2001- ), Newby\u000d\u000a      (2007-09), Bikondoa (2009- ).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2776","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    During the impact reporting period 2008-2013, all of our Astronomy and\u000d\u000a      Astrophysics staff have\u000d\u000a      given public lectures, talks and demonstrations at a variety of events,\u000d\u000a      both nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally (see evidence web page).\u000d\u000a    Professor Gibson enhanced his commitment to public outreach during the\u000d\u000a      REF period, including\u000d\u000a      his invitation to address the European community at AstroFest-2013, before\u000d\u000a      a standing room only\u000d\u000a      crowd of 1000 people.

As a Builder within the international RAVE Survey, he was\u000d\u000a      responsible for the field\u000d\u000a      and target selection since the project's initiation, resulting in nearly\u000d\u000a      50 papers since 2006 (see\u000d\u000a      outputs). RAVE's chemical and dynamical \"tagging\" of individual stars\u000d\u000a      complements the leadership\u000d\u000a      role Gibson has played in driving the fields of galactic chemical\u000d\u000a      evolution and cosmological\u000d\u000a      chemodynamical simulations. His recognition that energy feedback plays a\u000d\u000a      pivotal role in shaping\u000d\u000a      the \"chemical structure\" of galaxies, has led to entirely new insights\u000d\u000a      into the origins of the thick disc\u000d\u000a      and stellar halos of galaxies, and the distribution of metals throughout\u000d\u000a      the Universe and its galactic\u000d\u000a      constituents. As the author of GEtool (an industry-standard chemical\u000d\u000a      evolution software package -\u000d\u000a      MN 290, 471; PASA 20, 189; Science 303, 59) and the chemistry patches to\u000d\u000a      the cosmological\u000d\u000a      adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES (MNRAS 424, L11), Gibson has\u000d\u000a      positioned himself to be\u000d\u000a      heavily involved in the interpretation of ESA's Gaia mission data, and its\u000d\u000a      ground-based\u000d\u000a      complements. Active in outreach on the subject of \"chemical tagging\",\u000d\u000a      Gibson has reinforced that\u000d\u000a      international research reputation with the general public through his\u000d\u000a      series of lectures (see\u000d\u000a      evidence web page).\u000d\u000a    Professor Kurtz was awarded a Fellowship of the Japanese Society for the\u000d\u000a      Promotion of Science in\u000d\u000a      2008. His research was undertaken at UCLAN continuously, during the period\u000d\u000a      2001 to 2013, and\u000d\u000a      concerns fundamental observational and theoretical astrophysics in the\u000d\u000a      area of asteroseismology\u000d\u000a      and related astronomy. This has informed and underpinned in some detail\u000d\u000a      all of the &gt;150 public\u000d\u000a      lectures and outreach events which Prof Kurtz has presented on this\u000d\u000a      subject during the impact\u000d\u000a      reporting period. For instance, his \"Sounds of the Stars\" and \"The real\u000d\u000a      music of the spheres\"\u000d\u000a      lectures present asteroseismology in a very clear way to a public or\u000d\u000a      secondary school audience.\u000d\u000a      The research has included numerous discoveries with spectra obtained with\u000d\u000a      the ESO VLT, and\u000d\u000a      with ultra-high precision photometry from the NASA Kepler mission,\u000d\u000a      including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      a new technique for measuring radial velocities photometrically;\u000d\u000a      discovery of a class of eccentric binary stars with dynamic tidal\u000d\u000a        distortions;\u000d\u000a      discovery of strongly magnetic Ap stars;\u000d\u000a      discovery of a giant planet orbiting an extreme HB star;\u000d\u000a      extreme ground-based photometric precision with the Whole Earth\u000d\u000a        Telescope.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In parallel with his public lectures, Prof Kurtz has given over 30\u000d\u000a      invited plenary talks, reviews and\u000d\u000a      conference summaries at international scientific conferences in the last\u000d\u000a      10 years.\u000d\u000a    Professor Ward-Thompson joined UCLAN in July 2012. Since then he has\u000d\u000a      published a Science\u000d\u000a      paper (337, 69) on the formation mechanism of brown dwarfs, and &gt;20\u000d\u000a      other papers about his\u000d\u000a      work with the Herschel Space Telescope, and has given public talks and\u000d\u000a      written popular articles\u000d\u000a      about his research in 2012\/13. In 2013 he is also the President of the\u000d\u000a      Society for Popular\u000d\u000a      Astronomy (SPA), which has over 2000 members, and has given numerous talks\u000d\u000a      around the\u000d\u000a      country to Society meetings, including in Edinburgh, Belfast, Cambridge\u000d\u000a      &amp; London (all in 2013),\u000d\u000a      and to local astronomical societies in Lancashire. He has also written\u000d\u000a      popular articles for the\u000d\u000a      Society's in-house magazine, Popular Astronomy, on his most recent\u000d\u000a      research, which has a\u000d\u000a      readership of several thousand. He has previously appeared on the BBC Sky\u000d\u000a      at Night programme\u000d\u000a      on half a dozen occasions and is a well-known figure UK-wide in amateur\u000d\u000a      astronomical circles.\u000d\u000a    Professor Walsh leads the UCLAN Solar Physics Group, and has a long track\u000d\u000a      record of research\u000d\u000a      on the Sun and Solar Physics, which has translated into over 70 public\u000d\u000a      outreach talks and events\u000d\u000a      during the REF reporting period. His 2013 Nature paper, for example,\u000d\u000a      published the highest\u000d\u000a      resolution images ever taken of the Sun's outer atmosphere. The data were\u000d\u000a      taken by the Hi-C\u000d\u000a      camera on-board a NASA sounding rocket, launched from the White Sands\u000d\u000a      firing range in New\u000d\u000a      Mexico. This generated a huge amount of interest from the media, both\u000d\u000a      nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally. He appeared on numerous BBC News programmes, and the work\u000d\u000a      appeared on\u000d\u000a      very many on-line news outlets world-wide. The highly detailed structure\u000d\u000a      revealed in the images\u000d\u000a      showed a plethora of twisted filaments, indicative of a very complex\u000d\u000a      magnetic field. In addition, the\u000d\u000a      high time sampling of the data enabled the first ever movies to be made at\u000d\u000a      this resolution of clumps\u000d\u000a      of plasma flowing along the field lines. He has since begun to publish a\u000d\u000a      number of papers (e.g. ApJ\u000d\u000a      771, 21) in which he and his group start to unravel the complex physical\u000d\u000a      processes creating the\u000d\u000a      observed structure.\u000d\u000a    All other members of the JHI have given many public talks every year (see\u000d\u000a      evidence web page) on\u000d\u000a      all aspects of their research (see UoA9 REF outputs).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3465","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Public engagement &#8212; social, educational, and cultural: The extent\u000a      of the ancient Greeks' mechanical design ability and their degree of\u000a      astronomical knowledge has been reassessed as a direct consequence of this\u000a      Cardiff University led research. The previously unrecognised and\u000a      fascinating findings (following the publication in Nature) have\u000a      inspired worldwide interest, initiating an abundance of UK and\u000a      international media articles, broadcasts, web reviews, documentaries, a\u000a      book, website and commemorative watch. This coverage, as evidenced below,\u000a      was entirely dependent on the research which has definitively reconfigured\u000a      global public understanding of the capabilities and sophistication of an\u000a      important ancient civilisation. This is profoundly relevant both to\u000a      cultural history and to the history of technology.\u000a    From January 2008 to February 2013 Prof Edmunds and the Antikythera\u000a      Project have featured in 98 separate items of media coverage, with\u000a      newspaper, magazine and web items across the world. Examples include The\u000a        New Zealand Herald, The Courier Mail (Australia), The\u000a        International Herald Tribune, The Vancouver Sun, The\u000a        Daily Mail, The Sunday Telegraph, Cyprus Mail, Hindustan\u000a        Times, The Houston Chronicle (American's 6th\u000a      largest newspaper) and The New York Times. Websites such as National\u000a        Geographic, Scientific American, Houston Museum and\u000a      Huffington Post have featured the research (some examples are given\u000a      in refs. 5.1 to 5.3). Additionally, the Antikiythera project's website (www.antikythera-mechanism.gr)\u000a      has maintained a high position in search engines since 2006 (usually\u000a      second after Wikipedia) and attracted 561,059 visits (from Jan. 2008 -\u000a      Dec. 2012), with a high concentration of visitors in the USA, Greece, UK,\u000a      Canada, Germany, France, Australia, Netherlands, Italy and Spain, and new\u000a      visits accounting for 82%. Reconstructions have also appeared on the web,\u000a      including a Lego model of the functionality of the device (based on and\u000a      referring to the Cardiff-led research). This was constructed in 2010 and\u000a      the YouTube video (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RLPVCJjTNgk)\u000a      has had over two million views.\u000a    Several TV documentaries have featured the research. Edmunds participated\u000a      in filming for an international TV production involving ERT (Greek Radio\u000a      Television S.A.), ARTE (Association Relative &#224; la T&#233;l&#233;vision Europ&#233;enne)\u000a      and NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) in the summer of 2011. The\u000a      resulting programme The World's First Computer, Decoding the\u000a        Antikythera Mechanism was premiered in Europe (Greece, France,\u000a      Germany etc.) in April 2012. It was also broadcast on BBC 4 as The\u000a        2000 Year Old Computer, with 13 showings between May and Feb. 2013,\u000a      ranking twice in the top three of BBC 4's most popular programmes of the\u000a      week, and attracting audience figures of more than 2.5 million in 2012\u000a      [5.4]. It also won the top prize at the 2012 International Festival of\u000a      Archaeological Film in Rovereto, Italy, and the Audience Award at the 12th\u000a      International Film Festival of the Bidassoa in Spain [5.5]. The programme\u000a      was also broadcast by NOVA (PBS) in the USA in November 2012 and again in\u000a      April 2013.\u000a    A book, Decoding the Heavens (http:\/\/www.decodingtheheavens.com\/)\u000a      was stimulated by the research, and published in the UK, US, Greece,\u000a      Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Poland in 2009 and short-listed for the 2009\u000a      Royal Society Science Book Prize. The author, Jo Marchant, states that\u000a      \"research by Mike Edmunds and his colleagues is what first got me\u000a      interested in the Antikythera mechanism\" and that her primary\u000a      investigations for the publication centred on obtaining information\u000a      directly from Edmunds [5.6].\u000a    A commemorative watch based on the mechanism was designed by Hublot in\u000a      2011 (http:\/\/www.rgholland.com\/blog\/hublot-antikythera\/).\u000a      This was the first watch to be inspired by archaeological evidence. Only\u000a      four were manufactured with the intention to exhibit three in the Athens\u000a      Museum, the Muse&#233; des Arts de M&#233;tiers, and the Hublot Museum. The fourth\u000a      watch will be auctioned for charity in 2014.\u000a    The research has also been disseminated to the public at more than 50\u000a      talks given by members of the research team. Edmunds himself gave over 37\u000a      talks from 2009-2012. Audiences included members of industry (13%), school\u000a      children (34%) and the general public (53%), at locations across the UK,\u000a      Ireland, USA, Holland, Germany, Sweden and South Africa. The total number\u000a      of attendees exceeded 2,500. All of the event organisers interviewed\u000a      agreed that the research had provided the audience with new information\u000a      which had changed their view of ancient Greek technology. For example,\u000a      Russell Haines, Chair (2007-2012) of the Bristol branch of the Institution\u000a      of Engineering and Technology (IET), organised a talk in the UK and\u000a      afterwards commented that he thought \"the ancient civilisations were far\u000a      more intelligent and accomplished than even most people give them credit\u000a      for\", and that \"very complex calculations and astronomical predictions can\u000a      be made with mechanical devices\" [5.7].\u000a    The Greek government has benefited from an increase in visitor numbers to\u000a      the National Archaeological Museum in Athens where the mechanism is\u000a      exhibited\u000a      (http:\/\/www.namuseum.gr\/exhibitions\/temporary\/n_temporary-en.html).\u000a      The museum typically attracts 300,000-400,000 visitors per year. However,\u000a      records (on file) show that in the period January-June 2012 visitor\u000a      numbers have increased by 86% relative to the same period in 2011. A\u000a      special year-long exhibition of the artefacts from the shipwreck,\u000a      featuring the research opened in April 2012, contributing to this\u000a      increase. This contrasts to other museums in Greece which have suffered a\u000a      general fall in numbers.\u000a    Prior to the research, the mechanism was little known amongst the public.\u000a      Today, a Google search on \"Antikythera Mechanism\" results in 338,000 hits.\u000a    Economic gain: The research has generated sizeable economic gains,\u000a      enabling technology companies, the Greek government, media organisations\u000a      and the publishing industry to benefit. The CT scanner used in the\u000a      research was upgraded specifically for the project by X-Tec, by doubling\u000a      the operating voltage from 225 kV to 450 kV to enable penetration of the\u000a      entire mechanism. Based on the great success of the mechanism imaging,\u000a      they realised that the increased penetration meant that they could use the\u000a      equipment for other purposes. The 225 kV devices had been used to look at\u000a      solder joints in ball grid array surface mounting packages in circuit\u000a      boards. The upgraded device had sufficient penetration to look through\u000a      aircraft engine turbine blades, providing a cheaper and more effective\u000a      method of establishing internal integrity &#8212; formerly an expensive and\u000a      destructive process. This development, according to Roger Hadland,\u000a      Director of X-Tec, allowed the company to be sold to Nexus for ten times\u000a      the value of previous offers, and it was subsequently acquired by Nikon.\u000a      To date they have sold nineteen devices (called Bladerunner) and six are\u000a      in production (three have been bought by Rolls Royce). The base price is\u000a      &#163;600k with the average sale price &#163;750-800k. Roger Hadland [5.8] commented\u000a      that \"The Antikythera work was the spur to develop a new range of high\u000a      powered microfocus X-ray sources. But as soon as the equipment was\u000a      returned to the UK, we started trial scanning of turbine blades. The\u000a      detail and precision of the 2D and 3D CT information was stunning, far\u000a      better than any competition . . . X-Tek is now part of Nikon, with the\u000a      Bladerunner accounting for a large proportion of X-ray production\". The\u000a      technology has thus not only secured financial benefits for X-Tec\/Nikon\u000a      but has significantly improved vital inspection processes available to\u000a      aircraft engineering industries.

That work [3.1],\u000a      highlighted the need to find out more about the internal structure of the\u000a      artefact. This was problematic due to its fragility and archaeological\u000a      status. However, Edmunds established and led a team with the objective of\u000a      adapting and using modern non-destructive 3-D imaging technology to probe\u000a      the interior of the device. The project was awarded a research grant by\u000a      the Leverhulme Trust [3.2] in 2004 with Edmunds (Cardiff 1974-2007; now\u000a      Emeritus) as P.I. and Freeth (Cardiff. Jan 2005 - Dec. 2006; employed by\u000a      Cardiff as a contractor under the grant). Edmunds led the programme,\u000a      involving academics in the UK, Greece and the USA. Hewlett-Packard and a\u000a      corporation then called X-Tec developed customised 3-D surface and\u000a      state-of-the-art internal X-ray microfocus computed tomography systems\u000a      especially for the work.\u000a      \u000a      \u000a      Prof Mike Edmunds inspects the Antikythera Mechanism in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens\u000a          \u000a    Extensive imaging of the surface and interior of the artefact was\u000a      undertaken in Greece in 2005, following permission from the Greek\u000a      Government. The initial results of the research were announced at a\u000a      conference in Athens in November 2006, with simultaneous publication\u000a      (including favourable editorial comment) in Nature [3.3; Edmunds\u000a      was stated as the academic lead and responsible for the statistical\u000a      analysis]. The results revealed that the mechanism is indeed a genuine\u000a      artefact from around 140-100 BC, and originally contained over 30 gear\u000a      wheels. Based on the team's analysis of the teeth counts of the gears and\u000a      the mechanical structure, and their deciphering of text inscriptions on\u000a      the device, they established that it displayed the position of the Sun and\u000a      Moon in the Zodiac, the phases of the Moon and the Metonic lunar-solar\u000a      calendar. It had a dial to predict the occurrence of lunar and solar\u000a      eclipses using the Saros eclipse cycle, and a dial to indicate the\u000a      four-yearly cycle of the pan-Hellenic games, including the Olympics.\u000a      Perhaps the most extraordinary surviving feature is its ability to show\u000a      the first anomaly of the lunar motion at its correct period, which\u000a      involves two interlaced gear trains, epicyclic gearing and a\u000a      variable-speed device, showing great sophistication of mechanical design.\u000a      The mechanism almost certainly originally showed planetary positions, and\u000a      although most of this part is lost, the surviving evidence is leading to\u000a      interesting speculation about its possible structure. Subsequent research\u000a      papers led by Edmunds appeared in 2011 [3.4, 3.5].\u000a    The Antikythera mechanism is both the earliest known geared mechanism\u000a      (with the earliest known scales or dials) and the earliest known\u000a      mechanical calculator.

Its close collaboration with the AIG ensures that\u000a      technology is adapted swiftly\u000a      and appropriately for commercial, civil and governmental users, and that\u000a      knowledge transfer and\u000a      exchange between academia and industry is rapid.\u000a    According to QMCI Managing Director, Dr Richard Wylde [5.2], \"Since 2008\u000a      the aggregate\u000a      business volume transacted by QMCI is in excess of &#163;4 million, of which\u000a      more than 80% depends\u000a      directly on contributions made by the AIG\". More than 90% of the activity\u000a      is exported (30%\u000a      Europe; 30% US; 30% Far East). The company employs five highly skilled\u000a      technical staff in Cardiff,\u000a      makes use of AIG academic consultants and utilises experienced local\u000a      representatives in Japan,\u000a      China, and Korea.\u000a    The interaction of QMCI with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array\u000a        (ALMA) project (2009-2012) is\u000a      a good example of the economic spin-out of AIG technology. ALMA, the\u000a      world's largest ground-based\u000a      telescope, a 66-antenna facility in Chile, required development of a\u000a      special filter to enable\u000a      the telescope to make unique solar observations, without saturation of the\u000a      sensitive detectors, or\u000a      UV damage to underlying optical components. The specification for this\u000a      solar attenuator was very\u000a      precise and could not be met by any technique which ALMA scientists had\u000a      investigated. Using their\u000a      metal mesh filter capabilities [3.5], AIG academics and QMCI technical\u000a      staff designed and\u000a      prototyped several devices which were tested on-site and approved by ALMA.\u000a      By March 2012,\u000a      ninety of these highly specialised devices had been delivered to the\u000a      project. During the same\u000a      period QMCI provided AIG anti-reflection coated quartz vacuum windows and\u000a      cooled THz\u000a      polarisers for more than half of the ALMA receivers, generating &gt;&#163;1M\u000a      business. Gie Han Tan, EU\u000a      Front End IPT Manager of the ALMA project states [5.3], \"Only with these\u000a      innovative, high-quality\u000a      components developed and manufactured by QMC Instruments Ltd., the\u000a      exceptional sensitivity of\u000a      the ALMA sub-millimetre receivers could be fully exploited. The solar\u000a      attenuators provided by\u000a      QMCI Ltd to the ALMA Project enable a unique capability\" (sic).\u000a    Further evidence of economic exploitation through sole-supplier status is\u000a      provided by the sale of\u000a      AIG polarizers and windows to the HIFI instrument [5.4] and quasi optical\u000a      filters to the PACS\u000a      instrument [5.5], both on the Herschel Space Observatory. These\u000a      bespoke components were\u000a      unavailable through any other source, met full flight quality assurance\u000a      specification and generated\u000a      sales to QMCI in excess of &#163;0.5M.\u000a    Economic impact: third party exploitation\u000a    QMCI products are on the market to end users across a range of\u000a      industries, building on research\u000a      undertaken by the AIG for the Herschel and Planck\u000a      satellites [3.2, 3.3], and using the same\u000a      research-funded development skills and facilities.

The International Thermonuclear\u000a      Experimental\u000a      Reactor project is currently building the world's largest\u000a      experimental tokamak nuclear fusion\u000a      reactor with the aims to make the long-awaited transition from\u000a      experimental studies of plasma\u000a      physics to full-scale electricity-producing fusion power plants. QMCI\u000a      supplied AIG bolometric\u000a      detector technology to JET and now to ITER, representing, according to\u000a      Alan Costley, former Head\u000a      of the ITER Diagnostic Section, \"a major breakthrough\" in the creation of\u000a      a powerful diagnostic\u000a      technique to enable the \"study and understanding of many important\u000a      physical phenomena that\u000a      occur in the plasmas, some of which limit plasma fusion performance\"\u000a      [5.6]. The sustained\u000a      application of Cardiff research and continued collaboration with the\u000a      fusion industry has led to the\u000a      incorporation of the same AIG technology on every major tokamak device and\u000a      all major next-\u000a      generation nuclear fusion reactors around the world: including, within the\u000a      REF period, EAST in\u000a      China, KSTAR in Korea and a design contract for the future fast-scanning\u000a      Michelson\u000a      Interferometer for ITER-India.\u000a    THz camera: In 2010 the giant Japanese corporation,\u000a      NEC commissioned QMCI to provide a filter, based on\u000a      unique AIG technology [3.5], in order to reject high\u000a      frequency radiation in a THz camera they were developing.\u000a      The inclusion of the filter solved the serious issue of ghost\u000a      image generation in the device and cleared the way for the\u000a      launch of the Soltec THz Imager instrument (see figure)\u000a      [5.7]. In 2011 the first successful use of the camera by\u000a      rescue workers in fire-scenes was reported and Naoki\u000a      Oda, Executive Engineer for NEC states [5.8] that, \"This\u000a      world leading filter technology is very important for the\u000a      success of the THz imager\". The AIG filter technology is now a standard\u000a      component (IRV-TF030)\u000a      in these cameras, with more than 40 units sold since 2011 at a total\u000a      revenue of ~ &#163;1M.\u000a    \u000a   The Soltec THz Imager (IRV-TF083) [5.7]. Product IRV-TF030, built and mounted by the AIG, can be seen as the front copper-coloured element of the camera.\u000a   \u000a    A new generation of detector devices has been developed by the AIG\u000a      and has recently been\u000a      introduced to the commercial market by QMCI (2012). These offer\u000a      ultra-low noise, single pixel and\u000a      array detectors that operate in entirely mechanical cooled systems. Before\u000a      this innovation,\u000a      sensitive THz detectors were restricted to single pixel devices cooled by\u000a      scarce and expensive\u000a      liquid helium, dependent on specialised skills using a process that is\u000a      costly, time-consuming and\u000a      potentially dangerous. According to Masa Fukumuro (Sales Manager of\u000a      Japanese company\u000a      Infrared Limited), \"QMCI offers the only commercially available,\u000a      cryogen-free THz bolometer\u000a      system. It has had a big effect in Japan, China and also in Asian\u000a      countries where supply of liquid\u000a      cryogens is a problem in the last two years\" [5.9]. Richard Wylde,\u000a      Managing Director of QMCI [5.2]\u000a      states that, \"To date, and in the period September 2012 &#8212; November 2013,\u000a      &#163;800k sales of these\u000a      systems have been made\", and is confident that sales figures will grow\u000a      with such a revolutionary\u000a      new product range, thus securing future revenue and jobs for this SME.\u000a    * Both the AIG and QMCI were formerly at Queen Mary, University\u000a      of London; however the\u000a      revenue and impact claimed here are as a result of technological research\u000a      and developments\u000a      made in the last 13 years at Cardiff.

This research has been key to the UK\u000a      involvement in virtually all\u000a      THz telescopes worldwide and has largely been supported through successive\u000a      PPARC and STFC\u000a      rolling grants3.1 (&gt;&#163;10.5M in the last 13 years at Cardiff).\u000a    Prof. Matt Griffin (Deputy Head of School and Director of Research,\u000a      Cardiff 2001-) is Principal\u000a      Investigator for the SPIRE instrument on board the Herschel Space\u000a      Observatory, for which the AIG\u000a      designed and manufactured flight hardware [3.2]; Prof. Peter Ade (2001-)\u000a      is a Co-Investigator for\u000a      the High Frequency Instrument on board the Planck satellite for\u000a      which the AIG designed, built,\u000a      integrated and tested the focal plane unit [3.3, 3.4]. Two other\u000a      instruments on board Herschel also\u000a      relied on crucial AIG devices (provided via commercial contracts). Herschel\u000a      and Planck, launched\u000a      in 2009, have now completed their hugely successful operational\u000a      programmes. Already there have\u000a      been more than 1250 scientific publications resulting from the\u000a      unprecedented astronomy research\u000a      possible with these instruments.\u000a    The technological challenges of detecting astronomical THz radiation are\u000a      considerable; small\u000a      signals at long wavelengths must be detected in the presence of much\u000a      larger backgrounds. The\u000a      work of the AIG has been central to the success of astronomy in this\u000a      region of the spectrum over\u000a      the last 30 years. This has required the development of highly sensitive\u000a      detectors operating at\u000a      ultra-low temperatures (less than 1 K), specialised filters and optics to\u000a      block unwanted radiation\u000a      and heat, and innovative low-loss optical designs. These developments have\u000a      been applied to\u000a      instruments for ground-based facilities, balloon-borne experiments and\u000a      many satellite projects.\u000a      They have resulted in pioneering surveys of the remnant light from the Big\u000a      Bang and to significant\u000a      progress in our understanding of the early universe. Since 2001,\u000a      scientific and technological\u000a      publications of the academic members of the AIG number in excess of 600.\u000a    The AIG has capabilities unique in the world in quasi-optical devices and\u000a      meta-materials [3.5, 3.6],\u000a      so that within the THz astronomy community the AIG is the sole provider of\u000a      many innovative optical\u000a      devices and materials crucial to successful THz detection and imaging.\u000a      These devices include\u000a      band-defining filters [3.5] and thermal shaders to reduce unwanted\u000a      background radiation, meta-\u000a      material anti-reflection coatings [3.6] for vacuum windows, and\u000a      photolithographic polarizers &#8212; all of\u000a      which have seen either invention or significant development at Cardiff\u000a      since 2001, with much of\u000a      that development associated with the prototyping and provision of\u000a      components for Herschel and\u000a      Planck. The AIG continues to drive the state-of-the-art in these\u000a      areas, and this is evidenced by\u000a      continued STFC support of this activity [3.1].\u000a    The AIG also has a long track record of expertise with ultra-sensitive\u000a      THz detectors [3.4, 3.7],\u000a      including superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers and\u000a      Lumped Element Kinetic\u000a      Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs) [3.7]. The latter were invented by Dr. Simon\u000a      Doyle (Cardiff PDRA\u000a      01.01.07 to 30.04.12, Lecturer 01.05.12 to present) and have most recently\u000a      been incorporated into\u000a      a Cardiff THz passive imaging camera [3.8], currently being developed\u000a      commercially by QMCI Ltd.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3467","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","UK Space Agency","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    At the beginning of 2008 (15 months before the Herschel launch)\u000d\u000a      the UK Herschel Outreach Group (HOG), chaired by Griffin, was\u000d\u000a      formed to coordinate a national outreach and PR programme. It includes\u000d\u000a      members from all UK SPIRE institutes (Cardiff, Imperial College, UCL-MSSL,\u000d\u000a      UKATC, STFC-RAL, Sussex), several other UK institutes involved in Herschel\u000d\u000a      science, and the STFC Science in Society team. Funding was secured\u000d\u000a      via two STFC Science in Society grants (&#163;135k; ST\/H000453\/1 and\u000d\u000a      ST\/J000248\/1), covering 2009-2013, including a Cardiff-based half-time Herschel\u000d\u000a      Outreach Officer (HOO), Dr. Chris North, in post from Oct. 2009, and\u000d\u000a      additional funding under the Cardiff SPIRE project grants (~&#163;15k) for\u000d\u000a      outreach expenses. A state-of-the art infrared camera and two scale\u000d\u000a      models, 1:10 and 1:4, of the Herschel spacecraft were procured\u000d\u000a      using &#163;30k from School of Physics and Astronomy internal funds (a 50%\u000d\u000a      contribution to the 1:4 model was also made by RAL). These have proved to\u000d\u000a      be major draws at talks, events and exhibitions. HOO tasks include acting\u000d\u000a      as HOG secretary, executing the PR and outreach plans formulated by the\u000d\u000a      group, preparing press releases in consultation with UKSA, STFC, ESA, and\u000d\u000a      scientists in over 20 UK institutes, and developing and maintaining the UK\u000d\u000a      Herschel Outreach website. A national network of scientists and\u000d\u000a      engineers from Cardiff and other UK Herschel institutes was also\u000d\u000a      established to assist with events (schools visits, public talks,\u000d\u000a      exhibitions, etc.), several of whom have undergone media and\u000d\u000a      communications training.\u000d\u000a    The Herschel outreach programme is led by Cardiff but is a\u000d\u000a      national activity. In this case study we focus explicitly on impact\u000d\u000a      derived from Cardiff-specific activity on the SPIRE instrument and science\u000d\u000a      programme.\u000d\u000a    Media exposure: During the REF period, 95 items of media coverage\u000d\u000a      have publicised the technical and scientific work of the Cardiff team.\u000d\u000a      This includes articles, referring specifically to Cardiff's involvement,\u000d\u000a      in UK and foreign newspapers including The Independent, The Sunday\u000d\u000a        Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Calgary Herald, Asian News\u000d\u000a        International, The Qatar News Agency, and many more. Herschel\u000d\u000a      was designated number 7 in Time Magazine's Inventions of the Year\u000d\u000a      in 2009 (http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/specials\/packages\/completelist\/0,29569,1934027,00.html).\u000aCardiff\u000a      staff have made many appearances on BBC TV and radio including the Today\u000a        Programme, Science in Action and Radio 5 Live. A two-part\u000d\u000a      Radio-4 documentary, The Herschel Space Telescope was first\u000d\u000a      broadcast in 2009 and followed Matt Griffin and the UK SPIRE team before\u000d\u000a      and after the launch (http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b00nvt8r).\u000d\u000a      It has reached over 1.5 million listeners, and was featured as radio pick\u000d\u000a      of the day by The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, and The\u000a        Times [5.1]. There have been at least 24 BBC News website articles,\u000d\u000a      by BBC Science Correspondent Jonathan Amos and others, highlighting the\u000d\u000a      technology and science results (many based on direct collaboration and\u000d\u000a      contact between the BBC journalists and Cardiff team members, and 11 of\u000d\u000a      which feature quotes from Cardiff staff). They were typically accessed\u000d\u000a      100,000-200,000 times in the first 24 hours. Jonathan Amos wrote: \"As a\u000d\u000a      journalist, I am constantly looking for a strong narrative and compelling\u000d\u000a      imagery. Herschel has consistently provided both since launch. . .\u000d\u000a      The SPIRE group has routinely recognised those pieces of research that\u000d\u000a      will reach out best to the general public, and have been able to convey\u000d\u000a      this interest in very engaging terms. The website (http:\/\/herschel.cf.ac.uk\/),\u000a      also, is a model for how to present sometimes complex findings. Far\u000d\u000a      infrared pictures are not very easy to negotiate with a lay eye. The\u000d\u000a      website's stepwise approach, using annotation and very clear terms, is a\u000d\u000a      big help in this respect.\" [5.2]\u000d\u000a    Outreach web site: The UK Herschel outreach website\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/herschel.cf.ac.uk\/) maintained at Cardiff by the HOO, contains\u000d\u000a      up-to-date Herschel information with images, results, news\u000d\u000a      stories, press releases, and downloadable material. It is one of the most\u000d\u000a      comprehensive websites about Herschel in the world. Traffic\u000d\u000a      statistics (on file) show over 100,000 unique visitors since monitoring\u000d\u000a      began (Aug. 2009) with an increasing trend and peaks when press releases\u000d\u000a      are issued. Links from popular sites such as BBC News provide excellent\u000d\u000a      reach. Educational resources, and \"fun\" activities for the casual visitor\u000d\u000a      can be downloaded, and that section has been visited over 5,000 times.\u000d\u000a      Materials include classroom activities, posters, self-assemble cardboard\u000d\u000a      models, and links to other educational resources. Chromoscope, a\u000d\u000a      tool to show the sky at multiple wavelengths including Herschel's,\u000d\u000a      was developed by the HOO and others (http:\/\/www.chromoscope.net\/;\u000d\u000a      hosting funded by Cardiff Physics &amp; Astronomy). Chromoscope is\u000d\u000a      one of the most popular astronomy tools online (more than 3 million unique\u000d\u000a      visitors since Nov. 2009), and is used extensively on the Herschel\u000d\u000a      UK website to display results.\u000d\u000a    Schools programme: We have developed and implemented a schools\u000d\u000a      programme with the assistance of teaching professionals. It consists of\u000d\u000a      interactive lesson plans, talks, and demonstrations using Herschel\u000d\u000a      to illustrate several subject areas: multi-wavelength astronomy,\u000d\u000a      spacecraft engineering, space dust, cosmology, and the solar system.\u000d\u000a      Resources were initially trialled by several SPIRE team members from\u000d\u000a      Cardiff and RAL at Monkton Combe School in Feb. 2009, when Cardiff staff,\u000d\u000a      post-docs and students, delivered a week-long Scientists in Residence\u000d\u000a      programme at the school. The programme, for pupils in years 7-13, was\u000d\u000a      based on the science and technology of the Herschel and Planck\u000d\u000a      missions, and covered aspects of astronomy from the Solar System to\u000d\u000a      Cosmology. The entire week was well received, with 90% giving their\u000d\u000a      sessions at least 3 out of 5 in terms of amount learnt, and 65% giving a\u000d\u000a      mark of at least 4. Sam Chilcott, Monkton Combe science teacher, wrote:\u000d\u000a      \"One of the most fulfilling weeks of my professional career was when the\u000d\u000a      Cardiff Astronomy team came over to Monkton. To see the enthusiasm\u000d\u000a      engendered in the pupils, not only in that week, but in the months and\u000d\u000a      years afterwards - indeed, they are still talking about it!\" [5.3].\u000d\u000a    The Herschel Schools Show was developed by science made\u000d\u000a        simple, an outreach company linked to the School, in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with the Cardiff SPIRE team. Aimed at years 7-11 (KS3 and GCSE), It\u000d\u000a      demonstrates aspects of Herschel science and technology. First run\u000d\u000a      in 2007, it was updated to include Herschel scientific results.\u000d\u000a      The show has been given ~30 times during the REF period, to a total\u000d\u000a      audience of ~4,000. Evaluation questionnaires (on file) showed that 87% of\u000d\u000a      respondents rated the show as very good or excellent. Instructively, only\u000d\u000a      25% of them had more than a passing interest in astronomy before seeing\u000d\u000a      the show [5.4].\u000d\u000a    This activity was later developed by the HOO into a package that has been\u000d\u000a      distributed to teachers as part of our teacher Continuing Professional\u000d\u000a      Development (CPD) programme which he organises. A series in 2010 across\u000d\u000a      Wales (Aberystwth, Cardiff, Camarthen, Llantarnum, Wrexham) reached 130\u000d\u000a      teachers, and sessions at the National Space Centre and Science Learning\u000d\u000a      Centre, Leicester, have reached 90 teachers. Feedback from teachers\u000d\u000a      attending (on file) was excellent with 78% indicating that they would use\u000d\u000a      the resources in their teaching. David Grace, secondary school teacher and\u000d\u000a      PGCE tutor commented that \". . the subject matter is generally very\u000d\u000a      motivating to most pupils across the ability range\" [5.5]. With each\u000d\u000a      secondary school teacher reaching ~100 new pupils each year (based on 1000\u000d\u000a      pupils per school over 5 school years [5.6]), and with 1.6 - 2 physics\u000d\u000a      teachers per school [5.7], the total reach of these sessions is over\u000d\u000a      20,000 pupils per year. A Cardiff University I&amp;E fund award of &#163;9k was\u000d\u000a      made in Apr. 2012 for further support of a Welsh schools programme, and\u000d\u000a      the HOO has developed close links with the University's Schools\u000d\u000a      Partnership Officer and Community Engagement Team. Our Herschel\u000d\u000a      teacher CPD work has helped us to establish a Cardiff role (Gomez Co-I) in\u000d\u000a      Inspiring Science Education, a European Union project to develop\u000d\u000a      and deploy science educational resources across Europe. The &#163;158k Cardiff\u000d\u000a      allocation will employ Dr. North when the HOO grant terminates in Nov.\u000d\u000a      2013, in a role that will continue to use Herschel-based material\u000d\u000a      for a European-wide educational programme. In addition, a Welsh Government\u000d\u000a      grant of &#163;73k (Gomez PI) has recently been awarded (Oct. 2013) to bring\u000d\u000a      our astronomy resources, including Herschel, into Welsh primary\u000d\u000a      schools.\u000d\u000a    Public talks, exhibitions and events: During the REF period 75\u000d\u000a      popular talks on Herschel have been given by Cardiff University\u000d\u000a      staff at numerous venues in England and Wales, with total audience numbers\u000d\u000a      in excess of 6,500. Talks have been very well received and we have a\u000d\u000a      substantial collection of very complimentary thank-you e-mails and letters\u000d\u000a      on file. As an example, in an audience evaluation carried out by the\u000d\u000a      organisers of an East of England Engineering Science and Technology\u000d\u000a      Association (EESTA) event in Nov. 2012 at which Matt Griffin spoke, out of\u000d\u000a      172 responses 136 rated his talk as \"excellent\" and 32 as \"good\" [5.8].\u000d\u000a      Eleven major public events have been organised by the HOO and supported by\u000d\u000a      Cardiff staff. Proposals were successful for the Royal Society Summer\u000d\u000a      Exhibition in both 2009 and 2012. Visitors numbered around 5,000 in 2009,\u000d\u000a      and 14,000 in 2012. Stands at the Big Bang Fair were bid for and\u000d\u000a      awarded in four successive years (2010-2013), leading to personal\u000d\u000a      invitations to return each year. Cardiff funds and staff time were used to\u000d\u000a      support these events, and the 1:4 scale model was displayed. Each Big\u000d\u000a        Bang Fair was attended by around 35,000 people, mostly secondary\u000d\u000a      school pupils. In Oct.-Nov. 2010, the 1:4 model was provided for a\u000d\u000a      temporary astronomy gallery at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff -\u000d\u000a      during this period ~20,000 people visited the museum. In Jan. 2012 another\u000d\u000a      NMW exhibition included Cardiff staff and Herschel-related\u000d\u000a      activities; 3000 people visited the museum that day. Herschel-themed\u000a      products are given away as freebies at events and exhibitions, bought from\u000d\u000a      a combination of internal Cardiff funds (~50%) and from the Cardiff-based\u000d\u000a      STFC SiS grant (~50%).\u000d\u000a    In summary, our Herschel research and accompanying PR and\u000d\u000a      outreach programme have given the public valuable and exciting insights\u000d\u000a      into science and technology. Importantly, this extends to enhancing\u000d\u000a      educational learning and stimulating engagement with STEM subjects in\u000d\u000a      schools. With many more scientific discoveries to come from Herschel's\u000a      database of observations, the outreach programme will be sustained, and\u000d\u000a      contacts with educators and the media will be continued.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    We have formulated and executed an extensive public engagement and\u000d\u000a      outreach programme based on our leading technical and scientific\u000d\u000a      involvement in the Herschel Space Observatory, a &#8364;1 billion\u000d\u000a      astronomical satellite which was launched in 2009 and operated until April\u000d\u000a      2013.

The project\u000d\u000a      started in 1998 following approval by the European Space Agency (ESA) of\u000d\u000a      the instrument proposal. It is led by the Principal Investigator (PI)\u000d\u000a      Griffin. (The PI is responsible to ESA for all aspects of the design,\u000d\u000a      construction, testing and delivery of the instrument, and for in-flight\u000d\u000a      calibration, data processing software, and operations support).

Thenceforth the Cardiff Astronomy Instrumentation Group led the\u000d\u000a      project to construct and operate SPIRE.\u000d\u000a    Elements of the SPIRE instrument were built by Cardiff University and\u000d\u000a      various participating institutes, and the instrument was assembled and\u000d\u000a      tested at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory prior to delivery, in April\u000d\u000a      2007, for installation in the Herschel spacecraft. To date, Herschel\u000d\u000a      has produced over 700 refereed scientific papers, about 40% of which use\u000d\u000a      SPIRE instrument data.\u000d\u000a    UK funding support for Herschel has been provided successively by\u000d\u000a      PPARC, STFC, and UKSA.

Following the end of the\u000d\u000a      operational phase, we are now embarking upon a three-year post-operations\u000d\u000a      programme designed to finalise the data-processing software, and to\u000d\u000a      re-process all the SPIRE data for permanent archiving.

From the beginning of GZ, it was clear\u000a      the volunteers wanted to do more than simply contribute their visual\u000a      classifications. Within two weeks of the GZ launch, the team was swamped\u000a      with thousands of e-mails requesting information or reporting interesting\u000a      objects. The volunteers' overwhelming desire to communicate inspired the\u000a      creation of the GZ internet forum[1], which encouraged users to\u000a      communicate with each other, thus allowing many of their basic queries to\u000a      be answered by other, more experienced, volunteers, and also allowed the\u000a      volunteers to share their thoughts.\u000a    Through the forum, several rare classes of object were discovered by the\u000a      public, of which \"Hanny's Voorwerp\" is the most famous. Hanny, a\u000a      Dutch school teacher, discovered a strangely coloured outflow from a\u000a      nearby galaxy, which appears to be the light echo from a supermassive\u000a      black hole. Her object is now the focus of significant research (24\u000a      publications to date) and was memorialized in a popular comic book[2].\u000a      Hanny is outspoken about the impact of GZ on her life, giving invited\u000a      talks and TV appearances about her experience, and she serves as an\u000a      excellent role model for volunteers (especially young women) interested in\u000a      astronomy and citizen science.\u000a    In addition, several volunteers have organized science projects of their\u000a      own making. The largest such project is the search for irregular galaxies\u000a      that do not fit currently recognized classification schemes, while other\u000a      volunteers have been inspired to start research careers e.g. Alice\u000a      Shephard, a forum moderator, is studying a masters degree in Astronomy at\u000a      QMW. Galaxy Zoo is also a valuable educational tool (e.g. integrated into\u000a      the curricula at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich) and is part of\u000a      \"Zooteach\" where educators share teaching plans and resources [3].\u000a    The GZ forum boasts more than half a million postings on nearly 18,000\u000a      topics (as of April 2013) making it similar in size to the largest\u000a      football fan forums. In addition to the forum, the GZ blog has become the\u000a      main mechanism by which scientists communicate with volunteers to provide\u000a      updates on the academic research being done with their classifications.\u000a      The GZ blog presently has hundreds of articles, and ICG member Karen\u000a      Masters is a frequent contributor. Over the last year (2012-13), the\u000a      Zooniverse blogs have attracted 86,000 unique viewings.\u000a    GZ has clearly had a major impact on public engagement in science. An\u000a      early quantitative survey (2008) of GZ volunteers [4] found they come from\u000a      a range of educations and ages, and have an evenly distributed gender\u000a      balance. According to this survey, the major motivation for volunteering\u000a      was a desire to contribute to scientific research (40%). In a more recent\u000a      (2012) online survey of over 2000 GZ volunteers [5], 87% confirmed GZ had\u000a      changed their behaviour in at least one of: (i) more visits to museums and\u000a      planetariums (34%); (ii) read more about science (68%); (iii) study more\u000a      formally (34%), and (iv) carry out their own research (12%). For\u000a      under-18s, 70% were encouraged to study a degree and 47% said GZ helped\u000a      their schoolwork. Overall, 39% of GZ volunteers said they had done more\u000a      astronomy (e.g. amateur observations) since starting GZ, and 75% would\u000a      recommend GZ to others. Finally, quantitative learning assessments given\u000a      to GZ participants indicate the volunteers do perform better at correctly\u000a      answering conceptually challenging questions on the astrophysics of\u000a      galaxies. Two studies show that, on average, the most experienced GZ\u000a      participants outperform their novice counterparts by as much as a full\u000a      letter grade (10%) [6]\u000a    The success of GZ inspired the creation of several follow-on projects,\u000a      e.g. a Google-funded project at Portsmouth asked the public to draw on\u000a      SDSS images in \"Google Sky\" to help measure the size and orientation of\u000a      galactic bars[7]. Moreover, there now exists an array of different \"zoos\"\u000a      that span diverse disciplines and are organized under the common banner of\u000a      the \"Zooniverse\" [8], hosted and led by Oxford University. The Zooniverse\u000a      now has more than 20 projects running simultaneously, from climate change\u000a      to cancer research, with over 850,000 worldwide volunteers (08\/2013). The\u000a      GZ methodology has inspired the \"Citizen Science Alliance,\" which holds\u000a      regular calls for proposals of science projects that would benefit from\u000a      citizen science involvement. In August 2013, the University of Portsmouth\u000a      officially joined the CSA, based on our long-term association with GZ, and\u000a      will embark on new Portsmouth-specific Zoo projects.\u000a    Galaxy Zoo has emphatically demonstrated the power of citizen science,\u000a      and has inspired new and exciting projects. There are now several\u000a      commercially-orientated citizen science projects including \"DIYgenomics\",\u000a      a mobile phone app to look for variations in genes, and \"Crowdflower\",\u000a      which provides businesses assess to citizen scientist volunteers [9].\u000a      Also, Zooniverse projects like \"Seafloor Explorer\" have commercial\u000a      partners. These projects clearly illustrate the potential economic impacts\u000a      of citizen science and Portsmouth scientists Joe Cox and Karen Masters\u000a      have a funded EPSRC Digital Economy grant to research such potential\u000a      further [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Galaxy Zoo (GZ) is among the most successful online citizen science\u000a      project ever undertaken, relying on hundreds of thousands of volunteers to\u000a      classify galaxy images.

Why and how these galaxies relate\u000a      to each other remains a mystery. With the advent of large digital\u000a      detectors in the 1990s, astronomers began surveying large areas of the\u000a      sky, detecting millions of new galaxies, allowing them to examine the\u000a      properties of galaxies to greater precision. For example, in 2011, the\u000a      celebrated Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) released the largest image of\u000a      the sky ever obtained: more than a trillion pixels containing 208 million\u000a      galaxies[1]. Professor Bob Nichol has been a key member of the SDSS since\u000a      1993, first at the Universities of Chicago and Carnegie Mellon in the USA,\u000a      then at the ICG, Portsmouth since 08\/2004.\u000a    It is impossible to visually inspect each galaxy in massive digital\u000a      imaging datasets like the SDSS, and modern, computer-based algorithms\u000a      cannot yet unambiguously determine whether a galaxy is spiral or\u000a      elliptical. This makes it difficult to uncover the true evolutionary\u000a      history of galaxies, as such morphological information reveals the\u000a      dynamical nature of galaxies e.g. merger of two smaller galaxies\u000a      (elliptical) or a disk of stars made through the accretion of gas\u000a      (spiral).\u000a    Galaxy Zoo was inspired by this limitation and was feasible only because\u000a      of the easy access to SDSS images [1,2]. Samples of elliptical galaxies\u000a      from the initial SDSS, by Bob Nichol and collaborators [3], relied on\u000a      computer-based methods as such galaxies are often \"red\" (i.e., evolved)\u000a      with no obvious star formation (a correlation that is not perfect, as\u000a      shown by the first GZ results). To circumvent this challenge, Daniel\u000a      Thomas, Claudia Maraston, and collaborators at Oxford University built a\u000a      complete sample of elliptical galaxies based solely on their appearance.\u000a      The team started by inspecting 50,000 SDSS galaxy images and ultimately\u000a      created the MOrphologically Selected Ellipticals in SDSS (MOSES) sample:\u000a      an order of magnitude larger than any visually inspected sample created at\u000a      that time [4].\u000a    MOSES proved the need for dependable morphological classifications of\u000a      SDSS galaxies, but it was unrealistic for a few researchers to scale MOSES\u000a      to the level of the whole SDSS. Inspired by \"Stardust@Home\" (at Berkeley),\u000a      a collaboration including several ICG researchers (Bob Nichol, Steven\u000a      Bamford, Daniel Thomas), crowd-sourced the visual classification of the\u000a      SDSS galaxies to the public via an online Web interface. On July 11, 2007,\u000a      the GZ project was born [5]. Within twelve hours, GZ began receiving\u000a      20,000 classifications per hour (peaking at 70,000 per hour), driven by a\u000a      global media interest in the project. After 10 days, the public had\u000a      submitted 8 million classifications; by early 2008, when the first GZ\u000a      research papers were published, 100,000 volunteers had inspected more than\u000a      900,000 SDSS galaxies, each 38 times on average.\u000a    GZ data has enabled key new findings in the field of galaxy evolution,\u000a      led by ICG scientists [6]. Now an internationally renowned research and\u000a      public engagement project, GZ has been recognized for its innovative\u000a      approach to the analysis of massive datasets and has spawned a\u000a      \"Zooniverse\" of citizen science projects.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4325","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","UK Space Agency"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The selection and design of Euclid by ESA is a direct impact of the BAO\u000d\u000a      research done at the ICG over the last decade. As outlined above, ICG\u000d\u000a      researchers have established BAO as an important technique for measuring\u000d\u000a      dark energy. The importance of Euclid goes beyond academia, with major\u000d\u000a      economic and societal impact. This case study highlights such impact so\u000d\u000a      far until August 2013), while also highlighting the direct involvement of\u000d\u000a      ICG researchers in the present and future development of Euclid.\u000d\u000a    Euclid is a 1.2metre telescope satellite mission built through a\u000d\u000a      partnership of ESA, industry and the Euclid Consortium (EC) [1]. In total,\u000d\u000a      the whole mission hardware will cost over 600M euros [2], funded by\u000d\u000a      European governments via their subscriptions to ESA, with a further 400M\u000d\u000a      euros from the national funding agencies for the Euclid instruments and\u000d\u000a      the Science Ground Segment (SGS), or data processing, both performed by\u000d\u000a      the EC [3]. UK industry is expected to receive approximately 16% (100M\u000d\u000a      euros) of this total mission hardware funding [4] as part of the \"juste\u000d\u000a      retour\" from ESA. Such space science projects are part of a growing sector\u000d\u000a      of the UK economy, now worth over &#163;7.5 billion [5].\u000d\u000a    Euclid was born from two \"Cosmic Visions 2015-2025\" proposals\u000d\u000a      (DUNE &amp; SPACE); ESA then instigated a \"Concept Advisory Team\"\u000d\u000a      (CAT) in early 2008 to study merging these two concepts, and Bob Nichol\u000d\u000a      was one of the 12 European scientists involved in the CAT [3]. The CAT\u000d\u000a      recommended (in May 2008) the first concept of Euclid, concluding: \"all\u000d\u000a        members of the CAT agreed that a combined mission which involved probes\u000d\u000a        of both weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations offered a superb\u000d\u000a        mission whose combined strengths were very significantly greater than\u000d\u000a        either of them separately.\" This conclusion was based in part on the\u000d\u000a      BAO research performed by ICG researchers [9,10].\u000d\u000a    The first industrial studies of Euclid started in late 2008 (for one\u000d\u000a      year) with initial ESA contracts granted to two European companies\u000d\u000a      (Thales-Alenia Space and Astrium). These assessment studies were then\u000d\u000a      followed by two definition phase studies (from 2010 to 2012; 18 months) by\u000d\u000a      the same two companies. These contracts were worth a total of nearly a\u000d\u000a      million euros for each company [3]. These industrial studies were managed\u000d\u000a      by ESA but with scientific oversight from a series of official ESA science\u000d\u000a      teams (namely \"Euclid Science Study Team\", \"Euclid Optimisation\u000d\u000a        Advisory Team\" and \"Euclid Interim Work Study Team\"), which\u000d\u000a      all included Bob Nichol from the ICG. He was the only scientist in Europe\u000d\u000a      with an unbroken involvement in this series of science teams and had\u000d\u000a      significant input into official Science Requirements Document [6]\u000d\u000a      used by industry to design Euclid. Also, since May 2009, Will Percival has\u000d\u000a      been one of only four Science Coordinators responsible for organizing the\u000d\u000a      scientists within the Euclid Consortium [9].\u000d\u000a    On June 20th 2012, Euclid was official adopted by ESA, and on\u000d\u000a      June 27th 2013, Thales-Alenia were selected as the prime\u000d\u000a      contractor of the satellite with a cost of 322.5M euros [7] (the Euclid\u000d\u000a      payload has been assigned to Astrium SAS). Bob Nichol remains part of the\u000d\u000a      ESA oversight of this mission [9,10] (including industrial contractors) as\u000d\u000a      a member of the official \"Euclid Science Team\" (EST), which\u000d\u000a      includes only 12 scientists from Europe and USA. His official title on the\u000d\u000a      team is \"BAO Scientist\".\u000d\u000a    Euclid has entered the final design phase with the successful selection\u000d\u000a      of all the major industrial and university contractors with design reviews\u000d\u000a      schedule for mid-2014. For example, the Euclid visual camera (VIS) will be\u000d\u000a      constructed in the UK by UCL\/MSSL at a total projected cost of\u000d\u000a      approximately &#163;7.5M, and includes scientists and engineers at Open\u000d\u000a      University and e2v to design and test new detectors [8]. This work is\u000d\u000a      already underway and employs a number of people in UK industry via grants\u000d\u000a      from the UK Space Agency (UKSA) and ESA e.g., e2v will receive over 30M\u000d\u000a      euros directly from ESA to purchase the final detectors [4]. Since the\u000d\u000a      initial studies in 2008, and including current commitments, UK funding\u000d\u000a      agencies (STFC, UKSA) will have spent &#163;7.455M by 2015 [4].\u000d\u000a    Finally, the Euclid Consortium is responsible for the instrument\u000d\u000a      operation and data centres (Science Ground Segment, SGS), which is a major\u000d\u000a      computational challenge (costing over 150M euros in total across Europe).\u000d\u000a      The SGS will be designed and implemented in laboratories and universities\u000d\u000a      across Europe, and in the UK [10], we are planning &#163;17M investment in new\u000d\u000a      computing hardware for this work. The SGS provides an investment in UK\u000d\u000a      businesses as well as significant training opportunities for software\u000d\u000a      engineers, students and scientists. At the ICG, Will Percival's prominent\u000d\u000a      role in Euclid and BAO research has resulted in a European Research\u000d\u000a      Council (ERC) Starting Grant entitled \"Cosmology from Next Generation\u000d\u000a        of Galaxy Redshift Surveys\" for a total of 880k euros (07\/2008 to\u000d\u000a      07\/2013). Moreover, Percival and Nichol have also received funding from\u000d\u000a      the UKSA for SGS and Euclid science management work packages totalling\u000d\u000a      &#163;395k to 2015.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Euclid is a new M-class satellite selected by the European Space Agency\u000d\u000a      (ESA) to study the dark universe, which will exploit fundamental \"Baryon\u000d\u000a      Acoustic Oscillations\" research originally performed at Portsmouth.

This amazing discovery has\u000d\u000a      revolutionised physics, leading to the possibility that the Universe is\u000d\u000a      full of a mysterious repulsive substance called \"Dark Energy\" (DE), or\u000d\u000a      that Einstein's great theory of gravity, General Relativity (GR), is\u000d\u000a      incomplete on cosmological scales.\u000d\u000a    Since the discovery of DE, cosmologists have worked hard to improve the\u000d\u000a      measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe. One of the most\u000d\u000a      important new measurement techniques developed to tackle this problem are\u000d\u000a      \"Baryon Acoustic Oscillations\" (BAO); primordial sound waves\u000d\u000a      created in the early Universe that are frozen into the distribution of\u000d\u000a      galaxies as the Universe expands and cools, thus providing a \"standard\u000d\u000a      ruler\" throughout the Universe. The concept of using BAO to measure the\u000d\u000a      expansion rate of the Universe is directly linked to the pioneering work\u000d\u000a      done by Prof. Bob Nichol and Prof. Will Percival as part of the Sloan\u000d\u000a      Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS).\u000d\u000a      While at the ICG, Bob Nichol was part of the research team who made the\u000d\u000a      first robust detection of the BAO signal in the distribution of SDSS\u000d\u000a      galaxies in 2005 [1]. Since then, both Will Percival (at ICG since 2006)\u000d\u000a      and Bob Nichol (at ICG since 2004), have been at the forefront of BAO\u000d\u000a      research improving this technique [2] - including new BAO results [3] -\u000d\u000a      for use in the coming decade to obtain more precise measurements of the\u000d\u000a      accelerated expansion rate of the Universe and better understand the DE\u000d\u000a      that appears to be driving it.\u000d\u000a    Cosmologists now agree that such measurements are best obtained using a\u000d\u000a      combination of techniques, but especially including the BAO technique, as\u000d\u000a      described in the \"Dark Energy Mission Figure of Merit Science Working\u000d\u000a        Group\" report commissioned by NASA &amp; ESA, which includes Bob\u000d\u000a      Nichol as an author [4]. The strategy outlined in this report laid a\u000d\u000a      foundation for new missions like Euclid; a new European Space Agency (ESA)\u000d\u000a      satellite [5] that will be launched in 2020. Euclid is a medium-class\u000d\u000a      mission selected as part of ESA's \"Cosmic Visions 2015-2025\"\u000d\u000a      programme and is specifically designed to exploit a combination of dark\u000d\u000a      energy probes, including the BAO technique, to map the expansion rate of\u000d\u000a      the Universe over 70% the age of the Universe, and over a third of the\u000d\u000a      sky. Such a dark energy measurement is only possible from space.\u000d\u000a    The scientific case for Euclid was built upon key research performed by\u000d\u000a      cosmologists at the ICG and, in collaboration with others, they have\u000d\u000a      helped design key aspects the satellite [5]. Percival and Nichol were\u000d\u000a      instrumental in drafting the official Euclid Science Requirements\u000d\u000a        Document (SciRD), which is the key reference document used by\u000d\u000a      industry and engineers to specify the Euclid mission hardware [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4326","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The ICG undertakes a broad range of outreach activities, which regularly\u000d\u000a      reaches thousands of people per year (4858 in 2012-13; 6424 in 2011-12).\u000d\u000a      In addition, the ICG has invested resources in a dedicated programme of\u000d\u000a      \"high impact\" sustainable events that optimize our public engagement that\u000d\u000a      draws upon our leading cosmological research above, thus ensuring our\u000d\u000a      impact is topical, well-informed and inspiring.\u000d\u000a    The first of these regular (at least annual) events is the ICG ``Cosmology\u000a        Masterclass\" which began in 2010 through a collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Portsmouth Grammar School (PGS) [1]. These one-day events are designed to\u000d\u000a      supplement the A-level national curriculum (specifically the Cosmology\u000d\u000a      module of OCR Physics G485 and the IB Physics Astrophysics option),\u000d\u000a      providing students with an expert view of basic concepts such as the\u000d\u000a      expansion of the Universe (through the Hubble Diagram of supernovae based\u000d\u000a      on ICG-related research [see 5 above]) and different types of galaxies\u000d\u000a      [see 2 above]. Since 2010, we have expanded the reach of the event to\u000d\u000a      include 120 PGS students a year and, since 2012, many local state-run\u000d\u000a      schools: Portsmouth College, South Downs College (2012, 2013), Ryde\u000d\u000a      Academy, Farnborough, Bay House School, Brentside High School, Isle of\u000d\u000a      Wight College, St. John's College, Christ the King Sixth. The feedback\u000d\u000a      from teachers and students has been positive, e.g., 60% of non-PGS\u000d\u000a      students indicated our Masterclass may have increased their interest in a\u000d\u000a      wider range of university courses [1,2]. Furthermore, thirteen students\u000d\u000a      have subsequently joined us for summer Nuffield bursary placements or for\u000d\u000a      work experience, of which four cite their ICG research experience as\u000d\u000a      helping them decide on pursuing a STEM subject at university and aided in\u000d\u000a      their UCAS application [1,3]. The next Masterclass is December 2013.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the PGS, we continue to work with the University Education\u000d\u000a      Liaison and Outreach Team as outlined in our Impact Template (REF3a) to\u000d\u000a      engage school pupils of all ages during campus visits and have provided\u000d\u000a      many one-off school visits upon request, e.g. in 2012-13, ICG researchers\u000d\u000a      engaged with more than 50 different schools across the UK (28 in 2011-12).\u000d\u000a      Since 2011, when we begun collecting detailed demographical information,\u000d\u000a      ICG researchers have reached over 6000 school pupils [4].\u000d\u000a    Since 2006, the ICG has worked with Intech; our local science centre near\u000d\u000a      Winchester, which attracted 140,000 visitors in 2012. Over the last 3\u000d\u000a      years, we have contributed to the Intech \"World Space Week\" [5],\u000d\u000a      including developing hands-on demos about dark matter, components of the\u000d\u000a      Universe (using Lego) and talks about telescopes (all linked to our\u000d\u000a      research). These annual festivals have significant reach engaging\u000d\u000a      thousands of people, typically doubling the normal visitor rate at Intech.\u000d\u000a      A vast majority of our feedback is positive especially for the \"After\u000d\u000a      Dark\" events run by ICG researchers (Dominic Galliano, Tim Clemson) aimed\u000d\u000a      at adult audiences [5,6]. At our last \"World Space Week\" (Oct\u000d\u000a      2013), we reached 716 people, including 634 children.\u000d\u000a    Our final high impact event exploits the national media coverage\u000d\u000a      generated by BBC Stargazing LIVE. Starting in 2011, we ran a small\u000d\u000a      event at Gunwharf Quays (local shopping centre) to allow passing shoppers\u000d\u000a      the opportunity to look through a telescope (in many cases for the first\u000d\u000a      time). In 2012, we expanded the reach of the event to include 25 members\u000d\u000a      of the ICG (coordinated by Karen Masters) to help promote a significant StargazingLIVE\u000d\u000a      event at the Portsmouth Spinnaker Tower. This event was initiated by the\u000d\u000a      BBC and became their flagship event for BBC South. In collaboration with\u000d\u000a      PGS teachers and students and Hampshire Astronomical Society, we provided\u000d\u000a      many activities and demonstrations on all floors of the Spinnaker Tower\u000d\u000a      including astronomicallythemed crafts, \"Science on Tap\", \"Genius Bar\"; all\u000d\u000a      of which drew on our cosmological knowledge. Overall, 450 ticketed guests\u000d\u000a      attend the whole event, with over a hundred passers-by engaging with ICG\u000d\u000a      researchers at the base of the tower. In 2013, we repeated the event, but\u000d\u000a      this time using the HMS Warrior 1860 and the Mary Rose Museum as our venue\u000d\u000a      (also in collaboration with University of Portsmouth Physics Society, HMS\u000d\u000a      Warrior 1860 and Mary Rose Trust education teams and the British Science\u000d\u000a      Association). Again, we had over 450 ticketed guests (limited only by\u000d\u000a      venue size) who experienced a wide range of activities, many of which were\u000d\u000a      directly related to ICG research (e.g. hands-on demonstration of\u000d\u000a      gravitational lensing). The impact was significant and unanimously\u000d\u000a      positive [7] and we are already planning a major StargazingLIVE\u000d\u000a      event for Jan 2014.\u000d\u000a    All our events were covered in the local media thus increasing the reach\u000d\u000a      of the ICG engagement and all venues wish to continue their relationship\u000d\u000a      with the ICG.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (ICG) runs a successful\u000d\u000a      programme of community engagements with local schools, science centres and\u000d\u000a      tourist attractions to influence public awareness and understanding of the\u000d\u000a      world-class research we perform.

Moreover, the Universe also provides\u000d\u000a      a diverse set of physical conditions ideal for testing fundamental laws of\u000d\u000a      physics, while also having a profound impact on the engagement of science\u000d\u000a      by the public, by addressing philosophical questions like the origin of\u000d\u000a      the Universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.\u000d\u000a    Over the same period, the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (ICG)\u000d\u000a      has grown to become a centre of research excellence in astrophysics and\u000d\u000a      cosmology. Building on the success of RAE2008, where 75% of the ICG\u000d\u000a      research was judged to be \"internationally excellent\" or better (ranked in\u000d\u000a      the top six departments in the Applied Mathematics UoA), we have broadened\u000d\u000a      and strengthened our research base to include a deeper involvement in\u000d\u000a      large international cosmological experiments and study the details of how\u000d\u000a      galaxies have evolved over the lifetime of the Cosmos. This growing body\u000d\u000a      of underpinning research has been vital to inform our high impact public\u000d\u000a      engagement by ICG staff.\u000d\u000a    In addition to our high productivity in publishing high impact research\u000d\u000a      papers, ICG staff also hold prestigious leadership roles in several\u000d\u000a      international collaborations that are helping to shape the present\u000d\u000a      cosmological paradigm, e.g., David Bacon is joint lead of the LOFAR\u000d\u000a      Surveys Cosmology Working Group, Claudia Maraston is chair of the Sloan\u000d\u000a      Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) BOSS Galaxy Evolution Working Group\u000d\u000a      (WG), Rita Torejio is co-chair of the SDSS-III BOSS Large Scale Structure\u000d\u000a      WG. Furthermore, Bob Nichol, Will Percival and Daniel Thomas are chairs of\u000d\u000a      the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Supernova, LSS and Galaxy Evolution WGs\u000d\u000a      respectively. Involvement in such key cosmological experiments ensures\u000d\u000a      that our public engagement activities are topical, showing a clear\u000d\u000a      connection between the physics of the Universe and how we test that\u000d\u000a      physics.\u000d\u000a    Our team has received several prestigious awards over recent years\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the quality of our staff and their ability to communicate\u000d\u000a      their passion for cosmology. For example, Tasinato presently holds a STFC\u000d\u000a      Advanced Fellow, while David Bacon was an RCUK fellow until 2012. Percival\u000d\u000a      and Koyama have both won ERC Starting Grants (2008-13) as well as the\u000d\u000a      Philip Leverhulme prize.

David Wands\u000d\u000a      was awarded the Daiwa-Adrian Prize in 2010 for his international\u000d\u000a      collaborative cosmology work. Claudia Maraston held a Marie Curie\u000d\u000a      Excellence Team Grant for 2007-11.

Each assignment typically takes several weeks or months to\u000d\u000a      complete, and commonly requires some degree of effort to configure the\u000d\u000a      software, monitor progress or restart a run. The successful completion of\u000d\u000a      over 130 million model years (January 2013) thus indicates a significant\u000d\u000a      commitment of time and effort by individual users. The number of active\u000d\u000a      participants, defined as having contributed effort within the previous\u000d\u000a      month, is therefore considerably smaller than the total of 260,000\u000d\u000a      registered users and in May 2012 it numbered approximately 20,000.\u000d\u000a    The project's message boards, maintained by volunteer moderators, helped\u000d\u000a      newcomers join the project and resolved issues with running the software\u000d\u000a      and 238 discussion threads were active during the 12 months to May 2012.\u000d\u000a      Many discussions on these boards were centred around the results from\u000d\u000a      participants' individual models, and were stimulated by users being able\u000d\u000a      to investigate how his or her particular simulation was progressing using\u000d\u000a      a graphics package from the project.\u000d\u000a    Global reach and value of donated CPU time\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, over 100,000 users have joined; over 40,000 distinct users\u000d\u000a      have successfully completed one or more model simulations; and of the\u000d\u000a      total computational cycles in the project, all effectively donated by\u000d\u000a      users, over 60% have been performed since that date. A snapshot of\u000d\u000a      activity was taken in May 2012 [A]. At that time, the 20,000 active users\u000d\u000a      contributed approximately 27,000 active host PCs, with a combined power of\u000d\u000a      35 TFlops. Of the 82 BOINC projects, climateprediction.net was the\u000d\u000a      4th most popular by work-units in progress and 5th\u000d\u000a      in attracting new users. Registered users were located in 221 countries.\u000d\u000a      Although the project has been running since Sept 2003, 9 of the 10 busiest\u000d\u000a      days have been since Jan 2008 and in May 2012 around 30- 40 new users\u000d\u000a      joined each day.\u000d\u000a    The computing time required for all the model simulations run\u000d\u000a      successfully since 2008 is equivalent to a 32,220 core machine running\u000d\u000a      full time for one year and producing 100% successful results: the value of\u000d\u000a      this CPU time has been estimated as $22.5M, based on the rate of the\u000d\u000a      Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Standard Spot Instance ($0.08\/hour in 2012).\u000d\u000a    Significance to participants\u000d\u000a    Volunteers participating in the project benefitted through increased\u000d\u000a      understanding of and interest in climate science, and higher levels of\u000d\u000a      engagement with science more widely. A survey in 2013 gathered responses\u000d\u000a      from 127 participants, only 3 of whom had never run the model themselves\u000d\u000a      while 82 ran it daily [B]. Of those that answered detailed questions, 78%\u000d\u000a      would feel confident describing how it worked to a friend, 59% had\u000d\u000a      recommended it to friends and 46% had contributed to help or climate\u000d\u000a      discussion boards. Of 57 identifying a favourite aspect, 38% cited the\u000d\u000a      contribution they were making and 31% mentioned climate. One explained, \"Hearing\u000a        about results was rewarding, the project also increased my knowledge of\u000d\u000a        climate change as well as encouraged me to study it more in depth at my\u000d\u000a        university.\"\u000d\u000a    As a result of taking part, respondents reported having\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      developed understanding of climate science (75%) and how research is\u000d\u000a        carried out (59%)\u000d\u000a      considered climate science to be more interesting (80%) and\/or more\u000d\u000a        important (73%)\u000d\u000a      changed their behaviour to address climate change (44%)\u000d\u000a      read further information or educational resources on climate science\u000d\u000a        (67%)\u000d\u000a      read or watched more media coverage of science (55%)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Only 35% of respondents had a degree in physics and approximately half\u000d\u000a      were aged over 50.\u000d\u000a    Recognition and development of volunteer computing\u000d\u000a    The project has also contributed to wider adoption and recognition of the\u000d\u000a      `citizen science' methodology and, for example, was cited in 2010 as one\u000d\u000a      of several exemplars in The Telegraph, where Roger Highfield\u000d\u000a      wrote, \"But what is breathtaking is the scale of what is now possible.\"\u000d\u000a      [C]. The methodology for assembling the very large dataset proved\u000d\u000a      sufficiently robust for acceptance by Nature Geoscience [5]: even\u000d\u000a      disregarding the outcome for research, this demonstrates the effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of the approach to a formidable computational task. The project has also\u000d\u000a      stimulated discussions about its own carbon footprint [D]. The impact of\u000d\u000a      the BOINC platform, now enabling an average of over 7 PetaFLOPS of\u000d\u000a      volunteer computing, is also reliant in part on developments in security\u000d\u000a      made for climateprediction.net and team member Tolu Aina was\u000d\u000a      acknowledged by BOINC as an external (`volunteer') developer [E]. The\u000d\u000a      project was shortlisted in 2012 for a Guardian University Award\u000d\u000a      for Outstanding Research Impact [F].\u000d\u000a    Education and dissemination\u000d\u000a    The climateeducation.net programme has delivered two online\u000d\u000a      courses in climate science, which drew on the concepts and methodology of\u000d\u000a      the project, in a collaboration between the University of Oxford's climateprediction.net\u000a      team, its Department for Continuing Education, and the UK Met Office\u000d\u000a      Hadley Centre's PRECIS team.

That year, Myles Allen joined\u000d\u000a      the Climate Dynamics group in the Department of Physics at Oxford and in\u000d\u000a      2001, together with Oxford research assistant David Stainforth and\u000d\u000a      external collaborators, developed the design and first implementation of\u000d\u000a      his concept of a robust ensemble of climate models that would use public\u000d\u000a      participation to obtain the necessary computing power. In 2002 they set\u000d\u000a      out the formal methodology of this approach and its advantages over\u000d\u000a      conventional methods [1]. The crucial advance was that the parameters\u000d\u000a      of the model would be varied, not only the initial conditions, and then\u000d\u000a      that a constrained ensemble of models could be formed by weighting the\u000d\u000a      parameter sets by the agreement of each set of results with recent climate\u000d\u000a      observations. This was in contrast to a conventional `expert judgement' to\u000d\u000a      choose the parameters with which forecasts would be made.\u000d\u000a    Allen and Stainforth's practical implementation of this idea took the\u000d\u000a      form of a parameter perturbation analysis of a standard climate model (the\u000d\u000a      HadCM3 model developed in the 1990s by the Met Office, still one of the\u000d\u000a      most realistic global atmosphere-ocean models available), in which each\u000d\u000a      member of a Monte Carlo ensemble was run on a personal computer\u000d\u000a      volunteered by the general public. In 2002, Allen was awarded NERC funding\u000d\u000a      for the climateprediction.net project, to use this `citizen\u000d\u000a      science' approach to obtain the world's first probabilistic forecast of\u000d\u000a      anthropogenic climate change. Core partners in the project were the\u000d\u000a      University of Oxford (Physics and eResearch Centre), the Rutherford\u000d\u000a      Appleton Laboratory, The Open University and the UK Meteorological Office.\u000d\u000a      Since 2004, the project has used software from the Berkeley Open\u000d\u000a      Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC), to which climateprediction.net\u000a      members in the Oxford eResearch Centre made significant contributions.\u000d\u000a    The initial experiment was launched in September 2003 [2], exploring the\u000d\u000a      equilibrium response to doubling carbon dioxide levels in a model with a\u000d\u000a      realistic atmosphere but idealised representation of the ocean, applied to\u000d\u000a      the years 1950 to 2050. The hypothesis that sufficient simulations would\u000d\u000a      be performed through this experiment proved correct and the results were\u000d\u000a      published in 2005 [3,4]. The experiment showed a strong asymmetry in the\u000d\u000a      response of the \"climate sensitivity\" (equilibrium warming response to\u000d\u000a      doubling carbon dioxide) to plausible perturbations of parameters.\u000d\u000a      Increases in sensitivity tended to be much larger than the reductions,\u000d\u000a      leading to a risk that the temperature rise would prove to be\u000d\u000a      substantially higher than the 1.5 - 4.5&#176;C range in widespread use at that\u000d\u000a      time.\u000d\u000a    In 2006, the project released a significantly more sophisticated\u000d\u000a      experiment, using both a fully dynamic\/interactive ocean model and a\u000d\u000a      time-varying (transient) forcing scenario. It accumulated the first\u000d\u000a      multi-thousand member ensemble of simulations using a complex coupled\u000d\u000a      atmosphere- ocean climate model and addressed some of the uncertainties\u000d\u000a      that previous forecasts may have overlooked. Results were similar to the\u000d\u000a      earlier experiment in that, relative to other ensembles (notably CMIP-3),\u000d\u000a      they indicated a similar low end to the distribution of projected warming,\u000d\u000a      but a somewhat higher upper end that could not be ruled out by arguments\u000d\u000a      that models were not a good fit to observations. They suggested that a\u000d\u000a      global warming of 3&#176;C by 2050, relative to the 1961- 1990 average, was as\u000d\u000a      plausible as a rise of 1.4&#176;C [5]. This range was derived from the set of\u000d\u000a      simulations that accurately reproduced observed temperature changes over\u000d\u000a      the last 50 years. They implied that the world is very likely to cross the\u000d\u000a      '2 degrees barrier' at some point this century if emissions continue\u000d\u000a      unabated, and that warming of up to 3 degrees by 2050 is possible even on\u000d\u000a      a mid-range emission scenario. This was a faster rate of warming than most\u000d\u000a      other models predicted.\u000d\u000a    Myles Allen joined Oxford as a NERC Advanced Fellow (2000-03), took up a\u000d\u000a      Lectureship (2003- 11) and is now Professor of Geosystem Science\u000d\u000a      (2011-present).

Affordable global uptake of solar\u000d\u000a      energy requires a significant reduction in materials and manufacturing\u000d\u000a      costs and must therefore be based on abundant materials. The high material\u000d\u000a      cost of crystalline silicon cells has resulted in the search for\u000d\u000a      alternative low cost solutions such as thin film solar cell technology.\u000d\u000a      However thin film solar cells that are currently available use scarce\u000d\u000a      elements in their construction, for example indium and tellurium.\u000d\u000a      Conventional liquid electrolytes are also volatile, corrosive and\u000d\u000a      difficult to seal and hence severely limit the overall performance and\u000d\u000a      feasibility.\u000d\u000a    Oxford PV has developed 3rd generation technology using\u000d\u000a      Snaith's research to make solar cells from cheap and abundant materials\u000d\u000a      that are fabricated using simple screen-printing techniques. Replacing\u000d\u000a      liquid electrolytes with solid-state hole conductors improves the\u000d\u000a      performance. The efficiency of lab-based cells is over 15% (world-leading\u000d\u000a      for its class) and the manufacturing costs are estimated at 30% of the\u000d\u000a      current lowest cost of thin film technologies.\u000d\u000a    Oxford PV targets the Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) sector and\u000d\u000a      its business model is to have their solar cells printed onto windows that\u000d\u000a      are integrated into office buildings.

Snaith was able to\u000d\u000a      enhance the photocurrent generation further by including metallic\u000d\u000a      nanoparticles to act as plasmonic light-harvesting antennae [2].\u000d\u000a    Stability of SDSCs\u000d\u000a    A further issue for SDSCs was that although in principle they should be\u000d\u000a      much more stable than electrolyte based DSCs, it had been found that they\u000d\u000a      required the presence of oxygen to prevent a short-circuiting path\u000d\u000a      developing in the device. Snaith identified the degradation of the oxide\u000d\u000a      insulators as the cause and showed that adding a mesoporous layer of\u000d\u000a      aluminium oxide solved this problem, enabling solid-state dye-sensitized\u000d\u000a      solar cells to be produced [3].\u000d\u000a    Mesoporous single crystals\u000d\u000a    In 2013 Snaith's team developed a method for growing mesoporous single\u000d\u000a      crystals without the need for high temperature sintering, thus opening up\u000d\u000a      a route for reducing the production costs and the possibility of using\u000d\u000a      flexible substrates. Using these structures with a conventional dye gave\u000d\u000a      efficiencies of 3%, and replacing the dye with a perovskite gave\u000d\u000a      efficiencies over 7% [4]. Further improvements to the charge collection in\u000d\u000a      the cells have now given rise to cells with efficiencies of up to 15%,\u000d\u000a      which is approaching that of conventional silicon cells.\u000d\u000a    In 2012, Snaith won the Institute of Physics Paterson medal and prize\u000d\u000a      \"for his important contributions to the field of excitonic solar cells.\"\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5792","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research by Telle and co-workers at the ALSU on laser\u000d\u000a      technologies has had substantial impacts on industry.

Based on the research in [R3], a &#163;100k\u000d\u000a      system [G2, G3] was designed by ALSU to allow uninterrupted\u000d\u000a      operation of power stations during assaying, thus avoiding the need for a\u000d\u000a      reactor shutdown for significant periods of time. This saved &#163;4m per day,\u000d\u000a      based on the power stations' wattage output and the cost of commercial\u000d\u000a      electricity in kWhr.\u000d\u000a    In order to provide LIBS analytic services to the nuclear industry on a\u000d\u000a      larger scale, a spin-off company, Applied Photonics Ltd, was\u000d\u000a      established in 1998 by Dr A.I. Whitehouse, a former PhD student at ALSU.\u000d\u000a      The company operated in collaboration with Telle and his team and has utilised\u000a        the research described in [R2-R6]. Applied Photonics has now\u000d\u000a      developed into a major provider of LIBS services and manufacturer of LIBS\u000d\u000a      equipment. It is based in North Yorkshire and currently employs around 20\u000d\u000a      staff (in the UK and the USA) &#8212; recently it entered into a strategic\u000d\u000a      partnership with Energy Research Company (ERCo), Staten Island, NY.\u000d\u000a    Applied Photonics has an extensive product portfolio ranging from\u000d\u000a      hand-held devices that allow easy characterisation of samples to bespoke,\u000d\u000a      submersible LIBS probe systems that perform in situ analysis of\u000d\u000a      materials within spent-fuel storage ponds for the UK nuclear industry.\u000d\u000a      The economic impact of this LIBS technology is measured by the\u000d\u000a      multi-million pound savings enabled by avoiding the shutdown of nuclear\u000d\u000a      power stations, thanks to the use of Applied Photonics' remote, robotic\u000d\u000a      assaying devices.

Around two-thirds of Applied Photonics' current\u000d\u000a      business is now with the US military and nuclear industry, and\u000d\u000a      while the system developed in 2009 is in the public domain [C2], more\u000d\u000a      recent advances are subject to confidentiality.\u000d\u000a    Analysis of nuclear and chemical explosive material for the Atomic\u000d\u000a        Weapons Establishment\u000d\u000a    The AWE entered a research collaboration with the ALSU in\u000d\u000a      1993 to determine the isotopic abundances in uranium samples by performing\u000d\u000a      RIMS on the final products in the decay chain (lead) [R1]. As a\u000d\u000a      proof-of-concept, uranium specimens were analysed in-house by ALSU\u000d\u000a      [C3].

Such techniques include:\u000d\u000a    Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) [R2-R6]\u000d\u000a    In LIBS, a high-power laser is shot at a sample, generating a\u000d\u000a      micro-plasma whose spectrum is analysed to yield information about the\u000d\u000a      sample's chemical composition. Telle's group began developing LIBS in\u000d\u000a      1995, with an emphasis on achieving remote implementations via a single\u000d\u000a      optical fibre and the ability to probe samples in underwater environments.\u000d\u000a      Telle and colleagues addressed and solved these issues in [R2-R6, G2, G3].\u000d\u000a      This research has also been applied to strip insulators from critical\u000d\u000a      safety components in the aerospace industry by laser-induced plasma\u000d\u000a      ablation.\u000d\u000a    Resonance Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (RIMS) [R1]\u000d\u000a    RIMS was developed at the ALSU under Telle's leadership [R1], during the\u000d\u000a      period 1990-1998, and led to a DTI\/SERC programme and the involvement of\u000d\u000a      industrial partners [G1]. In RIMS, a small plume of the sample is created\u000d\u000a      by either a high-power laser or ion-beam bombardment; a laser is then\u000d\u000a      tuned to a resonant transition of the particular isotope being analysed; a\u000d\u000a      further photon ionises the atoms in the plume which are then analysed in a\u000d\u000a      mass spectrometer. RIMS builds on and complements Secondary Ion Mass\u000d\u000a      Spectrometry, which is a widely used analytical technique. The advantage\u000d\u000a      compared to other analysis techniques is that only the element of interest\u000d\u000a      is ionised; this facilitates the accurate measurement of isotope\u000d\u000a      abundances which may be otherwise difficult to detect due to the presence\u000d\u000a      of interference by other constituents. Telle's work illustrated the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of RIMS in isotope measurements in the decay chain of\u000d\u000a      uranium [R1].\u000d\u000a    Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy (TDLAS) [C1]\u000d\u000a    Telle also developed table-top TDLAS systems to analyse trace quantities\u000d\u000a      of gases in 2002. TDLAS was quickly exploited by AWE who commissioned\u000d\u000a      further research [G4] which demonstrated its ability to analyse gases\u000d\u000a      emitted from chemical explosives as they deteriotated. Much of this work\u000d\u000a      is confidential and the contract prohibits publication, but it has led to\u000d\u000a      reports [C1].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5793","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Recent discoveries in fundamental physics have resonated with the\u000a      public's imagination and the world's media and offered a perfect platform\u000a      to engage, enthuse and educate both the young and not-so-young\u000a      with science. Our UoA grasped the opportunity given by this media\u000a      attention to develop a systematic programme of public engagement, centred\u000a      on our antimatter research.\u000a    The trapping and storing of antihydrogen (November 2010) produced extensive\u000a        global media interest; many TV channels, such as the BBC [C1] and\u000a      CNN featured the story in their news bulletins, articles appeared in over\u000a      100 newspapers in 25 countries in 15 languages [C2] as well as in all of\u000a      the UK's national broadsheets [C3], and a Guardian profile of Charlton was\u000a      published in 2009 [C4]. UoA researchers regularly appeared in the media\u000a      continuing our group's public engagement by describing our research [C5].\u000a    As well as articles on ALPHA in the popular press, the results have also\u000a      been featured in scientific magazines and websites that are read\u000a      by the public as well as researchers, such as Nature [C6], Scientific\u000a      American [C7], Physics World [C8] and New Scientist [C9]. Other accounts\u000a      have appeared in RCUK articles [C10] and in the Times Higher Education\u000a      Supplement [C11]. Charlton and colleagues wrote educational articles [C12]\u000a      and gave public lectures at Science Festivals including Cheltenham\u000a      in 2013 [C13].\u000a    We have hosted two annual events for high school students for a number of\u000a      years: Particle Physics Masterclasses [C14] and Schools\u000a        Lectures designed to inspire young people to study physics. Both\u000a      these events are heavily over-subscribed: 2,500 students have attended our\u000a      Schools Lectures since 2008 and last year, there were over 150 students\u000a      registered for the Masterclasses. As a result of this demand, we have\u000a      doubled the number of Schools Lectures and trebled the number of\u000a      Masterclass events we hold each year.\u000a    Having established this foundation in our engagement work with school\u000a      students, we broadened and refined our events by creating a virtual\u000a        ALPHA experiment \"Hands on Antihydrogen\". This bespoke\u000a      software was written by a programmer employed within the UoA by an EPSRC\u000a      \"Pathways to Impact\" grant totalling &#163;39k [C15]. It is analogous to the\u000a      Atlantis event display software developed by the LHC's ATLAS\u000a      collaboration, but is interactive rather than static. The user injects\u000a      positrons, antiprotons and electrons and manipulates the electromagnetic\u000a      trap parameters in order to confine and then cool the particles before\u000a      antihydrogen can be produced, recreating virtually the actual CERN\u000a      experiment.\u000a    Using questionnaires, we measured the impact of using this\u000a      software and the associated antimatter lectures on the students'\u000a      understanding. The statistics show that, as a result of our antimatter\u000a      Masterclasses, the students' knowledge of antimatter increased by 150%,\u000a      there was a 50% increase in the number who understood both the relevance\u000a      of antimatter and where it is produced, and a significant increase in the\u000a      number who understood its interactions.\u000a    In 2012, we exhibited our antihydrogen work at the National Eisteddfod\u000a      aided by an STFC \"Science in Society\" grant [C16]. Our presentation\u000a      attracted 26,000 visitors to the Science Pavilion, and was broadcast on\u000a      the Welsh language TV channel S4C. A centrepiece of the Physics\u000a      stand was a large, bilingual (English and Welsh) exhibition board,\u000a      summarising the ALPHA antihydrogen experiment staffed by bilingual\u000a      presenters from our UoA. In addition we presented our antihydrogen\u000a      research at the Urdd (Youth) Eisteddfod each year from 2011, with an\u000a      average attendance of 14,000 in the GwyddonLe (Science Tent) [C17].\u000a    Outreach is a core activity at CERN. The antimatter facility is open for\u000a      weekly public tours regularly led by our UoA's Madsen who is an\u000a      official Antiproton Decelerator guide, and the content of the tours draws\u000a      directly on the research described above. The impact of these visits to\u000a      the antimatter hall (several thousands per year) is clear from the\u000a      emails and letters sent to CERN [C18]. These include those from students\u000a      stating that as a result of the visit they want to study physics and come\u000a      back to CERN, for example: \"so many thanks for a brilliant, amazing,\u000a        inspiring day\" - School pupil visitor.\u000a    ALPHA has access to CERN's media unit, and educational videos about the\u000a      antihydrogen experiment have been produced for CERN's YouTube\u000a      channel [C19] receiving over 100,000 hits. We also produced a\u000a      special CERN interactive webcast on antimatter in November 2012\u000a      [C20] which had a record number of viewers [C18], and the ALPHA website in\u000a      CERN received 10,000 hits in 2012 [C21].\u000a    The plot of the 2009 film Angels and Demons (which grossed\u000a      $500m) exploits the CERN antihydrogen project and is based on the\u000a      best-selling 2001 novel of the same name [C22]. The film and book credit\u000a      CERN and the book acknowledges the Antiproton Decelerator and CERN's \"advanced\u000a        antimatter production facility\" on page 9. Although the plot centres\u000a      on the creation and storage of antimatter in CERN, it contains a number of\u000a      scientific gaffes. An associated book Secrets of Angels and Demons\u000a      [C23] correctly explains the science behind the actual CERN research and\u000a      contains extensive coverage of ATHENA. CERN also maintains a website for\u000a      members of the public curious about the facts behind the Angels and\u000a        Demons fiction [C24].\u000a    Summary: Swansea's antimatter research has achieved significant impact\u000a        through public engagement building on our world-leading research in\u000a      CERN. This has accomplished:\u000a    Reach: Global media interest; scientific magazine articles;\u000a      Science Festival lectures; Angels and Demons; CERN public tours;\u000a      YouTube educational videos and webcasts.\u000a    Significance: Masterclasses; school lectures; improved public\u000a      understanding of science; software for a virtual antihydrogen experiment;\u000a      Welsh language exposure.\u000a    As a result the public perception and understanding of antimatter\u000a      has moved from the stuff of science fiction and Star Trek to real science\u000a      and actual experiments in CERN.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In public perception, antimatter used to be associated with science\u000a      fiction, but the creation and trapping of antihydrogen at CERN by\u000a      the ATHENA and ALPHA Collaborations has sparked world-wide media\u000a        interest in the real science of antimatter. Building on this, we\u000a      started a campaign of public dissemination and education to promote and\u000a      explain our work through media interviews, popular articles, and public\u000a      lectures including a Welsh language component. We developed software\u000a        simulators that have been used by school pupils in Masterclasses\u000a      to re- create virtually CERN's antihydrogen production. YouTube clips and\u000a      webcasts with over 100,000 hits have been produced and we have\u000a      hosted thousands of visitors per year in CERN. These activities\u000a      resulted in improved understanding of antimatter among school students and\u000a      the wider population, and a radical change in the public perception of\u000a      antimatter, which is now associated with the experiments at CERN rather\u000a      than with Star Trek.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Swansea University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Swansea University","InstitutionName":"Swansea University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007855}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Publications (R1, R2, and R4 best represent the quality of the\u000a        research.)\u000a    \u000a[R1] M.

These research milestones have been published in\u000a      Nature (2002, 2010 and 2012) and in Nature Physics (2011) (see [R1-R4]\u000a      below), with supporting publications in other leading physics journals\u000a      such as Physical Review Letters and Physics Letters B. The capture of\u000a      small quantities of atomic antimatter in a neutral atom trap has opened up\u000a      the new field of antimatter spectroscopy and we have been deeply involved\u000a      in the first experiment of this type ever to be performed as well as the\u000a      earlier preparatory phases, as summarised in [R5].\u000a    The Swansea Atomic, Molecular and Quantum Physics group, led by Prof\u000a      Charlton (at Swansea since 1999) and including Bertsche (Swansea\u000a      2007-2011), Madsen (since 2005) and van der Werf (since 1999), has played\u000a      a leading role in this antihydrogen research. We have the largest\u000a        representation of any institution in CERN's antihydrogen\u000a      experiments, and the Swansea authorship out-numbers any other\u000a        institution's in the main underpinning references [R1-R4]. The first\u000a      production of cold antihydrogen (ATHENA, see [R1]) was achieved by\u000a      injecting antiprotons with a few electron-volts of kinetic energy into a\u000a      positron cloud. Though antihydrogen atoms were copiously formed, detailed\u000a      work indicated that they had retained some of the injection energy and\u000a      were too hot to trap.\u000a    An intense development period followed in which a new apparatus was\u000a      developed by ALPHA which incorporated a neutral atom trap superimposed\u000a      upon the charged particle traps for the positrons and antiprotons. Colder\u000a      antiparticle plasmas combined with a new antiproton injection scheme based\u000a      upon autoresonant excitation allowed some of the very coldest antihydrogen\u000a      atoms to be trapped [R2]. The cryogenic environment inside the apparatus\u000a      meant that the gas pressure was extremely low, and we were able to\u000a      demonstrate storage of antihydrogen for over 15 minutes [R3]. This allowed\u000a      us to insert microwaves into the apparatus to promote resonant interaction\u000a      with the trapped anti-atoms [R4], the first ever spectroscopy of an\u000a        antimatter atom.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5794","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Simulations using High Performance Computers (HPC) are\u000a      established as the third mode of scientific investigation after experiment\u000a      and theory and it is inevitable that their impact will grow. HPC systems\u000a      are best viewed as tightly interconnected collections of individual\u000a      computers. Therefore, two main factors affect their overall performance:\u000a      the individual CPU power and the communication throughput\u000a      between these CPUs. Understanding both aspects is crucial for designing,\u000a      developing and testing HPC platforms.\u000a    In order to rank the performance of HPC machines, benchmarking software\u000a      is used. By far the most popular is Linpack which is the only\u000a      performance tool used in the universally accepted list of the world's\u000a      fastest computers, www.top500.org.\u000a      However, Linpack measures only computational speed (via dense matrix\u000a      multiplications) and it \"does not stress local bandwidth\" and \"does\u000a        not stress the network\" according to Jack Dongarra, who first\u000a      introduced this benchmark in the 1970's. Thom Dunning, director of the\u000a      National Center for Supercomputing Applications (University of Illinois at\u000a      Urbana-Champaign), agrees with this sentiment: \"almost anyone who\u000a          knows about it will deride its utility\".\u000a    The unique property of our BSMBench code - the capacity to vary\u000a        computational and communication aspects simply by adjusting the\u000a      physical parameters of the theories it simulates - makes it an exemplary\u000a      alternative benchmark tool. In 2011, Lucini realised the important impact\u000a      that his software would have in the design and appraisal of HPC and\u000a      therefore began packaging the code into a benchmark tool, BSMBench.\u000a      He utilised his IBM contacts to initiate a formal collaboration with\u000a        IBM to implement this work. This project was finalised by the internship\u000a        of Swansea PhD student, Ed Bennett, in the IBM Research Center\u000a      in Cambridge (MA) (from 25\/6\/11 to 17\/8\/11) formalised under a Joint Study\u000a      Agreement between Swansea University and IBM [C1]. Lucini had overall\u000a      design lead of the benchmark tool and remains the maintainer of the code.\u000a      This project resulted in a conference presentation, co-authored by Lucini\u000a      and Dr Kirk Jordan of IBM Research at the industrial-facing\u000a      International Supercomputing Conference, ISC12 [C2]. As a result of this commercial\u000a        collaboration, BSMBench was released as an open source project\u000a      in June 2012, and can be downloaded free of charge from www.bsmbench.org.\u000a      The code has been designed to run easily on a variety of systems, from\u000a      small symmetric multi-processor machines to the most powerful\u000a      supercomputers and it has been tested on systems from 64 to 8192 cores\u000a      with no degradation in performance.\u000a    IBM has been using BSMBench since August 2011 to inform the design\u000a      of its supercomputers and to promote their cutting-edge BlueGene\/Q\u000a      systems. These are currently some of the planet's most powerful HPC\u000a      architectures: they occupy four of the top ten places in the June 2013\u000a      world ranking (www.top500.org). The\u000a      BSMBench product has had significant impact on IBM and,\u000a      importantly, helped track some errors in their multi-million dollar\u000a        BlueGene\/Q systems. From the IBM HPC Associate Program Director\u000a      [C3]:\u000a    I write to acknowledge the impact that BSMBench, the benchmarking tool\u000a        derived from your research on Strongly Interacting Dynamics beyond the\u000a        Standard Model, has had on the evaluation of our BlueGene\/Q\u000a        architecture. While the www.top500.org\u000a      ranking of these systems is based on the Linpack benchmarking tool, the\u000a      capabilities of our architecture were confirmed by the more\u000a          stringent BSMBench tests. BSMBench establishes a new\u000a        concept in benchmarking High Performance Computing systems. We\u000a          have used it to test our recent IBM BlueGene\/Q systems prior to their\u000a          commercialization through the work Ed Bennett did, and we\u000a        have found the results very informative helping to identify some issues\u000a        with the compiler and support software.\u000a    BSMBench is being developed and commercialised by BSMbench Ltd, a\u000a      start-up company founded in 2012 specifically created to promote,\u000a      market, and utilise the BSMBench code suite. Lucini was a founder and is\u000a      Chief Technical Officer and a shareholder. This company has won significant\u000a        EU convergence funding worth &#163;180k to advance and refine the\u000a      software [C4]. Currently, it is developing general-purpose parallel\u000a      software based on BSMBench that can be used in HPC applications in sectors\u000a      such as finance, aerospace engineering, weather forecasting and oil\u000a      extraction. BSMbench has recorded downloads of its software from companies\u000a      such as Fujitsu, Research in Motion (Blackberry), Jaguar Land Rover,\u000a        KLM and Microsoft [C5]. From the BSMbench Company Director [C5]:\u000a    \"this tool has been a crucial enabler for us and it is thanks to it\u000a        and to its open source nature that we were able to set up our business,\u000a        BSMbench Ltd. Basing its activity on BSMBench and on further\u000a        developments of it, our company is constantly growing its business and\u000a        attracting a larger base of customers.\"\u000a    Since the summer of 2012, HPC Wales - a &#163;40m national computing\u000a      centre - has used BSMBench to benchmark and monitor the performance of its\u000a      systems [C6]. In April 2013, BSMBench was used by Fujitsu (a major\u000a      IT systems company with annual turnover of &#163;1.8bn) to validate and\u000a      benchmark their computers at HPC Wales's latest Hub prior to its launch\u000a      [C7]. BSMBench has also been used by Transtec, a European HPC\u000a      company with annual revenues of &#8364;45m, to benchmark their latest commercial\u000a      products [C8]. Furthermore, Lucini was asked to perform monitoring of Fujitsu's\u000a        Sandybridge clusters using BSMBench [C9]. The Chief Executive of HPC\u000a      Wales said [C6]:\u000a    \"BSMBench has been used extensively on our systems, to monitor their\u000a        performance and detect potential problems at an early stage. In all our\u000a        applications, BSMBench has proved to be robust and reliable, and has\u000a        been an invaluable asset to enable us to provide a high standard of\u000a        service to our customers.\"\u000a    The software has attracted the interest of the Open Source community.\u000a      An article reviewing its features and describing its use in an industrial\u000a      environment was published in Linux Format,\u000a      the UK's best selling Linux magazine with a monthly circulation of 24,000\u000a      [C10], and in issue 124 of the Italian magazine Linux Pro [C11].\u000a      From the editor of Linux Format [C10]:\u000a    \"I write to acknowledge the impact that BSMBench has had for our\u000a        company.

Following this guideline, a 4-page tutorial on\u000a        using BSMBench was included in Linux Format issue 163 and the software\u000a        package itself was part of the bonus DVD in issue 164.

It comprehensively informs the design and testing of new\u000a      computing architectures well beyond other benchmarking tools on\u000a      the market, such as Linpack.\u000a    The significance of our code is that, unlike other benchmarking tools,\u000a      it interpolates from a communication- to a computation-dominated\u000a      regime simply by varying the (physics) parameters in the code, thus\u000a      providing a perfect benchmark suite to test the response of modern\u000a      multi-CPU systems along this axis.

However it is incomplete because, e.g. it does not include\u000a      gravity and there are issues surrounding the stability of the Higgs mass.\u000a      Obtaining a more complete theory which answers these questions is a Grand\u000a        Challenge problem. The tool described in this case study was born\u000a      from Prof Lucini's research in `walking technicolor' BSM models\u000a      which seek to explain electroweak symmetry breaking via a composite Higgs.\u000a      Due to these theories' properties, progress can only be made using numerical\u000a        simulations. This follows the same approach used to study the\u000a      interaction of quarks via the strong force in which physicists have 30\u000a      years of computing experience.\u000a    Lucini initiated this research soon after his appointment to\u000a      Swansea in October 2005. He and his group are still actively pursuing this\u000a      programme and they are recognised as world-leaders in this field.\u000a      The impact in this case study is based on research from March 2008\u000a      [R1-R5]. These papers identified the first numerical signatures validating\u000a      technicolor as a potential mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking.\u000a    In order to simulate the wide range of parameters of the putative\u000a      technicolor theories, a parallel, scalable and efficient simulation code\u000a      is needed, but such a code was not available in 2008. Lucini therefore\u000a      developed a suitable code, written so that the physical parameters\u000a      representing different realisations of technicolor (essentially the number\u000a      and representations of the \"quarks\" and \"gluons\" in each theory) could be\u000a      freely adjusted as input parameters. This was very challenging\u000a      conceptually and technically since varying these parameters leads to very\u000a      different algebraic structures and hence different coding frameworks.\u000a    The performance of modern supercomputers depends on both the raw computational\u000a        power of each processing unit and the communication speed\u000a      between them. The communication component is crucially important since all\u000a      supercomputers rely on linking many (typically hundreds of thousands of)\u000a      CPUs to obtain the maximum possible overall speed. The balance between\u000a      these two parameters is a crucial factor in supercomputer design and\u000a      testing.\u000a    The key ingredient of Lucini's BSM code which led to this research's\u000a      impact is that the user can easily adjust the physics parameters\u000a      corresponding to the choice of the technicolor theory being simulated.\u000a      However, due to the ingenious way the software is written, this causes\u000a      fundamental changes deep in the code which independently stress the\u000a        communication and computational aspects of the computer system.\u000a    Lucini's leadership in this research programme was recognised by the\u000a      award of a Royal Society University Research Fellowship [G1,G2],\u000a      an EPSRC software grant [G3] and an STFC Special Progamme\u000a        Grant [G4] which funded a PDRA. Swansea University, recognising the\u000a      potential impact of this work, granted Lucini sabbatical leave to develop\u000a      this research programme. Other contributors to this project included the\u000a      Swansea PDRAs Drs.

The adoption of laser\u000d\u000a      cleaning, which avoids the need to use these substances, in the\u000d\u000a      conservation process has therefore been of benefit to both health\u000d\u000a      and the environment [see, for example, [5.4] which\u000d\u000a      also makes reference to the Montreal protocol and cites the Loughborough\u000d\u000a      University group M.I.

Dissemination activities\u000d\u000a      including workshops, conferences, publications and training courses\u000d\u000a      organised by NML (largely through the efforts of staff from the\u000d\u000a      Loughborough University group) led to acceptance of the technique\u000d\u000a          within the conservation profession [5.1]. Within the\u000d\u000a      UK, most major museums now have their own laser cleaning system and a\u000d\u000a      number of conservators trained in its use. These institutions include: The\u000d\u000a      British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Natural History Museum,\u000d\u000a      Birmingham Museum, Manchester Museum, National Museums Liverpool and\u000d\u000a      Historic Scotland [5.1]. Members of the group have been on the\u000d\u000a      Permanent Scientific Committee of the Lasers in the Conservation of\u000d\u000a      Artworks conference series since its inception in 1995. LACONA is now held\u000d\u000a      every two years and is attended by 150-200 delegates from around the world\u000d\u000a      [5.1]. Dr Cooper published the first book to be written on this\u000d\u000a      subject (with John Larson) entitled, Laser Cleaning in Conservation: An\u000d\u000a      Introduction (Conservation and Museology), Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann\u000d\u000a      (1998) ISBN-13:978-0750631174 (also translated into Italian ISBN-13:\u000d\u000a      978-8470904172).

The precision of laser cleaning means that the technique goes\u000d\u000a      beyond restoring aesthetics but also to revealing problems that can affect\u000d\u000a      the long term survival of the pieces themselves. For this reason much of\u000d\u000a      the research carried out at Loughborough University focused on the use of\u000d\u000a      lasers to clean and preserve monuments, paintings and other artefacts.\u000d\u000a      Techniques developed by the Loughborough University group have been\u000d\u000a      applied to the restoration of historical, antiquated and artistic pieces\u000d\u000a      that are of great cultural and academic importance (see later).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Much of the work carried out at Loughborough University focused on\u000d\u000a        laser cleaning as a precise tool for the cleaning of objects. It was\u000d\u000a        shown that lasers could be used to circumvent the severe damage of an\u000d\u000a        object's surface caused by traditional approaches to cleaning such as\u000d\u000a        using an air-abrasive or steam [3.1]. This work supported the\u000d\u000a        use of lasers as the preferred method to clean and preserve artefacts of\u000d\u000a        high intrinsic or cultural value.\u000d\u000a      Characterisation of the effects of laser cleaning on limestone was a\u000d\u000a        specific contribution that led to the adoption of lasers as a tool for\u000d\u000a        cleaning and preservation historical monuments and other important stone\u000d\u000a        artefacts [3.2].\u000d\u000a      The application of Q-switched YAG laser systems for laser cleaning\u000d\u000a        form a substantive part of the Loughborough University group's\u000d\u000a        portfolio. Demonstrating that the relatively low cost YAG Q-switched\u000d\u000a        lasers were suited to cleaning is a contributing factor to their wide\u000d\u000a        adoption in industry [e.g. 3.2, 3.3].\u000d\u000a      The research addressed the removal of corrosion, polymers and paints\u000d\u000a        from a variety of surfaces as well as the effect of lasers on pigments.\u000d\u000a        Detailed studies were carried out on: discolouration, laser-induced\u000d\u000a        reduction, splashing and other \"detrimental to surface effects\" such as\u000d\u000a        the interaction of a laser-generated `bubble' with a boundary. This\u000d\u000a        research helped establish laser cleaning as a technique that could have\u000d\u000a        wide application, ranging from stonework through to parchment [e.g.\u000d\u000a          3.4, 3.5, 3.6].\u000d\u000a      This research was underpinned using a variety of spectroscopic and\u000d\u000a        surface analysis techniques including: visual observation, reflectance\u000d\u000a        spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,\u000d\u000a        X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD), transmission electron\u000d\u000a        microscopy, Mach-Zehnder interferometry and schlieren photography\u000d\u000a        techniques [3.1-3.6].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5976","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    We now provide evidence to show that the research findings that we have\u000d\u000a      cited in 3.1 and 3.2 have resulted in two major impacts:\u000d\u000a    (1) the design and production of a new generation of sound barrier for a\u000d\u000a      wide range of industrial and business partners, a number of them leaders\u000d\u000a      in their field.

Whilst these traditional methods can be\u000d\u000a      very effective they generally suffer from the major disadvantage of\u000d\u000a      preventing the free flow of air and light through the barrier. Recent\u000d\u000a      years have seen a growing interest in the potential for use of sonic\u000d\u000a      crystals &#8212; arrays of cylindrical rods &#8212; as noise barriers. An advantage of\u000d\u000a      sonic crystals (SCs) is that by varying the distance between the rods it\u000d\u000a      is possible to attain peaks of attenuation in a selected range of\u000d\u000a      frequencies.\u000d\u000a    A further advantage of an SC barrier in comparison to more traditional\u000d\u000a      sound barriers are its ability to allow light to pass and, uniquely, that\u000d\u000a      it does not present an obstruction to the free flow of air. However,\u000d\u000a      barriers using `conventional' SCs suffer from the major disadvantage of\u000d\u000a      providing attenuation only over a rather narrow frequency band (and\u000d\u000a      harmonics thereof) and are therefore unsuitable as barriers to broad band\u000d\u000a      sound.\u000d\u000a    The concept of using Locally Resonant Sonic Crystals (LRSC) in which the\u000d\u000a      cylinders in the array act individually as resonators whose frequency\u000d\u000a      differs from that of the array helps to alleviate this problem but broad\u000d\u000a      band attenuation is still not achieved. Experimental and modelling work\u000d\u000a      carried out in the Loughborough University Physics Department by research\u000d\u000a      students and latterly postdoctoral researchers Dan Elford and Luke\u000d\u000a      Chalmers (2007-2013) under the joint supervision of Prof. Kusmartsev (Head\u000d\u000a      of Department, staff member 1990 to date) and Dr. Swallowe (Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer, staff member 1984 to date) [3.1, 3.2] in which the use\u000d\u000a      of multiple active Helmholtz resonators as scattering elements was\u000d\u000a      investigated has shown that carefully designed LRSCs can provide\u000d\u000a      attenuation well in excess of that provided by normal `mass law'\u000d\u000a      attenuators and in broader frequency ranges than conventional LRSCs.\u000d\u000a    The key aspects of the research outcomes and the potential impact are\u000d\u000a      that with LRSC systems attenuation is as good as with conventional\u000d\u000a      barriers but\u000d\u000a    1) In all situations a flow of air and light is possible &#8212; thus systems\u000d\u000a      such as industrial compressors can be acoustically shielded without being\u000d\u000a      enclosed. This is a major advantage since air flow is required to provide\u000d\u000a      cooling [3.1, 3.2]\u000d\u000a    2) LRSCs can be manufactured from a very wide range of materials and can\u000d\u000a      be used to architecturally enhance the appearance of a building while\u000d\u000a      providing (when used as a window covering) shade from direct sunlight and\u000d\u000a      attenuation of exterior sound along with a free flow of cool air [3.1,\u000d\u000a        3.2]\u000d\u000a    3) Conventional sound barriers for outdoor use (e.g. along motorways in\u000d\u000a      residential areas) are intermittently subjected to very considerable wind\u000d\u000a      loading resulting in the need for massive supports. The wind permeability\u000d\u000a      of LRSC barriers considerably alleviates this requirement [3.1, 3.2]\u000d\u000a    4) Barriers can attenuate at low acoustic frequencies without the need to\u000d\u000a      satisfy the mass law.

An STFC press release about the first Keele-led, WASP-South\u000a      planets (published 2008) led to CNN and Time magazine listing the\u000a      discovery in their \"Top ten science discoveries\" of the year. As a result\u000a      our discoveries were mentioned by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown as an\u000a      example of \"British scientists continuously breaking new ground\" in the\u000a      2009 Romanes lecture at Oxford, on British science policy.\u000a    A 2009 Nature press release about WASP-18 (the most intense planet-star\u000a      tidal interaction) led to an Associated Press article and was widely\u000a      published in British, European and US newspapers (e.g. The Independent,\u000a      The Times, The Guardian), and featured on 62 internet websites including\u000a      the BBC News front page. A 2010 STFC press release on WASP-17 (the first\u000a      planet in a retrograde orbit) was reported in over 20 newspapers worldwide\u000a      including The Independent, Guardian, New York Times, LA Times, and a\u000a      Brazilian newspaper, and again featured on over 50 websites including the\u000a      BBC News. An ESO press release in 2010 led to coverage across Europe,\u000a      including in The Times. A 2011 Nature\/NASA\/STFC press release on the\u000a      \"Carbon planet\" WASP- 12 was widely reported in newspapers (e.g. The\u000a      Times, Telegraph, LA Times, Time magazine) and over 60 internet websites.\u000a      Other newspaper coverage of WASP included a six-page feature on exoplanets\u000a      in The Sunday Times magazine (readership 2.5 million) April 8th 2012, an\u000a      article in the Wall Street Journal (Sept 2011), and an article in Time\u000a      Magazine (Dec 2010). Keele astronomers have also been interviewed by BBC\u000a      Radio Wales, BBC Radio Five, and other stations including Colombian\u000a      National Public Radio.\u000a    Turning to television, WASP featured on BBC1's \"Bang goes the Theory\" and\u000a      \"The Sky at Night\" (both 2009), while an episode of BBC2's \"Cosmos: A\u000a      Beginners Guide\" with Adam Hart-Davis was centred on WASP. In 2011 Brian\u000a      Cox's \"Wonders of the Solar System\" (BBC2, March 2011) featured a \"visit\"\u000a      to the WASP-8b as a high-gravity planet (simulated with a centrifuge); the\u000a      audience of 3.34 million was the highest on BBC2 that week.\u000a    In 2012 Jan 18th BBC2's \"Stargazing Live\" with Brian Cox centred on\u000a      exoplanets and featured WASP, including a live link-up to WASP-South and\u000a      an interview with a Keele postdoc. Prof. Hellier acted as an advisor. With\u000a      2.7m viewers Stargazing Live was the most-viewed BBC2 program that week.\u000a      The impact of such programs is demonstrated by the fact that Amazon.co.uk\u000a      reported a 500% increase in sales of telescopes that week.\u000a    In conjunction with the 2013 Stargazing Live, BBC1's Midlands Today\u000a      (audience 600,000) featured research by Midlands' Universities that had\u000a      appeared on Stargazing Live, and included an interview with Prof. Hellier.\u000a      Other TV programs featuring WASP discoveries are the Discovery Channel\u000a      programs made by Pioneer TV \"Planets from Hell\" (July 25 2012) and\u000a      \"Extreme Orbits\" (August 8 2012).

We have featured in the local paper (The Evening Sentinel) on\u000a      seven occasions and on BBC Radio Stoke four times. When doing so we\u000a      include invitations to Keele campus observatory, which is open to the\u000a      public twice weekly and on special occasions. Over 500 visitors came\u000a      during each Stargazing Live week, where we link viewing planets through\u000a      our observatory's telescopes to Keele's WASP research. In addition the\u000a      regular openings attract 1000 visitors per year, while we host many visits\u000a      from school and scout groups over a year. We have three times run evening\u000a      classes on exoplanets for mature students, and, further, Keele's Science\u000a      Learning Centre has ten times run CPD courses for schoolteachers featuring\u000a      exoplanets and the WASP discoveries.\u000a    Recognising, however, that those attracted to Keele campus will be mostly\u000a      those who already have an interest in science, we have also developed an\u000a      outreach program taking WASP science into schools.

We are the first generation to know that many stars have planets\u000a      orbiting them and to know what planets outside our solar system are like.\u000a      This research is having a large impact on society, spreading out through\u000a      newspapers, the internet, TV programs and books into popular culture.\u000a    For understanding exoplanets the transiting systems are crucial since\u000a      they are the only ones for which we can get reliable sizes and masses and\u000a      hence obtain their density and deduce their composition. The first\u000a      transiting exoplanet was found only in 2001. There are now 200 known\u000a      transiting exoplanets with measured sizes and masses. The WASP project\u000a      (Wide Area Search for Planets) has produced over one third of these, and,\u000a      along with NASA's Kepler mission, is currently the world's most successful\u000a      search for transiting exoplanets.\u000a    WASP-South is WASP's Southern Hemisphere transit-search facility. It was\u000a      built by Keele University in 2005 and Keele have operated it ever since.\u000a      Keele process the WASP-South data and have led the discovery of Southern\u000a      Hemisphere transiting exoplanets, collaborating with other WASP institutes\u000a      and the Universities of Geneva and Liege for spectroscopic and photometric\u000a      followup. WASP-South, led by Keele, has found 57 of the 58 brightest\u000a      transiting-exoplanet systems in the Southern Hemisphere.\u000a    Since 2006 there have been 120 refereed-journal papers from the WASP\u000a      project with Keele as authors, and Keele is the lead-author institute on\u000a      37 of them. Keele has lead-authored the discovery papers for more\u000a      transiting exoplanet systems than any other institute worldwide. There\u000a      have been more than 3800 citations to these WASP papers (from NASA's ADS).\u000a      In 2010 the WASP consortium were awarded the Royal Astronomical Society's\u000a      Group Achievement Award.\u000a    The Keele WASP team is led by Prof. Coel Hellier and includes academics\u000a      Dr. Pierre Maxted (Reader) and Dr. Barry Smalley (Senior Lecturer), all of\u000a      whom have been involved since the beginning of WASP-South in 2004, and Dr.\u000a      John Southworth (a WASP PDRA from 2009, then an STFC Advanced Fellow, and\u000a      now also a lecturer at Keele).\u000a    The WASP discoveries have had a vast influence on our understanding of\u000a      extra-solar planets, particularly the hot Jupiter class.

This publication states that \"Impacts from the SRS include the\u000a      creation of knowledge, improved quality of life in the UK, the generation\u000a      and transfer of skills, improved competitiveness of industry, the\u000a      commercialisation of technology, financial effects and the creation of\u000a      jobs.\" The input of many Keele staff to central facilities, particularly\u000a      the SRS and the ILL, has been in instrumentation, techniques, support, and\u000a      training, each of which impacts significantly at many economic and social\u000a      levels.

Keele University was central to this exchange,\u000a      providing a series of academics as joint appointments (including Greenhough,\u000a        Glover, Greenall, Stirling, Catlow, Fitch) from the first days in\u000a      1981 through to closure of the SRS in 2008.\u000a    The 2007 Research Councils UK report by PA consulting, \"Study\u000a          on the economic impact of the Research Councils\" has a section\u000a      specifically devoted to the impact of Protein Crystallography (PX) at the\u000a      SRS, where Keele led from day 1 through several Joint appointments and\u000a      subsequently Keele PhD students who moved to positions there and elsewhere\u000a      following graduation. \"At the heart of Central Facilities are the\u000a      development scientists and the user support staff, forming a focus for\u000a      serving and training a vast community of engineers, scientists, academics\u000a      and pharmaceutical companies.\" The report details examples of the\u000a      contribution of PX at the SRS to drug discovery, citing the enzyme purine\u000a      nucleoside phosphorylase (teams from Alabama and Keele including Greenhough)\u000a      which provided a starting point to design new drugs to target diseases\u000a      such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's\u000a      disease, one of which underwent clinical trial and was licensed to a major\u000a      pharmaceutical company. The report adds that commercial users of the PX\u000a      facilities included 16 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as\u000a      AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Astex Therapeutics.\u000a    The impact that Keele continues to have through Central Facilities and\u000a      current (Forsyth, Teixeira, Greenhough, Sule-Suso, Telling) past\u000a      (for example Myles, Langan) and future Keele researchers\u000a      (currently 12 Keele PhD students are engaged in projects utilising\u000a      Diamond, ILL, the ESRF, APS, SOLEIL) is huge. The RCUK report by PA\u000a      confirms this by showing that \"Structural biology and the way it is done\u000a      now would not be possible without the SRS and the subsequent development\u000a      of other sources. Difficult proteins would not have been solved without\u000a      the improvements in technology and the speed of crystallographic structure\u000a      determination would be prohibitive.\" This applies to the human C-reactive\u000a      protein structure, a landmark work in 1996 led by two still current Keele\u000a      staff (Shrive, Greenhough) and made possible by the SRS\u000a      following some 50 years of effort world wide. Cited 190 times, it\u000a      continues to underline the impact of basic science on medical practice,\u000a      underpinned by widespread publicity ranging from blanket GP circulars\u000a      (print and video) to Newsweek. This raised awareness, and the scientific\u000a      work itself, has contributed significantly to the subsequent debate\u000a      surrounding the molecule and its role in CVD and to the increased\u000a      importance of raised levels in the clinical setting, particularly for\u000a      at-risk patients. The RCUK report by PA also confirms that\u000a      \"the ribosome structure, a fundamental scientific breakthrough which may\u000a      lend itself to drug discovery, relied heavily on the ability to rapidly\u000a      screen crystals at the SRS\". This screening was carried out on stations\u000a      developed and supported by Keele staff.\u000a    While closure of the SRS in 2008 ended almost 30 years of pivotal Keele\u000a      involvement in the support, training and achievements of many thousands of\u000a      Daresbury users, with lasting impact on the \"scientific, industrial and\u000a      skill base of the UK\", the Keele impact then accelerated through leading\u000a      roles in the establishment of the next generation of central facilities\u000a      with many continuing to play key roles in training, advising and\u000a      transferring key skills and technology to these facilities. The subsequent\u000a      and current senior roles at these new facilities continue to impact on a\u000a      global scale.\u000a    Keele has played, and continues to play through Forsyth and Teixeira,\u000a      a major role in the development, support and exploitation of neutron\u000a      scattering for the study of biological molecules and industrial materials,\u000a      impacting particularly on the pharmaceutical and polymer industries and\u000a      the training of the next generation of scientists with diverse and\u000a      essential skills for the workplace. The 2012 STFC report on Neutron\u000a      scattering Materials research for modern life (STFC, 2012)\u000a      gives examples of the significant medical, social and economic impact that\u000a      neutron scattering science contributes to our lives, with the study of\u000a      biological molecules enabling \"Multidisciplinary teams of medics,\u000a      physicists, materials scientists, chemists and engineers to come together\u000a      to make key breakthroughs in using materials in medicine\". Much of this\u000a      work has been made possible through the input and expertise of Keele\u000a      staff. Major awards of over &#163;2m to Forsyth and Fuller with\u000a      a variety of collaborators provided the funding to develop the facilities\u000a      and construct \"A Laboratory to support the Deuteration of Biological\u000a      Macromolecules\" (Led by Forsyth in collaboration with Myles,\u000a      then at EMBL) as outlined in the ILL Millenium Programme proposal\u000a          of 2001. In January 2003, Business, the\u000a      quarterly magazine of the BBSRC, included reference to the major Keele-led\u000a      developments in progress at the ILL which will \"mean that biologists can\u000a      contemplate experiments that were simply impossible previously\", while the\u000a      EPSRC Newsline reported that a key aim of the facility was\u000a      to \"develop and train the UK user base\" for these techniques.\u000a    In 2013 the Report from the ILL Associates' Working Group on\u000a          Neutrons in Europe for 2025 concluded that neutrons will\u000a      remain an essential tool for science and industry including not only\u000a      materials science but also the environment, life sciences and information\u000a      technology. \"Some two thirds of neutron scattering studies contribute\u000a      directly to or closely underpin the needs of industry\". Keele, through Forsyth\u000a      and Teixeira, and the next generation of Central Facility experts\u000a      currently being trained as PhD students between Keele and the ILL, will\u000a      continue to play a pivotal role in delivering and exploiting this science\u000a      and enabling the accompanying economic and social impact.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Keele University has made sustained and seminal contributions to the\u000a      development and use of central facilities (Synchrotron radiation, Neutron\u000a      scattering) which started over 30 years ago and are still in progress\u000a      today. Past and present academics at all levels from Keele who began this\u000a      work have gone on not only to carry out their own ground breaking research\u000a      using these facilities but, in many cases, to have a major social,\u000a      economic and industrial impact, through key roles in development, support\u000a      and techniques and through the present, current and next generation of\u000a      scientific, management and technical expertise at Central Facilities\u000a      around the world. This includes numerous postgraduate students, Research\u000a      Associates and academic staff. The contribution to Science and Technology\u000a      has enabled significant breakthroughs in many aspects of science and\u000a      medicine, accompanied by direct economic and social impact and a unique\u000a      and ongoing contribution to the current generation of SR and neutron\u000a      sources, their scientific staff and their users.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Keele University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Keele University","InstitutionName":"Keele University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10007767}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4829764","Name":"Alabama"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

The impact was and\u000a      continues to be enormous for those who exploit Central Facilities for\u000a      scientific, technical and commercially motivated research across the\u000a      physical and life sciences. Over thirty years ago in the then Department\u000a      of Physics at Keele, Watson Fuller and John Helliwell (who\u000a      went on to play a pivotal role in not only methods development but also\u000a      management and Leadership, for example as CCLRC Director of SR Science\u000a      based at Daresbury (2002); President of the European Crystallographic\u000a      Association (2006-2009); Editor in Chief Acta Crystallographica\u000a      (1996-2005)) were central to the development of the dedicated Synchrotron\u000a      Radiation Source (SRS) at Daresbury for protein crystallography, fibre\u000a      diffraction and small angle scattering for the investigation of molecular\u000a      structure and organization in a wide range of naturally occurring and\u000a      synthetic materials.

[A-C]. This technology is now widely\u000a      used in many applications, some of which also link directly back to the\u000a      work of Batchelder et al. on explosives detection [2] and\u000a      drug identification [6]. Current Raman technology applications include:\u000a    - Pharmaceuticals [D]: Raman spectra are used to generate chemical images\u000a      and thus for applications such as rapid screening and polymorph\u000a      discrimination.\u000a    - Carbon and Diamond [E]: Raman spectroscopy is used for quality control\u000a      of carbon and diamond coatings.\u000a    - Materials Science [F]: Raman analysis is used extensively, for many\u000a      materials such as composites, polymers and catalyst reagents.\u000a    - Geosciences and Gemology [G]: Raman spectroscopy is used widely for\u000a      analysis of geological materials and also for the classification and\u000a      valuation of gem stones.\u000a    - Forensic Science [H]: Raman techniques are employed widely in evidence\u000a      analysis, for their ability to identify without contamination very small\u000a      samples of substances such as drugs, gunshot residue, paint chips, ink,\u000a      etc.. In particular, the use of Raman spectroscopy for the identification\u000a      of gunshot residue is on the increase due to the introduction of\u000a      \"non-toxic\/lead-free\" ammunition increasing the chances of false positives\u000a      from previously applied methods.\u000a    - Nanotechnology [I]: Novel Raman techniques enable analysis below micron\u000a      scales and thus characterisation of nanomaterials such as carbon\u000a      nanotubes.\u000a    - Art and Heritage [J]: Raman spectra can identify pigments and\u000a      authenticate works of art. The technology has been used for investigation\u000a      of the Turin Shroud, the Lindisfarne Gospels and demonstrating the Vinland\u000a      Map as a fake.\u000a    - Semiconductors and Devices [K]: Raman analysis can reveal stress,\u000a      strain and impurity or dopant levels in semiconductors and devices,\u000a      providing a tool for R&amp;D and quality control during manufacturing.\u000a    (ii) Economic Impact during the REF period\u000a    Major economic impact has arisen from the creation of new Raman\u000a      microscope technology that is commercially viable, based on the\u000a      underpinning R&amp;D work by Batchelder et al.. This\u000a      technology generated expansion of the Renishaw product range to include\u000a      Raman microscopes, with all the accompanying jobs and economic benefits.\u000a      The Raman Spectroscopy Division now represents a multi-million pound pa\u000a      revenue stream within Renishaw plc.\u000a      The major economic impact of Raman lies predominantly within the\u000a      Healthcare section of the Renishaw group. Renishaw Healthcare contributed\u000a      &#163;21.7 million to the revenue of Renishaw in 2011, amounting to 8% of the\u000a      group's total income, with the predominant income source being the\u000a      spectroscopic instrument range based on the patents and technology\u000a      developed by Batchelder [L]. The first half of 2012 saw a\u000a      streamlining of Renishaw Healthcare but nevertheless still with growth in\u000a      the Raman spectroscopy range (Raman AFM package introduced) leading to a\u000a      27% increase in revenue compared with the same period of 2011 [M].\u000a      Furthermore, from [P]: The Healthcare section of the group contributed\u000a        &#163;29 million to the revenue of Renishaw in 2013, some 9% of Renishaw\u000a        total turnover. The Chairman's statement on Healthcare for the 2013\u000a        annual report stated \"Spectroscopy sales continued to be the main driver\u000a        in this business segment and were at a record level.\"\u000a      Renishaw offer a product line including a very large number of flexible\u000a      configurations of a fundamental Raman microscope device, within which the\u000a      innovations of Batchelder et al. are highly visible in the\u000a      optical setup of all the available Raman configurations [C-E]. From\u000a      2008-13, Renishaw have produced the world's best selling research Raman\u000a      microscope, the inVia [N]. As evidenced from [P]: The innovations of\u000a      Batchelder et al. have been incorporated in the inVia\u000a        microsope product which has been the world's best-selling research Raman\u000a        system 2008-13.\u000a    New Directions and Applications\u000a    Raman analysis continues to have growing impact as a research tool. For\u000a      example, Renishaw Raman microscopes based on the work of Batchelder\u000a      et al. have been used by Oxford, Cambridge and other leading\u000a      universities to research the role of defects in graphene [O], paving the\u000a      way towards industrial manufacture and application of graphene in the\u000a      future.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Batchelder at Leeds undertook key aspects in the\u000a      research, design, development and application of Raman microscopes.

In 1993\u000a        Batchelder (Leeds), and Renishaw plc, obtained a US patent\u000a      (5,194,912) for the concept of Raman Analysis Apparatus based on the use\u000a      of a CCD detector for the detection of Raman scattered light. A key\u000a      ingredient was the use of an angle-tuned interference filter, which\u000a      allowed the move away from a conventional monochromator, plus entrance and\u000a      exit slit based geometries and hence to the formation of a more compact\u000a      system with higher optical throughput. The step change in Raman analysis\u000a      performance came about through the application of filters. This initial\u000a      research has formed the basis of all the microscopes subsequently\u000a      developed; however, further research and refinements were made including\u000a      extension into UV and IR excitation regimes, as well as the development of\u000a      compact systems for drugs and explosives detection and importantly a Raman\u000a      microscopy capability [1]. The technological importance of Batchelder's\u000a      initial research work, was recognised with award of the Annual\u000a        Achievement Award of the Worshipful Company of Instrument Makers in\u000a      1994.\u000a    In order to exploit the filtering improvements to Raman technology, in 1997\u000a      Leeds (Batchelder) and Renishaw obtained a US patent (5,623,342)\u000a      for the \"Raman Microscope\" based on tuneable filters. Following this, in 1998\u000a      (5,818,047) a US patent was granted between the University of Leeds,\u000a      Renishaw plc and the Home Office (Prof. Richard Lacey) for a \"detector of\u000a      explosive substances\", to implement a simplified instrument in airport\u000a      ticket handling systems [2,3].\u000a    In 2001 Baldwin and Batchelder developed a model that\u000a      takes into account spherical aberration from refraction through a planar\u000a      surface when performing Raman spectroscopy. They found that there is an\u000a      optimum numerical aperture for collected light intensity at a given depth.\u000a      As Raman microscopy is often carried out on microscopic objects that are\u000a      designed to operate in air, the air\/particle interface will adversely\u000a      affect the confocal properties of the microscope. When performing Raman\u000a      confocal microspectroscopy, the interaction of light with a planar surface\u000a      can cause spherical aberration through refraction, which subsequently\u000a      causes problems and can substantially degrade the performance of the\u000a      microscope. The spherical aberration increases the range of focal depths\u000a      accessible by the rays of the illuminating laser. The scattering volume\u000a      defined by the confocal aperture thus becomes distorted which leads to a\u000a      dramatic fall in collected light intensity with increasing depth. The\u000a      refraction model provides guidance on how to select the dimensions of the\u000a      aperture to give the least effect of distortion for a given depth. The\u000a      refraction model has thus provided an important tool for minimising these\u000a      adverse aberration effects in Raman technology [4].\u000a    As Raman microscopes are used to obtain spectroscopic readings from\u000a      various materials and substances, these devices can be found in many\u000a      academic research and industrial R&amp;D laboratories worldwide. The work\u000a      of Baldwin and Batchelder has therefore made a significant\u000a      impact in laboratories globally, by optimising numerical apertures for\u000a      selected focal depths. Furthermore, the model has a wide reach as it can\u000a      be applied to any situation that requires probing deep through an\u000a      interface, such as depth profiling of layered materials, identifying\u000a      inclusions within minerals, and investigating sub-cellular features in\u000a      biological specimens.\u000a    In 2002 Batchelder and co-workers developed a simple chemical\u000a      method (mirror reaction) to form a silver substrate that can obtain a\u000a      strong surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal. This method is\u000a      particularly suited to the preparation of metalised nanoscale probes for\u000a      near field imaging applications [5]. Such imaging is essential for some of\u000a      the Raman applications identified in section 4.\u000a    In 2006 Batchelder and co-workers used the Raman microscope to\u000a      investigate the effect of changing wavelength on 4 different drug\u000a      substances. This work was able to demonstrate the dependence of the Raman\u000a      spectra of certain pharmaceutical substances upon laser excitation [6].\u000a      The Raman spectroscopy research carried out in this work has a wide reach\u000a      as it is easily applicable to any field that needs to identify substances\u000a      based on their molecular properties. The Raman microscope can obtain\u000a      spectroscopic data, by using a laser to probe the vibrational energy\u000a      levels of molecules. The Raman spectrum obtained from this process\u000a      exhibits a set of characteristic peaks that are indicative of the\u000a      characteristic vibrational frequencies of the substance or material. In\u000a      particular the various organic molecules that can be synthesised to make\u000a      pharmaceuticals have characteristic peaks depending on their carbon, OH\u000a      and other bonds. As such the Raman microscope has particular significance\u000a      in identifying illicit drugs and can thus make an important contribution\u000a      to forensic science. In addition, Raman spectroscopy can also identify\u000a      inorganic molecules by detecting low frequency shifts that can be\u000a      associated with the internal dynamics of inorganic molecules. This opens\u000a      the door to a much wider applicability of the Raman microscope, such as\u000a      the study and characterisation of gunshot residue (organic and inorganic),\u000a      paint chips and historical artefacts. An initial example of applied Raman\u000a      research was demonstrated by Batchelder's role for 18 months as an\u000a      expert witness for SmithKline Beecham vs Apotex, establishing a dedicated\u000a      Raman laboratory in Leeds for testing polymorphism in Paxil (a $3.2billion\u000a      dollar per annum worldwide market).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6331","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    PATHWAY TO IMPACT\u000d\u000a      Protein stability studies are essential in the biopharmaceutical industry\u000d\u000a      to identify suitable\u000d\u000a      candidate product formulations and eliminate the costs associated with the\u000d\u000a      development (and later\u000d\u000a      failure) of unstable molecules.

The Optim1000 platform for high throughput,\u000d\u000a      micro-volume protein stability\u000d\u000a      analysis was launched in April 2009. Towards the end of the REF Impact\u000d\u000a      Period the Optim 1000\u000d\u000a      was been replaced with an improved product, the Optim 2.\u000d\u000a    Saving biopharma time and money and reducing risk\u000d\u000a    Optim1000 has allowed biopharmaceutical researchers to analyse the\u000d\u000a      effects of temperature, time\u000d\u000a      and the chemical environment on small quantities of biomolecule with high\u000d\u000a      throughput. Optim1000\u000d\u000a      could analyse up to 96 samples in a working day, using only 9&#181;l sample\u000d\u000a      volumes (as little as 0.1&#181;g\u000d\u000a      protein [D]). The Optim 2 can analyse up to 48 temperature controlled\u000d\u000a      samples simultaneously,\u000d\u000a      with an increase to 144 samples per day and has retained the `best in\u000d\u000a      class' sample volume (9&#181;l)\u000d\u000a      of the Optim 1000 [C].\u000d\u000a    Studies have shown that even the previous Optim1000 technology \"is at\u000d\u000a      least fifty times faster and\u000d\u000a      consumes significantly less protein than alternative technologies to\u000d\u000a      obtain the same information.\"\u000d\u000a      [D]. The requirement for less protein sample material also allows\u000d\u000a      laboratories to perform stability\u000d\u000a      studies much earlier in the R&amp;D process, reducing waste in reagents\u000d\u000a      and resource and the costs of\u000d\u000a      scaling up production to generate sufficient quantities of sample for\u000d\u000a      analysis. Optim1000 and now\u000d\u000a      Optim 2 marketing asserts that the early analysis facilitated by the\u000d\u000a      system \"eliminates the cost\u000d\u000a        associated with the unnecessary development of candidates or\u000d\u000a        formulations that do not have the\u000d\u000a        potential to proceed and dramatically reduces the chance of late-stage\u000d\u000a        failure.\" [C].\u000d\u000a    Clear evidence of the rapid sample screening advantages of Optim\u000d\u000a      technology is given in the\u000d\u000a      customer testimonies [J]. For example, Royal DSM state \"With the Optim\u000d\u000a        we simply get answers\u000d\u000a        more quickly with far less effort. We test large numbers of\u000d\u000a        formulations, screening many variants to\u000d\u000a        get a new stable end product and can pick the top three to take ahead to\u000d\u000a        more in-depth real-time\u000d\u000a        stability studies. Eliminating the poor candidates very early in the\u000d\u000a        process saves us so much time.\"\u000d\u000a      Besides time (and thus cost saving), another very important impact of\u000d\u000a      Optim technology is the\u000d\u000a      reduction of risk in a drug development programme, as highlighted by\u000d\u000a      Syntaxin Ltd [J]: \"The Optim\u000d\u000a        1000 fluorescence and light-scattering instrument provides data-rich\u000d\u000a        analysis using very small\u000d\u000a        amounts of material.

In 2003 Dr Alistair Smith (School of Physics and\u000d\u000a      Astronomy) and Professor Sheena\u000d\u000a      Radford (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology) developed\u000d\u000a      techniques to observe protein\u000d\u000a      structural changes during rapid (microsecond) temperature switches [1-3].\u000d\u000a      In [1] a custom built\u000d\u000a      fluorescence microscope was used to monitor the unfolding of the immunity\u000d\u000a      protein Im9, using\u000d\u000a      diffusion single pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In [2] the\u000d\u000a      transition state of the Im7\u000d\u000a      folding intermediate was characterised using a combination of protein\u000d\u000a      engineering, ultra rapid\u000d\u000a      mixing and stopped flow experiments. All this led to the design and\u000d\u000a      construction of instrumentation\u000d\u000a      capable of heating samples very rapidly. Specifically, the researchers\u000d\u000a      were able to build an\u000d\u000a      instrument which could increase the temperature of a sample by up to 25&#176;C\u000d\u000a      in 8 nanoseconds\u000d\u000a      whilst taking spectroscopic readings over the same timeframe.

Typically, sample\u000d\u000a      solutions and reagents are\u000d\u000a      mixed rapidly to initiate chemical reactions and trigger dynamic folding\u000d\u000a      processes. However, early\u000d\u000a      events in the folding process, such as the formation of folding\u000d\u000a      intermediates, are difficult to study\u000d\u000a      because they exist transitorily during the `dead time' while reagent\u000d\u000a      mixing is still taking place.\u000d\u000a    In 2006 Smith and Radford developed devices so they could monitor\u000d\u000a      unfolding kinetics by\u000d\u000a      fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy on rapid timescales of 20msec upwards,\u000d\u000a      crucially using\u000d\u000a      small protein sample volumes. They developed two novel, different `T\u000d\u000a      mixers' that use moderate\u000d\u000a      flow rates (0.2-0.4ml\/s) to achieve mixing times as low as 20\u000d\u000a      microseconds. They demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that fluorescence and ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy\u000d\u000a      instrumentation could monitor the\u000d\u000a      early stages of protein folding using only milligrams of a sample &#8212; a\u000d\u000a      significant advance where\u000d\u000a      quantities of available protein are limited.\u000d\u000a    The microfluidic T mixers were evaluated and shown to enable the\u000d\u000a      spectroscopic monitoring of\u000d\u000a      protein folding reactions of up to several milliseconds [4].

These paths led directly from\u000d\u000a      the advances made with the composite polymer materials. Initially in 1994\u000d\u000a      it was evident that the hot compaction technology could have a significant\u000d\u000a      commercial application [1]. A small spin out company VANTAGE POLYMERS was\u000d\u000a      created under the auspices of Leeds Innovations with Ward as\u000d\u000a      Managing Director and several full time and part time staff. This venture\u000d\u000a      was initially funded by Hoechst Celanese as licensee of the Leeds high\u000d\u000a      modulus polyethylene fibre technology, and later by the Ford Motor\u000d\u000a      Company. The creation of the company enabled further progress on\u000d\u000a      developmental work and commercialisation by Ward and M Bonner also of the\u000d\u000a      University of Leeds, with direct support from PROPEX, BTG and other\u000d\u000a      interested parties. In 2000, the commercial operations were sufficiently\u000d\u000a      developed to transfer to BP AMOCO (now PROPEX FABRICS) under a major\u000d\u000a      licensing deal. Then in 2002, PROPEX FABRICS set up the first commercial\u000d\u000a      plant for Curv&#174; self reinforced PP composite at their site in\u000d\u000a      Gronau Germany [B].\u000d\u000a      The first impact that led from the licensing deal with PROPEX FABRICS\u000d\u000a      occurred in 2005. Samsonite pioneered the use of Curv&#174; to\u000d\u000a      produce a new range of lightweight, and impact resistant luggage as part\u000d\u000a      of their premier X'Lite collection [C]. \"Samsonite's use of CURV\u000d\u000a        composite is a revolution in the industry, providing the worldly\u000d\u000a        traveler with the best in performance,\" says Quentin Mackay,\u000d\u000a      Samsonite's Global Creative Director [C].\u000d\u000a    Impact during the REF period\u000d\u000a      The impact has expanded massively following the initial success of X'Lite.\u000d\u000a      In 2009 Samsonite extended the use of Curv&#174; to a higher volume\u000d\u000a      and more cost effective range of suitcases, the Cosmolite range [D]. The\u000d\u000a      Cosmolite range continues to be a successful product for Samsonite and has\u000d\u000a      received very favorable reviews from consumers and experts alike [E]. In\u000d\u000a      2009-2010 the Cosmolite suitcase was the number 1 seller of the whole\u000d\u000a      Samsonite range. It was also the highest selling suitcase in Europe in\u000d\u000a      2009-2010, with contribution to Samsonite's total net sales increasing\u000d\u000a      from 0.4% in 2008 to 7.5% in 2010 [F]. Successive generation of Samsonite\u000d\u000a      suitcases based on the Curv&#174; single polypropylene composite\u000d\u000a      included Cubelite&#174; (2010) [G] and Firelite&#174; (2012)..\u000d\u000a      This is both an economic and an environmental impact. Economically,\u000d\u000a      Samsonite has experienced a massive growth in sales since the introduction\u000d\u000a      of the Curv&#174; material. This distinct and material contribution\u000d\u000a      for polymer technology can be seen through the 34% increase in sales on\u000d\u000a      year ending 31st December 2011 [H]. This is a clear indication\u000d\u000a      of how significant the technology has been to industry on a global level.\u000d\u000a      Indeed, the 2011 Annual report reports (Financial Highlights on page 4)\u000d\u000a      that in addition to the 34% increase in net sales there has also been an\u000d\u000a      increase of 56.6% in adjusted net income and a 47.2% increase in adjusted\u000d\u000a      EBITDA [H]. The environmental aspect of the impact can be seen from\u000d\u000a      improved quality of the Samsonite suitcases. The composite material is\u000d\u000a      lighter, more durable, and more efficient to produce than materials\u000d\u000a      previously used by Samsonite.\u000d\u000a    A second impact, also of economic and environmental significance, that\u000d\u000a      has come from the licensing deal with PROPEX FABRICS is the introduction\u000d\u000a      of the Curv&#174; material to the manufacturing of audio technology\u000d\u000a      in the loudspeaker industry. Indeed, the loudspeaker consulting group\u000d\u000a      Menlo Scientific describe how the University of Leeds originally developed\u000d\u000a      the composite polymer technology before BP Amoco aquired the technology\u000d\u000a      and created PROPEX FABRICS to commercialise the process [J].\u000d\u000a    A third important economic impact has been in the market of sporting\u000d\u000a      goods. Bauer manufactures elite level hockey skates (the SUPREME and VAPOR\u000d\u000a      lines, both using Curv&#174;), and had 69% of the market share for\u000d\u000a      ice skates worn by USA professional National Hockey League players in 2011\u000d\u000a      [M,N].\u000d\u000a    Continuing Development and Impact\u000d\u000a    The reach of the composite polymer impact can be clearly seen from the\u000d\u000a      multi-partner industrial collaboration project FuturePlas [K]. In 2006\u000d\u000a      Leeds were part of a successful Technology Strategy Board (TSB) proposal\u000d\u000a      focused back on PE materials (Future Plas &#8212; Generating the next generation\u000d\u000a      of single polymer composites, &#163;250,000 2006-2008). The research undertaken\u000d\u000a      showed that the incorporation of an interleaved film was even more\u000d\u000a      important for these highly crystallised materials, which normally have a\u000d\u000a      very narrow melting range. Using a film it was shown that sheets with\u000d\u000a      significantly improved stiffness and strength could be obtained. Following\u000d\u000a      this, an EU FP7 research project (hivocomp.eu, &#163;600K, 2010-2014, with\u000d\u000a      Leeds, PROPEX, SAMSONITE, and 4 EU academic partners) was set up to focus\u000d\u000a      on achieving radical advances in composite materials for cost effective,\u000d\u000a      higher-volume production of high performance carbon fibre reinforced\u000d\u000a      parts. The project is analysing and developing self-reinforced composites\u000d\u000a      based on thermoplastic polypropylene and polyacrylamide, hybridised with\u000d\u000a      carbon fibre, with potential further high impact application in the\u000d\u000a      automotive, aerospace, and luxury luggage sectors. In addition another\u000d\u000a      spin off company was formed RIGICOMP headed by Ward which extends\u000d\u000a      the hot compaction technology for the manufacture of self reinforced\u000d\u000a      technology [L].\u000d\u000a    Summary\u000d\u000a      To recap, the underpinning research outlined in Section 2 created a range\u000d\u000a      of high-impact-resistant polymer composites, through cost-effective and\u000d\u000a      commercially exploitable methods. Polypropylene was identified as the most\u000d\u000a      appropriate polymer for which a wide reach of the technology was\u000d\u000a      applicable. A wide range of applications has been developed for the\u000d\u000a      material Curv&#174;, including anti- ballistic body armour, sports\u000d\u000a      goods (NIKE, BAUER), and lightweight luggage (SAMSONITE).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Workers at the University of Leeds researched, then developed and\u000d\u000a      patented the `hot compaction' process for the manufacture of single\u000d\u000a      polymer composites [1]. In this process highly oriented polymer fibres are\u000d\u000a      heated so that a proportion of the surface of every oriented element\u000d\u000a      melts. Upon cooling, this skin recrystallises to form the matrix of a\u000d\u000a      self-reinforced fibre composite. Important resultant properties include\u000d\u000a      high stiffness and strength, lightweight and outstanding impact strength,\u000d\u000a      leading to a material with crucial commercial advantage. The reach of this\u000d\u000a      impact is demonstrated by commercialisation of the polymer composite over\u000d\u000a      a wide range of applications including anti-ballistic body armour, sports\u000d\u000a      goods (Nike, Bauer), lightweight luggage (Samsonite), audio speakers\u000d\u000a      (Wharfedale) and radar covers for helicopters (Westland).

The strategy has been to\u000d\u000a      seek new materials and material improvements for rapid exploitation. The\u000d\u000a      underpinning research divides into three sections: (i) invention of `hot\u000d\u000a      compaction'; (ii) expansion of the polymer portfolio; (iii) focus on\u000d\u000a      polypropylene. (i) Preferred molecular orientation in a polymer leads to\u000d\u000a      enhanced strength, stiffness and toughness, without increasing density.\u000d\u000a      Background research by Professor Ian Ward of the University of\u000d\u000a      Leeds led to the development of a process for producing high modulus melt\u000d\u000a      spun polyethylene (PE) fibres based on these ideas. The original aim was\u000d\u000a      to use these PE fibres to replace the role of glass or carbon fibres in a\u000d\u000a      conventional polymer composite. However, the crucial novel idea, developed\u000d\u000a      by Ward, plus Dr PJ Hine and Mr K Norris also of\u000d\u000a      the University of Leeds, was to use the high modulus melt spun PE fibres\u000d\u000a      as both the reinforcing and the binder (or matrix) phase of a polymer\u000d\u000a      composite [2,3]. This was achieved through a process named `hot\u000d\u000a      compaction'. At a critical temperature, the surface of each individual\u000d\u000a      fibre could be `selectively' melted while retaining the fibre core. On\u000d\u000a      cooling, the molten material recrystallises, binding the structure\u000d\u000a      together producing a homogeneous all-polymer composite (in fact uniquely,\u000d\u000a      exactly the same polymer) [4]. The original research was carried out on\u000d\u000a      high modulus PE in 1993, under the EPSRC funded IRC in Polymer Science and\u000d\u000a      Technology (GR\/F37016\/01, &#163;10M, 1989-1994) [4]. This work led to the first\u000d\u000a      patent at Leeds in 1997 [2] and established all the important aspects of\u000d\u000a      the hot compaction process, such as the retention of molecular orientation\u000d\u000a      in the melting range of the fibres, the width of the process window and\u000d\u000a      evidence of epitaxial recrystallisation.\u000d\u000a      (ii) The British Technology Group (BTG) sponsored a two-year research\u000d\u000a      project (&#163;230k, 1993- 1995) to examine other polymers, notably gel spun\u000d\u000a      polyethylene fibres and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), leading to a\u000d\u000a      further four patents covering the effect of crosslinking on hot compaction\u000d\u000a      behaviour, the effect of slow cooling, the effect of fast cooling, and the\u000d\u000a      hot compaction of amorphous polymers. BTG currently license all eight hot\u000d\u000a      compaction patents.\u000d\u000a      (iii) Further crucial research results emerged from study of the\u000d\u000a      manufacture of sheets, use of postforming to produce real parts, and\u000d\u000a      detailed measurements of properties, especially for polypropylene, which\u000d\u000a      showed the greatest commercial potential. Reference [5] from 2003\u000d\u000a      summarises the research undertaken to establish the important parameters\u000d\u000a      that control the hot compaction behaviour of woven, oriented\u000d\u000a      polypropylene. This work established the best route for making the\u000d\u000a      commercial (Samsonite) hot compacted polypropylene materials (Curv&#174;), by\u000d\u000a      showing that the properties of the recrystallised matrix material are also\u000d\u000a      very important to the properties of the final self-reinforced composite\u000d\u000a      sheet. Reference [6] from 2008, which supported and built upon the very\u000d\u000a      important patent from 2003 [3], presents the most important recent\u000d\u000a      research, on the advantages of combining an interleaved film with the hot\u000d\u000a      compaction process. This breakthrough widened the window of processing\u000d\u000a      temperatures to a commercially acceptable value and increased the\u000d\u000a      interlayer bond strength, which is enables greater commercial exploitation\u000d\u000a      by improving thermoformability of the hot compacted sheets [3]. This\u000d\u000a      latest patent extends the lifetime of the patent portfolio to 2029.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11780","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    CASTEP can be used to simulate a wide range of materials including\u000a      crystalline solids, surfaces, molecules, liquids and amorphous materials.\u000a      It can calculate the properties of any material that can be thought of as\u000a      an assembly of nuclei and electrons with the only limitation being the\u000a      finite speed and memory of computers systems [C1, see Fig 1].

Instead, density functional\u000a      theory is a much more powerful technique to solve many body problems in\u000a      quantum mechanics (winning the 1999 Nobel prize for Walter Kohn). This\u000a      gives the energy levels and wavefunction of the material, but the more\u000a      useful information is how it responds e.g. to light, phonons, neutrons etc\u000a      as this is directly measureable and has a direct connection to\u000a      applications for the material. Typically this response is determined by\u000a      the second derivative of the energy, which requires perturbative methods.\u000a      In the late 1990s there were existing codes which used the density\u000a      functional approach to calculate wavefunctions and energies, but these\u000a      were all developed for specific applications by multiple authors and were\u000a      not efficient enough to extend to perturbation theory. They were also\u000a      typically poorly documented, and difficult to port onto the new parallel\u000a      computing environments which were beginning to appear.\u000a    Prof Stewart Clark (member of Durham Physics Department 1997-present),\u000a      together with a small group of theoretical condensed matter physicists,\u000a      decided that the lack of efficient computational tools was a serious\u000a      barrier to their research and that they should build a new code from the\u000a      ground up. Their code was fundamentally designed to run on parallel\u000a      machines, and be fully documented so that additional functionality could\u000a      easily be incorporated by external researchers as well as the authors. The\u000a      original CASTEP Developers Group consisted of Stewart Clark (Durham), Phil\u000a      Hasnip, Mike Payne and Chris Pickard (Cambridge), Matt Probert (York) and\u000a      Matt Segall (now in industry). While these are all credited as equal\u000a      co-authors, Prof Clark's contribution included development of the new,\u000a      efficient computational implementation of the density functional theory\u000a      which forms the heart of the CASTEP code [1-2]. He also developed a new,\u000a      much more computationally efficient way to solve the non-local\u000a      interactions between electrons [3], which he has recently updated [4].\u000a    The first public release of CASTEP was in 2001, and Prof Clark\u000a      immediately used this to tackle his research problems, including how to\u000a      circumvent the miniaturization limit for transistors. Standard silicon\u000a      dioxide materials hit a quantum limit below 22 nm as electrons start to\u000a      tunnel through the transistor gate so the device is no longer a reliable\u000a      switch. Prof Clark used CASTEP to calculate the properties of numerous\u000a      alternative semiconductor materials, and showed that quantum tunnelling\u000a      was much less of an issue for Halfnium dioxide, so chips made using this\u000a      material could be made much smaller [5]. The same year, Intel\u000a      independently released its first chip based on Halfnium dioxide,\u000a      demonstrating that this did indeed allow miniaturization as predicted by\u000a      CASTEP.\u000a    Another research project was with multi-ferroic materials. In general,\u000a      materials can be either ferro-magnetic or ferro-electric but not both as\u000a      ferro-magnetism occurs when spin degeneracy is lifted by pushing electrons\u000a      to unfilled states, whereas ferro-electric materials push electrons\u000a      towards filled states so the two are generally mutually exclusive.\u000a      However, a very small number of materials do show both, and these are very\u000a      important both for the intriguing science underlying the phenomena, and\u000a      the exciting potential of devices where both the magnetic and charge\u000a      properties can be controlled. Of these, BiFeO3 is one of the\u000a      few to exhibit this behaviour at room temperature, as required for device\u000a      applications. Prof Clark was able to use CASTEP to explain how the\u000a      electronic structure of BiFeO3 allowed this to happen. This\u000a      fundamental understanding of the underlying physics is a prerequisite to\u000a      precise control of the behaviour of the material in spintronics (magnetic\u000a      switching) devices [6].\u000a    CASTEP can also tackle fundamental issues in biology such as the topology\u000a      of molecular networks. These are extremely difficult to calculate but\u000a      critically determine all the material properties, including chemical\u000a      bonding and crystallization. Prof Clark was able to use CASTEP's accurate\u000a      electronic structure calculations to predict the three major crystalline\u000a      structures of glycine, the first amino acid for which this was possible,\u000a      and to show that another could exist at higher pressure [7].\u000a    The Developers Group continuously update the code to add functionality\u000a      such as modules to calculate the results of Raman spectroscopy and nuclear\u000a      magnetic resonances. This makes the code a unique resource, allowing\u000a      communication and collaboration between experimentalists and theorists, in\u000a      both industry and academia, increasing its impact and scope significantly.\u000a    Over 4000 peer-reviewed publications across a wide range of disciplines\u000a      have used the code. It is also used in training highly skilled graduate\u000a      students, many of whom have gone on to work in industry. Several hundred\u000a      PhD theses from 2002 to the present have been based on calculations using\u000a      CASTEP, contributing to the large number of scientific papers published in\u000a      leading peer reviewed international journals.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11781","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cross and Freeman had very early realised that there were multiple\u000a      commercial uses within the surface science and biophysics communities of\u000a      this new, very sensitive measurement device. They co-founded Farfield\u000a      Sensors in 1997, and filed patents for the original design ideas [P1-P2].\u000a      By 2002 they had developed this into a commercial product, the AnaLight\u000a      Bio200, a Dual Polarization Interferometer (DPI) for the measurement of\u000a      real-time structural change in molecular systems [C1]. This won the\u000a      National Physical Laboratory National Measurement Award 2003 for\u000a      Innovation in Measurement, recognising Farfield's technical innovation and\u000a      impact on current industrial metrology, as well as a suite of other awards\u000a      [C2]. The company moved to purpose built premises in Crewe [C1], and in\u000a      2008 they launched a second generation instrument design, the AnaLight 4D\u000a      which could quantify the degree of order and disruption in lipid bilayers\u000a      as well as measure molecular dimensions and density on surfaces. This new\u000a      tool generated substantial interest and the company doubled its turnover\u000a      in 2008, having its best year ever [C3]. It extended its customer base to\u000a      17 countries, recruiting a new Far East agent and a new member of the core\u000a      scientific staff [C1].\u000a    Two of the machines were bought by P&amp;G, a US company with $80Billlion\u000a      turnover in consumer products. An example project was to test different\u000a      dishwasher detergents for their rinse time. A faster rinse reduces the\u000a      water usage, leading to environmental gains, but the detergent needs to be\u000a      completely removed in order to leave glasses `squeaky clean', a criteria\u000a      which is especially important in Japan. P&amp;G used the DPI to\u000a      characterise the maximum surface layer of detergent required for it to be\u000a      classed as `squeaky clean' (the first reliable automated predictive test\u000a      for this), and so were able to develop faster rinse formulations. The\u000a      Analytical GCO, P&amp;G Newcastle, identified the impact to the company `As\u000a        a result, 2 head counts in Product Design were freed up to do other\u000a        work. More importantly, the insights gained via understanding the phase\u000a        behaviour at interfaces explains why some formulations rinse off more\u000a        slowly than others...faster rinsing formulations for Japan Joy have been\u000a        identified and launched in the market and keep our business in Japan\u000a        growing.' [C4]\u000a    Applications in biophysics include drug discovery and development as the\u000a      instrument is sensitive enough to track the response of a protein to a\u000a      potential drug in real time and without any additional tagging of the\u000a      molecules which could disrupt the response. Farfield was a partner in the\u000a      3 year European FP7 program ASMENA (2008-11) to develop new platforms for\u000a      drug screening and analytical profiling based on in vitro measurements of\u000a      the functional and conformal change in membrane proteins [C5]. Similar\u000a      pan-European projects include the SABIO collaboration to develop a\u000a      diagnostic test for Hepititis A, B and C [C6], and the INTOPSENS project,\u000a      funded under the FP7 HealthCompetence programme, to demonstrate a compact\u000a      polymer and silicon-based CMOS-compatible photonics sensor system for a\u000a      rapid diagnostic test for sepsis at `point of care' [C7]. They are also\u000a      part of the NEURASYNC network to study Parkinson's disease (PD). This is\u000a      the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized\u000a      pathologically by the accumulation of aggregated conformations of the\u000a      presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein. Farfield's role was to use the\u000a      AnaLight DPI for state of the art in vitro assays with biomarkers and\u000a      experimental therapeutics targeting alpha-synuclein [C8].\u000a    In 2009, the company took its sensor fabrication to Inex, at\u000a      Newcastle-upon-Tyne in order to move from a 4\" to a 6\" process and it\u000a      extended its range of chip surfaces. It was accepted into the North West\u000a      England High Growth business support programme. There was expansion of\u000a      bioscience-based sales activity in the form of a co-marketing agreement\u000a      with IdentiGen in Germany and the customer base extending to 19 countries\u000a      with first-time installations in Korea and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u000a      [C1]. The company took on a new postdoc in 2010 and launched the Farfield\u000a      AnaLight 4D Workstation, allowing combined studies of affinity,\u000a      kinetics, conformation and thermodynamics of biomolecules (Fig 4 [C9]).\u000a\u000a\u0009  Fig 3: AnaLight 4D workstation\u000a\u0009  \u000a    However, the worsening economic climate brought difficulties for the\u000a      company and it was bought out in April 2010 by the publically quoted\u000a      Swedish scientific instrument supplier Biolin Scientific, who acquired all\u000a      existing shares in the Farfield Group for &#163;2.5M [C10]. Farfield continued\u000a      to market and sell under the Farfield brand worldwide, remaining a\u000a      separate product company within the Biolin organisation. All Farfield\u000a      staff were retained after the acquisition [C10] and, indeed, three new\u000a      core staff, a Product development Manager, a Business development Manager\u000a      and an application specialist, were subsequently recruited [C11].\u000a      Iberlaser SA took on representation of Farfield in Spain, and Farfield\u000a      relocated to new premises at Manchester Airport with improved laboratory\u000a      and training facilities. Automation was enhanced during the year with the\u000a      Dual Plate Autosampler, the customer base expanded to 20 countries, and\u000a      Biolin Inc, the US division of Biolin, took on a new post-doctoral\u000a      scientist to support the Dual Polarisation Interferometry. However, Biolin\u000a      took the strategic decision to discontinue the manufacture and sales of\u000a      the Dual Polarisation Interferometer on December 30th 2011, though the\u000a      company has made the commitment to support existing customers up till the\u000a      end of December 2016 [C12].\u000a    Despite its demise, the instrument nevertheless has made a significant\u000a      contribution to biosensing and the surface science sectors, and there\u000a      remain scores of instruments in use around the world.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research in Durham Physics Department on optical waveguides was used to\u000a      build a novel interferometer which can measure real time changes in\u000a      dimension and density of a thin film adsorbed on a sensor chip.

He was using the change in polymer conductivity to measure the\u000a      amount of gas absorbed, but found that this was neither sensitive nor\u000a      robust. Instead, he wanted to try to use the change in refractive index of\u000a      the polymer to trace the gas absorption. Interferometry is the most\u000a      sensitive way to measure the change in any optical property and Dr Cross's\u000a      waveguide work immediately suggested a practical experimental technique.\u000a      Dr Cross designed a system where each waveguide was a water absorbing\u000a      polymer, separated by an insulating layer of water impervious polyolefin,\u000a      all mounted on a layer of glass. Each waveguide disperses the light at the\u000a      end, so they act as a Young's slit experiment. As the upper layer is\u000a      exposed to water vapour, its refractive index changes and the phase of the\u000a      light in the upper waveguide changes relative to that in the lower\u000a      reference beam. This offset in the interference fringes in the far field\u000a      (hence the company name) gives a very sensitive and robust way to measure\u000a      the amount of water vapour absorbed onto the top polymer, to the extent\u000a      that it could be followed in real time [1].\u000a    The initial device was specific to water as the polymer would not\u000a      necessarily absorb other substances of interest. However, Dr Cross\u000a      realised that the idea could be extended to any material as the light\u000a      field is not wholly confined within the waveguide but decays exponentially\u000a      away from the boundary. This part of the optical field, known as the\u000a      evanescent (vanishing) field, will interact with any ultra-thin film of\u000a      material placed on top of the upper waveguide via exciting bound or\u000a      partially bound optical modes. The interaction alters the speed of\u000a      propagation (\"phase velocity\") in the sensing waveguide relative to the\u000a      lower reference waveguide, again giving an offset to the interference\u000a      fringes. This meant that the polymer materials were not required at all\u000a      for the waveguides, and more robust structures could be built from silicon\u000a      oxy-nitride. (Fig 1, [2]).\u000a\u0009  \u000a\u0009  Fig 1 Schematic design for the instrument with silicon oxynitride layer waveguides\u000a\u0009  \u000a\u0009  \u0009  \u000a\u0009  Fig 2: Change in response with polarization state\u000a\u0009  \u000a    However, Dr Cross also realised that the optical modes excited by the\u000a      evanescent wave interaction are different for different polarization\u000a      modes, and this difference can be used to derive the absolute thickness of\u000a      the ultra-thin layer (Fig 2). The final design then includes a\u000a      ferroelectric liquid crystal rotator between the illuminating laser and\u000a      waveguide stack to act as a switchable half wave plate. The two\u000a      polarization measures are taken at a typical rate of 50Hz, tracking\u000a      thickness of the layer on timescales of 20ms [2]. Fast tracking of\u000a      changing shape is especially important for biomolecules, as the shape of\u000a      proteins is as important as their chemical composition in determining\u000a      their characteristics. This paper demonstrated the technique by measuring\u000a      the thickness of an adsorbed layer of the rigid protein streptavidin as it\u000a      developed in real time [2].\u000a    The techniques are equally important in surface science applications. The\u000a      team used a thin film of tetraethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E14),\u000a      a well characterized non-ionic surfactant which is commonly used in\u000a      industrial formulations, and showed that the adsorbed layer thickness\u000a      increases as the surfactant concentration increases. This suggests that\u000a      the surfactant molecules adopt a prone attitude at low concentrations,\u000a      resulting in thin, relatively dense layer coverage, changing to a more\u000a      upright stance at higher concentrations. This is in good agreement with\u000a      previous neutron reflection results [3]. The sensitivity is such that it\u000a      can also be used to follow the surface changes during formation of a layer\u000a      of liquid crystal [4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11782","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A recent report from the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on\u000d\u000a      organised crime across the Asia-Pacific region estimated that the market\u000d\u000a      in counterfeit goods is worth $24.4 billion i.e. about 2% of world trade,\u000d\u000a      and that it is as profitable for criminal gangs as the trade in illegal\u000d\u000a      drugs [C1].

Russell Cowburn joined this group\u000d\u000a      as a lecturer in October 2000, and worked on characterising these\u000d\u000a      fluctuations in magnetic structures as a prerequisite to controlling them\u000d\u000a      [e.g. 1].

An individual sheet of paper could be identified by its speckle pattern after being mixed back\u000d\u000a      into the full ream from which it was taken. This pattern is also very\u000d\u000a      stable as it depends solely on the topography of the fibres (Fig 3).

They developed both transmission (QC-TT) and\u000d\u000areflection (QC-RT) geometry systems (Fig 4), but the smaller footprint (and hence lower price) of\u000d\u000athe QC-RT system makes it more attractive. Prior to this, potential customers had resisted\u000d\u000apurchase of such tools on the grounds that the instruments revealed edge defects from handling\u000d\u000abut were incapable of determining which defects were critical and which were benign.

It is estimated by the industry body,\u000d\u000aSEMATECH, that for every silicon fabrication line producing 20,000 300mm or 50,000 200 mm\u000d\u000awafers per month, the cost of catastrophic wafer failure during high temperature processing is $2M\u000d\u000aper annum at the 180nm node, rising to over $25M per annum at the 47nm node [C5]. The cost\u000d\u000acontinues to rise as the inverse square of the node size.

Most studies\u000d\u000aof fractures rely predominantly on a statistical\u000d\u000aapproach, and the few attempts at a deterministic\u000d\u000amodel suggest that crack length is a key parameter,\u000d\u000abut that other factors such as location and the\u000d\u000adetailed form of the applied stress were also\u000d\u000aimportant. This has commercial applications in\u000d\u000asemiconductor manufacturing, where catastrophic\u000d\u000asilicon wafer breakage during high temperature \u000d\u000aprocessing is an increasingly expensive hazard (Fig \u000d\u000a1). Most silicon wafers show damage due to\u000d\u000ahandling in the manufacturing process, yet only a few of these propagate to cause catastrophic\u000d\u000afailure during rapid thermal annealing, so it is not economic to simply remove all damaged wafers.\u000d\u000aWhat is required is a way to distinguish which cracks are critical and which are benign.\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000a\u0009  Fig 1. Catastrophic fracture of a 200mm diameter silicon wafer\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000aPhysically, a crack will propagate where the opening stress on the crack is larger than the back\u000d\u000astress at its tip, but neither of these quantities can be measured easily from standard images. In\u000d\u000aJanuary 2008, a research consortium led by Durham University, and coordinated by Professor\u000d\u000aBrian Tanner of the Physics Department, began work to develop a method of predicting which\u000d\u000awafers were at risk using X-ray Diffraction Imaging (XRDI, also known as X-ray topography) to\u000d\u000aassess the damage due to handling on the wafers. Unlike normal imaging, XRDI measures the\u000d\u000aresidual strain on the material as a diffraction image is sensitive to the change in lattice plane\u000d\u000aspacing.\u000d\u000aThe international consortium included both academic (Durham, Freiburg, Dublin City and\u000d\u000aNavarra Universities) and industrial partners, funded under a &#8364;2M European Commission\u000d\u000aFramework 7 ICT project, `Investigation of Silicon wafer damage in manufacturing processes'\u000d\u000a(SIDAM) [1] ran from 2008-2011. It was strongly supported by major semiconductor companies,\u000d\u000awith an advisory board which included representatives from Intel, MEMC, Siltronic and AMD\u000d\u000a(Global Foundaries). The SME industrial partner was Bede Scientific Instruments Ltd., a 30 year-\u000d\u000aold spin-out from Durham University Physics Department that had floated as Bede plc on the\u000d\u000aLondon Stock Exchange in 2000. This was acquired by the Israeli company Jordan Valley\u000d\u000aSemiconductors in April 2008 and rebranded as its new UK subsidiary, Jordan Valley\u000d\u000aSemiconductors (UK) Ltd. This took the place of Bede Scientific in the consortium.\u000d\u000aBy working closely with advisory board members, the consortium established that misaligned\u000d\u000ahandling tools generated cracks at the edge of Si wafers. The team were able to reproduce this\u000d\u000apattern of cracking in a controlled manner using nano-indentation close to the wafer edge. These\u000d\u000a`control' wafers were studied at high resolution using the XRDI at the Diamond Light Source (see\u000d\u000aFig 2 and [2]). The key research breakthrough was in 2011, led by Prof Tanner of Durham\u000d\u000aUniversity, where he showed that the crack propagation condition could be simply assessed as the\u000d\u000alength of the crack was a measure of the opening stress, while the width of the crack tip on the\u000d\u000aXRDI measures the back stress [3]. Cracks with a small length to image width ratio are benign;\u000d\u000athose with a large length to image width are highly likely to lead to fracture. This condition can be\u000d\u000aused predict whether a crack will or will not propagate under specific thermal processing conditions\u000d\u000a(see Fig 3).

In June 2011, Kromek and Nova held 34\u000d\u000a      granted patents. In February 2013, Kromek acquired Endicott Interconnect\u000d\u000a      Detection and Imaging Systems (EIDS), based in Saxonburg, PA, USA in a\u000d\u000a      strategic move to consolidate the market in melt-grown CdZnTe material.\u000d\u000a      This acquisition added another 40 staff, 25 patents and 300 trade secrets\u000d\u000a      to the Kromek Group. EIDS is now trading again as eV Products [C4].\u000d\u000a    Initially the company explored applications in the medical imaging market\u000d\u000a      where there are multiple applications for colour X-ray imaging.

Supported by the UK\u000d\u000a      Home Office and its investors, the company incorporated their detectors\u000d\u000a      into X-ray systems for liquid explosive detection. In 2008 (the same year\u000d\u000a      it was awarded the ISO2001 manufacturing quality stamp) it launched a\u000d\u000a      bottle scanner which can deal with individual containers. The system, now\u000d\u000a      in use at airports around the world, has a direct impact on all airline\u000d\u000a      passengers as it allows duty free liquids to be carried through airport\u000d\u000a      security screens [C6].

He had a longstanding interest in CdTe and CdZnTe, which\u000d\u000a      form the basis of energy sensitive X-(CdTe) and gamma-ray (CdZnTe)\u000d\u000a      detectors, and can also be used as substrates for thermal imaging devices.\u000d\u000a      However, commercial applications of these were limited by problems in\u000d\u000a      growing large crystals. Standard melt growth processes only produce wafers\u000d\u000a      less than 2 inches in diameter, whereas medical imaging applications\u000d\u000a      require larger area detectors. While these can be made by butting several\u000d\u000a      smaller crystals together, this is uneconomic as the cost scales with the\u000d\u000a      number of crystals rather than their size.\u000d\u000a    Prof Brinkman (in collaboration with Profs Tanner (Durham Physics\u000d\u000a      1973-present) and Durose (Durham Physics 1992-2011) led a BRITE-EURAM\u000d\u000a      grant (1994-1997), with major academic partners including the Universities\u000d\u000a      of Freiburg: Germany, Athens: Greece and Ancona: Italy) to explore and\u000d\u000a      develop methods to improve the growth of CdTe. He realised that vapour\u000d\u000a      growth was not subject to the same size limitations as melt growth\u000d\u000a      processes, but the resulting material was largely polycrystalline as the\u000d\u000a      crystal growth was disrupted by the heat from the vapour source. The key\u000d\u000a      breakthrough in growing high perfection single crystals was made by Dr\u000d\u000a      John Mullins, a postdoc working with Prof Brinkman in Durham, funded by\u000d\u000a      the BRITE-EURAM grant. He realised that the vapour source and deposition\u000d\u000a      region could be thermally decoupled by using a bent tube rather than a\u000d\u000a      straight tube, so that the growing crystal was not heated directly by the\u000d\u000a      source. The first high quality CdTe crystals were grown using this\u000d\u000a      technique in 1997, and the process was patented in 1998 [P1]. The first\u000d\u000a      results were published in a peer reviewed journal in 1999 [1], with a full\u000d\u000a      description of the growth system in 2000 [2].\u000d\u000a    Research on this technique continued with &#163;0.17M grant support from EPSRC\u000d\u000a      (2000-2003). The potential of the process became increasingly clear, and\u000d\u000a      development of this into a commercial product was supported by a &#163;0.15M\u000d\u000a      PPARC PIPPS grant (2005-2006) and &#163;0.93M from a DTI basic technology award\u000d\u000a      via EPSRC (2006-2010). This work culminated in 2007 with the\u000d\u000a      heteroepitaxial growth of the first high perfection wafers of CdTe with\u000d\u000a      good electrical qualities, using GaAs as the substrate [e.g. 3-5]. By 2009\u000d\u000a      they could scale this up to grow 4 inch diameter crystals of CdTe, and in\u000d\u000a      2011 succeeded in making similarly large crystals of CdZnTe [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11785","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research by Prof Bloor was key to the initial patenting and has\u000a      continued to provide the company with academic support for its claims,\u000a      thereby strengthening its' position to negotiate start- up finance and\u000a      attract potential customers. Mr Lussey, in an web interview, says `That\u000a        University connection started Peratech' [C1].\u000a    Peratech first used the QTC coating for textile switches and sensors, but\u000a      it became apparent that an ink version of QTC would have great potential\u000a      as ink printing is a much more efficient and hence cheaper way to make\u000a      structures coated with the material. Mr Lussey was able to make a pressure\u000a      sensitive ink from a standard ink base but with semiconductor coated\u000a      Titanium dioxide particles rather than Nickel as the QTC particles.\u000a      However, he could not develop this further without a basic understanding\u000a      of its properties. Dr Del Atkinson at Durham worked on the\u000a      micro-morphology of the ink, again using the scanning electron microscopy\u000a      facilities in Durham to show the structural properties of the new\u000a      material. Here the key aspect was that the nanoparticles were needle-like\u000a      rods, so the electric field enhanced quantum tunnelling occurred between\u000a      the tips of the rods, again giving the strong dependence of conductivity\u000a      on applied pressure [6]. This opaque QTC ink coating is now the subject of\u000a      licence agreements with major international companies e.g. Nissha\u000a      printing, one of the worlds' largest manufacturer of touch screen\u000a      technology. Nissha signed a $1.4M licence agreement with Peratech to use\u000a      QTC technology to create the next generation of touch screens with 3D\u000a      input (x,y position and pressure) for mobile phones and portable\u000a      electronic devices. The licensing agreement gives Nissha exclusive\u000a      worldwide rights to use the technology for screens smaller than 3.5 inches\u000a      by 5.5 inches for an initial period of one year [C2]. This success\u000a      attracted &#163;1.1M funding from YFM, a company which invests in SMEs across\u000a      the UK [C3].\u000a    The opacity of the standard QTC ink means it has to be printed underneath\u000a      the screen, with backplane electronics behind this to detect position and\u000a      pressure. Peratech initially used commercial solutions for these\u000a      electronics, but now has its own design office in Korea which produces\u000a      electrode and backplane designs as well as firmware and software\u000a      especially for QTC. Peratech has used these facilities to develop its own\u000a      customised touch processing unit [C4].\u000a    However, the focus of recent development work has been instead to design\u000a      a transparent QTC ink which can be printed on the front of a screen. This\u000a      is much simpler to incorporate in the manufacturing process, as it means\u000a      that the printing is directly onto the flat screen substrate [C5]. New\u000a      readout electronics designs for transparent multi-touch sensors are being\u000a      developed that span the entire screen, giving full pressure sensing at all\u000a      positions simultaneously. Peratech is now working with the Centre for\u000a      Process Innovation (CPI) Plastic Electronics Technology Center on NETPark\u000a      to explore printing QTC screens, sensors and switches using standard\u000a      printing machines. This gives a major reduction in production costs\u000a      compared to the previous approach where Peratech used a screen-printing\u000a      process. The project will also allow the integration of QTC devices with\u000a      other forms of printable electronics. This joint project is supported by\u000a      government funding from the Technology Strategy Board [C6].\u000a    While the market for pressure sensitive inks is very large, there are\u000a      also smaller niche markets for more general pressure sensitive materials.\u000a      The properties of the QTC&#8482; material means that it can detect multiple\u000a      gestures and functions, responding instantly to contact in a similar way\u000a      to human skin. This has applications in robotics, with Peratech\u000a      commissioned by NASA to build the hand\/glove sensor for Robonaut, a\u000a      humanoid robot to work in space alongside astronauts [C7].

Mr Lussey, working as an\u000a      independent technologist on a security contract, was trying to make a\u000a      conducting adhesive for an anti-theft device. He mixed nickel powder with\u000a      clear silicone (bathroom sealant); it was insulating but became conductive\u000a      under applied pressure. Pressure sensitivity opens a whole new dimension\u000a      in the human-machine interface, as the resistance depends on the applied\u000a      force e.g for games consoles in gauging the level of response. Mr Lussey\u000a      founded a company, Peratech, to commercialise this material, but wanted a\u000a      fundamental understanding of the origin of its unusual behaviour.\u000a    Collaborative research between Bloor and Lussey at Durham showed that the\u000a      material changed gradually from an electrical insulator to a metal-like\u000a      conductor over a large range in applied pressure. This provided the key\u000a      results for the patent on the material [1], and is in strong contrast with\u000a      the behaviour of conventional composites which switch from insulator to\u000a      conductor over a very small range. The conventional composites consist of\u000a      spherical conducting particles (either metals or carbon) embedded in a\u000a      polymer, and contact between the particles is required in order to create\u000a      a conduction path. Hence the material is either an insulator when the\u000a      particles are not in contact, or a conductor when they are. The very\u000a      different behaviour of the new material led Peratech to sponsor a CASE PhD\u000a      studentship (Hands) in Durham Physics Department to better understand the\u000a      structure which gave rise to this behaviour. The key research breakthrough\u000a      came when a sample was taken to the Scanning Electron Microscope in\u000a      Durham. These pictures revealed that the Nickel particles were spiky\u000a      rather than smooth, immediately pinpointing the origin of the unique\u000a      conduction properties as electric field enhanced Quantum Tunnelling. With\u000a      no applied pressure, the Nickel particles were separated from each other\u000a      by the silicone rubber, so the material was an insulator. Under pressure\u000a      the particles get closer but do not touch as they are completely covered\u000a      (wetted) by the silicone. In `normal' quantum tunnelling applications, the\u000a      particles have to be nanometers apart for the tunnelling current to be\u000a      detectable. However, the spikes on the Nickel surface allow a large\u000a      electric field to build up at their tips (Fig 1). This decreases the\u000a      effective width of the potential barrier in quantum tunnelling, thus\u000a      increasing the distance at which the quantum tunnelling current can be\u000a      detected to 20-30nm. The current increases as the particles are forced\u000a      closer together, giving a very sensitive dependence on the applied\u000a      pressure. The unique properties of this Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC)\u000a      were outlined in a paper by Bloor et al 2005 [2] in the Journal of Applied\u000a      Physics, which was selected as one of the top 25 research papers in this\u000a      Journal for this year\u000a    \u000a      Fig 1: Comparison of shapes of conventional composite (left)\u000a        and\u000a        QTC (right)\u000a    \u000a    More details of the material were published in [3], and its application\u000a      to vapour sensing in [4-5]. This also opened up a new field of design of\u000a      other composite materials whose conduction properties are controlled by\u000a      quantum tunnelling [6]. These provide pressure sensitivity in touch\u000a      sensitive device including screens, keyboards, controls and switches\u000a      giving an extra dimension to the response compared to current touch\u000a      sensitive screens which only detect position.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11786","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The aim of the TOPLESS (2007-2010) project was to develop the materials\u000a      and device architectures to the point where they were demonstrably\u000a      commercialisable [C1]. Durham's research contribution to this was to\u000a      greatly increase the efficiency of polymer white light production [1-5],\u000a      and two of these key breakthroughs are the subjects of patents filed by\u000a      Thorn [P2-P3]. By 2009 the consortium could build the most efficient\u000a      polymer solid state lighting panels ever made, with performance\u000a      approaching that of current industry standard, mercury vapour based,\u000a      fluorescent lighting units. However, the OLEDs are safer, easier to\u000a      recycle and more environmentally sustainable, because they contain no\u000a      mercury. This was recognised by the TOPLESS project winning the\u000a      Environmental category of the Technology &amp; Innovation Awards of The\u000a        Engineer [C2].\u000a\u0009 In an interview with Prof Geoff Williams, the TOPLESS\u000a      project manager who gained his PhD from Durham University, then working in\u000a      Thorn Lighting said \"The University of Durham ...have the ability,\u000a        within their photo-physics group to understand precise charge transfer\u000a        within the polymers, this is a valuable to feedback tool for the\u000a        development of the next generation of materials.\" [C3].\u000a     These successes demonstrated that the devices would be commercially competitive\u000a      if a fabrication process could be developed which was economic yet gave\u000a      high quality, reproducible results. Initial work from TOPLESS demonstrated\u000a      that slot dye coating, a form of meniscus printing onto a glass substrate,\u000a      could be used to produce the ultrathin, uniform polymer films over the\u000a      large areas required. However, this prototype production method needed to\u000a      be scaled up to in order to form the basis of an industrial manufacturing\u000a      process. To do this, the original TOPLESS consortium was expanded, with\u000a      new industrial partners including Pilkington Glass (for the substrate),\u000a      Cambridge Inkjet Technology (to print bus bars on the anodes of the OLEDs)\u000a      and Tridonic (a sister company of Thorn, again based in the NE, to make\u000a      all the electronic controls for the lighting). These industrial partners\u000a      form the basis of a complete supply chain to incorporate the material into\u000a      commercial units. The development of a full manufacturing process from\u000a      this was supported by a &#163;4M grant (TOPDRAWER: 2010-2013) from the\u000a      Technology Strategy Board (sponsored by BIS) [C4]. The first commercially\u000a      available units are expected in 2015, but `concept' design units are\u000a      included in an OLED lighting installation in the entrance of the Thorne\u000a      Spennymoor plant (Fig 1:C5).\u000a  \u0009  \u000a\u0009  Fig 1. Concept design for OLED lighting on display at Thorn Spennymoor entrance [C5].\u000a\u0009  \u0009  \u000a    While the TOPDRAWER grant covers the research and development costs, the\u000a    full scale industrial process also requires specialist infrastructure. The\u000a    TOPLESS consortium designed a pre-production line for manufacture of solid\u000a    state lighting, costed at &#163;4.5M. This was funded by BIS and ERDF as part of\u000a    a much wider &#163;20.5M package of support for plastic electronics in the UK.\u000a    The equipment was installed at the national Centre for Plastic Electronics\u000a    (PETEC), based at NETPark (the Universities technology incubator start up\u000a    site) in Sedgefield in early 2011, greatly expanding the regional\u000a    infrastructure for plastic electronics, providing 26 new jobs at PETEC with\u000a    the aim of stimulating 250 jobs regionally and 1500 nationally [C6].\u000a  The Managing Director of County Durham Development Company, the\u000a      organisation which runs NETPark, credits the collaboration with Durham\u000a      University with rescuing 600 jobs at the Thorn Spennymoor site after the\u000a      company proposed to move its operation to Romania. \"When Thorn\u000a        Lighting's operation in the County faced the threat of relocation to\u000a        Eastern Europe we helped convince the company's leaders to stay and\u000a        invest &#163;24 million in a new facility. The new plant at Spennymoor\u000a        safeguarded 600 jobs and created new R&amp;D posts.\" [C7]. The\u000a      Director of Innovation Development at CDDC said \"It would have ripped\u000a        the heart out of Spennymoor had they gone, so we told them they really\u000a        shouldn't do that because they would lose their market leadership in the\u000a        UK. We told them, if you are into lighting then you will be interested\u000a        in the solid state lighting which is being done at Durham University and\u000a        commercialised here at PETEC. Thorn decided after six months of\u000a        persuasion and negotiation that not only would they stay, but they would\u000a        build a new factory with &#163;24M of their own money.\" [C8]\u000a    While the University research was key in discovering and developing the\u000a      new material, the commercialization of the OLEDs to a full lighting\u000a      product was only possible with major multibillion pound industrial\u000a      partners [C9]. The University-Industry consortium funded by TOPLESS led to\u000a      especially strong links between the Physics Department and Thorn Lighting,\u000a      the largest lighting manufacturing employer in the North East. Research\u000a      staff from Thorn were seconded to Durham as part of the TOPLESS project\u000a      (Kamtekar, Goudin). They joined the University postdocs already working on\u000a      the material (Lyons, Dias, Vaughan, Jankus, Perepichka, now a Lecturer at\u000a      UCLan, Tavasli: now a lecturer at Uludag, University, Turkey, Siddle, now\u000a      working for a NE chemical company). Thorn and CDT also now co-sponsors an\u000a      EPSRC grant, while CDT have co-sponsored Dias on a 5 year Fellowship in\u000a      the Physics Department. All these links mean that the Knowledge Transfer\u000a      from the project is on-going. CDT-Sumitomo now routinely use the new\u000a      material characterisation techniques developed in the TOPLESS project,\u000a      buying the equipment to replicate the process on their own site in\u000a      Cambridge [C10]. CDT Chief Technology Officer says \"they continue to\u000a        value the contribution from Durham and because of that have entered into\u000a        OLAE+ [Organic and Large Area Electronics] EU funded project with Durham\u000a        and other institutions\" [C10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Interdisciplinary research on a new class of organo-metallic light\u000a      emitting polymers showed that they could produce white light very\u000a      efficiently.

In Durham there is a longstanding\u000a      research collaboration to develop new organic light emitting diodes\u000a      (OLEDs), split between Physics (led by Prof Monkman, member of the\u000a      Department from 1988-present) and Chemistry (led by Prof Bryce, member of\u000a      Chemistry from 1984-present). These devices generally emit over a narrow\u000a      band in wavelength, given by the energy of the electron-hole recombination\u000a      band gap in the material. Most polymers are hole transporting, so their\u000a      light output is greatly enhanced by combining them with an electron-rich\u000a      material. Monkman and Bryce set out in 2005 to synthesise a new electron\u000a      transporting polymer to combine with the standard OLED polymers in order\u000a      to increase efficiency of light production. Their new material did indeed\u000a      have a higher electron mobility, but also had the unexpected property that\u000a      the holes and electrons recombined into two energy levels rather than one.\u000a      This dual emission results in a much broader wavelength spectrum than\u000a      standard OLEDs [1-2]. Thus instead of having narrow band light from a\u000a      composite of two different polymers, they had a single material which\u000a      produced broadband (white) light. The patent for this process was filed in\u000a      2007 [P1].\u000a    Bryce and Monkman won an EPSRC grant (2007-10) for research to understand\u000a      and improve the dual emission properties of the polymer with applications\u000a      in lighting. This work led by Monkman and Bryce and resulted in an outline\u000a      of the key properties of the material [3-4].\u000a    In parallel with this, Monkman and Bryce also approached the CEO of\u000a      Zumtoble, the parent company of Thorn Lighting (one of the largest\u000a      manufacturing employers in the NE). They saw the potential of this\u000a      material, and set up a consortium comprising the University, Thorn\u000a      Lighting and Cambridge Design Technology (CDT - the European research arm\u000a      of Sumitomo Chemicals, who are one of the largest chemical companies in\u000a      the world and the major international patent holder for polymer research).\u000a      This consortium won a &#163;4.3M grant (TOPLESS: 2007-2010) from the DTI to\u000a      develop the materials and device architecture to the point where they\u000a      could demonstrate a commercially viable product. This work resulted in\u000a      further papers in academic, peer reviewed journals on research to improve\u000a      the efficiency of the polymeric white light material, including a major\u000a      research breakthrough on understanding the multiple fundamental mechanisms\u000a      by which electron and hole are converted into light in the device [5].\u000a      This has opened the way to ab initio calculations of the\u000a      efficiency of light production in new materials, so that the next\u000a      generation of OLEDs can be designed to be even more efficient.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11787","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3617476","Name":"Nicaragua"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe diamond machining facility was established in 2006 as part of the CfAI research\u000d\u000aprogramme on precision instrumentation for large telescopes. However, the commercial\u000d\u000aapplications of this unique facility were soon apparent, and it has been available as a specialist\u000d\u000aservice to industry since 2008. Over 20 companies have placed contracts worth ~&#163;2.0M over the\u000d\u000apast 5 years of operation [C1] for high precision optical and micro-optical components for a range\u000d\u000aof applications including opthalmics, automotive optics, microstructures for backlit displays and IR\u000d\u000aoptics. Professor Robertson was awarded a Royal Society Industry Fellowship (2007-2010) in\u000d\u000arecognition of his work with industry in the field of diamond machining.\u000d\u000aA growing part of the market sector for precision optics is ophthalmic moulds. Typically plastic\u000d\u000aspectacle lenses have been produced by using thermosetting plastics cast in polished glass\u000d\u000amoulds. However, newer injection moulding techniques produce higher quality lenses, with higher\u000d\u000aaccuracy over a wider range in shape. This is a disruptive technology shift as the temperatures\u000d\u000arequired for injection moulding are not well matched to the thermal conductivity of the glass\u000d\u000amoulds. Instead, this requires metal moulds, for which diamond machining techniques are\u000d\u000aspecifically applicable. This is particularly true for progressive (freeform) moulds, where the\u000d\u000adiamond machined products produce lenses which are far superior in quality and shape to that of\u000d\u000atheir conventionally produced counterparts. CfAI have worked with several companies developing\u000d\u000aprototype moulds in Aluminium, then moving to medium wear production tooling in Nickel\u000d\u000aPhosphor plated moulds and are now producing hardened steel moulds using a specialized\u000d\u000amachining process. The steel mould lifetime is typically 10x longer than Nickel, which itself is 10x\u000d\u000alonger than Aluminum.\u000d\u000aOne example of the impact of this work is the collaboration with Pixel Optics, an ophthalmic\u000d\u000atechnology company based in Virginia, USA. They had the idea to make bifocals where the near\u000d\u000avision lens was based on a liquid crystal, so could be switched on and off when required so as to\u000d\u000aremove the reading zone distortion that is always present with standard bifocals or progressive (no\u000d\u000aline bifocal) lenses. They based their near vision zone on a Fresnel lens (see Fig 1) as these can\u000d\u000abe made much thinner than standard optics, and can be filled with a liquid crystal, whose refractive\u000d\u000aindex could be controlled electronically.\u000d\u000aThe electro-active lens technology, as it was subsequently called, was developed by The\u000d\u000aTechnology Partnership, based in Cambridge, UK who in turn contracted CfAI in 2009 to develop\u000d\u000athe diffractive lens manufacturing techniques. Through an 18 month, &#163;350,000 contract CfAI\u000d\u000adeveloped the capability to produce an elliptical Fresnel lens machined off axis of a spherical\u000d\u000astandard lens mould. This unique technique was key in enabling the electro-active lens production\u000d\u000aand was based on the Fast Tool Servo machining techniques developed in the earlier research\u000d\u000aprogramme for the machining of the IFU components [1-6].\u000d\u000aThe active eyewear containing the lenses is sold by Pixel Optics as the emPower! product\u000d\u000arange of spectacles (Fig 2), now selling in the United States for about $1,500 a pair [C2]. This was\u000d\u000alaunched at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2011, where it was highlighted as among the\u000d\u000a`Best of CES2011' by PC Magazine [C3]. These successes enabled the company to raise $45M in\u000d\u000afinancing for further development of the product. The Empower! Glasses won the extremely\u000d\u000aprestigious 2012 Gold Edison Award for Quality of Life for innovation and business [C4].

There are an\u000d\u000aestimated 670 million people (World Health Organisation) who live in the developing world with\u000d\u000apoor eyesight but without the glasses they need to be able to read due in the main to the lack of\u000d\u000aqualified practitioners able to test eyesight and prescribe corrective eyewear individually.\u000d\u000aEyejusters are a small company based in Oxford, UK that have developed a way to improve vision\u000d\u000aby designing spectacles that are adjustable. The principle behind this is that adjustable glasses\u000d\u000acan be made to accommodate the needs of a number of people with a range of prescriptions,\u000d\u000aallowing an individual wearer to change the power of the glasses for maximum clarity of vision.\u000d\u000aThis is achieved by sliding two (Alvarez) lenses with a very specific shape past each other. The\u000d\u000acombination acts as a single lens with a changing optical path as the lenses are moved with\u000d\u000arespect to one another i.e. varying optical power (Fig 3). However, the shape of these lenses is\u000d\u000aquite challenging to manufacture. Eyejusters are using the precision machining capabilities at CfAI\u000d\u000ato manufacture the lens masters, which are then reproduced in lightweight, resilient, cheap plastic.\u000d\u000aThese are assembled into glasses, with a dial to slide together two separate lenses until their\u000d\u000acombined focal power matches the corrective requirements of the wearers' eyes (Fig 4: C6). The\u000d\u000amethod, known as self-refraction, has been tested in several peer-reviewed studies [C7] and has\u000d\u000abeen the subject of fieldwork in Ghana, Nepal, Malawi, Nicaragua, China and South Africa. In\u000d\u000aMorocco, the company worked with Peace Corps volunteers, providing almost 800 pairs of glasses\u000d\u000ato young adults at 10 sites across the country [C8].\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aFig 3: Alvares lens giving variable optical paths\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aFig 4: Eyejusters, with dial to slide lenses\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aA facility for precision diamond machining of optical components arose from research at\u000d\u000aDurham University to produce instruments for large telescopes, including NASA's James Webb\u000d\u000aSpace telescope.

The Soft Matter Physics (SMP) group has\u000d\u000a      a long track record of fundamental studies on organic semiconductors and\u000d\u000a      has built significant knowledge based on their fabrication, testing and\u000d\u000a      optimisation.\u000d\u000a    The research underpinning the establishment of Ossila is based on work by\u000d\u000a      Professor David Lidzey and colleagues on the development and optimisation\u000d\u000a      of organic photovoltaic (OPV) and organic light-emitting devices (OLED).\u000d\u000a      In particular, EPSRC-funded research addressed the optimisation of OLED\u000d\u000a      devices based on semiconducting polymers. The motivation for this study\u000d\u000a      was to create a miniature, high-speed OLED device that could be used as\u000d\u000a      the basis of an organic laser-diode. As part of this work, a structure was\u000d\u000a      developed based on a glass sheet covered by a series of indium tin oxide\u000d\u000a      (anode) [ITO] pixels. When coated with a semiconducting polymer film and a\u000d\u000a      series of metal contacts, the device emitted efficient electroluminescence\u000d\u000a      at very high brightness [R1]. Using a pulsed drive scheme, it was\u000d\u000a      shown that such devices could act as communication elements by emitting\u000d\u000a      high-repetition rate optical pulses [R2, R3].

Subsequent work at Sheffield explored the\u000d\u000a      fabrication and optimisation of OPV devices [R5, R6], based on a\u000d\u000a      series of polymeric materials.

Eric Drexler. It\u000d\u000a      is this vision of nanotechnology as conventional engineering scaled down\u000d\u000a      to molecular scales that underlies popular tropes such as the idea of \"grey\u000a        goo\" and medical \"nanobots\".\u000d\u000a    2. Informing the public debate about nanotechnology in\u000d\u000a          consumer products\u000d\u000a    Jones's public engagement activities have been aimed at informing the\u000d\u000a      public debate on nanotechnology, presenting a balanced assessment of the\u000d\u000a      science while giving due weight to real risks and hazards, to help avoid a\u000d\u000a      consumer backlash similar to that observed with GM foods. One particularly\u000d\u000a      important theme has been the need to distinguish between engineering\u000d\u000a      nanoparticles and self-assembled nanoparticles (of the kind studied in\u000d\u000a      Jones's own research), which have quite different risk profiles. An\u000d\u000a      example of Jones's popular writing on nanotechnology setting this general\u000d\u000a      context was an article in BBC Focus Magazine, July 2008 (73,600\u000d\u000a      circulation). More reactive examples include a BBC Radio 5 live interview\u000d\u000a      on 12 November 2008, setting in context a report from the Royal Commission\u000d\u000a      on Environmental Pollution. When a paper was published on 20 May 2008\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the potential for some carbon nanotubes to have toxic\u000d\u000a      effects analogous to those of asbestos, Jones briefed the Research\u000d\u000a      Councils about the forthcoming paper, allowing them to prepare\u000d\u000a      well-considered positions to the news when it emerged, and provided\u000d\u000a      comments for the Science Media Centre, who summed up the resulting\u000d\u000a      extensive press interest thus: \"despite the potential for a huge scare\u000d\u000a        story the majority of coverage represented the research fairly.\" [S10]\u000d\u000a    Jones had a sustained involvement with the consumer group Which?\u000d\u000a      during a campaign about the use of nanotechnology in consumer products. He\u000d\u000a      supplied background information for, and was extensively quoted in an\u000d\u000a      article in the January 2008 Which? Magazine (circulation ca.\u000d\u000a      1.2 million), and was the scientific consultant for another article in\u000d\u000a      November 2008, focusing specifically on cosmetics. Which? ran a\u000d\u000a      Citizen's Jury on Nanotechnology, for which Jones acted on the steering\u000d\u000a      group and appeared in person as a witness; he was a panel member, together\u000d\u000a      with the Science Minister, at the public event that launched the results.[S4,\u000a        S5]\u000d\u000a    In the potentially very sensitive area of the use of nanotechnology in\u000d\u000a      food, Jones was the only academic invited to a round table at CIAA\u000d\u000a      (Confederation of the Food and Drink Industries of the EU) on 19 September\u000d\u000a      2008. This involved food manufacturers, leading NGOs, and the European\u000d\u000a      Commission. Jones spoke at a House of Lords Seminar on Nanotechnology on 4\u000d\u000a      November 2008, and gave both oral (30 June 2009) and written evidence to a\u000d\u000a      subsequent House of Lords Science and Technology Sub-Committee on\u000d\u000a      Nanotechnologies and Food. One area that Jones highlighted was the\u000d\u000a      importance of nanostructures and nanoparticles in food that are naturally\u000d\u000a      occurring or result from traditional food processing techniques (see final\u000d\u000a      report, paras 5.27-5.32), resulting in recommendation 14: \"We\u000d\u000a        recommend that, for regulatory purposes, any definition of\u000d\u000a        `nanomaterials' should exclude those created from natural food\u000d\u000a        substances, except for nanomaterials that have been deliberately chosen\u000d\u000a        or engineered to take advantage of their nanoscale properties.\" This\u000d\u000a      recommendation was accepted by government [S6].\u000d\u000a    Causality, of course, is very difficult to prove, but it is notable that\u000d\u000a      early fears of a GM-style campaign against nanotechnology in the UK have\u000d\u000a      not materialised, and major NGOs in the UK have not come out in blanket\u000d\u000a      opposition to the technology. For example, Greenpeace UK states \"Greenpeace\u000a        does not have a stance on nanotechnology as a whole, because the\u000d\u000a        applications will be too diverse... There may be some very beneficial\u000d\u000a        uses of nanotechnology....\" [S7]. In contrast, a series of\u000d\u000a      public debates on nanotechnology in France in 2010 had to be abandoned\u000d\u000a      because of disruptive protests and nanotechnology labs in Mexico have been\u000d\u000a      the subject of bombing attacks [S8].\u000d\u000a    3. Influence on science policy nationally and internationally\u000d\u000a    As nanotechnology senior strategic advisor, and with the strong support\u000d\u000a      of EPSRC's Societal Issues Panel, Jones was central to the commissioning,\u000d\u000a      implementation and use of a major multi-site public engagement\u000d\u000a      exercise as part of the framing of Nanomedicine Grand\u000d\u000a      Challenge &#8212; the Nanomedicine Dialogue. This was an important and\u000d\u000a      innovative experiment in the incorporation of public engagement in science\u000d\u000a      policy. The current EPSRC Nanotechnology Landscape Document [S9]\u000d\u000a      states:\u000d\u000a    \"The RS\/RAEng report highlighted the importance of public engagement in\u000d\u000a      this area, and this has led to a number of activities coordinated by Task\u000d\u000a      Force 5 of the NRCG. EPSRC has involved its researchers in 2 public\u000d\u000a      dialogues about nanotechnology, the latest of which fed public views and\u000d\u000a      aspirations into the development of the Nanotechnology Grand Challenge in\u000d\u000a      healthcare. This was groundbreaking in using the results of the public\u000d\u000a      dialogue to help inform the choice of research area. This area benefits\u000d\u000a      from having Professor Richard Jones as an ambassador for broader\u000d\u000a      engagement. The public acceptability of research and nano products can\u000d\u000a      often impact on their potential for commercialisation, further debate is\u000d\u000a      likely on the risks versus benefits for areas where nanotechnology is seen\u000d\u000a      to directly impact on human life e.g. food and drink, medicines, consumer\u000d\u000a      goods, household care products, or the discussion into the use of\u000d\u000a      nanosensors.\"\u000d\u000a    This exercise has had a direct impact on Research Council policy, as\u000d\u000a      demonstrated by a paper to EPSRC Council, 11 December 2008 (EPSRC57-08) on\u000d\u000a      public dialogues, which summarises the recommendation of EPSRC's Societal\u000d\u000a      Issues Panel on the Nanomedicine dialogue:\u000d\u000a    \"It concluded that the exercise had been a ground-breaking and\u000d\u000a      \"brave\" endeavour which had provided a very positive contribution to\u000d\u000a        the decision-making process. SIP commended this approach to the\u000d\u000a        Executive and Council.\" The paper goes on to say \"EPSRC executive\u000d\u000a        considered the advice from SIP and accepted the recommendations made.\u000d\u000a        The executive agree that, under the right circumstances, public\u000d\u000a        dialogues provide a useful generic tool in developing the strategy and\u000d\u000a        direction for specific research areas ... Indeed, following a discussion\u000d\u000a        at SIP in September, EPSRC and BBSRC have agreed to conduct a joint\u000d\u000a        public dialogue exercise around the area of synthetic biology.\"\u000d\u000a    In the field of science policy, the UK has been regarded as a leader in\u000d\u000a      the area of public engagement around nanotechnology, and Jones's important\u000d\u000a      role in this has been reflected by, for example, an invitation to give an\u000d\u000a      invited talk at Polish EU Presidency event \"Governance and ethics of\u000d\u000a        nanosciences and nanotechnologies Nanoethics 2011\", involving\u000d\u000a      National Academies of Science from across Europe and senior\u000d\u000a      representatives of the European Commission.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Nanotechnology emerged as a subject of public concern in the mid '00s,\u000d\u000a      raising the fear that it might become \"the next GM\" &#8212; a potentially\u000d\u000a      valuable technology becoming mired in controversy, based on widely\u000d\u000a      publicised misconceptions about its nature and likely future trajectory.\u000d\u000a      This has not happened in the UK; extensive public engagement activities,\u000d\u000a      in which Jones was centrally involved, had a significant impact on the\u000d\u000a      attitude of key NGOs and the wider public, raising the quality of debate\u000d\u000a      about this potentially controversial new technology.

Ryan, initiated a research programme in 2001, which exploited\u000d\u000a      self-assembly and Brownian motion to create functional nanoscale materials\u000d\u000a      and devices, including synthetic analogues to muscles and self-motile\u000d\u000a      particles [R1, R2, R3, R4]. This was motivated by the realisation\u000d\u000a      that the nanoscale devices of cell biology are based on design principles\u000d\u000a      that exploit the special physics of the nanoscale world, design principles\u000d\u000a      that are entirely unfamiliar in macroscopic engineering, but which could\u000d\u000a      be used in principle in entirely synthetic systems.\u000d\u000a    This philosophy was outlined in Jones's 2004 book Soft Machines:\u000d\u000a        Nanotechnology and Life (OUP), and the selected papers cited in\u000d\u000a      Section 3 are examples of the group's experimental realisations of some of\u000d\u000a      these ideas.

Through the employment of biopolymers such as DNA and proteins\u000d\u000a      they discussed their underpinning research on polymeric structures and how\u000d\u000a      this novel work leads to mimicking biological systems and building new\u000d\u000a      materials.\u000d\u000a    The presentation included many demonstrations and experiments describing\u000d\u000a      their published work. Students watched the formation of a physical biogel\u000d\u000a      with weakly cross-linked chains by adding borax to a solution of PVA (poly\u000d\u000a      vinyl alcohol dissolved in water), demonstrating the binding of &gt;90%\u000d\u000a      water using very little polymer typical of gels that we would find in the\u000d\u000a      body as lubricants\u000d\u000a    This work contained a deliberate emphasis on the link between the use of\u000d\u000a      proteins in the underpinning research and the human body as there are many\u000d\u000a      medical examples of the importance of understanding the aggregation of\u000d\u000a      proteins and peptides that would resonate with the students, for example,\u000d\u000a      cataracts and Alzheimer's disease.\u000d\u000a    In Dr Eiser's underpinning work the preparation of samples and the\u000d\u000a      ability to extract long chains of DNA was an important part of the\u000d\u000a      experimental procedure and students were able to watch, live, the\u000d\u000a      extraction of DNA from strawberries. From here students learned about the\u000d\u000a      significance of being able to create specifically designed biological\u000d\u000a      structures as described in the PNAS paper, citing natural world examples\u000d\u000a      of where these structures exists, for example, in butterfly wings and\u000d\u000a      opals, and the possible technological applications as biosensors and\u000d\u000a      electrical batteries.\u000d\u000a    The members of Cavendish Staff coordinating the Surface Physics Group\u000d\u000a      presentation were Dr Andrew Jardine and Dr William Allison. The specific\u000d\u000a      graphite system published in (iii) was chosen as both topical and\u000d\u000a      accessible to presentation through the ability to demonstrate the surface\u000d\u000a      structurelive. Live STM images enabled students to visualise and\u000d\u000a      appreciate the breadth of processes on the atomic scale that featured in\u000d\u000a      this research that they would otherwise find unimaginable.\u000d\u000a    The chosen surface was polycrystalline, highly oriented pyrolytic\u000d\u000a      graphite (HOPG) &#8212; one of the only materials that can be resolved at atomic\u000d\u000a      resolution in air and the surface on which the underpinning research was\u000d\u000a      conducted. The live STM demonstration included the preparation of the\u000d\u000a      scanning tip and sample, identical to that required for the sample\u000d\u000a      preparation in the published experiment.\u000d\u000a    Having enabled the students to observe live, a technique for viewing the\u000d\u000a      atomic surface of graphite, the presenters moved on to discuss the role of\u000d\u000a      surface structure and the motion of atoms and molecules on surfaces in a\u000d\u000a      variety of processes, such as chemical reactions. Particular emphasis was\u000d\u000a      given as to how the frictional regime between adsorbed atoms or molecules\u000d\u000a      and the graphite surface contribute to processes such as catalytic\u000d\u000a      reactivity, once again linking directly to the focus of the underpinning\u000d\u000a      research.\u000d\u000a    Teachers attending the 2012 exhibit quoted a variety of impacts on their\u000d\u000a      students that they had noted as a consequence of their visit to Physics at\u000d\u000a      Work.\u000d\u000a    \"Their [students'] interest in science and physics in particular has\u000d\u000a        increased,\" Lealands High School, Luton.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \"Pupils now see physics as a vocational choice as well as an academic\u000d\u000a        one,\" Oaks Park High School, Ilford.\u000d\u000a      \"Yes, more students study A-level physics\" Harlington Upper School,\u000d\u000a        Luton.\u000d\u000a        \"Even the students with no interest in Physics come away with a\u000d\u000a        positive image of the subject.\" Norwich High School for Girls.\u000d\u000a    The exhibition provided additional impact through staff and graduate\u000d\u000a      student development both within the department and industry.

Within this collaboration Prof. Donald\u000d\u000a      co-supervised the research in cell biology and rheology. The key findings\u000d\u000a      of this research were that hydrogelating self-assembling fibres (hSAFs)\u000d\u000a      gel at a concentration which is &gt;99% water and that changing the nature\u000d\u000a      of the inter-fibril interactions enables temperature responsive hydrogel\u000d\u000a      properties to be engineered. This published work supports the use of these\u000d\u000a      specific hydrogels as a new substrate for the growth of cells to enable\u000d\u000a      novel cell differentiation during growth and confirms that such substrates\u000d\u000a      would provide unprecedented control on design.\u000d\u000a    Also underpinning the BSS presentation is the work of Erika Eiser\u000d\u000a      (appointed Lecturer in 2007 and Reader in 2012) who published\u000d\u000a      collaborative work with researchers in the Ecole de Lausanne, Switzerland,\u000d\u000a      on colloidal gels and the previously unexplored class of materials &#8212;\u000d\u000a      bigels in November 2012ii. Erika Eiser was instrumental in all\u000d\u000a      aspects of the work pertaining to this publication, designing the\u000d\u000a      experiments undertaking the experimental research and co-authoring the\u000d\u000a      final paper. The key finding of the research was a new proposed mechanism\u000d\u000a      for creating bigels through the arrested demixing of 2 component mixtures\u000d\u000a      to form gel-like structures. One possible application of this outcome is\u000d\u000a      the mimicking of structural colour in natural materials such as the blue\u000d\u000a      butterfly wings or some blue bird feathers. Structural colours are due to\u000d\u000a      refraction of light from a high refactive index material with a specific\u000d\u000a      order; this order needs to be of the length scale of a couple of hundred\u000d\u000a      nanometers, which can be achieved with these colloidal bigels.\u000d\u000a    The Cavendish surface physics group developed a novel helium\u000d\u000a      scattering technique for studying the dynamics of atoms and molecules on\u000d\u000a      surfaces on nanometre length-scales and pico-second timescales. The\u000d\u000a      specific research underpinning the group's contribution to Physics at Work\u000d\u000a      was performed by staff members Holly Hedgeland (Research Associate 2006 to\u000d\u000a      2011), Andrew Jardine (Royal Society Research Fellow 2005 to present),\u000d\u000a      Gill Alexandrowicz (Research Fellow 2006 to 2008), William Allison (first\u000d\u000a      academic appointment 1983, promoted to Reader from 2002 to present) and\u000d\u000a      John Ellis (Assistant Director of Research 2000, promoted to Reader from\u000d\u000a      2010 to present). Collaboration with Peter Fouquet (previous Cavendish\u000d\u000a      member) at the ILL, Grenoble facilitated complimentary neutron scattering\u000d\u000a      measurements. The focus of the underpinning research, conducted from 2005\u000d\u000a      to 2009 and published in Nature Physicsiii, was to understand\u000d\u000a      the nature of the motion of a typical molecule, like benzene, on a\u000d\u000a      graphite surface. The key finding of this research was a novel frictional\u000d\u000a      regime in which single molecules of benzene move with Brownian motion over\u000d\u000a      a corrugated graphite surface. This regime was previously undiscovered and\u000d\u000a      a much lower friction hopping mechanism of motion would intuitively be\u000d\u000a      expected.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14576","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This first STFC research project described above was fundamental to\u000a      IMENSE being able to\u000a      finalise its image processing software, leading directly to its Series A\u000a      investment of &#163;0.5M in 2007\u000a      and subsequently thereafter to IMENSE producing its commercial products.\u000a      Following the second\u000a      STFC project, ending in 2009, the company was able to offer a variety of\u000a      products for sale, these\u000a      being based largely on the understanding of raw images gained in Parker's\u000a      STFC Innovations\u000a      Partnership Scheme (IPS) projects.

Based within the High Energy Physics\u000a      (HEP) Group,\u000a      Professor Parker has been involved in distributed computing since the late\u000a      1980's when he was\u000a      responsible for computing and data handling for the CERN flagship UA2\u000a      experiment, and produced\u000a      a series of groundbreaking physics results, for example [1]. He is a\u000a      member of GridPP, a\u000a      collaboration of particle physicists and computer scientists from the UK\u000a      and CERN which\u000a      developed the software to build a distributed computing Grid across the UK\u000a      for particle physicists.\u000a      Professor Parker was one of the authors of the original GridPP proposal in\u000a      2000 [2]. Funded by the\u000a      Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), GridPP was developed to\u000a      handle and analyse\u000a      the UK's share of the petabytes (one petabyte is one quadrillion bytes) of\u000a      data being generated by\u000a      the LHC annually, requiring huge data storage and processing capabilities.\u000a    Within the project, Professor Parker developed the Ganga distributed\u000a      computing management\u000a      system between 2002 and 2004 as a unique contribution from Cambridge\u000a      [3,4]. The scale of data\u000a      analysis task means that datasets are sent from the \"Tier 0\" centre at\u000a      CERN to 10 international\u000a      \"Tier 1\" centres, including one in the UK. Each national centre is linked\u000a      to \"Tier 2\" centres at\u000a      Universities which supply computing and storage resources. Data processing\u000a      tasks submitted to\u000a      the Grid need to be broken into a series of jobs, often numbering in the\u000a      thousands, which are\u000a      distributed to the centres housing the relevant data.

Ganga provides a framework for managing\u000a      thousands of such\u000a      processing applications in a coherent way, logging progress and dealing\u000a      with failures. Parker also\u000a      designed, developed and managed the Tier 2 Grid facilities in Cambridge,\u000a      which he further\u000a      developed to provide a campus-wide Grid computing facility (CamGrid) to\u000a      other researchers, using\u000a      custom software solutions developed by the HEP Group. The grid system in\u000a      Cambridge was\u000a      unique in connecting to both the outside grid and local resources. These\u000a      facilities and the software\u000a      systems developed by the HEP group are now part of the UK Grid, equivalent\u000a      to 40,000 PCs, and\u000a      were used for the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Since 2010\u000a      Professor Parker has exploited\u000a      the system to search for new physics outside of the current standard model\u000a      of particle physics\u000a      [5,6]. These studies included placing limits on the existence of new\u000a      particles, such as\u000a      supersymmetric partners to the standard model quarks and leptons, and on\u000a      constraining models\u000a      which predict extra space dimensions. The physics research outputs relied\u000a      on the success of\u000a      Parker's computing research and development.\u000a    The University set up the eScience Centre (now part of the Centre for\u000a      Scientific Computing) in\u000a      2002 in order to exploit this research in academia and industry. As\u000a      Director of eScience at the\u000a      Centre for Scientific Computing Centre from 2001 to 2007, Professor Parker\u000a      led the development\u000a      of grid computing initiatives across the University, including projects in\u000a      life sciences, earth\u000a      sciences, medicine, physics, chemistry and engineering, all requiring the\u000a      sharing of large\u000a      computational and data resources.\u000a    Software company IMENSE Ltd made contact with Prof. Parker in 2006\u000a      following an eScience\u000a      industry forum where grid research was presented, requesting his help to\u000a      address its needs in high\u000a      throughput computing. Prof. Parker won funding from the STFC research\u000a      council Innovations\u000a      Partnership Scheme for two research projects with IMENSE. The first\u000a      project (2006-2007) used an\u000a      adapted version of the Ganga system to process millions of images. The HEP\u000a      research group\u000a      modified Ganga to manage a search for images across the internet, and to\u000a      process them using the\u000a      IMENSE algorithms. The Cambridge Tier 2 site and collaborating sites were\u000a      used as the platform.\u000a      During the second project (2007-2009) Professor Parker's research centred\u000a      on escalating his\u000a      previous work to provide the level of technology required for industrial\u000a      use.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14579","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The initial Cambridge research into building MEMS devices on the\u000a      nano-scale showed that shrinking MEMS devices allows them to work faster,\u000a      at lower voltages and more reliably. The speed of operation enabled these\u000a      devices to be used for making small fast operating variable capacitors for\u000a      mobile phone applications. The low resistance of the moving metal parts\u000a      ensures operation with a high electrical quality factor. The advantage of\u000a      using MEMS for memory products is that the low voltage operation removes\u000a      the requirement for charge pumps in embedded memory applications.\u000a    As mentioned in section 2, the research underpinning the development of\u000a      MEMS devices was considered enough to attract a considerable amount of VC\u000a      funding. In 2000 the results were such that the company was able to raise\u000a      $6,000,000 to hire a CEO and to set up a research lab external to the\u000a      University, allowing the company to start developing its first silicon\u000a      foundry compatible nano- scale MEMS device, a non-volatile memory product.\u000a      This development work was performed outside the department. Pushing for\u000a      the smallest possible MEMS devices allowed other products to be developed\u000a      with enhanced performance properties such at the digital variable\u000a      capacitor that is currently the main product of the company. Joint\u000a      research grants between Cavendish Kinetics and the University of Cambridge\u000a      Physics Department continued until 2005[i2]. Thereafter, in 2006\u000a      $15,500,000 more in VC funding allowed Cavendish Kinetics to set up a\u000a      subsidiary in San Jose in California with the CMOS research team shifting\u000a      from Germany to the US, allowing the company to grow to over 30 employees.\u000a      Within the relevant period, a further $10 million in investments from\u000a      Qualcomm and other VC's came into the company (2011) [i4] which allowed\u000a      the company to fully develop the digital variable capacitor products for\u000a      mobile phone applications.\u000a    The latest 4G or LTE technology used in smart phones allows much faster\u000a      data transmission because data can be split between more than one band,\u000a      both during upload and download. In the UK there are three bands used for\u000a      LTE, the value of the frequency used is different for different regions of\u000a      the globe. There is no room in the phone to house more than one antenna,\u000a      so to solve this problem phones use resonant filters connected to the\u000a      antenna to tune them to work at different frequencies. At present this is\u000a      achieved with a gallium arsenide switch connected to a fixed capacitor.\u000a      This combination is expensive, because the switches need to operate up to\u000a      several gigahertz without distorting the signal or damping the resonance.\u000a      Ultimately it is predicted that smart phones will need to operate over 20\u000a      bands worldwide [i7]. The Cavendish Kinetics solution replaces all these\u000a      components with a digital variable capacitor which is fabricated at a\u000a      standard CMOS foundry. Cavendish Kinetics ported its unique MEMS process\u000a      for nano-scale MEMS devices to a partner foundry TowerJazz Ltd that is\u000a      manufacturing chips that will be sold to phone manufacturers. The first\u000a      chip was launched in June 2013.\u000a    There is another advantage to the Cavendish Kinetics technology and this\u000a      relates to the variation in the antenna performance depending on its\u000a      position relative to your body. If a phone is sitting on the desk or in\u000a      your pocket being used with headphones, the stray capacitance is different\u000a      from when it is held in your hand next to your head. This causes a shift\u000a      in the performance of the antenna which can be corrected for directly\u000a      using Cavendish Kinetics technology in a way that is not possible with the\u000a      current technology. Thus this product will allow new phone designs to take\u000a      full advantage of new high speed mobile phone networks referred to as LTE\u000a      or 4G which are now available in the US, Europe and Japan. It also results\u000a      in a longer time between battery charges as less power is required. Being\u000a      able to send and receive mobile signals more efficiently means that the\u000a      mobile phone signal suppliers do not need to build extra phone mast to\u000a      ensure fast data rates are available for everyone. As the chip replaces\u000a      several other components, it can also lead to a reduction in the cost of\u000a      the parts for the mobile phone.\u000a    Thus the research at Cavendish has led to a new product that became\u000a      available in 2013 [i3] which reduces the energy consumption and improve\u000a      the performance of mobile phones.\u000a\u0009 On a smaller scale, since 2008 the\u000a      development has provided over 140 person years of employment to engineers\u000a      and scientists in the US, and Europe and has resulted in over 97 published\u000a      patents [i10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Cambridge research led to the creation of spin-out company,\u000a      Cavendish Kinetics which developed a micro electro mechanical (MEMS)\u000a      process technology that allows MEMS devices to be fabricated in a standard\u000a      silicon foundry.

Starting prior to the period, in\u000a      1991, Smith (now Professor) began investigations into quantum phenomena in\u000a      the electrical mechanical properties of nanometre scale devices. Smith\u000a      began investigations into the thermal properties of nanometre scale\u000a      devices [r1]. Part of the research involved fabricating free-standing\u000a      metal structures less than 0,1 micron wide and thick and a few microns\u000a      long. This was some of the first research into the nanomechanical\u000a      properties at this length scale and directly led to the initial invention\u000a      by Professor Smith of using micro- mechanical devices (MEMS) for\u000a      non-volatile memory applications [r2]. This patent was submitted in 1993\u000a      and has been cited over 100 times in other patent applications.\u000a    Cavendish Kinetics Ltd [i1] was formed in October 1994 by Smith then an\u000a      Advanced EPSRC Fellow working on quantum transport phenomena. VC funding\u000a      was used by the company to continue research at the University Department\u000a      of Physics into the area of the nano-mechanical properties of sub-micron\u000a      MEMS devices. This research continued until 2002. The initial\u000a      investigations were focussed on studying the lifetime issues related to\u000a      fabricating MEMS devices on this length scale. Techniques for reliably\u000a      fabricating devices on this length scale, using materials that would be\u000a      allowed in a silicon foundry, were also performed during this period\u000a      resulting in the following publications [r1, r3, r4]. That research showed\u000a      that MEMS devices could be fabricated on this very small length scale, and\u000a      that they could be switched millions of times reliably. It also showed\u000a      that problems with adhesion at the contacts could be overcome and that the\u000a      contact resistance was at a low enough level for real device applications.\u000a      That research was basic underpinning research and not development work.\u000a      The company paid for this research with grants to the Department of over\u000a      &#163;750,000.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14594","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Duffett-Smith founded spin-out Company Cambridge Positioning Systems\u000a      (CPS) in 1995 in order\u000a      to commercially exploit his tracking technology, developed in the\u000a      Cavendish Laboratory, where he\u000a      remains still as an academic member of staff.

Between 1980 and 1990 Duffett-Smith and his\u000a      research group\u000a      developed a prototype location technology `CURSOR' which used the\u000a      broadcasts by AM local\u000a      radio stations to track moving vehicles. Post 1993, these techniques were\u000a      developed further by\u000a      the group and applied to mobile phones [1]. These systems needed to use\u000a      signals received\u000a      simultaneously by the mobile receiver, whose position was to be\u000a      determined, and a second\u000a      receiver (location measurement unit: LMU) whose position was known. A\u000a      crucial development by\u000a      Duffett-Smith, code-named `Matrix' [2] and `Virtual LMU' [3], did away\u000a      with the need for the LMU,\u000a      opening the way for moving mobile phones to track themselves\u000a      independently. The Virtual LMU\u000a      ideas were incorporated also into computer servers which assisted the\u000a      mobile phones to find their\u000a      positions. These ideas underpinned the research group's subsequent\u000a      development of techniques\u000a      which allowed the transfer of accurate time information within a mobile\u000a      terminal from one place and\u000a      time to a later place and time [4]. Manufacturers of mobile phones had\u000a      discovered that the Global\u000a      Positioning System (GPS), which used the signals from orbiting satellites,\u000a      did not work very well\u000a      indoors where the satellite signals were weak. Duffett-Smith's accurate\u000a      time-transfer technology\u000a      was then applied to provide accurate time and position information,\u000a      code-named Enhanced GPS\u000a      (eGPS), to assist the GPS receivers in the recovery of the weak signals\u000a      [4, 5]. Duffett-Smith's other\u000a      research developments during this period included various enhancements to\u000a      the ways in which a\u000a      mobile's position could be calculated, and the application of CPS\u000a      technology to CDMA systems [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16273","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Energy supply remains a key technological challenge and the development\u000a      of alternative sources is central to future energy security. In the short\u000a      and medium term, however, hydrocarbons are set to remain fundamental to\u000a      energy provision. Shell UK employs around 7,000 people and produces almost\u000a      13% of oil and gas in the country. Exploration is required to identify new\u000a      reservoirs and maintain hydrocarbon supplies, but major hydrocarbon\u000a      discoveries are becoming increasingly rare and situated in remote,\u000a      inaccessible places. This is reflected by the increase in exploration\u000a      costs, which have risen for Shell and its subsidiaries from $3.9 billion\u000a      per annum in 2009 to $5.7 billion per annum in 2011.\u000a    The greatest financial risks sustained by oil companies are associated\u000a      with `frontier' exploration, where crucial licensing and development\u000a      decisions are made on the basis of limited and often unreliable survey\u000a      data. For this reason, cost effective survey methods that can rapidly\u000a      screen large geographical areas for promising sedimentary conditions\u000a      (indicating the likelihood of oil reservoirs) are particularly important.\u000a      Traditionally, such tools scan the ground for gravitational and magnetic\u000a      anomalies commonly associated with oil fields. These methods, costing\u000a      hundreds of thousands of dollars per square kilometre, only represent the\u000a      first step &#8212; when potentially promising regions are identified, techniques\u000a      such as 3D seismic surveys are deployed to refine the understanding of\u000a      geological conditions. These further explorations can cost an additional\u000a      $25,000 per square kilometre for acquisition and interpretation of\u000a      underground data.\u000a    The LightTouch&#8482; technology, developed in collaboration between\u000a      Shell and Padgett's team at the University of Glasgow, has made and\u000a      continues to make significant contributions to the company's survey\u000a      campaigns and exploration decision-making across the world. Since\u000a      transition to airborne deployment, LightTouch&#8482; has evolved from\u000a      the initial design conceived by the University of Glasgow and now detects\u000a      methane concentrations in the atmosphere. Fourteen years from the start of\u000a      the collaboration with Shell and despite evolution in the hardware set-up,\u000a      the University of Glasgow algorithms still remain at the heart of the\u000a      company's data analysis. These algorithms continue to provide a\u000a      well-proven system against which to benchmark any new developments in data\u000a      collection or numerical methods.\u000a    It is estimated that the costs associated with a LightTouch&#8482;\u000a      survey are around 10% of those associated with seismic methods over the\u000a      same area. Moreover, the data from seepage maps can be accessed\u000a      immediately to help guide the deployment of other, more expensive\u000a      exploration resources. Onshore wells can each cost up to tens of millions\u000a      of pounds depending on the difficulties presented by terrain and geology;\u000a      in frontier exploration, three quarters of these wells on average, fail to\u000a      deliver any return on investment. LightTouch&#8482; can be deployed\u000a      in parallel to more traditional large-scale survey technologies with\u000a      minimal added costs. Its hydrocarbon seepage maps help guide, complement\u000a      and refine survey data from other techniques and substantially increase\u000a      confidence in their accuracy.

The fourteen year collaboration with Shell\u000a      (1999-2013) has been centred on the development and validation of\u000a      LightTouch&#8482;, a novel, ultra-sensitive oil and gas prospecting\u000a      technique. The sensor, a portable absorption spectroscopy system, is able\u000a      to detect sub part per billion (ppb) concentration of ethane gas from a\u000a      range of several kilometres, allowing large areas to be surveyed quickly\u000a      and efficiently.\u000a    Compared with other gases, ethane is an ideal indicator of hydrocarbon\u000a      reservoirs. The background concentration of ethane in the atmosphere is\u000a      only around one ppb, making detection of seepage possible, provided a high\u000a      sensitivity detector is employed. LightTouch&#8482; relies on the\u000a      ultra-high sensitivity performance of the detector to measure ethane\u000a      concentration at a fixed point in space, while the corresponding wind\u000a      distribution is simultaneously recorded. Sophisticated algorithms, also\u000a      developed by the University of Glasgow's Optics Group, are at the core of\u000a      the system and allow for the distribution of ethane concentration over a\u000a      large area upwind from the detector to be precisely inferred from the\u000a      point-concentration and wind-field data.\u000a    In its early form (2001), the portable gas detection system utilised\u000a      laser diodes shone through a cell in which air was continuously sampled.\u000a      The system measured trace ethane down to around 0.1 ppb with a 1-second\u000a      response time and accuracy better than 0.1 ppb, sufficient to detect\u000a      significant emissions from a range of several kilometres and making it, at\u000a      the time, the world's most sensitive ethane detector.\u000a    The operation of the spectrometer was fully automated for ease of use in\u000a      the field. Data from the anemometer was automatically logged with the\u000a      corresponding ethane concentration and fed to the algorithms to\u000a      reconstruct the ethane distribution map. The ethane concentration was\u000a      derived by dividing the area to be surveyed into a grid of point sources\u000a      of gas seepage of unknown strength. The ethane concentration at any point\u000a      in the grid could then be derived from an algorithm correlating the\u000a      measured gas concentration at the sampling location, the wind strength and\u000a      direction with the offset of each point in the grid with respect to the\u000a      sampling point. Because the same concentration of ethane can be originated\u000a      by a weak source located in the proximity of the sampling point or by a\u000a      strong source located at a distance from the sampling point, multiple\u000a      measurements at different locations or under different wind strengths were\u000a      taken to reduce ambiguity.\u000a    In its first field implementation trialled in 2002 the prototype\u000a      spectrometer, complete with wind sensors and computer control, was mounted\u000a      on an off-road vehicle for deployment in field trials.\u000a    The technique was validated by taking measurements of a known\u000a      distribution in a desert environment and also by direct comparison with\u000a      the results obtained from established techniques during the survey of oil\u000a      fields. LightTouch&#8482; was also deployed by Shell from an aircraft\u000a      in two key on-shore oil prospecting missions over areas of 10,000km2.\u000a      During its deployment in Algeria and Tunisia between 2001 and 2002,\u000a      seepage maps obtained from LightTouch&#8482; were employed\u000a      simultaneously with gravity sensors and magnetic survey data.\u000a    The reliability of the sensor and data analysis systems developed in\u000a      collaboration with the University of Glasgow has been demonstrated in\u000a      field deployment in Dubai, Oman, Canada and the UK. The data collected\u000a      gave Shell confidence that seepage maps obtained from spectroscopic\u000a      techniques could substantially help to refine subsurface models obtained\u000a      from other survey data sets and play a major role in revealing the\u000a      structure and conditions necessary to generate and trap hydrocarbons.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16647","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Across industry, numerical simulation has become an increasingly\u000d\u000a      important tool for understanding fast mechanical processes, due to both\u000d\u000a      the high cost of performing full-scale experiments and the additional\u000d\u000a      insights obtained through using these tools.

For many projects it is\u000d\u000a      therefore difficult to provide detailed metrics relating to the impact, as\u000d\u000a      it relates to confidential, commercially sensitive, or classified\u000d\u000a      projects. However, one application in the public domain which demonstrates\u000d\u000a      the impact of Cambridge material characterisation work is the development\u000d\u000a      of a novel reactive metal perforator for the oil and gas industries.\u000d\u000a    The principle of the device is to use an explosively formed metal jet to\u000d\u000a      perforate material around an oil\/gas borehole, releasing oil &amp; gas\u000d\u000a      from the surrounding strata. Previously, QinetiQ plc developed perforator\u000d\u000a      like devices using materials models validated against SMF Fracture &amp;\u000d\u000a      Shock Physics group data. The enabling research included basic\u000d\u000a      understanding of the compaction and shock response of metallic systems,\u000d\u000a      such as that described in [1]. For example, copper is widely used in\u000d\u000a      explosively formed perforators, and the validation data described in [2]\u000d\u000a      was made available to QinetiQ well before the publication date. The\u000d\u000a      particular impact described here involved replacement of a standard\u000d\u000a      metallic component with a reactive component formed from at least two\u000d\u000a      species of compacted metal powders. Achieving this required a detailed\u000d\u000a      understanding of the compaction and shock response of powdered materials\u000d\u000a      [3,4].\u000d\u000a    The critical element of this new device was a reactive metal `liner',\u000d\u000a      formed from a mixture of compressed powdered nickel and aluminium. This\u000d\u000a      enabled QinetiQ to develop novel equation of state (EOS) models for the\u000d\u000a      composite material, making use of the underpinning high-rate material\u000d\u000a      characterisation data provided by the SMF Fracture &amp; Shock Physics\u000d\u000a      group research. In addition to fundamental understanding [1-4], the SMF\u000d\u000a      Fracture &amp; Shock Physics group provided further specific data on the\u000d\u000a      response of nickel-aluminium compacts. The data was in the form of a\u000d\u000a      confidential technical report and data provided prior to the report, some\u000d\u000a      of which has been reported in [5].\u000d\u000a    Using these models, it was possible to develop and test a novel reactive\u000d\u000a      metal perforator rapidly, using a nickel-aluminium-titanium mixture. The\u000d\u000a      device has been commercially produced since 2007 and has sold over one\u000d\u000a      million units since then [6]. The oil and gas industries are substantial\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries of the technology; the product enables more effective\u000d\u000a      perforation of the rock strata around boreholes, substantially improving\u000d\u000a      oil and gas recovery, particularly in more difficult oil fields, and thus\u000d\u000a      extending their economic viability. The development of the project by\u000d\u000a      QinetiQ plc, using underlying data provided by Cambridge, won the QinetiQ\u000d\u000a      \/ DSTL John Benjamin Memorial Prize, 2012 [8]. Over a million devices have\u000d\u000a      now been manufactured since 2007. Companies such as Shell (who were\u000d\u000a      involved in commercialisation of the product, since the very first stages)\u000d\u000a      have reported substantial increases in perforation charge performance\u000d\u000a      using the new devices, which is measured through oil recovery (up to\u000d\u000a      30-40% increase) as summarised in article [9].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken in the University of Cambridge Department of Physics\u000d\u000a      has provided benchmark data on, and fundamental physical insights into,\u000d\u000a      the high strain-rate response of materials, including powdered reactive\u000d\u000a      metal compositions.

Experimental techniques have been developed to study a wide range\u000d\u000a      of materials including metallic systems, ceramics and polymers, as well as\u000d\u000a      granular and energetic\/reactive materials. A unique and important focus of\u000d\u000a      the group's research has been development of novel instrumentation, and\u000d\u000a      simultaneous deployment of multiple diagnostics to maximise the\u000d\u000a      information available from experiments. In relation to the impact\u000d\u000a      described below, response of metals to high amplitude shock wave loading\u000d\u000a      has been a particularly important area of research. For example, research\u000d\u000a      in [1] provided an extended body of experimental data characterising the\u000d\u000a      behaviour of tungsten. The investigation showed that the shear strength\u000d\u000a      increases significantly with increasing stress, and this resolved a\u000d\u000a      published disagreement in the literature. The data provided underlying\u000d\u000a      physical understanding and measurements of parameters essential for\u000d\u000a      developing numerical models of tungsten and tungsten alloy systems.\u000d\u000a    Development of accurate material models requires initial measurement of\u000d\u000a      physical parameters, as described above, followed by validation\u000d\u000a      experiments in more complex geometries, to confirm that the models conform\u000d\u000a      to the experimentally observed behaviour. One such validation experiment\u000d\u000a      is symmetric Taylor impact which, probes a range of different strain rates\u000d\u000a      as well as both elastic and plastic responses in a single experiment. The\u000d\u000a      research in [2] undertaken by the group in 1998-2000 described a series\u000d\u000a      of such validation experiments for copper, a material widely used in high\u000d\u000a      strain rate experiments and devices. The research included further\u000d\u000a      development of the experimental technique, and provided new insights\u000d\u000a      gained in the material response.\u000d\u000a    In addition to metals, the group has studied compaction of numerous\u000d\u000a      granular \/ powdered materials, and the relationships between granular and\u000d\u000a      consolidated materials. The research in [3] demonstrated the limitations\u000d\u000a      of compaction models, and the need for comprehensive experimental\u000d\u000a      characterisation. Research in [4] characterised the shock response of\u000d\u000a      powdered aluminium compacts, and examined the applicability of various\u000d\u000a      equations of state. This research represented the first measurement of\u000d\u000a      spall strength of a porous ductile material, showing that the dynamic\u000d\u000a      tensile strength of shock compacted porous aluminium is relatively small,\u000d\u000a      and likely dependent on both the initial pore structure and strain rate.\u000d\u000a      These are key concepts required in development of numerical material\u000d\u000a      models for compressed powder compacts.\u000d\u000a    Leading on from the research strands described above and starting in\u000d\u000a      2009, the mechanical and reactive properties of pressed nickel-aluminium\u000d\u000a      compacts have been studied over a variety of strain rates, including a\u000d\u000a      study of the intermetallic reaction initiation and kinetics under shock\u000d\u000a      loading.

These devices were\u000d\u000a      purported to detect small electrical and magnetic signals at great\u000d\u000a      distances, in a similar manner to the techniques pioneered in the Quantum\u000d\u000a      Matter group. Dr Sutherland devised and conducted a series of double blind\u000d\u000a      tests on the separate substance detection devices to test their efficacy\u000d\u000a      under scientific conditions, and also produced detailed critiques on the\u000d\u000a      science that the devices claimed to use. He was also called to The Old\u000d\u000a      Bailey on four separate occasions as an expert witness [8].\u000d\u000a    Fraudulent bomb detection devices were sold to police forces and the\u000d\u000a      military in many countries, most noticeably in Iraq, where they\u000d\u000a      contributed to significant loss of life through their inability to prevent\u000d\u000a      suicide bombings. A UK government ban on exporting such devices was put in\u000d\u000a      place in 2010 while the investigations were undertaken.\u000d\u000a    In considering the operating mechanism of these fraudulent explosives\u000d\u000a      detectors, Dr. Sutherland drew heavily on his knowledge of the techniques\u000d\u000a      employed in the above body of research to rigorously assess the physics of\u000d\u000a      the devices. The ADE-651 device for instance was alleged to work on the\u000d\u000a      principle of Nuclear Quadropole Resonance (NQR), which would require\u000d\u000a      detection of small electrical signals in coils similar to those used in\u000d\u000a      [2,6]. A calculation of the size of NQR signals that might be sensed by\u000d\u000a      this device proved unequivocally that the NQR effect would yield signals\u000d\u000a      far below the threshold detection limit. Similarly, the GT200 device was\u000d\u000a      said to be sensitive to diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses of\u000d\u000a      substances some 700m away from the operator. Using experience gained in\u000d\u000a      designing detection coils for use in magnetic susceptibility measurements,\u000d\u000a      it was possibly to demonstrate that the claims of the manufacturer of this\u000d\u000a      device were similarly impossible.\u000d\u000a    The thorough scientific assessment of the operating principles of these\u000d\u000a      devices, along with rigorous double blind testing of their effectiveness\u000d\u000a      by Dr. Sutherland formed a key part of the prosecution case. Leading\u000d\u000a      Counsel of the prosecution states, \"Although his contribution to all of\u000d\u000a      the trials has been invaluable, Dr Sutherland's considerable expertise in\u000d\u000a      superconductors and novel magnetic and metallic materials, was essential\u000d\u000a      in the trials relating to the ADE 651 and the GT200....The independence of\u000d\u000a      Dr Sutherland's research, the quality of it, the clarity of his reports\u000d\u000a      and the evidence he gave were all fundamental in securing convictions.\"[7]\u000d\u000a    The impact of this work is twofold. First, in 2013 convictions were\u000d\u000a      secured in 3 of the 4 trials, with the fourth trial ongoing. This has\u000d\u000a      disrupted several major international fraud rings, with an estimated\u000d\u000a      combined turnover of &#163;70 million. The use of the fraudulent bomb detection\u000d\u000a      devices had caused significant human damage. On delivering a guilty\u000d\u000a      verdict, Judge Richard Hone QC said that use of the devices \"in all\u000d\u000a      probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to innocent\u000d\u000a      individuals\" [9]. A former British Army bomb disposal officer stated\u000d\u000a      \"Countless tragedies have been caused, both directly and indirectly,\u000d\u000a      because of these devices.\"[10]. The Detective Superintendent who led the\u000d\u000a      Avon and Somerset police investigation said \"I'm confident people have\u000d\u000a      lost their lives because of this.\" [11]. The City of London Police confirm\u000d\u000a      that \"Dr Sutherland's contribution to the investigation was a key factor\u000d\u000a      in securing guilty convictions for fraud at court, and for stopping the\u000d\u000a      manufacture and sale of these devices\" [8].\u000d\u000a    A second impact has been the enhancement of the international reputation\u000d\u000a      of UK science through significant national and international press\u000d\u000a      coverage, much of which has reported on the work of Dr. Sutherland.

This technique requires\u000d\u000a      extremely sensitive measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetization\u000d\u000a      and magnetic susceptibility. Custom designed electronic circuits and\u000d\u000a      cryostats for this purpose were pioneered by Profs.

The use of\u000d\u000a      bespoke low temperature superconducting transformers and vibration\u000d\u000a      isolation allowed the electrical noise levels on the group's dilution\u000d\u000a      fridge system to reach levels as low as 1 pV\/sqrt Hz, in the presence of\u000d\u000a      large magnetic fields and at low temperatures.\u000d\u000a    Research in the group from 2005 focused on creating miniature-sized\u000d\u000a      detection coils for use in high-pressure measurements of magnetic\u000d\u000a      susceptibility [2,6], and on custom designing piezoresistive cantilevers\u000d\u000a      to measure magnetization. These techniques have been employed in a number\u000d\u000a      of recent studies of correlated electron materials in high impact journals\u000d\u000a      [1-6].\u000d\u000a    Through this work, the group has built up significant expertise in\u000d\u000a      detection of small signals, and accrued a scientific reputation for\u000d\u000a      excellence in experimental physics.

These\u000a      awards were\u000a      designed to train research-council funded fellows in how to start a\u000a      business. Significant commercial\u000a      interest then led to the creation of spin-out Geomerics in 2005.

The main\u000a      focus of this research in Physics was towards theoretical physics,\u000a      cosmology and astrophysics, but\u000a      the new geometrical methods involved were of wider applicability. The\u000a      groundwork for this\u000a      broadening of application was laid in a 5 year EPSRC Advanced Fellowship\u000a      awarded to Dr Chris\u000a      Doran in 1999, held in the Astrophysics Group. The Fellowship was awarded\u000a      to investigate ways\u000a      that GA could be exploited in the fields of computer graphics and computer\u000a      vision. This research\u000a      was conducted in collaboration with Anthony Lasenby (Assistant Director of\u000a      Research from 1987,\u000a      Reader from 1996, Professor from 2000 to present, Department of Physics)\u000a      and Joan Lasenby\u000a      (Royal Society Research Fellow from 1994, Lecturer from 2003, Senior\u000a      Lecturer from 2010,\u000a      Department of Engineering). The outcomes of this research were a series of\u000a      results demonstrating\u000a      how algorithms based on GA could solve problems in graphics and vision\u000a      faster and more robustly\u000a      than traditional techniques. During this period the research was broadened\u000a      to include applications\u000a      to rigid body dynamics.\u000a    The initial IP that went into Geomerics formation was generated primarily\u000a      at Cambridge University,\u000a      with a secondary contribution from a researcher based in Arizona State.\u000a      The contributors at\u000a      Arizona State University were Prof David Hestenes and Prof Alyn Rockwood,\u000a      who granted\u000a      Geomerics a non-exclusive license to exploit a patent around the use of\u000a      conformal geometric\u000a      algebra in robotics. This patented technology did not form part of the\u000a      final Enlighten product from\u000a      Geomerics.\u000a    The research that led to the breakthrough product, `Enlighten', in 2007\u000a      was carried out jointly by\u000a      Geomerics internal team and staff at Cambridge University, in particular\u000a      Mike Hobson (Reader at\u000a      that time, promoted to a Professorship in 2011) and Anthony Lasenby from\u000a      the Department of\u000a      Physics. Enlighten computes the bounced light in a world in real time,\u000a      which has always been\u000a      viewed as an extremely hard problem. Enlighten is not the result of a\u000a      single clever algorithm; it has\u000a      required years of research and engineering across disciplines in signal\u000a      processing, compression,\u000a      de-noising, surface mapping, spherical harmonic lighting, etc. to produce\u000a      a polished product. At\u000a      various points Cavendish staff have contributed to this effort. Mike\u000a      Hobson led the effort in de-\u000a      noising research, applying ideas developed in his own research to the\u000a      problem faced in Enlighten.\u000a      He worked on the use of wavelets to compress images and speed up\u000a      calculations. Anthony\u000a      Lasenby contributed to the problem of surface mapping (unwrapping a curved\u000a      surface to a 2D\u000a      planar map.) He used ideas from his research on conformal geometric\u000a      algebra to help develop new\u000a      algorithms for unwrapping geometry that minimised distortion.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16710","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Within the UK Physics community Donald has a unique breadth of expertise\u000a      in biological physics, which made her a natural choice to be the inaugural\u000a      chair of the IOP's Biological Physics Group.

This is part of their desire to see\u000a      biological physics fully recognized within the undergraduate provision of\u000a      Physics Departments as part of teaching best practice.\u000a    The aim of the project is to produce material to facilitate the\u000a      introduction of the topic of Biological Physics into the undergraduate\u000a      curriculum, particularly for those departments which lack specific\u000a      expertise in the field on their staff. Starting in 2009, when the IOP\u000a      first approached Donald to put together a team of writers to create a body\u000a      of work, Donald and Cicuta have been involved in the production of\u000a      material. All the material now on the website has been checked and\u000a      overseen by Donald. There is now a significant body of new material which\u000a      has been uploaded onto the IOP's dedicated site. All of the material\u000a      currently available is free to anyone who registers, from anywhere in the\u000a      world (1). To date, the site has been visited more than 25,000 times, with\u000a      more than 8000 unique visitors and an average of 1100 page visits per\u000a      month.\u000a    The logic for producing this material was based on the comments in the\u000a      Wakeham Review which stated:\u000a    - `it is essential that students continue to be exposed to areas of\u000a        the subject which are particularly applicable in the 21st\u000a      century such as biophysics\/medicine....\u000a    - physics students in many departments get regrettably little\u000a        exposure, if any, to modern soft matter physics and biophysics.'\u000a    The IOP took the lead in trying to change this situation by committing\u000a      &#163;70k to this project, having established &#8212; through a questionnaire sent to\u000a      all heads of physics departments in the UK &#8212; that there was an unmet need\u000a      that academics felt could be addressed by the preparation of suitable\u000a      material. Responses to the question as to whether departments thought such\u000a      material would be useful included (15 Physics Departments responded) 1) `We\u000a        would welcome suggestions for how biological physics could be used to\u000a        enrich the physics syllabus. There are many biological examples that\u000a        could be used to teach core physics while introducing the idea that\u000a        physicists can contribute to the life sciences.' 2) `Any\u000a        assistance in the development of material would be appreciated.' 3)\u000a      `Yes, we could well be interested &#8212; we would certainly be more\u000a        interested in teaching such a course if the IOP could make course\u000a        materials available to us, as we do not have substantial staff expertise\u000a        in this area'. These responses indicated a clear enthusiasm for the\u000a      project to go ahead. Donald was involved in the project from the outset,\u000a      assisted by a project management team who collectively made decisions on\u000a      the topics to be covered and the authors to be invited to write each\u000a      contribution.\u000a    Plans were sufficiently far advanced that in May 2011 a launch meeting\u000a      was held, although at that time few lectures were actually available\u000a      online (the IOP and IOPP &#8212; the Publishing arm of the IOP- have taken\u000a      charge of all preparation of material to make web-ready). The launch was\u000a      attended by around 40 people (including heads of departments) from\u000a      different departments within the UK. Donald described both the project and\u000a      the launch on her blog and has subsequently promoted the projects through\u000a      articles in the Guardian and on the IOP's own website.\u000a    The online lectures- written by about half a dozen carefully chosen\u000a      individuals from within the UK &#8212; have been viewed over 13,700 times. With\u000a      her expertise in polysaccharides, Donald contributed the lecture on\u000a      polysaccharides which has received 2399 individual page visits, as well as\u000a      the introduction and overview; Cicuta wrote 6 lectures on thermodynamics\u000a      and lipids which have in total received 4877 individual page visits. The\u000a      lectures, comprising PowerPoint presentations, text, references and model\u000a      questions with solutions, are designed to be used in a variety of ways as\u000a      part of the philosophy of making the material as useful as possible to\u000a      departments: some simply want examples that can be added in to existing\u000a      lecture courses to make it easier to incorporate some basic material into\u000a      their curriculum, others want to introduce whole modules. Which route each\u000a      department takes depends on their course structure and the expertise they\u000a      have on their teaching staff. The aim is to make sure that all UK\u000a      departments introduce some material into their teaching, although\u000a      currently the IOP have ruled out making any of the material a formal\u000a      requirement of departmental accreditation, because that would take a long\u000a      time to put into practice.\u000a    Within 6 months of launch there were an average number of over 1000 hits\u000a      per month, with North America having the largest traffic, followed by\u000a      Northern Europe (including the UK) and Southern Asia. Thus, although the\u000a      project was designed with UK academia in mind, it is clearly reaching far\u000a      beyond this initial target audience.\u000a    Already it is clear that more departments are introducing this topic into\u000a      their courses, either simply prompted by the very clear message the IOP is\u000a      giving out, or actually using the material being produced. For instance,\u000a      in both Durham and Bristol new courses in biophysics\/biological physics\u000a      are being constructed which are accessing the concepts and material on the\u000a      website. In Manchester, where there is a course in the 1st year\u000a      but it precedes student exposure to thermodynamics, the course lecturer\u000a      said `During the last semester I directed the students in our first\u000a        year course on biological physics to look at the IOP web site during the\u000a        first lecture. Most of the lecture material is probably too hard for our\u000a        first year (they do not cover the 2nd law of thermodynamics until second\u000a        year), but they will profit from some of the videos and it is good to\u000a        establish in their minds that biological physics is 'real physics' at an\u000a        early stage.' The comment from Bristol was 'First of all, what\u000a        an incredible resource! I feel like I've only just skimmed the surface\u000a        of it, as every time I look at the notes, I find something else that is\u000a        useful!....As this is my first time developing a lecture course from\u000a        scratch, I was pretty overwhelmed. What the biological physics pages\u000a        have done is given me confidence that a) I'm teaching the right things\u000a        (as most of the syllabus I came up with on my own is covered by these\u000a        lectures) and b) I have the foundations of a series of lectures that I\u000a        can personalise with examples of my own... thank you (and to all\u000a        involved) for doing these! It's taken a huge amount of stress away from\u000a        me and has actually turned a job I was dreading into a slightly more\u000a        manageable task! Other universities have reported using the site\u000a      `for inspiration' as to what to include, and as a source of figures to\u000a      insert into their lectures. To date 5 universities have confirmed they are\u000a      utilising the material in some form or other (Nottingham, Durham, Surrey,\u000a      Manchester and Bristol) and Hull has indicated they will as soon as an\u000a      appropriate course is rewritten.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Material has been prepared for the Institute of Physics (IOP) to\u000a      disseminate freely to universities worldwide who wish to incorporate\u000a      material into the undergraduate physics curriculum.

She joined the University of Cambridge\u000a      Department of Physics in 1983 where she has held a Professorship since\u000a      1998. Her research on biopolymers started during the 1980s, with very\u000a      significant advances in the area of starch granule structure being made\u000a      during the 1990s in a series of papers [e.g. 1-2]. She co-organised (with\u000a      a pair of industrialists) two major international interdisciplinary\u000a      meetings held in Cambridge in 1996 and 2000, involving both academics and\u000a      industrialists with backgrounds across the research spectrum, from plant\u000a      scientists to food manufacturers. Each conference resulted in the\u000a      publication of a book that she co-edited. The work using microfocus X-ray\u000a      scattering (SAXS) [1] to confirm the radial orientation of the amylopectin\u000a      chains formed the basis of a News and Views article in Nature,\u000a      highlighting the significance of the findings. The model revealed by SAXS\u000a      was capable of identifying subtle differences with composition and between\u000a      species and led to a successful collaboration with plant scientists at the\u000a      John Innes Centre in Norwich e.g. [3] which enabled her to gain a broad\u000a      appreciation of this interdisciplinary interface and be comfortable with\u000a      the biochemical language and an appreciation of genetics and the issues\u000a      surrounding genetic modification. Around this time, the late 1990s, she\u000a      also served on BBSRC's Strategy Board and the Governing Body of the\u000a      Institute of Food Physics, all work which familiarised herself with\u000a      disciplines removed from physics, central to her ability to take oversight\u000a      of a broad-ranging topic such as biological physics teaching. Her more\u000a      recent work on protein aggregation ensures that she has a firm grasp of\u000a      another of the key families of biological molecules [5].\u000a    Dr Pietro Cicuta become a Research Associate in the Department of Physics\u000a      in 2003, became a Research Fellow in 2004 and was appointed to a\u000a      Lectureship in 2006. His research focusses on soft matter and biological\u000a      physics, with a particular emphasis on amphiphilic molecules such as\u000a      lipids, including their interfacial properties [4-6]. By studying the\u000a      thermodynamics of the molecules at interfaces it is possible to establish\u000a      what the fluctuation spectrum of lipid bilayers should be in different\u000a      circumstances and relate that to experimental data on both model and\u000a      biologically-relevant bilayers. In particular by working with giant\u000a      vesicles that mimic the composition of biological cell membranes, it\u000a      becomes possible to understand the coupling between the phase behaviour\u000a      and the membrane properties. This interplay between the thermodynamics and\u000a      the response of the cell membrane is at the heart of the 6 lectures that\u000a      Cicuta has contributed to the project.\u000a    Both Donald and Cicuta have broad experience in a wide range of\u000a      biological physics arenas, covering the major classes of\u000a      biologically-relevant molecules (with the exception of the nucleic acids).\u000a      Due to their complementary interests they have also worked together and in\u000a      2007 wrote a joint invited review of microrheology as relevant to the\u000a      study of soft matter and biophysics.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16779","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Dasher is a fast and easy to learn text-entry interface using natural\u000d\u000a      continuous pointing gestures,\u000d\u000a      so taking advantage of humans' natural ability to make high-speed analogue\u000d\u000a      movements. It can\u000d\u000a      also use button presses, clicking and tapping gestures as input. As well\u000d\u000a      as being faster, it is\u000d\u000a      simpler to use than conventional writing systems and produces considerably\u000d\u000a      fewer errors. In\u000d\u000a      contrast to most writing systems, the Dasher approach enables efficient\u000d\u000a      communication in almost\u000d\u000a      all languages, regardless of alphabet. All that is required is an alphabet\u000d\u000a      file that defines the\u000d\u000a      alphabetical order, and a training text in the target language. Alphabet\u000d\u000a      files have been created for\u000d\u000a      136 languages, and training texts have been produced in 20 European, 4\u000d\u000a      Asian, 15 Indian, 12\u000d\u000a      African, and 3 Middle-Eastern Languages. Special prototypes of Dasher were\u000d\u000a      developed in 2011\u000d\u000a      for writing in Japanese and Chinese, making Dasher's transformational\u000d\u000a      impact on users global.\u000d\u000a    Dasher is an open source product &#8212; the source code was released under the\u000d\u000a      GNU public licence\u000d\u000a      (GPL) in 2002 and all subsequent versions have been issued similarly. This\u000d\u000a      guarantees free\u000d\u000a      access to the Dasher source code, and allows it to be stored in the\u000d\u000a      publicly accessible GNOME\u000d\u000a      repository. Dasher was included in the GNOME 2 desktop in January 2004,\u000d\u000a      and agreement was\u000d\u000a      reached in November 2011 to include it in GNOME 3. The GNOME desktop is\u000d\u000a      the default desktop\u000d\u000a      environment for the Sun MicroSystems (now Oracle) Solaris operating system\u000d\u000a      and most Linux\u000d\u000a      distributions.\u000d\u000a    Since its release, Dasher has been downloaded from the Inference Group\u000d\u000a      website over 120,000\u000d\u000a      times of which 71,000 times since 2008. It has also been included in\u000d\u000a      software packages distributed\u000d\u000a      by others, including Ubuntu, Solaris, and Tobii (who sell gaze-tracking\u000d\u000a      systems).\u000d\u000a    Dasher was designed to use hardware that may be much smaller than\u000d\u000a      conventional keyboards and\u000d\u000a      is therefore particularly useful for smart phones and tablet computers. As\u000d\u000a      a result of the Inference\u000d\u000a      Group's continued research into porting Dasher to mobile devices [Ref 5],\u000d\u000a      Dasher was made\u000d\u000a      available for the Android market and the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad in\u000d\u000a      2010. It has been\u000d\u000a      downloaded to Android devices over 5000 times with a user-review rating of\u000d\u000a      4.2\/5 and from the\u000d\u000a      Apple Store over 400 times since October 2012.\u000d\u000a    Dasher has transformed computing for those unable to use a conventional\u000d\u000a      keyboard because it\u000d\u000a      can be driven using any pointing device, such as a mouse, rollerball,\u000d\u000a      touchpad, joystick or gaze-tracker.\u000d\u000a      Since 2008, significant advances have been made in the usability of Dasher\u000d\u000a      with pointing\u000d\u000a      devices, particularly with gaze-trackers and joysticks. Dasher has proven\u000d\u000a      to be ideally suited to be\u000d\u000a      used with a gaze-tracker as it is mode free: you look at what you are\u000d\u000a      writing, and do not need to\u000d\u000a      escape into an error-correction mode, nor an \"accept-model-predictions\"\u000d\u000a      mode as in systems\u000d\u000a      which offer word-completions. Unlike other systems it is also robust to\u000d\u000a      blinks and can infer and\u000d\u000a      correct poor calibration. Dasher adapts to an individual's writing style\u000d\u000a      to such an extent that it is\u000d\u000a      sometimes possible to write several words using a single glance.\u000d\u000a    One issue which Dasher faced was that commercial gaze-trackers are\u000d\u000a      expensive, and typically use\u000d\u000a      special-purpose high resolution, high frame rate infra-red cameras.

So far, a gesture switch &#8212; an algorithm which learns and\u000d\u000a      detects facial gestures\u000d\u000a      such as \"look up\" or \"smile\" &#8212; and a head tracker suitable for hands-free\u000d\u000a      writing with Dasher have\u000d\u000a      been developed [Ref 6].\u000d\u000a    Dasher can also write text using discrete button presses as input, either\u000d\u000a      by selecting a screen\u000d\u000a      region, or using precise timing information. This feature prompted\u000d\u000a      collaboration with IDRC\u000d\u000a      (Toronto) who developed Tecla, a hardware device which converts wheelchair\u000d\u000a      joystick controls\u000d\u000a      into bluetooth keypresses with an on-screen keyboard to be able to use an\u000d\u000a      Android smart phone\u000d\u000a      using the joystick. As a result of the Inference Group's research [Ref 5],\u000d\u000a      it is now possible to\u000d\u000a      switch between the Tecla on-screen keyboard and Dasher so that writing a\u000d\u000a      text message on a\u000d\u000a      mobile phone using a single wheelchair button and Dasher in a new\u000d\u000a      one-button mode became\u000d\u000a      easy.

The first prototype of the resulting\u000d\u000a      software, Dasher, was\u000d\u000a      released in 1997.\u000d\u000a    In Dasher's zooming interface, the user writes by steering through a\u000d\u000a      continuously-expanding two-dimensional\u000d\u000a      world containing alternative continuations of the text, arranged\u000d\u000a      alphabetically. Dasher\u000d\u000a      was designed to use a language model to predict which letters might come\u000d\u000a      next, and makes those\u000d\u000a      letters easier to write by allocating more space on the screen to them.\u000d\u000a      The language model can be\u000d\u000a      trained on example documents in almost any language, and it adapts to the\u000d\u000a      user's language as\u000d\u000a      s\/he writes. Part of the research of the Dasher project involved enhancing\u000d\u000a      the language model,\u000d\u000a      which is based on a text compression model called prediction by partial\u000d\u000a      match.\u000d\u000a    The early development of Dasher was supported by partnership awards from\u000d\u000a      IBM Zurich research\u000d\u000a      laboratories, awarded in 1999 and 2001. The first research version of\u000d\u000a      Dasher, released in 2002,\u000d\u000a      could be driven by mouse or by gaze-tracker. The record-breaking\u000d\u000a      performance of Dasher with a\u000d\u000a      gaze-tracker was described in Nature in 2002 [Ref 2]. In 2002, the Gatsby\u000d\u000a      Charitable Foundation's\u000d\u000a      interest in the research underpinning Dasher led them to offer funding\u000d\u000a      which continues to support a\u000d\u000a      post of project manager\/developer.

Although the University\u000d\u000aof Glasgow did not commercialise the PDH technique, the researchers were active in the\u000d\u000adissemination of its benefits to audiences both in academia and industry. During the 1990s, the\u000d\u000alaser and gravitational wave communities shared an interest in stable and rugged high power\u000d\u000aoptics and members of the commercial laser community routinely attended scientific conferences\u000d\u000asuch as the 7th Marcel Grossman Conference (Stanford, 1994) where Ward presented results on\u000d\u000athe stability of the University of Glasgow 10m interferometer using PDH locking.\u000d\u000aMoreover, owing to the high profile of the work carried out at Glasgow, the group maintained\u000d\u000acollaborations with leading universities and research institutes worldwide who in turn also trained\u000d\u000astudents, collaborated with industry and engaged in commercial activities providing an international\u000d\u000adimension to the widespread dissemination of the benefits of the PDH technique which ultimately\u000d\u000aled to industrial adoption. For example, the Glasgow group has an historically close link with Prof.\u000d\u000aRobert L. Byer at Stanford University and through him to companies adopting PDH in products. For\u000d\u000aexample, New Focus, (subsequently bought by Newport) was a Stanford spin-out which utilised\u000d\u000aPDH in its products. There were also links between gravitational waves and atom optics groups\u000d\u000aparticularly in Germany and it is from here that companies such as Toptica were founded. Prof.\u000d\u000aHough and Prof. Ted Haensch had close links through working on the Scientific and Technical\u000d\u000aAdvisory Committee for the Virgo interferometric gravitational wave detector in 1994-97. Prof.\u000d\u000aHaensch subsequently founded Menlo Systems in 2001 that produces stable and ultra-stable laser\u000d\u000asystems.\u000d\u000aThe impact of the University of Glasgow work has occurred on three different scales.\u000d\u000aa) Sales of dedicated high-speed frequency\/phase modulators\u000d\u000aImplementation of the PHD technique within specialist research establishments and commercial\u000d\u000aproducts requires the use of dedicated high-speed frequency\/phase modulators that can be\u000d\u000ainserted into the laser beam and highly stable optical cavities to which the frequency of the laser\u000d\u000acan be locked.\u000d\u000aThe global number of units sold every year to enable implementation of PDH stabilisation is\u000d\u000acommercially sensitive but estimates fix revenue at a level of &#163;6-10M per annum. This is broadly\u000d\u000asimilar to revenues generated from sales of complete systems. Companies such as New Focus,\u000d\u000aLeysop, Thorlabs, and Gsaenger have significant sales due to the widespread adoption of the PDH\u000d\u000atechnique and as confirmed by Newport in 2011, who said: \"In particular, Pound Drever Hall (PDH)\u000d\u000ar-f locking has become the accepted standard technique for locking high finesse resonant optical\u000d\u000acavities, and Newport has used it in a range of commercial products. For more than 10 years, New\u000d\u000aFocus and Newport have sold a large number of r-f electro-optic modulators and high stability\u000d\u000acavity mechanics to researchers building PDH systems for laser stabilisation and wavelength\u000d\u000aconversion.\"\u000d\u000ab) Sales of complete laser systems\u000d\u000aComplete laser systems incorporating PDH stabilisation give turn-key output of laser light with\u000d\u000astabilised, and \/ or predetermined frequency. In addition, the PDH technique is central to enhanced\u000d\u000aharmonic conversion of laser frequency (e.g. from IR to visible) where the non-linear optical\u000d\u000aconversion is enhanced within a frequency-matched, resonant cavity.\u000d\u000aCompanies such as Toptica and Sacher Lasertechnik sell green, blue and UV laser systems that\u000d\u000adepend upon PDH. Newport sells a sub-system that is used with the customer's own laser to\u000d\u000aproduce the required light. Menlo Systems has developed an Optical Reference System based on\u000d\u000aPDH stabilisation for use in metrology, high precision spectroscopy and interrogation of optical\u000d\u000aclocks. The reach of this impact is world-wide with the companies above selling into European,\u000d\u000aNorth American, Japanese and Asian markets. The market for relevant lasers in such systems is\u000d\u000acurrently worth in excess of &#163;5M per annum, and totalling between &#163;15M and &#163;20M since 2008.\u000d\u000aOne company alone (Toptica) has sales of PDH-enabled frequency-converted systems, with\u000d\u000acurrent revenue from the sale of approximately 60 systems per annum being estimated at more\u000d\u000athan &#163;3M per annum. Their sales are increasing year on year.\u000d\u000aMoreover quoting from a testimonial from Toptica: \"Laser frequency stabilisation to cavities or\u000d\u000acavity length stabilisation &#8212; both by the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) method &#8212; are important\u000d\u000aapplications of our customers. Commercial adoption of this method was made practicable after\u000d\u000ademonstrations in the mid-90's by the Glasgow group and collaborators that reliable, long-term\u000d\u000alocking of optical systems was possible &#8212; a must for industrial use. Our business benefits from the\u000d\u000aPDH method in mainly three ways...we developed and sell individual Pound-Drever-Hall detector\u000d\u000amodules directly to the market...

In many applications, such as metrology, a stable laser is essential.\u000d\u000aPrior to the developments described here, the use of optical cavities as stable references to which\u000d\u000alasers could be locked in frequency, was limited &#8212; both in terms of the spectral purity of the\u000d\u000aresulting laser light and the duration over which this stability could be maintained. Consequently,\u000d\u000auntil work at the University of Glasgow, the widespread opinion was that optical stabilisation\u000d\u000acavities were impractical for commercial use.\u000d\u000aThe first step in the advancement of the field was the development of the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)\u000d\u000aapproach by the University of Glasgow, the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Colorado\u000d\u000aand Caltech. While the promise of this approach was embodied in the 1983 publication, the\u000d\u000atechnique remained of only academic interest because of the short timescales over which the\u000d\u000astability could be demonstrated.\u000d\u000aThe pivotal transformation of PDH arose from innovative research carried out in the mid-late 1990s\u000d\u000a[1-4] at the University of Glasgow by Professor Jim Hough (Lecturer 1972-83, Senior Lecturer\u000d\u000a1983-86, Professor 1986-current), Dr Henry (Harry) Ward (Lecturer 1989-95, Senior Lecturer\u000d\u000a1995-current) and Professor Ken Strain (PPARC Adv. Fellow 1995-99, Lecturer 1999-2003,\u000d\u000aProfessor 2003-present). This research showed for the first time that stable operation over long\u000d\u000aperiods of time was possible. The robustness of PDH as applied to gravitational wave detection\u000d\u000aestablished the viability of the method for use in realistic applications. For example, the paper by\u000d\u000aRobertson, Strain, Hough and Ward et al. [3] reported excellent performance of highly stabilised\u000d\u000aoptical cavities obtained using the PDH technique. Moreover, the group further demonstrated and\u000d\u000aassessed the robustness and long-term stability of an optical system using multiple instances of\u000d\u000athis technique [4] and published a demonstration that the technique could be completely\u000d\u000aautomated [1].\u000d\u000aThe demonstration and promotion of this research had two direct consequences. The first was the\u000d\u000aadoption of the technique as the state-of-the-art (which it remains) in laser research laboratories\u000d\u000aaround the globe. The second was the adoption of this technique by industry, where the key\u000d\u000ademonstration of its automation and robustness led to the desire to incorporate PDH into\u000d\u000acommercial products, (particularly in the frequency doubling of light) starting in the late 1990s and\u000d\u000acontinuing today.\u000d\u000aAlthough lasers had been widespread since the 1970s, only certain wavelengths were available. In\u000d\u000aparticular, lasers in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum were difficult to obtain. Blue and UV\u000d\u000awavelengths required for metrology applications can often only be produced by second harmonic\u000d\u000ageneration by frequency doubling of a visible or near-infra red laser in a non-linear crystal within an\u000d\u000aoptical cavity. To ensure that the frequency doubling works, the laser frequency must exactly\u000d\u000amatch the peak of the cavity resonance and the PDH technique is the best way to achieve this. It\u000d\u000awas not until the research reported by the University of Glasgow in the mid 1990s that the\u000d\u000arobustness and long-term stability of this frequency matching was realised.\u000d\u000aFurthermore, the PDH technique is particularly suited to diode lasers as the frequency modulation\u000d\u000aused can be directly applied to the drive current of the laser without the need for an external\u000d\u000amodulator. There are a number of niche markets for these systems where a particular wavelength\u000d\u000ais required or a continuous wave laser at a short wavelength is necessary.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"17682","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Public outreach and education: Astronomy's\u000a          New Messengers\u000a    In 2009 the Education and Public Outreach Group of the LSC was awarded\u000a      $950,000 by the US National Science Foundation for a project called\u000a      Astronomy's New Messengers. Hendry was co-Principal Investigator and the\u000a      only PI from Europe, working with colleagues from Columbia, Florida,\u000a      Michigan and Mississippi. The team successfully designed and built a\u000a      20-metre2touring exhibition on gravitational-wave astronomy,\u000a      which premiered at the 2009 World Science Festival in New York, together\u000a      with a 100-metre2 version that subsequently premiered at the\u000a      2010 World Science Festival. The exhibits combined state-of-the-art\u000a      multimedia, a working table-top Michelson interferometer and Black Hole\u000a      Hunter: a `Citizen Science'-style interactive computer game. The larger\u000a      exhibit also featured an innovative, interactive light sculpture &#8212; created\u000a      by the award-winning New York lighting designer Leni Schwendinger &#8212; that\u000a      represented the signals from different types of gravitational wave\u000a      sources.

Drawing directly upon his cosmology and\u000a      gravitational astrophysics research expertise, and IGR's experience in\u000a      building \"Can you hear black holes?\" for the 2008 Royal Society\u000a      Exhibition, Hendry wrote text for the exhibition panels (including\u000a      material on the Big Bang and the scale of the cosmos), assisted with\u000a      designing the table-top Michelson interferometer, edited and installed the\u000a      Black Hole Hunter game and helped design the multimedia displays. He also\u000a      established the partnership with Leni Schwendinger.\u000a    The gravitational-wave astronomy exhibition (both 20-metre2\u000a      and 100-metre2 versions) has been displayed in over 20\u000a      locations across 15 US states to date. In addition to the World Science\u000a      Festivals in New York, they featured in the 2010 and 2012 US National\u000a      Science and Engineering Expos in Washington DC. Total participation at\u000a      each World Science Festival and each National Science and Engineering Expo\u000a      was estimated by their organisers at 150,000 and 500,000 respectively -\u000a      indicating the scale of the events in which the exhibits have been\u000a      showcased. Exact numbers of visitors to our exhibit have not been recorded\u000a      at every venue. For example at the US National Science and Engineering\u000a      Expos our exhibit was part of an open-plan exhibition space on the\u000a      National Mall (2010) and the Washington Convention Center (2012). At the\u000a      2010 World Science Festival in New York, however, the large exhibit was\u000a      displayed at its own venue on Wall St where exact audience figures could\u000a      be recorded. It was visited by nearly 6,000 people. The touring exhibit\u000a      was estimated to have been seen by around 40,000 people at the Adler\u000a      Planetarium (Chicago) in 2009, when it was located in the entrance foyer\u000a      of the Planetarium. A parallel version of the exhibit has also been\u000a      displayed at venues in the UK, including at the 2012 Gravity Fields\u000a      Festival in Grantham (where Hendry was interviewed by 'The Material World'\u000a      on Radio 4) and most recently at the flagship BBC Scotland event for 2013\u000a      Stargazing Live at Glasgow's Botanical Gardens, attended by 4,500 people.\u000a    The aim of Astronomy's New Messengers was to engage adolescents and young\u000a      adults, increasing their interest in, and understanding of,\u000a      gravitational-wave astronomy and LIGO science.

As a consequence, there is an\u000a      increasing demand for laboratory techniques able to image materials and\u000a      map their properties (e.g. composition and chemistry) down to atomic\u000a      resolution. Aberration-corrected electron microscopy provides the atomic\u000a      spatial resolution and information on structure, boundaries and defects,\u000a      while EELS and x-ray spectroscopy provide information on the composition\u000a      and chemistry in perfect spatial registration.\u000a    Gatan Inc. was established almost 50 years ago and is considered the\u000a      world's leading supplier of analytical equipment and software for\u000a      enhancing and extending the operation of electron microscopes. Gatan's\u000a      products are designed to fit all major brands of transmission and scanning\u000a      electron microscopes and to provide users with extended features ranging\u000a      from specimen preparation to imaging and analysis. The company has\u000a      extensive market penetration in industry and academia. Gatan supplies over\u000a      80% of all new EELS systems worldwide. In the general context of\u000a      intermediate voltage (200\/300kV) TEMs, Gatan analytical products are found\u000a      on over 30% of all such instruments delivered in 2012.\u000a    Information obtained by DualEELS&#8482; is crucial to the development of future\u000a      materials and devices needed to provide the next generation of disruptive\u000a      technologies that will allow the phenomenal improvement in performance\u000a      seen in recent times e.g. as in Moore's Law in the computer field. The\u000a      industries supplying computer components are key examples. The Si (O,N)\u000a      gate dielectric layer in current Si-based MOSFETS used in applications\u000a      such as computer CPUs has only ~5 Si atoms across it. The oxide layer in a\u000a      spin tunnel junction used in the read head of a magnetic hard disc is only\u000a      5 to 10 atoms across. Hence development of new products and routine\u000a      quality control and failure analysis for production of existing products\u000a      in these multibillion dollar industries require techniques able to produce\u000a      atomic scale information on the structure, composition and chemistry of\u000a      the materials used. The importance of DualEELS&#8482; in this field is\u000a      demonstrated by a joint presentation by AMD and Gatan at the Electronic\u000a      Device Failure Analysis (EDFA) Lonestar meeting in April 2013 entitled \"High-speed\u000a        EELS Analysis of Semiconductor Devices\". This presentation clearly\u000a      demonstrates the major advantages provided by DualEELS&#8482; in this area and\u000a      explains its enthusiastic adoption by this sector.\u000a    Other sectors where materials analysis at the nanoscale is crucial and\u000a      where DualEELS&#8482; is being used include catalysis, ceramics and metals,\u000a      among many others.\u000a    The main benefit of using EELS is the ability to obtain fully\u000a      quantitative information about a wide range of material properties such as\u000a      the local thickness, dielectric function, material bandgap,\u000a      electromagnetic excitation modes of nanoparticles, relative composition,\u000a      absolute number of atoms per area and per volume, the local chemistry and\u000a      both the charge and magnetic state of ions. However, the ability to\u000a      extract all this information is dependent on the acquisition of the whole\u000a      energy loss range under the same experimental conditions to ensure\u000a      accurate energy calibration and to allow correction for the effect of\u000a      multiple inelastic events and for elastic scattering outside the\u000a      spectrometer. DualEELS&#8482; provides this capability for fast spectrum\u000a      imaging. The fast shutter also makes operation of the whole microscope\u000a      system much easier. For instance, the STEM imaging conditions can be set\u000a      independently of the spectrometer conditions, which is crucial at atomic\u000a      resolution, since any change in the optics requires the corrector to be\u000a      re-tuned, which takes a very significant time.\u000a    In response to customer demand, in 2009 Gatan launched its GIF QUANTUM&#174;\u000a      electron spectroscopy system, the first instrument on the market to\u000a      incorporate the Glasgow DualEELS&#8482; concept and electrostatic shutter along\u000a      with a range of other new innovative features from Gatan. Following the\u000a      GIF QUANTUM&#174; success, Gatan launched the ENFINIUM&#174;\u000a      system in 2011 to meet the demands of another, more specialised segment of\u000a      the electron microscopy market. DualEELS&#8482; in these systems can record over\u000a      1000 spectra\/sec and so 1000 x 1000 pixel spectrum images can be recorded\u000a      in as little as 20 minutes and smaller ones correspondingly faster. Thus\u000a      data from regions containing key features such as precipitates,\u000a      interfaces, boundaries or defects can be recorded down to atomic\u000a      resolution in realistic times. As an example, such information is of\u000a      particular relevance in the development of novel materials such as\u000a      multiferroic oxides which couple electric and magnetic ordering with\u000a      potential for sensors, actuators and data storage.\u000a    The GIF QUANTUM&#174; and ENFINIUM&#174; are extremely\u000a      successful product lines for Gatan, resulting in an increase in the number\u000a      of installation\/maintenance engineers of ~10% worldwide and a similar\u000a      increase in support staff in production. The list price for the GIF\u000a      QUANTUM&#174; is in the range US$510k &#8212; 820k depending on the model.\u000a      Gatan sold over 65 GIF QUANTUM&#174; systems to customers worldwide\u000a      in 2010 and over 80 in 2011 and the numbers continue to rise. More than\u000a      70% of systems requested by customers in 2012 have the DualEELS&#8482; options.\u000a      In terms of sector breakdown, roughly 50% of systems are purchased by\u000a      universities, 25% by research institutes and 25% by industry. The biggest\u000a      segments of the industrial market are semiconductors (AMD, Intel,\u000a      Samsung), data storage (WD, IBM, TDK) and catalysis (Michelin, Corning).\u000a      Although the direct economic impact of Glasgow's research to Gatan is\u000a      easily quantifiable, it is much harder to map how this has spread to the\u000a      broader user community and how the technique has enabled not only new\u000a      scientific discoveries but also improved processes and products in\u000a      different industrial sectors.\u000a    While major companies in sectors such as semiconductors, data storage and\u000a      catalysis can justify the purchase of DualEELS&#8482; systems, many others\u000a      require the information and analysis possibilities they offer. We give two\u000a      examples of companies who have extended their capabilities using Glasgow's\u000a      DualEELS&#8482; system.\u000a    The zirconium alloy, Zircaloy, is of huge significance to the safe\u000a      containment of highly radioactive nuclear fuels in power generation\u000a      systems. Understanding the corrosion process at the nanoscale in Zircaloy\u000a      is key input to predictive modelling of the safe operating lifespan of the\u000a      current generation of nuclear reactors. In collaboration with Dr Gass of\u000a      AMEC, we have used the DualEELS&#8482; system in Glasgow to give previously\u000a      unobtainable information on the reaction layers formed in the complex\u000a      oxidation process by which Zircaloy corrodes in a pressurised water\u000a      reactor. Using such information to validate predictive models of safe\u000a      operating lifespan is a crucial step in achieving the aim of energy\u000a      company, EDF, to extend the lifetime of the Sizewell B nuclear reactor by\u000a      20 years.\u000a    The second example is the study of precipitation in high manganese\u000a      steels, in collaboration with ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe AG. Using our\u000a      DualEELS&#8482; system, we have developed a new technique that allows us to gain\u000a      key information on the precipitate when in situ in the matrix. This not\u000a      only gives information on the structure, composition and chemistry of\u000a      nanometre sized precipitates but also their size in three dimensions,\u000a      allowing their relationship to the surrounding steel matrix and its\u000a      defects to be studied. Such information is essential to allow the\u000a      development and validation of accurate models relating processing to\u000a      nanostructure so that suitable precipitate distributions for optimal\u000a      mechanical properties are achieved. This will play a key part in the\u000a      development of high strength steels for the automotive industry leading to\u000a      more fuel-efficient transport.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    DualEELS&#8482; is a recent advance in Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS)\u000a      made possible by a successful collaboration between the University of\u000a      Glasgow and Gatan, the world leader in electron spectroscopy systems for\u000a      electron microscopy.

In a\u000a      technique known as spectrum imaging, an electron probe is scanned over an\u000a      ultra-thin (&lt;100nm) specimen with the signals of interest (e.g. an EELS\u000a      spectrum, an x-ray spectrum, scattered electron intensities) recorded at\u000a      each pixel. The information obtained from EELS includes local thickness,\u000a      dielectric function, composition, local atomic environment, absolute\u000a      numbers of atoms\/area and absolute numbers of atoms\/volume. Since the\u000a      electron probe can be smaller than the interatomic spacing, such\u000a      information can be extracted and mapped down to atomic resolution in a\u000a      large range of scientifically and technologically important areas\u000a      including semiconductors, data storage and catalysis.\u000a    In the energy loss range required to provide information on all elements\u000a      (0 to 3kV), the dynamic range of the signal is very high (~105).\u000a      Prior to DualEELS&#8482;, magnetic deflection coils were used to provide the\u000a      shutter to control the number of electrons reaching the spectrometer, but\u000a      their slow response time (msecs) limited the minimum exposure. Obtaining\u000a      the entire spectrum required at least two scans with different optical\u000a      conditions. This was not only time-consuming but presented serious\u000a      disadvantages in maintaining the spatial registration of the data at the\u000a      atomic scale.\u000a    Prof A J Craven (Lecturer, 1978-89; Senior Lecturer, 1989-92; Reader,\u000a      1992-98; Professor of Physics 1998-2012) recognised that a fast\u000a      electrostatic shutter could control the exposure in a way that allowed the\u000a      entire spectrum to be recorded without changing the optical conditions.\u000a      With Dr W A P Nicholson (Research Technologist 1979-2005) and Dr J A\u000a      Wilson (Postdoctoral Research Assistant [PDRA] 1999-2007), a prototype\u000a      electrostatic shutter was developed. The results were reported in a 2002\u000a      paper [1], demonstrating the shutter had a time constant of 10nsec,\u000a      allowing the system to settle to its full energy resolution in under\u000a      100nsec. The paper also showed that data could be recorded over the whole\u000a      energy range of interest and proposed the concept of recording the entire\u000a      EELS spectrum at each pixel in the spectrum image, the concept at the core\u000a      of what has since become known as DualEELS&#8482;.\u000a    By 2005, there was significant interest among the scientific community in\u000a      Glasgow's new concept. In the autumn of 2005, Gatan decided to undertake a\u000a      major development of their spectrometer system and wished to incorporate\u000a      the DualEELS&#8482; concept. They collaborated with Glasgow University to\u000a      develop a proof-of-principle DualEELS&#8482; system to demonstrate the potential\u000a      benefits for wider commercialisation and identify issues that needed to be\u000a      addressed. The project capitalised on equipment already installed at the\u000a      University of Glasgow and on the fast shutter developed by Prof Craven's\u000a      research group. Gatan provided the software necessary to control the\u000a      hardware and acquire and process the data.\u000a    The Glasgow team was led by Prof Craven and comprised Dr M MacKenzie\u000a      (PDRA 2001-2008), Dr S McFadzean (Technician 1978-current), Dr Nicholson\u000a      and Dr J Scott (PDRA 2001-2007). The results were published in 2008 [2].\u000a      The project demonstrated for the first time a system capable of recording\u000a      a spectrum image which, at each pixel, gave the image signals, two EELS\u000a      spectra (a low and a high energy loss range with very different signal\u000a      levels) and an x-ray spectrum, while allowing all the existing features of\u000a      the Gatan EELS system to remain available to the user. It demonstrated\u000a      that the EELS spectrum could be accurately calibrated for energy, the\u000a      multiple scattering removed, local thickness determined, signals from both\u000a      low and high atomic elements recorded and the absolute number of atoms per\u000a      area and volume extracted. It also identified an issue with the efficiency\u000a      of the EELS acquisition which Gatan were subsequently able to overcome.\u000a      This demonstration generated considerable interest in the potential market\u000a      and resulted in the launch of the GIF QUANTUM&#174; and ENFINIUM&#174;\u000a      systems.

The company offers a\u000d\u000a      range of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) instruments, which are sold to customers\u000d\u000a      worldwide both in academia and industry. XRD is a non-destructive\u000d\u000a      analytical technique used to determine the crystalline structure and\u000d\u000a      elemental composition of materials. Its applications range from\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals and petrochemical to semiconductor, electronics, and\u000d\u000a      nanotechnology. XRD is a particularly versatile technique as it can\u000d\u000a      provide information on the chemical and physical characteristics of a\u000d\u000a      range of materials including powders, thin films or bulk materials.\u000d\u000a    The Medipix2 collaboration secured a Collaboration Agreement with\u000d\u000a      PANalytical in 2001, and the company supported the development of the\u000d\u000a      Medipix2 chip in return for exclusive rights to commercialise the\u000d\u000a      resulting technology in its new Empyrean product line. The company\u000d\u000a      successfully launched the first PIXcel product in 2007. Today, PANalytical\u000d\u000a      sells three different products based on the Medipix2 pixelated detector.\u000d\u000a      The introduction of a series of PIXcel detectors (PIXcel1D,\u000d\u000a      PIXcel3D and PIXcel3D\u000d\u000a      2x2) has added new dimensions to XRD analysis. With this complete series\u000d\u000a      of detectors users can obtain the best available data quality. This\u000d\u000a      technology breakthrough required sustained input for approximately 8 years\u000d\u000a      from the Medipix collaboration before yielding mature, marketable\u000d\u000a      products.\u000d\u000a    PANalytical's PIXcel, offers a number of distinct advantages over its\u000d\u000a      competitors. First, it is uniquely adaptable, being the only detector on\u000d\u000a      the market that can operate as a point-, linear-, 2-D or 3-D detector, all\u000d\u000a      in one. This adaptability is complemented by its high spatial resolution,\u000d\u000a      high dynamic range and low noise, which make PIXcel the most advanced\u000d\u000a      photon counting detector in the world.\u000d\u000a    The PIXcel3D X-ray detector offers flexibility\u000d\u000a      and performance that sets it apart from all competing systems, which use\u000d\u000a      separate detectors to cover the same range, thus increasing the cost.\u000d\u000a      PIXcel's all-in-one capabilities are more cost-effective, allowing modes\u000d\u000a      that were so far only available at large synchrotron facilities. In 2011,\u000d\u000a      Empyrean, the product line of XRD systems incorporating PIXcel, won an\u000d\u000a      award for the best technology innovation from R&amp;D Magazine. It\u000d\u000a      continues to be a very successful product line that is well received by\u000d\u000a      customers.\u000d\u000a    In 2013, PANalytical introduced a further innovation to its Empyrean\u000d\u000a      product line: the ability to perform grazing incidence small-angle X-ray\u000d\u000a      scattering (GISAXS). GISAXS is a technique that is used to investigate the\u000d\u000a      physical and chemical properties of nanostructured thin films. However, as\u000d\u000a      an advanced analytical technique, it is traditionally restricted to users\u000d\u000a      of synchrotron beam lines.\u000d\u000a    Thanks to the high efficiency and low noise of the Medipix2 detector,\u000d\u000a      high quality images can be obtained even using laboratory sources with\u000d\u000a      intensity orders of magnitude lower than that from a synchrotron beam. As\u000d\u000a      nanomaterials become more widespread in a number of applications,\u000d\u000a      affordable and convenient access to this technology is of great advantage\u000d\u000a      to users both in academia and industry.\u000d\u000a    The PANalytical XRD Product Marketing Manager said: \"We are very proud to\u000d\u000a      be a commercial partner in Medipix2.

These hybrid pixel detectors combine a CMOS\u000d\u000a      chip and an array of readout electronics channels, connected via micro\u000d\u000a      bump bonds to an identically segmented sensor chip. The primary motivation\u000d\u000a      was to develop a 2-D detector capable of time stamping high energy physics\u000d\u000a      (HEP) events at the expected 40MHz collision rate of the LHC. In the\u000d\u000a      course of this research, it became clear that such a technology could also\u000d\u000a      be useful in medical imaging [1].\u000d\u000a    The Glasgow group identified the need for new technology in X-ray imaging\u000d\u000a      as being particularly significant. In photon counting mode, the Medipix\u000d\u000a      chip could deliver significant advances in the detection of X-ray\u000d\u000a      diffraction patterns. The Glasgow team demonstrated this for the first\u000d\u000a      time, using hybrid pixel detectors at a synchrotron X-ray source [2]. The\u000d\u000a      Omega3 chip, a predecessor of Medipix, was used in this early work, and it\u000d\u000a      was repeated with the Medipix chip when it became available.\u000d\u000a    However, to be useful for medical and other imaging applications, the\u000d\u000a      electronics readout chip would have to be adapted to produce X-ray images\u000d\u000a      which are high resolution and noise-free. From the starting point of this\u000d\u000a      pioneering Medipix1 chip in 1997 grew the design brief of what was to\u000d\u000a      become the Medipix2 chip produced in 2001 and now at the core of the\u000d\u000a      PIXcel detector. This brief was outlined by the Glasgow research team\u000d\u000a      including Dr R Bates (Research Associate 1999-2007 and Research Fellow\u000d\u000a      2007-present), Dr S D'Auria (Research Associate 1999-2010 and Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow 2010-present) and Dr C Raine (Research Assistance 1980-98), along\u000d\u000a      with teams from Freiburg, Pisa and the European Organization for Nuclear\u000d\u000a      Research (CERN). The Glasgow group effort was led by Prof K Smith\u000d\u000a      (Lecturer\/Reader 1963-93, Professor 1993-2003) from 1991 until 2003 and\u000d\u000a      since then by Prof V O'Shea (Research Associate 1992-2005, Lecturer\u000d\u000a      2005-2010, Professor 2010-present). Glasgow brought design engineering\u000d\u000a      expertise to the Medipix ASIC design group and performed much of the\u000d\u000a      initial characterisation of the Medipix1 chip.\u000d\u000a    As interest in medical imaging applications grew and the collaboration\u000d\u000a      expanded, it became possible to consider a more advanced chip design\u000d\u000a      involving simultaneously shrinking the pixel size, increasing its\u000d\u000a      complexity and increasing the number of pixels, which resulted in the\u000d\u000a      Medipix2 chip. Seventeen institutions contributed ideas to the Medipix2\u000d\u000a      readout chips, pixel sensors design, characterisation of the pixel modules\u000d\u000a      and applications of the Medipix2 chips. The Glasgow team contributed to\u000d\u000a      the chip design, including the features necessary to make it an efficient,\u000d\u000a      high-resolution photon-counting device. The Glasgow team also tested and\u000d\u000a      characterised the Medipix2 chip, studying novel sensor materials (GaAs,\u000d\u000a      CdTe) and structures (3-D Si) for a variety of applications. As a\u000d\u000a      consequence of these and other studies [3], further developments of the\u000d\u000a      technology were made resulting in the Medipix3 chip. Today, the Medipix\u000d\u000a      family of hybrid pixel detectors are used for medical imaging including\u000d\u000a      computer tomography scans, material analysis including pharmaceuticals,\u000d\u000a      nuclear power plant decommissioning and astronomical adaptive optics.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aFigure 1: A picture and schematic diagram of the high-sensitivity, low-noise Medipix2 chip.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18035","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The NSO is a web-based resource set up by LJMU to exploit the educational\u000a      and engagement potential of the Liverpool Telescope (LT) [Source 2].\u000a      The target audiences are pupils in UK and Irish schools of ages 8 to 18\u000a      and their teachers, and since its launch in 2004 has reached more than\u000a      4,000 registered UK and Irish teachers, with 60,000 sets of observations\u000a      requested by schools (growing from 2,700 requests in 2004\/5, to around\u000a      1,500 per month in 2013) and around 1.5 - 2 million webpages served each\u000a      year (the majority within the UK, but with a growing usage\u000a      internationally) [Source 3].

Using a mixture of online questionnaires and visits to\u000a      schools, the evaluation showed that both pupils and teachers are \"highly\u000a      positive\" of all aspects of the NSO and, in particular, that as well as\u000a      enhancing astronomy and science education, use of the NSO has given pupils\u000a      \"more insight into the work of scientists\" (68% of teachers agree or\u000a      strongly agree, with &lt; 6% disagreeing) and made them \"more interested\u000a      in science\" (&gt;80% agree or strongly agree, with only 4% disagreeing).\u000a      In summary, the Sheffield Hallam academics concluded that the NSO \"has\u000a      unprecedented reach, and is one of the most significant educational\u000a      initiatives in the STEM field linked to an HEI\" [Source 4].\u000a    These results are supported by internal evaluations and feedback from\u000a      users: \"It is much more involving than just using images that come from\u000a      the internet\" (Bethanie, age 16), \"[It] gave me a real insight into\u000a      physics and made me decide on what I wanted to do at degree level. Now I\u000a      will be studying a Physics and Astronomy degree\" (Simon, age 17), \"[The\u000a      NSO] gives us a powerful platform from which to proceed with inspiring\u000a      students in science through astronomy.\" (Sarah, teacher).\u000a    As is clearly highlighted by this evaluation and feedback, the links with\u000a      research are invaluable for achieving the impact. We have, therefore, an\u000a      ongoing programme of developing research-led projects that are open to\u000a      anyone and pupil-focussed, but which derive from and support LJMU\u000a      research. These include the extra-galactic novae [Refs 4,5] and\u000a      exoplanet search [Ref 6] projects mentioned in Section 2. Other\u000a      projects include following and measuring the light curves of supernovae\u000a      and measuring the positions and orbits of asteroids that as Near-Earth\u000a      Objects might in future collide with Earth.\u000a    Recognition that the NSO's activities have had an important impact comes\u000a      from a variety of sources beyond academic studies. Following advice from\u000a      NSO Director Newsam, the Controlled Assessment (i.e. assessed coursework)\u000a      of the GCSE in Astronomy was redesigned to enable students to use\u000a      robotic telescopes, with the NSO cited as an exemplar in support material\u000a      produced by the exam board Edexcel (now Pearsons). Working with partners\u000a      across Europe (e.g. CERN, The European Physical Society and the Austrian\u000a      Ministry of Education) the NSO has been actively engaged in several\u000a      European projects looking at innovative use of technology in\u000a      research-driven education (e.g. the SkyWatch, Discover the\u000a        Cosmos and Open Discovery Space projects). The NSO also\u000a      forms a key part of a recommendation by the House of Commons Science and\u000a      Technology Select Committee to develop collaboration between BIS and DfE,\u000a      recognising the importance of linking scientific research and education at\u000a      the highest level. Finally, LJMU was awarded a Queen's Anniversary Prize\u000a      in 2005 in recognition of the educational impact of the Liverpool\u000a      Telescope [Source 5].\u000a    In summary, the NSO is a research-led project that, to quote the Royal\u000a      Anniversary Trust in their announcement of the 2005 Queen's Anniversary\u000a      Prize, \"is opening [astronomy] up to schools and enthusing large numbers\u000a      of young people about the study of science and technology\".\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The National Schools' Observatory (NSO) is a web-based resource based at\u000a      LJMU that gives UK and Irish schools free access to their own observations\u000a      from the world's largest fully-robotic telescope &#8212; the Liverpool\u000a      Telescope. Giving its participants unique and privileged access not only\u000a      to the instrument itself, but also to the astronomical research carried\u000a      out by the telescope, the NSO is a powerful blend of cutting-edge\u000a      research, professional instrumentation and education that inspires,\u000a      motivates and supports the learning of pupils of all ages and their\u000a      teachers.

Some of the variations are fast and take\u000a      place in hours to seconds or less, indicating that the objects are small.\u000a      Yet their effects can be seen across space, indicating that the energy\u000a      involved is large, and therefore that the physics is extreme. This\u000a      motivated need for a time-domain branch of astrophysics has led to the\u000a      development of robotic telescopes with a rapid response capability, with\u000a      the Liverpool Telescope (LT) as a leading example. The early stages of the\u000a      LT and its design can be traced back to the mid 1990s, when the scientific\u000a      drivers behind and requirements of robotic telescopes were first clearly\u000a      set out. From these initial seeds a detailed design was developed,\u000a      including important advances in the scheduling systems and algorithms that\u000a      are the key to the scientific power of robotic telescopes (see, for\u000a      example, [Ref 1] (Steele: LT Director 2005-present, Carter: LT\u000a      Project Scientist 1996-2005).\u000a    From the very start of the design process, it was realised that robotic\u000a      telescopes facilitated new ways of remotely operating observatories, and\u000a      opened them up to new communities, such as schools, whose pupils and\u000a      teachers could not travel to distant mountains. Thus a strong driver for\u000a      the LT project was to use the facility as an educational tool (at primary\u000a      and secondary levels) by providing dedicated time and support (in the form\u000a      of the NSO) as seen in [Ref 2] which brings together the expertise\u000a      of Steele, Newsam (NSO Astronomer 1998-2006, NSO Director 2006-present)\u000a      and Mottram (LT Software Engineer 1998-present). The result is a telescope\u000a      and scheduling system that not only produces high-quality science data for\u000a      a variety of science programmes but seamlessly supports non-professional\u000a      use.\u000a    At its simplest level, the NSO uses the LT as an educational toy, with\u000a      which even the youngest students can take their own images of planets,\u000a      nebulae and galaxies and process them. The LT acts as a mind-expanding\u000a      motivational facility for such students, thrilled by their participation\u000a      in astronomy with a large, professional telescope in an exotic location.\u000a    At the next level, the NSO provides the raw material for exercises such\u000a      as measuring the height of lunar mountains through the trigonometry of\u000a      shadows.\u000a    At the most advanced level, since 2008, the NSO has provided an\u000a      opportunity for students to participate in cutting-edge research, making\u000a      observations that contribute to a research frontier, in areas as diverse\u000a      as cataclysmic exploding stars such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts\u000a      (e.g. [Ref 3]), novae [Ref 4], and transits of stars by\u000a      exoplanets [Ref 6]. The educational use of the telescope grew, not\u000a      just alongside the science programmes, but was directly influenced by (and\u000a      influencing) them. Two exemplars will help to show the range of\u000a      connections between research and impact.\u000a    The first concerns extra-galactic novae. Several LJMU researchers are\u000a      involved in a variety of surveys to detect and study such novae including\u000a      [Ref 4] and [Ref 5] which use two different techniques to\u000a      collect as broad a set of data as possible. This expertise was brought\u000a      together with the resources of the NSO to develop a combined\u000a      research\/education project that enables students to hunt for novae in the\u000a      galaxy M81.\u000a    The second example grows from collaboration between the LT and SuperWASP\u000a      [Ref 6] to develop the high-time resolution, high-precision\u000a      photometric instrument needed to follow-up potential exoplanet candidates,\u000a      adding significant information to what is known about them. The\u000a      instrument, RISE, has since been used in the study of a number of\u000a      individual exoplanets (e.g. [Ref 6]) and has also led to an\u000a      ongoing project where SuperWASP candidates are studied exclusively by\u000a      schools and pupils using data from the LT in the search for new\u000a      exoplanets.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18043","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Spaceport is an Astronomy and Space visitor centre based adjacent to one\u000d\u000a      of the three terminals for the Mersey Ferry (which is the top paid-for\u000d\u000a      tourist attraction in the Liverpool area). It is a joint venture between\u000d\u000a      Merseytravel, the mass-transit authority for Merseyside, and LJMU.\u000d\u000a      Spaceport grew from a merger of the aims of the two entities: LJMU desired\u000d\u000a      to enhance the public engagement with its research, the Liverpool\u000d\u000a      Telescope project, and astronomy and space exploration in general.\u000d\u000a      Merseytravel wished to exploit a historic asset and develop education and\u000d\u000a      tourism in the area. Merseytravel was an ideal partner for us as they are\u000d\u000a      a leading organisation in the region for tourism ventures, sharing a\u000d\u000a      similar educational vision.\u000d\u000a    Spaceport has the aim of enhancing the regeneration of the Seacombe and\u000d\u000a      Birkenhead areas on the banks of the Mersey. The Spaceport business plan\u000d\u000a      was based originally on predicted visitor numbers of 90,000 in the first\u000d\u000a      year (2005\/06), dropping gradually to 50,000 (as seen in comparable\u000d\u000a      attractions). However, numbers have remained high, stabilising at around\u000d\u000a      70,000 per year (2012\/13) [Source 1]. This attests both to the\u000d\u000a      quality of the centre and the appeal of the subject area. Using a standard\u000d\u000a      model for measuring the economic activity of tourism (STEAM model 2010, [Source\u000a        2]), this equates to a net gain of more than &#163;2M per year. Spaceport\u000d\u000a      also contributed towards the success of Mersey Ferries being ranked 1st in\u000d\u000a      the City Region in 2008, when Liverpool was European Capital of Culture.\u000d\u000a      Because of this success, the original targets for the regeneration have\u000d\u000a      been met or exceeded. These included the creation of an estimated 50 new\u000d\u000a      jobs, both direct and indirect, which equates to a gross value added of\u000d\u000a      &#163;1.4M p.a. to the City Region [Source 3].\u000d\u000a    LJMU research has had a significant impact on all areas of Spaceport from\u000d\u000a      its conception. Prior to the opening of the centre in 2005, astronomers\u000d\u000a      from the ARI were involved in all stages of the design process for the\u000d\u000a      attraction, from the tender process through to final \"signing off\". That\u000d\u000a      relationship has been maintained, with continuing impact deriving from\u000d\u000a      access to the combined skills, knowledge and experience of a broad-based\u000d\u000a      research-active department that feeds into the centre to make it relevant,\u000d\u000a      current and exciting.\u000d\u000a    Most importantly, Spaceport is designed (through its exhibits and\u000d\u000a      activities) specifically to allow the staff at ARI to engage with a range\u000d\u000a      of different audiences. For example, the annual Merseyside Astronomy Day\u000d\u000a      combines a series of talks by professional astronomers with a day-out at\u000d\u000a      Spaceport. As well as organising the event, which has run near Easter\u000d\u000a      every year since 2006, LJMU provides the majority of the speakers.\u000d\u000a      Subjects have included stellar evolution (Salaris, May 2012), supernovae\u000d\u000a      (Davies, April 2013), telescope development (Steele, March 2009), active\u000d\u000a      galaxies (Mundell, April 2013) and cosmology (Collins, April 2008). The\u000d\u000a      event has sold out every year and receives consistently excellent feedback\u000d\u000a      (100% would recommend friends to come to the next event).\u000d\u000a    As part of its continuing commitment to public engagement, the University\u000d\u000a      recently (2012-13) invested &#163;75k in developing a new interactive exhibit:\u000d\u000a      The Observatory. This was developed during 2012-2013 and was devised by\u000d\u000a      LJMU researchers. It brings the latest research and educational data from\u000d\u000a      the LT into Spaceport where visitors can explore and interact with it. The\u000d\u000a      exhibit was launched in July 2013, and will be constantly refreshed by the\u000d\u000a      ARI with ongoing research, including immediate access to time-critical\u000d\u000a      observations from the LT (such as discovery and follow-up of Gamma Ray\u000d\u000a      Bursts and supernovae - Mundell, Bersier) and their interpretation and\u000d\u000a      importance. Initial evaluation of The Observatory (immediately pre-launch)\u000d\u000a      shows that this immediacy and connection to current research is an\u000d\u000a      important factor in its appeal. We will be continuing the evaluation as\u000d\u000a      the exhibit is enhanced to ensure that this impact is maintained.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the economic benefits, Spaceport forms a key strand of our\u000d\u000a      schools' outreach programme, and is a recognised `public face' of the\u000d\u000a      National Schools' Observatory. Input from LJMU has led to a good mixture\u000d\u000a      of cutting-edge astronomy and curriculum-centred content, both in the\u000d\u000a      exhibits themselves, and in the teacher packs and support material. This\u000d\u000a      has ensured that Spaceport is now a prime destination for school trips\u000d\u000a      from across North West England and North Wales - more than half of its\u000d\u000a      visitors in 2011\/12 were school children. Further development of the\u000d\u000a      centre is coordinated by a joint Merseytravel\/LJMU development team, led\u000d\u000a      by LJMU astronomers. Spaceport, therefore, is a showcase for our ongoing\u000d\u000a      research into the universe that provides public engagement, education and\u000d\u000a      a stimulus for economic regeneration.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Spaceport is a Visitor Centre in an historic ferry terminal on the banks\u000d\u000a      of the Mersey which showcases astronomy and space exploration.

ARI developed and now operates the World's largest\u000d\u000a      fully robotic telescope - the Liverpool Telescope (LT) [Ref 1]\u000d\u000a      (leads - Bode: ARI Director, Steele: LT Director, Carter: LT Project\u000d\u000a      Scientist). The LT is a national astronomy facility of the UK, extensively\u000d\u000a      used through a number of international agreements by the wider\u000d\u000a      international community of astronomers.\u000d\u000a    One of the primary attributes of the telescope is its ability to react\u000d\u000a      very rapidly to unpredictable changes in astronomical objects. This has\u000d\u000a      enabled ARI researchers to develop a world lead in the study of a number\u000d\u000a      of transient astronomical phenomena. The most extreme are Gamma-Ray Bursts\u000d\u000a      (GRBs) - titanic explosions associated with the death throes of exotic\u000d\u000a      objects in distant galaxies [Ref 2]. The LT has also enabled the\u000d\u000a      ARI to lead in research into other transient phenomena such as Supernovae\u000d\u000a      and Novae [Ref 3]. Such dramatic events capture public interest\u000d\u000a      and feature strongly in events at Spaceport.\u000d\u000a    Linked to this work on transients is research into theoretical and\u000d\u000a      observational aspects of stellar evolution. ARI research encompasses the\u000d\u000a      environments in which stars are formed, their subsequent evolution, and\u000d\u000a      the evolution of star clusters and of galaxies [Ref 4]. This\u000d\u000a      research, therefore, covers all aspects of the \"life cycle\" of stars which\u000d\u000a      is a key component of the educational journey through the centre,\u000d\u000a      including specially designed exhibits that explore the evolution of\u000d\u000a      different types of star, and show how spectral information can be used to\u000d\u000a      understand stars.\u000d\u000a    Building upon this research background the ARI provides leadership of\u000d\u000a      major international projects investigating the nature and evolution of\u000d\u000a      galaxies in clusters [Ref 5], and in the field [Ref 6].\u000d\u000a      The tools for this are the most advanced international astronomical\u000d\u000a      facilities, telescopes both on the ground and in space, as well as the\u000d\u000a      in-house LT.\u000d\u000a    The Royal Astronomical Society's 2008 Group Award for outstanding\u000d\u000a      achievement was shared by two ARI staff members working on surveys of\u000d\u000a      galaxies. ARI continues to develop leads in new areas of activity, and ARI\u000d\u000a      staff are working actively on the next generation of surveys and the\u000d\u000a      instruments to carry them out.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18047","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    SENAR Precision Engineering Ltd (http:\/\/www.senar.co.uk\/)\u000d\u000a      is a long established (70 years) SME\u000d\u000a      on Merseyside, currently (July 2013) with 33 employees.

SENAR was identified\u000d\u000a      at that time as a\u000d\u000a      potential supplier to the project and through contracts with TTL built the\u000d\u000a      majority of the high value\u000d\u000a      precision mechanical components of the Liverpool Telescope in the period\u000d\u000a      2001-2004.\u000d\u000a    Ongoing Impact 2008-2013\u000d\u000a    This initial work for the Liverpool Telescope provides an ongoing impact\u000d\u000a      for SENAR, still featuring\u000d\u000a      in their advertising as an example of a high-profile\/high-technology\u000d\u000a      client. The reputation that\u000d\u000a      SENAR have developed as a result of this has taken them into new\u000d\u000a      international markets in\u000d\u000a      astronomy, particle physics and other advanced opto-mechanical systems.\u000d\u000a      This has led directly to\u000d\u000a      them being awarded contracts in the period 2008-2012 with other\u000d\u000a      international observatories (e.g.\u000d\u000a      work on the new William Herschel Telescope Auxiliary Camera) and CERN (for\u000d\u000a      whom they\u000d\u000a      produced the chain links that carry cooling pipes and electrical cables\u000d\u000a      for the LHC). SENAR are\u000d\u000a      now actively targeting work for STFC on the WEAVE multi-object\u000d\u000a      spectrograph and for ESO on the\u000d\u000a      E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).\u000d\u000a    As well as simple reputational impact from their engagement with the LT\u000d\u000a      project, however, we have\u000d\u000a      also made significant efforts to improve their capability. SENAR staff\u000d\u000a      frequently (most weeks) work\u000d\u000a      directly with ARI staff in the design and construction of enhanced\u000d\u000a      instrumentation for the Liverpool\u000d\u000a      Telescope such as the RINGO series of fast readout imaging polarimeters\u000d\u000a      (2008-2012) and the\u000d\u000a      IO:O (2009-2011) and IO:I (2012-2013) Infrared-Optical cameras. As part of\u000d\u000a      this, ARI have worked\u000d\u000a      with SENAR in developing their expertise in machining difficult-to-work\u000d\u000a      specialist materials such as\u000d\u000a      molybdenum and Invar.\u000d\u000a    A recent (2011) project with SENAR involved the design and manufacture of\u000d\u000a      a large (~1.2m\u000d\u000a      diameter) bearing location ring that had to be stiff yet lightweight. The\u000d\u000a      need for this component\u000d\u000a      arose from a requirement for higher image quality than was being delivered\u000d\u000a      by the LT which was\u000d\u000a      identified in the Robonet research programme to seek out exoplanets\u000d\u000a      through their gravitational\u000d\u000a      lensing effect on background stars (microlensing) [Ref 5]. LJMU is\u000d\u000a      a consortium member for this\u000d\u000a      programme. Because microlensing effects are rare events, the project\u000d\u000a      requires that very crowded\u000d\u000a      fields with large numbers of stars must be repeatedly searched for the\u000d\u000a      brief and unpronounced\u000d\u000a      brightening of background stars caused by the chance passage of a low-mass\u000d\u000a      exoplanet across\u000d\u000a      them. This in turn requires the best images. Research through pupil\u000d\u000a      imaging into the image\u000d\u000a      quality delivered by the LT identified a spherical aberration component\u000d\u000a      that could be corrected by\u000d\u000a      offsetting the telescope focal plane. This needed a large locating and\u000d\u000a      spacer ring to be inserted\u000d\u000a      into the telescope structure. ARI and SENAR staff collaborated on the\u000d\u000a      design of this, carrying out\u000d\u000a      Finite Element Analysis on proposed structures while still ensuring the\u000d\u000a      proposed designs were\u000d\u000a      actually feasible to manufacture. This activity allowed the company to\u000d\u000a      earn \"R&amp;D tax credits\"\u000d\u000a      (value &#163;48,000 in 2011\/12). This project also contributed to the success\u000d\u000a      of the company in winning\u000d\u000a      a grant of &#163;20,000 from the local council against a total capital spend of\u000d\u000a      &#163;80,000 to purchase a\u000d\u000a      new, large vertical milling machine. The need for specialist operators of\u000d\u000a      this equipment\u000d\u000a      subsequently directly created two new jobs in the company. In addition,\u000d\u000a      several other posts in the\u000d\u000a      company can be attributed to the work generated by the continuing\u000d\u000a      collaborative relationship\u000d\u000a      between SENAR and ARI. Overall, since 2008 turnover at SENAR has grown by\u000d\u000a      160% (from\u000d\u000a      &#163;980k in 2008 to &#163;2.6m in 2013) and they now employ 33 staff compared to\u000d\u000a      the 18 they employed\u000d\u000a      in 2008 (delivered against the background of a general engineering\u000d\u000a      recession in the UK) [Source\u000d\u000a        1].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    To survive and grow in a shrinking UK market, the local engineering\u000d\u000a      company SENAR set out to\u000d\u000a      transform itself from a local company into one capable of winning\u000d\u000a      international contracts.

Steele\u000d\u000a      and Carter joined the\u000d\u000a      group in 1997 not only to transform the scientific requirements derived\u000d\u000a      from the underpinning\u000d\u000a      research into an engineering specification but also to carry out new\u000d\u000a      research in novel control\u000d\u000a      architectures, scheduling algorithms and instrumentation for a robotic\u000d\u000a      telescope. The ERDF\u000d\u000a      funding led to the formation of a spin out company (Telescope Technologies\u000d\u000a      Ltd &#8212; TTL), which at\u000d\u000a      its peak employed over 50 highly skilled staff. ARI staff oversaw the\u000d\u000a      design of a telescope that\u000d\u000a      was scalable in the 2.0-4.0 meter class which incorporated specific\u000d\u000a      technologies that derived from\u000d\u000a      their research into optimising telescope performance and efficiency. These\u000d\u000a      included techniques\u000d\u000a      which achieved stabilised tracking with guaranteed performance (H-infinity\u000d\u000a      control), consistent\u000d\u000a      optical performance (active collimation), consistent operation\u000d\u000a      (self-healing computing), and efficient\u000d\u000a      execution of the highest priority observing programme (adaptive dispatch\u000d\u000a      scheduling with look-\u000d\u000a      ahead).\u000d\u000a    In parallel with work on telescope design, the ARI has also established a\u000d\u000a      research programme to\u000d\u000a      inspire instrumentation for robotic telescopes, focussing on identifying\u000d\u000a      science problems that can\u000d\u000a      be addressed with novel instrument concepts. As an example of this Mundell\u000d\u000a      (in 2002) and\u000d\u000a      Kobayashi (in 2005) joined the research group and subsequently developed a\u000d\u000a      leading programme\u000d\u000a      in GRB jet physics [Ref 3]. A key research insight obtained in\u000d\u000a      2006 was the strong diagnostic\u000d\u000a      power of optical polarization in understanding the magnetic field\u000d\u000a      configuration in the burst. This\u000d\u000a      then drove research by Steele into a new instrument concept (the RINGO\u000d\u000a      series of polarimeters)\u000d\u000a      that for the first time allowed the measurement of the polarization of a\u000d\u000a      rapidly fading object by\u000d\u000a      combining a rapidly rotating Polaroid with electron multiplying CCDs and\u000d\u000a      in-house designed fast-\u000d\u000a      trigger electronics [Refs 4, 6].\u000d\u000a    Capital Investment since project start in 1995 has been ~&#163;9,377,000\u000d\u000a      (&#163;6,950,000 from LJMU,\u000d\u000a      &#163;887,000 from UK Research Councils, &#163;340,000 from other universities and\u000d\u000a      &#163;1,200,000 from\u000d\u000a      EU\/ERDF).

The Zooniverse\u000d\u000a      includes 7 astronomy projects (the first being Galaxy Zoo,\u000d\u000a      launched 2009) and 9 projects beyond astronomy, for example in climate,\u000d\u000a      nature, health and the humanities. In November 2012 the users of Zooniverse\u000d\u000a      were surveyed to determine the nature, reach and significance of the\u000d\u000a      impacts. The survey received over 2000 responses [A], primarily from users\u000d\u000a      of astronomy projects Galaxy Zoo and Planet Hunters.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on the users of the Zooniverse: The\u000d\u000a      Zooniverse is distinguished by its broad reach, with more than\u000d\u000a      856,000 people engaging directly as a result of signing up to one or more\u000d\u000a      of the projects and taking part. Roughly one third of these volunteers are\u000d\u000a      from the UK, one third are from the US and one third are from over 100\u000d\u000a      other countries. Translations into languages including Polish, German and\u000d\u000a      Czech further widen the Zooniverse's reach. 85% of survey\u000d\u000a      respondents were not already amateur astronomers prior to engaging with Zooniverse.\u000d\u000a    88% of respondents agreed that the Zooniverse had increased their\u000d\u000a      understanding of how modern scientific research is carried out. In\u000d\u000a      addition to citing specific research methods they have learned about,\u000d\u000a      users say that working with real data has enhanced their understanding of\u000d\u000a      the research process. Comments include: \"working with real data [...]\u000d\u000a        gives me a better feel for the connection between data scientists deal\u000d\u000a        with and the conclusions they develop from it\" and \"by\u000d\u000a        participating in the research, I have appreciated more what researchers\u000d\u000a        have to check for, cross referencing their data, and analysing the\u000d\u000a        results\". Comments also indicate a better understanding of\u000d\u000a      scientific consensus: \"a thing isn't true just because one person says\u000d\u000a        or believes it is, a thing is true because it can be shown to be by\u000d\u000a        observations and measurements which are not dependent upon one's\u000d\u000a        personal bias and\/or belief structure.\"\u000d\u000a    85% agreed that the Zooniverse had increased their understanding\u000d\u000a      of astronomy and physics. Again users list specific scientific concepts\u000d\u000a      they now understand, for example gravitational lensing and morphological\u000d\u000a      classification of galaxies. Comments include: \"with every Zooniverse\u000d\u000a        project I've participated in my knowledge of that subject has increased\u000d\u000a        substantially.\" 78% of under-18s said they were more encouraged to\u000d\u000a      study physics or astronomy at a higher level as a result of the Zooniverse.\u000d\u000a      39% of all respondents said they were more likely to take up a scientific\u000d\u000a      career as a consequence of their experiences with the Zooniverse.\u000d\u000a    Over half of respondents have changed their astronomical observing\u000d\u000a      behaviour as a result of the Zooniverse including 19% who observed the\u000d\u000a      night sky for the first time. Many note that they have bought their own\u000d\u000a      telescopes and now observe as a family activity. In all, 87% of\u000d\u000a      respondents reported at least one increase in engagement with science as a\u000d\u000a      result of the Zooniverse, including those who read more about\u000d\u000a      science (68%), studied more formally (34%), carried out their own research\u000d\u000a      (12%), attended lectures or events (19%), and\/or visited museums and\u000d\u000a      planetariums (33%).\u000d\u000a    The highly accessible nature of the Zooniverse is an important\u000d\u000a      factor in enabling these impacts. Users comment that \"these projects\u000d\u000a        have allowed me to feel less removed from the daily application of\u000d\u000a        science and more knowledgeable about astronomy, something I've always\u000d\u000a        had an interest in but have been too intimidated to pursue seriously\"\u000d\u000a      and \"what was once seemed [sic] distant, lofty, and inaccessible to\u000d\u000a        many people is now right at their fingertips.\"\u000d\u000a    Teaching: Further reach is achieved through formal and informal\u000d\u000a      teaching. Teachers use the Zooniverse site directly to support\u000d\u000a      classroom learning and comments suggest that this \"has opened their\u000d\u000a        curiosity in a whole new way\" and changed some students'\u000d\u000a      preconception that \"science was hard or boring.\" Another teacher\u000d\u000a      comments that \"the feedback from students suggests that they learn\u000d\u000a        about physics\/astronomy but also get a better understanding of what\u000d\u000a        scientists actually do.\" In recognition that impact through teachers\u000d\u000a      is an important pathway, the Zooniverse has produced resources for\u000d\u000a      teachers directly. A series of workshops, using Galaxy Zoo data,\u000d\u000a      were organised in Oxford and following their success the Zooteach\u000d\u000a      tools were launched in 2011. These resources include 38 lesson-plans\u000d\u000a      categorised by subject and age, and have received almost 14,000 page views\u000d\u000a      between 1st January 2013 and 30th July 2013.\u000d\u000a    Many survey respondents note that they participate in Zooniverse\u000d\u000a      projects with their families in an informal learning environment. A user\u000d\u000a      said \"the combination of tutorials and extensive community discussion\u000d\u000a        about the data are an invaluable part of increasing mine and my family's\u000d\u000a        scientific literacy.\" 47% of under-18s said that the Zooniverse\u000d\u000a      had helped with their school work. Parents find the Zooniverse\u000d\u000a      beneficial to support their children; for example one commented that \"I\u000a        have a better understanding of physics, so much so I can help my son in\u000d\u000a        his school work.\"\u000d\u000a    Media: Many of the Zooniverse projects have enjoyed a high\u000d\u000a      media profile, both on launch and during their operation. UK broadcast\u000d\u000a      examples included BBC Radio 4's Today Programme (6 appearances) and PM (1\u000d\u000a      appearance), BBC Breakfast (1 appearance), Bang Goes the Theory (2\u000d\u000a      appearances). Lintott is co-presenter of Sky at Night (viewership 1\u000d\u000a      million) where Galaxy Zoo was featured and other projects\u000d\u000a      mentioned. Stargazing Live (viewership 4 million) also featured two\u000d\u000a      projects on episodes of the show. Galaxy Zoo was reviewed in the Guardian\u000d\u000a      [B] which concluded that there was \"no surer way to engage the public\u000d\u000a        than to involve people in the research itself.\" Planet Hunters is\u000d\u000a      showcased in the Economist [C].\u000d\u000a    Museums: Museums have also made use of the underlying Zooniverse\u000d\u000a      software leading to a wider audience than just the primary users of the\u000d\u000a      online projects. Zooniverse project Solar Stormwatch has\u000d\u000a      been at the heart of programmes for schools and visitors run by the Royal\u000d\u000a      Observatory Greenwich. This won `Best Innovative Site' at the 2010\u000d\u000a      `Museums and the Web' awards [D]. The Public Astronomer at the Royal\u000d\u000a      Observatory Greenwich said, Solar Stormwatch has \"certainly\u000d\u000a        had a very positive impact on the content of our public programme, as\u000d\u000a        well as the Observatory's online and media profile. We regularly run\u000d\u000a        solar viewing sessions [...] and Solar Stormwatch has been the\u000d\u000a        springboard for several of these\" [E]. US museums, including the\u000d\u000a      Adler Planetarium in Chicago (500,000 visitors per year), have also\u000d\u000a      featured Zooniverse projects prominently in floor displays and in\u000d\u000a      public programs. The President of the Adler Planetarium said: \"Our\u000d\u000a        partnership with Oxford University on the Zooniverse citizen science\u000d\u000a        effort is a critical component of our success in inspiring the next\u000d\u000a        generation of explorer. The Zooniverse permeates our operation, and\u000d\u000a        allows us to offer all visitors meaningful opportunities to engage in\u000d\u000a        frontier science\" [F].\u000d\u000a    Charity: Cell Slider, a Zooniverse project\u000d\u000a      launched in 2012 in collaboration with Cancer Research UK (CRUK), is the\u000d\u000a      first biomedical citizen science project in the world; its purpose is to\u000d\u000a      accelerate cures for cancers by using citizen scientists to classify\u000d\u000a      tumour samples. So far Cell Slider has helped to reduce analysis\u000d\u000a      time from 18 months to three months, and with accuracy that shows a high\u000d\u000a      degree of agreement with expert pathologists. The Citizen Science Lead at\u000d\u000a      CRUK said, \"in addition to significantly reducing research timeframes,\u000d\u000a        CRUK recognise Zooniverse's impacts on their work as a charity. The\u000d\u000a        Zooniverse has given us access to a community of people outside of the\u000d\u000a        typical CRUK supporter base. Cell Slider is the first non-fundraising\u000d\u000a        product CRUK have launched and the first time that CRUK cancer research\u000d\u000a        data has been made publicly available for analysis. The Zooniverse has\u000d\u000a        made an essential contribution to these developments.\" [G]\u000d\u000a    Sustainability: There are many problems in science that cannot be\u000d\u000a      dealt with by purely automated processes, and capability to crowdsource\u000d\u000a      parts of the analysis is crucial. By pursuing these scientific problems\u000d\u000a      through citizen science, the Zooniverse has created a virtuous\u000d\u000a      circle where the scientific outcomes and the public both benefit. In only\u000d\u000a      four years, this stream of citizen science has grown into a large activity\u000d\u000a      measured by number of users and the diversity of projects: from January\u000d\u000a      2013 to July 2013, between 500 and 1000 new users signed up daily and 4\u000d\u000a      new Zooniverse projects were launched. On-going engagement is\u000d\u000a      apparent through the Zooteach resources, discussion forums and\u000d\u000a      special tools for advanced users.\u000d\u000a    Recognition: In 2011, Lintott won the Royal Society Kohn Award \"for\u000a        his excellent engagement with society in matters of science and its\u000d\u000a        social dimension\". Zooniverse also won the President's Prize\u000d\u000a      in the Institute of Physics web awards. Zooniverse was the\u000d\u000a      People's Choice winner as well as the overall winner by the judges, who\u000d\u000a      described it as \"a great site for non-professionals to take part in\u000d\u000a        serious scientific discovery\" (Paul Millar); \"an engaging online\u000d\u000a        experience that takes visitors beyond browsing and into genuine\u000d\u000a        interaction\" (Sumit Paul-Choudhury); and \"a great way to harness\u000d\u000a        collaboration, sense of participating and making a difference\"\u000d\u000a      (Maggie Philbin). The Old Weather project, a collaboration with\u000d\u000a      the Met Office, won the 2012 Royal Meteorological Society award for\u000d\u000a      \"Meteorological innovation that matters\" &#8212; the certificate states that the\u000d\u000a      success of Old Weather \"depended on the efforts of the Zooniverse\u000d\u000a        team, who built the novel website interface which ultimately allowed the\u000d\u000a        public to digitize the data with minimum effort\" [H].\u000d\u000a    Commercial uptake: In 2009, Microsoft licensed the Zooniverse\u000d\u000a      framework in their development for NASA of Be A Martian. Tiny Planets,\u000d\u000a      an educational website, also implemented a version of the Zooniverse\u000d\u000a      project Moon Zoo adapted for children aged 4-7, into their online\u000d\u000a      educational virtual world. Scribe, a generic package for\u000d\u000a      crowdsourced transcription, was developed by the Oxford team as\u000d\u000a      open-source software. The first third-party implementation of Scribe\u000d\u000a      was in What's the Score, a partnership between the Bodleian\u000d\u000a      Library and Google to digitize a collection of music manuscripts.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Zooniverse citizen science projects, including Galaxy\u000d\u000a        Zoo, have engaged over 856,000 members of the public from 100\u000d\u000a      countries with astronomy and other areas of research such as nature,\u000d\u000a      health and the humanities. The impacts include increased public awareness\u000d\u000a      and understanding of science and research methods, changes in the\u000d\u000a      attitudes of school children and adults, and benefits to teaching and\u000d\u000a      learning.

Ground and space-based platforms such as the Sloan Digital Sky\u000d\u000a      Survey and the Hubble Space Telescope have produced large numbers\u000d\u000a      (typically millions) of images featuring galaxies and other astronomical\u000d\u000a      objects of interest. Previous work [1] had demonstrated that such samples\u000d\u000a      were best assembled through visual inspection, a PhD student at Oxford,\u000d\u000a      Kevin Schawinski, having classified 50,000 galaxies by eye. To find a\u000d\u000a      sustainable solution, the Oxford team developed software that could be\u000d\u000a      scaled to handle the size of modern datasets to crowdsource the problem.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, using the newly developed software, Lintott demonstrated that it\u000d\u000a      was possible to train members of the public to classify galaxies with\u000d\u000a      sufficient accuracy that, when cross-referenced with each other, the data\u000d\u000a      could be used in scientific research [2]. Gathering several independent\u000d\u000a      classifications for each galaxy, and quantitative estimates of error in\u000d\u000a      the classification, was critical to the system. Using the public as a\u000d\u000a      resource for classification meant that vast data sets could be analysed.\u000d\u000a      The public online interface with the classification software was named Galaxy\u000a        Zoo and within its first year of operation was able to collect 50\u000d\u000a      million classifications. With multiple classifications used for each\u000d\u000a      galaxy, this resulted in the first data release of morphological\u000d\u000a      classifications for nearly 900,000 galaxies [3]. Galaxy Zoo is a\u000d\u000a      collaboration between Oxford, Portsmouth and Nottingham universities.\u000d\u000a      Portsmouth and Nottingham each provided science team members who assisted\u000d\u000a      with the analysis of Galaxy Zoo data. The scientific direction,\u000d\u000a      project development, and operation were led by Oxford.\u000d\u000a    Having demonstrated the effectiveness of this form of citizen science,\u000d\u000a      the Oxford team developed the Zooniverse platform capable of\u000d\u000a      supporting the widest possible range of projects. This new platform was\u000d\u000a      first used to re-launch Galaxy Zoo and now supports 17 live\u000d\u000a      projects in a range of subject areas, collectively known as the Zooniverse.\u000d\u000a      In 2009, Lintott was appointed to a permanent position in the department.\u000d\u000a    The power of this platform, coupled with scientific insights into the\u000d\u000a      kinds of problems that could be tackled, has enabled some remarkable\u000d\u000a      discoveries in astrophysics that would not have been possible without\u000d\u000a      effective analysis of large data sets. These include the discovery of a\u000d\u000a      quasar-scale light-echo [4], the first planet in a four star system [5]\u000d\u000a      and a sophisticated measurement of the dust distribution in the Earth's\u000d\u000a      orbit [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18318","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    (citations e.g. [A] are to corroborative sources in section 5)\u000d\u000a    The impact arises through an outreach programme delivered by Professor\u000d\u000a      Brian Foster that\u000d\u000a      portrays the development and achievements of modern particle physics with\u000d\u000a      illustration through\u000d\u000a      music. The format was first developed in 2005 by Foster with the virtuoso\u000d\u000a      violinist Jack Liebeck\u000d\u000a      (Professor at the Royal Academy of Music and Classical Brit Award winner\u000d\u000a      in 2010) and discusses\u000d\u000a      the quest to unify the laws of physics as Einstein tried, inevitably\u000d\u000a      unsuccessfully, to do. Since\u000d\u000a      Einstein loved the violin and played it all his life, Foster and Liebeck\u000d\u000a      use the violin to illustrate the\u000d\u000a      concepts of modern particle physics and introduce an additional dimension\u000d\u000a      to a science lecture. By\u000d\u000a      appealing to music lovers who might otherwise never attend a science\u000d\u000a      event, they also attract a\u000d\u000a      new audience to hear about physics.\u000d\u000a    The content of the two shows in this programme concentrates on the\u000d\u000a      answers that accelerators\u000d\u000a      and experimental particle physics are providing to the big questions of\u000d\u000a      why the Universe exists,\u000d\u000a      what are the laws that govern it and why it has evolved as it has. The\u000d\u000a      outreach is thus directly\u000d\u000a      underpinned by research by members of the department: instrumentation and\u000d\u000a      accelerator\u000d\u000a      development and experimental work ensure that the most exciting and\u000d\u000a      topical areas of LHC\u000d\u000a      analysis are communicated, while the theoretical work on many aspects of\u000d\u000a      these phenomena\u000d\u000a      develops the wider context and provides continuity from Einstein's work on\u000d\u000a      unification of the forces.\u000d\u000a      The first show, \"Superstrings\", illustrates Einstein's development of\u000d\u000a      General Relativity, discusses\u000d\u000a      why he failed to unify the laws of physics and describes how superstring\u000d\u000a      theory could succeed\u000d\u000a      where Einstein failed. The second, \"Einstein's Universe\", discusses\u000d\u000a      Einstein's contribution to\u000d\u000a      quantum theory and the development of accelerators that led to the LHC.\u000d\u000a      Both shows describe the\u000d\u000a      construction of the LHC and its detectors, concentrating on the ATLAS\u000d\u000a      Semiconductor Tracker\u000d\u000a      built at Oxford and showing the magnitude and complexity of the assembly\u000d\u000a      of ATLAS. They\u000d\u000a      conclude with the latest LHC results, including work in which Oxford has\u000d\u000a      played a crucial role [7].\u000d\u000a      They are interspersed with music that Einstein loved, played by Liebeck;\u000d\u000a      finally Foster and Liebeck\u000d\u000a      play a Mozart duet. The violin is used to illustrate key concepts in the\u000d\u000a      lectures such as the\u000d\u000a      relationship between wavelength and resolution and the vibrational modes\u000d\u000a      of strings; Liebeck not\u000d\u000a      only plays the violin but has an important role in helping Foster explain\u000d\u000a      the science. Some events\u000d\u000a      in larger venues are followed by a concert featuring music that Einstein\u000d\u000a      particularly enjoyed. The\u000d\u000a      conception and delivery of the \"Einstein's Universe\" event were supported\u000d\u000a      by an STFC Large\u000d\u000a      Award (Science in Society scheme) of &#163;92,521.\u000d\u000a    Reach\u000d\u000a    A total audience exceeding 17,000 attended either Einstein's Universe (90\u000d\u000a      performances) or\u000d\u000a      Superstrings (26 performances) between January 2008 and July 2013\u000d\u000a      (inclusive).

A tour\u000d\u000a      in New Zealand in July 2013 performed at 10 venues to a total audience of\u000d\u000a      2,350. Elizabeth Kerr, a\u000d\u000a      former Chief Executive of New Zealand's Arts Council, reviewed `Einstein's\u000d\u000a      Universe' on Radio NZ\u000d\u000a      Concert (a predominantly classical music channel) as succeeding in getting\u000d\u000a      \"the music people to\u000d\u000a        the science\" [B].

One teacher, a winner of an IoP Teacher of Physics award in\u000d\u000a      2012, wrote,\u000d\u000a    \"There is no doubt that lectures such as yours (and yours was one of\u000d\u000a        the very\u000d\u000a        best) raise the profile of the subject and can sow the seeds for\u000d\u000a        youngsters to\u000d\u000a        want to go on to further study in that field.\" [F].\u000d\u000a    As part of such programmes, teachers report that they consider the\u000d\u000a      lectures to have played a\u000d\u000a      significant part in increasing the numbers of students taking Physics at\u000d\u000a      A-level and generating a\u000d\u000a      more positive attitude to science with greater engagement in lessons\u000d\u000a      [F,G].\u000d\u000a    Influence on future study and career choices: Foster has\u000d\u000a      received letters and emails saying\u000d\u000a      that the lecture has inspired the writers to study physics further, and\u000d\u000a      these are echoed by teachers\u000d\u000a      who consider that the events have inspired students to study physics at\u000d\u000a      university, including by\u000d\u000a      going beyond the school curriculum. A Year 10 pupil wrote in 2010, \"After\u000d\u000a        attending your lecture I\u000d\u000a        understood much that I didn't before...

A prototype smartphone application, \"LHSee\", was created by Barr\u000a      and Boddy with support from a STFC small award (ST\/I507069\/1). The app\u000a      shows users real collision events from ATLAS, rendered in 3D, necessarily\u000a      simplified for clarity and bandwidth. Just as in the tools used within\u000a      ATLAS, the detector elements can be shown, as can 2D projections. With the\u000a      guidance provided, the user can learn to use these displays to interpret\u000a      the events using logic analogous to the processes used in the ATLAS\u000a      collaboration. The technical implementation and educational potential was\u000a      presented in Physics Education [A].\u000a    \u000a    A collision event in the ATLAS experiment rendered with LHSee.\u000a    \u000a    The app was launched through Android Marketplace, now Google Play, on 7th\u000a      October 2011, and is described there as \"LHSee makes the\u000a        Hadron Collider accessible to anybody with an Android smartphone or\u000a        tablet PC. ... For the first time you can now grab live collision events\u000a        from the underground detectors in Geneva, and beam them direct to your\u000a        own device.\" [B]. By including some test data, it also allowed users\u000a      to \"Hunt the Higgs\", and thus gain a conception of what `discovery'\u000a      entails. Concurrent with the CERN press conference in July 2012 on the\u000a      discovery of the new particle, real data from observed candidate Higgs\u000a      events was made available in LHSee. This was given publicity by CERN and\u000a      resulted in several thousand new downloads.\u000a    Development of this app required (i) the reduction of each large event\u000a      dataset to something that is feasible to transmit to a smartphone and (ii)\u000a      the trust of the ATLAS collaboration to access live events without\u000a      conveying meaningful numerical data. Neither would have been possible\u000a      without a detailed knowledge of the ATLAS detectors, an understanding of\u000a      the physics that could be appreciated from a simplified rendering of the\u000a      event, and a respected role in the collaboration. Barr, Hays and Boddy's\u000a      research, and the wider context of the Oxford ATLAS group, thus directly\u000a      underpins both the conception and implementation of this app.\u000a    Barr's roles on this project were as application content advisor, project\u000a      manager, and liaison with CERN, ATLAS and STFC. Boddy was the lead content\u000a      and software developer. They were advised by a wide range of other\u000a      experts, including commercial smartphone application developers, the ATLAS\u000a      outreach group, the ATLAS UK collaboration, the STFC media team, the CERN\u000a      press office, and &#8212; at the time of release &#8212; various contacts in the\u000a      popular press.

The app\u000a      incorporates a feedback form, from which analysis of a set of 1000\u000a      responses indicated a wide user age range: 10% were aged 18 or under; 45%\u000a      19-35, 20% 36-50 and 11% 51 or over [C].

From these sources, benefits to users\u000a      fall into three principal categories:\u000a    Raising interest and inspiration: User comments include \"Glorious\u000a        beyond words\" [B], `LHSee is an excellent effort to make us feel\u000a        a part of grand discovery' and `its like being able to reach out\u000a        and lay a hand on the pulse of super science' [C]. Many users were\u000a      sufficiently engaged to suggest extra features they would like to see,\u000a      some of which have since been implemented.\u000a    Understanding the experiment: Free-text responses included some\u000a      confirmation that users had used the app to gain a better understanding of\u000a      how events are analysed: `I almost felt like I was working beside the\u000a        physicists while analysing those real-time events'; `Quite complicated,\u000a        but I understand the basics now'; `It only took me a few tries to be\u000a        able to discern the types of events described' and `Thank you for\u000a        helping us visualize what the LHC is.' [C]\u000a    Encouragement to study further: 73% of those aged 18 or under in\u000a      the feedback forms analysed agreed or strongly agreed that the app\u000a      `encouraged them to study physics at a higher level' [C]. Free-text\u000a      responses included `It has rekindled an interest in science and\u000a        mathematics. I do intend on studying the subject now' and `Wish\u000a        [I] was part of the team. Wish I could continue my higher education in\u000a        particle physics.' [C]\u000a    Press and media coverage\u000a      LHSee has been featured in a number of publications and websites,\u000a      including positive reviews in The Times [F], the Daily Mail\u000a      [G], a Guardian blog, Forbes [H] and other international\u000a      media. It has also been flagged specifically for its educational value\u000a      e.g. [D,I]. A detailed review on the AndroidTapp website noted, \"you\u000a        really have to apply and learn how things work to get the most out of\u000a        the app\" and \"given a little time, you can really begin to\u000a        understand how important the work is that they are doing\" [I]. The\u000a      Gizmodo site awarded it `App of the Day', commenting, \"The LHC is .. a\u000a        very important part of human history and... I know so very little about\u000a        it. This app presents the LHC's mission and various experiments in a\u000a        much more digestible package.\" [J].\u000a    Sustainability and third-party support\u000a      The version described here was limited to a single application, containing\u000a      only a few key `demonstrator' features and available only to users with\u000a      Android devices. To ensure engagement can be widened further and to\u000a      support greater understanding of the Higgs discovery, a follow-on STFC\u000a      Large Award was secured in April 2012 (ST\/K000462\/1, &#163;43k). This funded\u000a      development of a subsequent version, `Collider', including creation of a\u000a      version for iPhone\/iPad, and extension to a wider range of educational and\u000a      outreach application resources.

More\u000a      widely, Oxford Physics played crucial roles in the development and\u000a      construction of the ATLAS detector, in particular the semiconductor\u000a      tracker in the inner detector, and has since been vigorously involved in\u000a      physics analysis as well as software development, operations and\u000a      maintenance. In July 2013, the ATLAS group at Oxford comprised 11 academic\u000a      staff, 4 PDRAs and 15 doctoral students.\u000a    One member of the Oxford group, Dr Alan Barr, was convenor of one of the\u000a      ATLAS SUSY subgroups (missing-ET), responsible\u000a      for defining, managing and editing the first SUSY search analyses\u000a      (2010-2011). The highly sensitive and robust search strategies he proposed\u000a      [1] were adopted in the early data analyses. A necessary prerequisite for\u000a      discovery is the understanding of Standard Model backgrounds, for which\u000a      Barr proposed and performed background measurements (multijet, boson+jet\u000a      and detector-resolution) for five SUSY search publications [e.g. 2,4,5].\u000a      Of these, three were edited by Barr and one of the Oxford research\u000a      students. These searches extended the sensitivity for first-generation\u000a      squarks and gluinos up to the TeV scale, and include one of the most\u000a      highly cited ATLAS publications. Amongst them is a particularly innovative\u000a      method for searching for SUSY in complex events where particles decay to\u000a      six or more jets [5].\u000a    These papers all include a description of the ATLAS detector, the object\u000a      (particle track) reconstruction, and the subsequent selection of events\u000a      specific to each analysis. A comprehensive understanding of the components\u000a      of the detector, and the process by which events are deduced from the raw\u000a      data it collects, are thus critical to all analysis of ATLAS experiments.\u000a      In order to examine individual reconstructed events and the underlying\u000a      data, the global ATLAS collaboration uses the ATLANTIS and VP1\u000a      visualisation codes (both written elsewhere) to render detector signals\u000a      and event reconstructions in 2D and 3D respectively. Although powerful,\u000a      VP1 is available only within other software, is restricted to the ATLAS\u000a      collaboration and is of considerable size and complexity. The impact\u000a      reported here arose through software that is the only 3D event display\u000a      outwith the ATLAS collaboration and of considerably smaller size than VP1.\u000a    Dr Alan Barr joined Oxford as a University Lecturer in particle physics\u000a      in 2007. He was Physics (analysis) coordinator of the ATLAS UK\u000a      collaboration from 2008-2011. He has also been a trained data acquisition\u000a      shift expert for ATLAS. Mr Chris Boddy was a STFC-funded doctoral student\u000a      at the University of Oxford (2008-12), supervised by Dr Chris Hays, a\u000a      lecturer in the Department since 2007. Boddy's thesis topic was the search\u000a      for Higgs boson(s) with ATLAS.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18322","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a      [A], [B] etc are references to corroborating sources listed in\u000a          section 5.\u000a      Public engagement in accelerator science\u000a        Accelerate! is an outreach show that has been delivered in the UK\u000a        and Germany to over 7,700\u000a        schoolchildren, in most cases aged 11-18. The ideas were developed by\u000a        Sheehy and Foster with\u000a        advice from Emmanuel Tsesmelis (CERN and Visiting Professor at Oxford)\u000a        and supported by an\u000a        STFC Small Award for &#163;7,898 (ST\/G502047\/1, 2008-10). Its aim is to\u000a        engage children in the\u000a        excitement of accelerator science, and to build on the public interest\u000a        in the LHC to explain more\u000a        everyday applications.\u000a      The show is structured around the principal elements of a particle\u000a        accelerator: particles, energy,\u000a        control, collision and detection. The show also emphasises that the\u000a        minority of accelerators are\u000a        designed for particle physics (e.g. the Large Hadron Collider and\u000a        International Linear Collider)\u000a        while the majority are for medicine, industry or research in other\u000a        disciplines (e.g. Diamond). It thus\u000a        not only relies on a fundamental understanding of challenges in\u000a        accelerator science, but also\u000a        draws on current projects in the JAI for both existing and future\u000a        accelerators across a range of\u000a        potential applications. For example, a real prototype of a 30 GHz RF\u000a        cavity from the Compact\u000a        Linear Collider project based at CERN is shown to illustrate continuing\u000a        development in the field.\u000a      The show gives demonstrations that provide specific insights into\u000a        accelerator science. For\u000a        example, an interactive map of accelerators in UK (excluding industry)\u000a        is used to locate the accelerator\u000a        nearest to the venue, which is often found to be in a hospital; and a\u000a        `Mexican wave' transporting beach\u000a        balls through audience participation (original to this project)\u000a        illustrates the acceleration of charged\u000a        particles by a radiofrequency wave.\u000a      Primary audiences: attendees and benefits received\u000a        The first performances of Accelerate! were in December 2008. So\u000a        far it has been performed by\u000a        teams from Oxford Physics 76 times, in schools and elsewhere around the\u000a        UK, to a total of over\u000a        5300 students, 280 teachers and 995 members of the public [A].\u000a        This includes sixteen\u000a        performances at the British Science Festival in September 2010 to over\u000a        1000 students aged 11-14.\u000a        Respondents to surveys held in some of the early shows (from 487\u000a        feedback forms from\u000a        schoolchildren), agreed or strongly agreed with the following opinions [A]:\u000a      \u000a        78% `understood the science'\u000a        91% thought `the presenters did a good job'\u000a        43% were `interested in physics' and 33% `not interested' before\u000a          they saw the show\u000a        62% were `more interested in physics now they've seen the show' and\u000a          only 7.6% not\u000a      \u000a      Wider uptake and sustainability\u000a        From the beginning, Accelerate! was designed to be presented\u000a        predominantly by graduate student\u000a        volunteers who pass on their expertise to more junior colleagues,\u000a        thereby ensuring the\u000a        continuation of the project and that the age difference to the audience\u000a        is minimised. In 2012,\u000a        Andrew Steele, also an Oxford Physics graduate student, developed some\u000a        resources and training\u000a        for new participants outside Oxford, supported by an award of &#163;9,629\u000a        from STFC (ST\/J501827\/1)\u000a        and &#163;10,000 (including in-kind support) from the South East Physics\u000a        Network, SEPnet. As a\u000a        result, a `toolkit' to allow others to put on their own versions was\u000a        made available online, under a\u000a        Creative Commons licence.\u000a      One of the demonstrations used in the show is a simple cloud chamber,\u000a        adapted from a teachers'\u000a        workshop at CERN. To enable others to include this in their own\u000a        presentations, Sheehy and\u000a        Steele made a video of its construction and demonstration that has had\u000a        over 25,000 views on\u000a        YouTube [B]. A podcast of an entire performance in\u000a        Oxford has been downloaded approximately\u000a        200 times since February 2012.\u000a      The SEPnet group of universities now delivers Accelerate! under\u000a        licence [C] and by February 2013\u000a        they had given 20 additional shows to over 1880 attendees. Foster\u000a        founded a team at the DESY\u000a        laboratory in Hamburg, Germany, to adapt the concepts of Accelerate!\u000a        for their own show in\u000a        German, known as Rennmaschinen [D], which\u000a        attracted 560 children and 166 adults over its first\u000a        seven performances (April 2012 - June 2013).\u000a      Benefits to teachers\u000a        Accelerate! has been performed specifically for teachers twice at\u000a        a conference in York and once in\u000a        Oxford, with a total audience of 130. Of the 103 survey responses\u000a        received, 92 indicated they\u000a        would recommend the show to other teachers and 87 considered it to be a\u000a        good way to help\u000a        students understand concepts in physics.\u000a      A training session for teachers by Sheehy, drawing on experience and\u000a        demonstrations from\u000a        Accelerate!, formed part of the annual Accelerator and Particle\u000a        Physics Education at A-Level\u000a        (APPEAL) one-day course in Oxford (2010-2013) in collaboration with\u000a        CERN. Approximately 20\u000a        teachers attended each year. Comments received from participants in 2010\u000a        included,\u000a        \"You have all inspired me to do some background reading and learn a\u000a          little more.\"\u000a        \"I have been inspired to try to increase the prestige and attainment in\u000a        Physics in my\u000a        school through a trip to CERN.\"\u000a      The 16 teachers who responded to online evaluation surveys in 2010 and\u000a        2012 considered they\u000a        had gained a better understanding of particle physics and accelerators\u000a        and that it would help their\u000a        teaching at AS\/A level [E]. Eleven teachers from 2010\u000a        and 2011 responded to a follow-up\u000a        questionnaire in 2012: all reported that it had informed their teaching\u000a        `a great deal' or `quite a lot',\u000a        identifying `up to date information' as one of the most useful aspects,\u000a        and all but one had\u000a        undertaken some other follow-up activity [E]. The\u000a        APPEAL course is now well established:\u000a        APPEAL-4 was delivered in June 2013 and included a presentation by\u000a        Sheehy on applications of\u000a        particle accelerators. Sheehy's session was also incorporated in CERN's\u000a        High School Teachers\u000a        programme in 2010 (60 participants) [F].\u000a      External recognition and invitations\u000a        The John Adams Institute led a team, with a number of collaborative\u000a        partners and sponsors, that\u000a        successfully proposed and developed an exhibit for the prestigious Royal\u000a        Society Summer Science\u000a        Exhibition in 2009 [G]. This exhibit, `Accelerators\u000a          Everywhere: From the Big Bang to curing cancer',\u000a        emphasised the practical applications of accelerators and included\u000a        hands-on activities informed by\u000a        the experiences of Accelerate!. The exhibition as a whole was\u000a        visited by over 4000 members of\u000a        the public [H].\u000a      At the 2010 British Science Festival, Sheehy gave the 2010 Lord Kelvin\u000a        Physical Sciences Award\u000a        Lecture discussing the funding of international accelerator experiments\u000a        and wrote a guest blog\u000a        describing the Accelerate! show. Andrew Steele was invited to\u000a        co-present for an episode of the\u000a        `How Do' series on ITV Meridian in 2010, answering the question \"How do\u000a        you make science fun?\"\u000a        using a number of Accelerate! demonstrations. The four annual\u000a        finalists for the Institute of Physics'\u000a        Very Early Career Physics Communicators Award have included both Sheehy\u000a        in 2011 [I] and\u000a        Steele in 2012.\u000a      Coverage on BBC Radio Oxford has widened the reach further. An\u000a        interview about Accelerate! at\u000a        the Cooper School, Bicester, for the Oxford Science Roadshow, was\u000a        featured on `Daytime with\u000a        Danny and Lou' on 11th March 2009.

For example, the constraints of\u000a        medical applications have\u000a        guided new accelerator designs; the stability and performance required\u000a        for practical synchrotron\u000a        light sources have motivated better monitoring and control [4,5]; and particle detectors first\u000a        developed for the ILC have been adapted for spatial imaging in mass\u000a        spectrometry by Dr Andrei\u000a        Nomerotski (Lecturer in Oxford 2005-12). The awareness of these\u000a        requirements and the\u000a        capabilities that accelerators can offer have thus been an integral part\u000a        of this research.\u000a      "},{"CaseStudyId":"18939","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Cassini Scientist for a Day competition and our Media Space summer\u000d\u000a      schools have increased the interest, knowledge and learning skills of more\u000d\u000a      than 300 secondary school pupils from around the UK.

Average viewing\u000d\u000a      times are in excess of 3 minutes, demonstrating significant engagement\u000d\u000a      with the material.

Last year alone we had 32 students inspired to do\u000d\u000a        research about Saturn and Cassini. Academic impact of this competition\u000d\u000a        should not be underestimated. Doing research for the essays helped our\u000d\u000a        students to gain valuable experience and to improve their independent\u000d\u000a        learning skills. The competition has enriched our teaching curriculum\u000d\u000a        across the year groups\" [1]. We conducted a survey of teachers whose\u000d\u000a      schools participated in the competition, and 100% of responses said they\u000d\u000a      would encourage their students to participate again. Selected comments\u000d\u000a      received from the respondents describing the impact on the pupils who\u000d\u000a      participated include: \"Many of them did gain new knowledge of Saturn\u000d\u000a        and the mission.

It began as a\u000d\u000a      partnership with Morpeth school and expanded to include St. Paul's Way and\u000d\u000a      Stepney Green Schools. The annual programme consisted of a five-day summer\u000d\u000a      school, attended by 20 students, comprising workshops run by academics and\u000d\u000a      media professionals, allowing students to explore astronomy research and\u000d\u000a      science communication. A key element was the one-day Cassini Science\u000d\u000a      Planning workshops. Students attended talks about Cassini research\u000d\u000a      [R1-R4], and were divided into four \"research groups\" each with an AU\u000d\u000a      mentor, studying Atmospheres, Rings, Surfaces, and\u000d\u000a      Fields and Particles. They were provided with a model of the\u000d\u000a      Cassini spacecraft incorporating a camera, a dust detector, a magnetometer\u000d\u000a      and radar, and a segment of the Cassini tour. The spacecraft must rotate\u000d\u000a      for different instruments to take data and downlinks require time\u000d\u000a      segments. Each group was tasked to design an observation sequence using\u000d\u000a      all instruments, maximizing the scientific gain for their particular\u000d\u000a      research topic. The final task involved merging the separate sequences\u000d\u000a      into a single optimal sequence through a process of scientific argument\u000d\u000a      and debate. This mimics how Cassini observations are scheduled, and hones\u000d\u000a      the students' abilities to formulate and debate scientific arguments. The\u000d\u000a      students generated films and magazines relating to space exploration\u000d\u000a      during the Media Space programmes that are available on our public\u000d\u000a      outreach webpage [4]. Over 10,000 copies of the magazines have been mailed\u000d\u000a      to schools nationally and distributed at events such as the Big Bang Fair,\u000d\u000a      generating wider awareness and knowledge of Cassini research.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 the programme won the London Education Partnership Award for \"Excellent\u000a        professional practice in curriculum and student support in STEM\"\u000d\u000a      [5]. The Head of Morpeth School said at the time: \"Ten years ago we\u000d\u000a        would never have dreamt that we would be involved in a high profile\u000d\u000a        project on science supported by leading scientists from Queen Mary\u000d\u000a        University and NASA and having parents, teachers and students involved\u000d\u000a        in a live video link with Cassini Mission specialists\". In a later\u000d\u000a      statement he also writes \"The pupils who attend Morpeth come\u000d\u000a        overwhelmingly from disadvantaged backgrounds with virtually no history\u000d\u000a        of Higher Education in their families. For many of the Media Space\u000d\u000a        participants this was a unique opportunity to engage with high profile\u000d\u000a        astronomical research and to interact with professional scientists such\u000d\u000a        as Professor Murray. The experience provided by the Media Space\u000d\u000a        Programme, including the awe-inspiring images of Saturn and its rings\u000d\u000a        that the pupils worked with on their projects, had a massive impact on\u000d\u000a        our pupils. It is always dangerous to exaggerate but for one or two of\u000d\u000a        our pupils it may have been life changing\" [2]. Heather MacRae,\u000d\u000a      Creative Director of the Ideas Foundation and Director of Venture Thinking\u000d\u000a      commented: \"There is no doubt that Media Space achieved its primary\u000d\u000a        aims.

There were over 20,000 views of the content for the\u000d\u000a      Cosmic Futures competition and it was featured in the Metro newspaper six\u000d\u000a      times (average daily circulation around one million). Media Space\u000d\u000a      attendees and competition winners have participated in teleconferences\u000d\u000a      with Cassini scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and their\u000d\u000a      achievements have been celebrated at Parliamentary Space Committee\u000d\u000a      Christmas receptions.\u000d\u000a    Astrophysics Summer Schools\u000d\u000a      Our Astrophysics Summer Schools have increased the awareness, knowledge\u000d\u000a      and interest of secondary school teachers. By giving them the confidence\u000d\u000a      to tackle complex issues we have transformed their teaching practice.\u000d\u000a      Since 1998, as part of The Goldsmiths' Company's Science for Society\u000d\u000a      courses, the AU has run a five-day residential course on Astrophysics.\u000d\u000a      Exceptions were 2008, when organiser Prof. Emerson oversaw building of the\u000d\u000a      VISTA telescope, and during the 2012 Olympics. Each year approximately\u000d\u000a      twenty-five secondary school teachers participate in lectures and\u000d\u000a      workshops run by AU academics. Each lecture and workshop is based on an\u000d\u000a      academic's research, and includes background information and material\u000d\u000a      drawn directly from research outputs. Cassini-members lectured on the\u000d\u000a      search for satellites, the dynamics of the rings (with specific focus on\u000d\u000a      the F-ring) and on Enceladus (between 2009-2013) [R1-R4]; Prof. Nelson\u000d\u000a      lectured on planet formation, using his own research insights and material\u000d\u000a      drawn from his research publication in 2000 [R5] to explain the formation\u000d\u000a      of hot Jupiter exoplanets (2009-2013); Prof. Burgess lectured on space\u000d\u000a      weather, and used research insights from his publication in 2001 [R6] to\u000d\u000a      discuss how spacecraft can predict geomagnetic storms (2009-2013). After\u000d\u000a      attending, teachers have access to presentations online and each other's\u000d\u000a      contact details for sharing of ideas. Attendees give feedback through a\u000d\u000a      questionnaire, and we conducted a follow-up survey in 2012 to gauge\u000d\u000a      impact. The 2012 survey had a 28% response rate and 60% of responses\u000d\u000a      \"strongly agree\" and 30% \"agree\" that the course had an impact on their\u000d\u000a      teaching practice. 77% responded to say that they used course content in\u000d\u000a      lessons. Selected comments from the survey include [7]: \"I attended the\u000d\u000a        course because I wanted to strengthen and extend my knowledge about\u000d\u000a        current thinking and research in astronomy\"; \"Some of the\u000d\u000a        lectures which we were given copies of, I have used some slides in my\u000d\u000a        lessons.

That has left a great\u000d\u000a        impression.\"; and \"I have taught and taken the GCSE in astronomy\u000d\u000a        and run it as an after school club.\"\u000d\u000a    The questionnaires distributed at the end of each summer school include a\u000d\u000a      quality rating of the course's utility and training (0=poor to\u000d\u000a      10=excellent). Averaging responses from 2009 onward, the percentages given\u000d\u000a      for each quality score were: 5 (1.6%), 6 (5%), 7 (8.3%), 8 (16.6%), 9\u000d\u000a      (38.3%),10 (30%). Questionnaire responses consist largely of written\u000d\u000a      comments about the course impact. Analysis shows that in response to\u000d\u000a      attending the summer schools, five teachers plan to set up a new astronomy\u000d\u000a      club; four teachers plan to expand the activities of existing clubs; four\u000d\u000a      teachers plan to use the National Schools' Observatory; five teachers plan\u000d\u000a      to introduce GCSE Astronomy; 36% indicate that they were motivated to\u000d\u000a      attend to learn about current research, and\/or valued the research content\u000d\u000a      of the course; 35% indicated that they gained the confidence required to\u000d\u000a      tackle complex topics in the classroom; 33% indicated that they and\/or\u000d\u000a      their students would be inspired\/stretched\/motivated because of their\u000d\u000a      attendance on the course.

AU research through the Cassini mission to Saturn has\u000d\u000a      provided a powerful means of engaging school students with astronomy\u000d\u000a      research, in addition to contributing strongly to our engagement with\u000d\u000a      school teachers.\u000d\u000a    Professor Carl Murray is the sole UK member of the Cassini imaging team.\u000d\u000a      He was personally responsible for the discovery in 2005 and 2008 of two\u000d\u000a      new moons of Saturn detected in Cassini images, Polydeuces [R1]\u000d\u000a      and Anthe [R2], and provided a rigorous analysis of their orbits\u000d\u000a      and interactions with neighbouring satellites. The research demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that Polydeuces is an unusual coorbital satellite in a tadpole\u000d\u000a      orbit with Dione, and showed that Anthe occupies a\u000d\u000a      dynamically important 10:11 resonance with Mimas. Murray has\u000d\u000a      pioneered the study of Saturn's F-ring and its interaction with the nearby\u000d\u000a      satellite Prometheus, and provided the first explanation for the complex,\u000d\u000a      time-dependent structures observed in the ring by the Cassini spacecraft\u000d\u000a      [R3].

His paper from\u000d\u000a      2000 was the first to demonstrate how concurrent migration and gas\u000d\u000a      accretion by giant planets operates [R5], and has been highly influential\u000d\u000a      in discussions of how `hot Jupiter' exoplanets form.

One\u000d\u000a      particularly important use of the NeXT filter has been in the\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical industry, where: \"These low frequency modes were\u000d\u000a        invaluable in supporting the characterisation of drug polymorphs and\u000d\u000a        formulations. They helped define both the properties of these polymorphs\u000d\u000a        and their behaviour. To address the challenge of probing this spectral\u000d\u000a        region, I evaluated industrialized and research solutions in Fourier\u000d\u000a        Transform far-infrared, Terahertz and Raman spectroscopies. The two\u000d\u000a        former were shown to be of limited value. Raman spectroscopy clearly was\u000d\u000a        the technology of choice.\" [2].\u000d\u000a    A considerable amount of research has been undertaken into drug\u000d\u000a      polymorphism by the pharmaceutical industry &#8212; partly because polymorphs\u000d\u000a      (different structural forms of a given molecule) are patentable, and this\u000d\u000a      can have advantages for industry in extending the patent lifetime of the\u000d\u000a      drug, but also because of the risk polymorphism poses to the effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of a drug. According to the Chief Scientific officer at pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      research company SAFC-Pharmorphix: \"The worst that can happen for a\u000d\u000a        pharmaceutical company is if a new polymorph suddenly appears in the\u000d\u000a        temperature and humidity conditions of a blister-pack when a compound is\u000d\u000a        actually on the market\" [7]. This is because new polymorphs can\u000d\u000a      alter the bioactivity of a drug, for example through changes in\u000d\u000a      solubility. A number of techniques have been used to study polymorphism\u000d\u000a      such as X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy, but given that\u000d\u000a      polymorphs can be formed by subtle changes in crystallisation due to\u000d\u000a      solvent, temperature, cooling rates, etc, there is an active market in\u000d\u000a      high throughput characterisation techniques. Attempts have been made to\u000d\u000a      use other techniques such as FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) and\u000d\u000a      Terahertz spectroscopy, but these have proved ineffective and the\u000d\u000a      introduction of the NeXT filter to Raman microscopes added significant\u000d\u000a      value as the low frequency modes \"helped define both the properties of\u000d\u000a        these polymorphs and their behaviour.\" [2]. This was in part due to\u000d\u000a      the fact that \"it was routine\" and \"relatively easy to maintain\"\u000d\u000a      [2], but also the removal of a large scanning triple spectrometer meant\u000d\u000a      that spectra can be collected on a CCD array with fast integration times\u000d\u000a      (due to the higher light throughput). \"It was a major step forward\u000d\u000a        giving industrial labs access to a traditionally difficult spectroscopic\u000d\u000a        region.\" [2]\u000d\u000a    Optical-engineering gives Absolute Action Ltd a competitive edge\u000d\u000a      Dunstan began his consultancy with Absolute Action Ltd in 1996\/97 when\u000d\u000a      they approached him with the challenge of illuminating the Hope Diamond in\u000d\u000a      the Smithsonian, which is often quoted as being the most viewed museum\u000d\u000a      artefact in the world. The diamond is set in a ring of brilliant white\u000d\u000a      diamonds and visitors were frequently disappointed because the original\u000d\u000a      lighting caught the white diamonds so much that the blue diamond appeared\u000d\u000a      dull in comparison. Dunstan used his research expertise in\u000d\u000a      optical-engineering, developed through his experimental research in\u000d\u000a      coupling samples contained in Diamond Anvil Cells to the Renishaw\u000d\u000a      microscope, to design a lighting system that used fibre-fed imaging optics\u000d\u000a      coupled with a graticule to provide as much light as possible on the Hope\u000d\u000a      Diamond while minimising the light level on the surrounding diamonds. This\u000d\u000a      resulted in the current display where the Hope Diamond \"sparkles, dazzles\u000d\u000a      and glows\" [The Times, reference 8]. The curator of the National\u000d\u000a      Gem and Mineral collection at the Smithsonian stated that: \"annual\u000d\u000a        viewing figures since 2008 have been approximately 5 million, compared\u000d\u000a        to only about 3 million before this lighting was installed\" [3].\u000d\u000a    In 2003 Dunstan designed the lighting for the Memorial to\u000d\u000a      Japanese-American Patriotism and the lighting system that illuminates the\u000d\u000a      paintings in the British Embassy in Paris. The key knowledge transfer from\u000d\u000a      the experimental research was developing the ability to place light, at\u000d\u000a      whatever intensity or colour and at whatever place, with whatever\u000d\u000a      variation over time, that may be desired by a lighting designer or client.\u000d\u000a      The design rules and computer software developed by Dunstan to achieve\u000d\u000a      this were given to Absolute Action Ltd, allowing them to use this\u000d\u000a      technology in many subsequent contracts [4].\u000d\u000a    This has given Absolute Action Ltd a distinct competitive edge. Although\u000d\u000a      there is no IPR protection or patentable technology in the designs Dunstan\u000d\u000a      has given the company, the know-how and confidence to tender for\u000d\u000a      commissions that competitors cannot meet has led to many top-end contracts\u000d\u000a      and a very strong reputation. Absolute Action Ltd states that this\u000d\u000a      technology \"enables us to secure projects of elevated intrinsic value,\u000d\u000a        to satisfy the kind of clients who will come back for more, and to\u000d\u000a        reinforce our Company's status as providers of unique services in\u000d\u000a        high-profile projects.\" [4]. They estimate that these high value\u000d\u000a      projects have accounted for ~&#163;1m in revenue since 2008, which is \"not\u000d\u000a        an insignificant contribution to the commercial health of a small entity\u000d\u000a        such as we are\". It has also \"elevated our company to the status\u000d\u000a        of Lighting Specialists of Choice for some of the Smithsonian\u000d\u000a        Institution's most vaunted exhibitions- including inter alia the\u000d\u000a        illumination of the Dresden Green Diamond, the Wonder of Pearls\u000d\u000a        exhibition and the Fancy Diamonds Exhibit.\" This status and the\u000d\u000a      reputation that goes with it helps them to continue to secure high\u000d\u000a      prestige projects such as illuminating the exclusive Carnet jewellery\u000d\u000a      store in Hong Kong and Carnet exhibition in London (2010), and a\u000d\u000a      commission from Foster &amp; Partners to illuminate Buddhist sculptures in\u000d\u000a      the Kamakura private residence in Japan (2010). Bespoke lighting design\u000d\u000a      companies who have partnered Absolute Action Ltd have also received\u000d\u000a      commercial benefit through utilisation of these technologies [5].\u000d\u000a    Museums and art galleries\u000d\u000a      The impact of this work is currently on display around the world in both\u000d\u000a      public and private permanent collections. The initial work on the Hope\u000d\u000a      Diamond has led to a number of contracts for exhibitions. For example, the\u000d\u000a      Vault at the Natural History Museum in London displays the institution's\u000d\u000a      most valuable collection of gemstones and minerals in a permanent exhibit.\u000d\u000a      The approach is being increasingly used in art galleries where there is a\u000d\u000a      need to have very discrete luminaires which place light (with no damaging\u000d\u000a      UV component) solely onto the artwork to be displayed. By removing the\u000d\u000a      light overspill the painting or sculpture appears to stand out from the\u000d\u000a      background, greatly enhancing the impact on the viewer. This technology\u000d\u000a      has now been used for displaying artwork in locations as varied as\u000d\u000a      Cliveden, The Van Loon Museum in Amsterdam and The Garrick Club in London,\u000d\u000a      as well as the British Embassy in Paris.\u000d\u000a    Secondary impact is generated by the enhanced viewing experience of the\u000d\u000a      public provided by these lighting systems. The resulting cultural capital\u000d\u000a      leads to improvements in the quality of life. The increased interest and\u000d\u000a      engagement of the general public has a positive impact on the\u000d\u000a      sustainability of public museums through increased visitor numbers, as\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the increase from three to five million visitors to the Hope\u000d\u000a      Diamond after the new lighting was installed [3].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on the spectroscopy of materials conducted by Prof. Dunstan has\u000d\u000a      led to novel innovations for the Renishaw Raman microscope that have been\u000d\u000a      patented and marketed by Renishaw plc, a UK-based global instrumentation\u000d\u000a      company, as part of their inVia microscope range in the form of the NeXT\u000d\u000a      filter. These innovations have provided the company with significant\u000d\u000a      commercial advantage over their competitors and allowed the\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals industry to develop applications for this technology in\u000d\u000a      the areas of amorphous drugs, stability testing and polymorph screening.\u000d\u000a      Dunstan's spectroscopy research has also enabled him to work with Absolute\u000d\u000a      Action Ltd, a company which provides bespoke lighting systems for museums,\u000d\u000a      galleries, public spaces and homes.

His research\u000d\u000a      is concerned with spectroscopic analysis of advanced materials under\u000d\u000a      high-pressure, for which he designed and developed diamond-anvil\u000d\u000a      high-pressure cells (DACs) that enable materials to be studied in the\u000d\u000a      laboratory at pressures comparable to the those at the centre of the Earth\u000d\u000a      [R1]. On his arrival at QMUL, Dunstan purchased a Renishaw Raman\u000d\u000a      microscope for application to his high-pressure spectroscopic studies. It\u000d\u000a      is this research, and the innovations in optical engineering that he\u000d\u000a      developed to allow him to perform this research between 1996-2003, that\u000d\u000a      have led to the impacts described in section 4.\u000d\u000a    Prof Batchelder's group at QMUL designed the Renishaw Raman microscope in\u000d\u000a      the 1980s [R2]. Dunstan purchased one of these from Renishaw when he moved\u000d\u000a      to QMUL. This instrument was the most advanced in the field, however it\u000d\u000a      had limitations that restricted its use. The Raman signal is approximately\u000d\u000a      1 million times weaker than the normal scattered light from the laser\u000d\u000a      source, and hence an extremely sharp filter is required to remove the\u000d\u000a      scattered light in order to detect the weak Raman signal. In the original\u000d\u000a      Raman microscope this was done using holographic filters, but these had\u000d\u000a      two major drawbacks. First, they only worked with a single wavelength of\u000d\u000a      light so resonant Raman spectroscopy, which greatly improves sensitivity,\u000d\u000a      could not be performed. Second, the filters were insufficiently sensitive\u000d\u000a      to allow measurements at wavelengths very close (&lt;100cm-1)\u000d\u000a      to the original laser; this is the region where much useful information\u000d\u000a      can be found.\u000d\u000a    From 1996 onward Dunstan applied high-pressure spectroscopy techniques to\u000d\u000a      strained-layer semiconductor structures and carbon nanotubes to study\u000d\u000a      their properties using DACs coupled to the Renishaw Raman microscope [R3,\u000d\u000a      R4]. His results presented in [R4] showed that it is essential to select\u000d\u000a      the right nanotubes for study by resolving the radial breathing Raman\u000d\u000a      mode, as this characterises the diameter of the nanotubes. The strength of\u000d\u000a      the signal depends critically on the wavelength of the exciting laser\u000d\u000a      light, so that has to be tuned to pick out individual nanotubes.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore this radial breathing mode is at low Raman shift, near the\u000d\u000a      excitation light. These two issues were completely opposite to what the\u000d\u000a      standard holographic filters were designed to provide, and as a result\u000d\u000a      Dunstan had to develop a completely new approach to removing the tunable\u000d\u000a      laser excitation, while maintaining the low Raman shift information\u000d\u000a      required by his experiments. It was the need to address these two problems\u000d\u000a      that led him to build the Near-eXcitation Tuneable (NeXT) filter that was\u000d\u000a      published in 2002 [R5] and a patent granted in 2003 [R6]. The experimental\u000d\u000a      set-ups leading to the results published in [R3, R4] required critical\u000d\u000a      innovations in optical engineering using fibre-optics and other techniques\u000d\u000a      to couple the light output from the samples contained in the DACs with the\u000d\u000a      Raman spectrometer. The requirement for this coupling to be achieved with\u000d\u000a      minimal loss is particularly severe because of the extreme weakness of the\u000d\u000a      Raman signal. Dunstan's research requirements exposed other limitations in\u000d\u000a      the Raman microscope. The use of a microscope to obtain the special\u000d\u000a      resolution required generally limited its application to objects that\u000d\u000a      could fit under a microscope objective. Dunstan invented an\u000d\u000a      \"Omni-directional beam steering unit\" that could be fitted to any\u000d\u000a      microscope and allows objects to be studied at any angle or distance from\u000d\u000a      the microscope. He also invented a new grating turret and developed the\u000d\u000a      interface software.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18942","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    From da Vinci's The Vitruvian Man through to the experimental\u000a      writing of modernists such as Virginia Wolf and James Joyce, scientific\u000a      ideas have long informed artistic works. The collaborative work of Berman\u000a      and Still with contemporary artists ensures this tradition survives today.\u000a    Collaborating with artists and informing their work\u000a    Research carried out at Queen Mary's Centre for Research in String Theory\u000a      (CRST) and in the Particle Physics Research Centre (PPRC) has proved a\u000a      rich source of inspiration for numerous artists including Grenville Davey,\u000a      Jordan Wolfson, Flow Motion, Nelly Ben Hayoun, Lyndall Phelps and\u000a      twenty-five artist-participants in Still's Jiggling Atoms\u000a      collaboration.

Davey's work over a period of years had been concerned with\u000a      symmetries and families of related objects and as such he had a natural\u000a      interest in Berman's work on manifesting duality geometrically.\u000a    Commenting on his time at CRST and his sculptural responses to the work\u000a      on generalized geometry and the role of duality, Davey said: \"The work\u000a        at Queen Mary on dualities and generalised geometry provides a new\u000a        challenging way of seeing... This is the sort of thing artists search\u000a        for and are desperate to find in their work.

These works have been shown or will appear at:\u000a    \u000a      Testbed1 (a gallery linked with the Royal College of Art) as part of\u000a        the \"Our autonomous nature\" exhibition (May 2012) in the Chelsea fringe\u000a        festival, (with audiences of around 1,000);\u000a      Isaac Newton Institute exhibition at Cambridge University Library\u000a        (June 2012) as part of an art- science talk (audience of 100);\u000a      Financial Services Authority, Canary Wharf (summer 2012);\u000a      The Arts Club, a private members club in Mayfair, (October 2013);\u000a      Chelsea Space Gallery (April 2014) and Ruskin Gallery in Cambridge\u000a        (May 2014).\u000a    \u000a    Award-winning collaboration with Jordan Wolfson at the Frieze Arts\u000a        Fair\u000a    In 2009, Berman collaborated with conceptual artist Jordan Wolfson to\u000a      produce a work for the Frieze Arts Fair, one of the world's leading art\u000a      events attracting over 60,000 visitors each year. The resulting artwork\u000a      won that year's prestigious Cartier Award and consisted of several parts,\u000a      including a series of one-to-one tours of the fair by CRST string\u000a      theorists (Dr Berman, D Thompson, A Low, J Bedford, M McGaurie). These\u000a      tours, described as \"nomadic seminars on string theory\", introduced over\u000a      300 influential artists, art journalists, curators and gallery owners to\u000a      the conceptual aspects of string theory research at the CRST. A further\u000a      300 people watched the tours take place and the conversations were\u000a      recorded, edited and used by the artist as a script for a live\u000a      performance. This led to a further commission (worth &#163;10,000) for Wolfson,\u000a      which led him to make \"Your Napoleon: an intervention based on the string\u000a      theory of physics\" [2,3].\u000a    The resulting impact on public discourse via media coverage\u000a    The project at the Frieze Arts Fair attracted attention not only from the\u000a      60,000 attendees but also in the widespread arts media coverage in the Guardian,\u000a      New York Times, Wired Magazine, and The Arts Magazine\u000a      [8]. The presence of science-inspired stories in the arts media (and of\u000a      arts-inspired stories in the lay-science media) clearly demonstrates the\u000a      impact the work has had in building an awareness of science\/art\u000a      collaborations. This awareness has manifested in an invited article about\u000a      the collaboration in New Scientist [9]. Berman's work with Davey\u000a      has also received attention internationally with an invited talk and\u000a      subsequent article about the collaboration for the Korean Institute for\u000a      Advanced Study (September 2012) and for the Japanese popular science\u000a      magazine Parity (autumn 2013). A talk and exhibition of the Davey\u000a      collaboration at the private members club The Arts Club in London took\u000a      place in October 2013.\u000a    One of the Guardian's cultural critics Sam Wollaston wrote of his\u000a      experience at the Frieze Arts Fair: \"Part of a project devised by US\u000a        artist Jordan Wolfson, the strolling chat with Dr Berman quickly gets\u000a        beyond three dimensions to four, which I'm just about OK with (the\u000a        fourth is time), but then he's suddenly talking about 10 of them. Ten\u000a        dimensions! It works mathematically, apparently. And these dimensions\u000a        are really small and tightly rolled up - Berman demonstrates this with\u000a        my notebook....... it sounds beautiful.\" (Guardian, 15\u000a      October 2009.)\u000a    Other CRST work with artists\u000a    CRST research on dualities has also influenced the sound artists Flow\u000a      Motion [4], who created a piece called \"Exploring eleven dimensions\". This\u000a      artwork was produced in direct response to extensive discussions with Dr\u000a      Berman and Dr James Sparks (Oxford) regarding ideas in M-theory. Performed\u000a      to audiences of 250 at the Science Museum's Dana Centre and at Queen Mary\u000a      in November 2011, it was funded by an EPSRC pathways to impact grant. Dr\u000a      Berman has also given talks on his research, and its role in his\u000a      arts-collaborations, at the Institute for Contemporary Art, Tate Modern,\u000a      the Royal College of Art, and the Core Gallery, with audience numbers\u000a      being around 100 for each event. After listening to one of Berman's talks\u000a      artist Lia Perjovski said: \"M-theory does what art should do: it\u000a        challenges our view of the world and challenges what I mean [by] art.\"\u000a      Berman will be curating an exhibition at the Ruskin and Chelsea Space\u000a      Galleries in 2014, and has previously curated an exhibition at Clare Hall,\u000a      Cambridge in 2008.\u000a    Evelyn Wilson, Director, The Culture Capital Exchange, attested to the\u000a      value of the CRST working with artists: \"It is the kind of\u000a        ground-breaking collaborations that are being fostered so carefully at\u000a        Queen Mary that is paving the way for so many more of us to think afresh\u000a        about world in which we live.\" The CRST's arts engagement strategy\u000a      is on-going with plans to continue the artist-in- residency programme into\u000a      2014\/15 accompanying the previously mentioned exhibitions scheduled for\u000a      2014.\u000a    PPRC work with artists\u000a    Dr Still has received two IoP awards for his collaborative work with\u000a      artists [11]. He worked with designer Nelly Ben Hayoun on the Super K\u000a        Sonic Booooum! installation, an immersive mock-up of the T2K\u000a      neutrino experiment that was exhibited at a London nightclub in 2009 and\u000a      at the Manchester Science fair in 2010. More than 1600 visitors\u000a      experienced an interactive boat ride through the installation accompanied\u000a      by a PPRC researcher who acted as a tour guide explaining the PPRC's\u000a      neutrino physics research. An accompanying blog and website describing the\u000a      research behind the installation had more than 3000 unique visits over the\u000a      duration of the exhibit. An STFC Science in Society grant (&#163;8.8K) funded\u000a      the collaboration. Jiggling Atoms was a six-month collaboration\u000a      between Still and 25 artists that resulted in a strong impact on their\u000a      artistic practice and enhanced awareness of PPRC's particle physics\u000a      research [6]. Visual interpretations of complex neutrino physics concepts\u000a      were created in response to conversations and lectures about the PPRC's\u000a      research, including illustrations and sculptures depicting neutrino\u000a      oscillations. These were exhibited at a week long physics festival hosted\u000a      by a London gallery during October 2012, that also included talks and\u000a      discussions by Still, and was attended by over 1000 visitors.\u000a    More recently, Still was chosen to pioneer the new IoP\u000a      artist-in-residence programme Superposition, in partnership with\u000a      contemporary artist Lyndall Phelps, which ran for a year from October\u000a      2012. This culminated in a sculpture that symbolizes the detection of\u000a      neutrinos in the T2K experiment and the associated data analysis. This was\u000a      exhibited at the London Canal Museum during September and October 2013\u000a      with over 1900 visitors. An accompanying brochure contains essays by Still\u000a      and Tom Freshwater, the Contemporary Art Programme Manager at the National\u000a      Trust that discuss the scientific and artistic significance of the\u000a      sculpture\u000a      (http:\/\/ph.qmul.ac.uk\/sites\/default\/files\/REF\/SUPERPOSITION_BOOKLET.pdf).\u000a      After working on the Superposition project Lyndall Phelps commented \"...I\u000a        was hooked straight away, especially after seeing images of\u000a        Super-Kamiokande. My pre-conception that physics might be a tad dry and\u000a        abstract was shattered, replaced by the promise of poetry and rich\u000a        sensory experiences\" [5].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Few scientists in the UK have done as much as Dr David Berman and Dr Ben\u000a      Still to bring the latest ideas and results from string theory and\u000a      particle physics research into the contemporary art world. In 2010, Berman\u000a      established an artist-in-residence post at QMUL's Centre for Research in\u000a      String Theory, with Turner Prize winner Grenville Davey the first artist\u000a      to take up the residency. This collaboration led to Davey creating\u000a      sculptural responses to the Centre's work on generalized geometry and the\u000a      role of duality, which have been exhibited widely. Berman has also\u000a      collaborated with conceptual artist Jordan Wolfson for a work at the\u000a      Frieze Arts Fair, which won the prestigious Cartier Award in 2009. He has\u000a      given talks at the Institute for Contemporary Art, the Royal College of\u000a      Art, Tate Modern and the Core Gallery, and will be curating further\u000a      exhibitions in 2014. Still has initiated award-winning collaborations with\u000a      artists, creating diverse artworks that draw-on QMUL's experimental\u000a      research on neutrino physics, which have been exhibited at numerous\u000a      venues. This work has transformed the practice of artists and brought\u000a      complex theories and conceptual ideas to audiences that may not have had\u000a      much previous knowledge or interest in these areas. Attracting widespread\u000a      media coverage in both the arts and science press, the work has encouraged\u000a      greater public discourse around string theory and particle physics.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen Mary, University of London","InstitutionName":"Queen Mary, University of London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007775}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] `M-theory Branes and their interactions', D.S.

One of string\u000a      theory's central ideas is the concept of \"duality\". This is a hidden\u000a      symmetry of the theory that relates different spacetime geometries (recall\u000a      how in Einstein's theory of general relativity, space and time combine\u000a      into a single curved space - the curvature of the space relates to the\u000a      gravitational field). Because of this duality symmetry, space- times that\u000a      appear naively different may in fact be physically equivalent.\u000a    Between 2008 and 2013, Dr David Berman's research [1-4] has focussed on\u000a      reformulating string theory to make the duality symmetries a manifest\u000a      property of a new formalism to describe string theory. There are many\u000a      reasons to do this. Symmetry is at the heart of theoretical physics and\u000a      any formalism should attempt to make manifest the symmetries present in a\u000a      physical theory.\u000a    The key idea in allowing duality to become manifest has been to extend\u000a      the number of dimensions of spacetime and have what we think of as the\u000a      physical spacetime emerge as a projection [3,4]. Different projections\u000a      then correspond to what we think of as different spacetime geometries\u000a      when, in fact, in this formulation they are just different projections of\u000a      a single extended spacetime [3,4]. Importantly, once this reformulation\u000a      has been achieved it also suggests new and exciting physical backgrounds\u000a      for string theory such as so-called \"non-geometric backgrounds\", which are\u000a      space- times that cannot be described within general relativity, but can\u000a      with the new duality manifest formulation. These non-geometric backgrounds\u000a      exist because they are perfectly well behaved geometries from the extended\u000a      point of view, but the projection onto a single ordinary spacetime cannot\u000a      be achieved due to topological restrictions. These backgrounds appear to\u000a      have crucial phenomenological properties that have yet to be fully\u000a      explored.\u000a    In addition to this work on making hidden symmetries manifest, Berman has\u000a      studied how objects in string theory such as strings and membranes\u000a      interact [1,2]. The link to the reformulation of string theory comes from\u000a      the physical constraint that these objects must see the extended space and\u000a      the projected space in the same way, and their interactions must work the\u000a      same in both spaces.\u000a    Research in QMUL's Particle Physics Research Centre (PPRC) is concerned\u000a      with understanding the fundamental constituents of the universe and their\u000a      forces of interaction. Dr Still and other PPRC colleagues play a central\u000a      role in the T2K experiment in Japan, where a long baseline neutrino beam\u000a      is aimed at the Super-Kamiokande detector in an attempt to understand the\u000a      interactions and strange oscillation behaviour of neutrino particles.\u000a      Oscillations, in which one type of neutrino may change into one of the two\u000a      other types over a journey of many kilometres, are key indicators of\u000a      underlying fundamental physics. Recent breakthroughs in understanding have\u000a      come from landmark research to which Dr Still and colleagues have made\u000a      significant contributions [5].\u000a    Our research in fundamental physics has inspired artists who are drawn to\u000a      the focus on geometry; the idea of spacetime itself being a projection or\u000a      shadow from a larger extended space; the hidden duality symmetry being a\u000a      consequence of different projections or perspectives. A key motivation has\u000a      been the desire to find innovative ways of representing QMUL's research\u000a      into complex subatomic processes; to explore areas where the language of\u000a      physics has entered the common lexicon but the underlying concepts remain\u000a      abstract and mysterious.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19663","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Policy implications\u000a    The most important policy implication of this research was that the\u000a      current focus of climate mitigation policy, limiting rates of greenhouse\u000a      gas emissions in 2020 and 2050, is misplaced: effective mitigation\u000a      policies need to limit the total cumulative release, not just the rate of\u000a      emission in any given year. This matters, because not all measures to\u000a      reduce the rate of emission in the short term will necessarily be\u000a      effective in reducing the cumulative total.\u000a    Although the scientific case for limiting warming to 2oC\u000a      through emission reductions was noted in Copenhagen in 2009, specific\u000a      measures indicating how this was to be achieved were not agreed. The need\u000a      to limit cumulative emissions has substantial political implications, such\u000a      as short- versus long-term effects, and industrialised versus developing\u000a      world responsibilities.\u000a    The cumulative carbon emissions point was made by Allen i) in\u000a      presentations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u000a      delegates in Bonn and Copenhagen; ii) in separate briefings to senior\u000a      civil servants in the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and\u000a      the Department for International Development (DFID); iii) in evidence to\u000a      the UK Climate Change Committee; iv) to the Royal Society (who have\u000a      acknowledged the importance of cumulative emissions in public statements\u000a      [A]); v) to the Parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee's 2009 enquiry\u000a      into carbon budgets [B]. Allen also developed a visual demonstration of\u000a      the cumulative carbon concept that he presented at the UN Climate Change\u000a      Conference (COP18) in 2012. The DECC\/Defra-funded AVOID programme, which\u000a      provides advice to government on climate change, includes discussion of\u000a      cumulative emissions in its analysis of whether the pledges in the\u000a      Copenhagen Accord are consistent with the desired 2&#176;C warming limit, and\u000a      references [1] directly [C]. The campaign group Sandbag, founded by\u000a      Baroness Worthington, has used the trillionth tonne concept in its\u000a      analysis and subsequently in two of its 2010 viewpoint papers, which also\u000a      cite [1] directly [D]. Sandbag uses these to lobby governments on\u000a      emissions trading. It also advises the public and organisations about\u000a      personal carbon offsetting strategies, for example discouraging tree\u000a      planting offsetting which, while it reduces carbon concentrations, does\u000a      not affect the cumulative carbon emitted.\u000a    Allen's research in [5] directly influenced one of the key conclusions of\u000a      the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment\u000a      report. The report concludes that limiting the warming caused by\u000a      anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone to less than 2&#176;C (with a probability\u000a      greater than 66%) will require cumulative CO2 emissions from all\u000a      anthropogenic sources to stay between 0 and about 1000 gigatonnes of\u000a      carbon. These estimates were based on the concept of Transient Response to\u000a      Cumulative Carbon Emissions (TRCE) from [5], which was a variant of the\u000a      cumulative warming commitment proposed in [1]. Allen was a\u000a      draft-contributing author for the assessment of the literature on TRCE in\u000a      the IPCC 5th Assessment. The final draft, highlighting the importance of\u000a      the trillion tonne budget, was submitted to governments on 7th June, 2013.\u000a      Paper [5] is cited in the full report and the summary for policy makers.\u000a      Although these were published after the REF impact period, and so we are\u000a      not claiming impacts that are a consequence of the final report, it is\u000a      clear that Allen's research has heavily influenced the IPCC report.\u000a    Impacts on Carbon Capture and Storage\u000a    Petrochemical companies have been influenced by Allen's work and the\u000a      trillionth tonne concept. In particular, Shell has used the cumulative\u000a      carbon approach to climate change to inform their investments in carbon\u000a      capture and storage (CCS) and also their long-term energy scenario\u000a      planning. Shell said: \"Carbon capture and storage will be a critical\u000a        technology for society over the course of this century [...] more\u000a        recently its importance has been cemented in our thinking by the\u000a        `trillion tonne' work that Professor Allen and his team have delivered\u000a        since 2009\" [E].\u000a    Shell has directly used the research to influence their investment in\u000a      carbon capture and storage. They said: \"The `trillion tonne stock'\u000a        approach has helped us build internal support for our CCS investments in\u000a        Canada and Norway and more recently has been used by the team leading\u000a        our potential UK CCS project.\" The investments, informed by Allen's\u000a      work, are significant. For example, the Quest CCS site in Canada is\u000a      currently under construction at a total cost of $1.35bn. Shell is leading\u000a      the commercial joint venture (60%) with two other companies and government\u000a      funding. The final investment decision was taken by Shell in September\u000a      2012 and the facility is due to start operating in 2015.\u000a    Shell also identified impacts of the research on their Scenarios\u000a      documents, which they have used for 40 years to challenge executives'\u000a      perspectives on the future business environment using plausible\u000a      assumptions and quantification. \"Our new Lens Scenarios makes\u000a        extensive use of carbon stock thinking as we seek to show that the\u000a        climate issue can be resolved over this century given the application of\u000a        CCS\", said Shell. In their current Scenarios document future\u000a      emissions are described with respect to cumulative emissions. In one\u000a      future scenario \"the cumulative emissions situation by the middle of\u000a        the century means an overshoot of the 2&#176;C goal, but the expanded use of\u000a        CCS as a carbon sink later in the period provides a critical component\u000a        to a potential pathway for managing net global emissions\" [E].\u000a    Press coverage\u000a    \u000a    Allen has given numerous press interviews on the cumulative carbon\u000a      results. The Guardian newspaper highlighted [1] on first\u000a      publication, including quotes from Allen [F]. Later that year, at the\u000a      start of the Copenhagen conference, a coordinated editorial was published\u000a      in 56 newspapers [G], often as the front page, in 20 languages. This\u000a      raised the issue, \"how we will share a newly precious resource: the\u000a        trillion or so tonnes of carbon that we can emit before the mercury\u000a        rises to dangerous levels\", with discussion of the required balance\u000a      between industrialised and developing worlds. The text was drafted by a Guardian\u000a      team during more than a month of consultations with editors from more than\u000a      20 of the papers involved, and raised 1072 on-line comments on the Guardian\u000a      website in three days. The editorial also forms part of a wider\u000a      sustainability campaign by the newspaper called `10:10'.\u000a    Stimulating public engagement and debate\u000a    \u000a    In October 2009, alongside the final round of pre-Copenhagen talks, a\u000a      heap of coal representing the `trillionth tonne' was on display in the\u000a      Science Museum in London as part of their exhibition, `Prove It!' (Oct\u000a      2009 - Feb 2010). The coal is to be kept by the Museum of Oxford until its\u000a      combustion is required. Professor Chris Rapley, then the Science Museum's\u000a      Director, told a news conference, \"to avoid dangerous climate\u000a        change...we must never release into the atmosphere the carbon dioxide\u000a        from that trillionth tonne\" [H]. Professor Allen explained its\u000a      purpose and significance in a `Viewpoint' article for the BBC, which was\u000a      commented on in detail by readers from a range of countries and linked to\u000a      by campaign groups. In conjunction, a live, online countdown to emission\u000a      of the trillionth tonne is maintained by Oxford at http:\/\/trillionthtonne.org.\u000a    George Monbiot, a vociferous campaigner on the need to reduce emissions,\u000a      identified the 2009 pair of Nature papers along with one other as being\u000a      key steps towards more meaningful emission targets and concluded that \"the\u000a        targets and methodology being used by governments and the United Nations\u000a        &#8212; which will form the basis for their negotiations at Copenhagen &#8212; are\u000a        not even wrong; they are irrelevant\" [I]. Allen followed this with\u000a      his own critical commentary on the 10:10 campaign in the Guardian\u000a      in September 2009 [J].\u000a    Allen has also spoken on wider issues of climate policy arising from his\u000a      work at the Sustainable Planet Forum in Lyon (Sept 2010), reportedly\u000a      attended by 27,000 people, in a debate on climate politics with the former\u000a      French Environment Minister and leader of the French Green Party,\u000a      Dominique Voynet.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Results from climate physics research at the University of Oxford have\u000a      demonstrated that targets for cumulative carbon emissions, rather than\u000a      greenhouse gas concentrations, are a more effective approach to limiting\u000a      future climate change.

In April 2009, two\u000a      papers, Allen et al (2009) [1] and Meinshausen et al (2009), were\u000a      published as the cover story of Nature, the first led by Allen and\u000a      the second with his input and co-authorship. Both demonstrated that the\u000a      risk of dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system is\u000a      primarily determined by the total carbon dioxide emissions accumulated\u000a      over time, not by emissions in any given year or commitment period.\u000a    The research that prompted this work was also led by the University of\u000a      Oxford and assessed the risks associated with different stabilisation\u000a      concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases [2]. This concluded that\u000a      the long-term equilibrium warming consequence of a doubling of carbon\u000a      dioxide concentration (a common policy objective) could be substantially\u000a      higher than the previously predicted likely range of 2-4.5oC.\u000a      It also called into question the conventional paradigm of framing climate\u000a      policy in terms of targets for long-term stabilisation concentration [3],\u000a      and prompted further research into alternative policy targets that could\u000a      be more robustly constrained by the fundamental physics of the climate\u000a      system and available climate observations.\u000a    Allen's Nature paper [1] presented ensemble simulations of simple\u000a      climate-carbon-cycle models, constrained by observations and projections\u000a      from more comprehensive models, to simulate the temperature response to\u000a      250 carbon dioxide emission pathways covering a broad range of scenarios.\u000a      The key finding was that the peak warming resulting from a given\u000a      cumulative injection of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and hence into\u000a      the entire global system, is better constrained than the warming response\u000a      to scenarios of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations. Furthermore,\u000a      the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is\u000a      remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (such as timing of\u000a      emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting\u000a      cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to\u000a      scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets.\u000a    In particular, it was shown that to limit the estimated most likely\u000a      maximum global temperature rise caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide\u000a      emissions to 2oC above pre-industrial temperatures, the\u000a      cumulative injection over the entire industrial period needs to be limited\u000a      to one trillion tonnes of carbon, of which approximately 500 billion\u000a      tonnes has already been released. This gave rise to the concept of the\u000a      `trillionth tonne'. This was later confirmed to be robust for a broad\u000a      range of scenarios up to the year 2200 [4]. Allen has also led more recent\u000a      work to update the carbon budget using the latest observations and models\u000a      [5].\u000a    Professor Myles Allen led the work described here. He joined Oxford as a\u000a      NERC Advanced Fellow (2000-03), took up a Lectureship (2003-11) and is now\u000a      Professor of Geosystem Science (2011-present).

In its original incarnation, the Spectral Phase\u000d\u000a      Interferometry for Direct Electric field Reconstruction (SPIDER) method\u000d\u000a      was developed by Professor Ian Walmsley while at the University of\u000d\u000a      Rochester.\u000d\u000a    The SPIDER technique requires a pair of pulses (the unknown input or\u000d\u000a      'test` pulse and a time delayed copy) and another pulse, derived from the\u000d\u000a      same input pulse, which is strongly temporally broadened (`chirped'). A\u000d\u000a      nonlinear interaction, sum frequency generation, between the long chirped\u000d\u000a      signal and the test pulses, within a crystal, results in a frequency shift\u000d\u000a      between the pair. The optical spectrum of the combined signal of the two\u000d\u000a      pulses reveals the spectral\u000a        phase, as a function of frequency, and thus complete pulse\u000d\u000a      characterisation.\u000d\u000a    Although the SPIDER technique worked well, there were a number of\u000d\u000a      features that if simplified would make the instrument smaller, more robust\u000d\u000a      and more sensitive. After his arrival in Oxford in 2001, Walmsley set\u000d\u000a      about simplifying the design. His research at Oxford produced a series of\u000d\u000a      improvements resulting in a device that was smaller and easier to\u000d\u000a      integrate into existing laser systems, which enabled its uptake across a\u000d\u000a      wider group of users.\u000d\u000a    Walmsley realised the device could be made significantly simpler by\u000d\u000a      reconfiguring the nonlinear optical process used to generate the spectral\u000d\u000a      shear (that is, the differential frequency shift between two replicas of\u000d\u000a      the test pulse spectrum). He designed a phase-matching arrangement that\u000d\u000a      enabled the spectral shearing to be done in a single step with one\u000d\u000a      crystal, without needing the chirped signal [1]. The key concept,\u000d\u000a      group-velocity matching, was also shown theoretically to be very generally\u000d\u000a      applicable to all nonlinear optical processes [2]. Group-velocity matching\u000d\u000a      eliminated the need for the chirped pulse and therefore the optics that\u000d\u000a      produced it, including a bulky and inefficient pulse stretcher [3,4].\u000d\u000a    In SPIDER, the crystal length was limited by the chirped signal, which\u000d\u000a      travelled through the crystal at a different speed to the other two pulses\u000d\u000a      and thus short crystals were used to minimise blurring in the spectral\u000d\u000a      shear. By removing the need for the chirped signal, all pulses travel with\u000d\u000a      the same velocity in a single crystal. Walmsley realised he could then use\u000d\u000a      a longer crystal to perform the sum frequency generation, which would\u000d\u000a      result in a dramatic increase in frequency conversion efficiency, and thus\u000d\u000a      improve the sensitivity of the device. The long crystal (LX) method had a\u000d\u000a      further advantage that the longer, thicker crystals were more robust and\u000d\u000a      cheaper.\u000d\u000a    The research was led in Oxford by Professor Ian Walmsley (2001 - present)\u000d\u000a      with Gorza (postdoctoral researcher 2005 - 2007), Wasylczyk (postdoctoral\u000d\u000a      researcher 2006 - 2007) and research students Kosik-Williams and Radunsky.\u000d\u000a    The improvements from the Oxford research described in [2], [3] and [4]\u000d\u000a      culminated in a new technique, named ARAIGNEE, which was patented in the\u000d\u000a      US (US7599067, filed 2006, granted 2009) and in the EU (EP1886107, filed\u000d\u000a      2006, granted 2011).

Professor\u000d\u000a      Peter Read (appointed 1991) and his group at the University of Oxford\u000d\u000a      adapted numerical circulation models, originally developed for the Earth's\u000d\u000a      atmosphere, for use in studies of the Mars climate system. Initial studies\u000d\u000a      focused on investigating the role of surface topography on the atmospheric\u000d\u000a      circulation, including the identification of `Western boundary currents'\u000d\u000a      (WBCs), which are intensifications of north-south flow adjacent to an\u000d\u000a      eastward-facing meridional boundary. Although most familiar in the oceans,\u000d\u000a      where the Gulf Stream is the best known example, WBCs also occur in the\u000d\u000a      Earth's troposphere in the form of an intense jet stream, such as the one\u000d\u000a      associated with the Indian monsoon producing a seasonal jet close to the\u000d\u000a      Ethiopian Highlands.\u000d\u000a    In 1994, Professor Peter Read's group identified WBCs for the first time\u000d\u000a      in numerical simulations of the atmosphere of Mars [1,2], and demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that features of WBCs were consistent with observational evidence. The\u000d\u000a      intensity of WBCs is dependent on surface drag, and frictional forces were\u000d\u000a      shown to dominate the WBC's behaviour. Slope winds were found to have a\u000d\u000a      profound effect on WBC structure, especially where they have a component\u000d\u000a      parallel to the jet. In these cases, slope winds can cancel out or\u000d\u000a      reinforce WBCs, depending on their direction. Read determined that\u000d\u000a      enhanced low-level winds associated with WBCs are an important mechanism\u000d\u000a      in the generation of the dust storms on Mars and the transport of dust and\u000d\u000a      water vapour across the planet.\u000d\u000a    With this new insight, the Oxford team went on to collaborate with\u000d\u000a      Laboratoire de M&#233;t&#233;orologie Dynamique du CNRS (LMD) in Paris to develop\u000d\u000a      comprehensive climate and circulation models of Mars [3,4] and to publish\u000d\u000a      a database of statistics of global Mars climate and variations [5]. The\u000d\u000a      Oxford team primarily worked on the atmospheric dynamics, while LMD worked\u000d\u000a      primarily on improving the representation of physical processes (e.g.\u000d\u000a      radiative transfer, boundary layer turbulence) in the combined model.

In 2010, the best such instruments used differential\u000a      interferometry for high accuracy displacement measurements, necessitating\u000a      either continuous observation of a single target, or the use of much lower\u000a      accuracy absolute distance meters. The AMULET project broke these\u000a      limitations, by equipping a prototype laser tracer with dynamic FSI to\u000a      perform absolute distance measurements with accuracy comparable to\u000a      that of differential interferometry and with other user benefits as\u000a      described below. The National Physical Laboratory, as one of the partners\u000a      in the project, tested the dynamic FSI technology and confirmed\u000a      sub-part-per-million accuracy at up to a 20 metre range [A].\u000a    Isis Innovation, the University of Oxford's technology transfer office,\u000a      filed two patents [4] for the FSI system in July 2011, which were licensed\u000a      to ETALON-AG in 2012. ETALON identified the FSI technology as, \"a\u000a        pioneering solution to the precision measurement of absolute length\"\u000a      [B].\u000a    New capabilities in absolute distance metrology\u000a    The dynamic FSI approach allowed the tracer to be tolerant to beam breaks\u000a      and to automatically switch targets. ETALON describe some of the\u000a      advantages of dynamic FSI being that it allows traceable measurements with\u000a      a \"10,000 times faster time resolution and 20 times higher accuracy\"\u000a      than previous absolute distance systems; that it \"recovers gracefully\"\u000a      from beam breaks and does not require frequent calibration.\u000a    Dynamic FSI systems can also be scaled up to make many hundreds of\u000a      measurements for only a small fractional increase in cost compared to the\u000a      basic system, simply by using multiple interferometers whose components\u000a      are cheap. ETALON have identified that together with being \"cheaper to\u000a        manufacture than previous technologies\", this makes their \"Absolute\u000a      Multiline&#8482;\" range of FSI products \"relevant and accessible to a much\u000a        wider range of purchasers\" [B]. ETALON describe their market areas\u000a      as \"the calibration, monitoring and accuracy enhancement of machine\u000a        tools and measuring machines\", with customers from the mechanical\u000a      engineering, metrology, automotive and aerospace industries, as well as\u000a      from research sectors.\u000a    New product brought to market\u000a    The Absolute Multiline&#8482; system launched in November 2012 [B] became\u000a      ETALON's primary FSI-based product. It is a general purpose, absolute\u000a      distance interferometer system marketed as having up to 100 measurement\u000a      channels and distances between the sensors and system electronics of up to\u000a      several kilometres. ETALON's marketing material describes another\u000a      advantage of the system as being that, \"The sensor signals are not\u000a        affected by electromagnetically noisy environments; therefore the\u000a        placing of sensors in e.g. energy chains is possible without the\u000a        degradation of performance\" [C]. The list price of the basic product\u000a      ([text removed for publication]) with software is in excess of [text\u000a      removed for publication].\u000a    ETALON's development of the FSI system into a product was accelerated by\u000a      research and consultancy contracts undertaken by Reichold and his team at\u000a      Oxford, which ETALON identify as \"drawing directly on knowledge and\u000a        experience from their research\" [B]. ETALON-AG secured funding from\u000a      the Lower Saxony Development Bank, NBank, to build a prototype Absolute\u000a      Multiline&#8482; system for marketing and user training purposes. In total,\u000a      ETALON have invested [text removed for publication] in developing and\u000a      marketing the Multiline system. This included not only manufacturing the\u000a      prototype but also demonstrating it at trade shows in Chester, Stuttgart\u000a      and San Diego. They have stated that they wish to \"make Multiline one\u000a        of the cornerstones of our business\".\u000a    The first of these systems, with 24 channels, was built at Oxford and\u000a      later repackaged by ETALON. This system was sold to the Metrology and\u000a      Quality Management group at RWTH Aachen, and installed and commissioned in\u000a      June 2013. The group leader at Aachen stated that the system \"significantly\u000a        enlarged\" their capabilities in the field of large volume metrology\u000a      and that they were \"not currently aware of any other system on the\u000a        market that [Aachen] could have purchased to achieve the same\u000a        performance\". Their most challenging application at July 2013 had\u000a      successfully achieved ten simultaneous absolute distance measurements over\u000a      distances up to 6m [D]. By July 2013, a second sale had been agreed to the\u000a      metrology group at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the USA.\u000a    New budgeted programme and employees at the National Physical\u000a        Laboratory\u000a    NPL is the UK's national measurement institute, operated commercially\u000a      under contract to the National Measurement Office. As a direct result of\u000a      their participation in the AMULET project, NPL decided to establish their\u000a      own FSI group including a research programme valued at around &#163;700,000\u000a      [A]. By July 2013 this included appointing two new, full-time members of\u000a      staff, one of whom was Dr Warden, who left the Oxford group to take up\u000a      that post. As another benefit, NPL realise licence revenue from any sales\u000a      of Absolute Multiline&#8482; and thus receive financial benefit from the systems\u000a      sold by ETALON.\u000a    Influence on policy via technology roadmaps\u000a    One of the themes within NPL's future vision, `Metrology for the 2020s'\u000a      (published in March 2012), is `embedded and ubiquitous measurement':\u000a      within this theme, laser interferometry systems for accurate and traceable\u000a      metrology were identified as having an important contribution to future\u000a      processing and production [E].

Two key projects laid\u000a      the foundations for the impact described here.\u000a    ATLAS silicon inner tracking detector (R&amp;D 1991-2002;\u000a      installation 2003-07):\u000a      To monitor the positions of the many components of this detector for the\u000a      Large Hadron Collider, a metrology system was required that was of\u000a      sub-micron accuracy, very small, low mass, passive, radiation-hard, able\u000a      to monitor hundreds of positions inexpensively and capable of remote\u000a      operation. The Oxford ATLAS group proposed [1], developed, constructed and\u000a      installed [2] a Frequency Scanning Interferometry (FSI) system consisting\u000a      of a pair of lasers that drive a `tree' of optical splitters each output\u000a      of which feeds an interferometer, yielding an extremely scalable system.\u000a      Using the two lasers alternately compensated for an error from drift\u000a      during each measurement. Essential advances were a highly efficient\u000a      data-acquisition system, a new way of manufacturing reflectors, and\u000a      identifying a combination of suitable technologies for fibre splitters. In\u000a      addition, given the operating environment, radiation-hard materials and\u000a      fibres had to be identified and tested.\u000a    Linear Collider Alignment and Survey (LiCAS, 2002-9):\u000a      This project developed a robotic survey system (RTRS) for the 35km tunnel\u000a      of a future linear collider (ILC). Dr Armin Reichold proposed a short\u000a      train of measurement cars that can rapidly and automatically measure a\u000a      network of reference position markers. The design objective was an\u000a      accuracy of order 200 microns in the tunnel's straightness over 600\u000a      metres. A key step was the development by Reichold and his student John\u000a      Green of a new data analysis technique based on least-squares spectral\u000a      analysis (Lomb Periodograms) of the interferometer intensity data over\u000a      time allowing simultaneous observation of multiple reflectors in a single\u000a      interferometer. Other major achievements from this research were the\u000a      ability to both feed light and read it out through a single fibre for the\u000a      first time; the simultaneous presence of light from both lasers in the\u000a      interferometers, eliminating the drift error completely; and collimation\u000a      of the beam without generation of secondary reflection for long\u000a      measurements up to 20 metres.\u000a    Having carried out market surveys to find photo diodes, lasers, and\u000a      collimators with the required performance, the Oxford team realised that\u000a      the system could be extended to longer distances and made significantly\u000a      cheaper by adopting existing commercial telecommunications hardware. This\u000a      meant switching to wavelengths around 1550nm and using InGaAs detectors.\u000a      To adopt this approach, Reichold and his team developed compatible\u000a      amplifiers with sufficiently low noise and high bandwidth and determined\u000a      what specification of detector would be effective. The project culminated\u000a      in a system that amplified a telecoms-class laser to operate 32 FSI\u000a      interferometers simultaneously, which was deployed and tested in the RTRS\u000a      at the DESY laboratory in Hamburg [2]. This project was cut short after\u000a      STFC's withdrawal from the ILC in 2007 but, motivated by the need for\u000a      stable magnet positions in future linear colliders, the method was refined\u000a      further, ultimately reaching nanometre precision interferometry for\u000a      distances up to 10 metres.\u000a    Following these two particle and accelerator physics projects, the Advanced\u000a        Metrology Using Laser Tracers project (AMULET, 2010-13), led by\u000a      Reichold, then developed a new technique called dynamic FSI to give\u000a      measurements that were both absolute and traceable [4,5], both essential\u000a      attributes for industrial applications. The project was funded by EPSRC\u000a      and two partners: the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and the company\u000a      ETALON-AG. A major advance was to use the molecular absorption frequencies\u000a      in a gas cell as the primary traceable frequency standard, avoiding the\u000a      cumbersome evacuated and thermally stabilised reference interferometers\u000a      adopted in conventional approaches.\u000a    Other achievements by Reichold's group included\u000a    \u000a      A method to measure distances at every data point taken during a laser\u000a        scan, enabling repeat rates up to the sampling rate of the\u000a        analogue-digital converter (up to 2.77MHz for the main project and up to\u000a        50MHz for a prototype).\u000a      Creation and evaluation of robust fibre-based reference\u000a        interferometers that represent a temporary length standard and remain\u000a        stable over the duration of an FSI scan (seconds); these massively\u000a        decreased the overall size and cost of the system.\u000a      Improvement of the vibration and drift tolerance of FSI.\u000a      Optimisation of FSI system costs, in particular for the FSI lasers and\u000a        reference interferometers.\u000a      Exploitation of the new capability of a single FSI interferometer to\u000a        observe several distances simultaneously for improved multidimensional\u000a        coordinate metrology.\u000a    \u000a    Participating researchers from the University of Oxford included\u000a      lecturers Richard Nickerson (1989-present), Armin Reichold (1998-present)\u000a      and David Urner (2004-10); PDRAs Steve Gibson (2007-10) and John Dale\u000a      (2010-2013), both previously students, Paul Coe (2009-10), Patrick\u000a      Brockill (2008-9 and 2011-13), and Grzegorz Grzelak (2003-8); and students\u000a      John Green (2004-8), Matthew Warden (2006-12) and Andrew Lancaster\u000a      (2010-present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19673","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Oxford research team used the new QPLIF technique to test, in Oxford,\u000d\u000a      a prototype single\u000d\u000a      cylinder engine for JLR's AJ133 V8 engine.

Professor\u000a      Gregg's group also included postdoctoral research assistants W. Allen\u000a      (student 1995-1999 then PDRA 1999-01) and M. Thornton (PDRA 1999-2001) and\u000a      drew on the skills of R. Bendall, head of the Clarendon workshops in\u000a      Oxford Physics.\u000a    This research was in the field of Spintronics &#8212; specifically the Giant\u000a      Magnetoresistive (GMR) behaviour of thin magnetic sandwiches, thin\u000a      granular magnetic films and magnetic tunnel junctions &#8212; and the magnetic\u000a      dynamics of nanoscale magnetic elements. A question arose as to the\u000a      mechanism that underlies the electrical resistance of a ferromagnetic\u000a      domain wall. This was a subject of controversy in the 1960's and two\u000a      competing models were advanced to explain the effect. In 1996, the Oxford\u000a      Spintronics group and their York and Strasbourg collaborators developed a\u000a      new model based on the same spin-dependent scattering that causes GMR. To\u000a      test these models rigorously through experiments, the global magnetic\u000a      switching properties of thin film samples first had to be characterised.\u000a      However, existing magnetometer devices were neither fast nor sensitive\u000a      enough for these systems and a SQUID would have been impractical (e.g.\u000a      requiring cryogenic conditions) and overcomplicated. In order to address\u000a      this problem, Prof Gregg's group in Oxford developed a novel, highly\u000a      sensitive radiofrequency circuit that responded to changes in each of the\u000a      two components of magnetic susceptibility of the films as they switched.\u000a      This circuit consisted of a resonant, positive feedback system that was\u000a      designed, refined and constructed in Oxford Physics and drew directly on\u000a      Prof Gregg's expertise in the properties and behaviour of entire analogue\u000a      electronic circuits.\u000a    With this new magnetometer, custom samples were validated quickly,\u000a      effectively and without risk of damaging them, so they could be further\u000a      investigated with confidence. As a result, quantitative agreement of the\u000a      model with experiment was successfully demonstrated [1] and this is now\u000a      the accepted model of domain-wall resistance. The high sensitivity of this\u000a      circuit enabled a number of other applications within spintronics\u000a      research, including for characterisation of granular GMR films during\u000a      annealing in the growth chamber and for fast characterisation of the phase\u000a      diagram of colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) material [2].\u000a    However, the very precautions necessary to shield these measurements from\u000a      external influences suggested to Professor Gregg the potential to adapt\u000a      the circuit to make a mechanical sensor that could detect the presence and\u000a      motion of a moving object. The object could be magnetic, metallic or\u000a      insulating, depending on the precise configuration of the circuit and\u000a      whether spintronic material was incorporated, and crucially would not need\u000a      to be tagged with additional components.\u000a    This approach was developed within an EC network project, HotSEAMS,\u000a      coordinated by Professor Gregg. The new mechanical sensor device was\u000a      reported at the Network's mid-term meeting in 1998, at which the challenge\u000a      was set to demonstrate it by carrying out a practical function. A\u000a      demonstrator was therefore produced by the Oxford group that successfully\u000a      applied the device to control the ignition-timing function on a\u000a      second-hand 5 litre Mercedes V8 M117 engine. This showed that the new\u000a      sensor gave rise to less ignition skipping than the standard Bosch\u000a      variable-reluctance sensor, which was known to be prone to this problem at\u000a      low speed.\u000a    In 2001, Isis Innovation (the University of Oxford's technology transfer\u000a      office), conscious of the wide range of applications of the device [3],\u000a      filed a set of patents describing the sensor with Professor Gregg as sole\u000a      inventor. These patents were granted in 2006 in the EU, US and Japan [4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19878","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Tetrahertz radiation encompasses frequencies invisible to the naked eye\u000d\u000a      in the electromagnetic spectrum, lying between microwaves and the\u000d\u000a      infrared.

A total of 70 of these\u000d\u000a      systems have been sold to date, half within the impact period at a cost of\u000d\u000a      approximately $300k each. These have been supplied to laboratories in\u000d\u000a      Europe, North America and the Far East. Roughly half of these are\u000d\u000a      industrial laboratories.

Professor\u000d\u000a      Sir Michael Pepper, co-founder of TeraView and Professor at the Department\u000d\u000a      throughout the period until 2008, led the Semiconductor Physics Group and\u000d\u000a      was supported by Dr E H Linfield (Research Associate from 1991, Assistant\u000d\u000a      Director of Research 1997 to 2004) and Dr A G Davies (Research Fellow 1995\u000d\u000a      to 2002) working on Terahertz device design and testing with Dr H E Beere\u000d\u000a      (Research Associate from 1999, Senior Research Associate from 2004)\u000d\u000a      working on MBE growth of materials for devices.\u000d\u000a    In 2001 concepts and simulation of terahertz generation in GaAs devices\u000d\u000a      irradiated with very short laser pulses were developed at the Cavendish\u000d\u000a      Laboratory [1]. This work led to the development of the MBE growth of\u000d\u000a      suitable GaAs and the fabrication of devices for broadband sources and\u000d\u000a      detectors of terahertz radiation [2]. This research was undertaken\u000d\u000a      entirely at the Cavendish Laboratory and published in 2003.\u000d\u000a    The results of the research stimulated collaboration with TeraView.\u000d\u000a      Low-temperature MBE growth of GaAs and sample annealing were carried out\u000d\u000a      in the Department of Physics and carrier lifetime measurements were\u000d\u000a      carried out at TeraView. This study allowed the development of GaAs with\u000d\u000a      very short carrier lifetimes in 2003 [3]. This material was then used in\u000d\u000a      devices to generate and detect terahertz radiation, again in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with TeraView in 2004 [4].\u000d\u000a    The Semiconductor Physics Group's research in conjunction with TeraView\u000d\u000a      resulted in the development of broadband terahertz sources and detectors\u000d\u000a      based on photoconductive effects. The time-resolved nature of these\u000d\u000a      devices enabled the TeraView imaging systems to be developed. This\u000d\u000a      patented terahertz technology created spectroscopic information and 3D\u000d\u000a      image maps with unique spectroscopic signatures not found at other\u000d\u000a      wavelengths. It thus resolved many of the questions left unanswered by\u000d\u000a      complementary techniques, such as optical imaging, Raman and infrared\u000d\u000a      spectroscopy.\u000d\u000a    Using technology of this type, in a collaboration between the Cavendish\u000d\u000a      Laboratory and TeraView, investigations were undertaken into the imaging\u000d\u000a      of skin cancer in 2002 [5], and the imaging of teeth as well as drug\u000d\u000a      analysis [6] in 2003. This research enabled the development of\u000d\u000a      applications for THz imaging systems of interest to the medical profession\u000d\u000a      as well as drug companies.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21796","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    It is widely accepted that computation and simulation is a driver of\u000d\u000a      economic growth. The most\u000d\u000a      important requirement for industrial adoption of any simulation method is\u000d\u000a      that the method must be\u000d\u000a      accurate enough to be `useful', essentially that it can be relied on when\u000d\u000a      making decisions. This has\u000d\u000a      always been the overriding factor in, leading provider of atomistic\u000d\u000a      simulation software, Accelrys'\u000d\u000a      choice of codes to support within its modelling environment as it has been\u000d\u000a      determined to maintain\u000d\u000a      its position at the `high quality' end of atomistic simulations. CASTEP\u000d\u000a      has had significant impact\u000d\u000a      because it predicts physical properties to an accuracy of a few percent\u000d\u000a      using no adjustable\u000d\u000a      parameters and requiring no prior information about the system, thus\u000d\u000a      clearly fulfilling industry and\u000d\u000a      Accelrys' requirements for simulation codes. Accelrys' own success can\u000d\u000a      also be attributed to the\u000d\u000a      ease of use of its products. For instance, it was the first company to\u000d\u000a      provide access to materials\u000d\u000a      simulation methodologies through a graphical user interface. CASTEP is\u000d\u000a      completely aligned with\u000d\u000a      this philosophy, being the first quantum mechanical materials simulation\u000d\u000a      code that truly abstracted\u000d\u000a      all the complexity out of the calculations to make the methodology highly\u000d\u000a      accessible. Given the\u000d\u000a      combination of accuracy, predictive capability and ease of use that CASTEP\u000d\u000a      provides, the final\u000d\u000a      factor determining the level of industrial use, as with any simulation\u000d\u000a      method, depends on its cost\u000d\u000a      effectiveness compared to other methods for obtaining the same\u000d\u000a      information. Continuing research\u000d\u000a      has significantly decreased the computational costs of CASTEP calculations\u000d\u000a      over and above that\u000d\u000a      provided by Moore's Law, thus increasing the number of tasks that are most\u000d\u000a      effectively assigned to\u000d\u000a      CASTEP. Furthermore, the continuing decrease in the cost of computation\u000d\u000a      means that even if a\u000d\u000a      simulation method is not cost effective at a particular time it is likely\u000d\u000a      to become so at some time in\u000d\u000a      the future.\u000d\u000a    Quantum mechanical simulations using CASTEP have provided the ability to\u000d\u000a      perform `virtual'\u000d\u000a      experiments on materials. However, there are many different types of\u000d\u000a      materials and a vast range of\u000d\u000a      physical, chemical and materials properties of interest involving a wide\u000d\u000a      range of lengthscales and\u000d\u000a      timescales. Therefore, simulation is not yet capable of replacing\u000d\u000a      experiment to determine all\u000d\u000a      materials properties of interest. Accelrys stresses just how much CASTEP\u000d\u000a      offers in solving these\u000d\u000a      classes of problems, by advertising the software suite as able to `simulate\u000d\u000a        the properties of solids,\u000d\u000a        interfaces, and surfaces for a wide range of materials classes,\u000d\u000a        including ceramics, semiconductors,\u000d\u000a        and metals, with this premier density functional theory (DFT) quantum\u000d\u000a        mechanical code'. Such\u000d\u000a      simulations enable customers to gain information about impurities in\u000d\u000a      semiconductors, optical\u000d\u000a      properties of materials, chemical reactions in catalysts, surface and bulk\u000d\u000a      diffusion, refine atomic\u000d\u000a      structures and generate the `experimental' spectra associated with these\u000d\u000a      structures.\u000d\u000a    The separate package CASTEP-NMR has provided is capable of generating the\u000d\u000a      NMR spectrum\u000d\u000a      associated with a model structure and thus the combination of experiment\u000d\u000a      and CASTEP-NMR\u000d\u000a      allows unambiguous determination of structures of crystals. This is\u000d\u000a      particularly important in the\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical sector where a drug patent has to not only specify the drug\u000d\u000a      molecule but also the\u000d\u000a      crystal structure (the particular crystal polymorph) of the drug in the\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical product.\u000d\u000a      CASTEP-NMR helps to identify the actual polymorph and, importantly,\u000d\u000a      deviations in experimental\u000d\u000a      data from that predicted. CASTEP-NMR is also used to identify low levels\u000d\u000a      of other polymorphs in\u000d\u000a      the product. If these other polymorphs are not patented then competitors\u000d\u000a      may circumvent the\u000d\u000a      patent by marketing the drug in the form of the non-patented polymorph.\u000d\u000a    The greatest impact of quantum mechanical simulations is often when they\u000d\u000a      are used alongside\u000d\u000a      experiment, as in the pharmaceuticals example above. For competitive\u000d\u000a      reasons companies tend to\u000d\u000a      be very secretive about their detailed use of simulation codes.\u000d\u000a      Illustrative examples of the\u000d\u000a      application of materials simulation approaches can be found in the IDC\u000d\u000a      report \"Modeling and\u000d\u000a        Simulation: The Return on Investment in Materials Science,\" and the\u000d\u000a      Goldbeck Consulting report\u000d\u000a      \"Economic Impact of Molecular Modelling\". These reports mention\u000d\u000a      many of the societal and\u000d\u000a      economic benefits clearly provided by CASTEP including (i) efficiency:\u000d\u000a      many different properties of\u000d\u000a      many different classes of materials can be determined using a single piece\u000d\u000a      of `apparatus', namely\u000d\u000a      a software package and computer; (ii) the broader exploration of materials\u000d\u000a      solution space possible\u000d\u000a      once simulation becomes significantly cheaper than experiment; (iii)\u000d\u000a      projects which had stalled\u000d\u000a      were restarted with information obtained from simulation and (iv) reduced\u000d\u000a      time to market.\u000d\u000a    That CASTEP has proved to be exceedingly useful to industry is reflected\u000d\u000a      in its use by more than\u000d\u000a      800 companies and its on-going sales in excess of &#163;1million every year\u000d\u000a      since 1998, with\u000d\u000a      cumulative worldwide sales now over $30million, demonstrating the value\u000d\u000a      placed by commercial\u000d\u000a      clients on access to the software.

With 830 unique customers, many of whom are household names\u000d\u000a      (Boeing, Toyota, GM\u000d\u000a      and DuPont for instance), the ability to make valuable predictions about\u000d\u000a      new materials being used\u000d\u000a      in new now ways offers huge scope to diverse industries to develop their\u000d\u000a      product portfolio, or have\u000d\u000a      confidence in the use of the materials in new applications. Product\u000d\u000a      innovation has been enhanced\u000d\u000a      very substantially by CASTEP's use.\u000d\u000a    There are a number of published patents for materials or processes which\u000d\u000a      have been designed\u000d\u000a      partially based on CASTEP calculations.

Total energy\u000d\u000a      pseduopotential calculations had been applied to simple systems in the\u000d\u000a      early 1980s but were\u000d\u000a      restricted to small numbers of atoms from only a small part of the\u000d\u000a      periodic table. Progress from the\u000d\u000a      mid-1980s began to increase the capability of the calculations but (i)\u000d\u000a      only one or two chemists in\u000d\u000a      the world believed in density functional theory, (ii) there were concerns\u000d\u000a      about the applicability of\u000d\u000a      pseudopotentials to transition elements and (iii) it was not clear that\u000d\u000a      the method could address\u000d\u000a      complex problems. In 1991, Professor Payne (Department of Physics,\u000d\u000a      University of Cambridge\u000d\u000a      Assistant Lecturer from 1991, Professor from 2000), in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh Parallel\u000d\u000a      Computer Centre, ported his total energy pseudopotential code to parallel\u000d\u000a      computers. Subsequent\u000d\u000a      research exploited the increased computational performance of these\u000d\u000a      systems and, particularly,\u000d\u000a      the large amount of memory calculations that could be performed for larger\u000d\u000a      and more complex\u000d\u000a      systems. Thus, the concerns about the scope and capability of the total\u000d\u000a      energy pseudopotential\u000d\u000a      technique could be directly challenged through a series of innovative\u000d\u000a      scientific applications. These\u000d\u000a      applications not only proved that the criticisms of the total energy\u000d\u000a      pseudopotential techniques were\u000d\u000a      unfounded but also revealed the enormous scope of this approach. Amongst\u000d\u000a      many other\u000d\u000a      applications, these pioneering applications showed for the first time the\u000d\u000a      capability of the total\u000d\u000a      energy pseudopotential method to:\u000d\u000a    perform dynamical simulations of chemical reactions [1];\u000d\u000a      determine absorption energies of molecules on transition metal surfaces\u000d\u000a      [2];\u000d\u000a      model chemical reactions in extended solid state catalysts [3];\u000d\u000a      directly simulate experimental probes thus making a direct link between\u000d\u000a      experimental\u000d\u000a      measurements and underlying atomic structure [4].\u000d\u000a    By 2000 the model for developing CASTEP through a combination of academic\u000d\u000a      and industrial\u000d\u000a      inputs (some coming from companies other than Accelrys) was failing. Like\u000d\u000a      so many codes it had\u000d\u000a      become bloated and undevelopable. Between 2000 and 2003, under a major\u000d\u000a      research project, the\u000d\u000a      code was completely re-engineered from scratch by the CASTEP Developers\u000d\u000a      Group (CDG), with\u000d\u000a      most the members of CDG being based in the Department of Physics in the\u000d\u000a      University of\u000d\u000a      Cambridge during this time (see details below). The code re-engineering\u000d\u000a      made no re-use of\u000d\u000a      existing code and was carried out using modern software engineering\u000d\u000a      techniques to provide a\u000d\u000a      robust, efficient, and portable code [5]. The aim of this research project\u000d\u000a      was to provide a solid\u000d\u000a      platform for development of new capabilities and functionalities for the\u000d\u000a      total energy pseudopotential\u000d\u000a      method. One example of this was the development of a suite of Nuclear\u000d\u000a      Magnetic Resonance\u000d\u000a      capabilities and the use of this to relate experimental NMR spectra to the\u000d\u000a      underlying atomic\u000d\u000a      structure &#8212; something not possible using experiment alone [6]. This\u000d\u000a      research led to the\u000d\u000a      development of an additional module CASTEP-NMR which is sold by Accelrys\u000d\u000a      alongside the\u000d\u000a      CASTEP package for those who want this additional capability.\u000d\u000a    Cambridge has provided the intellectual leadership for the creation and\u000d\u000a      development of CASTEP.\u000d\u000a      Throughout the relevant period the vast majority of the research\u000d\u000a      underpinning CASTEP code\u000d\u000a      development, including the key central modules, was done in Cambridge by a\u000d\u000a      research group led\u000d\u000a      by Professor Payne. Smaller contributions came from the UK Car-Parrinello\u000d\u000a      consortium (UKCP),\u000d\u000a      which also performed many applications of the code. Of the CDG, the\u000d\u000a      following worked at the\u000d\u000a      University of Cambridge Department of Physics as researchers\/fellows\u000d\u000a      during the census period\u000d\u000a      (dates in brackets): Dr. Matt Segall (1997-2000, 2002-2007), Professor\u000d\u000a      Chris Pickard (2000-2006),\u000d\u000a      Dr. Matt Probert (1996-2000), Dr. Phil Hasnip (1996-2000 in the Department\u000d\u000a      of Physics and then\u000d\u000a      2000-2005 in the Department of Materials), Dr. Jonathan Yates (2006-8).\u000d\u000a      Members of the CDG not\u000d\u000a      based in Cambridge: Professor Stewart Clark, University of Durham, Dr.\u000d\u000a      Keith Refson, STFC\u000d\u000a      Rutherford Appleton Technology Campus.

We have\u000a      stimulated public interest in science and engineering and inspired\u000a      thousands of schoolchildren by including our research in their education\u000a      programmes. We achieve this impact through a strategic approach to\u000a      developing a high national and international media profile combined with a\u000a      purpose-built facility at Jodrell Bank to welcome visitors and engage them\u000a      directly with the actual research going on at the site. This engagement\u000a      with live science and active researchers at a working observatory is a key\u000a      element in our delivering impact. Another key element of our approach is\u000a      that the engagement programme is directed by designated members of staff &#8212;\u000a      currently Prof. Tim O'Brien (1999-date; Associate Director Jodrell Bank\u000a      Observatory) and Dr Teresa Anderson (2006-date; Director of Jodrell Bank\u000a      Discovery Centre) and, until 2007, Prof. Ian Morison (retired 2010). Some\u000a      specific examples of this impact during 2008-13 are listed below.\u000a    The Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre : In April 2011 we opened a new\u000a      &#163;2.9M Discovery Centre (funded by external grants from the Regional\u000a      Development Agency and the European Regional Development Fund) replacing\u000a      remaining parts of the public science centre which had been on site since\u000a      the mid 1960's but reduced in size in 2003. The new Centre has a broad\u000a      remit of enhancing public engagement with our research combined with\u000a      providing out-of-classroom education aimed at inspiring the next\u000a      generation of scientists and engineers. From Jan 2008 to Jul 2013, 496,000\u000a      people visited the Centre. From 2008 until it closed for rebuilding in Sep\u000a      2010, numbers were around 70-80,000 per year, but since re-opening in 2011\u000a      annual visitor numbers have risen to 128,000 (Aug 2012-Jul 2013). (A)\u000a    Current exhibits highlight our research, including the work of the Lovell\u000a      Telescope, pulsars, e-MERLIN, the CMB, black holes, gravitational lensing,\u000a      the evolution of stars and the search for life. The latest exhibit on the\u000a      science &amp; technology of Big Telescopes (including the work of VLT and\u000a      ALMA, and plans for E-ELT and SKA) will open in Oct 2013. Our researchers\u000a      work closely with the Centre e.g. in daily \"Ask an Expert\" talks\/Q&amp;A\u000a      during school holidays (which have attracted 5,500 attendees from July\u000a      2011 to April 2013) and in public lectures such as the Lovell Lectures\u000a      (held every 2-3 months, each attracting sell-out audiences of around 125).\u000a      (A)\u000a    The Centre was awarded Tourism Attraction of the Year by Marketing\u000a      Cheshire in 2012 (B). Evidence of impact of our activities at the Centre\u000a      can be found in a consistent appetite for our events and exhibitions\u000a      throughout the REF period (note visitors paying for entrance provide a\u000a      current annual income of around &#163;600,000 which is ploughed back into the\u000a      Centre and its operations), audience growth at the new Centre (from 94,000\u000a      visitors in first full year 2011\/12 to 128,000 in 2012\/13), positive\u000a      feedback and repeat visits from schools and the general public. For\u000a      example, 82% of visitors rate the quality of the venue and the content of\u000a      the exhibition as good or very good; whilst in a Girls Night Out event\u000a      targeted at young women, 91% said they were more interested after the\u000a      event whilst 94% said they'd come again; quotes include \"My 12 year old\u000a      loved it, as did I\"; \"It was extremely exciting and when I go back to\u000a      school it will help me with my studying\". A national online survey carried\u000a      out by Harris International in 2008 showed that 54% of the UK population\u000a      recognise Jodrell Bank as a UK science facility &#8212; a `brand' recognition\u000a      unparalleled amongst active UK science centres and indicative of the\u000a      impact of our public engagement. Another Harris survey in 2012 found 76%\u000a      of our visitors are very likely or absolutely certain to recommend a visit\u000a      to friends (C).\u000a    Music &amp; Science &#8212; Live from Jodrell Bank : New audiences are\u000a      engaged with our research in innovative events such as the Live from\u000a      Jodrell Bank music\/science festivals. The first event in July 2011\u000a      attracted 5,000 people from the UK and beyond, in 2012 this increased to\u000a      12,000. In 2013 we held the event over two weekends in July and August.\u000a      The first on July 6\/7 attracted a total of about 12,000 attendees. Aimed\u000a      at reaching out to a different audience, postcode analysis of ticket\u000a      holders showed 65% of the attendees travelled further than 60 miles\u000a      (including some from overseas), whereas 94% of our usual visitors come\u000a      from within 60 miles. Alongside the Music Arena with the main stage we\u000a      also have a Science Arena which showcases Jodrell Bank research with\u000a      exhibitions and talks from our researchers, as well as others from the UK\u000a      community, including STFC, IoP, RCUK and the Wellcome Trust. Our research\u000a      is also delivered from the main stage between bands by Prof. O'Brien. This\u000a      includes descriptions of scientific results from use of the Jodrell\u000a      telescopes and, in 2012, a live video link to the telescope platform at\u000a      the VLT in Chile. For the 2013 event, although 68% of people had primarily\u000a      come to see the bands, 81% of people surveyed said they had learnt\u000a      something about science whilst 87% would definitely visit Jodrell Bank\u000a      again (D).\u000a    Live From Jodrell Bank 2011 was awarded Best Outdoor Event at the\u000a      national Event Awards in 2012; the 2012 event received an award for\u000a      `Extreme Creativity' from a panel of industry judges at the 2012 UK\u000a      Festival Awards for its extra activity of integrating science into the\u000a      music event (E).\u000a    Job creation &amp; economic impact of tourism : As of July 2013,\u000a      26 jobs have been directly created in the new Discovery Centre (6 of them\u000a      specifically for science engagement &amp; education), plus 7 have been\u000a      safeguarded and more will follow both directly and indirectly. As part of\u000a      the funding process, the Regional Development Agency commissioned an\u000a      assessment from EKOS (economic &amp; social development consultants) which\u000a      found the Centre is likely to provide an additional &#163;27M economic impact\u000a      to the region over the decade from opening in 2011 i.e. ~&#163;6M over the REF\u000a      period (F). Although no similar analyses exist, the economic impact of\u000a      visitors during 2008-11 will also have been significant.\u000a    Education &amp; inspiration : During the REF period 2008-2013,\u000a      43,000 pupils have visited Jodrell Bank as part of school groups, taking\u000a      part in workshops relating to our research and targeted at the curriculum.\u000a      The new programme, launched in Sep 2012, attracted 13,000 pupils in its\u000a      first year and also includes teacher-training and short courses for\u000a      adults. 97% of teachers rate these sessions as either good or excellent.\u000a      We also regularly deliver talks and workshops in schools; targeting\u000a      disadvantaged schools in particular. For example, we reached around 1500\u000a      Cumbrian pupils in an outreach event in 2010 alongside one of our research\u000a      conferences (A).\u000a    Media impact : Jodrell Bank research has attracted the attention\u000a      of the media for many years stimulated in part by our active publicity\u000a      programme. From 2008, we have produced more than 80 press releases and\u000a      news items (available on our website) and, from monthly Google News\u000a      searches, there were over 1,500 mentions of Jodrell Bank in print and web\u000a      news stories (G).\u000a    TV producers in particular have been attracted to our work, resulting in\u000a      our scientists and facilities appearing many times in a wide range of\u000a      programmes. The most significant recent example is the incredibly\u000a      successful BBC2 \"Stargazing Live\" series broadcast from\u000a      Jodrell Bank in Jan 2011, 2012 and 2013.The programme typically attracts\u000a      over 3 million viewers on each night of 3 consecutive nights, remarkable\u000a      for a science subject. In 2012, it was the most viewed programme on BBC\u000a      Two, Channel 4 or Channel 5 during the week of transmission and its\u000a      audience share was 53% higher than the timeslot average (H). The programme\u000a      always features our research and technology (e.g. pulsars, starburst\u000a      galaxies, radio jets, masers, SETI, e-MERLIN and SKA). The impact has been\u000a      clear: many positive reviews; astronomy equipment was reported as selling\u000a      out in major retailers; a record-breaking 2.3 million downloads of the BBC\u000a      Stargazing Guide; in 2011, 3,800 viewer photos and 5,000 questions were\u000a      submitted; the website had 450,000 views; 13,000 people took part in\u000a      interactive chat; 40,000 people attended 330 linked events nationwide; and\u000a      astronomy societies reported significant boosts in membership and website\u000a      traffic (H).\u000a    Podcast : A popular feature of our outreach programme is \"The\u000a      Jodcast\", a twice-monthly podcast which has been produced since Jan 2006\u000a      by a team primarily composed of research students. The show features news,\u000a      interviews with our researchers and others, and audience Q&amp;A . There\u000a      have been more than 170 episodes and special programmes, including reports\u000a      from National Astronomy Meetings and occasional video episodes (e.g.\u000a      featuring e-MERLIN and LOFAR). The shows are regularly downloaded by over\u000a      4,000 listeners (this is a lower limit as it does not include syndicated\u000a      outlets such as astronomy.fm). When surveyed in 2010, 95% of 195\u000a      respondents said they would recommend it to others, 85% said that it had\u000a      increased their interest in astronomy, whilst 94% said they had learnt\u000a      something worthwhile. Quotes include \"The interviews are my favourite part\u000a      because you talk to an expert at length rather than editing them down to\u000a      short sound bites\"; \"You always inspire and intrigue\". (I).\u000a    World Heritage Site : In 2011, Jodrell Bank Observatory was added\u000a      to the UK Tentative List for World Heritage Site status demonstrating a\u000a      major societal impact of our research. The panel recognised that the site\u000a      is \"impressive tangible evidence of a major modern scientific development\u000a      which has greatly enlarged human understanding of the Universe\" (J).\u000a    Conclusion : Our aim with the programme of public engagement from\u000a      Jodrell Bank is to harness the strong public interest in curiosity-driven\u000a      research by directly engaging them with scientific research at a major UK\u000a      facility, providing a legacy for decades by inspiring a wide audience\u000a      including the scientists and engineers of the future.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    For decades Jodrell Bank has been a world-leader in both radio astronomy\u000a      research and public engagement with science. The Lovell Telescope in\u000a      particular, whilst still remaining one of the world's foremost active\u000a      research instruments, has become an icon for UK science and engineering.\u000a      In this case study we show how Jodrell Bank research has had a significant\u000a      impact on society, culture and creativity, including economic impacts of\u000a      tourism, educational impacts from engagement with schools, and cultural\u000a      and creative impacts in television, music and the arts.

The\u000a      opportunities span an incredibly broad range of applications, including\u000a      printed electronics, new transistors, super capacitors, transparent\u000a      conductors, biomedical sensors, automotive batteries, and composites and\u000a      coatings with enhanced mechanical and electrical performance. Companies\u000a      have moved rapidly to exploit this potential, with significant investment\u000a      in both new and existing businesses, new jobs and the first graphene-based\u000a      products reaching the market. Alongside these economic impacts, there have\u000a      been significant public policy impacts, with substantial shifts globally\u000a      in science and innovation budgets.\u000a    ECONOMIC IMPACTS\u000a    It has been estimated [A] that by 2010, 210 companies globally had made\u000a      significant corporate investments in bringing graphene and graphene-based\u000a      products to market &#8212; 88 between 2008-10 in the US, Japan, Korea, Germany,\u000a      UK and China. This activity covers three broad sectors: graphene\u000a      production, graphene-based technologies, and graphene-based products.\u000a    Graphene Production: Demand for graphene has grown rapidly,\u000a      prompting investment in scaling up and reducing the cost of production.\u000a      Total graphene output in 2009 was 12 tons, rising to 155-205 tons in 2013\u000a      [B (ii)], with a market value of around $10 million. Over 55 companies\u000a      have entered the sector, with at least 24 formed since 2008. It was\u000a      estimated in 2011 that there was already $40M invested in small graphene\u000a      producers [B (iii)]. During the past two years there has been significant\u000a      investment in scaling up production. As examples: XG Sciences (revenues of\u000a      $4 million in 2012) have invested $10.5 million to scale-up production\u000a      from 3 tons to 80 tons pa with staff numbers increasing from 8 to 30\u000a      between 2010-12 [C]; Ningbo Morsh Technology have invested $30 million in\u000a      a 300 ton pa production line in Zheijian Province, China [D]; and Garmor\u000a      Inc have invested in a 100-ton pa facility in Orlando, with plans to\u000a      employ 80-100 employees over 5 years [E]. Although financial data is not\u000a      available for all 55 companies active in the field, these three alone\u000a      account for recent investments of around $50m, leading to a conservative\u000a      estimate of at least $200m invested in scaling-up production capacity.\u000a    Graphene-based Technologies: Several large multinational\u000a      companies are known to be active in developing graphene-based\u000a      technologies, including IBM, Samsung, BASF, Nokia, Sandisk, and Fujitsu\u000a      [B, F, G]. Although details of the financial investments involved are not\u000a      available, the scale of activity from these companies can be judged by the\u000a      volume of associated graphene-related patents. Between 2008-12 7740\u000a      patents were published, roughly half by the corporate sector [G].\u000a      Continuing investment is exemplified by the 33% growth in the patent\u000a      family portfolios of the top corporates in the field since 2010.\u000a    Graphene-based Products: Graphene-based products have begun\u000a      to reach the market, for example: HEAD graphene composite tennis racquets,\u000a      Vorbeck conductive inks, Powerbooster touchscreens, Ovation Polymers\u000a      ExTimaTM graphene\/polymer masterbatch compounds, Bluestone Grat-PowerTM\u000a      SiGP graphene-enhanced anode materials, and Cabot LITX G700 graphene-based\u000a      battery additive. Although it can be difficult to obtain commercially\u000a      sensitive financial information on the investments needed to bring\u000a      products to market or the resulting sales, we provide three illustrative\u000a      examples:\u000a    \u000a      HEAD has an established reputation in hi-tech sports equipment. In\u000a        2012, they brought to market a range of graphene-reinforced-composite\u000a        racquets, exploiting the high specific bonding area characteristics of\u000a        graphene to achieve a significant advance in strength-to-weight ratio\u000a        [H]. This allowed the weight of the mid-section of the racquet to be\u000a        reduced, leading to significant improvements in handling. By late June\u000a        2013, the company reported they were on course to sell 200k graphene\u000a        racquets in 2013 [H]. Retailing for around $150, this equates to a sales\u000a        value of $30m, at least half of which is likely to have been in the REF\u000a        period. It is also noted that sales of graphene-based racquets are\u000a        displacing other racquets that the company markets [H].\u000a      Shanghai-based Powerbooster, working with graphene producers,\u000a        Bluestone Global Tech, are manufacturing graphene-based touch screens.\u000a        In a June 2013 online interview with the Wall Street Journal, they\u000a        reported monthly sales of 2m screens, which translate to revenues of\u000a        roughly $10m per month [I].\u000a      Vorbeck Materials introduced Vor-inkTM, graphene-based\u000a        conductive ink for printed electronics in 2009. With MeadWestvaco, a\u000a        global packaging company, they developed a printed anti-theft packaging\u000a        system that is now used by major US retailers including Home Depot and\u000a        CVS [J], generating annual revenues for Vorbeck of $1m-$2.4m [K]. To\u000a        meet customer demand for Vor-inkTM, Vorbeck invested in\u000a        real-estate and equipment in 2012 to increase their production capacity\u000a        to over 40 tons pa, with further investment in a new production facility\u000a        opening in late 2013 [L].\u000a    \u000a    POLICY IMPACTS\u000a    The isolation and characterisation of graphene also led to significant\u000a      shifts in science funding policy, with major public investments in\u000a      graphene research and commercialisation around the globe. A 2011 survey of\u000a      European funding for graphene-related R&amp;D found significant funding in\u000a      26 countries, with major priority progammes in 7 [M]. In total, European\u000a      national funding in the period 2008-11 was &#8364;177m, compared to &#8364;2.5m before\u000a      2008, with the European Commission providing &#8364;87m over the same period. In\u000a      Jan 2013, the Commission announced a further &#8364;1000m investment over ten\u000a      years in a graphene Future and Emerging Technologies Flagship Initiative.\u000a      In the USA, the National Science Foundation awarded around $200m in the\u000a      period 2008-12 [N]. In Asia, South Korea is reported to be spending more\u000a      than $350m on graphene commercialisation initiatives [B(ii),O]; the\u000a      National University of Singapore invested $31M in a Graphene Research\u000a      Center in 2010, attracting $47M support from the National Research\u000a      Foundation a year later [P]; and China invested $81m in government funds\u000a      between 2002-2012, on a rapidly rising trajectory [Q]. Cumulatively, these\u000a      initiatives represent a seismic shift in public funding for science, with\u000a      at least $2.4bn committed to date.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The isolation and characterisation of graphene by Geim and Novoselov\u000a      demonstrated its potential to underpin disruptive technological change\u000a      across an incredibly broad range of industries.

He set out to convey\u000a      the excitement of particle-physics research, through the broadcast media,\u000a      contributing significantly to public interest in, and understanding of,\u000a      the search for the Higgs boson, and has gone on to popularise many other\u000a      areas of science. His deep understanding of much of the material he\u000a      presents makes him an authoritative voice, and his specific expertise in\u000a      particle physics regularly informs his media work. With Jeff Forshaw, his\u000a      writing on popular science books adds to the reach of the impact.\u000a    Spreading the excitement of particle physics\u000a    2008 saw the iTunes release of the final 4 in a series of 12 CERN-LHC\u000a      podcasts funded by the STFC in which \"Dr Brian Cox invites a series of\u000a        unlikely guests around the biggest experiment in the history of the\u000a        universe\" which have become popular downloads [A]. Shortly after\u000a      these, Cox was interviewed on the BBC Horizon programme \"The 6 Billion\u000a      Dollar Experiment\" whilst he was working at CERN. As a result of that\u000a      initial appearance, Andrew Cohen (current Head of Science at the BBC)\u000a      invited Cox to present \"The Big Bang Machine\" for BBC4. In this 1 hour\u000a      show, first broadcast on 4 September 2008, \"Brian Cox visits Geneva to\u000a        take a look around CERN's Large Hadron Collider before this vast, 27km\u000a        long, machine is sealed off and a simulation experiment begins to try\u000a        and create the conditions that existed just a billionth of a second\u000a        after the Big Bang\" [B]. This programme was repeated 3 times after\u000a      initial broadcast (Sept 2008, Jan 2009, Aug 2011) and was seen by a total\u000a      of over a million viewers of which nearly 40% were female &#8212; unusual for a\u000a      programme about physics &#8212; with a broad range of ages (16% 4-15, 43% 16-34\u000a      and 33% 55+) [C].\u000a    Taking science broadcasting to a new level\u000a    Building on his background in particle physics, the success of \"Big Bang\u000a      Machine\" led rapidly to three further Horizon programmes: \"What on Earth\u000a      is wrong with gravity?\", \"What time is it?\" and \"Can we make a star on\u000a      Earth?\". The success of these programmes was the trigger for the \"Wonders\u000a      of the Solar System\" five-programme mini-series. Audience figures for the\u000a      series were extremely high and persistent, averaging over 3 million per\u000a      programme, and regularly featuring in the top 3 BBC2 programmes of the\u000a      week [C]. Wonders of the Solar System won a Peabody Award in the USA for\u000a      excellence in documentary film making. In 2011 Cox won \"Best Presenter\" at\u000a      the Royal Television Society awards for Wonders of the Solar System and at\u000a      the Broadcasting Press Guild Awards he won the award for best performer in\u000a      a non-acting role, while Wonders of the Solar System was named best\u000a      documentary series.\u000a    The two further five programme series: \"Wonders of the Universe\" and\u000a      \"Wonders of Life\" succeeded in building on that initial success, with\u000a      audiences for Wonders of the Universe programmes averaging well over 3\u000a      million, and ranked in the top two BBC2 programmes, and Wonders of Life\u000a      averaging around 2.5 million. The \"Wonders\" programmes have also been\u000a      broadcast internationally [USA August 2010, Australia March 2011, New\u000a      Zealand April 2011, Netherlands April 2011]. The impact of the three\u000a      \"Wonders\" series on viewers is also evidenced by associated book and DVD\u000a      sales (165k DVD\/BluRay were sold for the first two Wonders series as of\u000a      end of May 2012 [D] and the three \"Wonders\" books, co-written with Andrew\u000a      Cohen, head of science at the BBC and published by Harper Collins, have\u000a      sold more than 600,000 copies worldwide to date. The associated app and\u000a      e-books have sold over 303,000 copies to date [E]).\u000a    The impact of these programmes on the broadcasting media, and the BBC in\u000a      particular, is clear from repeat showings, re-commissioning and associated\u000a      invitations for Cox to appear on other shows, including several\u000a      appearances on The Jonathan Ross Show, The One Show, The Sky at Night, QI,\u000a      Blue Peter, BBC Radio 5 Live and The Today Programme. Cox has a regular\u000a      science slot on BBC6 Music's Shaun Keaveny Breakfast Show and has made\u000a      many other one-off appearances on other TV and radio programmes. In 2009,\u000a      Cox became co-host (with comedian Robin Ince) of the BBC Radio 4 series\u000a      \"The Infinite Monkey Cage\". The show won a Gold Award in the 2011 Sony\u000a      Radio Awards and continues to be broadcast: the 8th series was\u000a      broadcast in 2013. Cox is also the co-host (with comedian Dara O'Briain)\u000a      of the annual \"Stargazing Live\" event broadcast on BBC2 in 2011, 2012 and\u000a      2013. After the most recent of these, amazon.co.uk announced a 500%\u000a      increase in telescope sales [F].\u000a    Cox also has a long-standing collaboration with Professor Jeff Forshaw.\u000a      Together they have written two best-selling popular science books, \"Why\u000a      does E=mc2?\" (da Capo) and \"The Quantum Universe\" (Penguin), which have\u000a      sold 434k copies to the end of 2012 [G]. These books have been translated\u000a      into several languages and the figures quoted here are only for USA\/Canada\u000a      and UK sales. They have been commissioned to write a further book for\u000a      Penguin, to be published in 2014. Forshaw has also written several\u000a      articles in the national press related to LHC physics [H]. He appeared on\u000a      \"BBC Breakfast\" in July 2012 to talk about the discovery of the Higgs\u000a      boson and, in January 2012, he was on the BBC Radio 4 \"Today\" programme to\u000a      discuss the Higgs boson with CERN Director General Rolf-Dieter Heuer.\u000a    Influencing public debate on science\u000a    Cox's impact on public debate is further illustrated by the following\u000a      example. In November 2010, Cox delivered the Royal Television Society's\u000a      \"Huw Wheldon Lecture\" entitled \"Science: A Challenge To TV Orthodoxy\"\u000a      (broadcast on BBC2). This lecture was explicitly mentioned in the 2nd\u000a      report of Session 2010-2012 of the House of Lords Select Committee on\u000a      Communications, \"The governance and regulation of the BBC\", to which Cox\u000a      gave evidence in May 2011, and also in Professor Steve Jones' report in\u000a      the \"BBC Trust Review of Impartiality and Accuracy of the BBC's Coverage\u000a      of Science\" (July 2011).\u000a    Cox's impact on the public understanding of science has been recognised\u000a      by several major awards. In 2010 he was awarded an OBE for his services to\u000a      science. He was awarded prizes in science communication from the Institute\u000a      of Physics (2010 Kelvin Medal \"For communicating the appeal and excitement\u000a      of physics to the general public through the broadcast media\") and the\u000a      Royal Society (2012 Faraday Prize \"For his excellent work in science\u000a      communication\"). His extraordinary impact on popular culture is also\u000a      indicated by the fact that, in 2011, he was ranked the 11th\u000a      most influential man in Britain according to GQ Magazine. Forshaw was also\u000a      awarded the 2013 Kelvin Medal of the Institute of Physics \"for his\u000a      wide-reaching work aimed at helping the general public understand complex\u000a      ideas in physics\".\u000a    Impact on recruitment of young people to science\u000a    Brian Cox's impact in helping popularize science in general and physics\u000a      in particular has led to what is now termed \"The Brian Cox Effect\" by the\u000a      media. Examples include: \"Brian Cox Effect leads to surge in demand for\u000a      physics, Daily Telegraph, 11 January 2013; \"The Brian Cox effect is a star\u000a      turn\", Daily Telegraph, 6 September 2011; \"Making science sexy: The Brian\u000a      Cox effect\", BBC Radio 5 Live (Tony Livesey), 8 March 2011; and \"A-levels\u000a      boom in maths and science credited to Brian Cox effect\", The Guardian, 18\u000a      August 2011, in which Ziggy Liaquat (managing director of Edexcel) said of\u000a      the increasing presence of science and maths in popular culture: \"It could\u000a      be the Brian Cox effect. It could be as simple as that.\" These claims are\u000a      made in part because of a large increase in the numbers of students\u000a      studying physics over the past few years. For example, according to UCAS\u000a      [H], the number of applications (\"choices\") to universities to study\u000a      physics has increased year-on-year from 17.0k in 2008 to 25.9k in 2012 (a\u000a      52% increase), which is a more rapid rise than in the other sciences\u000a      (mathematics (+19%), chemistry (+27%) and biology (+35%)). It is hard to\u000a      quantify the extent of Cox's contributions to these increases, but the\u000a      abundant media coverage and statements like the one above from Liaquat and\u000a      the following quote from Professor Sir Peter Knight (President of the\u000a      Institute of Physics), do indicate that the widespread perception is of a\u000a      very significant effect [J]:\u000a    \"Year-on-year we are seeing increases in the number of students\u000a        choosing to sit physics A-level. As physics has enjoyed popular\u000a        rejuvenation - thanks, in no small part, to the `Brian Cox effect' and\u000a        the excitement surrounding the Large Hadron Collider...The incremental\u000a        increases each year have led to a significant long-term trend. Over the\u000a        last five years, the number of A-level exams taken across all subjects\u000a        has risen 7.7% but the growth in the number entering for physics is far\u000a        stronger - a 19.6% increase over the last five years. Students across\u000a        the country are hearing the cry for more scientists and rising to the\u000a        challenge!\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research in particle physics at Manchester has impacted on the public\u000a      understanding and appreciation of science around the world by underpinning\u000a      the hugely successful media impact of Professor Brian Cox, which in turn\u000a      has had a strong influence on societal views of science.

The first\u000d\u000a      is in the field of Laser Photomedicine where the researchers were looking\u000d\u000a      into ways of using light to treat vascular lesions and other skin\u000d\u000a      conditions. The main research findings were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      That a filtered flashlamp (now known as an Intense Pulsed Lightsource\u000d\u000a        (IPL)) was successful in treating a range of skin lesions [1];\u000d\u000a      That by varying the pulse length of the flashlamp, different types of\u000d\u000a        lesions at varying depths within the tissue could be targeted [1];\u000d\u000a      That by pre-cooling the tissue with a cryogen spray, deep lesions\u000d\u000a        could be treated without causing damage to the surface tissue [2].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Since this initial work, the group in Manchester has worked on a range of\u000d\u000a      other sources, including fibre lasers [6], and has also used these for\u000d\u000a      tissue interaction studies, which has informed the development of new\u000d\u000a      laser devices by Lynton Lasers Ltd (used for hair and tattoo removal).\u000d\u000a    The second area is in the field of compact, efficient, diode-pumped laser\u000d\u000a      sources. This resulted in techniques for spectrally matching sources with\u000d\u000a      pump bands to improve efficiency and power output in Diode-Pumped Solid\u000d\u000a      State (DPSS) lasers.

This\u000a      requires accurate knowledge\u000a      of the behaviour of electrons and ions in the electrostatic and magnetic\u000a      fields of the\u000a      instrumentation. Consequently, a software package (CPO) was developed to\u000a      model this behaviour\u000a      precisely. Analytical instruments using charged-particle optics are also\u000a      widely used in industry.\u000a      These instruments also need to have the highest performance for the\u000a      increasingly demanding\u000a      requirements of customers. Consequently, a spin-off company was formed to\u000a      make CPO available\u000a      to manufacturers of scientific instruments and other users of electron\u000a      optics. This company, called\u000a      Charged Particle Optics Ltd, was started by two staff from the School of\u000a      Physics and Astronomy\u000a      (Read &amp; Bowring).\u000a    The principle advantage of CPO for customers is that it is one or two\u000a      orders of magnitude more\u000a      accurate than conventional finite element or finite difference methods.\u000a      This has been demonstrated\u000a      by more than 200 benchmark tests that are based on problems that have well\u000a      known analytical\u000a      solutions. These benchmark tests are readily available to prospective\u000a      customers, [A] and these\u000a      tests have established CPO as the gold standard of charged particle\u000a      optics. This superior accuracy\u000a      provides, for example, enhanced mass resolution in a mass spectrometer\u000a      [text removed for\u000a      publication]. Other important advantages are that CPO can easily deal with\u000a      electrodes of any\u000a      shape and of very different sizes, such as nano-sized electrodes in\u000a      centimetre-sized systems, and\u000a      because CPO is a charge-based method, it can deal with systems that\u000a      include space charge\u000a      and\/or cathodes. These are of crucial importance to manufactures of high\u000a      throughput analysis\u000a      tools, [text removed for publication] . Moreover, a manufacturer can use\u000a      CPO to develop and test\u000a      designs for new products before any metal is machined, saving them\u000a      considerable time and cost\u000a      [text removed for publication].\u000a    CPO has been sold [text removed for publication].\u000a    Illustrative Examples of Impact\u000a    (i) [text removed for publication].\u000a    (ii) [text removed for publication]\u000a    (iii) At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California, CPO was used to\u000a      simulate the electron\u000a      ionizer in the prototype of a gas chromatographic mass spectrometer system\u000a      that was later flown\u000a      as a flight version to the International Space Station (ISS). The purpose\u000a      of this instrument is to\u000a      monitor the concentration &#8212; at the parts-per-million to parts-per-billion\u000a      levels &#8212; of trace, toxic\u000a      chemical species in the ISS cabin atmosphere.

As part of\u000a      the research\u000a      programme, a software package called Charged Particle Optics (CPO) was\u000a      developed to simulate\u000a      the motion of charged particles in electrostatic and magnetic fields; see\u000a      [5] for a recent description.\u000a      Underpinning this research was the development of a three-dimensional\u000a      technique, which employs\u000a      the Boundary Element (BE) method for solving electromagnetic\u000a      problems rather than conventional\u000a      Finite Element (FE) or Finite Difference (FD) methods. This\u000a      BE method is one or two orders of\u000a      magnitude more accurate than FE or FD methods for the same computing time\u000a      [5]. Other\u000a      advantages of CPO software are that it can deal with electrodes of\u000a      essentially any shape and it is\u000a      particularly powerful for space-charge problems such as electron guns. In\u000a      the course of the\u000a      research, CPO was also developed to handle magnetic fields as well as\u000a      electrostatic fields.\u000a    The use of CPO led to the following key advances: (i) the design of\u000a      electrostatic lenses with very\u000a      low aberrations, which was achieved through the high accuracy in modelling\u000a      electron trajectories,\u000a      (ii) the development of high-current electron guns, which exploited the\u000a      ability of CPO to include the\u000a      effects of Coulomb interactions between charged particles [3], (iii) the\u000a      optimisation of three-dimensional\u000a      electron optical devices [2] and (iv) the invention of new electron\u000a      optical devices [1]. A\u000a      good example of this is the invention of the magnetic angle-changer.\u000a      This enabled for the first time,\u000a      electrons that are scattered from a gaseous target be detected over the\u000a      full range of scattering\u000a      angle, from 0 to 180&#176;, [4,6]. This enabled theory to be tested in regions\u000a      that were previously\u000a      inaccessible to experiment and provided the most accurate values of\u000a      scattering cross-sections that\u000a      are of practical importance. The magnetic angle-changer was described by\u000a      an international\u000a      conference speaker [text removed for publication] as \"the most important\u000a      development in low-\u000a      energy electron spectroscopy in 25 years\".\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28178","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1062947","Name":"Madagascar"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"933860","Name":"Botswana"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"934292","Name":"Mauritius"},{"GeoNamesId":"3355338","Name":"Namibia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Manchester has been at the heart of the science arguments and the\u000d\u000a      technical development programme which has established the viability of the\u000d\u000a      SKA. Over the past decade the concept has been defined both scientifically\u000d\u000a      and technically by hundreds of astronomers and engineers in over 60\u000d\u000a      research institutions in a dozen countries with some outputs in Section 3.\u000d\u000a      The sites have been selected; precursor instruments have been constructed\u000d\u000a      in several countries; the international organisation has been formed;\u000d\u000a      pre-construction design funding is in place and international industry is\u000d\u000a      closely involved in the planning. Impact from the scientific and technical\u000d\u000a      research programmes is in four areas: international science policy and\u000d\u000a      priorities; human capacity building outside UK academia; economic impact\u000d\u000a      from contracts for non-UK infrastructures; economic impact from the\u000d\u000a      establishment of the international SKA Organisation as a limited company\u000d\u000a      in the UK to lead the design and construction of the SKA.\u000d\u000a    4.1 Science policy and priorities [A]: The policy impact began\u000d\u000a      when the coordinating international \"SKA Organisation\" (SKAO) was formed\u000d\u000a      in 2011. The SKAO has representatives from Australia, Canada, China,\u000d\u000a      Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and the UK\u000d\u000a      (chair) with India as an associate member. These partners together\u000d\u000a      committed a total budget of &#8364;120M for the \"pre-construction\" design phase\u000d\u000a      in 2012Q2-2016Q3, On a pro rata basis ~25% (&#8364;30M of which &#8364;3.9M is for the\u000d\u000a      SKAO see Section 4.4) can be attributed up to 31 July 2013. The site\u000d\u000a      decision was taken in May 2012 and broke new ground in that the SKA will\u000d\u000a      be the first fully international science infrastructure to be embedded in\u000d\u000a      Africa. The higher frequency \"dish\" array will be built in the Northern\u000d\u000a      Cape Province, South Africa and there will be SKA telescope outstations in\u000d\u000a      Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique, Kenya, Ghana, Madagascar and\u000d\u000a      Mauritius. Complementary lower frequency and \"survey\" arrays will be built\u000d\u000a      in Australia.\u000d\u000a    Europe-South Africa [B]: The South African SKA programme has been\u000d\u000a      directly influential in creating new political links between Africa and\u000d\u000a      Europe. The African-European Radio Astronomy Platform (AERAP) was set up\u000d\u000a      in May 2012 as a response to the European Parliament's Written Declaration\u000d\u000a      45\/2011 `on Science Capacity Building in Africa: promoting\u000d\u000a      European-African radio astronomy partnerships'. This call was repeated by\u000d\u000a      the Heads of State of the African Union, in their decision\u000d\u000a      `Assembly\/AU\/Dec.407 CXVIII', for radio astronomy to be a priority focus\u000d\u000a      area for Africa-EU cooperation. AERAP's aim is to \"enable major research\u000d\u000a      and technological advances that will drive socioeconomic development and\u000d\u000a      competitiveness in both Africa and Europe\". The European Parliament's\u000d\u000a      AERAP Group was established in November 2012 to secure on-going political\u000d\u000a      support for its activities. AERAP is now coordinating a strategic\u000d\u000a      \"Framework Programme for Cooperation\" shaped around European investment in\u000d\u000a      science infrastructure; human capital development; ICT and big data;\u000d\u000a      education and public awareness.\u000d\u000a    4.2 Human Capacity Building in Africa [C,D,E,F]: The importance of\u000d\u000a      the SKA project to South Africa can be judged from the address to the\u000d\u000a      National Assembly by the Science and Technology Minister Derek Hanekom in\u000d\u000a      May 2013. \"[the decision] to host the greatest portion of the Square\u000d\u000a      Kilometre Array radio telescope [in South Africa], was a massive\u000d\u000a      acknowledgement of the capabilities of our scientists and engineers, and\u000d\u000a      the advances our country has made in science and technology...The\u000d\u000a      construction of the 64-dish MeerKAT has commenced, and will be completed\u000d\u000a      by 2016. On its own, the MeerKAT will be the largest radio telescope in\u000d\u000a      the Southern Hemisphere.\" Minister Hanekom's immediate predecessor Naledi\u000d\u000a      Pandor said \"Radio astronomy partnerships with Africa can make a valuable\u000d\u000a      contribution to economic development... By training a new generation of\u000d\u000a      highly qualified scientists to work on African projects, they can boost\u000d\u000a      the region's human capital and keep many of Africa's brightest young minds\u000d\u000a      in Africa.\" A significant part of the build-up of scientific\/technical\u000d\u000a      education and training in Africa can be directly attributed to the SKA.\u000d\u000a    The approach to \"bottom up\" scientific and technical capacity-building\u000d\u000a      associated with SKA South Africa is impressive and multifaceted. In the\u000d\u000a      period 2008-13, 401 young people benefited from SKA South Africa bursaries\u000d\u000a      and scholarships, including many students from other African countries,\u000d\u000a      comprising: Post-Doctoral Fellowships (39); Bursaries for Post-graduate\u000d\u000a      (207), Undergraduate (103), BTech and National Diploma (28) students\u000d\u000a      together with Internships (10) and Artisan programmes (14). The total is\u000d\u000a      currently growing at over 90 per year. At the top level five new research\u000d\u000a      chairs dedicated to science and instrumentation of astronomy have been\u000d\u000a      established: at Rhodes University, Stellenbosch University, the University\u000d\u000a      of Cape Town, the University of the Western Cape and the University of the\u000d\u000a      Witwatersrand. A new generation of scientists is growing in Southern\u000d\u000a      Africa&#8212;in 2003 there were 12 practising radio astronomers, while already\u000d\u000a      by 2011 this had grown to over 60.\u000d\u000a    The SKA has also stimulated interest in astronomy undergraduate education\u000d\u000a      in the African partner nations with developments in Madagascar, Botswana\u000d\u000a      and Ghana; however Kenya has taken a lead. Since 2009 the University of\u000d\u000a      Nairobi has enrolled 53 undergraduate students in Astronomy &amp;\u000d\u000a      Astrophysics, and in 2013 the first cohort of 14 graduated with a BSc.\u000d\u000a      These students are largely inspired by the SKA and many hope to get SKA or\u000d\u000a      other scholarships to enable them pursue postgraduate studies.\u000d\u000a    4.3 National infrastructures [A,G,H]: Starting after 2008 and as\u000d\u000a      pivotal components of their strategies for winning the site competition,\u000d\u000a      both South Africa and Australia began to construct &#8364;150M SKA \"precursor\"\u000d\u000a      radio telescopes (KAT-7\/MeerKAT and ASKAP respectively). Constructing\u000d\u000a      these new national infrastructures has opened up new areas of business\u000d\u000a      resulting in commercial contracts for both local and international\u000d\u000a      companies and new local employment within the projects. The construction\u000d\u000a      of KAT-7 has been completed, while that of ASKAP is largely completed and\u000d\u000a      that of MeerKAT is well underway.\u000d\u000a    Over 120 young scientists and engineers are working on the MeerKAT\u000d\u000a      project, based at the engineering office in Cape Town, and at universities\u000d\u000a      and companies across South Africa and Africa. 75% of the total contract\u000d\u000a      will be spent in South Africa. Project delivery is led by Aurecon\u000d\u000a      (infrastructure); Stratostat Datacom (antennas, with technical help from\u000d\u000a      General Dynamics SATCOM Technologies); Brink &amp; Heath Civils (roads);\u000d\u000a      EMSS Antennas (receivers). The project has added 800 construction jobs in\u000d\u000a      an area with 25% unemployment. The site infrastructure work alone has\u000d\u000a      created jobs for 269 adults and 191 youths. As well as those of\u000d\u000a      construction, the project has demanded that South African companies\u000d\u000a      acquire new skills. LJ du Toit, EMSS managing director, has stated\u000d\u000a      \"MeerKAT's electromagnetic (EM) requirements have grown significantly\u000d\u000a      since [2005], and I am proud to say that we as a company have grown with\u000d\u000a      it, and have managed to keep up with the technology needs\". Stratostat\u000d\u000a      Datacom's owner Alan Geldenhuys' focus is to engage local industry,\u000d\u000a      especially in terms of local content, skills transfer and the upliftment\u000d\u000a      of surrounding communities: \"We foresee a great sense of community with\u000d\u000a      the local towns' people\". The economic effects on the North Cape Province\u000d\u000a      reach down to local levels. For example in the town of Carnarvon, MeerKAT\u000d\u000a      contracts to the value of &#8364;400k from eight \"emerging contractors\" and\u000d\u000a      orders to the value of &#8364;2.5M from 30 suppliers have been awarded. These\u000d\u000a      emerging contractors have obligatory participation goals which require\u000d\u000a      worker training and they have been assisted in registering with South\u000d\u000a      African Construction Industry Development Board and with registering\u000d\u000a      workers with the Department of Labour. MeerKAT is also providing further\u000d\u000a      business and entrepreneurship training to local suppliers\/contractors. It\u000d\u000a      should be noted that normal issues of economic displacement are much less\u000d\u000a      relevant in developing economies.\u000d\u000a    4.4 Employment and the local economy in Cheshire [I,J]: The SKAO\u000d\u000a      is now constituted as an independent UK company, limited by guarantee. Its\u000d\u000a      Office moved to a new building at Jodrell Bank Observatory in November\u000d\u000a      2012. The successful UK (Manchester, Cambridge and Oxford) proposal to\u000d\u000a      host the Office attracted letters of support from 19 UK companies, from\u000d\u000a      the Minister for Universities &amp; Science, from MPs and representatives\u000d\u000a      of Regional Government (available on request). The Office is supported\u000d\u000a      entirely by the International Organisation with funding totalling &#8364;22.8M\u000d\u000a      through 2015 of which 17% (~&#8364;3.9M) had been spent by 31 July 2013. The\u000d\u000a      final staff target is 49 FTE, 19.6 of whom, drawn from the international\u000d\u000a      community, were in place by 31 July 2013. The impact on the local economy\u000d\u000a      is greater than the up-front spend; the net multiplier is ~1.5, giving a\u000d\u000a      total economic impact to 31 July 2013 of ~&#163;4.5M (&#8364;5.3M).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The international Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope, due for\u000d\u000a      completion in the next decade, will be the world's largest astronomical\u000d\u000a      instrument.

The originating idea arose in\u000d\u000a      Manchester in 1991. In 2004 the international astronomy community came\u000d\u000a      together to describe the SKA's scientific potential and to establish the\u000d\u000a      generic characteristics of a telescope with the required transformational\u000d\u000a      capabilities. In 2005 this science case catalysed EC and pan-European\u000d\u000a      national funding for a coordinated &#8364;32M programme of technological\u000d\u000a      research which gave initial substance to the ambitions. This research in\u000d\u000a      turn formed a major component of the international preliminary design\u000d\u000a      specification in 2011. Throughout, Manchester researchers have been\u000d\u000a      central &#8212; both in the invention and generation of the original ideas and\u000d\u000a      in the experimental development leading to the design of a\u000d\u000a      transformational instrument. The key players have been: Professors P.\u000d\u000a      Wilkinson (1993-present), R. Spencer (1993-2010), M. Kramer (1998-2008),\u000d\u000a      S. Garrington (1993-present), P. Diamond (1998-2009), R. Schilizzi\u000d\u000a      (2008-present), Dr. A. Faulkner (2004-9).\u000d\u000a    Science insights: The SKA science case focusses on six key ideas.\u000d\u000a      Kramer and Wilkinson were lead authors on papers originating two of these:\u000d\u000a      \"Strong Field Tests of Gravity using Pulsars and Black Holes\" [1] and\u000d\u000a      \"Exploration of the Unknown\" [4] respectively. The research insights are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Pulsars will provide the most precise tests of General Relativity. The\u000d\u000a        many millisecond pulsars discovered with the SKA will also probe the\u000d\u000a        stochastic gravitational wave background.\u000d\u000a      The legacy of the SKA will arise from new types of observations it\u000d\u000a        alone will permit. This puts an onus on its designers and operators to\u000d\u000a        allow for the exploration of the unknown. A philosophy was outlined\u000d\u000a        enabling c21st radio astronomers to add to the many discoveries made in\u000d\u000a        the c20th.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Technological research: The pan-European SKA Design\u000d\u000a      Study Programme (SKADS 2005-9) was a systematic study of technological\u000d\u000a      solutions for the SKA&#8212;primarily as a flexible \"electronic telescope\" based\u000d\u000a      on phased aperture arrays (AAs). Wilkinson chaired the SKADS Board and was\u000d\u000a      P.I. of the UK programme. SKADS showed that at low frequencies AAs are\u000d\u000a      able to deliver high survey speeds coupled with high dynamic range and\u000d\u000a      extreme flexibility, consonant with SKA as \"discovery instrument\".\u000d\u000a      Faulkner (SKADS Project Engineer on the UK grant) played a leading role in\u000d\u000a      the AA programmes [2,5]. Diamond (now International SKA Director) and\u000d\u000a      Schilizzi (International SKA Director 2003-11) led the SKA Preparatory\u000d\u000a      phase during which the global radio astronomy community developed a first\u000d\u000a      system design for the SKA, prior to the site decision in 2012. The SKA\u000d\u000a      Project Execution Plan [6] was led by Schilizzi. AAs are a pivotal feature\u000d\u000a      of the SKA design for the lower part of its frequency range. For the many\u000d\u000a      individual antennas of the SKA to be combined coherently as a single\u000d\u000a      telescope, their signals must be synchronised to a few picoseconds over\u000d\u000a      distances greater than 100km. This has been achieved over an optical fibre\u000d\u000a      data transport network using a technique developed at Jodrell Bank for the\u000d\u000a      e-MERLIN array [3] and now in routine array operation. This research and\u000d\u000a      experience provided the confidence that an affordable fibre-based\u000d\u000a      synchronisation system could be provided for the SKA and is the basis for\u000d\u000a      Manchester's international leadership of the SKA data transport and\u000d\u000a      synchronisation development.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28179","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Exhibitions\u000a    The Royal Society's annual Summer Science Exhibition showcases the most\u000a      exciting cutting-edge\u000a      science and technology research [A]. It provides a unique opportunity for\u000a      members of the public to\u000a      interact with scientists and ask them questions about their work. The\u000a      Exhibition is the Society's\u000a      main public event of the year, and is open to members of the general\u000a      public as well as students\u000a      and teachers, scientists, policymakers and the media [A]. The exhibitions\u000a      have taken place\u000a      annually since 1778, and are widely regarded as the UK's premier public\u000a      engagement event in\u000a      science. Our increased participation during the REF period reflects a\u000a      strategic decision by the UoA\u000a      to target this event as a vehicle for optimum science communication,\u000a      drawing systematically on our\u000a      most exciting and ambitious research. Part of this strategy is to reuse\u000a      resources produced for the\u000a      Exhibits building a lasting legacy on the initial development. Since 2008,\u000a      we have led or played a\u000a      major (50%) role in 4 exhibits:\u000a    AO: ALMA Observatory &#8212; probing our cosmic\u000a          origins with ALMA (6 days, 2012) developed in\u000a      collaboration with Cambridge and led in Manchester by Avison (RA), with\u000a      UoM providing about half\u000a      the exhibition team (6 staff, 3 PhD students).\u000a    SF: Putting sunshine in the tank &#8212; using\u000a          nanotechnology to make solar fuel (6 days, 2011)\u000a      led by UoM (PI Flavell, staff), a collaboration with York, Nottingham and\u000a      East Anglia. UoM\u000a      provided over half the team of 23 staff, RAs and PhDs.\u000a    GR: Carbon Flatland &#8212; unexpected science in a\u000a          pencil line (6 days, 2011) has exhibit team of\u000a      30 from various UoM Schools including Physics and Astronomy (including\u000a      Novoselov, staff).\u000a    LC: Liquid crystals: living cells and flat\u000a          screen TVs (10 days, 2010) was led in Manchester by\u000a      Dierking (staff) and Gleeson (staff), and in collaboration with\u000a      Southampton, York and Sheffield\u000a      Hallam. The exhibit was largely built in Manchester.\u000a    We have also made significant contributions (ca. 15-30%) to a\u000a      further 4 exhibits in the period:\u000a    PL: Planck: Looking back to the dawn of time\u000a      (7 days, 2013). A collaboration with Imperial\u000a      College, the Cambridge, Oxford and Cardiff. UoM RAs Watson and Peel\u000a      designed and built part of\u000a      the stand; 8 UoM staff, RAs and PGs made up 20% of the exhibit team.\u000a    HB: Higgs Boson &#8212; understanding the Higgs\u000a          Boson (7 days, 2013). A collaboration of 17 UK\u000a      universities and RAL. The UoM team was led by Soldner-Rembold (staff) with\u000a      4 PDRAs\/PGs; UoM\u000a      provided prizes (books signed by Cox (staff)), and part of an online\u000a      booklet.\u000a    HP: From the oldest light to the youngest\u000a          stars: the Herschel and Planck Missions' (5 days,\u000a      2009) A collaboration with Cardiff, Cambridge, Imperial College, the\u000a      Mullard Space Science\u000a      Laboratory, RAL and UK ATC, with Lowe (RA) leading for UoM.\u000a    NW: Is there anybody out there? Looking for\u000a          new worlds (4 days, 2008) With the Open\u000a      University, QUB, St Andrews, Hertfordshire, Keele and The Faulkes\u000a      Telescope Project. Our\u000a      contribution on microlensing was led by Rattenbury (RA).\u000a    Selection and Preparation\u000a    Seven of the exhibits were selected by the Royal Society via a\u000a      competitive process &#8212; e.g. the solar\u000a      fuel exhibit (SF) was one of 21 exhibits selected from 97\u000a      applications. Selection criteria included\u000a      the quality of the underpinning research, and track record in public\u000a      engagement. The graphene\u000a      exhibit (GR) was by invitation following the award of the 2010\u000a      Nobel Prize in Physics. Significant\u000a      funds were raised from external bodies to enhance a number of the\u000a      exhibits, for example SF\u000a      benefitted from a &#163;46k EPSRC `Pathways to Impact' award, enabling\u000a      construction of a solar fuel\u000a      demonstrator. Seven of the exhibits were staged at Carlton House Terrace (NW,\u000a      HP, SF, GR, AO,\u000a      HB, PL). The 2010 exhibit, LC, was part of a Festival of\u000a      Science and Arts, held at London's\u000a      Southbank Centre in celebration of the Society's 350th anniversary.\u000a    Impact on Visitors to the Exhibits\u000a    In total, the eight exhibits received more than 94,000 visitors. Those at\u000a      the Royal Society saw\u000a      between 5,000-14,000 visitors each, while the 2010 anniversary exhibition\u000a      received almost 50,000\u000a      visitors [C]. As a typical breakdown of these visitors, the 2011\u000a      exhibition (SF, GR) was attended by\u000a      around 14,000 visitors made up of GCSE and A-level students (1852, from 92\u000a      schools and\u000a      colleges), teachers (224), representatives of the media (45), FRS\/VIP\u000a      guests (1425) and other\u000a      members of the public (10265). The school visitors were gender balanced,\u000a      54% white ethnic and\u000a      86% from non-independent schools; 91% agreed they enjoyed talking to the\u000a      scientists [C].\u000a    Captivating and enthralling hands-on demonstrations were developed for\u000a      all exhibits. As illustrative\u000a      examples, these included (for LC) displays of the beautiful\u000a      iridescence of chiral liquid crystals in\u000a      temperature sensing devices and on the backs of bugs, and visitors were\u000a      amazed to see dramatic\u000a      changes when viewed with polarizing light. Members of the public made\u000a      liquid crystals undergo\u000a      phase transitions and saw their response to electric and magnetic fields.\u000a      At SF, visitors were able\u000a      to make quantum dots luminesce, operate a solar nanocell, producing\u000a      hydrogen at the stand, and\u000a      race solar-fuel-powered model cars against the solar-powered equivalent\u000a      using our solar-powered\u000a      Scalextrix. At GR, visitors were able to make graphene themselves\u000a      using sellotape, and their\u000a      samples were examined by optical microscopy to confirm that graphene had\u000a      been made &#8212; an\u000a      achievement that resulted in the award of a chocolate Nobel Prize medal\u000a      and badge. At PL,\u000a      visitors were able to use a telephone to dial up the sound of the Big\u000a      Bang. Typically 60-75% of\u000a      student visitors felt that the exhibition had made them more interested in\u000a      science, and more\u000a      interested in the possibility of a science-based career [C].\u000a    Impact on Virtual Visitors &#8212; Web Resources and Media Coverage\u000a    Alongside each exhibit, significant web-based resources were developed,\u000a      all of which have a life\u000a      after the exhibition. These included the exhibit web sites (which remain\u000a      live and active [A]) and (for\u000a      the later exhibits) blogs, handouts\/booklets (e.g. HB [B]),\u000a      factsheets (e.g. HP, NW), materials for\u000a      teachers (e.g. LC [D]), videos and an Ask the Scientist\u000a      question and answer forum, live during the\u000a      exhibition. As examples, in 2013 (PL, HB), the main exhibition\u000a      website was visited 113,630 times\u000a      [C] and the 2011 main site (SF, GR) has been shared on over 3400\u000a      social networking sites.\u000a    The web-based resources developed during each exhibition have contributed\u000a      significantly to our\u000a      ongoing public engagement activities. For example, web-based interactive\u000a      games and quizzes\u000a      designed for the SF exhibit (allowing the player to make enough\u000a      solar fuel to launch a rocket) have\u000a      been played over 4,500 times (and reused on the UoM website), while a\u000a      linked YouTube video has\u000a      more than 18,500 views. A graphene virtual microscope iPhone app (GR)\u000a      has now been\u000a      downloaded over 10,000 times from Google Play and iTunes. One of the key\u000a      elements of HP was\u000a      the Chromoscope software tool to explore multi-wavelength views of\u000a      the Universe (lead developer\u000a      Lowe, RA). This has been used since in exhibitions including the Big Bang\u000a      Fair Manchester in\u000a      2010 (22,000 visitors), and was developed into a web-based application [E]\u000a      which had around 1.5\u000a      million users in its first year. It has also been incorporated into a\u000a      popular `touchtable' exhibit that\u000a      has been in use at Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre (JBDC) since it opened in\u000a      2011 [F], receiving\u000a      more than 235,000 visitors. A major feature of AO was the Pynterferometer,\u000a      a piece of interactive\u000a      software which allowed exhibition-goers to use a touchscreen to drag\u000a      `antennas' around and\u000a      investigate how this affects the output of a telescope. This has led to a\u000a      publication [G], is available\u000a      for download, and is being developed further for display at JBDC.\u000a    Significant media coverage was generated during and after each exhibit.\u000a      This included BBC news\u000a      coverage (TV [H] and website [I]), numerous blogs (such as Climate\u000a        Change for Obama, SF [J])\u000a      and many specialist magazines including The Engineer and Business\u000a        Weekly.\u000a    The Legacy &#8212; Sustained Public Engagement\u000a    Following each exhibit, we have received a substantial number of requests\u000a      to participate in follow-on\u000a      activity, in the UK and elsewhere. As an example, the graphene exhibit (GR)\u000a      has been\u000a      subsequently in action at the Manchester Science Festival (MSF) 2011, 2012\u000a      and 2013, during\u000a      National Science and Engineering Week (NSEW) 2012 and 2013, at Jodrell\u000a        Bank Live (JBL) 2012\u000a      and 2013 (a science exhibition\/rock concert, 11,000 visitors in 2012), in\u000a      3 Meet the Scientist events\u000a      at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, and at graphene EU\u000a      flagship promotion\u000a      events, such as the Graphene 2012 International Conference in Brussels (10th-13th\u000a      April 2012).\u000a      The latter was attended by 600 researchers, industrialists, policymakers\u000a      and investors. More\u000a      generally the exhibits have been in demand at large venues such as JBL,\u000a      MSF, NSEW and Big\u000a      Bang, London (LC, 30,000 visitors) but also in smaller events\u000a      targeting `difficult to reach groups',\u000a      for example, the solar-powered Scalextrix from SF was a highlight\u000a      of Revolution &#8212; a fun day in\u000a      Ancoats, an inner city area of Manchester, 2011, part of Moving\u000a        Planet: a day to move past fossil\u000a        fuels [K]. The exhibitors have collectively given a huge number (we\u000a      estimate, hundreds) of public\u000a      engagement talks to e.g. Sci-Bars, Caf&#233;-Scientifiques, Guilds,\u000a      professional bodies such as IOP\u000a      and IChemE, and schools. Feedback from follow-on events suggests that this\u000a      engagement is as\u000a      effective as the original exhibitions [e.g. F]; this allows us to estimate\u000a      (conservatively) that this\u000a      legacy activity has positively influenced more than 60,000 students\u000a      towards choosing a science-based\u000a      career.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    We demonstrate a sustained record of the highest quality public\u000a      engagement with physics,\u000a      evidenced by the selection of our research for the Royal Society Summer\u000a      Science Exhibition on\u000a      eight occasions in six successive years (2008 - 2013).

Many of the unique\u000a        properties of graphene\u000a        and its derivatives were discovered and explored in the School. Key\u000a        among these are the\u000a        feasibility of working with atomically-thin films [4], the relativistic\u000a        behaviour of charge carriers, a\u000a        new kind of Quantum Hall Effect, and the observation of fast spin\u000a        currents in graphene.\u000a      Research from 2007 on the photonic and surface properties of quantum\u000a        dots as light-\u000a        harvesting elements in next-generation solar cells, and their wider use\u000a        in the generation of\u000a        solar fuel, includes the first observation of 'carrier multiplication'\u000a        (creation of more than one\u000a        carrier pair per incoming photon) in InP quantum dots [5].

Hitachi\u000a      established a corporate research laboratory in Cambridge, the Hitachi\u000a      Cambridge Laboratory (HCL), which has since provided UK employment to\u000a      10-15 Hitachi researchers at any point in time. Between 2008-2012 HCL has\u000a      generated 17 patents, 8 of which are joint with Cavendish researchers.\u000a    As a leading manufacturer of supercomputers Hitachi has a strategic\u000a      interest in quantum computing for applications including communication\u000a      security or weather\/climate modelling. The silicon qubit structure\u000a      realised originally by Hasko (Ref. 2) is currently the main development\u000a      direction pursued by Hitachi for solid-state quantum computers and has led\u000a      Hitachi to invest considerable development resources in its R&amp;D\u000a      laboratories in Japan and Europe. The attraction of the approach is that\u000a      it can be implemented using silicon-based mass manufacturing techniques.\u000a      Hitachi's teams in Cambridge and Japan are focussed on improving the\u000a      reproducibility of these silicon double quantum dot devices and on\u000a      realising computing systems based on integrating multiple quantum bits. At\u000a      present the Hitachi team in HCL developing silicon-based quantum computing\u000a      comprises 10 engineers and scientists. The team is interacting closely\u000a      with Hitachi's main R&amp;D Laboratory in Tokyo, where a state-of-the-art\u000a      silicon fabrication line is used to supply HCL with full-scale wafers of\u000a      quantum computing structures based on the University's original double dot\u000a      design. In this way the original university research has contributed\u000a      directly to securing 23 Hitachi jobs in the UK since 2008.\u000a    Up to 2012 Hitachi owned Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST), a\u000a      world-leading, hard-disk manufacturer and Hitachi's main interest in\u000a      spintronics was focussed on novel approaches to enable higher hard-disk\u000a      storage capacity. The novel spintronics architectures realized by Irvine\u000a      and Ferguson (Ref. 3 &amp; 7), became candidates for the next-generation\u000a      of hard-disk read-heads and were actively being developed by HGST. In 2012\u000a      Hitachi sold HGST to Western Digital for $4.6 billion. Western Digital is\u000a      actively developing magnetic random access memory (MRAM) technology based\u000a      on the spin Hall effect (Wunderlich et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 047204\u000a      (2005) and Ref. 4 &amp; 5). The merit of spin-Hall effect induced\u000a      switching is that no spin-polarized charge current is flowing across a\u000a      tunnelling barrier minimizing heat and fatigue of the barrier. In the\u000a      industry it is widely expected that the next generation of MRAM devices\u000a      will use this technology.\u000a    The focus of the spintronics R&amp;D in Hitachi shifted. Hitachi is a\u000a      world leading manufacturer of high-end microprocessors and retains a\u000a      strong interest in spintronics for ultralow power electronics. In\u000a      particular, the spin-injection Hall effect device and the spin-Hall\u000a      transistor first fabricated by Irvine (Ref. 4 and 5) have provided Hitachi\u000a      with powerful architectures for realising spin-based logic circuits with\u000a      very low power dissipation. Hitachi currently employs 10 researchers in\u000a      the UK who develop these architectures and who interface with a larger\u000a      spintronics development team in Hitachi's Central R&amp;D laboratory in\u000a      Tokyo of about 15 scientists and engineers. This company-internal,\u000a      spintronics development effort in the UK and Japan is supported mainly by\u000a      Hitachi funds.\u000a    Hiroaki Odawara, General Manager of European R&amp;D for Hitachi,\u000a      comments on the impact of the University research on Hitachi's past and\u000a      present product portfolio: \"The work performed on single electron devices\u000a      within the Microelectronics Group in the 1990s had a direct impact on a\u000a      large-scale memory device subsequently developed by Hitachi for a leading\u000a      computer manufacturer and which forms part of the International Technology\u000a      Roadmap for Semiconductors. This went into large-scale preproduction but\u000a      unfortunately not into production as the client developed severe financial\u000a      difficulties. However, it provided the technology \/ manufacturing basis\u000a      for Hitachi's current exploitation of the University's double quantum dot\u000a      architecture for the development of a quantum computer. Since 2008 the\u000a      University spintronics research had a significant impact in HGST. Several\u000a      of the architectures realized first by University researchers were being\u000a      developed by HGST for hard-disk drive (HDD) read-head sensors prior to the\u000a      sale of HGST to Western Digital in 2012. Currently, single-electron and\u000a      spintronic devices, whose provenance is directly traceable to work in the\u000a      Microelectronics Group of the Cavendish are being investigated as\u000a      candidate sensors in healthcare applications which is an increasingly\u000a      important business area for Hitachi.\"\u000a    At a higher, possibly slightly less tangible, but not less important\u000a      level Hitachi's continued investment in fundamental physics research is\u000a      generally aimed at identifying new and fundamental approaches to future\u000a      information processing. This is of strategic importance for Hitachi. As a\u000a      systems company Hitachi needs to understand important trends in computing\u000a      to provision its customers with computing solutions that will satisfy\u000a      future needs and requirements. The continued collaboration with the\u000a      Cavendish has allowed the company to understand how fundamental\u000a      breakthroughs in fundamental physics could impact computing in the long,\u000a      &gt; 10 year timescale and has already influenced the strategic directions\u000a      Hitachi is taking in its own, internal development of quantum\u000a      supercomputers and ultralow power electronics, as explained above. In 2008\u000a      Hitachi staged a 2-day technology exhibition, \"Hitachi inspire life\", at\u000a      the QEII Conference Centre opposite the Houses of Parliament. It was\u000a      visited not only by Hitachi customers but also key decision makers in\u000a      government.

Ahmed (retired 2003)\u000a      developed a world-leading competence in the fabrication and measurement of\u000a      very small semiconductor and metal nanostructures (Ref.1) and their use in\u000a      single-electron devices. Under Prof. Ahmed's leadership single-electron\u000a      transistor (SET) and memory devices were realized, including the\u000a      phase-state, low-electron number drive memory (PLEDM) in 1999.\u000a    This competence in fabrication and measurement of nanoscale single\u000a      electron devices then became the basis of pioneering research projects in\u000a      the field of quantum information processing (QIP) and spintronics. The\u000a      Cavendish group, by then under the leadership of Dr. D. Hasko (Assistant\u000a      Director of Research at the Cavendish from 1996, Senior Research Associate\u000a      from 2006, joined the Department of Engineering 2009) and funded by a\u000a      Basic Technology grant from EPSRC, reported in 2004 the realisation of a\u000a      solid state quantum bit based on a single-electron double quantum dot in\u000a      silicon for QIP (Ref. 2). This double dot architecture represents a\u000a      powerful solid-state implementation of a quantum bit, which can be\u000a      integrated in conventional silicon technology.\u000a    In 2004, with the appointment of Prof. H. Sirringhaus as Hitachi\u000a      Professor of Electron Device Physics the research focus was expanded and a\u000a      new research direction on spintronics was established. Dr. A. Irvine, a\u000a      senior assistant in research in the Microelectronics Group since 2002,\u000a      developed the critical fabrication of advanced spintronic device\u000a      architectures. Dr. Irvine's fabrication led in 2006 to the realisation of\u000a      a new concept for a highly sensitive magnetoresistance device, the Coulomb\u000a      blockade anisotropic magnetoresistance (CBAMR) (Ref. 3), in 2009 to the\u000a      first demonstration of the spin-injection Hall effect (Ref. 4, patent\u000a      application JP2010122211) and in 2010 to the first realisation of a\u000a      spin-Hall effect transistor (Ref. 5). The CBAMR is based on a\u000a      single-electron transistor with a ferromagnetic semiconductor, in which\u000a      small changes of the magnetic field strength or direction induce\u000a      variations in the electrochemical potential of the SET island and\u000a      associated changes in the device resistance. The spin-Hall effect\u000a      transistor can be considered as the first realisation of a spin transistor\u000a      (as originally postulated theoretically by Datta and Das) and uses an\u000a      external gate field to modulate the spin precession of an injected spin\u000a      current in a semiconducting channel. The discovery of the CBAMR and the\u000a      spin-injection Hall effect, which were first fabricated by Irvine, have\u000a      been recognized by awards of two, highly prestigious Hitachi R&amp;D group\u000a      technology prizes (Kenkai) in 2006 and 2009, respectively.\u000a    A third breakthrough was achieved by Dr. A Ferguson, an Hitachi sponsored\u000a      Senior Research Fellow in the Cavendish since 2007. Dr. Ferguson has\u000a      extensive experience in the physics of electron dynamics in single-atom\u000a      and single-spin solid-state quantum systems. In 2012 Dr. Ferguson's\u000a      realized a novel, very sensitive magnetoresistance device structure. In\u000a      this architecture the gate electrode of a transistor is fabricated from a\u000a      magnetic material with a strong magnetic anisotropy, which can transduce\u000a      changes in the applied magnetic field into changes in the effective gate\u000a      voltage (Ref. 6, European Patent application, EP12172627).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28880","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our physics and astronomy research has inspired, stimulated and\u000d\u000a      entertained literally millions of people [see Section 5, C1-C6], and the\u000d\u000a      discovery of the Higgs boson has generated exceptional interest around the\u000d\u000a      world and challenged people's perceptions of the foundations of the\u000d\u000a      universe.

There have\u000d\u000a      been at least 27 distinct press `stories', producing many more press\u000d\u000a      releases internationally. These press releases are routinely picked up by,\u000d\u000a      for example, the BBC web pages [C2], because of their mass appeal to a\u000d\u000a      ready audience [C3]. There have been extensive media appearances\u000d\u000a      (including Oliver on Sky at Night, 6 April 2009 [C4] and HerMES\u000d\u000a      featuring in the Radio 4 Today programme, 19 April 2013, average\u000d\u000a      audience 6 million) and high-profile stands at major national events like\u000d\u000a      the Royal Society Summer Exhibition 2012 and the Big Bang Fair (2010,\u000d\u000a      2011, 2012, 2013).\u000d\u000a    Romer and Baskill recorded an audio slideshow [C5] covering the\u000d\u000a      highlights from 10 years of the XMM-Newton observatory. In the piece,\u000d\u000a      Romer describes the XMM-Newton images taken as part of her XMM cluster\u000d\u000a      survey [see Section 3, R2]. The slideshow was accessed over 100,000 times\u000d\u000a      from the BBC web site within the first day of availability alone [C5].\u000d\u000a    The Higgs boson's role in generating elementary particle masses has\u000d\u000a      stimulated the public imagination and became the topic of popular science\u000d\u000a      such as Leon Lederman's 1993 book The God Particle. Following the\u000d\u000a      4 July 2012 discovery, fundamental physics figured in public awareness in\u000d\u000a      a way probably not seen since Eddington's 1919 confirmation of General\u000d\u000a      Relativity, with front-page coverage in newspapers around the world, for\u000d\u000a      example The Wall Street Journal, The Times and The\u000d\u000a        Independent. In particular The Guardian, with its front-page\u000d\u000a      headline `Higgs was right', makes the direct comparison with the famous\u000d\u000a      1919 headline `Einstein was right' [C6].\u000d\u000a    Inspiring people to contribute to scientific investigations and\u000d\u000a          changing how science is done\u000d\u000a    Our research has underpinned the Galaxy Zoo Project [C7], which aims to\u000d\u000a      address the scientific problem that, while the human eye is the best tool,\u000d\u000a      the galaxies from SDSS were too numerous to be classified by professional\u000d\u000a      astronomers. Galaxy Zoo enlists members of the public to classify galaxy\u000d\u000a      images. One million SDSS images were made available via the Galaxy Zoo\u000d\u000a      webpage http:\/\/www.galaxyzoo.org\u000d\u000a      in July 2007. Within 24 hours of its launch, Galaxy Zoo received almost\u000d\u000a      70,000 classifications per hour. More than 100 million classifications\u000d\u000a      were received by 2009, contributed by more than 200,000 people [C8] who\u000d\u000a      are individually acknowledged on the web page. These classifications have\u000d\u000a      led directly to some substantial new scientific findings &#8212; e.g. [R4]. A\u000d\u000a      prime example is the discovery of a new class of galaxy, first noted by\u000d\u000a      Galaxy Zoo volunteers [C9]. Given its groundbreaking character, Galaxy Zoo\u000d\u000a      has been the subject of academic research into the motivations and\u000d\u000a      benefits of the science to the volunteers. A study by Johns Hopkins\u000d\u000a      researchers [C8] involved interviews with 22 volunteers and an analysis of\u000d\u000a      online forum posts. The interviewees comprised people from many walks of\u000d\u000a      life, including a judge, a theatre draftsperson, a chemist and an\u000d\u000a      investment banker. According to the interview responses, motivations range\u000d\u000a      from fun and interest in the beauty of the pictures to, importantly, the\u000d\u000a      stretching of the imagination and the `slight probability that I may point\u000d\u000a      out the one object that will completely shock our current understanding\u000d\u000a      about the universe' and the excitement of contributing to original\u000d\u000a      scientific research. A desire to help (volunteerism) is also evident, as\u000d\u000a      is a desire to meet people with the same interests. Galaxy Zoo is an\u000d\u000a      influential pioneer in the field of `citizen science', as discussed in the\u000d\u000a      press, for example in a Guardian article [C10], spawning public\u000d\u000a      engagement in other branches of science &#8212; The Zooniverse at https:\/\/www.zooniverse.org\u000d\u000a\u0009  includes studies of cyclones, climate change and cancer data. It\u000d\u000a      figures prominently in Michael Nielsen's book Reinventing Discovery:\u000d\u000a        The New Era of Networked Science, which argues for an `open science\u000d\u000a      imperative' to reinvent discovery, which will `help address our most\u000d\u000a      critical human problems'.\u000d\u000a    Our science influencing artistic and cultural collaboration\u000d\u000a    We have been engaged as scientific consultants on various arts projects.\u000d\u000a      A highlight was the well-received play `Constellations', which premi&#232;red\u000d\u000a      at the Royal Court, moved to the Duke of York's Theatre (West End, London,\u000d\u000a      2012 [C11]) and is expected to become a feature film. The lead character\u000d\u000a      is an Astronomer from Sussex, the script specifically mentions the XCS\u000d\u000a      survey [R2] and Romer and Liddle were the Chief Scientific Advisors.\u000d\u000a      Herschel SPIRE influenced a scene in an episode of the Big Bang Theory!\u000d\u000a      (April 2013), reaching 14-20 million viewers.\u000d\u000a    In 2009, Harris joined with the organisers of the Adur Festival, an Arts\u000d\u000a      Festival in the South Coast region, and composer-performer Richard\u000d\u000a      Durrant, to create a musically and visually accompanied lecture on the\u000d\u000a      search for the neutron's EDM [R6] and its implications [C12]. The\u000d\u000a      intention was for the audience to `experience science in a completely new\u000d\u000a      way' and so the music was written using notes generated by the\u000d\u000a      experimental data [C12]. During a Q&amp;A session, the sell-out audience\u000d\u000a      was `by all accounts, overwhelmed', with reactions ranging from struggling\u000d\u000a      with the perceived `anti-religious' implications of the research to a\u000d\u000a      better understanding and affection for fundamental science [C12].\u000d\u000a    In conclusion Sussex physics research has changed the way the\u000d\u000a      theatre-going public, the scientifically-engaged public and the general\u000d\u000a      public appreciate aspects of fundamental physics and the scientific\u000d\u000a      process, and has facilitated better engagement with scientific research,\u000d\u000a      resulting in increased scientific literacy.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Large numbers of the public have been inspired and delighted by Sussex\u000d\u000a      research on high-profile fundamental physics, through media coverage and\u000d\u000a      cultural interpretation of this work, but also by participating in the\u000d\u000a      process and contributing directly to further discoveries.

The aim is both to improve teaching and to raise pupils'\u000d\u000a      interest directly. The means by which this is achieved is through talks at\u000d\u000a      schools, bringing pupils into the University, and through the continuing\u000d\u000a      professional development of teachers.

For example, in the academic year 2011\/12 we worked with 5,024\u000d\u000a      students (see Table 1). They engaged with departmental research through\u000d\u000a      physics days, master classes, research talks, schools lab days and\u000d\u000a      lectures, both on and off the University campus.\u000d\u000a    We offer a wide selection of talks [C4] covering all our research areas,\u000d\u000a      and given by staff visiting schools and colleges. We also run regular\u000d\u000a      physics days on campus throughout the year, including master classes in\u000d\u000a      particle physics (an astronomy master class is currently under\u000d\u000a      development), both for GCSE and for A-level students. These include a\u000d\u000a      research talk, lab tours, live video links to Sussex PhD students at CERN\u000d\u000a      working on the ATLAS experiment, and other hands-on physics activities.\u000d\u000a      During 2011\/12 alone, members of the Department talked about their\u000d\u000a      research to groups at or from about 100 schools [C5].\u000d\u000a    Schools lab days\u000d\u000a    During the school terms, we run a weekly Schools Lab day in our dedicated\u000d\u000a      Schools Lab facility, where GCSE, AS- and A2-level students visit us for a\u000d\u000a      full day of experimental physics. As part of the day, the students,\u000d\u000a      together with their teacher or teachers, attend a research talk where a\u000d\u000a      different researcher describes her\/his work each week.\u000d\u000a    On a recent Schools Lab day (17 May 2013), a group of GCSE students from\u000d\u000a      Dorothy Stringer School in Brighton, together with their physics teacher,\u000d\u000a      Andy Latham, attended a talk about the principles of the Standard Model\u000d\u000a      and the story of the ATLAS discovery of the Higgs boson through H&#8594;ZZ and\u000d\u000a      H&#8594;03b303b3. The group, which consisted of eight female and two male\u000d\u000a      students, subsequently reflected on the topic during their classes. In a\u000d\u000a      snap poll at the event, 80 per cent stated their intention to continue to\u000d\u000a      A-level physics. Feedback from Mr Latham submitted in June [C6] states:\u000d\u000a    Not only was the lecture informative for the students but it sparked a\u000d\u000a      significant amount of debate about the standard model and its development\u000d\u000a      as a theory. From that discussion we are now looking into taking a group\u000d\u000a      of students next year to CERN and possibly holding master classes for KS4\u000d\u000a      students here in experimental and theoretical physics, such was the\u000d\u000a      interest from students. The number of female students was accidental but\u000d\u000a      incredibly encouraging. We at Stringer strive to increase the number of\u000d\u000a      female students taking up further education in Physics and it's days such\u000d\u000a      as this that make our job easier.\u000d\u000a    Enhancing science teaching in schools\u000d\u000a    We regularly host teacher-training events such as the recent `Physics\u000d\u000a      Update' course. Key decision-points for students are not only when they\u000d\u000a      apply for university, but also at the transition from GCSE to A-levels.\u000d\u000a      This is where the `bottleneck' of STEM undergraduates is formed. The\u000d\u000a      science teachers at GCSE and A-levels hence play a pivotal role in\u000d\u000a      addressing this societal challenge. We run continuing professional\u000d\u000a      development events for teachers several times a year, informing them about\u000d\u000a      the findings of our current research through talks by faculty members,\u000d\u000a      answering their questions, and giving them ideas, as well as materials,\u000d\u000a      that they can use in the classroom.\u000d\u000a    In March 2013, we organised and ran the Institute of Physics `Physics\u000d\u000a      Update' 3-day international conference, which was attended by 34 teachers\u000d\u000a      from across the UK. Follow-up demonstrated that this conference has had a\u000d\u000a      real impact in the classroom &#8212; for example, Claire Aspinal [C7] says that\u000d\u000a      at her school in Cheshire they have:\u000d\u000a    ...discussed new developments with pupils e.g. Quantum computing to help\u000d\u000a      them understand where a career in physics could take them. [...] [We]\u000d\u000a      purchased the particle zoo to help pupils understand fundamentals\u000d\u000a      particles better. We are taking 30 AS\/A level students to CERN in\u000d\u000a      December.\u000d\u000a    Justin Walker [C8] said\u000d\u000a    My department has decided to buy a [Geiger-Mueller Tube] like the one you\u000d\u000a      demonstrated [...] I used photos from the ion isolation qubit storage lab\u000d\u000a      in lessons on atomic theory and digital data transmission.\u000d\u000a    Each summer, we hold an evening event for local teachers, giving them the\u000d\u000a      opportunity to explore the Department, to see our latest offerings, and to\u000d\u000a      network with other teachers in the region. This event has an attendance of\u000d\u000a      approximately 45 teachers each year. During the 2011 event, Prof.\u000d\u000a      Wolfgange Lange gave tours of our AMO research laboratories, prompting the\u000d\u000a      following unsolicited feedback: `Faculty members such as Dr Lange [were]\u000d\u000a      engaging in making physics understandable and accessible for a relative\u000d\u000a      \"newbie\" (read \"chemist\"!) like me' &#8212; Jason O'Grady, Hove Park School,\u000d\u000a      July 2011 [C6].\u000d\u000a    The UK Herschel outreach project has also produced many educational\u000d\u000a      resources based, in particular, on the Herschel SPIRE instrument: http:\/\/herschel.cf.ac.uk\/education.\u000d\u000a      These resources have been very well received by teachers and used to\u000d\u000a      improve their teaching in the classroom. Dr Keith Moseley (Head of\u000d\u000a      Physics, Monmouth School) says, `The standard approach to teaching the\u000d\u000a      electromagnetic spectrum is significantly enhanced by showing, through the\u000d\u000a      resources associated with the Herschel Telescope, the multi-wavelength\u000d\u000a      universe' [C9]. David Grace, (PGCE teacher), said `I have used [Herschel\u000d\u000a      educational resources] myself with Year 9 and Year 12 pupils in school...\u000d\u000a      I know that some of this year's students also used them in school on their\u000d\u000a      practices and found them appropriate and very useful' [C10]. In addition\u000d\u000a      Sophie Allan, who is the National Space Academy physics teacher engaged in\u000d\u000a      developing and teaching physics programmes for the Academy, as well as\u000d\u000a      running CPD, said\u000d\u000a    I have used the Herschel resources with both student and teacher\u000d\u000a      groups...The resources worked very well...They really brought\u000d\u000a      multiwavelength astronomy to life in a manner that was relevant to the\u000d\u000a      curriculum, time saving and gave a fantastic modern context to the topic.\u000d\u000a      I have also introduced many other teachers to the resources through CPD\u000d\u000a      sessions that I have been leading, and they have all been thoroughly\u000d\u000a      impressed!' [C11].\u000d\u000a    Evolution of UG student uptake in the region\u000d\u000a    Strong evidence of the impact on pupils comes from the rise in UG student\u000d\u000a      uptake not only at our institution, but across the South East (the main\u000d\u000a      reach of our, and our SEPnet partners', outreach activities). One teacher\u000d\u000a      commented \"we have seen an increasing number of students choosing Physics\u000d\u000a      at Uni over the last few years, and we believe this is partly because of\u000d\u000a      the positive experience they have had of Uni physics in the schools' lab\"\u000d\u000a      [C13]. Based on SEPnet data [C12], the overall SEPnet physics UG\u000d\u000a      population has roughly doubled from 967 in 2007 to 1,813 in 2012\/13, and\u000d\u000a      the Sussex UG population from 131 to 229. This significantly outpaces the\u000d\u000a      national growth of 34 per cent over the same period and goes some way to\u000d\u000a      alleviate the societal problem of a lack of STEM graduates. The\u000d\u000a      correlation with the onset of SEPnet and our enhanced outreach activities\u000d\u000a      strongly suggests that it arises in part as a result of our research, as\u000d\u000a      communicated through our engagement.

These questions include clarifying the origin of mass\u000d\u000a      of elementary particles (via the search, discovery and study of Higgs\u000d\u000a      particles) and the ongoing search for Dark Matter, which constitutes\u000d\u000a      approximately 25% of the energy density of the Universe. There is a huge\u000d\u000a      level of interest in these topics in the public and the media, as\u000d\u000a      evidenced, for instance, by the number of hits generated by a Google\u000d\u000a      search for \"dark matter\" (\"higgs\"): in excess of 5 million (10 million)\u000d\u000a      hits.\u000d\u000a    The group at Royal Holloway that works on the ATLAS experiment at the\u000d\u000a      Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the CERN laboratory has had a long-standing\u000d\u000a      involvement in the search for, and now the study of, the Higgs particle\u000d\u000a      since Dr Pedro Teixeira-Dias joined the Department in 2001. Dr\u000d\u000a      Teixeira-Dias formed the Higgs group at Royal Holloway and has led it\u000d\u000a      since then. This group has had 8 PhD students (2 still ongoing), a\u000d\u000a      post-doctoral research assistant (Dr Ricardo Gon&#231;alo, 2003-13) and 2\u000d\u000a      academics (Teixeira-Dias and Prof. Glen Cowan) that have contributed\u000d\u000a      directly to the ATLAS searches for a light Higgs particle decaying either\u000d\u000a      to photons or to b-quarks. Gon&#231;alo and Teixeira-Dias have both lead the\u000d\u000a      UK-wide ATLAS Higgs working group, Gon&#231;alo has lead the ATLAS search for\u000d\u000a      Higgs to b-quarks at CERN, and Cowan &#8212; while convenor of the ATLAS\u000d\u000a      Statistics Forum at CERN &#8212; led the development of the statistical methods\u000d\u000a      that were central to the ATLAS Higgs searches and discovery. Other members\u000d\u000a      of the extended ATLAS group at Royal Holloway (totalling ~20\u000d\u000a      collaborators) contribute to other physics topics (academics Drs Boisvert\u000d\u000a      and Berry direct work on the study of the top quark, and on the searches\u000d\u000a      for extra space-time dimensions and new exotic particles, respectively)\u000d\u000a      and contribute to essential aspects of the design, construction,\u000d\u000a      commissioning and operation of the detector's data acquisition system and\u000d\u000a      its high-level trigger.\u000d\u000a    In September 2010, Dr Monroe (promoted to Professor in 2013) joined the\u000d\u000a      Department of Physics from MIT to start the Royal Holloway group working\u000d\u000a      on the search for dark matter. The group's research is focused on dark\u000d\u000a      matter search experiments with world-leading sensitivity and on the\u000d\u000a      development of novel sensitive particle detection techniques for future\u000d\u000a      experiments. The group was reinforced in January 2012 with the appointment\u000d\u000a      of Dr James Nikkel, a world-leading expert in liquid noble detectors, who\u000d\u000a      made many of the pioneering measurements establishing this technique for\u000d\u000a      dark matter detection. In addition, the group has 2 post-doctoral research\u000d\u000a      assistants, 5 PhD students (all ongoing) and 4 Masters students (who have\u000d\u000a      all completed). The group works on the DEAP\/CLEAN programme to develop\u000d\u000a      large liquid Argon detectors capable of reaching kilo-tonne scales for\u000d\u000a      dark matter and low-background frontier physics, on the LUX liquid Xenon\u000d\u000a      dark matter search, and on the DMTPC experiment. Monroe established a new\u000d\u000a      collaboration of UK institutions on the DEAP\/CLEAN experiment when she\u000d\u000a      moved to Royal Holloway, and leads the UK's contribution of the detector\u000d\u000a      calibration system hardware, software, and analysis. Royal Holloway leads\u000d\u000a      the neutron calibration sub-system and the dark matter search analysis\u000d\u000a      software development. Nikkel is the Detector Commissioning Manager and\u000d\u000a      leads the refrigeration system for DEAP\/CLEAN, collaborates on the LUX\u000d\u000a      liquid Xe dark matter search, and the liquid noble detector R&amp;D effort\u000d\u000a      in the laboratory at Royal Holloway. On DMTPC, Monroe is the spokesperson\u000d\u000a      of the DMTPC international scientific collaboration (since 2011), which is\u000d\u000a      developing optical-readout time projection chambers to search for the dark\u000d\u000a      matter wind. Monroe led the first DMTPC dark matter search result,\u000d\u000a      published in 2011, and the establishment of an underground laboratory at\u000d\u000a      the WIPP facility where DMTPC is now deployed. The Royal Holloway group\u000d\u000a      lead the time projection chamber and optical system design for the\u000d\u000a      next-generation DMTPC detector, currently under construction at MIT.\u000d\u000a    The group's research in these areas is further enhanced by Dr Kauer\u000d\u000a      (Higgs theorist) and Dr West (dark matter theorist.)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30241","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The primary beneficiary of our impact is OIN, and through them to a wider\u000a      community of scientists and industrial facilities that require ULT\u000a      platforms and reliable, convenient thermometry. The CSNT has also had\u000a      direct impact on the NMIs that maintain and disseminate the temperature\u000a      scales.\u000a    A strong program of collaboration and joint development with Oxford\u000a        Instruments Nanoscience, has led to the creation of new innovative\u000a        products. OIN is a global company that creates high performance\u000a      cryogenic and cryogen-free environments for ultra-low temperature and high\u000a      magnetic field applications in physics, chemistry and materials science.\u000a      The importance of these products has been recognised through a Queens\u000a        Award to Industry 2010, and the IoP Gold Medal in Business and\u000a        Innovation (Dr Graham Batey, 2011). These products have contributed\u000a      to OIN maintaining its leading world market share. The Technical Director\u000a      of OIN states in a letter of support: \"By identifying key areas of\u000a        collaboration and joint development it is clear that RHUL and OIN have\u000a        been able to use a strong and fruitful partnership for the benefit of\u000a        the wider scientific community by developing new products, the UK\u000a        economy by providing employment and commerce and the local scientific\u000a        community by providing training, collaboration and career development.\"\u000a      This partnership was formalised through a 2010 Memorandum of Understanding\u000a      (MoU) between Royal Holloway and OIN. OIN has invested in Royal Holloway\u000a      through a &#163;200k contribution to a &#163;800k low temperature infrastructure\u000a      upgrade in 2010. This consisted of a new nuclear demagnetisation cryostat\u000a      for the study of semi-conductor samples at ULT and a cryogen-free dilution\u000a      refrigerator which provided the platform for the first demonstration of\u000a      nuclear cooling below 1 mK on a cryogen-free system. This activity is\u000a      supported by a matched funding Impact PhD studentship.\u000a    The impact of the specific products developed is:\u000a    (1) The 1994 development of the cryogenic cycling fridge led directly to\u000a      the 1997 product launch of the Kelvinox AST. OIN built and delivered over\u000a      15 such systems up until 2003, with a combined revenue of &#163;1.3M. Most of\u000a      these systems are still in use today.\u000a    (2) The Kelvinox 400HA was developed based upon the prototype produced\u000a      through the EPSRC Joint Research Equipment Initiative [G1]. This product\u000a      has been on sale since 1998 and plays an active part in OIN's current\u000a      portfolio with over 50 systems delivered, with a combined revenue of over\u000a      &#163;7M.\u000a    (3) Based on the prototype microkelvin cryogen-free experimental\u000a      platform, OIN have launched in July 2013 the first such product,\u000a      responding to demand from the Quantum Information Processing community.\u000a      OIN are projecting that this field will develop into a global market worth\u000a      $1B by 2025.\u000a    Practical primary thermometry for ULT applications. The impact of\u000a      the development of the Current Sensing Noise Thermometer comes through its\u000a      influence on the policies of NMIs such as PTB (Berlin) and NPL (London)\u000a      and changing the procedures of OIN.\u000a    Disseminating the PLTS-2000 scale, where noise thermometry plays a\u000a      critical role, was achieved through the FP5 funded programme [G5]\u000a      supported by a Royal Society Study visit [G3]. This emphasized\u000a      discrepancies in PLTS-2000 [4,5], which are being addressed by the\u000a      EMRP-funded programme JRP-s13 \"Implementing the new Kelvin\" [G8]. This\u000a      EMRP project will arrive at a better determination of thermodynamic\u000a      temperature.\u000a    Through the EMRP project and building on earlier research [2,3], and\u000a      subsequent development partly funded by the West Focus PARK Fund [G6], in\u000a      2009 we developed a practical, fast and user friendly noise thermometer.\u000a      This provides a practical route for disseminating thermodynamic\u000a      temperatures to end users. The impact is to enable industrial suppliers of\u000a      low temperature platforms to factory test the performance, to test on site\u000a      as part of commissioning, and importantly to allow users\/customers\u000a      themselves to confirm continued operation. Our set-up was successfully\u000a      tested on the OIN factory site at Tubney Woods, and future OIN\u000a      cryogen-free systems will be delivered with a current sensing noise\u000a      thermometer for onsite performance tests, replacing the Cobalt-60\u000a      thermometer currently used.\u000a    Via our collaboration with PTB [G2, G7 and G9] our work has stimulated\u000a      the production of a related noise thermometer by Magnicon GmbH, a spin-off\u000a      company of PTB. Their product, the MFFT-1 (magnetic field fluctuation\u000a      thermometer), was launched in 2008 at ULT2008, \"Frontiers of Low\u000a      Temperature Physics\", a conference organised at Royal Holloway.\u000a    The long standing relationship with OIN has also helped supply their need\u000a      for high quality postgraduate level staff.

His research group has carried out\u000a      fundamental research into quantum fluids and solids at the ULT frontier,\u000a      publishing over a hundred articles in peer-reviewed journals.\u000a    The technical demands of operating in these extreme conditions have led\u000a      to the insights central to the impacts described in this case.\u000a    The production of cryogenic platforms to meet these demands was\u000a      in collaboration with an industrial partner, OIN, who turned the\u000a      proof-of-principle prototypes into commercial products. We describe\u000a      research which led to three distinct commercial products:\u000a    \u000a      The earliest example of impact resulted from a collaboration\u000a        (supported by a Royal Society Joint Project, 1988-93, and Kapitza\u000a        Fellowship, 1994) with Prof. Mikheev at Royal Holloway. The concept of\u000a        using activated charcoal as an internal pumping device in a dilution\u000a        refrigerator, removing the need for external vacuum systems was\u000a        successfully applied [1], achieving performance comparable with\u000a        conventional dilution refrigerators. Mikheev joined OIN in 1994 where\u000a        subsequent development led to the launch of a new product in 1997, the\u000a        Kelvinox AST.\u000a      In 1997, to meet the demands for a flexible platform for ULT\u000a        experiments, compatible with the access required for using SQUID\u000a        (superconducting quantum interference device) amplifiers, a large sample\u000a        volume cryostat coupled to extensive access for wiring and services was\u000a        designed jointly by Royal Holloway\/OIN and built by OIN (EPSRC Joint\u000a        Research Equipment Initiative grant [G1]) [4]. This ULT facility became\u000a        the prototype of the high-access OIN Kelvinox 400HA cryostat, launched\u000a        as a commercial product in 1998. The suitability of the facility for\u000a        SQUID based experiments was demonstrated through the programme of work\u000a        carried out in [G4].\u000a      The advent of cryogen-free dilution refrigerators, a rapidly growing\u000a        sector of turn-key low temperature platforms, has been of central\u000a        importance to the field of new quantum technologies. Within the European\u000a        Microkelvin consortium [G7] the LLTL has been promoting access to ULT\u000a        for the nanoscience community. A Royal Holloway\/OIN collaboration was\u000a        the first to successfully combine nuclear demagnetisation with\u000a        cryogen-free operation to reach sub-mK temperatures [6], launched\u000a        commercially in July 2013.\u000a    \u000a    A related strand of research, of crucial relevance to ULT research and\u000a      its technological applications concerns thermometry. This has\u000a      involved partnerships with OIN and with NMIs. An unsolved problem of\u000a      crucial relevance in low temperature physics was the ability to accurately\u000a      and conveniently measure the temperature, using a method traceable to\u000a      international temperature scales. The Royal Holloway group were the first\u000a      to demonstrate, on the ULT facility described previously, the practicality\u000a      of a current-sensing noise thermometer (CSNT) [2,3] for operation from 4 K\u000a      down to below 1 mK [patent P1]. The method exploits DC SQUIDs to detect\u000a      Nyquist thermal noise in a sensor. The direct link to the Boltzmann\u000a      constant, kB, is of particular relevance to the\u000a      NMIs, with whom we collaborate [4,5] in the dissemination of the\u000a      Provisional Low Temperature Scale (PLTS-2000). Through the European\u000a      Metrology Research Programme [G8] we are working to establish a new scale\u000a      to resolve discrepancies within PLTS-2000. Following [2,3] we have\u000a      developed an improved simple, practical and fast device, which measures\u000a      temperature with 1% precision in less than a second. The technology is\u000a      licensed to OIN, leading to the phasing out of the use of the Cobalt-60\u000a      Nuclear Orientation thermometer, to field test their cryostats. This\u000a      thermometer relies on its natural radioactivity, resulting in extensive\u000a      regulation for handling and transport, is slow and useful over only a\u000a      limited temperature range.\u000a    The step-change in performance arising from the advances made through our\u000a      research are transforming thermometry in this temperature range, by\u000a      providing a thermometer which can cover the entire temperature range, from\u000a      4K into the microkelvin regime, with high precision, and without the need\u000a      for calibration.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30242","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1820814","Name":"Brunei"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3625428","Name":"Venezuela"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    \"When business development manager Sarah Doyle first saw the video\u000a        tracking technology created by Mark Sugrue as part of his PhD thesis,\u000a        she says she recognised its commercial potential instantly.

The company specialises in video content\u000a      analysis, and has developed a tool for video retrieval and analysis aimed\u000a      at the law enforcement and security markets.\u000a    The company's technology allows users to search through video footage\u000a      using filters to pinpoint certain types of activity. The system works by\u000a      indexing the CCTV footage and then allowing the watcher to pinpoint areas\u000a      of interest, for example movement near a door or someone wearing a\u000a      particular colour. The technology identifies objects based on their unique\u000a      motion pattern, and can reliably identify humans, vehicles, colour and\u000a      direction of movement.\u000a    An officer investigating a break-in can use the system to pinpoint a\u000a      period on a CCTV tape that is of interest rather than watching through the\u000a      entire tape. For example, if an ATM was vandalised by someone in the\u000a      middle of the night, the investigating officer could use the software to\u000a      detect at which times there was human movement near the machine. The\u000a      efficient algorithms mean that, with modest computing power, multiple\u000a      video files can be batch-processed at speeds far higher than could be\u000a      achieved with a human reviewing the footage, leaving just the critical\u000a      sections of the video to be watched by the investigating officer.\u000a    Kinesense Ltd Chief Executive Officer Sarah Doyle estimates that the time\u000a      required to search a piece of footage can be reduced by 95 per cent using\u000a      their software. The improvement in speed of processing raw footage has\u000a      been of benefit to the Major Crimes Division of the Irish Police force who\u000a      said, about the Kinesense Law Enforcement (LE) product, \"Kinesense LE\u000a        enabled us to deliver a complete video timeline of a high-profile murder\u000a        case to the investigation team within 5 hours of the actual shooting\u000a        event.\"\u000a    The company's technology, which is sold as helping the global war against\u000a      crime, is currently being used by police forces, security agencies,\u000a      counter-terrorism units and serious crime units in Denmark, Ireland, the\u000a      UK, Venezuela, Canada and North Africa. Kinesense Ltd Sales Director Tony\u000a      Cahill has added more than 10 countries to this list so far in 2013 -\u000a      Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Turkey, Malaysia, Singapore,\u000a      Indonesia, Brunei, Australia, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil.\u000a    Kinesense has also expanded its customer base beyond law enforcement\u000a      agencies. British Telecom bought the technology to help stem losses of up\u000a      to &#163;2,000 a day through the theft of copper wire. The telecoms company\u000a      found thieves were stripping the valuable copper from utility poles and\u000a      sub-stations, causing disruptions to their services. The Kinesense\u000a      technology allowed BT to analyse CCTV footage in 30 minutes compared with\u000a      eight hours previously, speeding up the opportunity to arrest and\u000a      prosecute thieves.\u000a    Kinesense Ltd was initially supported by a &#8364;200,000 investment from\u000a      Enterprise Ireland under the High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) funding\u000a      programme. In September 2012 Kinesense Ltd secured a further &#8364;620,000\u000a      syndicated investment to focus on its international growth strategy. The\u000a      funding round was led by Kernel Capital through the Bank of Ireland Seed\u000a      and Early Stage Equity Fund, which contributed &#8364;500,000. The remainder of\u000a      the money was contributed by the Irish BES (Business Expansion Scheme) and\u000a      angel investors.\u000a    By October 2012 Kinesense Ltd employed 7 full-time staff, including\u000a      another Royal Holloway Physics PhD graduate from the Signal Processing and\u000a      Machine Vision group, Dr. Daniel Ellin, as Lead Software Engineer. The\u000a      company is now actively recruiting additional staff to support its growth.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The explosive growth in the number of CCTV cameras has meant that\u000a      analysing the volume of data produced has become almost unmanageable.\u000a      Dublin based start-up Kinesense Ltd was incorporated in 2009 by Dr Mark\u000a      Sugrue, who had carried out his PhD in Video Analytics at Royal Holloway.\u000a      New methods to detect motion, track objects and classify behaviour in CCTV\u000a      now enable the efficient scanning of video for important events.

R. Davies (Royal Holloway Department of Physics until 2008,\u000a      currently Emeritus Professor) is an international authority on machine\u000a      vision. He led the Signal Processing and Machine Vision research group in\u000a      the Department, until his retirement in 2008. He was awarded Distinguished\u000a      Fellow status by the British Machine Vision Association in 2005, and was\u000a      elected Fellow of the International Association for Pattern Recognition in\u000a      2008. He is author of Machine Vision: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities\u000a      (Academic Press, 4th edition 2012), Image Processing for the\u000a      Food Industry (World Scientific 2000), Electronics, Noise and Signal\u000a      Recovery (Academic Press, 1993).\u000a    The underpinning research on motion detection was undertaken by Davies in\u000a      conjunction with his PhD student Mark Sugrue (2003-2007), as part of an\u000a      EPSRC Basic Technology grant [G1], Next generation artificial vision\u000a        systems: reverse engineering the human visual processes.\u000a    Traditionally the analysis of video surveillance or CCTV footage has been\u000a      carried out by trained personnel who view lengthy footage aiming to\u000a      identify and time-stamp key events for use as evidence in court, or to aid\u000a      the police during an investigation. This laborious process is time\u000a      consuming and liable to human error. The field of video analytics has\u000a      grown, driven by the need to efficiently exploit the increasing coverage\u000a      by CCTV, in order to better promote safety, security and the detection of\u000a      crime.\u000a    The key advance at Royal Holloway that led to the impact described in\u000a      this case was to devise a totally new approach for the analysis of CCTV\u000a      footage, based on algorithms which mimic the human visual system (HVS).\u000a      This was inspired by the near perfect ability of the HVS to detect and\u000a      track moving objects that we are all familiar with. Reverse engineering\u000a      the HVS resulted in a new paradigm that differs fundamentally from\u000a      conventional approaches, and achieves major improvements in efficiency and\u000a      speed. Prior video analytics techniques were based on simple motion\u000a      detection; they detect when groups of pixels change and use the size of\u000a      the group as the key characteristic to distinguish between frames. This\u000a      primitive approach produces limited and unreliable search results. The\u000a      background modelling paradigm struggles with signal-to-noise fluctuations\u000a      and changes of shape of moving objects make them difficult to track.\u000a    In the new approach initial detection of moving objects was achieved\u000a      using a new motion distillation paradigm, which employs spatio-temporal\u000a      wavelet decomposition of video. It was demonstrated that this method is\u000a      more robust than traditional background modelling techniques, while being\u000a      computationally less expensive. As with the HVS, the approach uses a dual\u000a      channel tracking architecture. The motion channel, generated through\u000a      motion distillation, handles object detection and initialises tracking.\u000a      The form channel is used to resolve tracking ambiguities and occlusions. A\u000a      new approach was also made to the analysis of human behaviour in the\u000a      footage. Objects were characterised into vehicles, pedestrians, runners,\u000a      groups, and unknown.\u000a    The research at RHUL [1-6] which formed the basis of Sugrue's PhD, led to\u000a      a licensing agreement between Royal Holloway and Amideon Systems Ltd (a\u000a      company providing electronic solutions to the aerospace and civil security\u000a      sectors) in March 2008. Amideon evaluated the performance of the code\u000a      using real-world CCTV footage, which had not been available at Royal\u000a      Holloway. The initial investigation using the low quality, low frame rate\u000a      footage typical of most security CCTV capture was unsuccessful. Sugrue,\u000a      informed by these challenges and building on the principles of the\u000a      original Human Visual System inspired algorithm, and the knowledge and\u000a      experience gained at Royal Holloway, developed a new successful\u000a      proof-of-concept product that was now able to deal with real CCTV footage.\u000a    In late 2009, Sugrue and his business partner Sarah Doyle formed\u000a      Kinesense Ltd and worked closely with the Irish Police (An Garda S&#237;och&#225;na)\u000a      during 2010 to turn the initial proof-of-concept into a functioning\u000a      real-world product. Kinesense has attracted &#8364;820,000 investment from\u000a      private investors, venture capitalists and Enterprise Ireland's High\u000a      Potential Start-Up (HPSU) funding programme. The product was launched in\u000a      the UK in 2011 and is now in use by 20% of UK police forces, helping solve\u000a      hundreds of serious crimes.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30401","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The development, at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of\u000a      Cambridge, of both MBE\u000a      growth techniques for structures containing quantum dots and suitable\u000a      device fabrication\u000a      technology has led to a long-term collaboration between the University and\u000a      Toshiba Research\u000a      Europe Ltd based at the Cambridge Science Park. This has been in place\u000a      since 1999.\u000a    As a consequence of the work carried out at the Cavendish, Toshiba has\u000a      invested heavily in\u000a      research and development in this area. The Deputy Managing Director,\u000a      Cambridge Research\u000a      Laboratory, Toshiba [18], writes, \"We have been particularly influenced by\u000a      research on the growth\u000a      and fabrication of quantum dot devices, by Professor Ritchie and\u000a      colleagues in the Semiconductor\u000a      Physics Group. In collaboration with Professor Ritchie, our researchers\u000a      have pursued a R&amp;D\u000a      programme on quantum photonic sources and detectors based on semiconductor\u000a      quantum dots.\u000a      This resulted in the creation of the Quantum Information Group at TREL\u000a      [Toshiba Research\u000a      Europe Ltd], to explore the applications of quantum devices to IT\u000a      systems.\" The programme\u000a      continues to the current time with the aim of producing small-scale\u000a      devices using conventional\u000a      semiconductor technology at a low-cost to fit into quantum information\u000a      systems.\u000a    The demonstration of telecom-wavelength quantum-dot single-photon sources\u000a      which allow the\u000a      secure transmission of quantum keys further than attenuated lasers [3] has\u000a      stimulated the\u000a      development of Toshiba quantum key distribution systems [8] which although\u000a      currently using lasers\u000a      will in the future incorporate quantum dot sources when those sources have\u000a      been optimised. The\u000a      Toshiba quantum key distribution system was demonstrated in Vienna in 2008\u000a      as part of the\u000a      SECOQC collaboration of which both the University of Cambridge (Ritchie)\u000a      and Toshiba were\u000a      members. [10] The QKD system was also operational in Tokyo in 2010, where\u000a      secure key\u000a      generation was demonstrated for a 24 hour period over a 45km link. [11] .\u000a      The global market for\u000a      QKD has been predicted as $1B by 2018 in a recent market report [9] which\u000a      refers to Toshiba as a\u000a      \"Key Player\". By then Quantum LEDs may show a performance advantage over\u000a      attenuated lasers\u000a      and allow higher secure bit rates.\u000a    Through the work with the Cavendish, Toshiba Research Europe has been\u000a      able to create a\u000a      scalable semiconductor device based on quantum dots grown in an optical\u000a      cavity that emits single\u000a      photons at a wavelength suitable for optical-fibre transmission. As\u000a      indicated above, one advantage\u000a      of quantum dots is that they emit single or entangled photons, in response\u000a      to an electrical pulse, on\u000a      demand &#8212; unlike nonlinear crystals used to create entangled photon paris,\u000a      which emit photons\u000a      probabilistically. The development of such inexpensive chips, hosting\u000a      millions of such devices,\u000a      each addressed by an electrical control signal, is intended to be used in\u000a      linear optical computing\u000a      schemes. As a consequence of the joint demonstration of entangled-photon\u000a      LEDs [6] Toshiba are\u000a      now developing quantum teleportation and quantum repeater technology.\u000a    As well as having an impact on Toshiba, this research has had an impact\u000a      on the wider community\u000a      through the conventional media such as newspapers, magazines and the BBC\u000a      as well as an\u000a      exhibit at the 2013 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition. [12]\u000a    Following on from the SECOQC project the industrial interest in the\u000a      technology is evidenced by a\u000a      large consortium of companies working together to produce industrial\u000a      standards for quantum dot\u000a      based single-photon sources (such as those developed in [2]) under the\u000a      auspices of ETSI, the\u000a      European Telecommunications Standards Institute. [13]. The QKD Industrial\u000a      Standardisation\u000a      Group involves 9 private companies and 5 government bodies. [14]. Their\u000a      work has included the\u000a      definition of standard measures and test procedures for the single photon\u000a      devices developed in the\u000a      collaboration.\u000a    This research has stimulated the national measurement Institutes to\u000a      establish substantial\u000a      programmes to develop standard tests for quantum light sources and\u000a      detectors with the National\u000a      Physical Laboratory involved in one such collaborative project with the\u000a      University and Toshiba.\u000a      Similar programmes are underway in the US, Japan, Germany and Italy.\u000a    This research has influenced the policy of national science and\u000a      technology organisations. For\u000a      example the Institute of Physics have identified Quantum Information\u000a      Technology as important\u000a      area of research in the UK, in part due to the work done in the\u000a      collaboration at Cambridge [15].\u000a      Work on single and entangled-photon sources was featured in a publication\u000a      from 2011 including\u000a      an illustration on the front cover of an entangled-photon source\u000a      fabricated at the Cavendish\u000a      Laboratory and drawn by Robert Young, a University of Cambridge PhD\u000a      student. [15] The EPSRC\u000a      have identified quantum technologies as one of their \"Grand Challenges\"\u000a      and currently prioritise\u000a      funding in this area. [16]. Quantum communications has also been a\u000a      priority in framework\u000a      programmes of the EU.\u000a    This research has also had a considerable impact upon government policy.\u000a      In Japan there is a\u000a      large industry-led \"Secure Photonic Technology\" initiative to promote\u000a      quantum communication. [17]\u000a      This initiative is funded by the National Institute of Communication and\u000a      Information Technology\u000a      (NICT) and Toshiba's laboratory in Cambridge is a participant. This\u000a      initiative involves the\u000a      development of both single photon quantum cryptography, as well as quantum\u000a      dot based quantum\u000a      repeaters and in part builds on collaborative research performed in\u000a      Cambridge.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The development of Molecular Beam Epitaxial (MBE) growth techniques for\u000a      self-assembled\u000a      quantum dots at Cambridge University has led to the creation of\u000a      electrically driven, compact single-photon\u000a      and entangled-photon sources, and their demonstration in quantum key\u000a      distribution (QKD)\u000a      systems.

Previous work had demonstrated single photon generation using\u000a      atoms, the\u000a      breakthrough here was to use InAs quantum dots as `artificial atoms',\u000a      inside conventional\u000a      semiconductor devices to realise more compact and robust single photon\u000a      generators. In 2002 the\u000a      collaboration made the first single photon source (in any system) driven\u000a      by an applied voltage, the\u000a      Single-Photon Light Emitting Diode (LED), which removes the\u000a      complexity and cost of optical\u000a      pumping with ultra-short laser pulses.[2] In this and the subsequent\u000a      research, the MBE growth and\u000a      device fabrication took place at the Cavendish Laboratory with optical\u000a      measurement taking place at\u000a      Toshiba.\u000a    Another important development was to extend the quantum dot emission\u000a      wavelength to a\u000a      transmission band of optical fibre, which was achieved by optimising the\u000a      size and composition of\u000a      the quantum dot. This telecom wavelength single-photon source was then\u000a      applied to quantum key\u000a      distribution (QKD) demonstrating that a secure key could be transmitted\u000a      further than with weak\u000a      coherent pulses from a laser.[3]\u000a    Most of the advanced applications in quantum information technology\u000a      require photons that are\u000a      indistinguishable from one another and can therefore undergo two-photon\u000a      interference. However,\u000a      unlike atoms, quantum dots display a spectrum of emission energies due to\u000a      unavoidable variations\u000a      in their size, shape and composition, which prevents interference of\u000a      photons from different\u000a      sources. For many years this was thought to be a fundamental barrier to\u000a      using quantum dot\u000a      sources in quantum communications and quantum computing schemes. The\u000a      collaboration showed\u000a      that a single photon source consisting of an InAs quantum dot situated\u000a      between AlGaAs barriers\u000a      can be tuned significantly by an applied electric field, and thereby\u000a      demonstrated the\u000a      indistinguishability of photons from different LEDs for the first time.[4]\u000a    Long distance quantum communications requires sources of photon pairs\u000a      which have quantum\u000a      mechanically entangled properties. In 2006 the collaboration demonstrated\u000a      for the first time that\u000a      semiconductor quantum dots can produce polarisation entangled photons.\u000a      [5]. This was achieved\u000a      by tailoring the nanostructure of the quantum dot to erase which-path\u000a      information in the biexciton\u000a      cascade of the quantum dot. In 2010 the first entangled light emitting\u000a      diode was demonstrated.[6]\u000a      This simple semiconductor device could enable the development of\u000a      applications for quantum\u000a      entanglement, in much the same way as the laser diode stimulated today's\u000a      photonics industry.\u000a      Most recently the collaboration has shown that entangled LEDs can be used\u000a      for quantum\u000a      teleportation, the key protocol for transferring quantum information in a\u000a      quantum network or\u000a      quantum computer.\u000a    In parallel with this work on quantum light sources, semiconductor\u000a      technologies have been applied\u000a      to quantum memories and quantum detectors. It was shown that the photon\u000a      polarisation can be\u000a      stored as the spin of an electron in a quantum dot and that field effect\u000a      transistors gated by a layer\u000a      of quantum dots can make highly efficient photon detectors. In addition, a\u000a      second type of single\u000a      photon detector based on an avalanche photodiode was used to demonstrate\u000a      Quantum Key\u000a      Distribution with a secure bit rate in excess of 1 Mbit\/sec for the first\u000a      time, the highest sustained bit\u000a      rate demonstrated to date.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31401","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The direct economic impact of the XMaS project has been through\u000a      the commercialisation of\u000a      intellectual property generated as part of the research infrastructure\u000a      developments that have\u000a      occurred as new advances in synchrotron based experiments have been\u000a      implemented.\u000a      Commercial licence agreements (currently 9 agreements for individual\u000a      instruments, shared\u000a      between Liverpool and Warwick) are held in partnership with Huber\u000a        Diffraktiontechnik GmbH &amp; Co,\u000a      which is a world leader in specialist x-ray equipment.

[2] The take-up of the XMaS-developed research\u000a      infrastructure enables enhanced\u000a      capability and capacity at synchrotron radiation facilities worldwide\u000a      through increased efficiency of\u000a      experimental procedure. This can have significant cost saving benefits as\u000a      experiments cost &gt;&#163;10k\u000a      per day. For example, one of the biggest sellers, the XYZ cryostat mount,\u000a      has enabled large\u000a      efficiency gains to be realised (up to 20% of measurement time saved) by\u000a      allowing motorised\u000a      repositioning of the sample). [3].\u000a    The second type of impact generated by XMaS arises from knowledge\u000a        transfer through the\u000a        provision of trained specialists and know-how. The demand for\u000a      synchrotron radiation extends\u000a      well beyond the academic community to industry and government\u000a      organisations. This means that\u000a      the latest generation of machines are currently being built while existing\u000a      machines are upgraded to\u000a      provide more flexible experimental stations. This leads to a requirement\u000a      for sophisticated\u000a      instrumentation to improve the efficiency of SR experiments in a wide\u000a      range of scientific fields, and\u000a      for trained specialists for this industry.\u000a    Since the XMaS project has been running, several new synchrotron\u000a      facilities have been built or\u000a      upgraded. Through knowledge transfer and direct interaction with these\u000a      facilities, which include the\u000a      LNLS in Brazil and the UK Diamond Light Source (DLS) facility, we have\u000a      enabled commercial\u000a      projects to be completed more efficiently and cost effectively. This was\u000a      typified by the joint\u000a      appointment of a post-doctoral researcher who worked on XMaS for two years\u000a      before transferring\u000a      to DLS [4]. Examples of exchange of processes include installation of an\u000a      electric-field capability\u000a      developed with NPL at DLS and, more recently, the Swiss Light Source have\u000a      implemented our\u000a      methods for controlling the incident polarisation. In conjunction with\u000a      commercial partners, such as\u000a      NPL and DLS, we co-host, sponsor and run specialist meetings and\u000a      workshops. A series of\u000a      meetings co-hosted by the NPL led to the development of a new web resource\u000a      detailing metrology\u000a      standards for electrical measurement. [5] The success of this endeavour\u000a      resulted in XMaS and\u000a      NPL collaborating as partners in the EURAMET-EMRP project which brings the\u000a      premier European\u000a      metrology labs together with commercial partners such as IBM, New York.\u000a      [6]\u000a    The XMaS project has a commitment to provide the next generation of\u000a      material scientists that have\u000a      specialist expertise in advanced synchrotron radiation techniques. As well\u000a      as contributing directly\u000a      to the running of synchrotron facilities, the diverse range of people\u000a      trained on XMaS have\u000a      transferred their knowledge and experience to their current roles that\u000a      span industry, other large\u000a      scale scientific facilities and education in schools. Since 2008, more\u000a      than 50 post-doctoral and 150\u000a      postgraduate researchers have been trained on the beamline. In addition to\u000a      those now in academic\u000a      posts, many of these researchers currently work at central facilities\u000a      worldwide with 15 working at\u000a      the UK national x-ray (DLS) and neutron (ISIS) centres.

To maximise impact in actinide materials it was\u000a      identified that the higher flux and\u000a      overall beam characteristics of a third generation source were required\u000a      and so the facility should\u000a      be based at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).\u000a    An EPSRC award was made to Professor Stirling (University of Liverpool)\u000a      and Professor Cooper\u000a      (University of Warwick) to design, build and commission a flexible\u000a      beamline to exploit an x-ray\u000a      energy window between 3 and 20 keV. The design consisted of a non-magnetic\u000a      six circle\u000a      diffractometer with a standard suite of sample environments and detectors\u000a      suitable for exploiting\u000a      the high flux and beam polarisation to study magnetic materials. The\u000a      design of the optical\u000a      components (mirrors and monochromator) as well as any air-paths was\u000a      optimised for low energy\u000a      XRMS operations to facilitate actinide studies. As the polarisation of the\u000a      incident beam is a critical\u000a      parameter for the study of ferromagnetic materials, it was quantified\u000a      during the early build phase by\u000a      measuring the ratio of magnetic to charge form factors of nickel. These\u000a      measurements showed\u000a      that the design and beamline characteristics were suitable for studies of\u000a      a wide range of magnetic\u000a      materials [1]. This beamline facility is known by the acronym XMaS (X-ray\u000a      Magnetic Scattering).\u000a    Due to the robust and flexible design of the beamline described above,\u000a      the user community\u000a      (including Liverpool academics Lucas and Stirling) expanded rapidly to\u000a      include new scientific areas\u000a      and challenges beyond actinide magnetism. These experiments used the\u000a      beamline in different\u000a      ways and highlighted areas that could be optimised and made more efficient\u000a      through better control\u000a      of the sample position and slit defined beam paths.\u000a    This led to a research and development programme involving University of\u000a      Liverpool research\u000a      staff (Brown, Thompson, Bouchenoire, Kervin) and Liverpool academics\u000a      (Lucas, Stirling) to design,\u000a      develop, test and commission new components for performing diffraction\u000a      experiments. These\u000a      developments have been published in a series of articles in peer-reviewed\u000a      journals [1-5].\u000a    These include the development of \"tube slits\" for reducing background and\u000a      the XYZ cryostat mount\u000a      for highly accurate and efficient sample positioning during \"beam-on\"\u000a      conditions [2]. New sample\u000a      environments such as magnetic fields (1 T electromagnet and 4 T\u000a      superconducting magnet), wet\u000a      chemical cells [3] and the ability to apply electric fields at low\u000a      temperatures (1 K) were also\u000a      designed, completing phase II (2002-7) of the XMaS project.\u000a    In XMaS Phase III (2007-12), it was investigated how the operational\u000a      energy could be lowered to\u000a      2.3 keV. This involved developing and researching new evacuated sample\u000a      environments, thinner\u000a      Be windows and new detectors. For the first time, attenuators compatible\u000a      with UHV operation had\u000a      to be developed to overcome absorption problems [4]. New methods for\u000a      controlling the incoming\u000a      polarisation of the beam, back compatible with previous developments, were\u000a      also required.\u000a      Through the development of the phase plate and subsequent development of\u000a      the PE loop system\u000a      on XMaS, a strong collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory\u000a      (NPL) was formed [5]. As a\u000a      result of this collaboration, Liverpool is now a project partner with NPL\u000a      on a European Metrology\u000a      Research Programme to study novel electronic devices based on control of\u000a      strain at the nanoscale\u000a      in multiferroic and ferroelectric materials.\u000a    The continual developments throughout the XMaS project now mean that it\u000a      is a facility for the study\u000a      of a broad range of material science. The collaborative project is\u000a      on-going having been refunded\u000a      recently as an EPSRC mid-range facility allowing continuation of research\u000a      on new capabilities and\u000a      projects [6].\u000a    The XMaS beamline is jointly managed and operated by the Universities of\u000a      Liverpool and Warwick.\u000a      Staff on the project from the Department of Physics at the University of\u000a      Liverpool are: Project\u000a      Directors; W.

This has been particularly true for MSL,\u000a      where the company Director writes in his supporting letter that their\u000a      collaboration with Liverpool \"...has proven and continues to be, of\u000a        great benefit to expanding commercial activities, particularly in\u000a        Asia...\" On radiation-hard developments such as n-in-p, introduction\u000a      of interstitial oxygen, and guard-ring optimisation for post-irradiation\u000a      high-voltage operation, he writes: \"Since 2008, the establishment of\u000a        P-type substrate technology, which has relied on MSL fabrication and\u000a        process engineers working closely with Liverpool's device expertise, has\u000a        established MSL's pixel and strip offerings as the most\u000a        radiation-tolerant in the world.

With CNM, we also provide the\u000a      mask designs for the different prototype devices developed for studies of\u000a      performance after extreme neutron and proton irradiation.\u000a    We helped e2v develop this technology with Liverpool mask designs through\u000a      a joint industry-academia grant (ST\/F011571\/1 with &#163;327k to Liverpool)\u000a      leading a joint publication with e2v.

Dr Walsh does all the company's in-house sensor design.\u000a    Other Impact\u000a    The building of the LHCb n-in-p VELO 2008-2012 was done based on the\u000a      n-in-p research, but required electronics expertise across a broad range\u000a      of UK industry including Hawk Electronics and Stevenage Circuits. The\u000a      technologies developed that were ancillary to the n-in-p sensors, but\u000a      nonetheless vital to completing the instrumentation, included the\u000a      precision, low-thermal impact component mounting by Hawk Electronics, who\u000a      won a NW Industry award for their work with Liverpool in 2008 and the\u000a      circuit layout and design by Liverpool of high-tech hybrids (that hold the\u000a      sensors) by Stevenage Circuits. On the back of this research, Hawk has now\u000a      been enabled to bid for EC contracts and Stevenage Circuits has added\u000a      thermal management to part of its product range of hybrids. Both are\u000a      involved heavily in the ATLAS tracker upgrade prototyping efforts for the\u000a      HL-LHC at Liverpool with the prospect for bidding for major future\u000a      contracts.\u000a    The detectors designed by Liverpool for the LHC now form the basis of a\u000a      major new initiative in proton therapy instrumentation which recently\u000a      received a &#163;1.6 million Translation Award from the Wellcome Trust.

Based at CERN, the European centre for PP, its data\u000a      revealed the existence of the Higgs Boson, and allowed investigation of\u000a      matter and antimatter differences (\"CP violation\"), Dark Matter and other\u000a      phenomena that cannot be explained by our current understanding of PP, the\u000a      Standard Model (SM). Each of these topics is of outstanding importance to\u000a      our knowledge of fundamental physics. Four main experiments are based at\u000a      the LHC; ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE. The Liverpool PP group are and have\u000a      been members of the 600-strong LHCb and 3000-strong ATLAS collaborations\u000a      during the REF qualifying period.\u000a    Tara Shears created and led the SM Electroweak Physics Group on the LHCb\u000a      experiment (2008- 2012), where she convenes the physics working group\u000a      covering Quantum Chromodynamics, Electroweak and Beyond the SM analyses\u000a      (2012-2013). She is a convenor of the LHC Electroweak Working Group that\u000a      spans all LHC experimental and theoretical physicists (2011 onwards). She\u000a      leads the Liverpool LHCb group (2012 onwards). The group has research\u000a      interests spanning both SM (Shears) and CP violation physics (Hutchcroft).\u000a      The group constructed, commissioned and maintains the VELO particle\u000a      detector (Bowcock) which provides the data necessary to perform all LHCb\u000a      physics analyses. Notably, these include the first measurements of CP\u000a      violation in the charm (2012), and Bs meson sectors (2013), and\u000a      the first constraints on new physics made by observing rare B decays\u000a      (2012, 2013), which have all been extensively reported in the media.\u000a    Prior to joining LHCb in 2004, Tara studied the strong force and searched\u000a      for new physics on the Fermilab CDF experiment (2000 onwards) and worked\u000a      on the ATLAS experiment (2000-2004). Her work on ATLAS provided the first\u000a      electron, muon and photon trigger algorithms. These are used to amass the\u000a      data samples needed to discover and study the Higgs Boson, perform SM\u000a      tests and to search for new physics. The Liverpool PP group has a strong\u000a      involvement in ATLAS. The group assembled one semiconductor particle\u000a      detector endcap (Allport), and members play leading roles in the\u000a      revolutionary and widely publicised Higgs discovery (2012 - Mehta,\u000a      Vossebeld), SM tests (Klein M, Klein U, Kretzschmar) and Dark Matter\u000a      searches (D'Onofrio, Burdin, King, Maxfield).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32047","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Impact on Industry and Medicine and beyond.\u000d    Our research in applied accelerator technologies and particle\/target\u000d      interactions has been widely welcomed by the industrial and medical\u000d      sectors:\u000d    As a consequence of our research programmes and our approach to research,\u000d      Siemens AG has established a formal collaboration with Huddersfield, and\u000d      awarded our International Institute for Accelerator Applications (IIAA)\u000d      the status of Siemens Official Technology Partner. We continue to work\u000d      with Siemens on the broader applications of low energy proton accelerators\u000d      through two CASE studentships, through contracted research and through our\u000d      operation of a &#163;0.5M ion source provided by Siemens to the IIAA on\u000d      extended loan. While much of the work with and for Siemens is covered by\u000d      Non-Disclosure Agreements, one example in the public domain is our work on\u000d      alleviating the global 99mTc drought by exploring the\u000d      feasibility of low energy proton accelerator production of this and\u000d      alternative radioisotopes. We have demonstrated the potential of local\u000d      hospital based radioisotope production, and of the deployment of much\u000d      shorter lived isotopes for PET and SPECT, and even for cancer therapy,\u000d      thereby presenting new industrial routes to the reliable production and\u000d      deployment of medical radioisotopes.

Over 400 pan-European industrialists and politicians\u000d      attended to hear about the use of neutrons for materials research, about\u000d      how ESS will be built and the facility's impact on society, and\u000d      particularly about what neutrons can do for industrial R&amp;D, and the\u000d      potential for industrial engagement in the construction of ESS [D].\u000d    ESS will be a flagship of European science, comparable in stature to such\u000d      international facilities as CERN, ESRF and the Institut Laue Langevin. It\u000d      should be noted that \"...the impact of the University of Huddersfield's\u000d        research on the ESS project has been significant...\" : the ESS-PPP\u000d      in which \"...Cywinski played a leading and pivotal role, not only\u000d        helped to secure the decision to build ESS, but also the decision of\u000d        where in Europe it should be built...\".

News Focus in Science devoted two pages to EMMA in\u000d      2010 whilst the Engineer and Physics World discussed our ns-FFAG research\u000d      (in April and May 2011). In June 2011 The Mail on Sunday colour supplement\u000d      featured \"This is Emma.

Correspondingly reports of EMMA went global, with\u000d      the accelerator development featuring on Fox News in US, and featured in\u000d      Horizons Business on BBC World News with viewing figures approaching 100\u000d      million. In total there are over 32,800 Google hits referencing EMMA\u000d      alone.\u000d    We have also scripted and produced two broadcast quality and\u000d      copyright-free videos describing accelerators and their applications [H].\u000d      The first is a 25 minute educational animated documentary film about our\u000d      research carried out as part of the CONFORM project. Presented by\u000d      Professor Lord Robert Winston, the film raises public awareness of the\u000d      role of particle accelerators in science, technology and medicine, and the\u000d      construction of EMMA, at Daresbury Laboratory and covers the history of\u000d      accelerators, and ns-FFAG technology and its potential applications in\u000d      proton\/hadron cancer therapy. It has been watched approximately 4000 times\u000d      on youtube alone and over 1000 DVDs have been distributed to schools, the\u000d      press, politicians and the public across Europe.\u000d    In the second Sir Patrick Stewart presents an introduction to the\u000d      European Spallation Source, explaining that it is a major science facility\u000d      that will provide the world's most intense beams of neutrons to study\u000d      materials at the atomic level, probing deeply into materials with\u000d      unprecedented clarity. Sir Patrick explains how it will be one of the most\u000d      important research facilities in the world, enabling developments in drug\u000d      design, magnetic materials for data storage, ceramics for engineering,\u000d      biocompatible materials, hydrogen fuel and processes for capturing carbon.\u000d      The video is available on line and has been viewed over 32,000 times, and\u000d      over 500 DVDs have been distributed to politicians and journalists.\u000d    The CONFORM movie was invited to be exhibited at the International\u000d      Festival of Popular Science and Educational Films \"World of Knowledge\" in\u000d      St Petersburg, Russia in October 2011, whilst the ESS movie was one of ten\u000d      shortlisted for the US National Science Foundation's International Science\u000d      and Engineering Visualization Challenge in the same month. The ESS movie\u000d      was also shown and distributed at the ESS Industry Day meeting in\u000d      Copenhagen.\u000d    The press coverage and the videos have led directly to a remarkable\u000d      upsurge in public interest in our research, precipitating many requests\u000d      for public lectures, as described below.\u000d    Impact through outreach\u000d    Members of the group have a long history of activity in outreach and\u000d      public engagement with many different audiences and have brought this\u000d      experience to enhance the wider impact of this research Activities include\u000d      dozens of invited talks to 6th formers in schools; to adults at `Caf&#233;\u000d      Sci&#233;ntifique', SciBar, TEDx, and Philosophical Society events, and to\u000d      industrial networks such as the Nuclear Institute.

Huddersfield's involvement (from 2008) was\u000d      initially led by Prof Cywinski, the joint coordinator of the work package\u000d      investigating applications that this technology could open up in the\u000d      fields of healthcare, energy production, and materials studies. Prof\u000d      Edgecock, coordinator of the work package that built EMMA, the world's\u000d      first nsFFAG machine, and managed its first successful operation in 2011,\u000d      joined Huddersfield at 0.5FTE in 2010, whilst Prof Barlow, the Principal\u000d      Investigator of CONFORM project, joined Huddersfield in early 2011.\u000d    The nsFFAG brings together the fixed field and high duty cycle of a\u000d      cyclotron (but not its relativistic limitations) with the strong focussing\u000d      of a synchrotron, by using magnets whose field varies with position but\u000d      not with time. This field variation provides the focussing. In a\u000d      conventional (scaling) FFAG the beam optics does not change during\u000d      particle acceleration, which enables resonances to be avoided but severely\u000d      constrains the form of the field. Relaxing this constraint enables simpler\u000d      magnets and a smaller beam pipe to be deployed. We proposed that the\u000d      resonances would not destroy the beam as the rapid acceleration meant that\u000d      they are passed through quickly and this was verified with the first\u000d      acceleration in EMMA in 2011, and has been confirmed by EMMA's operation\u000d      since then [1].\u000d    Having proven nsFFAG technology we have thus opened the door to\u000d      development of cheap, simple and compact proton machine(s) providing\u000d      synchrotron energies at cyclotron currents, with simple magnets and low\u000d      losses. We are researching potential applications in medical physics for\u000d      proton and charged ion radiotherapy, for medical isotope production, and\u000d      for the production of muons and neutrons for boron neutron capture therapy\u000d      (BNCT), security and condensed matter studies.\u000d    (b) The exploitation and development of GEANT4 simulations of\u000d        particle-beam interactions Our expertise in GEANT4, a modern and\u000d      very general simulation code developed for particle physics, has enabled\u000d      us to explore, evaluate and optimise particle-target interactions and the\u000d      associated production of pions, muons, neutrons and radioisotopes, whilst\u000d      also extending the capabilities of GEANT4 to deliver reliable results at\u000d      significantly lower proton energies (&lt;20MeV). For example,\u000d      Siemens-funded research has led to models for accelerator-driven low\u000d      energy proton production of currently exploited and novel radioisotopes\u000d      for PET and SPECT medical imaging [2] and for optimised low energy neutron\u000d      production for BNCT. At higher proton energies we have made significant\u000d      progress in optimising the target material, geometry, and muon production\u000d      rates for the DAEdALUS project [3], for the ISIS muon facility [4], and\u000d      for stand-alone MuSR facilties now being considered for construction by\u000d      Fermilab and Brookhaven DOE laboratories.\u000d    (c) The development of the scientific and political case for the\u000d        European Spallation Source The major scientific, political and\u000d      socioeconomic impetus to build the 1.5b&#8364; ESS was provided by the EU FP7\u000d      ESS Preparatory Phase Project (2008 - 2010), which led to the\u000d      multinational decision to build ESS in Lund in Sweden. Huddersfield was\u000d      the only UK HEI participating in ESS-PPP and Cywinski played a major role\u000d      both leading and participating in a number of the ESS-PPP work packages.\u000d      Prof Seviour worked on RF sources, and was also editor of the ESS\u000d      Conceptual Design Report Accelerator chapter and lead member of the Cross\u000d      Functional Working Group on reliability of the whole ESS Facility.\u000d      Huddersfield's original involvement with neutron instrumentation and\u000d      general neutronics, has thus evolved to include the design of the target,\u000d      evaluation of induced radiation in the accelerator, and the accelerator\u000d      itself.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32049","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Impact on industry\u000d    At an early stage of Huddersfield's thorium research programme (2009)\u000d      Cywinski and Barlow created ThorEA, initially as the Thorium Energy\u000d      Amplifier Association, currently extended in scope to the Thorium Energy\u000d      Association. ThorEA is a learned, not-for-profit, society that brings\u000d      together academics, industrialists and politicians to discuss all aspects\u000d      of thorium deployment technologies. Meetings with 30-50 participants are\u000d      held twice annually at venues around the UK, often attracting overseas\u000d      attendance. Siemens, Jacobs E&amp;C Ltd, the Norwegian company Thor\u000d      Energy, NNL, and the Nuclear Institute have participated. As a result\u000d      Cywinski was invited to address the Nuclear Institute's Midlands, Cumbria\u000d      and North East branches, and in 2012 gave the NI North West R V Moore\u000d      memorial lecture. These interactions have showcased Huddersfield's\u000d      research and led to a publication with Thor Energy and Jacobs [6], with\u000d      the latter confirming that our research has \"...had an impact on our\u000d        own designs for the ADTRTM which won the\u000d        prestigious IChemE 2010 Innovations and Excellence Energy Award.\"\u000d      [A].\u000d    Impact on government and policy makers\u000d    Given the current position of the nuclear industry, the public and\u000d      governmental perception of that industry, and issues involved with the\u000d      scale of financing, licensing, and build time, it is clear that influence\u000d      on policy is a crucial first stage in exploiting our research.\u000d    Following ThorEA's inception in 2009 Science Minister Lord Drayson\u000d      requested a report on our research on thorium technology, defining the\u000d      financial investment necessary for the UK to deliver the enabling\u000d      technologies for the construction of a thorium-fuelled ADSR, whilst\u000d      additionally appraising the commercial opportunities arising for the UK.\u000d      The report [1], edited by Cywinski, showed that the technology would allow\u000d      the UK to compete aggressively in existing nuclear markets, open up new\u000d      nuclear markets, directly impact other high technology industries\u000d      including medicine and enable the UK to meet carbon reduction targets. The\u000d      Government left office before the report, delivered in late 2009, could be\u000d      acted upon. However the report has been recognised and supported by IAEA\u000d      as \"...a positive contribution to the international effort to secure\u000d        eventual global deployment of sustainable thorium fuelled ADSR power\u000d        generation systems.\" [1].\u000d    In 2013, under Cywinski's chairmanship, ThorEA was granted full\u000d      membership of Europe's Sustainable Nuclear Technology Platform &#8212; SNETP &#8212;\u000d      in recognition of its reputation for bringing academia and industry\u000d      together.\u000d    Our strong engagement with politicians and policy makers, for example\u000d      through the All Party Parliamentary Group on Thorium, has \"...significantly\u000d        informed the UK debate on clean, low carbon, but safer and more\u000d        sustainable, nuclear power.\" [B] whilst assisting \"...in DECC's\u000d        consideration of possible future scenarios for nuclear power\u000d        generation...\" [C]. We are also informing policy, as demonstrated by\u000d      the inclusion of the thorium fuel cycle in the recent Beddington Review\u000d      document \"Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap: Future\u000d      Pathways\" [D] recognising that thorium fuel could play a key role in the\u000d      future pathways to nuclear power in the UK and is worthy of further\u000d      research &#8212; a remarkable turnaround with respect to an earlier negative NNL\u000d      policy statement on thorium.\u000d    We have also interacted closely with the Weinberg Foundation (an NGO\u000d      operating from Somerset House) and its patron, Baroness Bryony Worthington\u000d      (Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Change) [B], since its launch in\u000d      2011. The WF recognise that our research has been \"...instrumental in\u000d        changing scientific, political and public opinions on thorium energy...\"\u000d      [E].\u000d    In the US our ADSR research on waste transmutation carried out in\u000d      collaboration with PAC has led to \"...a legislative bill in the\u000d        Illinois State General Assembly based on the Huddersfield-PAC ADS model\u000d        that would permit construction of a pilot plant to demonstrate this\u000d        approach to dealing with nuclear waste. This bill has passed out of\u000d        committee with bipartisan support and is now up for vote in the full\u000d        Illinois House of Representatives.\" [F].\u000d    Internationally, we are represented on the programme committee, alongside\u000d      Carlo Rubbia and Hans Blix, of the international thorium energy conference\u000d      THEC13. This conference series successfully brings together academics,\u000d      industrialists, politicians and policy makers. Huddersfield has given\u000d      invited lectures, and chaired sessions and discussion panels, at this and\u000d      previous THECs.\u000d    Media impact\u000d    Our research on thorium has generated significant media interest in\u000d      thorium, starting with The Times science supplement Eureka in October 2009\u000d      which featured our ADSR as one of the 15 projects researching technologies\u000d      of tomorrow which \".....promises to change the way we live for the\u000d        better......\".Since then Huddersfield's research has featured many\u000d      times in national newspapers including the Guardian, Telegraph, Financial\u000d      Times, a major colour supplement article in The Mail on Sunday [G] and\u000d      even featured in House and Garden (8\/2012). Internationally we have been\u000d      asked to write an editorial for The Australian and have been featured in\u000d      many international newspapers and blogs, always attracting tens and\u000d      sometimes hundreds of feedback comments. Our research has featured\u000d      prominently on the BBC [H]: in Radio 4's Material World\u000d      (15\/9\/2011), and \"Costing the Earth\" (29\/2\/2012), whilst on\u000d      television it featured in the pre-election Politics Show (April\u000d      2010), and other news items. BBC World's Horizons Business in 2013\u000d      broadcast a whole programme dedicated to Huddersfield's thorium ADSR work\u000d      (viewing figures ~100M). In October 2013 Cywinski was interviewed live on\u000d      Australian ABC News (reach 2M viewers). We are often asked for live\u000d      comment on nuclear issues on local BBC radio news programmes.\u000d    A Google search for Huddersfield and thorium generates 218,000 hits\u000d      linking to articles, blogs, comments, and interviews.\u000d    Public Engagement\u000d    We have given dozens of invited talks at Public Lectures, Caf&#233;\u000d      Scientifique, TEDx, Philosophical Society, Schools and other public events\u000d      across the UK, including an invited lecture at the British Science\u000d      Festival in September 2011 where we also partnered Jim Al-Khalili in a\u000d      public debate on nuclear power, and an invited appearance at Beacons Rock\u000d      Festival in August 2013. Each event has drawn audiences of between 50 and\u000d      200. Feedback at and from the presentations is always positive with each\u000d      presentation invariably leading to several new invitations to speak.\u000d    Finally, recognising how much our thorium research had attracted the\u000d      attention of the public and was impacting perceptions of the potential of\u000d      alternative nuclear power and waste management, the Science Museum in\u000d      London launched a 3 month exhibition in the Antenna Gallery in October\u000d      2012 dedicated entirely to our research programme. Visitor numbers\u000d      exceeded 775,000, and the associated Topic Zone stimulated 464 visitor\u000d      comments and an article in the Dutch Newspaper NRC Handelsblad\u000d      (22\/11\/2012) [I].\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The University of Huddersfield leads the UK in the development and\u000d      advocacy of the thorium nuclear fuel cycle as an alternative to the\u000d      uranium\/plutonium cycle.

They were joined by Prof Barlow and Dr C.Bungau in early\u000d      2011. Initially we developed an innovative thorium-fuelled Accelerator\u000d      Driven Subcritical Reactor (ADSR) based on thorium [1] and explored\u000d      methods of effecting the fertile to fissile conversion of thorium to\u000d      provide fuel for conventional reactors [2]. ADSRs have the potential to\u000d      fill the gap of carbon-free nuclear power stations with a safer, cheaper,\u000d      more sustainable form of nuclear power. Moreover, the significantly\u000d      greater neutron flux at energies &gt;2MeV provided by accelerator-driven\u000d      spallation allows ADSRs to transmute legacy actinide waste, burning it as\u000d      fuel and turning a liability into an asset.\u000d    Drawing upon the expertise in Huddersfield's International Institute for\u000d      Accelerator Applications we have carried out research on appropriate\u000d      proton drivers for ADSR systems, concluding that our newly demonstrated\u000d      non-scaling fixed field alternating gradient accelerator can provide the\u000d      required proton energies, currents, and reliability. The compact nature\u000d      (and hence reduced cost) of a nsFFAG enables multiple proton injection and\u000d      spallation to be considered, thereby mitigating against accelerator trips\u000d      and homogenising the spallation neutron density in the core. Cywinski and\u000d      colleagues have now secured a patent on the multiple injection principle\u000d      [3].\u000d    In parallel projects, molecular modelling has been carried out by\u000d      Cywinski and colleagues to confirm the physical stability, thermal\u000d      conductivity, expansion, and diffusion of thorium fuel in a reactor [4].\u000d      Cywinski has also collaborated with LPSC and CEA in Grenoble to measure\u000d      the mass and isotopic yields of the 233U(nth, f) reaction\u000d      using the Lohengrin spectrometer at ILL [5], producing the most complete\u000d      and accurate data to date on fission cross sections of 233U\u000d      (ie the fuel's fissile component resulting from neutron capture by fertile\u000d      232Th).\u000d    Since 2011 we have simulated the behaviour of reactor configurations\u000d      using the Monte Carlo MCNPX program. In order to confirm the accuracy of\u000d      the results they have been benchmarked against those from GEANT4. This is\u000d      a modern and very general simulation code originally developed for\u000d      particle physics but now finding many applications as it is much more\u000d      adaptable than MCNPX, particularly for complex geometries such as those of\u000d      an ADSR. As part of the research programme, C.Bungau has successfully\u000d      added several new classes to the GEANT4 simulation code which have allowed\u000d      the code to be used for nuclear reactor criticality calculations for the\u000d      first time. These modified codes greatly extend the capabilities of GEANT4\u000d      and will be made generally available.\u000d    As a part of our research programme we explored pathways to the\u000d      exploitation of thorium energy and the delivery of the relevant\u000d      technologies. These are reported in detail in \"Towards an Alternative\u000d        Nuclear Future: Capturing thorium-fuelled ADSR energy technology for\u000d        Britain\", a 71pp policy document prepared at the request of the\u000d      former Minister of Science, Lord Drayson in 2009 [1]. Here we showed that\u000d      it is possible, through a public\/private partnership, to realise thorium\u000d      ADSR technology by 2025 ahead of GEN IV. We also showed that ADSRs could\u000d      be cost competitive, with a complete 600 MW reactor (keff=0.985)\u000d      being of a comparable cost to a conventional system, whilst generating\u000d      costs would be ~&#163;3\/MWhr lower than that of a U fuelled system. Radiotoxic\u000d      waste production would be substantially less. These figures are similar to\u000d      the estimates made by Jacobs E&amp;C Ltd who, in collaboration, developed\u000d      a comparable system (the ADTR &#8482; ) [6].\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32734","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In early 2009, semiconductor researchers working within the School held\u000a      the first of a series of meetings with senior technologists at the e2v\u000a      facility in Lincoln to explore the strengthening of informal links between\u000a      the two groups, which date back over 20 years. e2v, a company with over\u000a      1500 employees and a turnover, in 2013, of &#163;200M, manufacture a wide range\u000a      of electronic devices including high-frequency oscillators, which exploit\u000a      the negative differential resistance arising from the Gunn effect in III-V\u000a      semiconductors. These devices, which are grown by MBE and fabricated using\u000a      semiconductor processing techniques in cleanrooms, are supplied to the\u000a      aerospace, military and automobile industrial sectors, mainly for use in\u000a      radar systems.\u000a    The interest within the School in strengthening links with e2v arose from\u000a      the growing research portfolio of theoretical and experimental studies of\u000a      high-frequency (&gt;100GHz) oscillators, which had been identified by our\u000a      semiconductor researchers as having the potential for commercial\u000a      exploitation. Within e2v, the motivating factors were: their common\u000a      interest in enhanced high-frequency devices; their strategic aim to\u000a      develop closer interactions with leading semiconductor research groups\u000a      with complementary interests; the new opportunities for collaboration\u000a      between Nottingham and e2v in the areas of nitride semiconductors,\u000a      resonant tunnelling, THz acoustics and device modelling.\u000a    The initial discussions subsequently expanded in scope to encompass not\u000a      only research collaborations, but also the relocation of the company's\u000a      microwave semiconductor facility from a site in Lincoln; the company were\u000a      at that time exploring options to re-locate their activity to a site with\u000a      higher-quality clean-room infrastructure. The infrastructure for\u000a      nanofabrication which the School has built up over the last 25 years (MBE\u000a      growth, nanofabrication, our extensive capability for electronic and\u000a      optoelectronic characterisation, and access to clean rooms and the\u000a      associated technical and research personnel) provided strong motivation\u000a      for e2v to move to Nottingham.\u000a    The discussions with e2v then followed a dual-track process, encompassing\u000a      both research collaboration and relocation. The initial focus of\u000a      collaborative research was on the adaption of the numerical techniques\u000a      described in Section 2, which were developed by Fromhold, to the\u000a      modelling of silicon p-i-n diodes. In our approach the whole device &#8212;\u000a      including the contacts, energy bands, and scattering processes &#8212; was\u000a      included in the model. This was of particular interest to e2v, and proved\u000a      crucial for obtaining quantitative agreement between the calculated and\u000a      measured device characteristics. In collaboration with e2v, Fromhold\u000a      modified his model so that it could be used to calculate electrical\u000a      characteristics of devices that are used by e2v in receiver-protection\u000a      systems.\u000a    This activity was initially supported through a successful application to\u000a      the EPSRC Knowledge Transfer Secondment (KTS) scheme (&#163;40k:\u000a      01\/11\/2010-30\/10\/2011) and, by the end of the funded period, software for\u000a      calculations of the static characteristics of the diodes had been\u000a      transferred to e2v who now use the package as part of their component\u000a      testing and quality control procedures. In a follow-up study supported by\u000a      a TSB Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) (&#163;194k: 36 months from autumn\u000a      2012; 50% funding from e2v) the simulation software is being extended to\u000a      include coupling to the electromagnetic environment (to model\u000a      high-frequency characteristics) and variation of material properties. The\u000a      market for systems which includes these components is worth close to &#163;3M\u000a      per year to e2v, and our collaborative work has promoted a shift of e2v's\u000a      investment priorities to include the development of in-house software to\u000a      simulate device characteristics.\u000a    In parallel, discussions on the relocation of e2v progressed to involve\u000a      their Board of Directors, and the University of Nottingham Management\u000a      Board, leading to the establishment of a formal collaboration. The\u000a      collaboration is based on three contracts spanning a 5-year period from\u000a      October 2010 with a commitment of &#163;1M from e2v [A], including an initial\u000a      capital investment of &#163;0.35M. These contracts cover: the construction of a\u000a      90 m2 purpose-built ISO Class 7 (Class 10000) manufacturing and\u000a      research cleanroom [B]; the lease of the cleanroom and additional office\u000a      space to e2v [C]; service and collaboration agreements [D] with the School\u000a      (Nottingham PI Mellor, Associate Professor in Physics). The latter\u000a      covers protection of intellectual property, access by e2v to School\u000a      facilities (workshops, another nanofabrication cleanroom, and plasma\u000a      deposition equipment, which e2v now use in their manufacturing processes),\u000a      and commits the partners to knowledge transfer collaboration. The\u000a      commitment of the School to this joint venture is evident through our\u000a      appointment of an Experimental Officer with expertise in commercial\u000a      semiconductor device manufacture to work with the e2v staff and build the\u000a      collaboration. In addition, a Hermes fellowship (a University-administered\u000a      scheme funded by the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) to support\u000a      innovation and business engagement) was awarded to Patan&#232; to work\u000a      with e2v on new sources and detectors of high-frequency (GHz-THz)\u000a      radiation based on semiconductor superlattices (see Grant (ii) in Section\u000a      3).\u000a    The e2v facility was completed in 2011 and has since been operated by two\u000a      senior e2v engineers. The physical relocation of e2v has led to an\u000a      acceleration of knowledge transfer to the company. In addition to the\u000a      general support provided through our infrastructure and expertise, we\u000a      highlight the growth of SiO2 layers by PECVD (as described in\u000a      Section 2) on 3-inch wafers. These wafers are used by e2v to manufacture\u000a      high-frequency oscillators, and the high quality of the oxide layers that\u000a      we developed for etch masks (see Section 2) proved critical in this\u000a      fabrication process. In addition we have used our experience in the\u000a      control of doping profiles to grow GaAs layers using MBE for e2v. These\u000a      layers were processed into varactor diodes used by e2v to tune\u000a      high-frequency circuitry. The e2v manufacturing activity, which draws\u000a      heavily on our research infrastructure, has been successfully embedded in\u000a      the School; sales of components manufactured in the facility since its\u000a      launch in 2011 amount to approximately &#163;7M (&#163;3M\/annum) [A].\u000a    The Group Chief Technology Officer of e2v has stated [E]:\u000a    `e2v made the decision to relocate our microwave semiconductor device\u000a        manufacturing facility to the School of Physics &amp; Astronomy at\u000a        Nottingham primarily because of the facilities, skills base and closely\u000a        aligned research interests. We were also attracted by the School's\u000a        excellent track record of research and its world leading expertise and\u000a        the synergy with e2v's long term ambitions. The success of this\u000a        initiative has already been demonstrated through the transfer of\u000a        modelling and processing techniques originally applied to fundamental\u000a        aspects of device physics to e2v's design and manufacturing processes.\u000a        Notably amongst these; the device simulation of p-i-n diodes, the\u000a        deposition of oxides used in our commercial production and the supply of\u000a        semiconductor layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).'\u000a    The e2v-Nottingham activities are supported by the Nottingham Steering\u000a      Group in Microwave Semiconductor Devices, established in 2010, with a\u000a      membership including senior e2v staff. At knowledge transfer meetings,\u000a      held 3 times a year, semiconductor researchers within the School present\u000a      their research and identify, in discussion with e2v, pathways to\u000a      exploitation. These meetings have led to changes, at Board level, of the\u000a      company strategy for high-frequency device manufacture and development. To\u000a      this end, e2v have identified and prioritised routes for translating our\u000a      research into new and improved products, as articulated in their Strategic\u000a      Action Plan (STRAP). The first priority of this road map was to develop\u000a      better sources and detectors of GHz and THz radiation, building on our\u000a      expertise in modelling and the growth of nitride semiconductors.\u000a    A further significant benefit to e2v of the new facility is the\u000a      mitigation of risk from import restrictions arising from the US\u000a      International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The company is\u000a      vulnerable to changes in these regulations and the new, Nottingham-based\u000a      facility provides additional flexibility for the company to access and\u000a      manufacture components from an ITAR free source [A]. e2v's Chief Engineer,\u000a      Microwave Semiconductor Devices confirms the strategic importance of their\u000a      link with Nottingham,\u000a    `I'm glad to report that the research at Nottingham has further guided\u000a        strategic thinking at board level, with regard to technology and product\u000a        road maps (including the company's STRAP). These collaborative\u000a        activities will open new markets and opportunities for us and\u000a        importantly will enable us to move up the supply chain and provide our\u000a        customers with solutions for systems. Of particular increasing\u000a        importance is our joint ability to provide new and novel compound\u000a        semiconductor technology and components from an ITAR free source.'\u000a      [A].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research on semiconductor materials and devices has led to the\u000a      establishment by e2v Technologies of a combined manufacturing, research\u000a      and development facility within the School of Physics and Astronomy.

Since 1993 there have been\u000a      wide-ranging fundamental and applied studies of the electronic and\u000a      optoelectronic properties of GaAs\/(AlGa)As heterostructures [1], magnetic\u000a      semiconductors such as (GaMn)As [2] and wide band-gap nitride\u000a      semiconductors [3]. Our materials research encompasses the growth of new\u000a      materials using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and also nanofabrication\u000a      technologies, such as electron beam lithography, plasma etching and\u000a      plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). These facilities are\u000a      used to grow customised semiconductor heterostructures, which may be\u000a      processed into prototype devices that are investigated both within the\u000a      School, and also by external collaborators. The focus is on measuring and\u000a      understanding the electronic, magnetic and optical properties of the\u000a      devices. Condensed matter theorists within the School work in\u000a      collaboration with experimentalists to develop models and theories to\u000a      explain newly-observed phenomena in quantum transport, optics and device\u000a      physics. Since 1993 this activity has been supported through an overall\u000a      investment of ~&#163;50M from the research councils, the University and HEFCE\u000a      infrastructure funding. We include selected grants in Section 3.\u000a    A longstanding theme of our research on carrier transport in\u000a      semiconductors relates to devices which exhibit negative differential\u000a      conductance, an effect that underpins the operation of high-frequency\u000a      (&gt;100 GHz) oscillators. Our integrated programmes of experiment and\u000a      theory, with complementary device modelling, enabled us to observe and\u000a      understand these phenomena in both double-barrier resonant tunnelling\u000a      diodes and superlattices. Our expertise in the growth and modelling of\u000a      devices with negative differential conductance was a key factor in the\u000a      decision of e2v to relocate their high-frequency research, development and\u000a      manufacturing facility to the School and we describe below two sub-areas\u000a      of particular relevance:\u000a    &#8226; Simulations of carrier transport in superlattices and quantum well\u000a        structures\u000a    We have explored the dynamics of electrons in resonant tunnelling diodes\u000a      and semiconductor superlattices which exhibit negative differential\u000a      conductance and, hence, can sustain high-frequency current oscillations\u000a      [4,5]. Our experimental studies were complemented by computer simulations\u000a      of the current-voltage and current-time dependences of these devices.\u000a      These calculations provide self-consistent solutions of the\u000a      drift-diffusion equations, which must be treated numerically in this\u000a      regime since the engineered band structure gives rise to complex\u000a      energy-momentum carrier dispersion. We have applied this modelling to a\u000a      wide range of superlattices and resonant tunnelling diodes, and found that\u000a      a full treatment of contacts, often neglected in quantum transport\u000a      studies, is necessary to understand our experimental results, and relate\u000a      them to the composition of the structures, including the layer parameters,\u000a      materials, and doping profiles.\u000a    Our computer simulations of the spatio-temporal electron dynamics in\u000a      superlattices enabled us to predict, and confirm in experiment, that both\u000a      the amplitude and frequency of the current oscillations can be enhanced by\u000a      applying electromagnetic signals to tailor the dependence of electron\u000a      drift-velocity on electric field [4,5]. This area of research is of\u000a      particular relevance to e2v.\u000a    &#8226; Growth and processing of semiconductor devices\u000a    The growth and processing of semiconductor devices form an integral part\u000a      of our semiconductor activity. Since 1993 we have developed many processes\u000a      to optimise device design to enable the investigation of device physics. A\u000a      relevant example involved the development of a high degree of control in\u000a      the doping of MBE-grown GaAs heterostructures, which enabled the study of\u000a      single donor impurities and their influence on device characteristics [6].\u000a      This work started in the mid-1990s and was subsequently extended to\u000a      include the transport [1] and optical properties of single self-assembled\u000a      quantum dots. In a second, more recent, example, we have grown\u000a      high-quality SiO2layers which are deposited by PECVD and have\u000a      been used in our research programme as etch masks for the fabrication of\u000a      wide band-gap nitride semiconductors [3]. Both these processes have been\u000a      used to grow and process materials for e2v as part of their\u000a      Nottingham-based manufacturing process, as we describe in Section 4.\u000a    The staff involved in this research are listed below together with their\u000a      area of expertise:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Novikov, Foxon\u000a          MBE growth of nitride semiconductors\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Henini, Campion\u000a          MBE growth of GaAs\/(AlGa)As structures\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Eaves, Patan&#232;, Makarovsky\u000a          Low temperature magnetotransport\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Mellor\u000a          Nanofabrication\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Fromhold\u000a          Theory and modelling of device physics\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Kent, Akimov\u000a          Ultrafast optical measurements\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32735","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders affect a significant\u000a      proportion of the population. For instance gastro-oesophageal reflux\u000a      disease (GORD), the main symptom of which is heartburn, is experienced by\u000a      ~40% of the population in Western countries. Chronic sufferers (10-15%)\u000a      can develop more serious conditions such as Barrett's oesophagus and\u000a      erosive oesophagitis. GI disorders cost the UK economy &#163;7.2 billion\/year\u000a      and the NHS &gt; &#163;2.2 billion\/year [`Care of Patients with\u000a        Gastrointestinal Disorders in the United Kingdom', British Society\u000a      of Gastroenterology, March 2006]. Furthermore, the GI functional response\u000a      also modulates behavioural responses to food and, hence, is key to\u000a      designing meals and foodstuffs that increase satiation after a meal, which\u000a      can play a part in controlling the increasing rate of obesity in the\u000a      population. Health problems associated with being overweight cost the NHS\u000a      more than &#163;5 billion\/year [`Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A call to\u000a        action on obesity in England', HM Government, October 2011]. Despite\u000a      the importance of GI function in health and disease, until recently there\u000a      have been very few techniques available to investigate the physiology of\u000a      the GI tract repeatedly and non-invasively. The fast MRI methods that we\u000a      describe in Section 2 overcome the effects of movement in the human\u000a      abdomen, allowing the direct measurement of GI function in vivo.\u000a    Our work has influenced wider society through two principal routes:\u000a      product development in the food and drug industry; and the commercial\u000a      development of an in vitro model of the gut. In addition we have\u000a      contributed to television\/online programmes related to public health and\u000a      nutrition. We now consider knowledge transfer into these areas in turn:\u000a    &#8226; Product development in the food and drug industry\u000a    Our demonstration that gastrointestinal motility and flow, together with\u000a      a range of digestive processes, could be monitored directly in human\u000a      subjects attracted the interest of companies who were seeking to optimise\u000a      meal and drug formulations, and has led to funding from major\u000a      multinational companies including Proctor and Gamble, Mitsubishi\u000a      Chemicals, Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, Glaxo and McNeil Nutritionals.\u000a      Detailed information about how the data obtained in many of these trials\u000a      were used by the companies in product development remains confidential (in\u000a      most cases even to the Nottingham researchers involved). However, the\u000a      value of these studies to the relevant organisations can be gauged by the\u000a      rapid increase in the value of research contracts which they placed with\u000a      the Nottingham MRI group. In the period up to 2008 the commercial\u000a      contracts averaged ~&#163;44.5k\/annum; since 2008 this annual funding level has\u000a      more than trebled to &#163;135k\/annum, totalling &#163;678k (2008-2013).\u000a    We consider two examples of how our research influenced companies and\u000a      products. Firstly, an investigation funded by Reckitt and Colman (now\u000a      Reckitt Benckiser) [iii; 1999-2000] showed that `Gaviscon Advance'\u000a      was more efficacious at forming an alginate raft within the stomach,\u000a      preventing oesophageal reflux with only half the dose of normal Gaviscon.\u000a      The visual detail (Fig. 1), which is taken from our paper [6], was\u000a      reproduced by Reckitt Benckiser in their \"Gaviscon Advance 2006\u000a        campaign\" to promote the medicine by informing general\u000a      practitioners, and to substantiate claims regarding the health benefits of\u000a      Gaviscon Advance (GA) ([A]; see also [6]).\u000a\u000aFigure 1: 3D MRI reconstruction\u000aof a Gaviscon Advance raft and\u000aunderlying meal (NB: This figure is\u000afrom [6] and is also used in [A]).\u000a    \u000a\u0009To quantify the on-going impact of the development of this product\u000a      through the assessment period (2008 onwards) we estimate that NHS patients\u000a      benefitted from 14.6M prescriptions of GA (2008-2012 [B]; these figures do\u000a      not include over-the-counter sales). We present this as a prime example of\u000a      how our expertise and facilities are being used to understand and improve\u000a      the mode of action of products, and to substantiate claims about foods or\u000a      drugs, with the ultimate beneficiaries being patient groups world-wide.\u000a    Secondly, we highlight a long-term collaboration with Unilever aimed at\u000a      developing functional foods. This collaboration was built on the\u000a      application of our methods to: studies of the fate of different components\u000a      of a meal in the GI tract; the testing of prototype Unilever products; and\u000a      an investigation of GI physiology relevant to Unilever's current and\u000a      future product range. This relationship has led to support for 2 BBSRC\u000a      CASE studentship awards and contract research funding worth &#163;273k to our\u000a      group since 2008. In describing this work, the Strategic Science Group\u000a      Director Advanced Measurement in Unilever has stated [C]:\u000a    \"One particular example that was critical to a full product\u000a        development cycle included the collaboration with, Dr Harry Peters'\u000a        (R&amp;D Manager, Unilever, Vlaardingen) and included research findings\u000a        from a c&#163;250k Unilever commission project (2004-2007). The quality of\u000a        the MRI data and expert interpretation greatly increased prototype\u000a        efficiency whilst reducing related costs. The obvious benefit to the\u000a        company has been quicker time to market with reduced overheads, stronger\u000a        data package in support of claims and authority whilst maintaining\u000a        product quality and excellence for our customers.\u000a    This success catalysed 5 further studies with Nottingham between\u000a        2008-2013, including two CASE studentships. It is worth noting new\u000a        mechanistic and hence scientific insights into gastric processing were\u000a        delivered in the stomach, and both the small and large colon as a result\u000a        of aspects of these studies. In this particular field alone Dr Pip\u000a        Rayment (Unilever Colworth) has generated 6 patents.......\".\u000a    These successes in MRI were instrumental in the decision by Unilever to\u000a      enter into a strategic partnership with the University of Nottingham\u000a      across all subject areas. The relationship with Unilever provides clear\u000a      evidence of a multinational organisation making changes in its strategies\u000a      for research and product development as a consequence of our research.\u000a    &#8226; Commercial development of an in vitro model\u000a        of the gut\u000a    The costs, difficulties and lengthy time-scales associated with in\u000a        vivo studies of the gut have motivated the development of an in\u000a        vitro model. Researchers from the Institute of Food Research (IFR)\u000a      in Norwich worked with us on a project funded by joint BBSRC grants\u000a      (2005-06) [i], in which our research provided comparative data for the\u000a      development and certification of the Dynamic Gut Model (DGM) [D]. This in\u000a        vitro model is a machine which replicates the grinding forces and\u000a      the slow rate of intra-gastric mixing of viscous meals that we measured in\u000a        vivo, which is important since it determines the rate at which a\u000a      product is exposed to the low pH of the gastric secretions.\u000a    Plant Bioscience Limited (PBL; a technology management company), the\u000a      owners of the DGM intellectual property, successfully patented the machine\u000a      in the EU (EP1907108B1), USA (US8092222) and Australia (AU2006271423). The\u000a      role of Nottingham research, including in the protection of intellectual\u000a      property, is confirmed by the PBL Business Development Manager [E],\u000a    \"Nottingham's MRI group provided world leading research facilities and\u000a        expertise that provided critical underpinning to the design and\u000a        development of the DGM, and played a significant role both in\u000a        establishing IP protection and marketing evidence.\"\u000a    The DGM has proven to be an ideal vehicle to study the dynamics of oral\u000a      drug release, and has been widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry\u000a      to help develop and refine new formulations without the risk and expense\u000a      of human trials. PBL initially (Nov 2006) offered a fee-for-service from\u000a      their established business unit Model Gut. More recently (Feb\u000a      2013) they have licenced the technology and contract research business to\u000a      Bioneer Farma, a Danish company. In parallel, PBL have also secured over\u000a      &#163;900k follow-on funding from BBSRC for further development of the DGM [F].\u000a    &#8226;Public Health and Nutrition\u000a    Our research results have been used in health education television\u000a      programmes about human nutrition, \"The Truth about Food\" (BBC and\u000a      SBS (Australia)) [G]. This work was funded by the BBC (iv), and also\u000a      included in an associated book [H]. The programmes were first broadcast in\u000a      Jan 2007 and have been available online [G] throughout the assessment\u000a      period (2008 onwards).

Furthermore, EPI is the most robust magnetic\u000a      resonance (MR) imaging method for quantifying biophysical parameters. The\u000a      use of this technique to study the function of the gastrointestinal (GI)\u000a      tract has been pioneered by Gowland, a member of the Nottingham\u000a      MRI group, who, since 1993, has collaborated closely with Professor Robin\u000a      Spiller, a clinician specialising in gastroenterology at the University of\u000a      Nottingham. This collaboration has grown to encompass a large research\u000a      team including industry-sponsored research assistants and CASE-funded PhD\u000a      students, and, in particular, an interdisciplinary senior research fellow\u000a      (Dr Luca Marciani), a physicist who was a member of our MRI group until\u000a      2003, when he transferred to the University's Division of\u000a      Gastroenterology. Through this collaboration, we have used our unique\u000a      expertise in quantitative and high speed MRI to develop novel non-invasive\u000a      methods for measuring key physical parameters that characterise the\u000a      function of the GI system, including:\u000a    \u000a      the measurement of gastric emptying and intraluminal viscosity of\u000a        model meals (1997) [1,2], and the intragastric distribution of different\u000a        meal components (fat in 1999, foams in 2001 and gelation in 2004 [3]);\u000a      methods for assessing intraluminal emulsification of fat (2001);\u000a      GI motility measurements (using a locally-developed analysis algorithm\u000a        similar to m-mode ultrasound, 2001), intraluminal forces (studying the\u000a        breakdown of model particles that we designed and fabricated, 2001) [4];\u000a      evaluation of intraluminal flow rates, from which shear rates can be\u000a        deduced (1997);\u000a      transit time measurements (acquired using tailored pulse sequences in\u000a        combination with labelled tracer particles that were designed and\u000a        fabricated within the group, 2012);\u000a      the only method available to measure small bowel water content (2007)\u000a        [5].\u000a    \u000a    More recently, we have developed methods to study colonic volumes and the\u000a      characteristics of the colonic content, and we are currently developing\u000a      methods to assess colonic motility using MR tagging techniques.\u000a    We have also used these MR-based GI functional tests to make substantial\u000a      contributions to improving our understanding of the function of the GI\u000a      tract in health and disease. We characterised the interacting effects of\u000a      meal viscosities and nutrient contents on gastric emptying, gastric\u000a      accommodation and the sense of satiety [1,2], and also demonstrated the\u000a      effect of posture on the emptying of mixed fatty meals (1997), and how\u000a      this can be affected by meal formulation. We have also shown that many\u000a      meals mix more slowly than expected in the GI tract, which is important\u000a      for the design of drugs that are affected by the acidic environment of the\u000a      gastric lumen. We quantified the forces exerted by the stomach for the\u000a      first time (2001) [4] and have measured gastrointestinal motility and\u000a      intra-gastric flow rates.\u000a    This body of work led us to propose an MRI-based single diagnostic\u000a      examination for the comprehensive analysis of GI function; no other\u000a      modality can provide such a wide range of measurements in a single\u000a      examination and, for the vast majority of the measurements we make, no\u000a      alternative non-invasive assessment method is even available. The ability\u000a      to make repeated measurements has enabled the detailed study of the\u000a      response of the GI tract to meals in healthy volunteers and patients.

Poole's Ph.D. project, which commenced in\u000a      2004, focused on the\u000a      development of insert gradient and shim coils for use in high-field MRI of\u000a      the human head. The\u000a      IBEM approach was developed as part of this work, so as to allow the\u000a      design of coils wound on\u000a      surfaces that fit more closely to the head than the body-sized cylinders\u000a      used in most MRI systems.\u000a      From 2005-2006, Poole developed a versatile suite of algorithms and\u000a      subsequently an IBEM\u000a      software package for designing gradient and shim coils on\u000a      arbitrarily-shaped surfaces.\u000a    This software was demonstrated to our collaborators at Magnex Scientific\u000a      during regular project\u000a      meetings in 2006 (by this time, Magnex had been bought by Varian Inc.;\u000a      Varian were then bought\u000a      by Agilent in 2010 for $1.5bn; the manufacturing base has remained in\u000a      Yarnton, Oxfordshire\u000a      throughout the changes in ownership). It rapidly become clear to Varian\u000a      that the IBEM software\u000a      offered much greater versatility than the coil design programmes that they\u000a      were then using. The\u000a      facility to design and produce coils on gapped or split surfaces generated\u000a      particular interest. To\u000a      demonstrate the potential of the IBEM software, Poole worked with Dan\u000a      Green (Varian) to\u000a      generate novel, gapped, designs of shielded gradient and shim coils for a\u000a      prototype hybrid\u000a      PET\/MRI system. These coils could not be designed using the software that\u000a      Varian were using at\u000a      that time.\u000a    Subsequently, Varian constructed these coils and supplied them\u000a      commercially to Adrian Carpenter\u000a      and colleagues at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre in Addenbrooke's\u000a      Hospital (2008), paying a\u000a      3% royalty to the University of Nottingham. Bowtell and Poole\u000a      published a paper [2] jointly with\u000a      Carpenter's group and the Varian collaborators, describing the novel coil\u000a      designs and the first\u000a      experimental tests of their performance in the hybrid PET\/MRI system.\u000a      Having seen the value of\u000a      the IBEM approach, Varian extended the agreement with the University of\u000a      Nottingham in 2007, and\u000a      this now allows them to use Poole's advanced design software, provided\u000a      that they pay a 3%\u000a      royalty on any coil sales arising from its use. Since 2008, Varian, and\u000a      subsequently Agilent, have\u000a      used the software to design a number of coil systems, including short head\u000a      gradient coils for ultra-high\u000a      field imaging, and gapped systems for use in combined radiotherapy\/MRI\u000a      systems. Agilent's\u000a      Research and Development Manager for Gradient Coils [A] describes the\u000a      impact on their business:\u000a    \"The ability of the software to account for complex gradient coil\u000a        geometries allows us to explore the\u000a        more challenging design aspects of bespoke and integrated systems, for\u000a        instance hybrid MRI\/PET\u000a        and MRI applications in radiotherapy. Agilent's entry into these new\u000a        markets has resulted in some\u000a        &#163;2.8 million in new system sales since 2009. We also offer some unique\u000a        solutions to our customers\u000a        in the university research sector; often their challenging requirements\u000a        can only be met by the\u000a        flexibility of the IBEM software. Sales for these upgrades are of the\u000a        order &#163;600k since 2009.\u000a        Exploitation of these new markets would not have been possible without\u000a        Nottingham's research\u000a        into complex gradient coil design.\"\u000a    In 2009, Bowtell established a new collaboration with Paramed\u000a      Medical Systems (Genova, Italy)\u000a      who sell `open' MRI scanners. As described in Section 2, open MRI scanners\u000a      offer several\u000a      significant advantages over the conventional tubular design including:\u000a      better patient experience,\u000a      particularly for the paediatric, anxious or larger patient; weight bearing\u000a      and postural diagnostics in,\u000a      for instance, the upper neck (cervical) and lumbar spine cases (see\u000a      figure); the potential for real-time\u000a      monitoring of surgery. The Paramed systems are based on permanent (0.15T)\u000a      and MgB2\u000a      superconducting (0.5T) magnet technology, offering a cheaper alternative\u000a      to whole body scanners.\u000a      A Paramed scanner (MROpen; see Figure) was recently installed in the `Upright\u000a      MRI Centre', a\u000a      private healthcare centre opened in Leeds in September 2012.\u000a    Scanners of this type use bi-planar gradient coils that are mounted on\u000a      the magnet pole pieces and\u000a      so are in close proximity to large amounts of highly permeable iron. The\u000a      new collaboration, which\u000a      also involved researchers at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in\u000a      Genova, focused on adapting\u000a      the IBEM approach to take account of the nearby magnetic material when\u000a      designing coils, and was\u000a      driven by Paramed's need to incorporate active magnetic shielding of their\u000a      coils so as to improve\u000a      system performance. Following Paramed's purchase of the IBEM software, it\u000a      was modified, in\u000a      collaboration with Bowtell and IIT researchers, and has\u000a      subsequently been used in a number of\u000a      development projects and products at Paramed, including their core product\u000a      lines, the MROpen\u000a      (see figure) and MRJ3300 (now known as MRInspire) scanners. Paramed have\u000a      implemented new\u000a      design processes as a result of the IBEM software which affect their\u000a      complete product range (that\u000a      currently provides a turnover of &#8364;8M\/year) and will support future\u000a      projected growth. These details,\u000a      and the associated commercial advantages which result, are highlighted by\u000a      the Research and\u000a      Development Manager at Paramed [B]:\u000a    \"The availability of the IBEM software, modified by IIT and Paramed\u000a        during and after collaboration\u000a        with Nottingham School of Physics and Astronomy (since 2009), helped us\u000a        to build a new design\u000a        tool for optimizing gradient coil performances in presence of iron,\u000a        which is an extremely important\u000a        advantage for MRI system design\"\u000a    In summary, our numerical methods for the optimisation of gradient coils\u000a      have been adopted by\u000a      manufacturers of MRI equipment to enhance performance, functionality and\u000a      patient care, thus\u000a      generating impact in the economy and healthcare.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Theoretical and computational methods for optimising the design of\u000a      gradient and shim coils with\u000a      arbitrary shapes and topologies were developed in collaboration with\u000a      Magnex Scientific as part of a\u000a      CASE award (2004-07).

The three gradient coils found in each scanner are used to\u000a      produce magnetic fields\u000a      that vary linearly with position along three orthogonal axes. These field\u000a      gradients are crucial for the\u000a      spatial encoding of the magnetic resonance signal &#8212; a process which forms\u000a      the basis of MRI.\u000a      Gradient coil performance strongly influences many aspects of magnetic\u000a      resonance (MR) image\u000a      quality, including the spatial resolution and achievable contrast. Shim\u000a      coils are used to correct\u000a      unavoidable inhomogeneities in the main static magnetic field that is also\u000a      used in MRI. These\u000a      inhomogeneities may arise from various sources, such as the magnetic\u000a      susceptibility of a human\u000a      subject, or imperfections in the magnet construction, and, if uncorrected,\u000a      result in significant image\u000a      distortions.\u000a    The Nottingham MRI group has a longstanding track record in the\u000a      development of improved\u000a      hardware for MRI systems, dating back to the early work for which Sir\u000a      Peter Mansfield shared the\u000a      2003 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology. This research activity has\u000a      continued to the present\u000a      day, with a particular emphasis on gradient and shim coil technology.\u000a      Previous high impact work in\u000a      this area includes the development in the late 1980s of actively-shielded\u000a      gradient coils, which are\u000a      now used in all MR scanners, and the subsequent establishment of methods\u000a      for designing high\u000a      efficiency coils. These developments formed the basis for the substantial\u000a      improvement in gradient\u000a      system performance in the 1990s, which first allowed the routine\u000a      implementation of functional\u000a      magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and other imaging procedures that\u000a      rely on strong, rapidly\u000a      switched gradients.\u000a    Since the late 1990s, the focus of our research has shifted to the\u000a      development of methods for the\u000a      design of coils with complex geometries or topologies that are required to\u000a      enable new applications\u000a      and advances in MRI. Until recently, gradient coils for MR scanners were\u000a      designed using a simple\u000a      parameterisation of the current density that represents the energised coil\u000a      windings. This approach\u000a      is well suited to the production of gradient coils that are wound on\u000a      simple surfaces, such as the\u000a      long cylinders used in early MR scanners, but cannot easily be applied to\u000a      designing coils on more\u000a      complex surfaces that may be truncated, folded, gapped or split. Research\u000a      into these complex coil\u000a      shapes was motivated by their requirement in novel MRI systems, including:\u000a    \u000a      scanners incorporating insert gradient and shim coils that can be used\u000a        for enhanced\u000a        imaging of particular target structures &#8212; for example, insert head\u000a        gradient and shim coils\u000a        that fit closely around the head\u000a      `open' MRI scanners which depart from the conventional tubular shape &#8212;\u000a        these can\u000a        enhance the patient experience through reduction of stress (particularly\u000a        important for\u000a        paediatric and obese patients) and can also be used for real-time\u000a        monitoring of surgery and\u000a        other complex processes; an example is the `MROpen' system, developed by\u000a        Paramed\u000a        Medical Systems (see Figure), which allows imaging of human subjects in\u000a        weight-bearing,\u000a        vertical, postures\u000a      hybrid systems, such as combined positron emission tomography (PET)\u000a        and MRI scanners,\u000a        and combined radiotherapy and MRI systems, in which the coils must be\u000a        designed to be\u000a        compatible with the spatial arrangement and operation of the equipment\u000a        required for the\u000a        additional modality.\u000a    \u000a    Boundary element methods (BEM) offer a powerful approach for coil design,\u000a      allowing the\u000a      generation of coils wound on arbitrarily-shaped surfaces, so as to produce\u000a      any form of field\u000a      variation that is consistent with Maxwell's equations. This approach\u000a      involves meshing the current-carrying\u000a      surface into an array of boundary elements and then setting the current\u000a      density at each\u000a      element, so as to minimise a functional that reflects the desired coil\u000a      characteristics.\u000a    Between 2004 and 2007, Bowtell (a member of the Nottingham MRI\u000a      group), working with CASE\u000a      Ph.D. student, Poole, applied the boundary element approach to the inverse\u000a      problem of designing\u000a      coils on arbitrarily shaped surfaces that would produce specified magnetic\u000a      field distributions. The\u000a      outcome was a novel inverse BEM (IBEM) approach. This was implemented in\u000a      software written by\u000a      Poole, and combined with a powerful mesh-generating program, so as to\u000a      allow the design and\u000a      production of coils with completely arbitrary geometry [1]. Poole's\u000a      studentship was funded by\u000a      Magnex Scientific\/Varian Inc.[i] and his Ph.D. work linked into an\u000a      EPSRC-funded project which\u000a      focused on applying techniques in computational mechanics to the design\u000a      and analysis of gradient\u000a      and radio-frequency coils for MRI [ii].\u000a    In 2007, Poole and Bowtell worked with Alun Lucas, Rob\u000a      Hawkes and Adrian Carpenter (Wolfson Brain Imaging\u000a      Centre at the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge), and\u000a      Dan Green and Simon Pittard (Varian Inc., now Agilent), on\u000a      the design and construction of coils for a hybrid PET-MRI\u000a      system [2]. Combining PET and MRI within one instrument\u000a      requires many engineering compromises as the equipment\u000a      for the two modalities vies for the space closest to the\u000a      sample\/subject. Nevertheless, a combined PET-MRI\u000a      system offers many potential benefits for clinical and pre-clinical\u000a      imaging. In the configuration which was developed,\u000a      the PET detectors reside in a gap between the two halves\u000a      of a 1T split-magnet cryostat. The gradient and shim coils\u000a      had to incorporate a 110 mm gap from which wires are\u000a      excluded so as to avoid compromising the process of\u000a      positron detection. It was not possible to produce coils with\u000a      this gapped geometry using conventional methods of coil\u000a      design, but Poole's IBEM software was able to cope with\u000a      the complex coil shapes. It was used to design three,\u000a      orthogonal, (magnetically) shielded gradient coils and a\u000a      shielded, zero-order shim coil. These coils were\u000a      constructed and tested in the hybrid PET-MRI system and\u000a      successfully used in simultaneous PET-MRI experiments\u000a      [2].\u000a\u000aTop: Lumbar spine MRI scan (imaged under vertical compression)\u000a\u000a\u000aLeft: Paramed&#8217;s MROpen scanner.\u000a\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32737","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Using the world's first 3T MRI scanner we demonstrated, in papers from\u000a      1994 onwards [1,2], that it was possible to generate high resolution,\u000a      artefact-free images. These results played a significant role in\u000a      convincing magnet and system manufacturers that the move to high field was\u000a      not only technically feasible, but could herald the new state-of-the-art\u000a      for clinical MRI systems.\u000a    The primary impact of high-field MRI on patient care has been through the\u000a      improvement in the quality of clinical diagnostic scans that high field\u000a      provides (see estimate of the number of patient examinations below), but\u000a      high field has also underpinned the new field of functional MRI (fMRI). As\u000a      described in section 2, the work of the Nottingham group was critical in\u000a      this development through their demonstration of EPI at 3T [1], and this\u000a      technique has subsequently been implemented in all commercial high-field\u000a      scanners. The stimulus to the new field of fMRI arose since EPI offers the\u000a      fastest mode of image acquisition, and was rapidly adopted as the\u000a      functional neuroimaging method of choice. EPI offered a viable alternative\u000a      to `FLASH', the fastest imaging technique then (mid- 1990s) commercially\u000a      available (FLASH proved inadequate to deal with the confounding effects of\u000a      motion on the small signal changes due to brain activity that must be\u000a      detected in fMRI).\u000a    The move to 3T gathered momentum and, by the mid-2000s, sales of 3T MR\u000a      scanners by all three major manufacturers (GE, Philips and Siemens) were\u000a      beginning to grow. At first, it was major MRI research centres who\u000a      installed 3T scanners (for example, in 1998 Oxford University's fMRIB\u000a      Laboratory were the first to follow the Nottingham example in the UK),\u000a      then clinical research facilities, and eventually larger hospitals, both\u000a      increasing capacity and replacing some of their older 1.5T systems.\u000a    The growth of high-field MRI has been sustained through the assessment\u000a      period (2008 onwards). Figures provided by a leading industrial source [A]\u000a      provide some key indicative data:\u000a    \u000a      The number of new scanner installations per annum (high- and\u000a        low-field) grew from approximately 2000 in the year 2003, to\u000a        approximately 3000 in 2010 (global figures);\u000a      The fraction of these new installations designated as high field (3T)\u000a        grew from less than 2% before 2003, to 20% in 2010;\u000a      The typical cost of a 3T MRI scanner is $2M [B]; the value of global\u000a        sales of high-field scanners in 2010 (the last year for which data are\u000a        available to us in a relevant form) was $1 billion;\u000a      In the first half of the REF assessment period (2008-2010; data were\u000a        available only for this period) approximately 1400 high-field scanners\u000a        were sold.\u000a    \u000a    Extrapolating these data [A] we estimate that over 2500 high-field\u000a      scanners were installed from January 2008 - July 2013 (this is almost\u000a      certainly an underestimate since the rising trend in sales is neglected),\u000a      representing a global investment of $5 billion.\u000a    To evaluate the impact on patient care over the assessment period we\u000a      estimate the number of high-field examinations as follows: (i) the average\u000a      number of scans per scanner per year (averaged over both low- and\u000a      high-field scanners) in England is 6500 (using figures of 300 installed\u000a      scanners [C] and two million patient examinations [C]); the average number\u000a      of operational high-field scanners during the assessment period is taken\u000a      as 2250 (1000 installed prior to 2008 [A], plus half of the newly\u000a      installed scanners). This gives a global estimate of the capacity for 80\u000a      million patient examinations using high-field MRI from January 2008 to\u000a      July 2013. Taking into account the use of some of the high-field scanners\u000a      for research, and their application in more complex cases, we estimate\u000a      that 30 - 40 million high-field patient examinations were performed during\u000a      this period.\u000a    The role of the Nottingham research in underpinning these developments is\u000a      confirmed by leading industrialists:\u000a    `The development of a prototype 3T scanner at the Sir Peter Mansfield\u000a        Magnetic Resonance Centre in Nottingham demonstrated that the\u000a        theoretical benefits of high field could be realised in practice.'\u000a      Joint written statement from the Premium &amp; Portfolio MR Manager and\u000a      the 7T &amp; High Field MR Product Segment Marketing Manager, GE\u000a      Healthcare [D];\u000a    `The 3T scanner constructed at the Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic\u000a        Resonance Centre (SPMMRC) demonstrated that ....... the high speed\u000a        imaging technique of echo-planar imaging, developed in Nottingham by Sir\u000a        Peter Mansfield, could be implemented at high field. The combination of\u000a        high field and imaging speed was crucial in the development of\u000a        functional MRI, now the mostly widely used functional neuro-imaging\u000a        technique.' MRI Clinical Science Director, Philips Healthcare [E].\u000a    The success of the Nottingham group also led to a change in the strategy\u000a      of magnet manufacturers such as Oxford Instruments and motivated a\u000a      decision to re-invest in the manufacture of wide-bore superconducting 3T\u000a      magnets. Morris (Director of the Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic\u000a      Resonance Centre (SPMMRC), part of the School of Physics &amp; Astronomy)\u000a      held a consultancy with Oxford Instruments during the period when the\u000a      first 3T scanner was built (early 1990s - 1998) and provided advice\u000a      regarding the technical challenges of implementing MRI at 3T and the new\u000a      market opportunities for high-field scanners. His contact at Oxford\u000a      Instruments was a senior magnet designer who was a member of the main\u000a      Board during this period and states:\u000a    `The failure of 4T systems to 'take off' had made the Board of Oxford\u000a        Instruments nervous about investment in high field systems, but you\u000a        helped to convince us that there would be a new market for such\u000a        systems,...' ex-Board Member of Oxford Instruments now working as a\u000a      consultant [F].\u000a    In addition, fMRI, which was initially used primarily as a research tool\u000a      in basic neuroscience and clinical studies, now supports clinical and\u000a      commercial applications which impact directly on the diagnosis and\u000a      treatment of patients. Clinically, fMRI is used in pre-surgical mapping of\u000a      the eloquent cortex, and in some institutions this has become standard\u000a      procedure [G]. It is also contributing to the diagnosis of\u000a      neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. In\u000a      addition, fMRI provides a basis for monitoring the actions of new\u000a      therapeutic agents, enabling their mechanisms of action to be identified\u000a      and\/or confirmed. It is also being taken up by companies offering\u000a      diagnostic and other services, including the elucidation of pain pathways\u000a      [H].\u000a    The same drivers that led to the development of high-field 3T MRI systems\u000a      apply a fortiori to the development of ultra-high field (7T) MRI\u000a      systems. However, the barriers to delivering the additional improvements\u000a      were substantial, and it was unclear whether such systems were a viable\u000a      proposition, even in a purely research environment. In 2005, we took\u000a      delivery of the first 7T MRI system to be supplied by Philips. Our work in\u000a      developing structural and functional MRI on this system stimulated take-up\u000a      by several prestigious research institutions, as confirmed by a statement\u000a      from Philips:\u000a    `The SPMMRC was one of the first in the world to undertake human\u000a        studies at ultra-high field (7T). It took delivery of the first 7T MRI\u000a        system to be constructed by Philips Healthcare and the pioneering work\u000a        of the SPMMRC at 7T encouraged investment in this technology and rapid\u000a        uptake by the user community.' MRI Clinical Science Director,\u000a      Philips Healthcare [E].\u000a    It is estimated that forty 7T instruments have now been sold [I], with\u000a      further growth anticipated. The current cost of a 7T scanner is over $10M.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Nottingham researchers constructed the world's first 3T MRI scanner, thus\u000a      demonstrating the viability and benefits of high-field MRI.

Despite the clear theoretical advantage of still higher fields,\u000a      namely improved signal-noise ratio resulting in higher spatial and\u000a      temporal resolution, attempts to introduce 4T systems were not successful\u000a      (see Section 4). The major manufacturers (Siemens, Philips and GE)\u000a      produced just a handful of these systems in the late 1980s and then\u000a      abandoned the project since the anticipated improvements were not\u000a      realised, primarily due to limitations in the performance of the scanner\u000a      hardware and software. A field of 1.5T then remained the clinical standard\u000a      for most of the next two decades.\u000a    It was against this background that the Nottingham MRI group commissioned\u000a      and took delivery of the world's first 3T whole-body magnet in October\u000a      1991. In a project funded by the Department of Health, British Technology\u000a      Group and the University of Nottingham (1991-1994), we developed a unique\u000a      MRI scanner around this magnet. This involved designing and building our\u000a      own control electronics, radio-frequency and gradient systems, as well as\u000a      developing our own scanner control software. The aim, and successful\u000a      outcome, of the project was to produce a high-field system with the\u000a      ability to run echo-planar imaging (EPI). EPI is a technique that was\u000a      developed in Nottingham, and whose importance was recognised in the award\u000a      to Sir Peter Mansfield of the 2003 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.\u000a      The extremely high quality that we demonstrated in our 3T EPI images was\u000a      particularly noteworthy [1,2;i,ii], given that at that time commercial\u000a      manufacturers were struggling to implement EPI even at 1.5T.\u000a    The application of EPI at 3T provided an important enabling technology\u000a      for the field of functional MRI (fMRI) [iii] in which brain function is\u000a      monitored through the detection of changes in local blood flow. fMRI is\u000a      heavily reliant on high temporal and spatial resolution, and our 3T\u000a      scanner was ideally suited to research in this area. From 1994 onwards,\u000a      fMRI formed a major focus of our research, and we made several significant\u000a      contributions to its early development including the first paper on Single\u000a      Event MRI, and indeed coined the term `Single (cognitive) Event' [3]. In a\u000a      series of highly cited papers [4-5], we then demonstrated how fMRI could\u000a      be used to investigate the cortical encoding of sensory responses in the\u000a      auditory [4], somatosensory and olfactory cortices [5]. Our work, funded\u000a      by the MRC in a series of special project and programme grants which have\u000a      run continuously since 1993, was a major factor contributing to the\u000a      establishment of 3T MRI as the new clinical standard for neuroimaging and\u000a      functional neuroimaging (see Section 4).\u000a    We continued with our strategy of delivering higher sensitivity through\u000a      increased magnetic field strength when, in 2005, we acquired one of the\u000a      first 7T scanners in the world (the first in the UK and the first to be\u000a      supplied by Philips) through a &#163;3M award from the HEFCE Joint\u000a      Infrastructure Fund [iv]. This field strength posed new challenges as the\u000a      wavelength in tissues at 300MHz is commensurate with the dimensions of the\u000a      human head, leading to significant interference effects. Our work at 7T,\u000a      demonstrating the increased sensitivity of fMRI, the increased spatial\u000a      resolution of anatomical images, and the improved access to new contrast\u000a      (including chemical exchange saturation transfer sensitisation and\u000a      quantitative susceptibility maps), has demonstrated that these effects are\u000a      surmountable [6,7;v-viii]. Indeed we have used the improved susceptibility\u000a      contrast to develop a reliable method for differential diagnosis of\u000a      multiple sclerosis (MS) [6; vi,vii]. Moreover, the quality and robustness\u000a      of our 7T data have played a significant role in stimulating the growth of\u000a      the 7T MRI market worldwide.\u000a    The following members of our MRI group contributed to the development of\u000a      the world's first 3T scanner: Bowtell, Francis, Glover,\u000a      Gowland, Mansfield, Morris; this group together\u000a      with Brookes and Mullinger contributed to the 7T work.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32738","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The adoption of guidelines based on our research was stimulated by the\u000a      publication by the EU\u000a      Commission of the Physical Agents Directive 2004\/40\/EC in 2004. The aim of\u000a      this Directive was to\u000a      harmonise European legislation and establish a formal legal framework for\u000a      electromagnetic field\u000a      (EMF) exposure of workers, which would have been based on the guidelines\u000a      issued by the\u000a      International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in\u000a      1998 [Health Physics\u000a      74 (4):494 522; 1998]. The Exposure Limit Value (a current density of 10\u000a      mA m-2) relating to\u000a      exposure to magnetic fields in the frequency range 0-100 kHz, which was\u000a      proposed in the-\u000a      Directive, would have rendered many common MRI procedures illegal in\u000a      Europe (as detailed in a\u000a      report by the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) [A]). The Directive\u000a      would consequently have\u000a      had a severe, negative impact on patients, health professionals, and\u000a      scanner manufacturers.\u000a    However, this Exposure Limit Value was based on the extrapolation of old\u000a      or very limited data.\u000a      Through the programme of research described above, we produced a body of\u000a      work which updated,\u000a      and\/or contradicted, the data on which the proposed EU limits were based.\u000a      Our research thus\u000a      provided a platform for a lobbying process (described below, and in the\u000a      Institute of Physics report\u000a      \"MRI and the Physical Agents (EMF) Directive\", November 2008). In 2009,\u000a      this lobbying resulted in\u000a      the relaxation of the ICNIRP static field exposure guidelines for MRI\u000a      (described in a draft report of\u000a      which Gowland is a co-author) and later produced a derogation of\u000a      MRI from the scope of the 2004\u000a      EU directive.\u000a    The Nottingham group used their research to influence the UK government\u000a      to lobby for changes in\u000a      the proposed EU guidelines. A letter sent by Nottingham MRI physicists Gowland\u000a      and Morris (with\u000a      four other leading members of the UK MRI community) to Dr. Strather of the\u000a      National Radiological\u000a      Protection Board (NPRB) in June 2003 [B] drew attention to the\u000a      unreliability of the, then, ICNIRP\u000a      guidelines, and the impact on MRI of adopting the guidelines proposed by\u000a      the EU. Subsequently,\u000a      the lobbying was channelled through the Institute of Physics and\u000a      Engineering in Medicine (IPEM)\u000a      with Prof. Stephen Keevil (now IPEM President) playing a central role in\u000a      publicising the issue\u000a      through the national media (article in the Guardian [C]) with support from\u000a      Sense about Science, an\u000a      independent charitable trust. These activities led to a meeting with Lord\u000a      Hunt (2005, then Minister\u000a      of State at the Department for Work and Pensions) and an inquiry by the\u000a      House of Commons\u000a      Science and Technology Committee (to which Keevil, Gowland and\u000a      others provided evidence [D]).\u000a      This committee produced a report in June 2006 [D], which was critical of\u000a      the HSE, the UK Health\u000a      Protection Agency (HPA), ICNIRP and the European Commission. In 2007, the\u000a      Alliance for MRI\u000a      was formed and presented an HSE-commissioned report [A], which draws upon\u000a      our research [6],\u000a      in Brussels. Subsequently, a new Directive 2008\/46\/EC was adopted (23rd\u000a      April 2008). This\u000a      postponed the transposition deadline of Directive 2004\/40\/EC to 30th\u000a      April 2012. ICNIRP then re-\u000a      evaluated the relevant underlying science, drawing extensively on our work\u000a      [1-5], and introduced\u000a      new guidelines. On the 29th June 2013 Directive 2004\/40\/EC was\u000a      repealed and a new directive\u000a      2013\/35\/EU, based on guidelines from ICNIRP, in turn based on our\u000a      research, became official EU\u000a      law.\u000a    4.1 Evidence for the Impact of our research\u000a    4.1.1 Impact on Public Policy: Changing Underpinning Legal Frameworks\u000a    \u000a      The recommended action limits for low frequency magnetic field\u000a        exposure in our published\u000a        work [1,4], have been incorporated into guidelines by: ICNIRP (2009)\u000a        [E]; the HPA (2008) [F];\u000a        and the British Standards Institute and International Electrotechnical\u000a        Commission (2008) [G].\u000a        These recommended limits have global reach since ICNIRP is formally\u000a        recognised by the\u000a        World Health Organisation. In addition, Gowland was invited to\u000a        join (March 2013) the ICNIRP\u000a        Scientific Expert Group (SEG), contributing her expertise in MRI.\u000a      The ICNIRP guidelines, based in part on our research, have been\u000a        incorporated within the legal\u000a        framework for EMF exposure in Europe (population circa 500M). Workers in\u000a        the EU who may\u000a        be exposed to high magnetic fields will thus benefit from a more robust\u000a        understanding of the\u000a        effects of occupational electromagnetic field exposure.\u000a      The role and importance of Nottingham research in providing the\u000a        scientific basis for lobbying\u000a        UK and EU government organisations is confirmed by IPEM President-elect,\u000a        Prof. Stephen\u000a        Keevil who states, [H]\u000a    \u000a    `The work of the Nottingham group has made a tremendous contribution\u000a        to the body of\u000a        science underpinning negotiations about the EU EMF Directive, and\u000a        particularly has helped\u000a        MRI practitioners in their attempts to mitigate the adverse impact of\u000a        this legislation on MRI\u000a        in clinical practice and research. In an area where there are\u000a        significant gaps in the\u000a        literature, leading to assumptions and suppositions with little evidence\u000a        to support them, this\u000a        work has been very significant in our negotiations with the European\u000a        Commission and has\u000a        also had a major influence on the International Commission on\u000a        Non-Ionising Radiation\u000a        Protection (ICNIRP). It is of lasting significance to the MRI community\u000a        in Europe and\u000a        beyond.'\u000a    References to the media coverage, Prof. Keevil's appearances at the\u000a      European and UK\u000a      Parliaments, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee's\u000a      report `Watching\u000a      the Directives' (dated June 2006 and highlighting the impact on MRI), and\u000a      an HSE paper\u000a      identifying the agreed actions in the light of the House of Commons report\u000a      are also provided\u000a      [C,D,F].\u000a    4.1.2 Impact on Health and Economy\u000a    The revision of the original guidelines in the EU 2004\/40\/EC Directive\u000a      based on the Nottingham\u000a      work has mitigated a number of effects. The beneficiaries of these are:\u000a    \u000a      Patients undergoing MRI: if the Directive had proceeded as originally\u000a        planned, high-field (&#8805;3T)\u000a        MRI would have ceased until major and costly scanner redesigns could\u000a        have been\u000a        implemented, and the use of 1.5T MRI would have been limited [I]. This\u000a        would have had\u000a        particular impact on: patients suffering from neurological disease,\u000a        cancer and other serious\u000a        conditions where MRI is the leading, and sometimes only, relevant\u000a        non-invasive diagnostic\u000a        technique; patients requiring constant monitoring by staff during\u000a        scanning &#8212; this includes\u000a        patients under anaesthesia and paediatric patients for whom alternative\u000a        modalities, such as X-\u000a        ray Computed Tomography (CT), have clear associated risks (there are 500\u000a        lifetime deaths\u000a        associated with the 600,000 paediatric CT scans performed annually in\u000a        the UK); patients for\u000a        whom interventional MRI has replaced more invasive alternative\u000a        procedures. Overall the\u000a        European population has retained the full health benefits of mid- and\u000a        high-field MRI as a\u000a        consequence of the relaxation of the original EU directive, a process in\u000a        which our research and\u000a        lobbying played a critical role.\u000a      The National Health Service (NHS): in 2011 the NHS had 304 MRI\u000a        scanners with an average\u000a        cost of &#163;895k per scanner [National Audit Office, \"Managing High Value\u000a        Capital Equipment in\u000a        the NHS\" (2011)]. The EU Directive would have either introduced major\u000a        constraints on the use\u000a        of this equipment, or significant modification costs to make their use\u000a        legal. Estimating the\u000a        resulting financial cost is problematic, but the overall scale of\u000a        investment in MRI by the NHS is\u000a        ~&#163;270M (see above) so that modification costs, or reduced use, even in\u000a        the range of 5-10%\u000a        would have had a significant impact on health budgets and\/or delivery of\u000a        healthcare.\u000a      European Manufacturers of MRI scanners: the Directive would have\u000a        required radical\u000a        modifications to equipment and working practice to avoid exposure of\u000a        workers involved in the\u000a        manufacture, operation and servicing of equipment for no scientific or\u000a        clinical benefit. In 2007\u000a        the UK MRI industry supported ~ 4000 jobs and a value-added contribution\u000a        to GDP of &#163;195M\u000a        [J]. Since companies outside Europe, notably those in the USA, would not\u000a        have been governed\u000a        by the guidelines, this would have endangered the viability of European\u000a        industry and reduced\u000a        global competition.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research on the physiological effects of the electromagnetic fields\u000a      generated in magnetic\u000a      resonance imaging (MRI) has been used by: (i) the International Commission\u000a      on Non-Ionizing\u000a      Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) in\u000a      establishing advisory\u000a      limits and action values in their published regulatory guidelines; (ii)\u000a      the EU Commission as part of\u000a      the evidential basis in their decision to derogate MRI from the scope of\u000a      the Physical Agents\u000a      Directive 2004\/40\/EC.

Our\u000a      research has provided\u000a      advances in the fundamental understanding of the relevant underlying\u000a      physiological processes,\u000a      and was also motivated by a need to determine the possible impact on\u000a      patients and operators\u000a      when stationary, or moving, in and around magnetic resonance (MR)\u000a      scanners. The development\u000a      of high field MR scanners (3T since 1991, and 7T since 2005) in Nottingham\u000a      provided a major\u000a      stimulus for this work since physiological effects, such as magnetic\u000a      field-induced vertigo, have\u000a      been suggested as a barrier to the operation of high-field scanners. As we\u000a      describe below, our\u000a      research has been used by ICNIRP in establishing guidelines for\u000a      occupational exposure to static\u000a      and low frequency magnetic fields, and has helped to demonstrate that the\u000a      Physical Agents\u000a      Directive 2004\/40\/EC, which would have drastically disrupted the use of\u000a      MRI in Europe, was overly\u000a      proscriptive and based on incorrect application of theoretical models.\u000a    Our research has involved theory, computational modelling and\u000a      experimental studies and builds on\u000a      our expertise in electromagnetism, electronics and electrophysiology.\u000a      Since 1993 this work has\u000a      involved three members of academic staff (Glover, Gowland\u000a      and Bowtell) and has been funded by\u000a      three EPSRC project grants (i-iii), an EPSRC\/MRC Programme Grant on\u000a      ultra-high field (7T) MRI\u000a      (iv) and a Joint Infrastructure Fund award (v) that funded the development\u000a      of the UK's first 7T\u000a      scanner in Nottingham.\u000a    Below we describe the key elements of our investigations [1-5], organised\u000a      according to the\u000a      frequency range of the applied magnetic fields.\u000a    \u000a      Static Magnetic Fields\u000a    \u000a    We have demonstrated that exposure to static magnetic fields in and\u000a      around MR scanners,\u000a      including low frequency movements of the body in these fields, can produce\u000a      measureable effects\u000a      on the vestibular, visual and taste systems. Such exposure can lead to\u000a      postural sway, feelings of\u000a      vertigo, metallic taste and magneto-phosphenes. We characterised the field\u000a      regimes (rate of\u000a      change of field and total field change) which produce vertigo and metallic\u000a      taste effects [1,3], and\u000a      identified the magnetic susceptibility of the otoliths and induced\u000a      currents acting on the vestibular\u000a      afferent nerves as candidate mechanisms for magnetic field-induced vertigo\u000a      [1].\u000a    \u000a      Time-Varying Magnetic Fields (0-100 kHz)\u000a    \u000a    At frequencies of the order of kHz the currents induced in the human body\u000a      by time-varying\u000a      magnetic fields may cause peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). Numerical\u000a      simulations were used to\u000a      characterise the spatial distributions of the electric fields induced in\u000a      the body by time-varying\u000a      magnetic field gradients and to compare the applied magnetic fields (which\u000a      can be readily\u000a      measured) with the induced current density, which is used in regulatory\u000a      guidelines, but cannot\u000a      easily be measured [2]. In addition, we demonstrated the ability to\u000a      measure very low frequency\u000a      surface electric fields in a human subject exposed to the magnetic fields\u000a      of an MR scanner [4]. We\u000a      also attempted to repeat and extend small studies from the literature,\u000a      upon which much of the\u000a      regulatory position was founded. In particular, we conducted experiments\u000a      to measure the effects of\u000a      the time-varying magnetic fields used in MRI on visual acuity and visual\u000a      evoked potentials [5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32739","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 2007 the School started to collaborate with Brady Haran, then a\u000d\u000a      freelance BBC journalist, who had worked previously with the Nottingham\u000d\u000a      School of Chemistry on the production of short videos on the chemical\u000d\u000a      elements. This initiative arose from interest within the School to engage\u000d\u000a      with the wide and diverse audiences which can be accessed through new\u000d\u000a      forms of social media and mobile technology. Following the success of a\u000d\u000a      pilot phase in which several Physics-focused videos were featured on\u000d\u000a      Haran's Test Tube YouTube channel, which is aimed at a general\u000d\u000a      science audience, a decision was taken to launch the Sixty Symbols\u000d\u000a      YouTube channel (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/sixtysymbols)\u000d\u000a      and website (www.sixtysymbols.com),\u000d\u000a      devoted entirely to physics-related topics. This activity serves the\u000d\u000a      strategic aim of providing a route through which the public can become\u000d\u000a      engaged with our research.\u000d\u000a    Since its launch in February 2009, Sixty Symbols has amassed\u000d\u000a      21.2M views and 266k subscribers and there are now 212 freely-available\u000d\u000a      videos (all figures quoted are up to 31st July 2013), each of\u000d\u000a      which consists of a commentary on a particular scientific topic by a\u000d\u000a      researcher from the School. Sixty Symbols was designed to present\u000d\u000a      the workings of a research-led physics department in a manner that engages\u000d\u000a      the viewer by giving them a sense of membership through the development of\u000d\u000a      themes, familiar faces, and a common informal style. This feeling of\u000d\u000a      community is reflected by the rapid growth in the number of Sixty\u000d\u000a        Symbols' subscribers and the high proportion of returning viewers,\u000d\u000a      evidenced by large numbers of comments and channel subscriptions. Sixty\u000d\u000a        Symbols is now ranked within the top 0.01% of the tens of millions\u000d\u000a      of YouTube channels by number of views. For comparison, the viewing\u000d\u000a      statistics for Sixty Symbols compare favourably with the highly\u000d\u000a      acclaimed CERNTV, the YouTube channel of CERN, a major\u000d\u000a      international organisation which attracts wide media interest: CERNTV\u000d\u000a      has attracted 3.3M views and 36k subscribers to 179 uploaded videos since\u000d\u000a      its launch in 2007.\u000d\u000a    The Sixty Symbols videos and viewing figures (31st July\u000a      2013) related to the topics discussed in detail under the research section\u000d\u000a      on scanning probe microscopy (Section 2.1) are: Gold Nanoparticles\u000d\u000a      (72,627), Electrons (74,842), Nano (41,082), Wavefunction\u000d\u000a      (111,012), Vacuum Cannon (87,785), and Atomic Switch\u000d\u000a      (49,608).

This report is used\u000d\u000a      extensively below to provide supporting statistics and analysis of\u000d\u000a      audience interaction with Sixty Symbols. The report is based on:\u000d\u000a      data extracted from viewing statistics, audience comments appended to each\u000d\u000a      video [B], social media conversations, newspaper reports, stakeholder\u000d\u000a      interviews, teaching resources, and a student survey.

The open call for an STFC contract to shoot these\u000d\u000a      videos was won by a consortium headed by Merrifield (&#163;70.5k,\u000d\u000a      2010), with further support (&#163;18k) in 2012. These videos have had over\u000d\u000a      0.5M views, and the Backstage Science channel has 24,000\u000d\u000a      subscribers. STFC have estimated that this channel has been used by 3,000\u000d\u000a      teachers [A; see page 19].\u000d\u000a    The success of Sixty Symbols in delivering videos of high quality\u000d\u000a      and with educational value has been recognised by the invitation to Merrifield\u000d\u000a      to speak at the BrainSTEM `unconference' on YouTube science held\u000d\u000a      at the Perimeter Institute in 2012.

The topics covered in many of the early videos\u000d\u000a      provide the context for our research activities, and built an audience\u000d\u000a      through the release of videos tackling problems of topical interest and\u000d\u000a      scientific curiosities. This platform has subsequently been used to\u000d\u000a      introduce videos that focus upon specific results arising from research\u000d\u000a      within the School. In particular, videos focusing on specific research\u000d\u000a      outputs in the areas of nanoscience [1], galactic astronomy [2],\u000d\u000a      magnetoscience [3], soft matter [4,5] and theoretical particle physics [6]\u000d\u000a      have been produced. To illustrate our approach, we describe below two\u000d\u000a      areas of research which have been successfully translated into series of Sixty\u000a        Symbols videos.\u000d\u000a    2.1 Scanning probe microscopy: In a series of papers dating back\u000d\u000a      to 1995, Moriarty has investigated the use of scanning probes to\u000d\u000a      manipulate and image single molecules and atoms on silicon surfaces. The\u000d\u000a      initial focus was on the use of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to\u000d\u000a      position single C60 molecules on silicon surfaces at room\u000d\u000a      temperature. Following the purchase of a SRIF3-funded low temperature,\u000d\u000a      ultra-high vacuum atomic force microscope (AFM) in 2008, Moriarty\u000d\u000a      subsequently used AFM to toggle the state of Si dimers [1] and image\u000d\u000a      molecular orbitals of fullerene molecules (with support from EPSRC [i]).\u000d\u000a      This work has been translated to the Sixty Symbols project through\u000d\u000a      the initial posting of videos on background material in condensed matter\u000d\u000a      and surface physics: the video Gold Nanoparticles provides an\u000d\u000a      introduction to crystal structure, electron microscopy and nanoparticles;\u000d\u000a      Electrons introduces the wave nature of particles, including\u000d\u000a      electron diffraction from a silicon surface; Nano provides an\u000d\u000a      introduction to STM and nanoscience; Wave Function provides\u000d\u000a      background information on probability amplitude and describes the\u000d\u000a      molecular orbitals of C60; Vacuum Cannon introduces\u000d\u000a      vacuum technology. These videos contain many references to, and\u000d\u000a      explanations of, relevant experimental techniques and provide contextual\u000d\u000a      information for videos which focus on specific research outputs, such as\u000d\u000a      the AFM manipulation of Si atoms discussed in [1] and the video Atomic\u000d\u000a        Switch (manipulating a single atom).\u000d\u000a    2.2 Galactic Astronomy: Merrifield has been studying the\u000d\u000a      rates at which patterns rotate in galaxies since 1995, and this work has\u000d\u000a      resulted in 7 refereed publications to date, including [2], with support\u000d\u000a      from STFC [ii]. Measurements of this wave phenomenon have significant\u000d\u000a      implications for the way in which galaxies evolve and may even provide new\u000d\u000a      insight into the distribution of dark matter in galaxies. Merrifield\u000d\u000a      described many of the properties of galaxies in the videos Plus or\u000d\u000a        Minus (looking at the distance scale in the Milky Way), Redshift\u000d\u000a      (Milky Way merger with Andromeda), Dark Matter (looking at the\u000d\u000a      existence and distribution of dark matter in the Universe) and Milky\u000d\u000a        Way's Twin (spiral structure, etc. in a galaxy very like our own),\u000d\u000a      as well as in videos on the sister Deep Sky Videos channel (see\u000d\u000a      Section 4). This allowed us to present his recent work [2] on measuring\u000d\u000a      pattern speeds and their variation with radius in spiral galaxies, as well\u000d\u000a      as galaxy bar pattern speeds, in the video Spiral Galaxies.\u000d\u000a    In addition, we have released background videos related to cold atoms,\u000d\u000a      magnetic levitation, graphene, magnetic resonance imaging and\u000d\u000a      semiconductor physics which will provide the relevant background physics\u000d\u000a      for a further phase of videos focusing on specific research results.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32898","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This interdisciplinary project developed a new tamponade agent to enhance\u000d\u000a      the clinical outcome\u000d\u000a      after treatment of retinal detachments. The medical team involved were\u000d\u000a      faced with the problem that\u000d\u000a      standard tamponade agents are based on silicone oils which can emulsify in\u000d\u000a      the eye and cause\u000d\u000a      adverse side effects. They discussed this with Garvey (Physics\u000d\u000a      Department), who investigated the\u000d\u000a      reasons for the emulsification. His underpinning research also suggested\u000d\u000a      the solution to the\u000d\u000a      problem and provided the required proof of principle that a silicone oil\u000d\u000a      with an increased\u000d\u000a      extensional viscosity had much higher resistance to emulsification. The\u000d\u000a      increase in extensional\u000d\u000a      viscosity was achieved by the addition of a low percentage of a very high\u000d\u000a      molecular weight polymer\u000d\u000a      of the same chemistry to the silicone oil. Following on from this, the UoL\u000d\u000a      established that the\u000d\u000a      extensional viscosity property of the blend also made the material easier\u000d\u000a      to inject in comparison\u000d\u000a      with an equivalent silicone oil with the same shear viscosity but without\u000d\u000a      the high molecular weight\u000d\u000a      additive.\u000d\u000a    An additional benefit of this approach is that since no chemically\u000d\u000a      different material has been added\u000d\u000a      to the clinical grade silicone oil, the regulatory requirements were\u000d\u000a      easily met. In 2007, a\u000d\u000a      collaboration was established with Fluoron GmbH, a silicone oil tamponade\u000d\u000a      manufacturer, to\u000d\u000a      develop the proof of principle prototype into a clinical grade product.\u000d\u000a      Fluoron GmbH licensed the\u000d\u000a      technology from the University and have since contributed a minimum\u000d\u000a      payment of &#163;10k per year\u000d\u000a      and paid all patent costs.\u000d\u000a    Fluoron GmbH launched the product, named Siluron&#174; 2000, in 2008 (EC\u000d\u000a      certification: CE 575554)\u000d\u000a      [5-7]. It accounted for 32% of Fluoron's sales by units in the period\u000d\u000a      2008-13 with 34,208 sales by\u000d\u000a      30th September 2013 [8]. A second product, named Siluron&#174; Xtra,\u000d\u000a      based on this technology, was\u000d\u000a      launched for sale in July 2013 (EC certification: CE 575554). This product\u000d\u000a      has 10% of the high\u000d\u000a      molecular weight additive, further increasing the resistance to\u000d\u000a      emulsification while maintaining the\u000d\u000a      ease of injection within the range of current clinical products. Fluoron\u000d\u000a      GmbH have brought this\u000d\u000a      second product to market in response to requests from vitreoretinal\u000d\u000a      surgeons [5] and have sold\u000d\u000a      1,145 units part way through its first year of introduction [8]. These\u000d\u000a      products have enabled Fluoron\u000d\u000a      to gain new customers and reduce complaint rates by 40% [8].\u000d\u000a    The ultimate beneficiaries of this development are patients. Current\u000d\u000a      tamponade agents are either\u000d\u000a      made from 1000mPas silicone oil that is known to emulsify in the eye and\u000d\u000a      cause adverse effects\u000d\u000a      for the patient, or 5000mPas silicone oil that is very viscous and\u000d\u000a      difficult to inject, making surgery\u000d\u000a      more difficult. All silicone oils are currently removed after 3-6 months\u000d\u000a      because of the risk of\u000d\u000a      complications resulting from their emulsification. The new Siluron&#174; 2000\u000d\u000a      has a shear viscosity of\u000d\u000a      2000mPas, making it easier to inject than 5000mPas oil, but because of the\u000d\u000a      increased\u000d\u000a      emulsification resistance, it is less likely to cause adverse effects to\u000d\u000a      the patient [9-11]. Another\u000d\u000a      major advantage of Siluron&#174; 2000 is that its extensional viscosity makes\u000d\u000a      it easier to inject than an\u000d\u000a      equivalent oil, meaning that smaller gauge instruments can be used to\u000d\u000a      inject and remove it causing\u000d\u000a      a significant reduction in trauma to the patient's eye due to the surgery.\u000d\u000a      This also fits very well with\u000d\u000a      the general move within vitreoretinal surgery to the use of smaller gauge\u000d\u000a      instruments. Siluron&#174;\u000d\u000a      Xtra has a shear viscosity of 5000mPas and can therefore be injected and\u000d\u000a      removed using existing\u000d\u000a      surgical equipment but has been requested by clinicians owing to its\u000d\u000a      enhanced resistance to\u000d\u000a      emulsification and thus improved clinical outcome for patients.\u000d\u000a    This development is important because the patients requiring this\u000d\u000a      treatment would go blind if not\u000d\u000a      treated. The incidence of retinal detachment is reported as 1 per 10,000\u000d\u000a      of population per year and\u000d\u000a      of these 15-20% are treated with silicone oil tamponades. Some\u000d\u000a      vitreoretinal surgeons have so far\u000d\u000a      not used oil-based tamponades because of the related complications and\u000d\u000a      therefore the availability\u000d\u000a      of an oil with increased emulsification resistance is expected to increase\u000d\u000a      the availability of this\u000d\u000a      treatment option. This is the first product specifically designed to\u000d\u000a      address the problem of\u000d\u000a      emulsification. Fluoron GmbH has sold over 25,000 units of Siluron&#174; 2000.\u000d\u000a      In 2012 the units were\u000d\u000a      sold in 37 different countries, with the largest numbers going to Germany\u000d\u000a      and Egypt and\u000d\u000a      substantial numbers going to Singapore, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland.\u000d\u000a      They have recently\u000d\u000a      (August 2013) received a licence to sell Siluron&#174; 2000 and Xtra in China\u000d\u000a      and believe this to be a\u000d\u000a      substantial market, expecting to sell over 1000 units in the first year.\u000d\u000a      An audit of the use of\u000d\u000a      Siluron&#174; 2000 in St Paul's Eye Unit at the Royal Liverpool University\u000d\u000a      Hospital on 20 patients\u000d\u000a      reported: \"Clinically it proved easy to inject and remove in a small-gauge\u000d\u000a      setup.

It is the final common\u000d\u000a      pathway for many disease processes including diabetic retinopathy and\u000d\u000a      age-related macular\u000d\u000a      degeneration. Treatment involves the removal of vitreous humour from the\u000d\u000a      eye and its replacement\u000d\u000a      with silicone oil to cause closure of the retinal tear. The emulsification\u000d\u000a      of silicone oil-based\u000d\u000a      tamponade agents, which are used in the treatment of complex retinal\u000d\u000a      detachments, is a significant\u000d\u000a      clinical problem. This causes clouding of vision and adverse biological\u000d\u000a      responses, including\u000d\u000a      inflammatory reactions and blocking of the fluid outflow from the eye,\u000d\u000a      potentially leading to\u000d\u000a      glaucoma. Currently, high shear viscosity oils are used to counter\u000d\u000a      emulsification, but the higher the\u000d\u000a      shear viscosity the more difficult the oils are to inject and remove from\u000d\u000a      the eye. This project took a\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinary approach to improving tamponades involving Dr Michael\u000d\u000a      Garvey (a Senior\u000d\u000a      Research Fellow in the Department of Physics, UoL) and Prof Rachel\u000d\u000a      Williams (a senior lecturer in\u000d\u000a      Department of Clinical Engineering, UoL) in collaboration with Prof David\u000d\u000a      Wong, Consultant\u000d\u000a      Vitreoretinal surgeon, University of Hong Kong and Honorary Professor\u000d\u000a      (UoL) and Mr Theodor\u000d\u000a      Stappler, Honorary Lecturer (Clinical, Royal Liverpool University\u000d\u000a      Hospital) who provided strong\u000d\u000a      clinical input. A highly qualified surfactant chemist (Dr Michael Day,\u000d\u000a      Postdoctoral research\u000d\u000a      associate, UoL), who was based in the Physics Department, studied the\u000d\u000a      mechanisms involved in\u000d\u000a      the formation of the emulsions in the eye. The physics-based team,\u000d\u000a      following an idea of Garvey's,\u000d\u000a      showed that the process of emulsification in the eye results from the\u000d\u000a      oscillation of the\u000d\u000a      silicone\/water interface under a shear force which leads to the pulling\u000d\u000a      out of filaments of the oil into\u000d\u000a      the aqueous phase. which then snap, resulting in the formation of\u000d\u000a      persistent satellite silicone\u000d\u000a      droplets. Further, they demonstrated that the addition of very high\u000d\u000a      molecular weight polymers to\u000d\u000a      the oil increases its extensional viscosity and prevents filament snapping\u000d\u000a      and satellite droplet\u000d\u000a      formation. The increase in extensional viscosity was achieved by adding a\u000d\u000a      range of high molecular\u000d\u000a      weight additives at different concentrations to clinical grade silicone\u000d\u000a      oil. The underpinning research\u000d\u000a      was funded by EPSRC (EP\/C546679-1) in 2005-2006 under the post-doctoral\u000d\u000a      mobility scheme to\u000d\u000a      allow Dr Day to use his expertise to address this cross-disciplinary\u000d\u000a      problem.\u000d\u000a    This project demonstrated that modification of standard clinical grade\u000d\u000a      silicone oil tamponade agent\u000d\u000a      (Siluron&#174; 1000, Fluoron GmbH) with a low percentage of a very high\u000d\u000a      molecular weight (423k)\u000d\u000a      polymer of the same chemistry increased the extensional viscosity of the\u000d\u000a      oil and reduced its\u000d\u000a      emulsification [1, 2]. Furthermore, these silicone oil blends have a lower\u000d\u000a      shear viscosity than\u000d\u000a      Siluron&#174; 5000 (Fluoron GmbH), the current high viscosity clinical grade\u000d\u000a      silicone oil, and thus are\u000d\u000a      advantageous in terms of ease of injection into and removal from the eye\u000d\u000a      [3].

The\u000a      blog regularly discusses UCL research, including the progress and\u000a      implementation of the technique described in reference [4], and the key\u000a      background measurements and calibrations. Butterworth posts approximately\u000a      once a week, and the blog attracts a sustained average of about 50,000\u000a      unique visitors a month, with peaks of around 20,000 a day for key posts\u000a      at key times. The Guardian's Editor in Chief said [B]:\u000a    \"The discovery of the Higgs boson was a huge international news story\u000a        with massive interest from readers. Prof Butterworth's insider take on\u000a        the Higgs and his contributions on the field of particle physics in\u000a        general have been integral to the Guardian's science coverage. And his\u000a        blog has been very popular with our online audience.\"\u000a    The Guardian's Assistant National News Editor with special responsibility\u000a      for science, environment and technology said [C]:\u000a    \"The discovery of the Higgs boson was undoubtedly the most important\u000a        pure science story of 2012 and biggest in terms of readership on the\u000a        Guardian's website. This culminated in a rich suite of coverage around\u000a        the discovery announcement in July last year &#8212; including a live blog\u000a        (over 300k page impressions) and video (over 200k) that explains what\u000a        the Higgs boson is in simple terms. [...] And needless to say, the\u000a        announcement dominated the front page of the newspaper.\u000a    \"The Guardian's network of science blogs, of which Prof Butterworth's\u000a        Life and Physics is one, have a very unusual status that is unique in\u000a        Fleet Street.

We recognised when we\u000a        set them up that this area of physics was going to be scientifically\u000a        interesting as well as hugely newsworthy and wanted someone who could\u000a        write from the inside on what the developments in the field really\u000a        meant.

The programme was shortlisted for the EuroPAWS best Science in\u000a      TV Documentaries Award 2012 [G].\u000a    Public events: About 15,000 people attended five shows (Nine\u000a      Lessons and Carols for Godless People, 2011 and 2012; End of the World\u000a      Show, 2012; Science Showoff, 2013; and Feynman Birthday, 2013) at which\u000a      Butterworth and others discussed the Higgs [1, 2]. The End of the World\u000a      Show had an audience of about 3,500 and a ticket price of &#163;25-40.\u000a    Butterworth also contributed to two events held at Latitude Festival in\u000a      2012 about the discovery of the Higgs boson, based on the research in\u000a      references [1] and [2] above. These were an Infinite Monkey Cage event and\u000a      an hour discussion on the Higgs boson in the Literary Tent, and were\u000a      attended by about 8,000 people in total.\u000a    Schools talks: Members of the UCL HEP group also deliver many\u000a      talks in schools, underpinned by their particle physics research. At least\u000a      14 Higgs-related talks have been given since January 2008, reaching\u000a      between 20 and 250 students at a time (approximately 1,000 students in\u000a      total). An example of feedback (from the Head of Physics at Highlands\u000a      School, a state-funded comprehensive in Enfield, London) [H]:\u000a    \"We are very much missing James Monk's contribution to our physics\u000a        students (incidentally we had 12 AS students when you visited us, now we\u000a        have 40).

A major goal\u000a      of ATLAS and the LHC was to understand electroweak symmetry breaking and\u000a      the origin of mass; in the Standard Model the Higgs boson is responsible\u000a      for these phenomena. The LHC began physics operation in late 2009, and on\u000a      4 July 2012 the ATLAS collaboration announced the discovery of a new\u000a      particle, since shown to be a Higgs boson and consistent with the Standard\u000a      Model [1].\u000a    The Higgs boson was discovered by measuring the results of proton-proton\u000a      collisions at the LHC. Many particles are produced in these collisions,\u000a      and identifying the evidence for a new particle, such as the Higgs boson,\u000a      is a huge instrumental and analytical challenge. The High Energy Physics\u000a      (HEP) group, part of UCL's Department of Physics and Astronomy, played a\u000a      major role in this research.\u000a    HEP researchers were involved in constructing ATLAS's detectors [2].

Zyvex now takes that technology to market by\u000d\u000a      developing commercial products in the nanomaterials and nanomanipulation\u000d\u000a      areas. The company has already developed a system that is in wide use\u000d\u000a      throughout the semiconductor industry (a nanoprobe, used to characterise\u000d\u000a      chips at 90nm and below); the UCL research has underpinned development of\u000d\u000a      a new system to be brought to market around 2015. It has also helped\u000d\u000a      generate new employment and $14 million in funding for the company [A].\u000d\u000a    Zyvex Labs is developing techniques to create nanoscale patterns with\u000d\u000a      atomic precision by manipulating hydrogen on Si(001), and then growing new\u000d\u000a      material on top of the patterns.

Both of these systems will allow other\u000d\u000a      companies to produce patterns in hydrogen-terminated Si(001) and grow new\u000d\u000a      materials within the patterns.\u000d\u000a    While developing early ideas for APM based on hydrogen lithography and\u000d\u000a      subsequent growth, the President (at the time Chief Technical Officer\u000d\u000a      followed by Vice President) of Zyvex Labs realised the importance of\u000d\u000a      theoretical underpinning for the process. He writes, \"I did an extensive\u000d\u000a      literature search on the subject. Your theoretical work stood out as the\u000d\u000a      best available data and in excellent agreement with the published\u000d\u000a      experimental data\" [A]. Zyvex Labs and UCL set up a collaboration, under a\u000d\u000a      non-disclosure agreement, in May 2007.\u000d\u000a    UCL's data on hydrogen diffusion and epitaxial growth of silicon improved\u000d\u000a      Zyvex Labs' development process by giving important limits on the\u000d\u000a      atomically precise process being developed: during the early stages of\u000d\u000a      development, in early 2008, it indicated that the approach was feasible;\u000d\u000a      later, it was used to identify the temperatures at which hydrogen becomes\u000d\u000a      mobile, which were used to control and manage the growth processes [A].\u000d\u000a      This last point is particularly important: the growth of new silicon\u000d\u000a      requires elevated temperatures, and so the atomically precise control\u000d\u000a      would be impossible without UCL's data on the temperatures at which the\u000d\u000a      hydrogen mask would degrade. The UCL research findings in section 2 were\u000d\u000a      therefore used to set maximum annealing and growth temperatures for the\u000d\u000a      APM process, to ensure fidelity of patterns. As Zyvex Labs' entire process\u000d\u000a      and hence product relies on control of the position of the atoms on the\u000d\u000a      surface, the UCL results underpin its approach, and hence the products\u000d\u000a      that are being brought to market. The President writes: \"Further, your\u000d\u000a      research on hydrogen mobility on silicon and epitaxial growth of silicon\u000d\u000a      is still very relevant and is referenced on a very regular basis as we are\u000d\u000a      carrying out this research\" [A].\u000d\u000a    In addition to underpinning Zyvex Labs' approach, the UCL research has\u000d\u000a      helped the consortium led by Zyvex Labs to obtain just over $14 million in\u000d\u000a      funding between January 2008 and July 2013 [A]. This consists of two\u000d\u000a      research contracts from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u000d\u000a      and a matching grant from the State of Texas, awarded to enable the\u000d\u000a      accelerated commercialisation and market adoption of atomically precise\u000d\u000a      devices and manufacturing approaches. These contracts started in August\u000d\u000a      2008 and have resulted in the hiring of at least five new employees at\u000d\u000a      Zyvex Labs, including one of the original experimentalists from Oxford\u000d\u000a      [A]. The UCL research underpinned the funding as it enabled Zyvex Labs'\u000d\u000a      development of atomically precise processes, which in turn allowed the\u000d\u000a      contracts to be awarded. The President of Zyvex Labs writes that UCL's\u000d\u000a      \"work on the mobility of hydrogen on silicon surfaces has been enormously\u000d\u000a      influential on the research at Zyvex Labs and the funding of that\u000d\u000a      research\" and that the funding was \"made possible in no small measure by\u000d\u000a      your research\" [A].\u000d\u000a    In 2013, UCL research has also been informing the approaches used by\u000d\u000a      Zyvex Labs in a new area: the development of manufacturing techniques for\u000d\u000a      quantum computing devices. This process will use hydrogen depassivation to\u000d\u000a      deposit dopant atoms with atomic precision, and Zyvex Labs is using the\u000d\u000a      recent UCL research on the electronic structure of dopants on silicon\u000d\u000a      surfaces to understand the effects of physical structure on dopant\u000d\u000a      properties and hence to design the devices [A].

One method of achieving APM involves the growth of\u000d\u000a      structures on the Si(001) surface. A layer of hydrogen on this surface\u000d\u000a      acts as a mask against deposition of further material, so selective\u000d\u000a      removal of hydrogen atoms from the layer enables the selective deposition\u000d\u000a      of new material such as silicon and germanium, as well as dopant atoms for\u000d\u000a      quantum computing devices. The process becomes more complicated, however,\u000d\u000a      if elevated temperatures are required for growth of the new material,\u000d\u000a      since this can also cause hydrogen to diffuse about the surface, reducing\u000d\u000a      the efficiency of the method. The behaviour of hydrogen on the Si(001)\u000d\u000a      surface has therefore become an area of considerable importance, both\u000d\u000a      industrially and academically.\u000d\u000a    UCL research into the behaviour of hydrogen on Si surfaces has been\u000d\u000a      conducted by David Bowler who joined the Department of Physics and\u000d\u000a      Astronomy at UCL in July 1998. This research was part of a collaboration\u000d\u000a      that started whilst Bowler was at Oxford University and continued when he\u000d\u000a      moved to Keele University and then to UCL. The first key UCL contribution\u000d\u000a      (1998-2000) was part of an extensive joint experimental-theoretical\u000d\u000a      investigation with Oxford University of the behaviour of hydrogen on\u000d\u000a      Si(001) under various conditions [1]. In this work, researchers from\u000d\u000a      Oxford University conducted the experimental work, which consisted of\u000d\u000a      elevated-temperature scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) measurements of\u000d\u000a      hydrogen mobility, and UCL's Bowler conducted the theoretical work, which\u000d\u000a      involved modelling the diffusion barrier for hydrogen on Si(001), both on\u000d\u000a      the perfect surface and near step edges and defects. This modelling of\u000d\u000a      hydrogen diffusion gave a comprehensive picture of the energy surface,\u000d\u000a      including the diffusion barriers and the associated temperatures at which\u000d\u000a      hydrogen becomes mobile.\u000d\u000a    The next contribution (2001-2003) was performed entirely at UCL and was\u000d\u000a      relevant both to diffusion of hydrogen and growth of new silicon on\u000d\u000a      Si(001) [2]. This research involved modelling the formation of new Si\u000d\u000a      dimers during growth and hydrogen diffusion associated with this process.\u000d\u000a      Later research (2010-2012) performed by PDRA Veronika Brazdova and\u000d\u000a      supervised by Bowler consisted of modelling the electronic structure of\u000d\u000a      Si(110) [3], and understanding the diffusion of hydrogen on Si(110) [4]\u000d\u000a      and around a Si(001)\/Si(110) corner. The key findings of this research\u000d\u000a      [1-4] hat underpinned the impact were the diffusion barriers for hydrogen\u000d\u000a      on silicon surfaces, both on the perfect surface and near defects and\u000d\u000a      steps.\u000d\u000a    More recently, UCL researchers have studied the effects of physical\u000d\u000a      structure on the electronic structure of dopant atoms on silicon surfaces\u000d\u000a      [5, 6]. The research involved STM experiments and density functional\u000d\u000a      theory (DFT) modelling of dopants on Si(111) [5] and Si(001) [6], and was\u000d\u000a      performed from 2009 to 2013 entirely within UCL. The effect of the\u000d\u000a      physical structure of the dopants on their electronic properties has been\u000d\u000a      found to lead to very different properties to the standard bulk behaviour:\u000d\u000a      on Si(111), Bi has been found to act as both an electron donor and an\u000d\u000a      electron acceptor, while on Si(001), Bi has been found to form a\u000d\u000a      spin-polarised, local state when coupled with a vacancy.

The current annual\u000a      contract value of satellite and support system builds in the UK is around\u000a      &#163;1 billion. Around half of the European upstream space sector serves the\u000a      production (under contract) of world-class science satellites devoted to\u000a      space science and earth observation. These contracts, worth hundreds of\u000a      millions of pounds, provide revenue and employment but also, more\u000a      importantly, underpin the growth of the civil space sector\u000a      (telecommunications, GPS etc.) through transfer of technology and\u000a      personnel. This symbiotic relationship has been widely recognised; for\u000a      example, in the UK Space Innovation and Growth Strategy (IGS) [A] and the\u000a      UK Space Agency Civil Space Strategy [B]. The IGS was published in 2010\u000a      and is the outcome of a major UK government initiative. It provides a\u000a      framework for space sector government support and investment up to 2030,\u000a      and recognises the strength of the UK space sector. Amongst other things,\u000a      it defines an approach that will see the UK's share of the world space\u000a      market increase to 10% by 2020, and it anticipates the creation of 100,000\u000a      jobs [A]. MSSL's role in the space sector has included the provision, in a\u000a      competitive marketplace, of essential skills and technologies as part of\u000a      major satellite procurements, thereby enabling growth.\u000a    UCL researcher Alan Smith is a member of the National Space Technology\u000a      Steering Group (NSTSG), which was set up in 2010 after publication of the\u000a      IGS. In 2011, the NSTSG created technology roadmaps (updated in 2012) [C]\u000a      that have become the basis for national investment in space technology.\u000a      Smith also contributed to the 2013 `Restack' of the IGS, particularly in\u000a      the area of bilateral programmes and their value to the UK economy, and\u000a      presented on this topic to the UK community at the UK Space Conference in\u000a      Glasgow in July 2013. These contributions and presentations are\u000a      underpinned by a profound understanding of the issues associated with the\u000a      development of space hardware and the link between space science and its\u000a      enabling technology, which has been built up whilst conducting the\u000a      research described in section 2.\u000a    Research conducted within MSSL has also had an impact on the space\u000a      companies European Astrium Aerospace and Canadian Routes AstroEngineering,\u000a      which hold contracts with space agencies &#8212; including the European Space\u000a      Agency (ESA) &#8212; for the supply and testing of equipment that will form part\u000a      of satellites or space probes. Astrium and Routes in turn contracted out\u000a      this work to MSSL, whose extensive prior research into the development and\u000a      testing of space equipment enabled it to successfully meet the\u000a      requirements of the space companies. MSSL's contribution therefore enabled\u000a      Astrium and Routes to fulfil their contracts to the space agencies.\u000a    The research programmes and insights described in section 2 gave MSSL the\u000a      background, expertise and track record to win the contracts with Astrium\u000a      and Routes through competitive tender, evidencing the value of the\u000a      underpinning research to these companies. The scientific background of\u000a      MSSL staff also allows the response to the customer's requirements to be\u000a      interpreted to the best advantage of the customer; issues can be\u000a      identified in the specifications that would not necessarily be noted by\u000a      another contractor without MSSL's scientific and space engineering\u000a      heritage.\u000a    Astrium: Impacts on Astrium involved three contracts within the\u000a      REF impact period to supply or test equipment for two scheduled space\u000a      missions: the NASA\/ESA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST, the replacement\u000a      for the Hubble Space Telescope), due to be launched in 2018; and Gaia\u000a      (ESA's next generation astrometry mission to map the Galaxy), due to be\u000a      launched in late 2013.\u000a    The JWST work involved the building of equipment for both on-board\u000a      calibration (the Calibration Assembly, or CAA) and ground testing\u000a      (Calibration Light Source and Optical Alignment equipment) of the\u000a      telescope's NIRSpec instrument, which is being built by the German arm of\u000a      Astrium. Two CAA units were built for Astrium by MSSL, where previous\u000a      extensive research into space instrument development (including\u000a      development of NIRSpec itself) allowed staff to understand fully the\u000a      scientific requirements and develop the instruments successfully. The CAA\u000a      is an example of an instrument for which MSSL was able to provide industry\u000a      with specialist expertise in inflight, stable, optical calibration that\u000a      was not otherwise available. UCL won the contract in part because of this\u000a      expertise, which significantly reduced the risk to Astrium of late or\u000a      inferior delivery of the instrument. Astrium took delivery of the\u000a      equipment in February 2010, enabling them to then successfully deliver two\u000a      flight-capable CAA units to ESA [D].\u000a    The Calibration Light Source and Optical Alignment equipment are two\u000a      separate instruments (a calibrated infra-red light source and a\u000a      computer-controlled optical alignment and measurement system) used for\u000a      testing NIRSpec before launch. They were also built by MSSL, underpinned\u000a      by previous research on the development of optical systems and test\u000a      facilities (e.g. [1], [2]) for space missions as well as research on\u000a      NIRSpec. Again, UCL research results (including novel calibration\u000a      technologies) were vital for Astrium to be able to provide ESA with\u000a      successful working equipment, as Astrium had developed complex equipment\u000a      requirements that other industrial bidders were not able to meet. Astrium\u000a      took delivery of the equipment in December 2009 [D]. These two UCL\u000a      contracts on NIRSpec [text removed for publication] played a role in\u000a      allowing Astrium to meet the terms of its contract with ESA [text removed\u000a      for publication] [D].\u000a    The Gaia work involved the testing and integration of over 100 CCDs and\u000a      their associated electronics for the Gaia mission, which is being built by\u000a      the French arm of Astrium. This work was underpinned by previous MSSL\u000a      research involving both the development of the Gaia instrument concept [4]\u000a      and the integration and testing of CCD-based camera systems (e.g. for the\u000a      XMM [1], Integral and Hinode [2] missions). The extensive research and\u000a      experience of MSSL in this area resulted in properly tested CCD units\u000a      being delivered to ESA by Astrium, and provided Astrium with validated\u000a      test results that were acceptable to ESA [F]. Astrium took delivery of the\u000a      final tested units in May 2011, helping it to meet the terms of its\u000a      contract with ESA [F], which had a value of &#8364;317 million [G]. [text\u000a      removed for publication]\u000a    Routes AstroEngineering: Impact on the Canadian Routes space\u000a      company involved one contract within the REF impact period with the Indian\u000a      government to supply equipment for the Indian Astrosat mission, due to be\u000a      launched in 2014. MSSL built the high voltage power supplies for\u000a      Astrosat's UV telescope, equipment that will support the image\u000a      intensifiers that detect UV radiation from astronomical objects under\u000a      study; Routes took delivery of this equipment in September 2009 [H].\u000a      MSSL's previous research on the development of high voltage power supplies\u000a      (e.g. [1], [5]) ensured that Routes was able to deliver appropriate\u000a      equipment that met the requirements set by the Indian government. If MSSL\u000a      had not conducted this underpinning research into the development of novel\u000a      power supplies and therefore become one of the few organisations with\u000a      design heritage from previous projects, Routes would likely have had to\u000a      initiate a high-risk (due to reduced expertise) development at another\u000a      organisation [H]. The value of the UCL contract was &#163;417,000 [I].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UCL's research and development programme in space science and engineering\u000a      enabled it to complete four major contracts with European and Canadian\u000a      space companies between 2009 and 2011. These contracts were for the supply\u000a      of equipment that will fly on European and Indian space missions, and for\u000a      support of the ground testing of those space missions. The fact that these\u000a      contracts were won by UCL in a competitive environment against low-cost\u000a      industrial providers demonstrates that customers value the capability that\u000a      UCL possesses. By acting as a specialist provider within the UK space\u000a      sector supply chain, UCL enabled the prime contractors European Astrium\u000a      Aerospace and Canadian Routes AstroEngineering Ltd. to deliver substantial\u000a      commercial contracts with space agencies. Its provision of specialist\u000a      input into these major contracts enabled UCL to also directly support the\u000a      growth of the commercial space sector.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    University College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] The XMM-Newton optical\/UV monitor telescope, K.

Major contributions to this\u000a      research since 1993 include:\u000a    The development of instrumentation for use on spacecraft: A\u000a      primary function of MSSL is to design and build space instruments and\u000a      associated on-board software to meet the scientific objectives set by the\u000a      investigators. The development of such instrumentation involves a platform\u000a      of research both in the subject area of the science mission (such as\u000a      astrophysics) and the instrumentation necessary to deliver new science.\u000a      Research outcomes included successful system designs, and mechanical and\u000a      electronic designs for space; fabrication, test and calibration of many\u000a      instruments; and a full engineering understanding of science requirements\u000a      [1-4]. Particular insights involved the trade-off of various noise sources\u000a      that contributed to the ultimate performance of a microchannel-based\u000a      detector (the XMM mission, launched in 1999 [1]), and the lifetime\u000a      estimation of electron and ion detectors in systems operating in the\u000a      Earth's magnetosphere (the Cluster mission, launched in 2000). This\u000a      programme of research involved the following key UCL researchers and space\u000a      missions\/instruments: Prof. Culhane (SOHO, 1995), Prof. Johnstone (Polar,\u000a      1996), Prof. Coates (Cassini, 1997), Prof. Mason (XMM, 1999 [1]; Swift,\u000a      2006), Prof. Fazakerley (Cluster, 2000; Double Star, 2004), Prof. Smith\u000a      (Integral, 2002), Prof. Harra (Hinode, 2006 [2]), Prof. Page (Herschel,\u000a      2009) and Prof. Cropper (NIRSpec for JWST, 2000; Gaia, due for launch late\u000a      2013 [3]). For brevity only the lead scientists are shown in the above\u000a      list.\u000a    Development of high voltage power supplies for multiple science\u000a        instruments: High voltage supplies are integral to a number of\u000a      detectors used in space science, particularly image intensifiers (for\u000a      example, those used on the satellites XMM, launched in 1999, and Swift,\u000a      launched in 2004) and particle detector microchannel plates (for example,\u000a      those used on the satellites Cluster, launched in 2000, and Double Star,\u000a      launched in 2004). MSSL has developed the capability to design and build\u000a      bespoke high voltage power supplies to meet the requirements of industrial\u000a      customers; for example, it built the power supply for the XMM mission that\u000a      was launched in 1999 [1]. Important advancements included making the\u000a      supplies small, lightweight, and power efficient; and the development of\u000a      supplies that can very rapidly sweep across wide voltage values, which is\u000a      required for key applications such as particle detectors for missions to\u000a      Saturn and the Sun, the energy\/time cadence of which depends critically on\u000a      the sweep rate. Key UCL researchers were Jim Bowles (Head of Electronics\u000a      Group, 1990-1997) and Phil Guttridge (Head of Electronics Group,\u000a      1997-present).\u000a    Development of novel test facilities for multiple science missions:\u000a      All items of equipment for space instruments have to be calibrated under\u000a      vacuum, while being illuminated with light or stimulated with charged\u000a      particles to demonstrate their function. The high accuracy of the required\u000a      calibration needs a close understanding of the physics of the stimulating\u000a      radiation and the design needed to achieve that; for example,\u000a      high-accuracy optical flat fields and electron\/proton beams.\u000a    Additionally, the temperature of the equipment has to be varied across a\u000a      wide range to show that it has been built correctly and is able to\u000a      maintain the correct performance in the harsh conditions in space. To\u000a      achieve these aims, MSSL has developed many specialist test systems that\u000a      were designed or adapted for individual mission requirements and has\u000a      developed the capability to respond to the needs of industrial customers.\u000a      An evolving programme of development has been in place since before 1993\u000a      and has included the commissioning of specialist facilities for Cluster\u000a      (~1995) and CCD (charge coupled device) based missions (e.g. Integral\u000a      ~1998). Calibration facilities require traceability to national standards\u000a      and extremely accurate characterisation. In general, the physical\u000a      processes associated with the facility have to be understood at least as\u000a      well as the instrumentation that is being calibrated, and so such\u000a      developments have required modelling and model verification. For instance,\u000a      when the Cassini instrument required a stable ion beam in 1995, UCL\u000a      researchers modelled magnetic field distortion within a thermal vacuum\u000a      chamber [4], together with the development of magnetic shielding\u000a      provisions and beam monitors.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34173","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, TMG has disseminated its expertise in systems engineering\u000d\u000a      through its portfolio of training courses, with resulting improvements in\u000d\u000a      performance and competitiveness of a range of companies, including some of\u000d\u000a      the world's largest aerospace, defence and engineering companies.

Teaching on\u000d\u000a      these courses involves a mix of interactive lectures, discussions of case\u000d\u000a      studies, group exercises and dynamic simulations of projects, and is\u000d\u000a      underpinned by the principles derived from the TMG's experience in space\u000d\u000a      instrument developments and their research into systems engineering\u000d\u000a      practice. There is a common focus on delivering value in the face of\u000d\u000a      unpredictable or changing requirements, as today's complex projects\u000d\u000a      demand.\u000d\u000a    All of the courses seek to share theory and best practice in the\u000d\u000a      management of technology projects, including technology decision-making,\u000d\u000a      risk management, and ensuring projects are well-managed, maximising the\u000d\u000a      chance of completion on time, to budget and with the quality envisaged.\u000d\u000a      This training reduces the risk of major project failure (overspend, late\u000d\u000a      delivery, inadequate functionality and failure in service). This is\u000d\u000a      particularly important for the TMG's customer organisations, which operate\u000d\u000a      in sectors where very large and complex systems are developed; the\u000d\u000a      complexity of such systems and the nature of the development approach make\u000d\u000a      them very susceptible to huge cost overruns. For example, in a project led\u000d\u000a      by BAE Systems, the Royal Navy's Astute class nuclear submarine programme\u000d\u000a      is now expected to finish over seven years late and &#163;1.3 billion over\u000d\u000a      budget; problems the company has had with projects like this are a key\u000d\u000a      justification for investing in the TMG's training courses.\u000d\u000a    One indicator of impact is the overall cost of the training to the\u000d\u000a      company, which includes direct costs (charged by UCL) and the staff-time\u000d\u000a      of delegates (salary assumed to be &#163;100,000 per delegate including\u000d\u000a      overheads). The direct costs are &#163;634,000 and the staff costs are &#163;1.748\u000d\u000a      million giving a total over the period of almost &#163;2.4 million. Companies\u000d\u000a      have been prepared to invest this level of resource with an expectation\u000d\u000a      that this will lead to an improved performance and greater profitability.\u000d\u000a      For the type of training offered, providing proof of the link between\u000d\u000a      training course delivery and company performance is difficult, but there\u000d\u000a      is a large amount of repeat business, with several of the customers having\u000d\u000a      been using the courses throughout the five-year period covered.\u000d\u000a    One company that has made increasing use of the training courses is Ultra\u000d\u000a      Electronics. This company, with around 5,000 employees worldwide,\u000d\u000a      identified the need for systems engineering training following a number of\u000d\u000a      engineering `near misses' that could have resulted in fatalities.\u000d\u000a      Initially (in 2008), Ultra just asked the TMG to provide systems\u000d\u000a      engineering training courses in the UK. This service was subsequently\u000d\u000a      extended to North America, and, since 2011, TMG has also provided project\u000d\u000a      management courses in the UK and US, and occasional consultancy services.\u000d\u000a      Over 200 Ultra engineers, managers and directors have now received\u000d\u000a      training, and 26 courses have been delivered since 2008 [A]. The company's\u000d\u000a      Chairman has commented on the value of the courses to his company, saying:\u000d\u000a      \"the feedback from Ultra's engineers has been extremely positive and in my\u000d\u000a      view has had a significant beneficial effect on Ultra's engineering\u000d\u000a      capabilities\", and that \"through the adoption of best practice, senior\u000d\u000a      management has the confidence to compete for large engineering programmes\u000d\u000a      without the necessity of including excessive contingencies in competitive\u000d\u000a      bids. As a result the company has been successful in securing more\u000d\u000a      business through competition and which it has executed successfully and\u000d\u000a      continues to do so. A proof of the effectiveness and value of this\u000d\u000a      activity is that Professor Smith's courses continue to be offered to\u000d\u000a      Ultra's personnel\" [A]. He also noted that the consultancy Professor Smith\u000d\u000a      provided to support project reviews had led to \"significant improvement in\u000d\u000a      Ultra's Systems Engineering capability with consequent positive impact on\u000d\u000a      the Group's competitiveness\" [A]. Ultra also recommended the service to\u000d\u000a      Mahindra [A], a major Indian partner of theirs, and the TMG has provided\u000d\u000a      training and consultancy to them on two occasions in 2012\/13. Repeat\u000d\u000a      business and deepening of relationships like this are strong indicators\u000d\u000a      that customers believe that the benefits to their organisations of using\u000d\u000a      the training courses is greater than the costs they incur in doing so.\u000d\u000a    Selex ES, an international electronics company, has also benefited from\u000d\u000a      the training. Eleven courses have been provided for 176 trainees in the\u000d\u000a      last three years at sites in Luton, Basildon and Edinburgh. A range of\u000d\u000a      courses in Engineering for Complex Systems has been developed and\u000d\u000a      delivered at foundation, experienced and senior management levels. Selex's\u000d\u000a      Head of Systems &amp; Supportability Engineering (UK) stated: \"It is clear\u000d\u000a      that the training is adding huge benefits to the company in many ways\"\u000d\u000a      [B]. The impacts on Selex that he identified include \"The message of\u000d\u000a      Systems Thinking and using the principles to add value to the wider\u000d\u000a      company is gradually percolating to senior managers. Last year we used\u000d\u000a      such principles to actually redesign part of our organisation and\u000d\u000a      processes\"; \"Engineers understanding that they have more than a technical\u000d\u000a      role to play (leadership, schedule, cost, etc.)\"; \"There is a wider\u000d\u000a      cross-discipline appreciation of SE principles and of each other's\u000d\u000a      discipline too\"; and \"Engineers are becoming aware that the old way of\u000d\u000a      thinking isn't enough today. Just that realisation is significant as they\u000d\u000a      are asking questions or performing additional analysis that wouldn't\u000d\u000a      normally be done\" [B].\u000d\u000a    Another organisation within which the training has led to changes in\u000d\u000a      knowledge, capabilities and behaviour is General Dynamics UK. Eleven\u000d\u000a      courses have been provided to 143 trainees since 2009 in Newbridge, South\u000d\u000a      Wales, in the subjects of Systems Engineering and Systems Design. The\u000d\u000a      company's Learning and Organisational Development Consultant reported\u000d\u000a      comments from employees who benefited from training, including \"I now see\u000d\u000a      the systems as a whole and how the small part I am working on fits into\u000d\u000a      the bigger picture\", \"I understand that applying process and systems into\u000d\u000a      daily working practice can improve work output\" and \"Understanding of\u000d\u000a      process has meant that I have been able to work more efficiently\" [C]. The\u000d\u000a      improved knowledge and skills have benefited four General Dynamics UK\u000d\u000a      projects: Joint System Integration Body, Scout SV Video Server, Bowman\u000d\u000a      Long Term Support Services, and New Integrated Marines Communication and\u000d\u000a      Information System.\u000d\u000a    A web-based training course in Technology Risk Management was developed\u000d\u000a      for BP in 2008 and several evening lectures have been provided over the\u000d\u000a      last five years to support a University of Manchester course. BP \"found\u000d\u000a      UCL's support to be of high quality and valuable\", reporting that \"over\u000d\u000a      the past few years, BP has become much, much better at understanding\u000d\u000a      technology risks in the context of the facilities and equipment it needs\u000d\u000a      to develop. The importance of this cannot be overstated. As our industry\u000d\u000a      has found many times, the costs associated with recovering from a failed\u000d\u000a      piece of technology far outweigh the costs of the initial investment in\u000d\u000a      planning the appropriate technology development and well-managed\u000d\u000a      implementation. The many discussions and activities between UCL and BP\u000d\u000a      over the years have demonstrated that UCL possesses unique skills and\u000d\u000a      experience that are relevant to BP now and in the future. It is also able\u000d\u000a      to work flexibly with our large organization, an important attribute in\u000d\u000a      itself.\" [D]\u000d\u000a    Impacts on practitioners and professional bodies: Based on their\u000d\u000a      knowledge and experience of systems engineering, underpinned by the\u000d\u000a      research in references [1] to [5] above, three TMG members were selected\u000d\u000a      to chair or otherwise take part in the International Council on Systems\u000d\u000a      Engineering (INCOSE) working group on the core competencies of systems\u000d\u000a      engineering, and contributed significant insights to this group. The\u000d\u000a      Systems Engineering Competency Framework that was developed was adopted\u000d\u000a      worldwide by INCOSE in 2010 [E], including in the professional\u000d\u000a      certification of systems engineers. It has been rolled out across a number\u000d\u000a      of companies as a basis for career development and standardisation of\u000d\u000a      systems engineering practice; major organisations that have used the\u000d\u000a      framework include Thales, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Atego, Bombardier\u000d\u000a      and the Ministry of Defence [F].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Technology Management Group (TMG) in the Department of Space and\u000d\u000a      Climate Physics (also known as the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, or\u000d\u000a      MSSL) at UCL has developed a range of professional training courses for\u000d\u000a      industry that promote a forward-looking approach to the management of\u000d\u000a      technology projects. Industrial customers have invested almost &#163;2.4\u000d\u000a      million on the training within the REF impact period, greatly valuing its\u000d\u000a      impact in helping their staff deal with the challenges of modern, complex\u000d\u000a      projects, such as achieving high reliability in network-enabled systems\u000d\u000a      that need to perform in the harshest environments.

Systems\u000d\u000a      engineering as a discipline owes much to seminal work undertaken by NASA;\u000d\u000a      however, in many cases the rigorous formality of a NASA approach is\u000d\u000a      inappropriate to a particular system development and more pragmatic\u000d\u000a      solutions have to be found. UCL's MSSL has gained a high level of\u000d\u000a      competence in this area and has developed numerous insights on how to\u000d\u000a      deliver successful projects in the most demanding of environments.\u000d\u000a    These insights into systems engineering have arisen from MSSL's programme\u000d\u000a      of instrument development for space science applications, which has been\u000d\u000a      running since 1959 and has particularly developed in this area since 1993.\u000d\u000a      Each development programme involves the management and engineering of a\u000d\u000a      complex instrument system, often as the Principal Investigator group\u000d\u000a      within an international consortium of institutes and an industrial supply\u000d\u000a      chain. Starting from the early 2000s, after many of these space projects\u000d\u000a      UCL's TMG conducted interviews with the project managers and systems\u000d\u000a      engineers to review their experiences. In January 2010, the TMG undertook\u000d\u000a      a project to consolidate their findings formally, in order to provide a\u000d\u000a      more coherent expression of best practice in project management and\u000d\u000a      systems engineering. This project drew on the interviews and also involved\u000d\u000a      an intensive three-day workshop in which TMG staff and programme managers\u000d\u000a      identified the influences that made the greatest impact on the outcomes of\u000d\u000a      MSSL projects. From an initial brainstorm of issues, a shortlist of common\u000d\u000a      themes was identified, and from these themes it was found that a set of\u000d\u000a      five orthogonal `principles' were needed to cover the most important\u000d\u000a      issues: `principles govern process', `seek alternative systems\u000d\u000a      perspectives', `understand the enterprise context', `integrate systems\u000d\u000a      engineering and project management', and `invest in the early stages of\u000d\u000a      projects'. Behind these principles is a will to anticipate and respond to\u000d\u000a      a changing environment with a focus on achieving long-term value for the\u000d\u000a      enterprise. They were presented at the 2012 International Systems\u000d\u000a      Engineering Symposium and in a journal article [1], and are now applied in\u000d\u000a      both space projects and non-space projects at MSSL.\u000d\u000a    An example of an experience that the TMG drew upon to formulate their\u000d\u000a      five principles comes from the area of design qualification. In space\u000d\u000a      projects, environmental qualification of a design is usually an essential\u000d\u000a      part of the development process and involves subjecting a test item to\u000d\u000a      higher levels of stress than it would be expected to experience during\u000d\u000a      launch. Ideally, this involves building a special item purely for testing\u000d\u000a      and then discarding it, since the testing process may have weakened it,\u000d\u000a      i.e. the design rather than the test item is qualified. To save resources,\u000d\u000a      an increasingly common (\"protoflight\") approach is to test the actual\u000d\u000a      flight hardware, but to a lower level (still above flight levels), i.e. to\u000d\u000a      qualify the item rather than the design. When an item fails either type of\u000d\u000a      qualification test, the formal process demands repair and retest; however,\u000d\u000a      repair would take time and resources and repetition of testing could\u000d\u000a      degrade the strength below a flight-acceptable level. At this point, it is\u000d\u000a      important to remember that the testing process is meant to reduce risk,\u000d\u000a      not increase it. In a number of MSSL projects, items have failed testing;\u000d\u000a      for example, during a protoflight vibration test, several components on a\u000d\u000a      printed circuit board became detached. On analysis, it was discovered that\u000d\u000a      all had a common and simple mounting problem. Rather than risk weakening\u000d\u000a      other components with a full retest, the board was repaired and tested at\u000d\u000a      a much lower level with the full agreement of the space agency involved (a\u000d\u000a      second failure would have set the project back two months while a new item\u000d\u000a      was built and tested). This is one of the examples that inspired the\u000d\u000a      `principles govern process' principle.\u000d\u000a    Further insights into systems engineering have arisen from MSSL's\u000d\u000a      research into (a) the impact of technology decisions in the\u000d\u000a      instrumentation supply chain, with a focus on the pharmaceutical and\u000d\u000a      agricultural sectors (2002-05) [2, 3]; (b) the costs and benefits of\u000d\u000a      introducing new technology in transport (2008-11); and (c) improving the\u000d\u000a      understanding across industry sectors of terminology used in systems\u000d\u000a      engineering and systems architecting (2011) [4, 5]. Each project has led\u000d\u000a      to significant insights that have been integrated into the training\u000d\u000a      courses delivered by the TMG. For example, project (a) led to the\u000d\u000a      development of a methodology for mapping future technology needs and\u000d\u000a      capabilities, project (b) led to the insight that value for money (over\u000d\u000a      the lifecycle) is often overlooked in technology development projects, and\u000d\u000a      project (c) led to the insight that a lack of standard systems engineering\u000d\u000a      terminology is hampering understanding in UK industry.\u000d\u000a    Key UCL researchers: Alan Smith (Professor of Detector Physics\u000d\u000a      1998-present) and Michael Emes (Research Associate 2002-2005; Senior\u000d\u000a      Research Associate 2005-October 2013; Principal Research Associate October\u000d\u000a      2013-present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34174","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    MSSL research findings have led to a high level of public interest and\u000d      demand for public engagement activities related to the specific research\u000d      described in section 2. Within the REF impact period, MSSL researchers\u000d      have been invited to speak at numerous public and school events and have\u000d      received a large volume of requests for media interviews and other media\u000d      engagement activities.\u000d    Schools talks: Seventy talks were delivered by Green to over\u000d      20,000 school students between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2013. Audiences\u000d      ranged in size from 30 to 1,500 people and included both primary and\u000d      secondary school students. The talks covered a range of research that was\u000d      conducted at MSSL, including an overview of the research in references [1]\u000d      and [4] above. On-going relationships were formed with a number of schools\u000d      in the south of England; for example, St. Teresa's school in Effingham,\u000d      Surrey, and Thomas Hardye School in Dorchester, Dorset. Both of these\u000d      schools have benefited from repeat visits from Green and other researchers\u000d      and engineers at MSSL. As well as talks given in the schools, MSSL also\u000d      hosted visits from school groups and delivered talks at the laboratory\u000d      itself. A selection of feedback [A] demonstrates that the talks have\u000d      inspired students, stimulated their interest in science, and improved\u000d      their knowledge and understanding of the topics:\u000d    \"Years 5 and 6 were hugely inspired by a presentation at St Teresa's\u000d        from Dr Lucie Green, which provided an excellent start to our National\u000d        Science Week activities. They found her talk on the Sun, Solar System\u000d        and other stars absolutely fascinating, prompting them to ask plenty of\u000d        questions. [...] Our Year 5 groups have been visiting Lucie at the\u000d        Mullard Laboratory for several years now. This is a popular and highly\u000d        valuable trip, which supports the girls' science studies on the Earth,\u000d        Sun and Moon physics topic. We appreciate this exciting link with the\u000d        scientists at Mullard and are incredibly grateful for its significant\u000d        contribution to the education of our girls.\"\u000d    \"The students (and staff!) at The Thomas Hardye School in Dorset have\u000d        been very fortunate to benefit from several high-quality enrichment\u000d        opportunities presented by scientists and engineers from the Mullard\u000d        Space Science Laboratory since 2008. Year 9 and Year 10 students were\u000d        able to quiz Dr Lucie Green at a \"Meet the Scientists\" event [...] As a\u000d        result, students have found their pre-conceptions about scientist [...]\u000d        stereotypes altered in a positive way. [...] Dr Green returned in\u000d        February 2013 to impress a packed audience of more than 500 people drawn\u000d        from the community and school with \"Solar Max\". The numbers of THS\u000d        students taking science (especially physics) [...] beyond school have\u000d        increased steadily over the intervening years &#8212; the impact of meeting\u000d        cutting-edge inspirational scientists [...] who have a passion for their\u000d        subject is invaluable in helping the school make students aware of\u000d        cross-curricular STEM subjects and the myriad of career possibilities\u000d        that they offer.\"\u000d    Science education: From 2008 onwards, MSSL's Green developed a\u000d      series of teaching resources [B] to aid delivery of the primary and\u000d      secondary school science curricula by teachers. These resources, which are\u000d      underpinned by Green's research and experience at MSSL, provide practical\u000d      ideas for bringing Solar System science into the classroom and enable\u000d      teachers to illustrate their teaching with examples from current research.\u000d      They were one of the top 25 resources downloaded through the ESERO\u000d      (European Space Education Resource Office) section of the National STEM\u000d      Centre eLibrary website in the 2012 autumn term [B], and continue to be\u000d      amongst the website's `Most Popular' resources [C]. Teachers have found\u000d      the resources to be very effective, with feedback from one reviewer on the\u000d      website including: \"The Sunspots activity worked excellently with my year\u000d      9 GCSE Astronomy class. It is a straightforward task that produces a clear\u000d      result and by combining the information from the graphs it is clear there\u000d      is a pattern to the sunspot cycle but variation in this pattern. It was\u000d      very good for showing the advantages of displaying data in graphs rather\u000d      than tables and for building up graphs skills, which is something I'm\u000d      always surprised at the number of students who struggle with it.\" [C]\u000d    Green also delivered talks during the REF impact period to a total of\u000d      around 300 school teachers at continuing professional development (CPD)\u000d      events. These talks covered the basics of the Sun and observing the Sun\u000d      from space using missions for which MSSL has supplied instrumentation, as\u000d      well as the research findings in references [1-4] above. Activities\u000d      included delivering the Association for Science Education keynote John\u000d      Lewis lecture in January 2012, delivering the Institute of Physics (IoP)\u000d      keynote lecture in July 2012, speaking at the ESERO Space Education Day of\u000d      the UK Space Conference in July 2011, and speaking at the Prince's\u000d      Teaching Institute in March 2010. Her input enabled the teachers to take\u000d      current MSSL research (that in references [1], [2] and [4] above) into the\u000d      classroom and to develop new lesson plans. Feedback collated in the\u000d      evaluation of the IoP keynote lecture included: \"The keynote speaker was\u000d      fantastic &#8212; I have a lesson in mind for year 7s who are very interested in\u000d      the solar system\" and \"Fantastic start with such enthusiasm &#8212; info on sun\u000d      was excellent, possibly best ever!\" [D]\u000d    The ESERO Space Education Day was attended by 25 primary school teachers\u000d      and 69 secondary school teachers from across Britain. Evaluation of the\u000d      day as a whole found that teachers \"were overwhelmingly positive about\u000d      their experiences of attending the event\" [E], and that the event was\u000d      valuable as it connected teachers with expert speakers who provided\u000d      information about current developments in space science together with ways\u000d      to use this information in the classroom [E].\u000d    Public talks: Over 60 public talks were given on MSSL research\u000d      (references [1-4] above) during the REF impact period, including repeat\u000d      visits made to adult education societies, astronomical societies and the\u000d      Cheltenham Science Festival (2010-13). Other events included Astrofest in\u000d      February 2012 and a public UCL Lunch Hour Lecture, delivered by Green in\u000d      November 2011 about her research (references [1], [2] and [4] above). The\u000d      total audience reached through these events is many thousands and is\u000d      composed mainly of adult and family audiences; for example, Astrofest was\u000d      attended mainly by adults and had an audience size of one thousand, and\u000d      the Lunch Hour Lecture had an audience of over one thousand (direct and\u000d      online webcast).\u000d    Public talks delivered by MSSL researchers have also resulted in on-going\u000d      and sustained relationships with the local community. Feedback from the\u000d      audience after a community talk about solar physics given by Green at\u000d      Thomas Hardye School in February 2013 indicated that public interest had\u000d      been stimulated and understanding of the topic had been increased, and\u000d      included the following comment: \"The fascinating insight into your work\u000d      was portrayed in such an illuminating manner (apologies for the pun) that\u000d      even a layman like myself could feel a degree of understanding (well, at\u000d      least for the basics!), and your enthusiasm is infectious &#8212; I seem to be\u000d      developing a curious fondness for solar magnetic flux ropes, of all\u000d      things!\" [F]\u000d    In addition to attending MSSL's public talks, members of the local\u000d      community visit the department on open days. The 2009 open day was\u000d      attended by 220 people from the local area. Evaluation of the event showed\u000d      that visitors \"had had their awareness of the space science that occurs\u000d      locally raised\" [G], and that 53% and 27% of visitors rated their learning\u000d      about space science and the work at MSSL as `very high' and `a lot'\u000d      respectively. Their overall enjoyment of the day was rated as `very high'\u000d      by 83% of visitors [G].\u000d    Online content: A video discussing Green's research area, and the\u000d      upcoming solar space missions that she is involved with, was recorded in\u000d      collaboration with the UK's Astronomy Now magazine in April 2011. This\u000d      video received over 1,700 views on YouTube between April 2011 and 31 July\u000d      2013 [H]. Green also discusses her research on her personal website, which\u000d      was visited by 30,000 unique visitors during the last three years (up to\u000d      31 July 2013). Most visitors were from Europe, with a smaller percentage\u000d      from North America, South America, Africa and Japan. The number of unique\u000d      visitors has increased year on year: there were 2,675 in 2010, 8,578 in\u000d      2011, 12,110 in 2012, and 6,677 in the first seven months of 2013 [I].\u000d      This increase in online visitors demonstrates an increase in public\u000d      interest in Green's work.\u000d    Media activities: The various public engagement activities\u000d      mentioned above stimulated interest among the media, which has led to\u000d      increased demand for expert comment from Green on solar physics research\u000d      and its relation to space weather and Solar System physics, in addition to\u000d      on-going relationships with journalists and producers. For example, Green\u000d      presented a BBC Radio 4 programme on space weather (Solar Max, broadcast\u000d      April 2013) and has given expert comment in many interviews regarding\u000d      solar activity and space weather.\u000d    Insurance industry: MSSL research (references [1-3] above) has\u000d      been disseminated to the insurance industry and to the growing UK space\u000d      weather community; for example, Green visited the Met Office in July 2011\u000d      to discuss her research results and their relevance. The visit involved\u000d      the small team who were responsible for developing the space weather\u000d      activity at the Met Office at that time and has led to on-going\u000d      engagement. Talks discussing flux ropes and their potential for use to\u000d      predict space weather were also delivered by Green at two events for\u000d      insurance industry employees: the EQECAT London conference in May 2011 and\u000d      the IUA (International Underwriting Association) Catastrophe Risk\u000d      Management Conference in October 2012. This dissemination has led to an\u000d      increased understanding amongst these communities of how space weather\u000d      events could affect the insurance industry and of what steps they need to\u000d      take to minimise the impact on business operations and earnings. Feedback\u000d      from the IUA event showed that Green's talk was by far the highest rated\u000d      of the conference (84% of respondents rated it as `excellent') [J], with\u000d      the attendees greatly valuing the science and its importance in the\u000d      emerging risk of space weather. This positive feedback has led to Green\u000d      being an invited speaker at the IUA's 2013 event and to on-going dialogue\u000d      with several of the 2012 conference attendees. A further outcome of MSSL's\u000d      interaction with these communities is a national meeting being held in\u000d      December 2013 that will bring together MSSL academics with the Met Office,\u000d      the National Grid and the insurance industry to discuss future\u000d      collaborations.\u000d    While the impacts focus on UCL contributions, they are also underpinned\u000d      by a wide body of solar physics research that was conducted over many\u000d      years by research teams in many institutions worldwide. These other\u000d      institutions therefore share in the credit for the impact generated.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    UCL's discoveries of the existence of magnetic flux ropes in the solar\u000d      atmosphere and their link to sunquake generation have stimulated public\u000d      interest in science and led to a large volume of engagement activities.\u000d      Since 2008, there has been a high demand for public and schools talks\u000d      related to research conducted by staff within the Department of Space and\u000d      Climate Physics &#8212; also known as the Mullard Space Science Laboratory\u000d      (MSSL) &#8212; with attendees being inspired and gaining increased knowledge.\u000d      Teaching resources and talks at teacher training events have enabled\u000d      teachers to include MSSL research in inspirational science lessons.\u000d      Sustained and on-going relationships have been developed with local\u000d      schools, adult education groups, the media and the local community; for\u000d      example, at the 2009 MSSL open day visitors from the local area benefited\u000d      from raised awareness and improved knowledge about space science.\u000d    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d    University College London (UCL)\u000d    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d    \u000a[1] Flux rope formation preceding coronal mass ejection onset, L.

The experimental data used in this research, acquired by\u000d      internationally funded and operated space telescopes that have major UK\u000d      hardware contributions, were measurements of the magnetic field at the\u000d      visible surface of the Sun and observations of the magnetic field\u000d      configurations in the solar atmosphere as revealed by plasma emission in\u000d      the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet wavelength ranges. The magnetic\u000d      configuration of CMEs was determined by using these data in combination\u000d      with the latest theoretical approaches to modelling magnetic\u000d      configurations in the solar atmosphere. This approach led to the first\u000d      unambiguous determination of the magnetic configuration of a CME at the\u000d      point of eruption and showed it to be a bundle of twisted magnetic fields\u000d      known as a flux rope [1], answering one of the most outstanding problems\u000d      in solar physics. The results provided a clear observational signature to\u000d      identify flux ropes that exist low in the solar atmosphere and showed the\u000d      mechanism by which flux ropes form before their eruption as a CME. The\u000d      observations were then used to calculate the magnetic flux content of the\u000d      ropes [2], another question of fundamental importance in CME and space\u000d      weather research. MSSL's observational identification and measurements of\u000d      the flux content of the ropes were then compared with models of magnetic\u000d      flux ropes created at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics [3],\u000d      with the finding that these models provided support for the observational\u000d      work.\u000d    From 2009, Sergei Zharkov (PDRA 2009-2012) and Sarah Matthews (Lecturer\u000d      1999-present) conducted research that built on these results by analysing\u000d      and modelling the Sun's seismic activity. Over the last decade, it has\u000d      become well established that beams of particles accelerated during a solar\u000d      flare can travel into the Sun, delivering a significant momentum pulse\u000d      from the solar atmosphere into the solar interior and producing a\u000d      sunquake. The MSSL work led to the discovery that sunquakes can also be\u000d      triggered during the eruption of flux ropes [4]; the research showed that\u000d      as a magnetic flux rope accelerates away from the Sun, the rapidly\u000d      changing magnetic field anchored in the solar surface may deliver the\u000d      required momentum pulse. These results highlight the possibility of a\u000d      different, but important, role of the magnetic field not previously\u000d      considered in the triggering of sunquakes, which provides an excellent\u000d      opportunity to probe the physical processes involved in this transport of\u000d      momentum.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34175","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    UCL research into dark matter and dark energy has led to significant\u000a      stimulation of public interest\u000a      in these topics, achieved through a large number of public talks, online\u000a      blogs, articles in the media,\u000a      a BBC television programme and a public competition. It has also impacted\u000a      upon two artists,\u000a      influencing their creative practice and inspiring a number of their\u000a      publicly exhibited artworks.\u000a    Public events: UCL cosmologists regularly deliver public talks\u000a      based on their research. For\u000a      example, dark energy work at UCL was the subject of talks by Ofer Lahav at\u000a      the Royal Institution in\u000a      June 2013 (attended by 300 people) and at Tate Britain (in March 2009),\u000a      and a talk by Sarah Bridle\u000a      at the British Astronomical Association (in 2008). Lahav also delivered a\u000a      public UCL Lunch Hour\u000a      Lecture (in November 2010), \"Light and Darkness in the Accelerating\u000a      Universe\", which was\u000a      subsequently uploaded to YouTube and had received almost 2,000 views as of\u000a      31 July 2013 [A].\u000a      Hiranya Peiris delivered a Space talk at Royal Greenwich Observatory in\u000a      March 2013 and a talk at\u000a      the British Interplanetary Society in July 2012, both of which were on her\u000a      Planck research; a UCL\u000a      Science Centre lecture to several hundred sixth formers and teachers in\u000a      March 2012; and a talk to\u000a      MPs and policymakers at the RCUK event \"Impacts: people and skills\" in\u000a      2010.\u000a    Peiris was also invited to present results from the Planck mission on the\u000a      origin of the universe at\u000a      CERN's first TEDx event, TEDxCERN, in May 2013. The event had a live\u000a      audience of 600, as well\u000a      as viewing parties at 27 international participating institutions that\u000a      were attended by a total of 1,000\u000a      people, and 10,870 unique viewers who tuned into the webcast. Peiris's\u000a      talk was subsequently\u000a      posted on YouTube and had been viewed over 2,000 times as of 31 July 2013\u000a      [B].\u000a    Blogs: UCL cosmology research is regularly discussed in two blogs\u000a      set up by members of staff:\u000a      MSSL ASTRO, which was initiated by Tom Kitching in March 2013 on behalf of\u000a      MSSL's\u000a      Astrophysics Group; and Early Universe @UCL, which was set up by Peiris in\u000a      May 2013 to\u000a      highlight the Planck research. As of 31 July 2013, these blogs had\u000a      received respectively around\u000a      2,000 views from 21 countries, and over 3,000 unique viewers with over\u000a      10,000 page hits.\u000a    Media coverage: Cosmology discoveries at UCL are regularly\u000a      reported in press releases that\u000a      attract a significant amount of attention from the media. For example, to\u000a      accompany the first\u000a      release of data from Planck, ESA published two press releases in March\u000a      2013 that featured work\u000a      contributed by UCL researchers on the physics of the early universe,\u000a      large-scale anomalies, and\u000a      the weak gravitational lensing of the CMB. This work then received\u000a      international press coverage in\u000a      March 2013, with articles in the New York Times (NYT), the Financial\u000a      Times, The Guardian, The\u000a      Economist, and on the BBC's website. These articles stimulated much public\u000a      interest and\u000a      discussion about Planck and the CMB, as evidenced by the many comments\u000a      posted online; for\u000a      example, 451 and 345 comments followed the BBC [C] and NYT [D] articles\u000a      respectively.\u000a    In February 2012, The Economist included both a feature article about\u000a      UCL's DES work and an\u000a      online video interview with Lahav about the research, which proved to be\u000a      one of the most popular\u000a      articles published that year. The interview sparked considerable in-depth\u000a      discussion about dark\u000a      energy by viewers, as evidenced by the detailed online comments [E]. The\u000a      article also stimulated a\u000a      significant amount of public interest in the topic, as described by the\u000a      newspaper's Online Science\u000a      Editor, who commented in August 2013: \"The nature of dark energy remains\u000a      one of the most\u000a      perplexing mysteries in all of physics. Despite being abstruse and\u000a      baffling, however, the topic\u000a      sparks great public interest. Our three-page article about dark energy\u000a      (which appeared both in our\u000a      print edition and online [...]), focusing on the ambitious Dark Energy\u000a      Survey and its quest to\u000a      understand the phenomenon, has been read a whopping 115,000 times since it\u000a      first appeared in\u000a      February 2012. That places it among the most popular pieces The Economist\u000a      published in the\u000a      whole of 2012, not just in its science section. It also secured 1,200\u000a      Facebook \"likes\" and was\u000a      tweeted more than 400 times. An accompanying video interview with\u000a      Professor Ofer Lahav has so\u000a      far been viewed nearly 12,000 times. Astronomy, it seems, has not lost its\u000a      ability to amaze and\u000a      inspire.\" [F]\u000a    Television and radio: An episode of Dara &#211; Briain's Science Club\u000a      featured UCL researcher Filipe\u000a      Abdalla talking about the LOFAR array and the challenges of pulling\u000a      hard-to-detect cosmological\u000a      information out of the data. The episode aired on BBC Two on 1 August\u000a      2013, with an audience of\u000a      1.22 million [G]. DES research at UCL was discussed on the BBC Radio 4\u000a      Today programme by\u000a      Bridle, Lahav and Peter Doel in October 2011.\u000a    Public competition: In October 2012, UCL's Tom Kitching launched a\u000a      public online competition\u000a      through the company Kaggle, with the brief to develop algorithms to\u000a      improve the mapping of dark\u000a      matter using gravitational lensing. The competition was underpinned by\u000a      UCL's research on weak\u000a      lensing for the Euclid space mission. It ran for two months and attracted\u000a      the attention of London-\u000a      based Winton Capital Management, which contributed $20,000 of prize funds.\u000a      The interesting\u000a      problem posed by the challenge attracted 3,553 online entries from 353\u000a      teams of participants, and\u000a      stimulated much discussion among entrants on the competition's forum about\u000a      their solutions and\u000a      dark matter [H]. The competition also received significant press\u000a      attention, including articles in Time\u000a      and Wired magazines, and was discussed in many blogs, including those\u000a      written by the\u000a      competition's winner and runner-up [I, J]. These participants' detailed\u000a      posts about the competition\u000a      and their solutions show that taking part increased their interest in and\u000a      understanding of the topic.\u000a    Winton benefited from its involvement in the competition, using it to\u000a      advertise its brand to the exact\u000a      demographic in which it was interested in finding future employees; for\u000a      example, it led to the\u000a      company recruiting a new Senior Data Scientist in 2013. Winton's\u000a      Recruitment Manager said:\u000a      \"Kaggle was a hugely successful venture for Winton. We expend huge amounts\u000a      of money and time\u000a      on identifying and trying to hire exceptional research scientists for our\u000a      business. We only manage\u000a      to hire 10-15 per year, though we interview several a week, and through\u000a      the Kaggle competition we\u000a      sourced two outstanding researchers, one a professor of statistics from\u000a      Portugal, the other a\u000a      postdoc physicist from California with a PhD from Harvard. The competition\u000a      was great branding\u000a      and even better it allowed us to help generate new physics research!\" [K]\u000a      The collaboration\u000a      between UCL, Kaggle and Winton is continuing, with a new competition using\u000a      Sloan Digital Sky\u000a      Survey imaged galaxies soon to be launched.\u000a    Creative practice of artists: UCL research has influenced the\u000a      creative practice of two artists, both\u000a      of whom spent time in the Department of Physics and Astronomy as\u000a      Artists-in-Residence and have\u000a      created new art inspired by cosmology research carried out at UCL.\u000a    The first Artist-in-Residence worked within the department from 2010 to\u000a      2011. UCL research on\u000a      dark matter, dark energy and DES inspired her to create a new body of\u000a      artworks: 100 Billion Suns,\u000a      As the World Turns, and History of Darkness. These works have been\u000a      exhibited all over the world,\u000a      in seven solo exhibitions and 21 group shows, including at Selfridges in\u000a      London, the Museum of\u000a      Contemporary Art in Sydney, Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, the Modern Art\u000a      Museum of Fort Worth,\u000a      The Art Institute of Chicago, Kunsthalle Wien, and Ingleby Gallery in\u000a      Edinburgh. In total, the\u000a      artworks have been viewed by over 1 million people. They also generated\u000a      significant press\u000a      coverage for the artist, including articles in Wired magazine, The Sunday\u000a      Times Culture, Art\u000a      Monthly, Observer New Review, AnOther Magazine, The Guardian and The\u000a      Independent. She\u000a      commented of her experience: \"My time spent as Artist-in-Residence in the\u000a      Department of Physics\u000a      and Astronomy has been invaluable to my research and artistic output.\u000a      [...] The ideas I\u000a      experienced in the department have inspired several more new works and\u000a      will continue to do so for\u000a      years to come.\" [L]\u000a    This artist has appeared in two films talking to Lahav about cosmology\u000a      research at UCL. \"All the\u000a      Dead Stars\" was made by Tate Britain in 2009 and \"When Art Meets\u000a      Astronomy\" was made by\u000a      UCL in 2011; as of 31 July 2013, these films had been viewed on YouTube by\u000a      around 8,000\u000a      people [M] and around 6,000 people [N] respectively. Lahav also delivered\u000a      talks at Tate Britain (in\u000a      2009) and the Whitstable Biennale (in 2010) on the connection between the\u000a      department's research\u000a      and the artist's work; these two talks were attended by a total of around\u000a      100 members of the\u000a      public.\u000a    The second artist began her residency in 2011 and completed an artwork in\u000a      February 2013 called\u000a      \"untitled &#8212; the dark energy survey\". This artwork was directly inspired by\u000a      the DES optical corrector\u000a      constructed at UCL and took almost two years to produce. It is now on\u000a      display at the University of\u000a      London Observatory at Mill Hill, where it will be viewed by hundreds of\u000a      visitors every year.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Cosmologists at UCL &#8212; based in the Department of Physics and Astronomy\u000a      and the Mullard Space\u000a      Science Laboratory (MSSL) &#8212; conduct research into dark matter and dark\u000a      energy through their\u000a      involvement in a number of space missions and ground-based projects.

Another mystery is\u000a      the nature of cold dark matter, a type of matter that is thought to\u000a      account for a large part of the total\u000a      mass of the universe, and the existence of which is inferred from the\u000a      gravitational attraction of\u000a      galaxies and stars. Cosmologists at UCL have been investigating these and\u000a      other problems since\u000a      2004, when cosmology was established as a research area within the\u000a      university. These\u000a      researchers have played leadership roles in the following cutting-edge\u000a      cosmology projects:\u000a    (i) The Dark Energy Survey (DES) has been UCL cosmology's\u000a      `flagship project'. The $40 million\u000a      international DES is using a new wide-field camera, constructed in part at\u000a      UCL, on the 4-metre\u000a      Blanco telescope in Chile. The survey started in September 2013 and will\u000a      map 300 million galaxies\u000a      over five years. Its aim is to determine the nature of dark energy and\u000a      what is causing the universe's\u000a      acceleration. Contributions to the research by the UCL team since 2005\u000a      included building the\u000a      optical corrector for the DES camera [1] and developing novel methods to\u000a      derive galaxy distances\u000a      from their colours by utilising artificial neural networks. UCL\u000a      researchers also conducted studies of\u000a      the feasibility of DES to characterise dark energy and dark matter &#8212; for\u000a      example, that DES\u000a      (combined with Planck) might measure neutrino mass for the first time [2].\u000a    (ii) Euclid is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission that is\u000a      expected to launch in 2020. It will\u000a      carry out spectroscopic measurements of tens of millions of galaxies with\u000a      the aim of understanding\u000a      the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Since 2006, UCL has been\u000a      involved in the inception\u000a      and creation of all aspects of the weak lensing science for Euclid. UCL\u000a      has contributed and led\u000a      scientifically on the development of weak lensing and photometric redshift\u000a      methodology, on the\u000a      creation of novel approaches for the mitigation and assessment of\u000a      systematic effects [3], and in the\u000a      survey design.\u000a    (iii) Planck - ESA's first mission to study the origins of the\u000a      universe &#8212; surveyed the sky from 2009\u000a      to 2013. Contributions to Planck by UCL researchers [4, 5] included (a)\u000a      the selection, calibration\u000a      and testing of all the cold optical components of the High Frequency\u000a      Instrument on board the\u000a      Planck satellite; (b) development of innovative algorithms to constrain\u000a      fundamental theories for the\u000a      origin of structure in the universe; (c) methods to measure the global\u000a      geometry and isotropy of the\u000a      universe; and (d) methodology for the reconstruction of the mass\u000a      distribution of the universe as\u000a      traced by lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Cosmological\u000a      research findings\u000a      that are related to these UCL contributions include (a) the first\u000a      detection by a single experiment of\u000a      the deviation from scale-invariance of the primordial power spectrum, as\u000a      predicted by the\u000a      fundamental theory of the origin of cosmic structure called \"inflation\";\u000a      and (b) the first full sky map\u000a      of where all the mass is in our universe.\u000a    (iv) The LOFAR array is the most sensitive radio telescope\u000a      ever built in the low frequencies. A\u000a      major goal of this telescope is to detect directly the Epoch of\u000a      Reionisation, which is the time in the\u000a      history of our universe when the first objects were born. The signal that\u000a      arrives at the telescope\u000a      from the Epoch of Reionisation is 10,000 times smaller than the\u000a      contamination from our galaxy.\u000a      UCL researchers have played a major role [6] since 2010 in building the\u000a      techniques that separate\u000a      these signals from each other and from the signal from extragalactic\u000a      objects; they implemented an\u000a      algorithm that performs foreground subtraction and introduced it in\u000a      pipeline form so that other\u000a      members of the collaboration could use it.\u000a    Key UCL researchers: Ofer Lahav (Perren Chair of Astronomy\u000a      2004-present), Sarah Bridle\u000a      (Reader in Astronomy 2004-2012), Jochen Weller (Lecturer 2005-2009),\u000a      Filipe Abdalla (Lecturer in\u000a      Astronomy 2005-present), Hiranya Peiris (Reader in Astronomy\u000a      2009-present), Tom Kitching\u000a      (Lecturer 2012-present), Mark Cropper (Professor of Astrophysics\u000a      1988-present), Peter Doel\u000a      (Reader in Astronomy 1998-present) and Giorgio Savini (Lecturer\u000a      2009-present).\u000a    While aspects of the impact clearly focus on UCL contributions, all four\u000a      projects are international\u000a      projects. They also involve other UK institutions, which share in the\u000a      credit for the impact generated.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34176","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Knowledge transfer between UCL and industry has enabled technological\u000a      developments in the\u000a      microelectronics industry, including the employment of HfO2 in\u000a      new products. This has been\u000a      facilitated by UCL contracts with SEMATECH (SMT), a non-profit,\u000a      world-leading technology\u000a      research and development consortium, which includes several of the world's\u000a      biggest microchip\u000a      manufacturers &#8212; IBM, Intel, TSMC, Samsung and GlobalFoundries &#8212; as full\u000a      members, and over 40\u000a      other semiconductors-related companies as associated members. The\u000a      consortium works to\u000a      accelerate the development of the advanced manufacturing technologies that\u000a      will be needed to\u000a      build more powerful semiconductor devices. Contracts with research\u000a      consortiums such as SMT are\u000a      vital for university research groups to be able to contribute to the\u000a      development of new technology\u000a      and secure impact in the microelectronics industry.\u000a    Research findings from the Shluger group at UCL, along with those from\u000a      many other research\u000a      groups, are collated by SMT and presented by them to their member\u000a      companies on a regular basis\u000a      via confidential reports. Member companies then make use of these\u000a      findings, together with their\u000a      own in-house research, to enable technological developments and new\u000a      devices such as improved\u000a      transistors. Due to the highly confidential nature of this industry it is\u000a      impossible to deduce which\u000a      particular research findings are implemented by the member companies in\u000a      their improved devices;\u000a      however, the fact that UCL research has been continuously financially\u000a      supported by the industry\u000a      (via its research consortium) since 2004 constitutes an unambiguous proof\u000a      of its practical\u000a      significance. The UCL results and analysis - and process modifications\u000a      based on these results &#8212; contained\u000a      in SMT's confidential reports have also been consistently highly evaluated\u000a      by the\u000a      member companies [A]. Industry's high valuation of the research presented\u000a      to it by SMT, including\u000a      that from UCL, also ensures that the consortium is able to keep operating\u000a      [A].\u000a    Since 2004, the Shluger group has been actively involved in three major\u000a      programmes at SMT. For\u000a      each of these programmes, the UCL research described in section 2 has\u000a      helped SMT to meet their\u000a      obligations to their member companies by providing them with important\u000a      insights, which they were\u000a      able to pass on. The particular impacts described below all took place\u000a      after 1 January 2008 [B].\u000a    One programme was the development of the next generation of gate\u000a      dielectrics, the so-called\u000a      higher-k dielectrics, intended for transistor devices with an effective\u000a      oxide thickness (EOT) of less\u000a      than 0.5nm (required by the International Technology Roadmap for\u000a      Semiconductors). Scaling the\u000a      transistor size helps to increase their packing density and improve\u000a      performance and power\u000a      consumption of microchips. The UCL group provided an understanding of the\u000a      material properties\u000a      responsible for the HfO2 dielectric constant, which enabled SMT\u000a      to fabricate and demonstrate\u000a      transistors with an EOT of 0.49nm [B]. The understanding of the origin and\u000a      structure of defects in\u000a      HfO2 and at Si\/HfO2 interfaces developed by the\u000a      Shluger group also provided the way to minimise\u000a      the negative impact of these defects by modifying processing conditions;\u000a      SMT confirmed that the\u000a      proposal made in the UCL work to apply the post-deposition anneal using\u000a      ammonia improved\u000a      device transconductance and reduced device threshold voltage instability.\u000a      Additionally, the UCL\u000a      group's determination of the size of the electron traps enabled the\u000a      thickness of the HfO2 layer to be\u000a      scaled down to below 2.5nm, drastically reducing the instability [A].\u000a    Another programme involved the development of advanced non-volatile\u000a      memory, based on a well-controlled\u000a      and highly repeatable change of the dielectric resistivity rather than on\u000a      a conventional\u000a      electron storage technology. SMT reported that: \"Calculations of the\u000a      sub-stoichiometric poly-crystalline\u000a      dielectric structures performed by Prof. Shluger's group allowed to\u000a      pinpoint that the\u000a      grain boundaries are the critical morphological material properties which\u000a      define the resistive\u000a      switching paths. Furthermore, Prof. Shluger's study identified atomic\u000a      characteristics of the oxygen\u000a      vacancies at the grain boundaries and their kinetic, which played a\u000a      critical role in resistive\u000a      switching process. Based on these findings, SMT was able to optimize the\u000a      material properties and\u000a      fabricate high performance memory devices meeting the project objectives\"\u000a      [B]. They added that\u000a      \"the UCL contribution is highly valuable\" for this programme [B].\u000a    The third programme involved the mechanisms of dielectric degradation,\u000a      which, to a great degree,\u000a      determines overall device reliability. The UCL group's research provided\u000a      an atomic-level\u000a      description of the defect generation process in the SiO2\u000a      dielectric when subjected to electrical\u000a      stress. This research finding was employed by SMT to develop a model\u000a      capable of estimating the\u000a      device lifetime, which received high evaluation by member companies [B].\u000a    All of the important insights above were communicated by SMT to their\u000a      member companies and,\u000a      together with contributions from many other research groups, have enabled\u000a      technological\u000a      developments in the microelectronics industry, including the employment of\u000a      HfO2 in new products.\u000a    For example, in 2009, Intel released a new 32nm microchip [C] that uses\u000a      the hafnium-based\u000a      dielectric [A]. This was an improvement on its 45nm microchip released in\u000a      2007, which was the first\u000a      technology node to use the new high-k dielectric material. To enable\u000a      production of the 32nm\u000a      technology, modifications were mostly made to the device architecture and\u000a      sizes, improvements\u000a      that were underpinned by research including that conducted by the Shluger\u000a      group. For example,\u000a      the EOT of the high-k dielectric was reduced from 1.0nm in the 45nm\u000a      technology to 0.9nm in the\u000a      32nm technology [C]. Further technological improvements enabled Intel to\u000a      release in 2011 the\u000a      even smaller 22nm transistor technology [D], which also uses the\u000a      hafnium-based dielectric [A].\u000a      Other companies &#8212; IBM, TSMC, Samsung and GlobalFoundries &#8212; now also make\u000a      use of the\u000a      hafnium-based dielectric in their microchip technologies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Researchers within the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCL have\u000a      investigated the\u000a      properties of defects in bulk HfO2 and at Si\/SiOx\/HfO2\u000a      interfaces.

However, as\u000a      transistors shrink, leakage current increases, limiting computer processor\u000a      performance and\u000a      increasing energy consumption. Managing that leakage current is crucial\u000a      for reliable high-speed\u000a      operation, and is becoming an increasingly important factor in chip design\u000a      and the reduction of\u000a      power consumption. The semiconductor industry is also struggling with the\u000a      heat of chips, which\u000a      increases exponentially as the number of transistors on a chip increases.\u000a      Controlling leakage\u000a      current by using new high dielectric constant (high-k) materials instead\u000a      of SiO2 is one of many\u000a      steps towards making sure that scaling of devices continues and ever\u000a      smaller transistors run\u000a      reliably.\u000a    High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium dioxide (HfO2) and hafnium\u000a      silicates, have been in the spotlight\u000a      of both scientists and engineers over the last ten years as substitutes\u000a      for SiO2 as the gate dielectric\u000a      in metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). However,\u000a      defects and electron\u000a      trapping in the dielectric layer of these devices lead to the degradation\u000a      of their performance and\u000a      reliability, hampering implementation of these dielectrics in a\u000a      manufacturing environment.\u000a    UCL research in this area focused on modelling defects and their\u000a      properties in bulk HfO2 and at\u000a      Si\/SiOx\/HfO2 interfaces. The research during\u000a      2001-2007 involved using a wide range of\u000a      computational methods for modelling defects in insulators [1-3]. The\u000a      research carried out in 2008-2011\u000a      was concerned with the interaction of these defects with grain boundaries\u000a      in polycrystalline\u000a      HfO2 and their effects on the leakage current and breakdown of\u000a      devices [4, 5]. The embedded\u000a      cluster method developed at UCL allowed modelling of the electronic\u000a      structure and spectroscopic\u000a      properties of defects in high-k oxides with the high accuracy required for\u000a      predicting their properties.\u000a      UCL researchers were able to identify specific defects in polycrystalline\u000a      oxide films and at\u000a      interfaces by comparing their predicted optical, electron trapping and EPR\u000a      (electron paramagnetic\u000a      resonance) spectroscopy properties, and the predicted positions of their\u000a      electronic energy levels,\u000a      with experimental data.\u000a    Findings of the research included the determination that oxygen vacancies\u000a      in these oxides can\u000a      capture up to five electrons. It was also found that these defects can be\u000a      effectively passivated by\u000a      H2N groups, suggesting that an application of an ammonia\u000a      post-deposition anneal would be more\u000a      effective than the conventional N2 ambient [2]. This helped to\u000a      resolve the concern that extremely\u000a      high defect density in this material made it unsuitable for high-volume\u000a      production. In addition, the\u000a      size of the electron traps (the electron localisation area) was found to\u000a      be in the order of 1nm (the\u000a      electron was found to be spread over three nearby Hf atoms) [1, 3]. UCL\u000a      researchers also\u000a      determined characteristics of the oxygen vacancies at the grain boundaries\u000a      in monoclinic HfO2 and\u000a      their diffusion paths [4, 5].\u000a    Key UCL researchers: A.

It employs\u000d\u000a      1,600 people, roughly a third of whom are scientists and engineers, and\u000d\u000a      has annual sales of around $370 million. The MSSL research has underpinned\u000d\u000a      improved performance of e2v within the REF impact period; it has enabled\u000d\u000a      the company to win major contracts, led to improvements in its CCD\u000d\u000a      technology, and enhanced its standing in the space market. e2v's Chief\u000d\u000a      Engineer (Imaging Applications) confirmed the importance of UCL's work to\u000d\u000a      the company: \"the e2v relationship with MSSL and UCL has been one of the\u000d\u000a      foundations of our space science imaging business\" [A].\u000d\u000a    The development of new generations of CCDs is an expensive affair,\u000d\u000a      costing millions of pounds, yet cannot be left to chance once a future\u000d\u000a      space programme is selected. e2v tends to undertake new device\u000d\u000a      developments under contract from customer organisations (rather than fund\u000d\u000a      such developments fully themselves). Prior to selection it is necessary to\u000d\u000a      first demonstrate the science performance and reliability of devices.\u000d\u000a      MSSL's engagement with e2v and assistance in areas such as this &#8212; in\u000d\u000a      addition to their joint research with e2v on prior space missions &#8212; has\u000d\u000a      enabled the company to secure two major contracts with ESA that have been\u000d\u000a      active within the REF impact period: a &#8364;20 million contract (2007 to 2011)\u000d\u000a      for the supply of CCDs for the Gaia mission, due to be launched in late\u000d\u000a      2013; and a &#8364;10 million contract (2012 to 2016) for the supply of CCDs for\u000d\u000a      the visible (VIS) instrument on the Euclid mission, due to be launched in\u000d\u000a      2020 [A]. Gaia and Euclid will include the largest and second largest CCD\u000d\u000a      focal planes ever built for space, with 109 and 36 CCDs respectively. The\u000d\u000a      success of both missions is critically dependent on the performance of the\u000d\u000a      CCDs, since their main data product is the output of these devices.\u000d\u000a      Interpretation of the CCD signals therefore delivers the primary mission\u000d\u000a      objectives.\u000d\u000a    MSSL's engagement and work with e2v has also enhanced the company's\u000d\u000a      standing in the competitive space market, and has assisted them in\u000d\u000a      becoming Europe's dominant and preferred supplier of CCDs for space\u000d\u000a      science applications [B]. Indeed, the track record that the research has\u000d\u000a      helped e2v to secure is unrivalled. This enhanced reputation and improved\u000d\u000a      ability to secure contracts was recognised by the company's Chief\u000d\u000a      Engineer, who, speaking about the impact of the joint Gaia mission\u000d\u000a      research on the Euclid contract and other business activities, said: \"The\u000d\u000a      supply of custom CCDs to the Gaia mission is still the largest space\u000d\u000a      contract that we have won [...] and the support of MSSL in making this\u000d\u000a      mission feasible is of course significant. The capability that this\u000d\u000a      experience has built at e2v now makes it possible for us to be a credible\u000d\u000a      supplier to the next ESA science missions. For example, we have recently\u000d\u000a      won a contract for &#8364;10M for supply of CCDs to the Euclid VIS instrument\u000d\u000a      [text removed for publication]\" [A].\u000d\u000a    The influence of MSSL research on the success of e2v is further\u000d\u000a      emphasised by the Chief Engineer, who praises \"the strong technical\u000d\u000a      liaison between yourselves and the Lockheed Martin Solar Physics group,\u000d\u000a      which enabled us to supply CCDs into several programmes from SXI on GOES,\u000d\u000a      to all of the Hinode instruments, the HMI and AIA instruments on the Solar\u000d\u000a      Dynamics Observatory, and has built both our experience and reputation for\u000d\u000a      Solar Imaging such that we have also been able to address other\u000d\u000a      opportunities such as IRIS (the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer),\u000d\u000a      STEREO, and SUVI [text removed for publication]\" [A]. This liaison\u000d\u000a      comprised collaborative CCD research and was manifest in part in a joint\u000d\u000a      publication (reference [3] in section 3).\u000d\u000a    In addition to enhancing e2v's reputation and helping them to secure\u000d\u000a      large contracts, the symbiotic relationship between the company and MSSL\u000d\u000a      has led to an improved understanding at e2v of mission science\u000d\u000a      requirements and their implications for CCD design. The Chief Engineer\u000d\u000a      said: \"the insights that the MSSL team have brought to us on the mission\u000d\u000a      science requirements and how these translate into CCD performance needs\u000d\u000a      have enabled us to better understand how we can design and optimise our\u000d\u000a      detectors for particular applications. This insight has been invaluable in\u000d\u000a      allowing us to address other customers with similar requirements, being\u000d\u000a      able to offer solutions rather than simply asking questions. In this high\u000d\u000a      technology marketplace this is a very strong selling point.\" [A]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted within the Department of Space and Climate Physics at\u000d\u000a      UCL has had a significant impact upon e2v Ltd., a manufacturer of\u000d\u000a      charge-coupled devices (CCDs).

CCDs are optical sensors that take the form of a\u000d\u000a      two-dimensional pixelated array. They have revolutionised the acquisition\u000d\u000a      of image information; for example, modern digital cameras are based on\u000d\u000a      devices of this kind. The success of scientific applications is often\u000d\u000a      critically dependent on the precise response of CCDs in their expected\u000d\u000a      environment; for space science applications, this environment is a\u000d\u000a      satellite operating in the harsh conditions of space.\u000d\u000a    Since 1995, the MSSL group has worked closely with CCD manufacturer e2v\u000d\u000a      Ltd. on a programme of CCD characterisation and modelling [1-6]. This\u000d\u000a      partnership typically involves the detailed design and manufacture of CCDs\u000d\u000a      by e2v, followed by the scientific evaluation and characterisation of the\u000d\u000a      devices in specialist facilities at MSSL. This characterisation is within\u000d\u000a      the context of performance and process models, and includes aspects such\u000d\u000a      as noise sources and electron mobility, diffusion and loss. Test data are\u000d\u000a      simulated and interpreted to quantify underlying device properties, and\u000d\u000a      device performance is estimated. The models that are used have been either\u000d\u000a      developed at MSSL or adapted from those in the published literature. The\u000d\u000a      results and evaluations from the research at MSSL then go on to inform\u000d\u000a      e2v's next generation of devices and their optimal use. The programme has\u000d\u000a      so far involved the characterisation of more than 250 of e2v's CCDs.\u000d\u000a    The collaborative studies function within a virtuous circle, in which\u000d\u000a      research insights relating to the improvement of CCDs are shared, and\u000d\u000a      understanding builds from project to project. Insights that have resulted\u000d\u000a      from the programme of research are in areas including the physical\u000d\u000a      processes of the devices, such as electron mobility and diffusion, noise\u000d\u000a      sources, linearity, electron loss mechanisms, sensitivity, temperature\u000d\u000a      dependence and set voltage dependence; camera design optimisation; device\u000d\u000a      specification; and CCD data interpretation (calibration) during data\u000d\u000a      analysis. For example, the MSSL group showed how linearity of response\u000d\u000a      could be increased beyond full-well capacity through pixel integration,\u000d\u000a      and the point spread function dependency on wavelength gave insight into\u000d\u000a      the electron diffusion in the drift region of the CCDs.\u000d\u000a    Much of this CCD research was conducted as part of studies of future\u000d\u000a      space mission concepts, of which there are many more than actual space\u000d\u000a      missions, due to the way that technical risk is mitigated and selections\u000d\u000a      are made. Such studies are very comprehensive and are often competitive\u000d\u000a      against other mission concepts. These collaborative CCD studies were\u000d\u000a      conducted between 1996 and 2002 for the space mission Integral, which was\u000d\u000a      launched in 2002 [1, 2]; in 1999 and 2000 for the GOES Solar X-ray Imager\u000d\u000a      (SXI) [3]; in the early 2000s for the planned space mission Eddington [4,\u000d\u000a      5]; in the mid 2000s for the FPP (Focal Plane Package) and EIS\u000d\u000a      (Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer) [6] instruments on the space\u000d\u000a      mission Hinode, which was launched in 2006; from the late 2000s to the\u000d\u000a      present time for the current space missions Gaia and Euclid; and for a\u000d\u000a      number of other space missions. Often a customer that was an expert in\u000d\u000a      detector technology was also involved, working with MSSL to optimise\u000d\u000a      mission performance (for example, Lockheed Martin for GOES SXI [3] and\u000d\u000a      Hinode FPP; and ESA for Eddington [4, 5], Euclid and Gaia).\u000d\u000a    For actual flight missions the emphasis was on device specification,\u000d\u000a      device characterisation, identifying optimal operating conditions,\u000d\u000a      screening and preparation for exploitation.

The event was intended to facilitate interaction between the\u000d\u000a      high-energy physics, security and medical sectors. As a direct result of\u000d\u000a      this, a dialogue with Plessey Semiconductors began which culminated in an\u000d\u000a      exclusive manufacturing licence, signed in December 2010. By September\u000d\u000a      2011, the first integrated-circuit version of the sensor had been\u000d\u000a      successfully implemented by Plessey and was ready for designing into\u000d\u000a      products. A second sales licence was agreed with Plessey in June 2012. The\u000d\u000a      technology is now being marketed as the Electric Potential Integrated\u000d\u000a      Circuit (EPIC) sensor [see Section 5, C1].\u000d\u000a    The main impact of this sensor technology to date has been on Plessey\u000d\u000a      Semiconductors [C1]. Following a restructuring of the company, two new\u000d\u000a      technologies were acquired from UK universities, with the specific aim of\u000d\u000a      transforming the company from a foundry manufacturer of semiconductor\u000d\u000a      components to a product-oriented company focused around two major product\u000d\u000a      lines. EP sensor technology from Sussex is one of these two and has had a\u000d\u000a      significant impact on both the shape and the direction of the company.\u000d\u000a      Plessey has made a major investment and commitment to EP sensors. The\u000d\u000a      current levels of investment within Plessey stand at &#163;x, with x employees\u000d\u000a      dedicated full-time to the technology, in applications support, sales and\u000d\u000a      marketing, and development through funded collaborative programmes.\u000d\u000a      Revenue to the University of Sussex from the licences is a mixture of\u000d\u000a      licence fees (&#163;x for 11\/12), patent costs and royalty payments, which\u000d\u000a      started in 2013. Royalties are based on sales of &#163;x for 2012 and projected\u000d\u000a      sales of &#163;x for 2013 and &#163;x for 2014.\u000d\u000a    In addition to this overt commercialisation of the technology, work has\u000d\u000a      been carried out in conjunction with the Research and Enterprise Division\u000d\u000a      and the Innovation Centre (SInC) at Sussex, with funding from the\u000d\u000a      Enterprise Panel (University of Sussex) and the South East Health\u000d\u000a      Technologies Alliance (SEHTA) to develop awareness of the technology in\u000d\u000a      the wider community. EP sensors have been judged to be disruptive in a\u000d\u000a      number of market sectors, by both a multi-national company [C10] and\u000d\u000a      independent consultants [C11]. There was therefore a perceived need to\u000d\u000a      engage with and educate the market and potential users about the\u000d\u000a      capabilities of this new disruptive technology. Necessarily, due to the\u000d\u000a      generic nature of the sensors, this involved a diverse range of\u000d\u000a      institutions and companies across a broad spectrum of market sectors. The\u000d\u000a      model used for this engagement process was to issue evaluation licences to\u000d\u000a      organisations for a 12-month period with a small fee to cover costs and\u000d\u000a      the requirement of a confidential written report at the termination of the\u000d\u000a      licence. The funding enabled a batch of pre-production prototypes to be\u000d\u000a      manufactured by a local SME (Interface2 Ltd, Newhaven) [C2], for\u000d\u000a      distribution under these evaluation licences to interested commercial\u000d\u000a      organisations (from multi-nationals to SMEs, both within the UK and\u000d\u000a      outside) and to potential partners (including universities, government\u000d\u000a      laboratories and organisations). To date the University has placed 20\u000d\u000a      evaluation licences and has direct involvement with collaborative projects\u000d\u000a      across all market sectors, including healthcare, sports, security[C4],\u000d\u000a      safety, aerospace [C3], automotive and geophysics [C6].\u000d\u000a    In partnership with a number of commercial organisations,\u000d\u000a      proof-of-concept designs were developed spanning electrophysiological\u000d\u000a      measurement, with Plessey funding 3 postdoctoral positions at Sussex;\u000d\u000a      Rescon Ltd, two DARPA contracts &#8212; &#163;150k; a multi-partner EU grant with\u000d\u000a      Philips Healthcare and Plessey (2012-16, &gt;&#163;20m); surface-charge density\u000d\u000a      imaging, including forensic fingerprinting, in collaboration with the Home\u000d\u000a      Office\/CAST [C4]; movement sensing, MOD funded, 2009-10, &#163;98k; aerospace\u000d\u000a      instrumentation, TSB-funded project `Novel Electric Field Sensors for\u000d\u000a      Advanced Aero-Engine Monitoring' with Meggitt Sensing Systems [C3] and\u000d\u000a      Plessey Semiconductors [C1], 2012-14, total &#163;1.1m, &#163;524k industry; and\u000d\u000a      geophysical and structural health monitoring with British Geological\u000d\u000a      Survey, Keyworth [C5].\u000d\u000a    The additional impact directly resulting from this engagement activity\u000d\u000a      is:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Interface2, a local SME, is now the main sub-contractor for a much\u000d\u000a        larger organisation, Plessey, with responsibility for building the EPIC\u000d\u000a        chip into a variety of products [C1] for them.\u000d\u000a      The evaluation licensees are in direct contact with Plessey either as\u000d\u000a        customers or as potential customers for Plessey products.\u000d\u000a      Market sectors identified by evaluation licences form the major market\u000d\u000a        sectors for Plessey (Automotive, Sports, Healthcare).\u000d\u000a      The pre-production prototype design was adopted directly by Plessey as\u000d\u000a        their first commercial demonstration unit and manufactured by\u000d\u000a        Interface2.\u000d\u000a      One postgraduate student was funded by and seconded to Plessey as a\u000d\u000a        postdoc. x Plessey employees work directly on EPIC-related projects and\u000d\u000a        products.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    EP sensor technology has received external recognition for both the research\u000d\u000a    contribution and the commercialisation activity, including awards at\u000d\u000a    international trade fairs and product reviews:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      EPSRC, Basic Technology Review Panel Report [C6] (2010)\u000d\u000a      RCUK, `Big Ideas for the Future' [C6] (2011)\u000d\u000a      IET Innovation Award 2011, `Measurement in Action' [C7]\u000d\u000a      Gold award at `Best of Sensors Expo 2011' [C8]\u000d\u000a      EDN `Hot 100 products' list [C9] (2011): `The most innovative and\u000d\u000a        significant products and technologies as selected by the editors',\u000d\u000a        250,000 website viewings per month\u000d\u000a      Finalist for Times Higher Innovation Award 2011\u000d\u000a      Shortlisted for Army Research Office award 2012\u000d\u000a      (2008) Nature Research Highlights 454(21): 920 (Impact Factor\u000d\u000a        36.101, estimated readership of 424,000) doi:10.1038\/454920b.\u000d\u000a      \u000aNew Scientist, 2812: 22, 14 May 2011, estimated readership of\u000d\u000a        905,726,\u000d\u000a        http:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg21028126.800-static-charge-provides-clue-to-age-of-\u000d\u000a          fingerprints.html\u000a\u000d\u000a      \u000aHomeland Security Newswire, 23 May 2011, 30,000 specialist\u000d\u000a        subscribers\u000d\u000a        http:\/\/www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com\/sensors-detect-crime-solving-clues-our-fingertips\u000a\u000d\u000a      \u000aThe Economist, 13 October 2012, Weekly circulation 1.5 million,\u000d\u000a        http:\/\/www.economist.com\/node\/21564614\u000a\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In summary, the original basic research has spawned multi-million-pound\u000d\u000a      investment in developing it into concrete engineering applications,\u000d\u000a      supported by strategic university elements, giving rise to sustained\u000d\u000a      impact on industrial sensor solutions that are now starting to generate\u000d\u000a      substantial world- wide revenue for a UK company.

The focus of this activity was to study, both\u000d\u000a      theoretically and experimentally, the behaviour of SQUID systems as simple\u000d\u000a      macroscopic quantum objects, akin to single atoms [see Section 3, R1].\u000d\u000a      Probing the energy-level structure and investing the conjugate flux and\u000d\u000a      charge behaviour in a non-invasive, adiabatic manner involved the use of\u000d\u000a      extremely sophisticated low-noise experimental techniques. Specialised\u000d\u000a      shielded rooms and ultra-low noise temperature electronics were\u000d\u000a      specifically developed for this project [R2]. As part of this programme of\u000d\u000a      instrumentation development, a cryogenic electrometer was developed with\u000d\u000a      extremely high input impedance and commensurately low input capacitance to\u000d\u000a      enable the charge on the quantum system to be measured accurately. From\u000d\u000a      the start it was apparent that this was a device with generic sensing\u000d\u000a      capability quite unlike anything that had existed before. Initial funding\u000d\u000a      for the sensor, as an independent research activity, was provided by two\u000d\u000a      EPSRC awards (GR\/H57516\/01, 1993-94, &#163;80k; GR\/K38021\/01, 1995-97, &#163;81k).\u000d\u000a      During this period the programme of fundamental physics research continued\u000d\u000a      in parallel with the development of the sensor. This separate funding\u000d\u000a      stream enabled research on the fundamentals of measurement at extreme\u000d\u000a      impedances to be undertaken and for the measurement capability to be\u000d\u000a      demonstrated in a range of different scenarios. The results of this work\u000d\u000a      were to show that the sensor could operate using very small displacement\u000d\u000a      currents (~10-15 A), through weak (&lt;10-15 F)\u000d\u000a      capacitive coupling over a broad range of frequencies from quasi-DC\u000d\u000a      upwards [R3]. Additionally, the results revealed that this sensor could be\u000d\u000a      used as the basis for a novel imaging microscope system [R4] which was not\u000d\u000a      restricted to working within the tunnelling distance of the surface of the\u000d\u000a      sample. Initial work on larger-scale electrode structures also yielded\u000d\u000a      interesting results when applied to electro-physiological measurements.\u000d\u000a      Conventionally these would use low impedance wet-gel electrodes. By\u000d\u000a      adapting the EP sensor to operate through a larger (&gt;10-12\u000d\u000a      F) coupling capacitance, it was possible to demonstrate low-noise\u000d\u000a      electrocardiogram signal acquisition without the need for gel or resistive\u000d\u000a      contact with the skin, so simplifying the procedure considerably [R5]. It\u000d\u000a      is intrinsically stable, electrically and mechanically robust, and\u000d\u000a      chemically and biochemically inert.\u000d\u000a    This work was followed by an RCUK Basic Technology award (GR\/R87550\/01,\u000d\u000a      2002-06, &#163;1.1m) where the sensors were configured to measure either\u000d\u000a      electric field, spatial potential or static charge, either through weak\u000d\u000a      capacitive coupling or in free space. During this period, extensive\u000d\u000a      research led to significant publications &#8212; including [R6], which won the\u000d\u000a      IOP Measurement Science and Technology `Best Paper Award' (2002) &#8212; and to\u000d\u000a      the first of a suite of seven patents filed. A number of these are now\u000d\u000a      granted worldwide (EP1451595, US7885700, JP4391823, TWI308066, EP2002273,\u000d\u000a      AU2007228660, US8264247, US8054061, CN101490564, EP2047284, US12\/278214,\u000d\u000a      JP2008552874), with the rest in process. In addition, there were 25 other\u000d\u000a      journal publications relating to EP sensors in this period. Continued\u000d\u000a      funding from the EPSRC (Translation grant EP\/E042864\/1, 2007-11, &#163;893k)\u000d\u000a      and industry (&#163;1m) has since enabled a broad range of projects to be\u000d\u000a      undertaken spanning a wide range of possible future application areas\u000d\u000a      which clearly demonstrate the disruptive potential of the technology.\u000d\u000a      These include electrophysiological sensing [R5,R6], movement detection and\u000d\u000a      tracking, human machine interfacing, NMR instrumentation, materials\u000d\u000a      characterisation [R3,R4], surface-charge imaging for forensic\u000d\u000a      fingerprinting, and stress monitoring for geophysical applications and\u000d\u000a      structural-health monitoring. At this stage it became clear that\u000d\u000a      applications could span all length scales, ranging from f06dm to metres,\u000d\u000a      with corresponding levels of spatial resolution, and sensors could also be\u000d\u000a      integrated into one- or two-dimensional imaging arrays.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35263","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research on OLEDs including device fabrication capabilities provided\u000d\u000a      the opportunity to make compact wearable light sources for skin cancer\u000d\u000a      treatment. In order to realise this vision (as mentioned briefly above) we\u000d\u000a      applied for and received a \"proof of concept\" grant from Scottish\u000d\u000a      Enterprise to make a demonstrator device whose initial evaluation was\u000d\u000a      conducted at Ninewells Hospital. Further support from Scottish Enterprise,\u000d\u000a      led to the fabrication of further devices in St Andrews, which were used\u000d\u000a      in a pilot trial demonstrating the potential of OLEDs for the photodynamic\u000d\u000a      therapy of skin cancer.\u000d\u000a    In order to enable the above research to be widely used, the prototype\u000d\u000a      devices made in the research outlined above needed to be developed into a\u000d\u000a      form suitable for regulatory approval and manufacture. The regulatory\u000d\u000a      approval of a medical device is a major task requiring extensive design\u000d\u000a      and testing to appropriate standards and so is both expensive and time\u000d\u000a      consuming. In order to address this, a spin-out company, Ambicare Health\u000d\u000a      Ltd was formed, and &#163;2M of venture capital raised a the start of 2008.\u000d\u000a    This funded the development of skin cancer and acne products following\u000d\u000a      the ISO13485 standards for medical devices and leading to CE marking of\u000d\u000a      both devices, thereby enabling them to be sold in all countries of the\u000d\u000a      European Union [S1]. In addition the skin cancer treatment has regulatory\u000d\u000a      approval in Australia, a major market for skin cancer treatment. A further\u000d\u000a      &#163;2M of venture capital has been raised since to support the manufacture\u000d\u000a      and marketing of these products. The product for skin cancer treatment is\u000d\u000a      called \"Ambulight\" and the acne treatment is called \"Lustre\" [F1]. The\u000d\u000a      official unveiling of the Ambulight product led to a wide range of press\u000d\u000a      and media interest and featured in many major UK and international\u000d\u000a      newspapers and on popular TV shows. [S2]\u000d\u000a    The research has led to health and economic benefits. The economic impact\u000d\u000a      to date is primarily in the form of licence, assignment and royalty fees\u000d\u000a      paid by Ambicare Health and totalling [text removed for publication]. By\u000d\u000a      simplifying treatment, and increasing the number of patients treated per\u000d\u000a      clinic (see below), there are also economic benefits to the treatment\u000d\u000a      provider (e.g. NHS) but we have not been able to quantify these.\u000d\u000a    The healthcare benefits of Ambulight are described in a letter by the\u000d\u000a      Joint Head of Photobiology at Ninewells Hospital [F2], who was not\u000d\u000a      involved in the development of the device, but has been performing\u000d\u000a      research on its effectiveness and is in charge of delivering Photodynamic\u000d\u000a      Therapy at the hospital. In the letter she explains that conventional PDT\u000d\u000a      is an effective treatment, but the light sources \"include expensive\u000d\u000a        lasers and relatively cumbersome static polychromatic, predominantly LED\u000d\u000a        sources\". She explains \"there are limitations with hospital-based\u000d\u000a        PDT and these include the fact that only a limited number of patients\u000d\u000a        can be treated in any one clinic session because of the availability of\u000d\u000a        specialised hospital-based light sources; the patient needs to wait for\u000d\u000a        a 3 hour period whilst the cream is in place and therefore this involves\u000d\u000a        at least a half-day visit to the hospital' the high intensity of the\u000d\u000a        light delivery using the hospital sources causes pain which in\u000d\u000a        approximately 16-20% is severe........ Pain has resulted in patients\u000d\u000a        discontinuing treatment prematurely and therefore not having effective\u000d\u000a        therapy .....It also limits the wider acceptance of\u000d\u000a        PDT....Hospital-based irradiation also requires that the patient must\u000d\u000a        lie still. Eye protection is needed for both the patient and staff..\"\u000d\u000a    The Ambulight device overcomes these limitations, providing a convenient\u000d\u000a      and comfortable treatment with advantages for both the patient and the\u000d\u000a      treatment provider. She explains \"The Ambulight device has\u000d\u000a        revolutionised many of the problems we have with conventional PDT. It is\u000d\u000a        a portable, wearable light source with battery pack. This means that it\u000d\u000a        is ideally suited for patients who are mobile and\/or keen to have\u000d\u000a        treatment at home. It also considerably reduces the amount of time that\u000d\u000a        the patient must attend the hospital and reduces the amount of input\u000d\u000a        from staff such that the through-put of the clinic can be greatly\u000d\u000a        increased.\" [F2]\u000d\u000a    She explains that Ambulight is effective and addresses the problem of\u000d\u000a      pain in conventional PDT. For example she comments on a recent study\u000d\u000a      conducted in which \"we have reported on 53 patients with 61 lesions\u000d\u000a        ...who were treated with Ambulight PDT and, again, pain scores were low,\u000d\u000a        but importantly efficacy at one year follow-up was high with 84% of\u000d\u000a        lesions being clear.\" [F2]\u000d\u000a    She adds \"Thus to summarise, Ambulight PDT is extremely convenient,\u000d\u000a        easy to use, associated with low levels of discomfort and is highly\u000d\u000a        effective for the treatment of these superficial non-melanoma skin\u000d\u000a        cancers and dysplasia. The use of these devices allows greater\u000d\u000a        through-put and efficiency of the PDT clinic and thus has major benefits\u000d\u000a        both for the patients, allowing them a comfortable, portable, effective\u000d\u000a        home-based treatment, but also for the running of the PDT clinic. The\u000d\u000a        treatment procedure is simplified and the number of patients that can be\u000d\u000a        treated in any given clinic session increased. With regard to the bigger\u000d\u000a        picture, Ambulight PDT certainly enhances the wider acceptance of PDT in\u000d\u000a        the community as pain had been a limiting factor for some referrers to\u000d\u000a        the service. Ambulight PDT now has a very important role in our own PDT\u000d\u000a        services and my understanding is that it has now been taken up in many\u000d\u000a        centres. Feedback indicated that 27 centres in the Netherlands are now\u000d\u000a        using Ambulight PDT, and uptake is ongoing in the UK. Thus, it has made\u000d\u000a        a significant impact in terms of change of practice in how we deliver\u000d\u000a        PDT.\" [F2]\u000d\u000a    The Principal Scientist at Ambicare Health has also written confirming\u000d\u000a      the above points about Ambulight Multi [F1]. He also explains the Lustre\u000d\u000a      product: \"Lustre is a wearable light source for acne treatment with\u000d\u000a        blue light. Acne has a major impact on the lives of many sufferers, and\u000d\u000a        in a clinical trial we have shown that Lustre offers major advantages in\u000d\u000a        reducing lesions. The advantage of Lustre is that it enables acne to be\u000d\u000a        treated in the comfort of the home, and without drugs or chemicals.\"\u000d\u000a    He adds \"Blue light therapy for the treatment of acne has been around\u000d\u000a        for many years, however existing treatment typically come in one of two\u000d\u000a        forms; torches that are held to the face by the user, or lamps that\u000d\u000a        shine remotely onto the skin. Both are highly inconvenient, particularly\u000d\u000a        in a home setting and consequently users are highly unmotivated to use\u000d\u000a        them. This leads to low treatment compliance and ultimately poor\u000d\u000a        efficacy. Lustre in contrast, is a light weight wearable device that\u000d\u000a        allows users to get on with their lives; this ease of use promotes\u000d\u000a        compliance and ultimately efficacy. This is very appealing to acne\u000d\u000a        sufferers and doctors treating them. At present Lustre is being sold\u000d\u000a        mainly in the Netherlands and the UK. It is in regular use in over 250\u000d\u000a        clinics in the UK.\" [F1]\u000d\u000a    He also comments \"In 2012 the Lustre Pure Light device won the\u000d\u000a        Aesthetic Industry Awards, Product innovation of the year.\" [F1]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Impact: Health and Economic Gains:\u000d\u000a    Research has led to a wearable light source that provides a new way of\u000d\u000a      treating many skin cancers and acne.

An important aspect of Prof Samuel's work since 2000 has\u000d\u000a      been organic semiconductor optoelectronics, including organic\u000d\u000a      light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). OLEDs are compact visible light sources\u000d\u000a      with the potential to be flexible. They consist of thin layers of organic\u000d\u000a      semiconductors in between suitable contacts. Research in the Organic\u000d\u000a      Semiconductor Centre covers many aspects of these devices &#8212; materials,\u000d\u000a      photophysics, device physics, optical design and applications. Materials\u000d\u000a      research focuses on solution-processed materials such as conjugated\u000d\u000a      dendrimers and polymers. Photophysics concerns the formation and nature of\u000d\u000a      the excited state responsible for light emission. Device physics includes\u000d\u000a      charge injection and transport, and optical design concerns light\u000d\u000a      out-coupling and ways of manipulating it. This research has led to\u000d\u000a      understanding of the factors controlling OLED efficiency and routes to\u000d\u000a      improve it, together with the capability to make efficient devices to a\u000d\u000a      high standard [R1, R2].\u000d\u000a    It is known that light, in combination with a photosensitiser can be used\u000d\u000a      to treat many cancers, a process called photodynamic therapy (PDT). In the\u000d\u000a      case of skin cancer, a cream is applied to the lesion to be treated, and\u000d\u000a      the cream is metabolised to the photosensitiser. The photosensitiser is\u000d\u000a      then illuminated by a powerful light source (often a laser) leading to the\u000d\u000a      tumour being destroyed. This procedure gives very good cosmetic outcome,\u000d\u000a      though requires spending a day at the hospital and can be painful. The\u000d\u000a      need for specialised equipment means that relatively few centres (7 in\u000d\u000a      Scotland) are able to offer this treatment. A discussion with Prof\u000d\u000a      Ferguson, Head of Photobiology at Ninewells Hospital led to the idea of\u000d\u000a      using a wearable (and disposable) light source instead of the current\u000d\u000a      bulky and expensive hospital-based light sources, and a patent on this\u000d\u000a      invention was filed late in 2001 [R3], and an alternative implementation\u000d\u000a      filed in 2006 [R4].\u000d\u000a    In subsequent research, a major part of which was supported by proof of\u000d\u000a      concept funding from Scottish Enterprise, wearable light sources suitable\u000d\u000a      for medical use were made in St Andrews and evaluated at Ninewells\u000d\u000a      hospital, The concept of an ambulatory light source for medical and\u000d\u000a      cosmetic purposes was implemented using both organic and inorganic\u000d\u000a      light-emitting diodes [R4]. The former gives a more compact light source\u000d\u000a      and more uniform illumination; the latter is easier to manufacture in a\u000d\u000a      conventional electronics factory. After initial clinical evaluation [R5],\u000d\u000a      the OLED device was successfully used in a pilot trial that showed\u000d\u000a      equivalent effectiveness and much-reduced pain in the treatment of skin\u000d\u000a      cancer [R6].\u000d\u000a    The above research was a major part of research recognised through the\u000d\u000a      award of the Beilby Medal and Prize to Prof Samuel. This medal is awarded\u000d\u000a      by the Institute of Materials, the Royal Society of Chemistry and the\u000d\u000a      Society for the Chemical Industry for materials research of exceptional\u000d\u000a      practical significance. International recognition of its practical\u000d\u000a      significance came through the Organic Semiconductor Centre winning the\u000d\u000a      Academic R&amp;D award at Printed Electronics USA, the world's largest\u000d\u000a      printed electronics meeting.\u000d\u000a    Personnel:\u000d\u000a    Key PHYESTA researchers involved were Professor Ifor Samuel\u000d\u000a      (2000-Present) with Dr Miguel Camacho Lopez (PDRA 2002-2003) and Andrew\u000d\u000a      McNeill (PDRA 2003-2007)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35264","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    PHYESTA is involved in a particularly vigorous programme of Public\u000a      Outreach, Engagement and Education. A major aspect of this is the ROE\u000a      Visitor Centre (www.roe.ac.uk\/vc).\u000a      Within the UK university sector, this programme is unusual in its breadth\u000a      and scope, extending well beyond the normal expectation of public talks,\u000a      press releases and media interviews. This is in part because university\u000a      staff, post-docs and students have the opportunity to work collaboratively\u000a      with Visitor Centre Staff, but is also due to the unique advantages\u000a      afforded by the ROE site, with its unusual combination of front-line\u000a      astronomical research, world-leading instrument\/technology development,\u000a      and astronomical history\/heritage.\u000a    Activities include the annual open days, weekly public observing,\u000a      `Meet The Astronomer' sessions, school visits, blogs, teacher training\u000a      (including the development of educational resources for Primary and\u000a      Secondary teachers) [F1], adult `continuing-education' certificated\u000a      evening courses, and the development and operation of the Dark Sky\u000a      Scotland and Dark Sky England programmes [F2]. ROE is now also the\u000a      Scottish centre for the European Space Agency led European Space Education\u000a      Resource Office (ESERO) [S1]. Over the last year, PHYESTA has also\u000a      collaborated with the Edinburgh College of Art to produce a film on\u000a      exoplanets (Wish You Were Here? Searching for Exoplanets), which\u000a      won an honourable mention in the `Scientific Merit Award' at the Imagine\u000a      Science Film Satellite Festival in Dublin, leading to it being shown in\u000a      the official Imagine Science Film Festival in New York in Nov 2012.\u000a    Impact on the General Public\u000a      Evidence of short-term Impact is provided by basic numbers, and\u000a      immediate feedback from questionnaires etc. For example, the annual\u000a      PHYESTA Open Days attract ~3000 visitors of all ages, while ~6000\u000a      school-age children either visit PHYESTA institutions, or receive school\u000a      visits each year. In addition, more than 50 community Dark Sky events have\u000a      now been held throughout Scotland, and more than 800 teachers and\u000a      educators have been trained to run Dark Sky activities. PHYESTA makes a\u000a      major contribution towards this direct people contact. For example, in\u000a      2010, ten post-graduate students contributed a combined total of over 300\u000a      hours to outreach activity.\u000a    The short-term impact of PHYESTA's exoplanet work can also be\u000a      demonstrated. PHYESTA's exhibit \"Is there anybody out there? Looking\u000a        for new worlds\" [S2] was a highlight of the 2008 Royal Society\u000a      Summer Science Exhibition, and was selected to be shown at Techfest 2009\u000a      at the IIT (Mumbai, India). The Royal Society exhibition attracted 3069\u000a      visitors (including 894 students and 109 teachers), as well as 1197\u000a      invited VIP guests in two evening sessions [S3]. Exhibitors and visitors\u000a      were able to exchange views regarding detecting life beyond Earth, our\u000a      role within the cosmos, and how research on exoplanets relates to a better\u000a      understanding of our home planet. It is this link that explains the\u000a      particular appeal of extra-solar planets to the wider public. An analysis\u000a      of the media coverage of the UK's National Astronomy Meeting found that \"the\u000a        public interest in the topic of extra-solar planets seems to be\u000a        insatiable\". 86% of the public visitors of the exhibition who\u000a      provided feedback stated that their \"interest in science had increased\",\u000a      while 62% of the students declared that they are \"more interested in a\u000a        career in science\", 68% were \"more interested about science in\u000a        general\", and 58.5% were \"more likely to read about science\u000a        outside of school\".\u000a    We can also identify clear evidence of long-term impact in public\u000a        outreach. Our work has featured in widely-distributed long-running\u000a      documentary movies, as well as television programmes such as \"Wonders\u000a        of the Universe\". The film \"Wish You Were Here? Searching for\u000a        Exoplanets\" has now been widely viewed at UK Science Festivals, and\u000a      is currently showing in New York. PHYESTA's exoplanet research also\u000a      triggered and enabled the widely viewed March 2010 \"Life\" episode\u000a      of the BBC series \"The Sky at Night\" [F3] as well as a docu-fiction\u000a      \"The visit &#8212; a documentary from outer space\" (being produced by\u000a      Lise Lense-M&#248;ller, 2010 Academy Award \"Oscar\" nominee for \"Best\u000a      Documentary\") [F4]. In addition, the PHYESTA work on the James Webb Space\u000a      Telescope has featured in the award winning \"We are Astronomers\"\u000a      film [S4], showing at Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh, and six other science\u000a      centres across the UK. As one final example of long-term public impact,\u000a      our efforts to take astronomy outreach to the more remote regions of\u000a      Scotland have been formative in motivating and helping Galloway Forest\u000a      Park to successfully apply for Dark Sky Park status. [F2]\u000a    Impact on Teachers and Education\u000a      PHYESTA's astronomy research has also had a long-term impact in\u000a        education. Over 200 school teachers have attended our Deep Space\u000a      Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses, and have been provided\u000a      with Deep Space resources for use in the classroom. These\u000a      resources are now included in the official SQA Course Unit Support\u000a      document for the new Nat 4 Physics (replacing Standard Grades (= GCSEs) in\u000a      Scotland), and the exoplanet resource has been expanded into a Researching\u000a      Physics topic for the new Higher Physics. These educational resources are\u000a      now being distributed through four outreach centres in England (Leicester,\u000a      Oxford, Portsmouth, Warwick). ROE also supplies resources to the BBC\u000a      Learning website, and the star-charts have proved to be one of the most\u000a      downloaded resources. Commenting on PHYESTA's contributions to secondary\u000a      education, the Head of Section Physics and Technology of the SSERC states\u000a      \"...few, if any, university-funded organisations have quite the impact\u000a        on my work and indeed on Scottish school physics education in general...\".\u000a      [F1]\u000a    Impact on Policy Development and Public Debate\u000a      Our exoplanet work has also had long-term impact in fostering debate\u000a      on the societal implications of the detection of life beyond Earth. To\u000a      encourage the involvement of relevant stakeholder organisations, PHYESTA\u000a      astronomer Martin Dominik proposed and co-organised a Royal Society\u000a      Scientific Discussion Meeting on the detection of extraterrestrial life\u000a      and its consequences [S2]. This meeting was chosen to open the Royal\u000a      Society meeting series in its 350th anniversary year, and\u000a      hosted the first ever pro-and-contra debate about the benefits and risks\u000a      of communication with extra-terrestrial civilisations. This is now being\u000a      followed up by a new study group \"Active SETI: Scientific,\u000a        Technical, Societal &amp; Legal Dimensions\" of the International\u000a      Academy of Astronautics. The meeting received world-wide media coverage\u000a      and has stimulated new debate in the field [S5]. Following this meeting\u000a      PHYESTA has contributed to an agenda for policy development, involving the\u000a      United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), which supports the\u000a      Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). The Director of\u000a      OOSA states the importance of the PHYESTA work: \"The activities\u000a        carried out under the study led by Dr Martin Dominik have, indeed,\u000a        increased public awareness of the United Nations Office for Outer Space\u000a        Affairs (OOSA) and the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of\u000a        Outer Space.

Here we highlight the specific\u000a      areas of high-quality\/high-profile research that are most directly and\u000a      demonstrably related to the outreach and educational programmes and events\u000a      developed at, and delivered by PHYESTA.\u000a    \u000a      PHYESTA's work in cosmology, as exemplified by John Peacock's\u000a        leadership of the 2-degree Field (2dF) survey [R1], is central to\u000a        communicating up-to-date information on such fundamental issues as the\u000a        age of the Universe, its origin and its large-scale structure. The 3-D\u000a        maps of the Universe produced from the 2dF were the deepest and most\u000a        detailed ever made at the time of their publication, and feature in much\u000a        of the Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE) outreach and educational\u000a        materials.\u000a      PHYESTA astronomers have been searching for exoplanets with\u000a        Earth-like compositions since 1995. Using gravitational microlensing to\u000a        detect small, cool planets and more recently HARPS-N to measure the\u000a        densities of transiting super-Earths from the Kepler mission, we\u000a        are finding rocky planets both outside and inside their host stars'\u000a        habitable zones. [R2] outlines the breakthrough discovery by\u000a        microlensing of what was, at the time, the lowest mass exoplanet known,\u000a        using a monitoring strategy developed in and led by PHYESTA. The planet\u000a        was spotted in the data by Martin Dominik supported by the RoboNet-1.0\u000a        project led by Keith Horne. The wider implications of this significant\u000a        step towards the discovery of potentially habitable planets have been\u000a        actively promoted by PHYESTA, generating strong public interest.\u000a      PHYESTA hosts the UK's Wide Field Astronomy Unit (WFAU), responsible\u000a        for making the latest astronomical surveys available to the UK\u000a        and worldwide research communities. Our Open Days exploit the WFAU data\u000a        products to introduce the public to modern survey astronomy. Specific\u000a        use is made of the digitized `all sky' optical survey [R3], and the\u000a        near-infrared UKIDSS WFCAM surveys [R4], with WFAU staff participating\u000a        directly in engaging the public with the data products they themselves\u000a        helped to create.\u000a      In recent years PHYESTA astronomers have co-led the deepest ever\u000a        Hubble near-IR imaging surveys in the search for the first galaxies\u000a          and stars at the end of the `Dark Ages'. These programs have\u000a        yielded the most distant objects known [R5], infant galaxies that\u000a        existed when the Universe was less than a billion years old. This feeds\u000a        directly into outreach\/educational materials on deep space, the origins\u000a        of the Universe, and the technology involved in modern observatories.\u000a    \u000a    Personnel:\u000a    Key PHYESTA researchers involved were Dr Martin Dominik (Royal Society\u000a      University Research Fellow 2006-Present), Dr Nigel Hambly (1999-Present),\u000a      Professor Keith Horne (1994-Present) Dr Ross McLure (2004-Present),\u000a      Professor John Peacock (1998-Present)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35265","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The breadth of impact of the mm-wave activity is mainly evidenced by the\u000a      commercial success associated with the EPR program, but we would also\u000a      point to the success and societal impact of the more general mm-wave\u000a      outreach program that arose from the EPSRC Public Understanding funding.\u000a    Economic Impact.\u000a    Commercialisation of EPR instrumentation is performed under licence by\u000a      our partner Thomas Keating Ltd.

In 2012, Thomas Keating won the Queens Award for\u000a      Enterprise: International Trade [S2]. Sales of mm-wave instrumentation\u000a      based on the original research by Smith made a major contribution to\u000a      that success, with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory providing\u000a      supporting evidence.

Paramagnetic centres and defects can define a materials\u000a      electronic, optical, mechanical, chemical, catalytic and enzymatic\u000a      properties. EPR is a technique that identifies these centres and gives\u000a      detailed information about the local atomic environment and is often able\u000a      to link structure to function. One of the fastest growing applications is\u000a      based on site-directed spin labelling in biochemistry, where pump-probe\u000a      pulse EPR-based techniques (PELDOR measure-ments) are rapidly becoming the\u000a      method of choice for accurate long range distance measurements in\u000a      biomolecules in the 2-12nm range, strongly complementing X-ray\u000a      crystallography and NMR techniques.\u000a    In 1993 Graham Smith, Jim Lesurf and Peter Riedi designed a new type of\u000a      multi-frequency cw mm-wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer\u000a      that employed novel quasi-optical tech-niques. This design [R1] became the\u000a      blueprint [R2] for the first generation of successful high field (mm-wave)\u000a      EPR spectrometers that was adopted by many major mm-wave EPR labs across\u000a      the world. It went on to become an EPSRC National Chemistry Facility run\u000a      by Smith. (GR\/S72306\/01)\u000a    The crucial breakthroughs achieved in realising high performance in a\u000a      (scalable) mm-wave EPR spectrometer were due to the adoption of low loss,\u000a      high performance quasi-optical techniques, combined with the development\u000a      of new mm-wave components and new measurement protocols. The success of\u000a      this project led to a more ambitious funded proposal, led by Smith in\u000a      2003, to the Basic Technology programme of RCUK (GR\/S85719\/01). The\u000a      project, entitled `Bringing the NMR Paradigm to EPR', was the top ranked\u000a      proposal among 140 initial submissions across all scientific disciplines.\u000a      In this four year grant, the first two years were spent developing the\u000a      underlying basic technologies, the next year constructing the instrument\u000a      and the final year developing the control software required to produce\u000a      complex and arbitrary pulse sequences on sub-ns timescales at kW power\u000a      levels. Further development work was funded through a subsequent EPSRC\u000a      translation grant (EP\/F039034\/1). As part of the development work and\u000a      within the on-going associated mm-wave research, the team also developed\u000a      a range of pioneering components including isolators [R3] and corrugated\u000a      feedhorns [R4] that had clear commercial value.\u000a    The new EPR instrument now provides around two orders of magnitude\u000a      improvement in concentration sensitivity compared to Brukers flagship\u000a      X-band (or W-band) commercial system [R5]. (This corresponds to nearly\u000a      four orders of magnitude reduction in averaging time for common pulse\u000a      measurements). To put that into context, the previous 60 years of EPR\u000a      perhaps only saw one order of magnitude improvement in continuous wave\u000a      concentration sensitivity.\u000a    The large range of mm-wave applications and projects within the group,\u000a      together with broader mm-wave applications (car radar, mm-wave astronomy,\u000a      earth resource studies, fusion diagnostics) also led to successful\u000a      outreach bids (e.g. EPSRC grant EP\/H047964\/1) designed to highlight this\u000a      area of science to the general public and attract school children to\u000a      technology and science.\u000a    In 2011 Graham Smith was awarded the Silver Medal for Instrumentation by\u000a      the International EPR Society in recognition of his contribution to EPR\u000a      spectrometer design. The medal is only awarded once every three years\u000a      worldwide. In recognition of the EPR work, Graham Smith, has also been\u000a      invited to assume a number of leadership roles in the UK and international\u000a      communities including: President, European Federation of EPR Groups (2009\u000a      &#8212; Present); Chair of Royal Society of Chemistry EPR Group (2012), Deputy\u000a      Chair, European COST network on \"Advanced Paramagnetic Resonance Methods\u000a      in Molecular Biophysics\" (2003-08).\u000a    Personnel\u000a      Key PHYESTA researchers involved in this work were Dr Graham Smith\u000a      (Present throughout period of assessment), Dr Jim Lesurf (Reader to\u000a      2004, Honorary Reader 2004 - 2013) and Professor Peter Riedi (Professor to\u000a      2003, Professor Emeritus 2003 &#8212; Present), Dr Duncan Robertson (PDRA\u000a      1994-1999, 2000 &#8212; Present), Dr David MacFarlane (PDRA 2002 &#8212; Present), Dr\u000a      Paul Cruickshank (PDRA 2004-2010), Dr David Bolton (PDRA 2005-Present) and\u000a      Dr Robert Hunter (PDRA 2006 &#8212; Present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35266","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    M&#246;lnlycke Health Care is a world-leading manufacturer of wound care\u000a      products and a major service provider to the healthcare sector. Its annual\u000a      sales have grown rapidly from EUR 770M in Q4 2007 to EUR 1,120M in 2012 of\u000a      which approximately 40% derives from its Wound Care Division with the\u000a      remainder coming from its Surgical Division. M&#246;lnlycke Health Care has\u000a      sales operations in 30 countries and 7400 employees worldwide. In wound\u000a      care management, the company has recognised (a) the pressing requirement\u000a      for the development of rapid and sensitive technologies for portable\u000a      medical diagnostics, and (b) that disruptive technologies can arise from\u000a      research at the physical\/life science interface. The company's current\u000a      estimates suggest that automated platforms for chronic wound diagnosis\u000a      will address a global market opportunity of between &#163;1.4bn and &#163;2.8bn by\u000a      2017. In many cases, accurate and rapid diagnosis of wound infection can\u000a      inform treatment and guide isolation measures. Related to this, bacterial\u000a      resistance to antibiotics is a public health issue of increasing\u000a      significance, and there is growing urgency not only for new treatments,\u000a      but also for improved diagnostics of often-lethal infections such as MRSA\u000a      (the hospital \"super-bug\"). Reduced efficacy of antibiotics, and the\u000a      increasing emergence of resistant strains, present serious problems for\u000a      the healthcare industry generally. They represent a key target area for\u000a      M&#246;lnlycke Health Care across its wound-care operations.\u000a    Against the backdrop described above, M&#246;lnlycke has, as a matter of\u000a      priority, sought a route to establishing a competitive presence in the\u000a      diagnostics market for wound infection to complement and enhance its\u000a      sector-leading business in wound-care treatments. This has now been made\u000a      possible as a direct result of underpinning research conducted by the\u000a      PHYESTA-led team. PHYESTA's research on electrochemical impedance\u000a      spectroscopy (EIS) has created a particularly attractive and sensitive\u000a      detection mode which can be readily incorporated into point-of-care\u000a      platforms. This meets the requirements of M&#246;lnlycke Health Care for a\u000a      clinically deployable solution with improved performance over existing\u000a      methods, which is compatible with rapid clinical response in infection\u000a      control. Demonstrator experiments have illustrated the performance of the\u000a      methodology for specific biomarkers of interest. The elimination of the\u000a      PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification step, which forms the basis\u000a      of many biomarker assays but usually takes several hours and\/or skilled\u000a      sample preparation, represents an IP-protected disruptive technology; it\u000a      is a key aspect of the attractiveness of PHYESTA's diagnostic\u000a      methodologies to M&#246;lnlycke [F1].\u000a    The direct detection by EIS of wound-infection biomarkers emerged as\u000a      particularly well aligned to M&#246;lnlycke Health Care's core business\u000a      interests, and was chosen as the primary focus for discussions between\u000a      PHYESTA researchers, their Edinburgh collaborators, and MHC that were\u000a      brokered initially by Scottish Enterprise &#8212; Scotland's national economic\u000a      development and investment agency. In August 2011, Scotland's Finance\u000a      Minister announced the completion of a business partnership with M&#246;lnlycke\u000a      Health Care whereby the company has taken an exclusive licence to IP from\u000a      the Edinburgh team's research project portfolio and established a new\u000a      Scottish subsidiary company: MHC Scotland Ltd. The subsidiary commenced\u000a      operations on 3rd September 2012 and is located in Building 9 BioQuarter,\u000a      within Scotland's flagship life science incubator.\u000a    The establishment of MHC Scotland, and in particular its role in the\u000a      fight against MRSA, has generated significant press coverage [S1].\u000a      Scottish Enterprise has assisted M&#246;lnlycke Health Care in setting up its\u000a      facility at the BioQuarter, culminating in the creation of a new\u000a      Diagnostic Division of MHC which is led from its new Edinburgh subsidiary.\u000a      The impact in 2011-2013, deriving from the underpinning research, is\u000a      primarily on M&#246;lnlycke itself and on the Scottish economy, as evidenced by\u000a      (i) the formation of a significant new business venture and (ii) an\u000a      alteration of business practice through the adoption of a new technology\u000a      and the creation of a new Diagnostic Division.\u000a    As of 2013, MHC Scotland employs 8 full time staff members. Expansion is\u000a      expected, and while the direct economic and healthcare impacts will occur\u000a      only after the current REF period, these developments already establish\u000a      substantial impact by changing the business plans of a major multinational\u000a      company. Indeed, M&#246;lnlycke's primary reason for starting inward investment\u000a      to the UK has been to exploit the results of the PHYESTA-led Edinburgh\u000a      research team. In a recent press statement [S2] the CEO of M&#246;lnlycke\u000a      Health Care comments \"We are delighted to be expanding our\u000a        capabilities and product offering in close collaboration with Scottish\u000a        Enterprise and the University of Edinburgh.

It addressed major limits on detection capabilities of\u000a      infections in situations relevant to a clinical context. Initial work on\u000a      novel molecular detection methods included the development and subsequent\u000a      patenting of a novel class of DNA bio-switches [R1, R2, R3]. These were\u000a      demonstrated to be highly discriminating sensors of nucleic acids. The\u000a      devices employ a unique method of molecular recognition in which the\u000a      optically detected switch characteristics are modified in the presence of\u000a      an unlabelled target. Subsequent work led to several novel modes of\u000a      detection and signal amplification in complex biological matrices.\u000a    Subsequently the same collaboration developed a method for label-free\u000a      electrochemical impedance immunosensing and demonstrated application of\u000a      this method to the detection of infection biomarkers directly from\u000a      biological matrices [R4]. The results showed that there was sufficient\u000a      sensitivity for rapid and clinically relevant wound infection detection. A\u000a      method for label-free, electrochemical impedance immunosensing for the\u000a      detection and quantification of several infection biomarkers was\u000a      demonstrated. Triggering of Receptor-1 Expressed on Myeloid cells (TREM-1)\u000a      and Matrix MetalloPeptidase 9 (MMP-9) were detected via direct assay.\u000a      Other compounds relevant in bacterial quorum sensing were detected using\u000a      competition assays.\u000a    Detection was achieved in less than 1 hour straight from mock wound fluid\u000a      without any extensive sample preparation steps. The sensitivity of\u000a      detection was already near or above the level required for reliable\u000a      diagnosis of infection. Subsequently, an MRSA (hospital superbug) assay\u000a      requiring neither labelling nor amplification of target DNA was reported\u000a      [R5]. Sequence-specific binding of bacterial genomic DNA fragments could\u000a      be detected at femto-molar concentration using electrochemical impedance\u000a      spectroscopy (EIS). Observed detection levels fully met the clinical\u000a      requirements, where the usual definition of an infected wound is 105\u000a      cells\/mL.\u000a    Personnel:\u000a      Key PHYESTA researchers involved were Professor Jason Crain (1993-present)\u000a      and Gerard Giraud (PDRA 2009-2011).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35267","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The Applied Optics group formed a consortium with Thorn, GEC, BNR, Davin\u000d      Optronics, STC, and ENST, to perform research and development of FLCOS\u000d      devices with DTI funding. The local Scottish company, ADMIT Design, used\u000d      the FLCOS demonstrator to attract interest and investment. ADMIT was then\u000d      bought by Central Research Laboratories of Thorn EMI, forming MicroPix\u000d      Technologies Ltd in 1998. They developed the FLCOS microdisplay technology\u000d      into a commercial product. Subsequently in 1995, in a joint venture with\u000d      PicVue Electronics a pilot production company, Microvue, was created in\u000d      Scotland, and an investment of &#163;20m was raised to build a volume\u000d      production plant in Taiwan.\u000d    ForthDD [S1], is the successor company of MicroPix and MicroVue, founded\u000d      in 2005, and based in Dalgety Bay, Fife. They succeeded in bringing the\u000d      technology to production demonstrating that FLCOS microdisplays could be\u000d      made to adequate standard in wafer scale production. Since its formation,\u000d      and over the period of the REF impact window, it has raised in excess of\u000d      US $33M in investment including the 2011 injection of US $14M by the\u000d      leading US microdisplay company, Kopin Corporation [S2]. ForthDD designs,\u000d      develops and manufactures single chip micro-displays used in the most\u000d      demanding segments of markets such as training and simulation systems, HD\u000d      video camera viewfinders, medical imaging systems and virtual-reality and\u000d      head-mounted displays. Entirely digital, providing 24-bit full colour\u000d      images, and capable of handling high-speed motion with no visible\u000d      artefacts, Forth DD's single chip imagers are especially well-matched to\u000d      the new solid state LED and laser diode light sources and provide very\u000d      high native resolution. In late 2012, ForthDD reaffirmed its position as\u000d      the world's leading supplier of advanced microdisplays when it released\u000d      the world's highest resolution full colour microdisplay. ForthDD employs\u000d      over 35 staff, many in posts requiring undergraduate and post-graduate\u000d      qualifications. It has annual revenues in excess of &#163;3M, with exports\u000d      accounting for 95% of its sales. \"A key selling point for Forth\u000d        Dimension Displays is our ability to produce high quality images in\u000d        applications where competing technologies do not quite make the grade.\u000d      Underpinning this image quality are product features enabled by\u000d        technical specifications such as high pixel aperture ratio and accurate\u000d        liquid crystal alignment, that were first established through the\u000d        PHYESTA research on backplane surface quality improvement. The backplane\u000d        surface quality improvement techniques described by the PHYESTA research\u000d        have been adopted by CMOS foundries, such as those from which ForthDD\u000d        obtains the substrates for its current product range.\"\u000d      Director of Product Design, ForthDD [F1].\u000d    The improvements particularly in surface planarity and pixel fill factor\u000d      achieved by PHYESTA researchers were critical enablers in FLCoS\u000d      microdisplay technology, allowing them to exceed the threshold of image\u000d      quality necessary to satisfy customers. The underlying manufacturing\u000d      processes were made available to ForthDD's commercial CMOS foundry\u000d      supplier, through publication and direct transfer, and thus were\u000d      incorporated into product manufacture. The CMOS foundry has continued to\u000d      refine these. Thus the manufacturability, image quality and optical\u000d      efficiency of the current product range and the newly released product\u000d      range rely upon PHYESTA's underlying research into manufacturing\u000d      techniques. Improvements in active device surface planarity and pixel\u000d      filling factors achieved by PHYESTA and collaborators were key\u000d      translational steps. With the exception of the liquid crystal materials\u000d      themselves and aspects of the drive circuitry, the entire ForthDD product\u000d      line is substantially and directly underpinned by PHYESTA innovations in\u000d      optical sciences and materials processing. The collaboration with ForthDD\u000d      remains active with Hossack and other staff continuing to consult and work\u000d      with them.\u000d    PHYESTA\/ERPE research [R6], was quickly incorporated into early products\u000d      and has been continually developed and refined within the company to\u000d      encompass higher colour depth, higher frame rates and higher definition. \"Thus\u000a        every Forth Dimension Displays product, including the most recent\u000d        product range, the QXGA (2048 x 1536 pixel) microdisplay launched in\u000d        October 2012, has used and continues to use pulsed RGB LED illumination\u000d        based upon the original ERPE scheme that was published [R2, R3] as an\u000d        outcome of the foundational ERPE research.\" CEO of ForthDD [F2].\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Impact: Economic gains\u000d    PHYESTA research has led to the setting up of a company now known as\u000d      ForthDD.

The Group operated under the direction of Professor David\u000d      Vass (PHYESTA), who was working on liquid crystal over silicon (LCOS)\u000d      devices with initial interest in their use for optical correlators, beam\u000d      steerers, and beam shapers. The ferroelectric class of liquid crystals\u000d      offered response times an order of magnitude faster than nematic crystals,\u000d      and could be operated in a binary mode suited to driving digital\u000d      applications. However, ferroelectric liquid crystal devices posed severe\u000d      design and manufacturing challenges, as the thickness of the required cell\u000d      was much thinner than conventional nematic liquid crystal based devices.\u000d      Typically a sub-micron thickness is required and flatness, cell\u000d      parallelism and uniformity are also needed to make these devices viable.\u000d      At first commercial manufacturers of silicon wafers regarded such tight\u000d      tolerances as unattainable using conventional processing and polishing\u000d      methods. Vass, Hossack (PHYESTA) and collaborators in the School of\u000d      Engineering developed designs, pulsed illumination methods, polishing\u000d      techniques and silicon planarization (removal of excess curvature that can\u000d      reduce optical coherence and lead to colour artefacts), which produced\u000d      cells of excellent flatness and high reflectivity sufficient for coherent\u000d      optical applications [R1, R2]. This work was undertaken with a SERC SCIOS\u000d      rolling grant, SERC\/DTI Link grant SASLM and EU ESPRIT grant HICPOBS over\u000d      the period 1993-1995 for which Vass was Principal Investigator.\u000d    Further refinements in the device design led to the realisation of smart\u000d      pixel structures including light blocking layers and robust backplane\u000d      electronics enabling a fast digital FLCOS Spatial Light Modulator [R3],\u000d      which was able to operate under intense illumination. This led to\u000d      applications in routers for telecoms, holographic projectors, and optical\u000d      tweezers. The smart algorithms, binary phase holograms, and fast device\u000d      operation were critical in realising real time full speed operation in\u000d      these application areas. The realisation of the FLCOS based holographic\u000d      optical tweezers, permitted for the first time multiple trapping and\u000d      real-time capture of freely moving microbes, as described in a well cited\u000d      paper [R4].\u000d    While more generally applicable these advances directly addressed\u000d      requirements of the emerging technology of microdisplays, which demanded\u000d      improved manufacturing methods to enhance image quality and colour\u000d      fidelity above threshold levels for a practical display. To the basic\u000d      spatial light modulator device we added fast image processing algorithms\u000d      in collaboration with GEC, STC, Admit Design, and Davin Optronics, thereby\u000d      producing the world's first high resolution, video speed, full colour\u000d      FLCOS digital microdisplay. This device was first showcased at the 6th\u000d      International Conference on Ferroelectric Devices hosted by ENST and\u000d      subsequently published in the leading journal for ferroelectric technology\u000d      [R5,R6]. This prototype device was a key development bringing together\u000d      VLSI design, surface planarisation, light blocking layers, fast electronic\u000d      interface and ferroelectric liquid crystals in a fully operational FLCOS\u000d      device. This work was undertaken over the period 1995-1998.\u000d    Personnel:\u000d    The key PHYESTA researchers involved were Professor David Vass\u000d      (1993-2004; category A in 2001 RAE return), Dr Will Hossack (Academic\u000d      staff, 1993-present), Professor Jason Crain (1993-present) and Dr Jochen\u000d      Arlt (Senior PDRA and COSMIC laboratory manager).\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35268","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Building directly on the above research, a well-publicised PHYESTA-IBM\u000a      collaboration developed a portfolio of benchmarks for life science\u000a      applications of HPC focussing on scalable molecular dynamics methods.\u000a      These were developed initially for the first generation of IBM's Blue Gene\u000a      supercomputers and subsequently formed the basis of a series of\u000a      application demonstrators for life science problems. The demonstrator\u000a      portfolio benchmarked the ability of Blue Gene systems to deliver\u000a      enhancements in biomolecular simulation, and showed the accuracy of IBM's\u000a      methodology by comparing simulations with a series of experiments on the\u000a      liquid state structure of biomolecules including peptides. This joint work\u000a      is recognized by IBM as contributing to sales in its life sciences\u000a      business since 2008.\u000a    In early 2000, IBM began serious efforts to exploit the transformational\u000a      opportunities that HPC, and specifically molecular simulation, then held\u000a      for the healthcare industry. The then General Manager of IBM Life Sciences\u000a      noted that it offered \"probably the greatest new market opening in IT\u000a        that we see on the horizon.\" [text removed for publication]. By\u000a      2002, IBM had spent over $150 million establishing partnerships and\u000a      alliances, alongside $100 million in venture capital investments made to\u000a      gain access to cutting-edge technologies via start-up acquisitions. [text\u000a        removed for publication]. IBM's Blue Gene project began with a grand\u000a      challenge declaration that the company would create a Petaflop\u000a      supercomputer to address major scientific problems, with a particular\u000a      focus on life sciences and biomolecular structure prediction. The\u000a      life-sciences part of the project had two main business drivers: (1) to\u000a      demonstrate to the pharmaceutical and biomedical sectors that rational\u000a      structure prediction and rational design could be achieved via large-scale\u000a      simulation methods, with accurate results when tested against\u000a      high-resolution experimental data; and (2) to develop new simulation\u000a      methods and algorithms for the massively parallel machine architectures\u000a      that would be delivered by the Blue Gene hardware.\u000a    PHYESTA's contributions directly addressed IBM's requirement to improve\u000a      the impact and uptake of high-performance computing in the life sciences,\u000a      which was (and still is) seen as a key growth sector for the company. Our\u000a      cutting-edge research and validated measurements were used by the company\u000a      as a way to establish customer and in-house confidence in the application\u000a      of its HPC product portfolio to high profile problems in life sciences\u000a      such as protein structure and function. To achieve that confidence, IBM\u000a      recognized the requirement to develop new computational methods, coupled\u000a      with carefully coordinated experimental measurements (which IBM does not\u000a      perform in-house). It recognized PHYESTA researchers as leaders in both\u000a      fields and hence partners of choice. Professor Crain spent 2004 on\u000a      sabbatical as a salaried staff member at IBM (TJ Watson Research Center,\u000a      Yorktown Heights), and since then he has held a visiting position there\u000a      (2005-present). His work with IBM included extensive neutron diffraction\u000a      studies and optical spectroscopic measurements, as well as the\u000a      incorporation of direct neutron diffraction structure factor evaluation\u000a      from molecular dynamics trajectories. These advances formed a key part of\u000a      definitive benchmarking exercises to test force field and sampling methods\u000a      in highly disordered liquids, which demonstrated the capacity of IBM's HPC\u000a      products to accurately model aqueous solutions of amino acids, small\u000a      peptides and ultimately proteins. The specific methods developed for\u000a      determining diffraction profiles directly from molecular dynamics\u000a      trajectories were not only used in the demonstrator portfolio, but also\u000a      form part of the data analysis suite in the OpenAtom software package\u000a      released in 2009\/2010. OpenAtom is a fine-grained parallel ab initio\u000a      molecular dynamics code optimised for Blue Gene and other platforms.\u000a    An IBM team leader responsible for Blue Gene applications highlights the\u000a      PHYESTA contributions to building the company's life science business,\u000a      noting specifically that the interaction has \"spawned new\u000a        technological and business opportunities in the life sciences\" and\u000a      that engagement in the early phases of the Blue Gene project has \"helped\u000a        to drive sales\" [F1]. IBM does not disclosed Blue Gene sales figures\u000a      to life sciences companies even in aggregate. (This is unsurprising since\u000a      large corporations might easily glean competitor information from such\u000a      figures.) However, since the release of Blue Gene P (the second generation\u000a      of machine in the Blue Gene series) in 2008, IBM's overall life science\u000a      business, which includes Blue Gene alongside other products and services,\u000a      has grown to achieve revenues of one billion dollars annually. A growing\u000a      part of IBM's business model is to perform high-level computational\u000a      research on behalf of client companies who lack the relevant expertise to\u000a      do so themselves, using Blue Gene and other platforms within IBM. The\u000a      company is now established as a prominent player in the application of IT\u000a      infrastructure to healthcare challenges, and operates a stand-alone\u000a      computational biology center (CBC) to interface to its life science\u000a      business streams. Beyond the life sciences context, the Blue Gene platform\u000a      has become IBM's premier HPC product line and, since 2008, a major\u000a      business stream with high profile multi-rack installations at US National\u000a      Labs and in Europe, 5 of which hold positions in the top 20 supercomputers\u000a      in the world.\u000a    PHYESTA's work with IBM has led to improved algorithms for computer\u000a      simulation, implementation of replica exchange molecular dynamics on Blue\u000a      Gene, the development of scalable molecular dynamics modelling software\u000a      implemented on Blue Gene, and new data analysis tools as well as\u000a      experimental measurements against which to validate the simulations. This\u000a      has enabled IBM to offer improved HPC solutions to customers in the\u000a      business-critical target market of pharmaceuticals and life sciences. [text\u000a        removed for publication]. PHYESTA's role in the enhancement of IBM's\u000a      products and services has improved the ability of its client companies in\u000a      the life sciences sector to efficiently pursue product discovery and\u000a      development. This represents a significant secondary impact on these\u000a      enterprises, and probably also tertiary impact on patient healthcare\u000a      (although the latter is mainly prospective at this stage). Such knock-on\u000a      impacts are hard to quantify, but we can give one exemplar of secondary\u000a      impact because we were directly involved in it.\u000a    Soon after the initial demonstrator portfolio was in place, PHYESTA and\u000a      IBM staff set up a joint project with a UK healthcare SME, Mologic. The\u000a      shared goal was to develop a single assay platform for the detection of\u000a      cancer biomarkers. PHYESTA and IBM used computational modelling\u000a      approaches, as developed for the demonstrator portfolio, on Blue Gene\u000a      hardware, to establish the structural basis behind the complex binding\u000a      behaviour observed in one of Mologic's most promising antibody candidates,\u000a      greatly refining their understanding of the molecular recognition\u000a      mechanism. According to the supporting statement from Mologic's Chief\u000a      Scientific Officer [F2] \"we had no way of taking this forward to\u000a        challenge, substantiate or refine our hypothesis &#8212; an impasse which was,\u000a        to say the least, frustrating, given the commercial importance of the\u000a        antibody family in question\". As a result of Mologic's joint work\u000a      with PHYESTA and IBM, a single high-fidelity epitope was discovered, and\u000a      is now under development by Mologic as a universal single-site hCG assay\u000a      with particular applications in cancer screening. Although not yet at the\u000a      stage to impact upon patients, this certainly represents an altered\u000a      business strategy for Mologic, in which HPC simulation was introduced to\u000a      solve a specific healthcare challenge that had not yielded to traditional\u000a      discovery approaches. This exemplifies the type of uplift in business\u000a      practice and technology that IBM Life Sciences is now offering to client\u000a      companies across the sector. The work with Mologic was recently featured\u000a      as an outstanding example of industry-academic collaboration in Drug\u000a      Discovery World, a leading pharma development title [S1].\u000a    Our relationship with IBM has been used in the company's recruitment\u000a      information and promotional videos, and has been highlighted by Scotland's\u000a      First Minister as an \"exemplary University-Industry collaboration\"\u000a      [S2]. The initial announcement of the joint effort between PHYESTA and IBM\u000a      was heavily promoted, particularly in regard to the early phases of the\u000a      Blue Gene programme and our work on HIV viral protein fragments\u000a      simulations [S3]. The work was featured as one of IBM's \"Icons of\u000a      Progress\" case studies in 2011, and is one of the IBM Centenary exemplars\u000a      of University relationships [S4]. This campaign attracted considerable\u000a      media attention from the BBC, Yahoo Finance, other news agencies [S5], as\u000a      well as a wide range of pharma trade journals where IBM highlighted the\u000a      importance of the PHYESTA work to the growth of HPC in the life sciences\u000a      sector, focussing specifically on the need for stringent experimental\u000a      validation of codes and algorithms as pioneered by PHYESTA [S6].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Impact: Economic gains, healthcare.\u000a      Since 2008 IBM has greatly expanded the division of its business that\u000a      produces and markets High Performance Computing (HPC) products for the\u000a      life sciences sector.

A great strength has been our coordinated use of computer\u000a      simulation and experimental measurement to advance molecular models,\u000a      capable of linking structure to function in complex and self-assembling\u000a      systems.\u000a    The underpinning research began in 2000 [R1], and includes a seminal\u000a      paper in 2002 overturning previous views of hydrophobic hydration in\u000a      simple molecular systems such as mixtures of water and short-chain\u000a      alcohols [R2]. In this work, isotopically-labelled neutron diffraction\u000a      measurements were coupled with novel data analysis methods to show that\u000a      even in simple alcohol-water mixtures a rich variety of self-assembled\u000a      structures are formed. These previously unidentified structures were then\u000a      shown to be the molecular cause of the strongly non-ideal thermodynamics\u000a      shown by such mixtures. This work overturned the prevailing models (dating\u000a      from 1945) in which ice-like structures were assumed to form around\u000a      non-polar groups. Further work [R3] combined spectroscopic measurements,\u000a      diffraction and advanced simulation. This led to improved thermodynamic\u000a      models for the entropy of mixing in these simple systems and the\u000a      demonstration that intermediate-range percolating molecular networks arise\u000a      within particular ranges of concentration. This experimental and\u000a      simulation work on the complex structure of simple molecular mixtures\u000a      established an ideal benchmark for the development and evaluation of new\u000a      simulation algorithms and code architectures, which could then be applied\u000a      to more complex, biologically relevant molecules and materials.\u000a    Subsequent work moved decisively into the biological domain by addressing\u000a      short proteins motifs in the form of peptide fragments [R4, R5]. Here the\u000a      proper representation of hydrogen bonding and of the peptide bond in\u000a      computer models was carefully explored and extensively tested against our\u000a      experimental data. Optimizing the computational treatment of these is a\u000a      crucial step to addressing larger proteins and simulating their folding\u000a      dynamics and assembly. Work on our peptide fragments (or 'minimal\u000a      biomolecules') was rapidly accepted as an ideal testing ground for many\u000a      aspects of biological self-assembly and rational structure prediction,\u000a      which are amenable to both high-resolution experiment and massively\u000a      parallel High Performance Computer (HPC) simulation. For this reason they\u000a      formed the initial target demonstrators for life-science applications of\u000a      IBM's new Blue Gene hardware.\u000a    Personnel:\u000a      Key PHYESTA researchers involved were Professor Jason Crain\u000a      (1993-present), Professor Simon Bates (2003-2011) and Paul Tulip (PDRA\u000a      2005-2008).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35269","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The primary impact has been and continues to be the successful\u000a      manufacture and commercialisation with growing worldwide sales of two\u000a      innovative photonic products by the company M Squared Lasers Ltd, based in\u000a      Glasgow. [F1] In addition the commercial availability of such\u000a      technologically advanced devices through M Squared Lasers Ltd, continues\u000a      to have a worldwide secondary impact on user communities, such as those\u000a      engaged in applied research. Particular examples of this latter include\u000a      the Defence Science &amp; Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down\u000a      [F2], the Oil and Gas Sector in general, and Defence R &amp; D Canada\u000a      (DRDC).\u000a    In order to achieve maximum impact from our work, the University filed\u000a      patents in key areas of licensable technology based on such insights prior\u000a      to publication through the usual academic routes [S1]. In parallel, the\u000a      intellectual property residing within the patent portfolio was widely\u000a      promoted through personal contacts. As a result of these activities M\u000a      Squared Lasers Ltd approached the University which led to licensing\u000a      agreements for manufacture\/commercialisation, accompanied by a continuing\u000a      interaction to effectively attain total technology transfer. The licensing\u000a      to M Squared Lasers Ltd in 2008 of the intellectual property \/know-how\u000a      based on the above identified key research insights has resulted in two\u000a      emergent product lines based on our intellectual property (among a total\u000a      of five product lines currently on offer by the Company). These are the\u000a      \"Firefly-THz\" range of Pulsed Tuneable Terahertz Lasers, and the\u000a      \"Firefly-IR\" range of Widely Tuneable Mid &#8212; and Near-IR Pulsed Lasers\u000a      [S2]. In the case of the Firefly-IR a hyperspectral imager based on the\u000a      licensed intellectual property has also been developed as a complementary\u000a      product.\u000a    Annual Net Sales for the two Firefly systems in 2012-13 have amounted to\u000a      &#163;432K to date; with Net Sales showing an average compounded annual growth\u000a      rate over the four years of the licence of 90%\/annum. Overall 50% of\u000a      company sales are in North America, with a further 30% in Asia [F1]. The\u000a      income to the University from royalties arising from the above\u000a      commercialisation activity in 2012-13 was &#163;60K.\u000a    The technology transfer activity overall was summed up by the CEO of M\u000a      Squared Lasers Ltd in the following statement: \"St\u000a        Andrews have been instrumental in allowing M Squared to develop this\u000a        important new technology and their approach to ensuring \"impact\" from\u000a        their research is in our opinion the gold standard for such activities.\u000a        M Squared is highly collaborative and our team has been involved in many\u000a        technology transfers from universities but the St Andrew's team's\u000a        thorough, collaborative, and energetic approach has been our best\u000a        experience in such endeavours.\" [F1]\u000a    The commercial availability of the Firefly-IR product through M Squared\u000a      Lasers Ltd has had significant impact on the research and development work\u000a      of the DSTL Detection Department at Porton Down. Hyperspectral imaging\u000a      systems based upon the Firefly-IR laser have been used extensively in\u000a      trials for the remote sensing and imaging of hazardous chemicals and\u000a      compounds. As the Principal Scientist, DSTL comments: \"The unique\u000a        compact OPO design you pioneered has enabled the realisation of a\u000a        prototype IR imager for the stand-off detection of chemical warfare\u000a        agents.\" [F2] This resulted in a further impact advantage for M\u000a      Squared Lasers Ltd in that DSTL have placed a number of contracts with\u000a      them for the further development and refinement of the laser and the\u000a      associated hyperspectral imaging system to a total value of &#163;1.5M.\u000a    This work was highlighted at the Centre for Defence Enterprise Showcase\u000a      Event held in London on 13th January 2011, leading to a half-page,\u000a      illustrated article in the Daily Star [S3] and inclusion on the British\u000a      Forces News Channel. In October-November 2012 field trials were extended\u000a      to the USA in a collaboration involving personnel from DSTL, M Squared\u000a      Lasers and the US-Army Edgewood Chemical &amp; Biological Center (ECBC);\u000a      this work was selected for publication by the SPIE Newsroom Website [S5].\u000a    In 2012 M Squared Lasers was ranked eighth by accountants Deloitte in a\u000a      list of the UK's 50 fastest-growing technology firms; being placed top in\u000a      Scotland. The Firefly laser range was identified as a key technology in\u000a      enabling growth of more than 1600% in the last 5 years [S4]. An additional\u000a      impact associated with the licensing of the key research insights has been\u000a      to enhance the ability of M Squared Lasers Ltd to access venture capital.\u000a      Additional funding of &#163;3.85M for development has been received from the\u000a      Business Growth Fund with the role of firefly particularly highlighted: \"In\u000a        particular, we are looking at new market opportunities in remote\u000a        sensing, and will specifically focus on developing our Firefly laser\u000a        product, which has a clear application for the security and defence, oil\u000a        and gas and food and drink industries.\" [S6] In October 2012 the UK\u000a      Technology Strategy Board funded two hyper-spectral imaging projects based\u000a      on the company's Firefly optical parametric oscillators under a strategy\u000a      aimed at promoting innovation in the Oil &amp; Gas Sector.\u000a    In a recent development (January 2013), the partnership between M Squared\u000a      Lasers Ltd and PHYESTA has been enhanced by the involvement of the\u000a      newly-established Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics based in\u000a      Glasgow. This centre offers new opportunities for enhanced technology\u000a      transfer activity, in particular with regard to the \"Firefly\" product\u000a      range, through collaborative effort involving all three partners. As\u000a      remarked by the Head of the Fraunhofer Centre: \"We are enthusiastic\u000a          supporters of this work because of the combination of scientific\u000a          excellence, commercial relevance and its potential in addressing real\u000a          world problems.\" [F3]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Impact: Economic\u000a      Based on research carried out within PHYESTA, a range of novel laser\u000a      devices have been produced and sold under licence by M Squared Lasers Ltd\u000a      Glasgow.\u000a    Significance: The products have significantly expanded the M\u000a      Squared product range and have led to increased sales and new customer\u000a      relationships.\u000a    Reach: M-Squared have marketed these lasers worldwide and has had\u000a      major sales from customers in the defence and oil and gas sectors.

The nonlinear optical process of parametric\u000a      generation is the basis of a technology of unprecedented flexibility for\u000a      the production of widely-tuneable coherent light from the ultraviolet to\u000a      the THz region. Such sources can generate coherent light of unprecedented\u000a      optical quality, both with regard to spectral (continuously-tuneable,\u000a      single-frequency light), and spatial (single transverse mode)\u000a      characteristics, thereby opening up an increasing range of applications.\u000a    The particular research insights and findings underpinning the impact\u000a      described here relate to optical parametric oscillators operating (a) in\u000a      the terahertz (THz) and (b) in the mid infrared (mid-IR) spectral ranges.\u000a      In the former case novel photonic devices have been developed for\u000a      generating continuously and widely tuneable THz. The novel intersecting\u000a      cavity geometry (patented) employed allows the nonlinear medium to be\u000a      located in both the resonant cavity of the pump laser and the resonant\u000a      cavity of the parametric oscillator, referred to as an intra-cavity\u000a      geometry, while still retaining wide and continuous tuning. This results\u000a      in substantially increased efficiencies compared to the former\u000a      state-of-the art, thereby leading to compact and portable devices. [R1,\u000a      R2]. This work has resulted in a range of filed and granted patent\u000a      applications.\u000a    The research insights relating to the mid-IR spectral range includes\u000a      lasers incorporating high-repetition rate intra-cavity parametric\u000a      oscillators, in particular for hyperspectral imaging applications [R3].\u000a      These developments allowed the development of devices particularly suited\u000a      for real-time video imaging [R4]. Two patents have been awarded in\u000a      connection with these developments.\u000a    Our work has also focussed on solving problems involved in operating\u000a      lasers incorporating intra-cavity parametric oscillators in\u000a      continuous-wave mode. In this case, insights have been gained into the\u000a      problem of severe relaxation oscillations that occur in such devices. In\u000a      the case where gain media with long upper state lifetimes (compared to\u000a      cavity decay times) are used, we have shown that the incorporation of a\u000a      nonlinear medium for second harmonic generation in the cavity of the pump\u000a      laser suppresses such oscillations with little loss in the down conversion\u000a      efficiency [R5]. An alternative approach that we have demonstrated is that\u000a      the using semiconductors as gain media eliminates the problem as a result\u000a      of the very short upper laser state lifetime [R6]. Two patents have been\u000a      filed in connection with these research insights.\u000a    Personnel:\u000a      Key PHYESTA researchers involved were Professor Malcolm H Dunn (present\u000a      throughout period of assessment) with Dr Cameron F.

The use of this technology underlies a wide range\u000a      of applications that have emerged since the 1990s and have developed\u000a      rapidly throughout the period of assessment (2008 - 2013.) These range\u000a      from the development of ultraprecise measurements of frequency required\u000a      for internet communications to the latest generation of techniques for\u000a      corrective eye surgery. The importance of the work of the ULG is\u000a      highlighted by the CEO of Femtolasers who states \"...the work of\u000a        Professor Sibbett and more recently Dr Brown and Professor Sibbett has\u000a        played a major role in leading the development and applications of\u000a        ultrafast laser technology...\" [F1].\u000a    The development of practical technologies to achieve mode-locked laser\u000a      operation was the underpinning requirement for the global development of\u000a      ultrafast technology in the 1990s and its subsequent adaptation into a\u000a      widely adopted technology from the early 2000s to the present day. Work in\u000a      the field by the ULG was of major influence in defining product\u000a      technologies for major multinational companies in the field including\u000a      Coherent and Spectra Physics (now part of Newport) in the USA. This\u000a      adoption led directly to the development of a suite of commercial devices\u000a      (Coherent MIRA and Spectra Physics Tsunami) that continue to underpin the\u000a      commercial sector. The scale of the success of these technologies can be\u000a      estimated by the fact that \"...there are many thousands of Titanium\u000a        Sapphire Kerr lens mode-locked lasers installed worldwide...\" [F2] A\u000a      conservative estimate of $100k per system in 2013 shows that this market\u000a      alone is worth many $100s million. The more recent work described above\u000a      continues to have a major influence on the decision making processes of\u000a      these leading international companies as the Advanced R&amp;D Manager for\u000a      Spectra-Physics states \"...the work of your St Andrews research group\u000a        ... has continued to be of interest and influence within the commercial\u000a        laser community.\" [F3]\u000a    In addition to product development by major commercial players, the\u000a      research highlighted above also has led to the development of laser\u000a      systems by the smaller specialist laser companies such as M Squared in the\u000a      UK, FemtoLasers, a multi-million &#8364; turnover SME in Austria [F1] and KML\u000a      Inc in the USA with new product launches occurring throughout 2008 - 2013.\u000a      Continuing through the period 2008 - 2013, new commercial laser systems,\u000a      amplifiers and applications such as multi-photon microscopes have begun\u000a      to further revolutionise fields as diverse as biology, medicine and\u000a      manufacturing technology. Indeed, the source technology has now reached\u000a      such a point of maturity that it is now routinely installed as OEM\u000a      components within products such as systems for eye surgery [S1].\u000a    The impact of the research can also be identified through its influence\u000a      on a range of applications that impinge on many areas of society. [text\u000a      removed for publication]. A major recent development has been the\u000a      deployment of ultrafast lasers within medical treatments, particularly for\u000a      surgery on the eye. For example, the IntraLase system now offers\u000a      commercial refractive surgery to more than five million of patients\u000a      worldwide and the latest generation of treatment for cataracts is based on\u000a      the use of ultrafast laser systems related to those developed by Sibbett.\u000a      [S2]\u000a    The measurement and characterisation of ultrafast pulses remains an area\u000a      of key importance within this technology field. The ULG showed that a\u000a      highly simplified method based on non-linear absorption in low cost\u000a      semiconductor devices could be used to obtain basic pulse duration\u000a      information. This innovation was patent protected (US6195167 B1 - granted\u000a      2001) and subsequently licensed by Elliot Scientific to produce an award\u000a      winning commercial product, the Timewarp Autocorrelator. [S3]\u000a    A major impact of the work of the Sibbett group has been one of\u000a      influence. A study in 2010 of emerging ultrahigh intensity laser\u000a      facilities shows that there was more than $4.5 Bn of activities under\u000a      development between then and 2015 and more than half of these are based on\u000a      technology directly developed within PHYESTA [S4]. Notably, many major\u000a      companies and individuals have highlighted the importance of the work in\u000a      the 1 f06dm and 2 f06dm spectral regions from 2000 onwards and in\u000a      diode-pumped femtosecond lasers to product development [F1, F3-5]. [text\u000a      removed for publication].\u000a    A 2008 survey showed that the ultrafast laser market was worth\u000a      approximately $260M annually with a predicted year-on-year growth of up to\u000a      30% [S4]. Many of the developments in this field have been influenced and\u000a      underpinned by the work of the Sibbett Group that retains a place of major\u000a      world influence within the field both through its historic and on-going\u000a      research.

Within this period of assessment,\u000a      work within PHYESTA has helped to improve the operational parameters of\u000a      the most commonly deployed femtosecond Ti-sapphire lasers to achieve pulse\u000a      durations as short as 5 femtoseconds and average powers of watts and peak\u000a      powers up to megawatts[R1].\u000a    The Ti:Sapphire crystal gain medium, whilst remaining perhaps the key\u000a      technology for solid-state ultrashort pulse lasers, suffers some major\u000a      disadvantages, including the requirement for high-power pump lasers in\u000a      the difficult-to-access green part of the spectrum reducing efficiency and\u000a      driving up costs. To this end, work was undertaken by the Ultrafast Lasers\u000a      Group in the mid-to late 1990s and 2000s on a range of other gain\u000a      materials that demonstrated the potential for direct diode pumped\u000a      femtosecond lasers in the near-infrared part of the spectrum (800 nm &#8212;\u000a      1100 nm) [R2-R4] opening up the potential for new products and application\u000a      from sources that have the potential for much lower cost and higher\u000a      operating efficiencies. A major drive in this period was also the\u000a      development of advanced laser cavity designs that permitted the\u000a      development of very compact ultrafast lasers that still offer attractive\u000a      output performance levels [R3]. The research has continued and in the\u000a      2010s research and development relating to new spectral areas, including\u000a      the important 2 f06dm region, offer exciting potential for an enlarged\u000a      array of applications in surgery, communications and metrology [R5].\u000a    In addition to the development of new laser sources, the group also\u000a      demonstrated in 1997 a range of original and innovative measurement\u000a      techniques providing a step change in the simplicity and practicality of\u000a      the measurement of ultrafast pulses through 2-photon based autocorrelation\u000a      schemes [R6].\u000a    Personnel\u000a    Key PHYESTA researchers involved were Professor Wilson Sibbett (present\u000a      as staff, and then emeritus, throughout period of assessment), Dr Derryck\u000a      Reid (PDRA \/ EPSRC Advanced Fellow 1994 - 2000), Dr Alexander Lagatsky\u000a      (PDRA 2001 - 2013) and Dr Tom Brown (PDRA 1999 - 2005, Lecturer \/ Senior\u000a      Lecturer \/ Reader 2005 - present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35271","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    MPI is the ubiquitous de-facto standard for programming parallel systems.\u000a      The role of EPCC in its development and implementation is acknowledged by\u000a      independent authorities [S1, S2]. MPI can be used to run parallel\u000a      applications on large-scale high performance computing (HPC)\u000a      infrastructures, local clusters or multi-core desktop computers. To be\u000a      compliant with the MPI standard, implementations must support the\u000a      operations for point-to-point and collective communications, groups and\u000a      communicators, which are the parts of MPI to which Clarke directly\u000a      contributed. There are now myriad MPI implementations, both open source\u000a      and commercial, many of which were produced (and many continually used)\u000a      within the REF impact window. For example, MVAPICH, an open source\u000a      derivative of MPICH, for use with high-performance networks, has recorded\u000a      over 182,000 downloads and over 2,070 users in 70 countries, including 765\u000a      companies [S3]. Among these we cite IBM as an example of a leading HPC\u000a      supplier using MPI [S4].\u000a    The `top500' is a list of the most powerful super-computers published\u000a      twice yearly [S5]. The benchmark used to rank these systems is Linpack,\u000a      which is parallelised using MPI. Consequently, all top500 ranked\u000a      supercomputers run MPI by definition. More significantly, the Linpack\u000a      benchmark is itself chosen in large part because so many of the world's\u000a      most powerful machines run MPI- based software applications on a frequent\u000a      or continuous basis.\u000a    EPCC serves on the HPC Advisory Council [S6], which includes over 300\u000a      hardware and software vendors, HPC centres and selected end-users,\u000a      including 3M, Bull, CDC, Dell, EPCC, Hitachi, HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft,\u000a      NEC Corporation of America, NVIDIA, Schlumberger, SGI, STFC, and Viglen.\u000a      In the Council's online survey of best practices, covering 45 commercial\u000a      packages, all but one uses MPI. These commercial packages span a range of\u000a      applications including finite element analysis (ABAQUS-Dassault Systemes,\u000a      MSC NASTRAN for MEA-MSC Software), material modelling (ABAQUS-Dassault\u000a      Systemes), computational fluid dynamics (AcuSolve-Acusim, CFX and\u000a      FLUENT-ANSYS, FLOW-3D-FLOW Science, OpenFOAM-OpenCFD Ltd, STAR-CCM+-CD-\u000a      adapco), molecular dynamics (D.E. Shaw Research), oil and gas reservoir\u000a      simulation (ECLIPSE- Schlumberger), and crash simulation\u000a      (LS-DYNA-Livermore Software Technology Corporation).\u000a    Without MPI, hardware vendors would face an inefficient marketplace for\u000a      their hardware, as users would need to develop their software to use\u000a      vendor-specific infrastructure which would limit the portability of their\u000a      software, and so limit the ability of users to migrate to other hardware\u000a      platforms. For software vendors, MPI opens up possibilities for users to\u000a      seamlessly exploit multi-core, multi- processor, cloud or supercomputer\u000a      architectures, and so more readily access increased computing power. Since\u000a      MPI's inception in 1994, EPCC\/PHYESTA has collaborated with hardware and\u000a      software vendors to exploit MPI to deliver these benefits within a\u000a      commercial context. We next present some recent examples of this, which\u000a      show how MPI has delivered economic impact. These are a small sample of\u000a      the ways in which MPI is used daily in commerce and industry around the\u000a      world (mostly with no PHYESTA involvement beyond its role in the\u000a      development of MPI itself).\u000a    Cray Inc. have been a leading hardware vendor for over 40 years. In the\u000a      early 90s Cray contributed to the development of the MPI specification.\u000a      EPCC and Cray together developed one of the first MPI implementations,\u000a      CRI\/EPCC for the Cray T3D machine [R6]. Cray's Manager for Exoscale\u000a      Research Europe states: \"Today, a Cray MPI library is distributed with\u000a        every Cray system and is the dominant method of parallelisation used on\u000a        Cray systems. Cray reported total revenue of over $420 million in 2012,\u000a        so this is a large industry which is heavily reliant on MPI and the work\u000a        that EPCC contributed in this regard\" [F1]. Cray and EPCC continue\u000a      to collaborate on programming model development and research, on MPI and\u000a      other programming models, for example, enhancing MPI for exascale as part\u000a      of the FP7 funded EPiGRAM project. Facts in this paragraph are confirmed\u000a      in [F1].\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    In 2013, EPCC worked with Integrated Environmental Systems (IES). (This\u000a      was done as part of SuperComputing Scotland, a joint EPCC-Scottish\u000a      Enterprise programme [S7].) IES is the world's leading provider of\u000a      software and consultancy services on energy efficiency within the built\u000a      environment. IES's SunCast software allows architects and designers to\u000a      analyse the sun's shadows and the effects of solar gains on the thermal\u000a      performance and comfort of buildings. SunCast calculates the effect of the\u000a      sun's rays on every surface at every hour of a design day, a total of 448\u000a      separate calculations. Porting SunCast to run over Microsoft MPI allows\u000a      for the parallel processing of surfaces, one per processor. When a\u000a      processor has completed a surface, it notifies the controlling processor\u000a      of its results and that it is ready to be assigned another surface. With\u000a      MPI, SunCast can now run on a supercomputer with order-of-magnitude time\u000a      savings for analyses &#8212; from 30 days to 24 hours in one example. These\u000a      facts are confirmed in [F3] where IES Director, Craig Wheatley, also\u000a      comments: \"Additionally, using the MPI in IES Consultancy has\u000a        increased the efficiency and therefore profitability of our own\u000a        consultancy offering and to date we have used it with 4 live projects\u000a        with an average analysis time of under 12 hours. These particular\u000a        projects were very large and complex and would otherwise have taken\u000a        several weeks.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Impact: Economic gains\u000a    The Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC) made substantial\u000a      contributions to the development of MPI and produced some of its first\u000a      implementations; CHIMP\/MPI, and CRI\/EPCC MPI, for Cray T3D and Cray T3E\u000a      supercomputers.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u0009  \u000a    Significance: MPI is the ubiquitous de-facto standard for\u000a      programming parallel computers.

CHIMP was a portable\u000a      parallel software library which provided a set of standard interfaces that\u000a      ran on parallel hardware from multiple vendors. ([R5] was among Trew's\u000a      outputs in Edinburgh's physics RAE1996.)\u000a    In 1994, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) 1.0 standard [R6], was\u000a      released by the Message Passing Interface Forum (MPIF), a collaboration\u000a      body of over 40 organisations from academia and industry including leading\u000a      hardware vendors Cray, IBM, Intel, Meiko, NEC and Thinking Machines.\u000a      CHIMP's influences on this standard were substantial, and facilitated by\u000a      Clarke's engagement with the MPIF, where he served as a coordinator of the\u000a      \"Groups, Contexts and Communicators\" sub- group. Prior to CHIMP, most\u000a      message passing interfaces used a single global communications context and\u000a      collective communications across all processes in a system. CHIMP\u000a      introduced message contexts to isolate communications between\u000a      independently communicating processes, and collective communications\u000a      within specific process groups. This exploits the fact that not all\u000a      computational processes need to receive all communications within the\u000a      system. These ideas are directly encapsulated within MPI's defining\u000a      concepts of groups, contexts and communicators [R6].\u000a    In 1994 PHYESTA researchers produced one of the first implementations of\u000a      the MPI standard, CHIMP\/MPI, followed in 1995 by CRI\/EPCC MPI, a native\u000a      implementation developed by EPCC and Cray Inc. for the Cray T3D and Cray\u000a      T3E supercomputers. CRI\/EPCC MPI included an implementation of\u000a      single-sided communications for remote memory access, which had been\u000a      proposed for MPI and was subsequently adopted as part of the MPI-2\u000a      specification, released in 1997. Under Clarke's influence, MPIF had\u000a      identified these as important upgrade areas. MPI-3 was published in\u000a      September 2012 and continues to acknowledge the important contributions\u000a      made by EPCC, who in turn continue to contribute to the work of the MPI\u000a      Forum.

The research was\u000a      seeking to understand how optical and electrical properties of organic\u000a      semiconductors relate to their structure, and then apply this\u000a      understanding to developing improved materials for organic light-emitting\u000a      diodes (OLEDs). The idea of light-emitting dendrimers was developed\u000a      jointly with Professor Paul Burn (University of Oxford.) This technology\u000a      was an alternative to light-emitting polymers and evaporated small\u000a      molecules that were the dominant OLED materials at the time. A dendrimer\u000a      is a highly branched molecule, and the idea was to have a core which would\u000a      define key electronic properties such as the colour of light emission,\u000a      dendrons to keep the cores apart, and surface groups around the outside of\u000a      the macromolecule to confer solubility and favourable processing\u000a      properties. By using such a modular molecular architecture, it was hoped\u000a      that better OLED materials could be made.\u000a    By 2000, we had made some light-emitting dendrimers, but the efficiency\u000a      of OLEDs made from them was very low (around 0.1%) whilst polymer LEDs had\u000a      efficiencies of a few percent. The research programme identified the\u000a      reasons for the limited efficiency &#8212; low photoluminescence quantum yield,\u000a      hole-dominated charge transport and losses to the formation of triplet\u000a      states. We then set about developing materials to overcome these problems.\u000a      Our focus, like much of the UK was on solution-processed materials i.e.\u000a      materials that can be deposited from solution &#8212; a simpler process than\u000a      evaporation in high vacuum. Although it was known that phosphorescence\u000a      could potentially increase the efficiency, there were not successful\u000a      examples of efficient solution-processed phosphorescent OLEDs.\u000a    We therefore explored whether dendrimers could address this challenge by\u000a      incorporating a phosphorescent chromophore into the core and using the\u000a      dendrons and surface groups to make it solution-processable. Accordingly\u000a      we developed the first phosphorescent light dendrimer OLED [R1], though\u000a      its efficiency was also low. Subsequently, we developed an iridium-cored\u000a      dendrimer which gave a dramatic leap in the external efficiency of devices\u000a      to 8% [R2]. This was a world record by a large margin for a\u000a      solution-processed LED.\u000a    The first Ir-cored dendrimer OLEDs were very efficient but we realised\u000a      the charge transport was dominated by holes, so that the efficiency could\u000a      be further improved by improving the charge balance. This was achieved by\u000a      introducing an electron-transporting layer and led to an outstanding\u000a      external quantum efficiency of 16% [R3] &#8212; three times higher than\u000a      light-emitting polymers at the time.\u000a    Subsequent light-emitting dendrimer research aimed at simplifying the\u000a      device structure by making \"host-free\" materials, and making a full range\u000a      of colours for displays [R4]. Hence we adjusted the core to give red light\u000a      emission [R5], and then worked on the very challenging problem of deep\u000a      blue phosphorescence. We made considerable progress at understanding\u000a      chromophore design for deep blue and then showed how this could give\u000a      efficient deep-blue phosphorescence [R6],\u000a    This research led to approximately 70 refereed journal papers on\u000a      light-emitting dendrimers, and a string of patent applications (more than\u000a      10) for efficient light-emitting dendrimers in the period 2000-2010.

The QCDOC project combined the use of then nascent\u000a      system-on-a-chip technology with a relatively slow but very low power\u000a      processor, and a large amount (4MB) of on- chip embedded DRAM. This\u000a      enabled us to integrate a six dimensional torus communications network, to\u000a      accelerate application performance with very high bandwidth memory, and to\u000a      optimise the overall system price, performance and power efficiency. We\u000a      therefore developed a machine with very good computational efficiency in\u000a      an early application of hardware-software co-design [R3, R4].\u000a    In December 2007 Boyle was invited to lead an international team\u000a      designing the memory prefetch engine for IBM's next generation BlueGene\/Q\u000a      architecture. This was a unique academic-industrial collaboration on core\u000a      IBM technology. The component designed by Boyle comprises 8% of the die\u000a      area and the project was the subject of a legal Collaboration Agreement\u000a      between University of Edinburgh, Columbia University and IBM, whereby\u000a      Boyle worked during the research and development phase as an external\u000a      contractor to IBM.\u000a    This has been a unique experiment in co-design at the cutting edge of\u000a      technology, using advanced QCD software and silicon design skills to feed\u000a      back and ensure best performance. Many architectural decisions have been\u000a      influenced by our QCD codes and by the academic design team members [R5,\u000a      R6].

Articles about bio-inspiration featuring quotes and\u000d\u000a      research from Vukusic reached 313,000 readers in Brazil and Argentina. A\u000d\u000a      Bausch &amp; Lomb video The World of Bio-inspiration, based on\u000d\u000a      Vukusic's presentations, has been viewed over 29,000 times [5.1].

In June 2010, Vukusic was invited\u000d\u000a      to a roundtable discussion [5.8], organised by Bausch &amp; Lomb, at the\u000d\u000a      annual meeting of the American Optometric Association where he gave a\u000d\u000a      presentation on bio-inspiration based on his research findings.\u000d\u000a      Illustrating the importance of the bio-inspiration message, one of the\u000d\u000a      participants, Dr Bruce Anderson, a fellow of the American Academy of\u000d\u000a      Optometry, observed: `When patients learn a product is bio-inspired, I\u000d\u000a      believe their confidence in the product increases. They realise there's\u000d\u000a      research behind it that makes it more compatible with the eye, and they're\u000d\u000a      more willing to try it and accept it.' The `highlights' website quotes `physicist\u000d\u000a        Peter Vukusic, PhD, who has done extensive work to bring bio-inspired\u000d\u000a        products to the market' [5.8].\u000d\u000a    Summarising the contribution of Vukusic's research to the commercial\u000d\u000a      success of Biotrue, the Director of Medical Affairs said:\u000d\u000a    `The launch of Biotrue has been unprecedented in the lens care\u000d\u000a        solution category. This is largely due to the excellent consulting\u000d\u000a        support and insightful guidance by Vukusic in leading us during the\u000d\u000a        development of the bio-inspiration positioning and our communications\u000d\u000a        plan.

Bio-inspired products have become a popular\u000d\u000a      marketing strategy for manufacturers to attract `conscientious consumers':\u000d\u000a      those who may be attracted to a particular product due to the perception\u000d\u000a      that naturally inspired designs are efficient, effective and `natural'.\u000d\u000a    Research led by Pete Vukusic, Professor in BioPhotonics (joined Exeter\u000d\u000a      1998) at the University of Exeter's School of Physics and Astronomy seeks\u000d\u000a      to understand the photonic properties of nanostructures in living systems\u000d\u000a      [3.1, 3.2], drawing on techniques from across the physical and biological\u000d\u000a      sciences. The aim is to discover and characterise photonic system designs\u000d\u000a      that exist in the natural world, which may inspire breakthrough\u000d\u000a      technological applications [3.3, 3.4, 3.5].\u000d\u000a    Vukusic's research group at Exeter has advanced a wider understanding of\u000d\u000a      photonics in biological systems. As an example, the study by Vukusic et\u000d\u000a       al. (2007) of a small Southeast Asian beetle revealed how its\u000d\u000a      brilliant whiteness is created by a material only five microns thick\u000d\u000a      [3.3]. This material is a highly disordered, filament-based photonic solid\u000d\u000a      that, through optimised spatial arrangement of its scattering centres, has\u000d\u000a      a quality of whiteness equivalent to commercial paper products upward of\u000d\u000a      50 times its thickness. The group is now collaborating with the paper\u000d\u000a      development division of French multinational Imerys Plc to design paper\u000d\u000a      formulations with less mineral coating making it lighter with consequently\u000d\u000a      lower product transport costs.\u000d\u000a    A 2004 paper by Vukusic analysed the nature of the black and unreflective\u000d\u000a      surfaces of arthropod wings [3.4]. It described the discovery and\u000d\u000a      characterisation of a significant structural component to the blackness of\u000d\u000a      some natural surfaces. These `black' structures are aperiodic, in complete\u000d\u000a      contrast to the structural periodicity causing vivid iridescent colour\u000d\u000a      that he identified and published in Nature a year earlier [3.1].\u000d\u000a      The aperiodicity strongly incoherently scatters light, increasing the\u000d\u000a      light's path-length through the absorbing pigmentation and thereby\u000d\u000a      enhancing the overall absorption cross-section of the system.\u000d\u000a    An investigation of several Papilio butterflies [3.5, 3.6] led to\u000d\u000a      the discovery that the bright wing colouration of this group results from\u000d\u000a      cooperation between highly fluorescent pigment, a 2D photonic crystal and\u000d\u000a      a highly tuned distributed Bragg reflector. (Previously, fluorescently\u000d\u000a      coloured systems and structurally coloured systems were characterised\u000d\u000a      separately in many different animal phyla; however, none had indicated an\u000d\u000a      interaction between the nanostructure and emission from the pigment.) This\u000d\u000a      work successfully demonstrated that the butterflies' wing colouration\u000d\u000a      exploits high efficiency fluorescence [3.6] from a 2D photonic crystal of\u000d\u000a      cuticle and air, the design of which prevents emission of light in two\u000d\u000a      dimensions but assists its emission in the third dimension (namely the\u000d\u000a      light is emitted upwards and out of the wing towards an observer). The\u000d\u000a      Bragg reflector located directly beneath the 2D photonic crystal ensures\u000d\u000a      both the reflection of non-absorbed photons of the correct colour and\u000d\u000a      upward-redirection of the downward-emitted fluorescence. High visibility\u000d\u000a      blue\/green light emission is achieved through the use of significantly\u000d\u000a      less fluorescent pigmentation than would otherwise be necessary if this\u000d\u000a      nanostructure arrangement did not exist. This is a well optimised and\u000d\u000a      adapted optical system, the light extraction mechanism of which is\u000d\u000a      analogous to that of the new range of ultra-high efficiency light emitting\u000d\u000a      diodes.\u000d\u000a    The study of these natural designs provided Vukusic with an extensive\u000d\u000a      understanding of how the power of bio-inspiration could be harnessed for\u000d\u000a      technology transfer, prompting an approach from one of the world's largest\u000d\u000a      suppliers of eye health products: Bausch &amp; Lomb.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37175","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"3355338","Name":"Namibia"},{"GeoNamesId":"933860","Name":"Botswana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Diamond modelling research at Exeter has made an impact in two principal\u000d\u000a      areas. It has provided De Beers with the scientific understanding it\u000d\u000a      needed to develop techniques to identify synthetic and treated diamonds,\u000d\u000a      maintaining consumer confidence in De Beers' diamond trading and, by way\u000d\u000a      of the company's long-established dominance, in the diamond industry as a\u000d\u000a      whole. Secondly, it was a factor in a decision by De Beers to invest &#163;20m\u000d\u000a      in strengthening its research base in the UK, creating high-level\u000d\u000a      employment for UK scientists [5.2].\u000d\u000a    The continued success of De Beers is crucial to the employment of\u000d\u000a      thousands of people around the world. The De Beers Group employs\u000d\u000a      approximately 20,000 people, of whom 17,000 are based in Africa. The\u000d\u000a      company has mining operations in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and\u000d\u000a      Canada and is part of the Anglo-American Group that has 145,000 employees\u000d\u000a      in 30 countries. De Beers sells approximately 40% of the world's rough\u000d\u000a      diamonds, thus supporting a huge number of downstream jobs in the diamond\u000d\u000a      trade, from polishing through grading to jewellery manufacture and\u000d\u000a      retailing. In 2011, De Beers had sales of $7.4 billion with earnings\u000d\u000a      before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $1.7\u000d\u000a      billion. According to the Head of Physics [5.2] at the De Beers Research\u000d\u000a      Centre in Maidenhead, a key factor in achieving such a strong performance\u000d\u000a      was the high consumer demand that drove price increases for rough and\u000d\u000a      polished diamonds. This, he says, \"was underpinned by work supporting\u000d\u000a      consumer confidence in diamonds in the face of rapid development over the\u000d\u000a      last 20 years of processes for production of synthetic diamond and\u000d\u000a      artificial treatment of natural diamond. It is vitally important for the\u000d\u000a      diamond trade that consumers can buy diamonds without fear of product\u000d\u000a      misrepresentation.\"\u000d\u000a    Referring specifically to Exeter's contribution, De Beers Head of Physics\u000d\u000a      said: \"Prof Jones's work since 1993 in modelling defects in diamond has\u000d\u000a      played a major role in helping us build the foundation of knowledge on\u000d\u000a      which our identification methodology is based and has been an important\u000d\u000a      factor in enabling the detection and containment of recent attempts to\u000d\u000a      sell synthetic or treated diamond fraudulently as natural untreated\u000d\u000a      diamond.\"\u000d\u000a    Jones's research, supported by two collaborative awards in science and\u000d\u000a      engineering (CASE) PhD studentships funded jointly by EPSRC and De Beers\u000d\u000a      [5.3, 5.4], helped the company to develop and test the idea that vacancy\u000d\u000a      clusters are responsible for brown colouration in natural diamonds with\u000d\u000a      low nitrogen content. It enabled De Beers to understand the mechanism by\u000d\u000a      which the brown colour is removed by relatively short high temperature\u000d\u000a      heat treatments, and the identity and stability of by-products of this\u000d\u000a      heat treatment. The work also helped unravel the link between\u000d\u000a      nitrogen-vacancy-hydrogen defects and their optical signatures. These\u000d\u000a      defects have not been detected in any natural diamond but tend to be\u000d\u000a      present in synthetic diamond, changing its colour. Prof Jones' work helped\u000d\u000a      De Beers understand these phenomena. De Beers Head of Physics concludes:\u000d\u000a      \"[Exeter's research] has therefore been of fundamental importance in the\u000d\u000a      development of a robust identification methodology that has safeguarded\u000d\u000a      consumer confidence and therefore many jobs in the diamond industry.\"\u000d\u000a    De Beers cannot quantify the impact of Exeter's work in economic terms;\u000d\u000a      to remain one step ahead of counterfeiters, the company discloses very\u000d\u000a      little information about the methods they use to characterise diamonds.\u000d\u000a      But further evidence that Jones's research has informed practice at De\u000d\u000a      Beers comes in journal articles published by De Beers scientists [5.5,\u000d\u000a      5.6, 5.7], which reference the work. It is also highlighted by De Beers'\u000d\u000a      decision, on the basis of Jones's results, to award two further CASE\u000d\u000a      studentships in 2009 to academics at the University of Manchester, and to\u000d\u000a      support further experiments at Helsinki University of Technology.

However,\u000d\u000a      the last two decades have seen a rapid development in the production of\u000d\u000a      synthetic diamond and the artificial enhancement of colour of natural\u000d\u000a      diamond. The increasing quality of counterfeit natural diamonds represents\u000d\u000a      a serious threat to consumer confidence. Bain &amp; Company reported that\u000d\u000a      2011 marked the appearance of a large batch of synthetic diamonds believed\u000d\u000a      by their dealer to be natural, highlighting the need for better techniques\u000d\u000a      to guarantee the authenticity of natural diamonds and preserve trust in\u000d\u000a      the industry.\u000d\u000a    Research by Robert Jones, Emeritus Professor (at Exeter since 1971) in\u000d\u000a      Physics has developed new methods to understand colour caused by defects\u000d\u000a      in diamonds and to distinguish between natural and artificial or\u000d\u000a      heat-treated diamonds. The new methods are based on prior studies by Jones\u000d\u000a      into the defects that exist in a wide range of materials. A computer code\u000d\u000a      &#8212; AIMPRO (Abinitio Modelling Program) &#8212; that calculates, among other\u000d\u000a      things, the optical properties of materials was first developed by Jones\u000d\u000a      [3.1] and now has an international community of users. It analyses the\u000d\u000a      structural, electrical, optical and mechanical properties of solids in\u000d\u000a      order to identify material defects. It is unusual in that it uses Gaussian\u000d\u000a      functions (similar to a normal distribution bell curve) to represent the\u000d\u000a      quantum-mechanical wavefunctions, and hence the electron density within a\u000d\u000a      solid, rather than the more commonly used plane waves. Fewer Gaussian\u000d\u000a      functions than plane waves are needed per atom meaning that larger unit\u000d\u000a      cells can be investigated.\u000d\u000a    Jones used AIMPRO to model complex defects in Gallium Nitride and Silicon\u000d\u000a      [3.2, 3.3]. The code works by arranging atoms in a structure. If the atoms\u000d\u000a      are aligned incorrectly, the code calculates the force between the atoms\u000d\u000a      and rearranges the structure until equilibrium is reached. Then the\u000d\u000a      optical properties and other properties such as the electron energy loss\u000d\u000a      spectra (EELS) are calculated.\u000d\u000a    At the request of the Diamond Trading Company (DTC), the rough diamond\u000d\u000a      distribution arm of De Beers, Jones used AIMPRO to determine the optical\u000d\u000a      properties and EELS signature of various defects in the diamond. Three\u000d\u000a      types of defect exist in natural diamond: vacancies and interstitials\u000d\u000a      (where an atom is either missing from or added to an otherwise regular\u000d\u000a      structure), impurities (which replace carbon atoms in the lattice), and\u000d\u000a      dislocations (where neighbouring planes of atoms have slipped in relation\u000d\u000a      to each other). Jones began by calculating the energy spectrum of the most\u000d\u000a      stable dislocation that is found in all types of diamond. He showed that\u000d\u000a      the dislocation itself is not responsible for the colour of brown diamonds\u000d\u000a      &#8212; the most common colour variety of natural diamonds. Instead he proved\u000d\u000a      that it is the vacancy clusters that can give rise to the brown colour and\u000d\u000a      he argued that such clusters are introduced by movement of dislocations\u000d\u000a      when a diamond is plastically deformed under heat and pressure [3.4]. The\u000d\u000a      vacancy clusters and therefore the brown colour can be removed by exposure\u000d\u000a      to 2000&#176;C heat. Crucially, Jones discovered that this causes the vacancy\u000d\u000a      clusters to decay into other types of defect, such as nitrogen-vacancy\u000d\u000a      defects, the optical properties of which are well known. Counterfeiters\u000d\u000a      are not yet able to remove these new defects, which show up through\u000d\u000a      optical spectroscopy used by companies like De Beers to validate their\u000d\u000a      natural diamonds.\u000d\u000a    Further studies considered the optical properties of a number of other\u000d\u000a      defects such as silicon and nitrogen vacancies, all of which are present\u000d\u000a      in treated diamond and cause colour changes. More recent work has dealt\u000d\u000a      with the properties of graphene and related doping mechanisms [3.5],\u000d\u000a      [3.6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37176","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research into electromagnetic and acoustic materials at the University of\u000d\u000a      Exeter has driven major scientific innovations within QinetiQ.

VTRAM, patented in 2004, is\u000d\u000a      believed to be the world's thinnest practical RF absorber. Recognising the\u000d\u000a      commercial opportunities, QinetiQ turned its attention to using VTRAM in\u000d\u000a      RFID tag technology. RFID tags are used for automatic identification and\u000d\u000a      tracking, for example to locate pharmaceuticals in warehouses. However,\u000d\u000a      the signal from standard RFID tags cannot be read if the tags are in close\u000d\u000a      proximity to metals and liquids. QinetiQ found that a modified version of\u000d\u000a      VTRAM could be used to design new tags that were shielded from the metal\u000d\u000a      or liquid, thus RFID tags could be used on any metallic or water-filled\u000d\u000a      container. This offered a solution to companies like WalMart who wished to\u000d\u000a      RFID tag all their goods. QinetiQ developed a portfolio of patents and\u000d\u000a      created the spin-out company Omni-ID in March 2007 [5.6]. The company was\u000d\u000a      founded on the technology originally developed at Exeter with James Brown,\u000d\u000a      who completed his PhD under Sambles in 2010 and was technical director\u000d\u000a      from 2007 to 2012.\u000d\u000a    Omni-ID grew rapidly, from an initial offering of 3 products to a\u000d\u000a      portfolio in excess of 20 products. In 2009 it received $15m in funding\u000d\u000a      from investors on the back of strong initial market demand for its RFID\u000d\u000a      tags. It secured another $8m in September 2011 to finance expansion. In\u000d\u000a      2012, it won `Best in Show' [5.7] at the RFID Journal Awards for its\u000d\u000a      Visual Tag System, which provides workers with real-time information and\u000d\u000a      instructions regarding moving assets. Its high-frequency RFID tag\u000d\u000a      technology is being used by the US Government, IBM and Bank of America for\u000d\u000a      cheaper and more efficient IT asset management; by BP, Shell Oil and\u000d\u000a      Petrobas to increase the traceability of assets through the oil production\u000d\u000a      process; by BHP Billiton and Holt Cat for tool inventory; and by GE\u000d\u000a      Healthcare and Johnson &amp; Johnson for safe monitoring of\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals [5.8].

These `metamaterials'\u000d\u000a      are also creating new solutions in the high-growth markets of Radio\u000d\u000a      Frequency Identification (RFID) and anti-counterfeiting measures. About 5%\u000d\u000a      of world trade is now in counterfeit goods, and unfortunately this booming\u000d\u000a      industry is now moving from innocuous items like shoes and handbags to\u000d\u000a      fake medicine and pesticides. By controlling electromagnetic radiation, it\u000d\u000a      is possible to make performance improvements to RFID tags that make items\u000d\u000a      easier to track and locate, and to help prevent theft and forgery.\u000d\u000a    Since 1997, the Electromagnetic and Acoustic Materials group at Exeter's\u000d\u000a      School of Physics and Astronomy has forged a strong research partnership\u000d\u000a      with the Smart Materials &amp; Technologies (SMT) team at leading defence\u000d\u000a      multinational QinetiQ. The main thrust of the collaborative research has\u000d\u000a      been the investigation of structures that can tailor electromagnetic\u000d\u000a      radiation to specific requirements. Led by Roy Sambles, Professor of\u000d\u000a      Experimental Physics (1991-), and Professor Peter Vukusic (1998-) this\u000d\u000a      research began with a MoD Research Fellowship in 1998 that funded a\u000d\u000a      collaborative study of the structural colouration of butterflies [3.1,\u000d\u000a      3.2]. By understanding how butterfly wings create a myriad of visual\u000d\u000a      effects (e.g. vivid colours) through subtle changes in the size, shape or\u000d\u000a      structure of fine scales on their surface, the team could apply these\u000d\u000a      principles to control infrared, microwave or radio wave radiation.\u000d\u000a    Further research provided a comprehensive understanding of the underlying\u000d\u000a      optical effects caused by multi-layered structures within butterfly wings.\u000d\u000a      This inspired a patented technology that could be used to create much\u000d\u000a      clearer optical signatures within credit cards and banknotes to counter\u000d\u000a      forgery [3.3]. In addition, it prompted our researchers to investigate\u000d\u000a      whether structures based on butterfly wings could be metallised and scaled\u000d\u000a      up to operate at longer wavelengths in the RF domain. This further\u000d\u000a      prompted other thinking, for example, in the context of stealth\u000d\u000a      technologies, could the principles be applied to render a military vehicle\u000d\u000a      undetectable to radar?\u000d\u000a    The Exeter team embarked on new research at microwave frequencies,\u000d\u000a      following the finding by Thomas Ebbesen that it is possible, to transmit\u000d\u000a      light efficiently through opaque metal films perforated by arrays of\u000d\u000a      subwavelength holes via surface plasmons. Sambles and Alastair Hibbins\u000d\u000a      (Associate Professor) created `designer' surface plasmons at microwave\u000d\u000a      frequencies [3.4]. The key discovery came in 2004 [3.5] when the Exeter\u000d\u000a      team modelled the electromagnetic response of ultra-thin metal-clad\u000d\u000a      wave-guiding structures, formed by simply removing metal from the\u000d\u000a      cladding, giving a periodic array of sub-wavelength slits. The devices\u000d\u000a      were found to absorb or transmit radiation of wavelengths some 100 times\u000d\u000a      greater than their thickness, and compress millimetre waves into microns.\u000d\u000a      This breakthrough drove fresh work at QinetiQ to prevent RF leakage\u000d\u000a      through small gaps such as joints in airframes and gave QinetiQ\u000d\u000a      researchers the opportunity to explore new ways to capture and safely\u000d\u000a      redirect RF signals, rather than simply absorbing them in lossy materials\u000d\u000a      [3.6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37177","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In recent years, the uptake of physics at A-level has experienced a\u000a      resurgence. From a low of 27,368 in 2006, the number of A-level entries\u000a      climbed to 32,860 in 2011. Figures from UCAS revealed an approximately\u000a      2,000 increase in students applying for physics courses at UK universities\u000a      between 2011 and 2012. This 8.3% rise is at odds with an overall 8.7%\u000a      decline in university applicants across the UK. While it is impossible to\u000a      measure the individual contribution of Vukusic's public engagement\u000a      campaigns &#8212; based wholly on 15 years of his research into natural\u000a      photonics &#8212; to this popularity upswing, his outreach activities have\u000a      formed a significant part of the UK physics community's wider successful\u000a      efforts to capture the public imagination, which in turn has extended the\u000a      reach of Vukusic's activities to Ireland and Africa.\u000a    Building on the schools tour in 2007, Vukusic initiated subsequent tours\u000a      of the Light Fantastic: The Science of Colour lectures for young\u000a      people [5.1]: between 2008 and 2013 he gave 160 presentations (the\u000a      majority in the UK) to primary and secondary schools. The lectures set out\u000a      to elucidate the science behind light and colour to stimulate students'\u000a      curiosity beyond the classroom, and were designed to complement the\u000a      National Curriculum and its Scottish and Irish equivalents. The lectures\u000a      featured the electromagnetic spectrum, how colour is produced when light\u000a      interacts with structures, how structural colour is produced and used in\u000a      nature, and how examples of natural structural colour are\u000a      influencing new technology and products, from cosmetics to fashion.\u000a    The impact of the 2007 tour continued throughout the REF period. The IOP\u000a      filmed Vukusic's original lecture and distributed 5,000 free DVDs to\u000a      IOP-member schools. In January 2012, it was uploaded to YouTube [5.2] and\u000a      has been viewed over 17,000 times so far. The majority of viewers are from\u000a      the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and India. The video was uploaded as a\u000a      teaching resource on the TES UK and India websites in 2012 and 2013, where\u000a      it is freely available for 2.5m registered online users in 274 countries.\u000a    Demonstrating the success of the lectures, Vukusic was awarded the\u000a      British Association of Science Lord Kelvin Prize for science lecturing in\u000a      2008. He received repeat invitations from many schools, for example a\u000a      lecture at Rugby School in January 2013 led to a request for him to return\u000a      in June for the 25th anniversary of the IOP teachers' meeting. Following\u000a      one lecture at The Westgate School in Slough, the Deputy Head wrote that\u000a      Vukusic's talk had \"completely changed a number of students' (many of whom\u000a      had previously failed the 11+) feelings towards pursuing their studies at\u000a      university level.\" [5.3].\u000a    In 2011, Vukusic, again funded by the IOP, took the lecture series to\u000a      Ireland [5.4] where he reached more than 4,500 schoolchildren and 50\u000a      teachers through 11 lectures that tied in with the school curriculum. The\u000a      tour was organised in response to declining numbers of Irish\u000a      schoolchildren taking physics at Leaving Certificate level. Writing in the\u000a      Irish Times in 2012, the Chair of the IOP in Ireland said that a quarter\u000a      of schools were not offering the subject at Leaving Certificate level.\u000a    In May 2012, the IOP provided `in kind' (stationery, textbooks, DVDs) and\u000a      logistical support to enable Vukusic to take his lecture series to Africa.\u000a      This contributed to the IOP's international programme, which seeks to\u000a      advance physics in the developing world for economic and social benefit.\u000a      Vukusic arranged lectures at five schools in the poorest parts of the\u000a      Ethiopian capital Addis-Adaba, reaching more than 1100 students and 15\u000a      teachers [5.5, 5.6]. The Director of the Addis-Ababa Education Bureau\u000a      said: `...surprisingly enough, social science students who took part\u000a        in your public lecture have insisted to be members of the science and\u000a        technology club to whom we have accepted their appeal [5.6].\"\u000a      Vukusic took the lecture tour to Tanzania and on to Malawi, where he\u000a      visited eight rural schools over four days, reaching 1,500 pupils and 55\u000a      teachers. This trip was part-funded by Ripple Africa, a charity that works\u000a      to improve quality of education. The charity's programme lead said Vukusic\u000a      was \"an inspiration\" to the students, commenting that the lectures\u000a      complemented the Malawian science syllabus. He asked Vukusic to return\u000a      every year [5.7].\u000a    Vukusic's lectures have also engaged adult audiences. He exhibited his\u000a      photonics research at the Royal Society Summer Exhibition in 2011 and,\u000a      since 2008, has given talks at five major science festivals, including a\u000a      Royal Society event in Tokyo in 2008 and the Dublin Science Festival in\u000a      2009.

However in recent years the supply of highly skilled physics\u000a      graduates to support innovation in the sector has come under pressure.\u000a      Declining popularity of physics among A-level students was highlighted in\u000a      2006 when research revealed that A-level entries fell from 55,728 in 1982\u000a      to 27,368 in 2006.\u000a    It was against this backdrop that Professor Pete Vukusic (joined Exeter\u000a      in 1998) was co-leading research into natural photonics at the University\u000a      of Exeter, following a career as a secondary school science teacher.\u000a      Working closely with Roy Sambles, Professor of Experimental Physics, he\u000a      investigated the mechanisms by which some of the brightest and most vivid\u000a      iridescent colours in nature are produced as a result of the interaction\u000a      of light with micro- and nano-scale periodic structured surfaces [3.1 - 3.6].\u000a\u0009  These structures occur in the wings of butterflies, hummingbirds and\u000a      a diversity of animals, where a combination of multilayer interference and\u000a      optical gratings gives rise to a broad array of colour appearances through\u000a      ultra-high reflectance, coherent scattering and (often) narrow-band\u000a      spectral purity. Vukusic's analyses of many `living jewel' systems, many\u000a      published in Nature and Science journals, revealed how\u000a      often unusual periodic and quasi-periodic microstructure can produce\u000a      bright iridescence [3.1 - 3.6]. A Science paper in 2005 showed how\u000a      the naturally evolved light extraction system on the wing scales of a Papilio\u000a      butterfly could be applied to the development of a high efficiency LED\u000a      [3.2]. A later paper in Science, in 2007 [3.3], elaborated on how\u000a      photonic structures within beetle elytra are providing inspiration for\u000a      innovative technological applications.\u000a    There are a wealth of complex biological structural designs and optical\u000a      effects that mirror many technological photonic system designs. The\u000a      physics and morphology of these structures are well understood [3.4];\u000a      however, how to replicate these optical structures for commercial use,\u000a      such as in cosmetics and anti-counterfeiting technologies, is less clear.\u000a      Because of this, more recently Vukusic's research has focussed on\u000a      mimicking and fabricating bio-inspired structures using a combination of\u000a      layer deposition techniques, including colloidal self-assembly, sol-gel\u000a      techniques, sputtering and atomic layer deposition [3.5]. Vukusic has\u000a      applied his understanding of natural photonics to the development of a\u000a      range of technologies. In 2013 [3.6], he published a paper announcing the\u000a      invention of a new fibre that changes colour when stretched. The design\u000a      principles were based on the replication of the unique structural elements\u000a      that create the bright iridescent blue colour of a tropical plant's fruit.\u000a    This body of research, through its exploration of colour and light, was a\u000a      natural fit for a public engagement campaign aimed at stimulating interest\u000a      in physics among children and young adults. In 2007, Vukusic was selected\u000a      by the IOP to give its funded series of schools lectures. He delivered Light\u000a        Fantastic: The Science of Colour in an effort to educate and enthuse\u000a      students with the wonders of light and colour, based entirely on his\u000a      research activity. In 2007, 85 IOP-sponsored lectures at 55 venues across\u000a      the UK were delivered to audiences of 14-16 year olds, with Vukusic\u000a      drawing on his experience both as a natural photonics research scientist\u000a      and a schoolteacher to deliver a series of dynamic outreach lectures,\u000a      demonstrations and workshops.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37178","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Researchers trained at Exeter and supervised by Sambles in the\u000a      fundamental physics of liquid crystal devices developed with others the\u000a      novel technology and knowledge transfer essential to the creation of a\u000a      spinout company. This company has gone on to establish a dominant share of\u000a      what is set to become a multi-billion-pound global market in electronic\u000a      labelling for retailers. In the words of ZBD Founder and Director of\u000a      Technology [5.1] \"On so many levels from: specific knowledge of grating\u000a      alignment of liquid crystals, general liquid crystal fabrication\u000a      techniques; access to theoretical modelling; to learning how to solve\u000a      problems as a team; I've benefitted from my time at Exeter and DERA and\u000a      ZBD have benefitted from my training.\"\u000a    Jones, Bryan-Brown and Wood raised &#163;1.5m in Venture Capital funding to\u000a      create DERA's first ever spinout company ZBD Displays Ltd in 2000. The\u000a      company has since grown to employ nearly 60 people, based mainly in the\u000a      UK, but also in offices in the United States, France, Germany and Hong\u000a      Kong. Twenty of the 60-strong staff are scientists and engineers, seven of\u000a      whom are at PhD level. It is an indication of the influence of Exeter's\u000a      research expertise that four of those seven PhD students completed their\u000a      degrees under the supervision of Sambles and Barnes at Exeter, in addition\u000a      to the fact that Bryan-Brown and Wood began their liquid crystal grating\u000a      studies at Exeter.\u000a    ZBD was founded to exploit the invention by Bryan-Brown, Brown and Jones\u000a      of the Zenithal Bistable Device, which is based on the alignment of liquid\u000a      crystals on gratings. The technology enabled the creation of a new type of\u000a      low-power LCD. The image it generates remains on the display even when the\u000a      power is switched off, meaning it operates at a fraction of the cost of\u000a      traditional (TFT) LCD displays and is more environmentally friendly.\u000a      Supermarkets use it for displaying pricing and product information instead\u000a      of printed labels, as it can be updated instantly, and it is applicable to\u000a      anything that has a display and is battery-powered, such as an mp3 player\u000a      or e-tablet. The technology enables organisations to update hundreds of\u000a      e-paper displays from a central source, ensuring that pricing and other\u000a      information is accurate and consistent, while saving on consumables and\u000a      the time and effort required to replace paper labels.\u000a    ZBD is now the world's leading provider of fully graphic e-paper display\u000a      systems for retailers. As a result of underpinning research into grating\u000a      alignment of liquid crystals, the company possesses what it describes as\u000a      \"an extensive intellectual property portfolio and unparalleled expertise\u000a      in LCD design and manufacture\". Growth has been rapid. ZBD has raised over\u000a      &#163;50m of venture funding and, since launching shelf-edge label products in\u000a      2008, has sold several million displays across Europe [5.2, 5.3, 5.4]. In\u000a      2012, it reported for the previous financial year [5.2]:\u000a    - Revenue growth to $19.6m (&#163;12.6m) from $6.4m (&#163;4.1m), maintaining an\u000a      annual growth rate of 200% since commercialisation began in 2008;\u000a    - A presence in 15 retail sectors in 24 countries and at least 50% of the\u000a      world's leading retailers engaged with, or in discussions with, ZBD;\u000a    - Growth in retail clients from 52 to 130 with e-paper for retail the\u000a      primary revenue driver;\u000a    - Growth in non-retail customer numbers from seven to 40 across eight\u000a      sectors.\u000a    In 2012, ZBD reached the number one spot in the Deloitte Technology Fast\u000a      50 [5.3], a ranking of the 50 fastest-growing technology companies in the\u000a      UK. Rankings are based on percentage revenue growth over five years. ZBD's\u000a      revenues grew 17,910% during this period. In the same year, ZBD ranked fifth\u000a      in the Sunday Times' Tech Track 100 league table [5.4, 5.5]. Also in 2012,\u000a      ZBD won an Innovation Award from the Institute of Physics [5.6] for its\u000a      unique e-paper display technology. ZBD's Chief Technical Officer Cliff\u000a      Jones said that the award was \"testament to ZBD's focus on applying new\u000a      physics to our unique bistable e-paper technology\" [5.7].\u000a    The company continues to develop novel displays based upon liquid crystal\u000a      grating structures, and maintains a world-leading expertise in liquid\u000a      crystal alignment that derives directly from its roots in the Exeter\u000a      group. Its CEO believes its investment in R&amp;D (around 50% of its\u000a      funding) is a principal reason behind the company's success in 2009 when\u000a      it invested over &#163;3m. The impact of Exeter's research training can be\u000a      traced, through ZBD's success, to the benefits experienced by ZBD's key\u000a      customers. Coop Denmark, a Danish retail giant with revenues of $9.2bn,\u000a      has introduced ZBD's electronic shelf labelling to more than 100 of its\u000a      stores because it \"can use it to make our operations more efficient,\u000a      launch promotions more effectively and differentiate our stores from our\u000a      competitors\" [5.8]. UK baby specialist Kiddicare has committed to using\u000a      the labelling in ten new superstores scheduled to open in 2013. Norwegian\u000a      discount retail chain Bunnpris is using ZBD's technology in its 200 stores\u000a      [5.9], as are Italian supermarket giant SISA [5.9], T-Mobile Austria,\u000a      Estonia's leading telecoms provider EMT, U.S. electronics retailer Vann's\u000a      and Dutch electrical retailer Plasmadiscounter [5.9]. In September 2012,\u000a      ZBD opened a new HQ in Paris [5.10].\u000a    To fully deploy e-paper displays across all products in all retailers\u000a      amounts to a global market size of $100B. While this is large investment\u000a      it is still much smaller than the annual efficiency savings that can be\u000a      made by retailers by avoiding waste, avoiding lost sales as well as fully\u000a      utilising their active pricing systems. While paper signage has acted as a\u000a      bottleneck to fully implementing retail IT, electronic signage now finally\u000a      unlocks a fully integrated system.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Researchers, and the work they undertook at the University of Exeter\u000a      during the 1990s, led to the formation of the Defence Evaluation and\u000a      Research Agency's (now QinetiQ) first spinout company: ZBD Displays Ltd.\u000a      Achieving revenue growth of 17,910% over the last five years, ZBD's unique\u000a      electronic retail signage and shelf-edge labelling technology is used by\u000a      major retailers all over the world.

Understanding the fundamental physics behind the operation of\u000a      the liquid crystals within these devices is essential for the development\u000a      of the next generation of devices. Many liquid crystals are composed of\u000a      rod-shaped molecules that align roughly parallel to each other. Dictating\u000a      their alignment by applying a voltage across a thin layer of the liquid\u000a      crystal material allows the amount of light transmitted through them to be\u000a      controlled. To advance the technology further and meet the huge market\u000a      demand for lower-power LCDs, further developments in understanding the\u000a      alignment of the liquid crystal layer are needed.\u000a    Since 1986, research at the University of Exeter's School of Physics and\u000a      Astronomy, led by Roy Sambles, Professor of Experimental Physics (since\u000a      1991), has sought to investigate new optical techniques to characterise\u000a      the alignment properties of a range of liquid crystals. This work was\u000a      developed by Dr Guy Bryan-Brown, (PhD 1988-91) under Sambles' supervision,\u000a      to incorporate optical gratings into the system. This was extended by Dr\u000a      Emma Wood, (PhD 1989-92) again supervised by Sambles, who studied the\u000a      geometry of grating coupling to optical modes in a thin,\u000a      voltage-controllable liquid crystal layer [3.1] and how this might be\u000a      employed in LCD technology.\u000a    In 1990, the Exeter group constructed a mini-interferometer for the\u000a      fabrication of gratings and devised ways to optically characterise liquid\u000a      crystal cells containing such gratings. With Sambles acting as a\u000a      consultant to the LCD group at DERA (then RSRE) led by Dr Cliff Jones,\u000a      (Display Group Technical Leader), further collaborative work on grating\u000a      alignment in nematic liquid crystal devices ensued with Jones's team\u000a      working closely with Sambles' group at Exeter.\u000a    After joining DERA, Bryan-Brown continued work on gratings and liquid\u000a      crystals, establishing a capability for fabrication and assessment of the\u000a      grating structures derived directly from the techniques pioneered at\u000a      Exeter. He and Sambles co-authored early papers [3.2, 3.3] in this area.\u000a      Between 1994 and 1996 Bryan-Brown was the industrial supervisor for Wood,\u000a      a post-doctoral fellow in Sambles' research group who continued working on\u000a      grating aligned liquid crystals to augment the work being done within\u000a      DERA. With EPSRC and MOD funding [3.4, 3.5], Wood and others went on to\u000a      explore the azimuthal anchoring energies in a range of diffraction grating\u000a      structures [3.6]. Exeter also developed rigorous theoretical models used\u000a      to deduce the configuration of the liquid crystal close to the grating\u000a      surface [3.7]. DERA filed a number of primary patents centred on aligning\u000a      liquid crystals with gratings, the most important of which was the\u000a      Zenithal Bistable Device (ZBD) [3.8]. This device broke new ground as it\u000a      resulted in two optically distinct stable states at zero power, one\u000a      appearing dark under crossed polarisers, and the other, light. Power is\u000a      only required to switch between these states.\u000a    In 1996, Wood moved to DERA and a total of 11 patents were filed, with\u000a      parallel ongoing research by Sambles at Exeter into various types of\u000a      grating-aligned liquid crystals [3.9, 3.10].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38361","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    ROSA (Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere):\u000d\u000a      The detectors in our SuperWASP and ROSA instruments were developed in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Andor Technology plc, one of the world leaders in detector technology,\u000d\u000a      which employs over 300\u000d\u000a      people in 16 offices worldwide, and distributes its products to 10,000\u000d\u000a      customers in 55 countries.\u000d\u000a      Our successful partnership with Andor allowed them to identify large\u000d\u000a      format CCD and high-speed\u000d\u000a      ultra-sensitive EMCCD scientific cameras as a growing market for\u000d\u000a      astronomical applications, as\u000d\u000a      they were unaware of the increasing importance of high cadence observing\u000d\u000a      in astrophysics\u000d\u000a      research. In addition, the partnership allowed Andor to become involved in\u000d\u000a      the European Solar\u000d\u000a      Telescope (EST) Consortium, and provided access to EU\/FP7 funding for\u000d\u000a      Andor of &#8364;81K (2008 - 2011)\u000d\u000a      for a preliminary detector Design Study for the EST. This in turn has\u000d\u000a      potential applications to\u000d\u000a      other solar telescope designs around the globe, such as the Advanced\u000d\u000a      Technology Solar\u000d\u000a      Telescope (ATST) in the USA and the National Large Solar Telescope (NLST)\u000d\u000a      in India. Most\u000d\u000a      importantly, the drive for science excellence in our programmes pushed\u000d\u000a      existing detector\u000d\u000a      technology to its limits, and was directly responsible for Andor's\u000d\u000a      development of these large format,\u000d\u000a      low noise, high-speed cameras. Andor has now been identified (by the EST\u000d\u000a      and ATST Consortia)\u000d\u000a      as one of only two companies worldwide which have the capability to\u000d\u000a      provide cameras that can\u000d\u000a      meet the stringent science requirements of the next generation of solar\u000d\u000a      telescopes (i.e. large\u000d\u000a      format, synchronised and fast readout).\u000d\u000a    For ROSA to operate successfully, it has been necessary to solve the\u000d\u000a      problem of accurately\u000d\u000a      synchronising up to 6 cameras at high cadence, so that all images are\u000d\u000a      obtained at exactly the\u000d\u000a      same time with an accuracy of a few microseconds. Andor worked with\u000d\u000a      Mathioudakis and Keenan\u000d\u000a      to develop the synchronisation hardware and software infrastructure to\u000d\u000a      achieve this. Following its\u000d\u000a      successful development, this directly expanded Andor's understanding of\u000d\u000a      high bandwidth data\u000d\u000a      handling and multi-camera synchronisation, identified as a key future area\u000d\u000a      in terms of providing\u000d\u000a      `added-value' to camera systems. In particular, high bandwidth solutions\u000d\u000a      are highly complementary\u000d\u000a      to next-generation scientific CMOS technology, an area of innovation that\u000d\u000a      is presently being\u000d\u000a      spearheaded by Andor. This new ground-breaking technology offers the\u000d\u000a      ability to acquire large\u000d\u000a      format data at very fast frame rates with extremely high sensitivity and\u000d\u000a      is already resonating with a\u000d\u000a      broad diversity of scientific applications, including in biophysics (e.g.\u000d\u000a      investigating\u000d\u000a      neurotransmission at individual synapses in brain tissue), drug discovery\u000d\u000a      (e.g. imaging biological\u000d\u000a      reactions such as drug binding) and high-cadence astronomy (including\u000d\u000a      solar physics).\u000d\u000a    Our partnership with Andor has directly led to the development of imaging\u000d\u000a      products\u000d\u000a      comprising o f camera (or multi-camera) systems combined with high\u000d\u000a      bandwidth data handling\u000d\u000a      and real-time processing units. The sales of these products generated over\u000d\u000a      &#163;1.4M in 2012,\u000d\u000a      and is estimated by Andor to grow to more than 300 systems per year in the\u000d\u000a      next 5 years,\u000d\u000a      corresponding to a revenue of &#163;3.8M per year. This has also helped Andor\u000d\u000a      to maintain a leading\u000d\u000a      position in the scientific camera market on a global scale, particularly\u000d\u000a      in the consistently growing\u000d\u000a      and relatively well-funded area of astronomy.\u000d\u000a    Super-WASP and the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS):\u000d\u000a      We have collaborated with ANDOR on the development of large format,\u000d\u000a      deep-depleted CCDs\u000d\u000a      needed for the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) project. Although\u000d\u000a      NGTS will use large-format\u000d\u000a      deep depleted CCDs from e2v Technology, (Chelmsford), it is the Andor low\u000d\u000a      noise camera\u000d\u000a      architecture and deep cooling technology that makes these devices usable.\u000d\u000a      Building on the\u000d\u000a      heritage of the SuperWASP project, we conducted a prototype experiment on\u000d\u000a      La Palma\u000d\u000a      (November 2009 &#8212; March 2010) using Andor's 1K x 1K iKon-M 934N BR-DD\u000d\u000a      deep-depleted CCD.\u000d\u000a      This experiment proved the viability of high-precision photometry with\u000d\u000a      such technology. Our results\u000d\u000a      led directly to the development of a new camera product (the larger format\u000d\u000a      2K x 2K iKon-L 936\u000d\u000a      deep-depleted CCD) by e2v-Andor-QUB for NGTS. As the largest format,\u000d\u000a      deep-depleted cameras\u000d\u000a      that only need thermoelectric cooling rather than bulky and expensive\u000d\u000a      cryogenics, this is a major\u000d\u000a      advance in professional imaging systems. These devices have now become\u000d\u000a      part of the Andor\u000d\u000a      product portfolio. Andor Technology is currently the sole company\u000d\u000a      marketing these devices, and\u000d\u000a      sales have amounted to greater than &#163;500K in only 18 months since the\u000d\u000a      product came into the\u000d\u000a      market.\u000d\u000a    We note that our case study clearly provides impact as defined in Annex C\u000d\u000a      of the Guidance on\u000d\u000a      Submissions, namely under paragraph 5 &#8212; change or benefit to the\u000d\u000a        activities, performance, policy\u000d\u000a        and process of an organisation. Specifically, our partnership with\u000d\u000a      Andor led to the decision to\u000d\u000a      develop new imaging systems and the resultant revenue from these.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    As standard commercially-available imaging systems were unable to deliver\u000d\u000a      the performance\u000d\u000a      necessary for our astronomy research programmes, we formed a partnership\u000d\u000a      with Andor\u000d\u000a      Technology to develop two new specifically-tailored novel imaging systems:\u000d\u000a      one to allow high-speed,\u000d\u000a      high cadence imaging over an array of detectors whose capture times were\u000d\u000a      precisely\u000d\u000a      synchronised (for solar research); one to combine large format CCD\u000d\u000a      detectors with a\u000d\u000a      thermoelectric deep cooling design, removing the need for a separate,\u000d\u000a      expensive cooling system\u000d\u000a      (for exoplanet research).

Many solar research\u000d\u000a      topics involve the observation of phenomena over small sizes (few tens of\u000d\u000a      km) and short\u000d\u000a      timescales (one second or less), in particular those related to the\u000d\u000a      variable Sun and its influence on\u000d\u000a      the Earth. Solar flares and other events can seriously affect satellite\u000d\u000a      communications, GPS\u000d\u000a      systems and power grids, the most famous example being the blackout in\u000d\u000a      Quebec in 1989, which\u000d\u000a      cost the Hydro-Quebec power company alone over $10M.\u000d\u000a    In the mid-2000's, Profs Mathioudakis, Keenan and collaborators realised\u000d\u000a      the need for the\u000d\u000a      development of specialist equipment to allow progress in the understanding\u000d\u000a      of solar phenomena at\u000d\u000a      a much greater level of detail than previously achieved [1, 2].

In particular, the Rapid\u000d\u000a      Oscillations in the Solar\u000d\u000a      Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument provides images of the solar atmosphere\u000d\u000a      simultaneously at 6\u000d\u000a      wavelengths, at a rate of up to 200 images per second per wavelength, with\u000d\u000a      a resolution of better\u000d\u000a      than 100 km [3]. ROSA was part-funded by a PPARC grant for &#163;246K awarded\u000d\u000a      to Keenan and\u000d\u000a      Mathioudakis in September 2007, followed by STFC grants for &#163;99K in August\u000d\u000a      2009 and &#163;51K in\u000d\u000a      August 2012 and an FP7 Integrated Infrastructures Initiative grant in\u000d\u000a      April 2013 for &#8364;223K to\u000d\u000a      Keenan and Mathioudakis to support ROSA operations. Since its successful\u000d\u000a      deployment in August\u000d\u000a      2008, ROSA has been extensively used to investigate high-frequency waves\u000d\u000a      in the Sun. It is now\u000d\u000a      one of the top requested instruments at the Dunn Solar Telescope in New\u000d\u000a      Mexico, the prime US\u000d\u000a      facility for solar ground-based observations. Mathioudakis and Dr Jess\u000d\u000a      subsequently won the\u000d\u000a      inaugural Andor Insight Award for scientifically-captivating imaging\u000d\u000a      obtained with Andor equipment\u000d\u000a      (November 2011), which attracted extensive publicity, e.g. see:\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/phys.org\/wire-news\/54477731\/stellar-success-for-queens-solar-stars.htm\u000d\u000a    Exoplanet research:\u000d\u000a      One of the most important scientific advances in recent years has been the\u000d\u000a      discovery of\u000d\u000a      exoplanets, i.e. planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. The best\u000d\u000a      method for discovering\u000d\u000a      exoplanets is through transit surveys (watching for the dip in the light\u000d\u000a      from a star resulting when the\u000d\u000a      planet passes directly between the star and the observer during its\u000d\u000a      orbit). When coupled with\u000d\u000a      follow-up observations, such transit surveys provide measurements of\u000d\u000a      planetary masses and\u000d\u000a      densities, and potentially spectroscopy of planetary atmospheres. The most\u000d\u000a      successful Earth-based\u000d\u000a      transit discovery systems to date have been the Andor camera-based\u000d\u000a      SuperWASP (Wide\u000d\u000a      Angle Search for Planets) facilities, whose development was led by Prof\u000d\u000a      Pollacco and colleagues\u000d\u000a      (note that Pollacco left QUB in August 2012). Although the SuperWasp\u000d\u000a      project officially began in\u000d\u000a      2000\/2001, its genesis can be traced back to the mid-1990's when, together\u000d\u000a      with the team at ING\u000d\u000a      in La Palma, Pollacco developed a series of cameras with wide\u000d\u000a      fields-of-view, known as CoCam.\u000d\u000a      When it became clear that these cameras might allow exoplanet transits to\u000d\u000a      be discovered, plans\u000d\u000a      were developed to build WASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) in 1999\/2000.\u000d\u000a      Observations using\u000d\u000a      WASP in Summer 2000 demonstrated the ability to detect planetary transits,\u000d\u000a      thus prompting further\u000d\u000a      system developments and the creation of the SuperWASP-North and -South\u000d\u000a      projects [4], funded\u000d\u000a      by an initial PPARC grant for &#163;105K to Pollacco, Keenan and Fitzsimmons in\u000d\u000a      April 2001, and a\u000d\u000a      subsequent PPARC award for &#163;464K in April 2008 to Pollacco and Keenan to\u000d\u000a      operate the\u000d\u000a      SuperWASP-North facility. To date, these facilities have led to the\u000d\u000a      discovery of &gt;90 transiting\u000d\u000a      exoplanets, with more to be announced [5, 6]. More importantly, in terms\u000d\u000a      of impact, the\u000d\u000a      development of these cameras and their world-wide visibility through the\u000d\u000a      WASP exoplanet\u000d\u000a      programme has led to significant sales for Andor in this market. The\u000d\u000a      societal impact has also been\u000d\u000a      large, with many press and TV-radio articles, including BBC reports, e.g.\u000d\u000a      see:\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/northern_ireland\/7322979.stm\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38362","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    We have had major success in publicising our research in the media, from\u000d\u000a      local radio and newspapers through to national TV appearances. Highlights\u000d\u000a      of our UK national media presence are the SuperWASP showcase on BBC TV\u000d\u000a      \"The Cosmos: A Beginner's Guide - Other worlds\" with Adam Hart-Davis, four\u000d\u000a      appearances on the Sky at Night, and eight appearances on BBC Radio\u000d\u000a      4\/5\/World (typical audience figures 1 &#8212; 10 million for these appearances).\u000d\u000a      Fitzsimmons was the featured scientist on the BBC TV's Horizon Special \"The\u000a        Truth About Meteors\", after the Chelyabinsk meteor impact and has\u000d\u000a      been filmed for another Horizon broadcast on Comet Ison. To increase the\u000d\u000a      public awareness of science in Northern Ireland we have made a focused\u000d\u000a      effort to engage with the local media (BBC and independent broadcasters)\u000d\u000a      to showcase our research highlights and related public events. In total we\u000d\u000a      have had 51 appearances on BBC Northern Ireland (radio and TV), RTE\u000d\u000a      (Republic of Ireland National broadcaster) or other regional broadcasts.\u000d\u000a      These include the BBC Radio Ulster shows \"Good Morning Ulster\" and\u000d\u000a      \"Evening Extra\" and the BBC NI Newsline (the main 6:30pm TV news show).\u000d\u000a      These are the primary BBC news and magazine shows in the weekday morning\u000d\u000a      and evenings, with typical listening figures of 295,000 for the morning\u000d\u000a      and evening radio shows and 140,000 for TV. Our research underpins these\u000d\u000a      appearances as our topics have broad societal interest. We have\u000d\u000a      significantly raised the awareness of our place in the Universe through\u000d\u000a      the studies of planets around other stars, searching for hazardous\u000d\u000a      asteroids and assessing the Sun's affect on the Earth through solar\u000d\u000a      flares. Combining our breakthrough results (Section 3) with a high profile\u000d\u000a      media appearance has allowed us to directly increase the numbers of people\u000d\u000a      attending our organised science events.\u000d\u000a    Our profile allowed us to attract a &#163;200k philanthropic donation from Dr.\u000d\u000a      Michael West to enhance our engagement with the public and increase\u000d\u000a      scientific awareness in this region. This funds a public lecture series\u000d\u000a      and a research fellow who dedicates part of his time to public outreach.\u000d\u000a      The funding is a direct impact of our research and media profile. Due to\u000d\u000a      our geographical position, we need to work harder than other UK centres to\u000d\u000a      get world leading scientists to visit here. We initiated the Michael West\u000d\u000a      Lecture series to do exactly that and now run the most successful public\u000d\u000a      science lecture series ever in Northern Ireland. Since 2008 our nine\u000d\u000a      lectures have attracted over 160 people per event. Numbers have been\u000d\u000a      rising, with excellent feedback which evidences our successful engagement\u000d\u000a      with the public (Section 5). Further initiatives have also arisen from the\u000d\u000a      Michael West fellowship and extra efforts in ARC. These are as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      A partnership with the W5 Discovery Centre (Ireland's award winning\u000d\u000a        science and discovery centre at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast). We\u000d\u000a        developed the \"Planet Quest\" exhibition, based on explaining the\u000d\u000a        multi-wavelength nature of modern astronomy, particularly highlighting\u000d\u000a        infrared radiation. The exhibition showcases our high-profile research,\u000d\u000a        as well as some personal stories, to illustrate to the public that world\u000d\u000a        leading, technology driven research is happening in Belfast. School and\u000d\u000a        summer-school groups are brought to the exhibition, which ends with a\u000d\u000a        game of infra-red laser-tag, based in an alien planet setting. The\u000d\u000a        exhibition ran March-September 2012, and attracted 26,400 visitors. We\u000d\u000a        are STEMnet ambassadors at W5 and have hosted talks, question and answer\u000d\u000a        sessions and hands-on building games (aimed at Key Stage 3 pupils). We\u000d\u000a        have further supported W5 through creation of astronomy CPD materials\u000d\u000a        and a centralized web resource for secondary school physics teachers\u000d\u000a        (Section 5; Source 9).\u000d\u000a      We host, support and sponsor bi-monthly meetings of the Irish\u000d\u000a        Astronomical Association (IAA) at Queen's which brings in around 80\u000d\u000a        people each meeting. ARC staff regularly give lectures and use our\u000d\u000a        influence (and financial resources) to bring in speakers from Britain\u000d\u000a        and Europe. We regularly arrange for our research collaborators to spend\u000d\u000a        more time at Queen's in order to give lectures to the Society and to\u000d\u000a        provide the public with talks that they would otherwise not have access\u000d\u000a        to. We sit on the IAA Council and advise on speakers, joint events and\u000d\u000a        activities.\u000d\u000a      In addition to lectures we have hosted science events attracting large\u000d\u000a        audiences: \"Jupiter Watch\" as part of the BBC's Stargazing live in\u000d\u000a        January 2012 (600 people) and January 2013 (800 people). The Large\u000d\u000a        Hadron Collider exhibition in 2013 attracted over 1000 schoolchildren\u000d\u000a        and members of the general public. Two related lectures and a Caf&#233;\u000d\u000a        Scientifique evening attracted another 700.\u000d\u000a      Astronomy lectures and presentations at the following annual events:\u000d\u000a        (i) QUB Horizons in Physics (which attracts around 400 Year 11-12\u000d\u000a        students per annum), (ii) Physics Open Days (around 200 Y13 students),\u000d\u000a        (iii) Physics Teachers Conference (about 50 Physics teachers from\u000d\u000a        schools in Ireland). Talks based specifically on our research described\u000d\u000a        in Section 2 is in high demand in these outreach events for school\u000d\u000a        children.\u000d\u000a      Talks at schools, mostly at secondary level but also at primary level\u000d\u000a        (we actively take part in STEPS (Source 4)), either in the\u000d\u000a        classroom or at QUB. ARC staff deliver a total of about 40 talks\u000d\u000a        annually to pupils. We also provide these presentations to amateur\u000d\u000a        astronomical clubs and societies, as well as further education colleges,\u000d\u000a        which are given typically 12 times per year. We collaborate with the\u000d\u000a        School of Education at Queen's to deliver projects in astronomy and\u000d\u000a        space science in Schools and public libraries. Over the REF Period we\u000d\u000a        have had projects with 20 schools to develop science podcasts and\u000d\u000a        science journalism. In any one year, we typically reach an audience of\u000d\u000a        around 3000-5000 pupils.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In summary we have an active outreach programme aimed at popularising\u000d\u000a      science, physics and astronomy particularly in N. Ireland. The impact has\u000d\u000a      been a major increase in the appearance of scientists in the media in this\u000d\u000a      UK region, but also a direct and tangible increase in the number of school\u000d\u000a      students taking physics further. Between 2008 and 2012 we have seen an\u000d\u000a      increase in the number of UCAS applications from Northern Ireland students\u000d\u000a      to physics based courses across the UK of 71% (acceptances up by 56%).\u000d\u000a      This is an impact not just in applications to Queen's but applications\u000d\u000a      from NI students to all UK HEIs. In Queen's itself we increased\u000d\u000a      applications by 80% from 272 (in 2008) to 491 (2012). This increase\u000d\u000a      coincides directly with our increase in our public and schools engagement\u000d\u000a      efforts and we believe the impact of our research has directly led to this\u000d\u000a      societal change and increase in the desire of the NI school population to\u000d\u000a      study physics further.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Our high profile astronomy research discoveries in areas of public\u000d\u000a      interest have allowed us to substantially increase the engagement of the\u000d\u000a      public with science. Media appearances have led to a philanthropic\u000d\u000a      donation of &#163;200k to promote our science, the most successful public event\u000d\u000a      series ever in Northern Ireland (engaging around 2000 people), a strategic\u000d\u000a      partnership with Ireland's award winning science education centre W5\u000d\u000a      (reaching 26,000 people), and a 49% increase in applications to physics\u000d\u000a      based degrees from NI students to UK HEIs. In 2008 we set three simple\u000d\u000a      targets to substantially increase the public awareness of science and\u000d\u000a      physics. The first was to increase our presence in the mass media (print,\u000d\u000a      radio, TV, internet) to promote scientific research, and we have regularly\u000d\u000a      reached audiences in excess of 295,000. The second was to increase the\u000d\u000a      numbers of people attending science talks and events. The third was to\u000d\u000a      substantially increase the application rate of school students to study\u000d\u000a      physics and mathematics degrees. Through our outreach and engagement\u000d\u000a      programme we have met, and surpassed, all of these targets. The impact of\u000d\u000a      our research and our public outreach programme is a quantifiable societal\u000d\u000a      change.

When coupled with follow-up\u000d\u000a      observations, such transit surveys can allow measurement of true masses\u000d\u000a      and densities, and potentially spectroscopy of planetary atmospheres. This\u000d\u000a      can provide insights into the existence of water, oxygen, ozone and\u000d\u000a      eventually habitability. The most successful Earth-based transit discovery\u000d\u000a      has been SuperWASP, a project built and led by Queen's. Recently QUB staff\u000d\u000a      (Watson) have begun work on a replacement system for SuperWASP. The NGTS\u000d\u000a      (Next Generation Transit Survey) project is being designed to search for\u000d\u000a      smaller planets around cooler stars. By targeting cooler, less luminous\u000d\u000a      stars, it will be possible to discover smaller exoplanets. Although such\u000d\u000a      hot-Neptunes and super-Earths have been seen previously, NGTS will result\u000d\u000a      in completely characterised systems that will allow their physical\u000d\u000a      attributes to be studied using existing and planned astronomical\u000d\u000a      instruments. The NGTS project will be the most sensitive ground-based\u000d\u000a      survey for super-earths transiting their host stars.\u000d\u000a    Supernova Research &#8212; what is the origin of the chemical elements?\u000d\u000a    Smartt and Maund have led the world's most successful project for\u000d\u000a      discovering the progenitor stars of supernovae. Supernovae are the\u000d\u000a      explosions of stars at the end of their lives and have created all the\u000d\u000a      heavy chemical elements we see in the Universe through nucleosynthesis.\u000d\u000a      Their work allows us to see stars just before they explode, and this ten\u000d\u000a      year project changed the field significantly and led to EURYI award, a\u000d\u000a      Royal Society URF, Leverhulme Prize and finally an ERC Advanced grant.\u000d\u000a      They have written 10 papers in Science and Nature on supernova science\u000d\u000a      since 2004, mostly highly cited discovery papers with major impact in the\u000d\u000a      academic field. This work has led to new insights into the physics of how\u000d\u000a      stars explode, nucleosynthesis of elements in the Universe and how neutron\u000d\u000a      stars and black holes may form. The topic of exploding stars illustrating\u000d\u000a      the dynamic Universe, combined with the leadership in the field has\u000d\u000a      allowed this team to promote the work in the public domain.\u000d\u000a    Solar System research &#8212; will the Earth be hit by an asteroid?\u000d\u000a    Recent events such as the Chelyabinsk asteroid strike have underlined the\u000d\u000a      public's interest in low- probability but high-impact events. Fitzsimmons'\u000d\u000a      work on solar system asteroids and comets led to one of the most high\u000d\u000a      profile science discoveries in 2009. An asteroid on a collision course\u000d\u000a      with the Earth was monitored in space, and tracked as it hit the desert in\u000d\u000a      Sudan. Pieces of the object were recovered, providing the first recovery\u000d\u000a      of an asteroid which was discovered and observed before impact.\u000d\u000a      Fitzsimmons took the only spectrum of this object before collision,\u000d\u000a      published in Nature in 2009 (Jenniskens et al. 2009). Fitzsimmons and his\u000d\u000a      postdoc at the time (S. Lowry) provided the first direct detection of the\u000d\u000a      YORP effect in Science (2007). Both these high profile results again\u000d\u000a      illustrated world-leading research that could be explained to the public\u000d\u000a      in a concise and exciting manner.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38363","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Through the longstanding interaction with AVX Ltd the company was aware\u000a      of our unique academic research involving FIB micromachining allied to\u000a      microscopy of ferroelectrics to reveal intrinsic behaviour and identify\u000a      consequences of defects to capacitor behaviour.\u000a    In 2011, AVX Ltd encountered a reliability problem concerning specific\u000a      MLCC product ranges. Through their Tier 2 customers Lear Corporation and\u000a      Johnson Controls Inc. who on behalf of their Tier 1 customer Volkswagen\u000a      Group (for VW and Audi) reported that the Volkswagen Group had revised the\u000a      environmental specification for MLCC (case sizes 0603 and 0805) for\u000a      automotive applications [Source 1].\u000a    Under revised environmental stress conditions at the customer site and\u000a      subsequently replicated in the AVX Ltd. factory, of increased humidity and\u000a      temperature, the supplied parts where exhibiting unacceptable failure\u000a      rates. \"The automotive industry is one of the most demanding markets\u000a        for MLCC with failure rates often pushed toward no more than 1:109\u000a      parts\" [Source 1]. This arises because both the owner and\u000a      the public on the road perceives particular brand of vehicle to have\u000a      broken down and to not associate the breakdown with failure of a supply\u000a      chain component.\u000a    AVX Ltd made available a selection of operational and failed parts for\u000a      our investigation along with a technical brief on their electrical testing\u000a      to date on the basis that they \"... were aware of the research in\u000a        ceramic capacitors and in particular the innovative focused ion beam\u000a        methods applied to ferroelectrics and capacitors that had been developed\u000a        at Queen's\" [Source 1].\u000a    With our previous research in more sensitive nanoscale capacitors allied\u000a      to our expertise acquired via the KTP project \"handling `green' and\u000a        finished parts\" we were familiar at handling their commercial\u000a      product and that was seen as `beneficial\" [Source 1].\u000a    A MLCC is comprised of a stack of several hundred interleaved\u000a      ferroelectric ceramic and nickel electrode layers. Electric contact to the\u000a      device is then made via end terminations of two layers of nickel and tin.\u000a      The tin layer provides the region for solder contact to be made. In the\u000a      particular product that exhibited failure the electrode is connected to\u000a      the MLCC via a stress relieving silver-polymer composite layer.\u000a    We were able to adapt and formulate a modification to our usual FIB based\u000a      micromachining protocols used in the creation of nanoscale capacitors to\u000a      develop a workflow that would allow us to extract representative sample\u000a      pieces for evaluation and inspection. This adapted workflow meant that we\u000a      were able to perform successional slicing of the MLCC's in a series of\u000a      testing locations.\u000a    Electron microscopy imaging and associated chemical analysis was\u000a      performed on slices extracted and in regions from where they had been\u000a      removed. It became evident that the failure under humidity test was not\u000a      arising from damage to or degradation of the more sensitive ferroelectric\u000a      ceramic material, but instead it was originating at the interface of the\u000a      electrode layers and the ferroelectric ceramic.\u000a    A major challenge, over the last fifteen or so years, in all research and\u000a      engineering of ferroelectric capacitors has been the move away from noble\u000a      metal electrodes and contacts to base metals such as nickel. Nickel will\u000a      unfavourably oxidise at the interface with the oxide-based titanate\u000a      ferroelectric. In this case of these failed parts further detailed\u000a      examination on FIB machined sections led to an unexpected cause of the\u000a      actual device failure. The final overcoat of tin was introducing\u000a      additional stress due to a high deposition rate that was exacerbating the\u000a      delamination of the nickel from the ferroelectric. That delamination then\u000a      provided a path for the metal in the polymer composite to escape under\u000a      application of voltage and caused part failure.\u000a    A report [Source 2] of the investigation and outcomes was prepared\u000a      and a de-briefing meeting at AVX Ltd arranged and the findings presented.\u000a      In addition to the technical staff of AVX Ltd at Coleraine also present\u000a      were engineers from their subsidiary plant in the Czech Republic that\u000a      undertakes the electro-plating of the metal electrode layers.\u000a    In addressing the reach and significance of this impact we note that\u000a      while AVX Ltd is based in Coleraine, Northern Ireland (NI), they are part\u000a      of AVX Corporation who are in turn part of Kyocera Electronic Devices in\u000a      the Kyocera Group.\u000a    As of 2012 AVX Ltd. employed 317 people in NI and had a &#163;108M turnover;\u000a      no profit figures are available [Source 3].

This eradicated\u000a      the part failures to an accepted tolerance level and thus allowed them to\u000a      deliver on the contract to their Tier 2 customers Lear Corporation and\u000a      Johnson Controls Inc. who then in turn supply to their Tier 1 customers VW\u000a      and Audi [Source 1].\u000a    AVX Ltd. have confirmed that the value of the international contract was\u000a      \"valued at $0.6M\".

Ferroelectrics were receiving significant commercial\u000a      interest in numerous capacitor applications\/markets. A key element in the\u000a      early research was the fabrication and functional characterisation of very\u000a      simple thin film planar capacitor structures based on titanates. These\u000a      were investigated in an attempt to elucidate fundamental reasons for the\u000a      dramatic collapse in permittivity, that reduces device capacitance, with\u000a      decreasing device thickness and which was not understood at the time [Reference\u000a        1]. This was of great importance as titanates are of principal use\u000a      for both commercial ceramic capacitors (circa 1012 components\u000a      manufactured p.a.) such as the X7R devices and for novel high-K\u000a      perovskite-based Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) systems\u000a      conceptualised at the time.\u000a    While capacitor structures made in-house did allow useful insights [Reference\u000a        2], it soon became clear that ferroelectric (dielectric) properties\u000a      were so sensitive to defects, introduced during thin film growth, that a\u000a      radically new experimental approach was needed. Thus, from 2002, a wholly\u000a      novel programme in which thin film capacitors were made from small slices\u000a      of ferroelectric cut from high purity single crystals using Focused Ion\u000a      Beam (FIB) milling [Reference 3] was initiated. Functional\u000a      characterisation of these relatively unclamped defect-free systems\u000a      demonstrated that the permittivity did not necessarily collapse with\u000a      dielectric thickness decrease at all and that the effect could be\u000a      engineered out in real devices. Such insights were published in a number\u000a      of articles between 2004 and 2009 [Reference 4, 5].\u000a    At the same time as this FIB micro-machining work progressed that\u000a      included further insights into damage mitigation [Reference 6] we\u000a      commenced a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with AVX Ltd. The\u000a      three-year project from 2005-2007 worth &#163;123K was titled \"Critical\u000a        interfaces in currently produced capacitors\". The project engaged\u000a      M.M. Saad, primary author of Reference 3, as the Knowledge Transfer\u000a      Associate. The project combined precision micro-machining by FIB to\u000a      isolate known and potential defects and regions of MLCCs for detailed\u000a      chemical and structural analysis that would then be followed up via TEM\u000a      (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and STEM (Scanning Transmission\u000a      Electron Microscopy). In the programme the parts investigated covered X7R\u000a      specifications for in consumer electronics applications through to those\u000a      for high voltage automotive usage. This provided Bowman and Gregg with\u000a      significant bilateral experience in handling of parts and establishing\u000a      common terminological ground for the use of the research methodologies and\u000a      results to be applied to evaluating the defects that arise in such\u000a      commercial components.\u000a    We note that associated research in thin film capacitors remains an\u000a      active area of endeavour, most recently via Technology Strategy Board\u000a      (TSB) support of a project \"Advanced capacitors for energy storage\"\u000a      with Syfer Technology worth &#163;164K in 2010-12 and has received significant\u000a      recent press attention http:\/\/goo.gl\/p1kp12.\u000a      Such collaborations have tapped various aspects of the ferroelectrics\u000a      expertise developed in Queen's, but microscopy and FIB-processing\u000a      knowledge has been crucial in all collaborative research to date.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38364","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    High-end computation tools and techniques are an essential complement to\u000a      theory and experiment for many of today's scientific and technological\u000a      challenges. Challenges investigated include, amongst many others,\u000a      improving the accuracy of weather forecasting [1] and the relationship\u000a      between genetic markers and cancer [2]. High-end computational facilities\u000a      are thus indispensable for scientific and technological progress in many\u000a      disciplines. This strategic importance was underpinned by the investment\u000a      of &#163;113M made by the UK Government to install and operate the HECToR\u000a      high-performance computing (HPC) facility over the period 2007-March 2014\u000a      [3,4]. The facility provided 11328 cores in Phase 1 (2007), and expanded\u000a      to 22656 cores in Phase 2a (2009), to 44544 cores in Phase 2b (2010), and\u000a      to 90112 cores in Phase 3 (2011) [5].\u000a    The HECToR HPC facility has been of strategic importance to the UK, as it\u000a      enables the UK to be recognised as an international leader for\u000a      computational science and engineering. The repeated upgrades of the\u000a      facility are of major importance to ensure that the facility maintains its\u000a      position as an internationally leading HPC facility. Usage statistics\u000a      further demonstrate the significance of HECToR to HPC users, including\u000a      industrial users. Typical usage from September 2012 &#8212; August 2013 shows\u000a      that over 60000 processors are in use on average, with peak demand well\u000a      over 85000 processors [6].\u000a    To guarantee that the investment provided by UK Government was spent\u000a      judiciously, the procurement of the HECToR facility was overseen by EPSRC\u000a      on behalf of the UK Research Councils. NAG Ltd. conducted the benchmarking\u000a      process and operated the various acceptance tests for the different stages\u000a      of HECToR, to ensure that the pre-agreed performance levels of the\u000a      facility were met. To assess the vendors, a scoring system was put in\u000a      place, in which the benchmarking process formed a substantial part of the\u000a      overall score. (For the next UK high-performance computing facility\u000a      ARCHER, benchmarking accounted for 35% of the overall score, and vendors\u000a      were informed that those vendors that put significant effort into the\u000a      benchmark tests tended to score better overall [7].) Five application\u000a      codes were selected to participate in the HECToR benchmarking tests, one\u000a      of which was the HELIUM code [8].\u000a    The HELIUM code was selected for inclusion amongst the benchmark codes\u000a      for the following reasons [8]. With HECToR being the replacement facility\u000a      for CSAR and HPCx, the most heavily used codes from this service were\u000a      prime candidates for the procurement benchmarks. These candidate codes\u000a      were assessed by NAG Ltd. for suitability. HELIUM was assessed to be a\u000a      cleanly structured code, without complicated software dependencies. This\u000a      was a major advantage for porting to the wide range of different\u000a      architectures that were offered by the competing hardware vendors. In\u000a      addition, good support was available from Prof. Taylor and Dr. Parker at\u000a      QUB, and one of the members of the NAG benchmarking team was familiar with\u000a      an earlier version of the code. Finally, the use of finite-difference\u000a      methods in the HELIUM code complemented the different approaches pursued\u000a      by other benchmark applications well. This is important in the procurement\u000a      of a general purpose system, which will be used by a wide variety of users\u000a      in many application areas. It is also important during acceptance testing:\u000a      the system must be capable of performing at pre-agreed levels at each\u000a      Phase of the installation for this wide variety of users.\u000a    Another important consideration for inclusion of the HELIUM code amongst\u000a      the benchmark codes was its scalability [8]. The scale of the HECToR\u000a      facility increased by a factor 8 during its lifetime. It was thus\u000a      essential that benchmark codes offered the potential to run efficiently on\u000a      next-generation facilities. NAG Ltd. assessed that the HELIUM code can be\u000a      configured with ease to run on very large core counts. Hence, the HELIUM\u000a      code played a particular important role in the acceptance tests for Phase\u000a      2b and Phase 3, where the hardware vendor was required to demonstrate that\u000a      benchmark codes, such as the HELIUM code, could run for several hours on\u000a      &gt;90% of the total number of cores available (~40000 for Phase 2b and\u000a      ~80000 for Phase 3), to give confidence that the system was sufficiently\u000a      stable and reliable for production use on large scale, capability jobs.\u000a    The HELIUM code has helped EPSRC to demonstrate expected value for money\u000a      for the &#163;113M investment provided by the UK Government in the\u000a      high-performance computing facility HECToR. Immediately after delivery of\u000a      each phase, the HECToR facility has consistently ranked as a top-20\u000a      facility in the world, and a top-5 facility in the EU, (17th in\u000a      November 2007 (phase 1), 20th in November 2009 (phase 2a), 16th\u000a      in June 2010 (phase 2b), and 19th in November 2011) [9]. These\u000a      rankings demonstrate a leadership position of the UK in the strategically\u000a      important area of High-Performance Computing.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The High Performance Computing (HPC) application code HELIUM, developed\u000a      at Queen's University Belfast to assist the development of attosecond\u000a      technology, has impacted on the provision of public services through\u000a      guiding procurement and acceptance testing of the high-performance\u000a      computer facility HECToR. This facility was funded by UK Government with a\u000a      total expenditure of &#163;113M during 2007 - 2013. The HELIUM code was used\u000a      for procurement and acceptance testing for the initial HECToR service in\u000a      2007 (Phase 1, 11k cores), and its upgrades in 2009 (Phase 2a, 22k cores),\u000a      2010 (Phase 2b, 44k cores) and 2011 (Phase 3, 90k cores). The HELIUM code\u000a      was particularly invaluable in demonstrating that the Phase 2b and Phase 3\u000a      systems perform correctly at pre-agreed performance levels, since this\u000a      code can be adapted to run for several hours over &gt;80k cores.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    Queen's University Belfast\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen's University Belfast","InstitutionName":"Queen's University Belfast","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10005343}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    The papers which we identify to best illustrate the quality of the\u000a      research are papers 2, 4 and 6.\u000a    \u000a[1] J.

Taylor (Professor of Physics, QUB 1993-2013) with\u000a      an award for a three-year postdoctoral fellowship to develop computational\u000a      codes to answer prominent scientific questions. Following the purchase by\u000a      the Research Councils in 1994 of a 256-processor Cray T3D machine, Prof.\u000a      Taylor decided to investigate what happens to the dynamics of individual\u000a      electrons in a strong laser field when their strong repulsion is taken\u000a      into account.\u000a    This prominent question remains an important one to date for atomic\u000a      physics and for laser physics. Electron repulsion cannot be neglected in\u000a      dynamics on the sub-femtosecond timescale. Detailed understanding about\u000a      the coupled electron dynamics requires simultaneous analysis of\u000a      time-dependent dynamics of individual electrons and detailed treatment of\u000a      the interactions between them. The scale of this problem exceeds\u000a      traditional problems by several orders of magnitude: its numerical\u000a      solution requires massively parallel computational facilities. Professor\u000a      Taylor and Dr J.S. Parker (postdoctoral research fellow, QUB 1993-present)\u000a      developed a finite-difference code which could efficiently exploit these\u000a      facilities, including extensive computation and extensive data transfer:\u000a      the HELIUM code. In 1996, a paper demonstrated successful initial\u000a      application of the HELIUM code for a laser wavelength of 248 nm [1].\u000a    The application of finite-difference techniques enabled Dr. Parker to\u000a      construct the code such that it could handle the projected exponential\u000a      growth in HPC power. The atomic wavefunction is described on a\u000a      multi-dimensional radial grid. This grid can be distributed efficiently\u000a      across (tens of) thousands of processors. Dr. Parker and E.S. Smyth (Ph.D.\u000a      student 1996-1999) further implemented an Arnoldi-Krylov algorithm which\u000a      provided stable time propagation using only (parallelisable) matrix-vector\u000a      multiplications [2]. The code therefore scales very well from hundreds to\u000a      tens of thousands processors. This computational excellence of the HELIUM\u000a      code was recognised through the award to Prof. Taylor, Dr. Parker and\u000a      B.J.S. Doherty (Ph.D. student 2004-2007) in 2006 of a UK Research\u000a      Councils' HEC Strategy Committee High Performance Computing Prize in the\u000a      category of fastest application improvement, for their work on\u000a      re-engineering the HELIUM code on HPCx.\u000a    The dedication to numerical techniques that allow efficient exploitation\u000a      of future HPC facilities enabled Prof. Taylor, Dr. Parker and co-workers\u000a      to explore new science from 1997 to 2006 following subsequent investment\u000a      into HPC facilities (T3E, HPCx) using the HELIUM code. Between 1999 and\u000a      2003 many fundamental scientific discoveries were made, most notably in\u000a      the general features of double ionization [3], the prediction of double\u000a      above-threshold ionization [4] and in time delays in double ionization\u000a      [5]. Subsequently, emphasis on comparison with experiment resulted in a\u000a      2006 publication on the energy distribution of ejected electrons, which\u000a      showed almost unparalleled agreement between theory and experiment [6].\u000a    The techniques used within the HELIUM code continue to be exploited to\u000a      this day. Prof. Taylor and Prof. H.W. van der Hart (Professor in\u000a      Theoretical Physics, QUB 1999-present) combined their expertise to lead a\u000a      5-year EPSRC HPC software-development programme (UK-RAMP, involving\u000a      University College London, the Open University and STFC Daresbury\u000a      Laboratory), in which the algorithms underpinning the HELIUM code are\u000a      combined with R-matrix techniques to explore ultra-fast multi-electron\u000a      dynamics in atoms and molecules.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38365","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Seagate Technology has two sites for development and manufacture of\u000d\u000a      read\/write heads (the micro-scale component that reads and writes\u000d\u000a      information to a hard disk), Bloomington, Minnesota, USA and Springtown\u000d\u000a      (Derry), Northern Ireland.

Understanding and controlling the processing\u000d\u000a      and fabrication of nanoscale ferroic materials (e.g. ferroelectrics and\u000d\u000a      ferromagnetics), developing methodologies to explore ferroic domain\u000d\u000a      formation and switching on sub 100-nm lengths are key basic enablers for\u000d\u000a      future hard-disk read\/write technology.

PEPT is the only\u000d      existing technique capable of imagining complex flow, mixing and\u000d      comminution (grinding) processes within opaque industrial equipment.\u000d      Optimisation of these leads to minimisation of processing time, enhanced\u000d      throughput and in the case of mineral processing a reduction of wear on\u000d      expensive plant.\u000d    The revolutionary development of the PEPT has permitted both the\u000d      validation and further refinement of process modelling and has been widely\u000d      used within the industrial processing sector. Companies such as\u000d      AstraZeneca, Johnson Matthey Catalysts and Procter and Gamble have used\u000d      the technique for optimization of processes ranging from drug manufacture\u000d      to understanding washing machines and dishwashers &#8212; leading to cost and\u000d      efficiency savings.

The measurements were used to determine the\u000d      influence of key parameters such as machine design, process operation and\u000d      polymer system. The results were used to establish knowledge based machine\u000d      design criteria and operation guidelines, and to develop both new and\u000d      existing commercial simulation and modelling software &#8212; the results were\u000d      applied to eight different commercial case studies. This EU funded\u000d      project, called PEPTflow, ran until December 2009 and had a significant\u000d      impact on the competitiveness of SMEs throughout the plastic supply chain,\u000d      realising higher added value and improved products and services. The\u000d      project brought together 25 organisations (research groups, equipment\u000d      manufacturers and industrial users). [s1]\u000d    Pharmaceutical manufacture studies: Continuous processing has\u000d      recently emerged as an area of interest for the pharmaceutical industry,\u000d      where potential benefits include faster and lower cost of development,\u000d      increased process robustness, improved product yields and greater supply\u000d      chain flexibility. Roller compaction and twin screw wet granulation are\u000d      two important technologies which can be used to achieve continuous\u000d      granulation.\u000d    The roller compaction process involves the compaction of fine\u000d      powders into ribbons or flakes that are subsequently milled to produce\u000d      granules. The milling process is critical for controlling the properties\u000d      of the granules, but an understanding of the governing design and\u000d      operating factors is still in its infancy. PEPT was employed to examine\u000d      the kinematics of roll compacted ribbons at various milling speeds using\u000d      both single tracer and two tracers approaches. The PEPT data revealed that\u000d      the mill speed plays an important role. At low mill speeds, the milling\u000d      process is dominated by cooperative motion of the ribbons and the blade,\u000d      with size reduction occurring primarily by abrasion. At high mill speeds,\u000d      ribbons move randomly with comminution by impact breakage. This research\u000d      was funded by AstraZeneca (description adapted from supporting statement\u000d      from AZ [s2]).\u000d    Washing machine and dishwasher design: The work done on the\u000d      characterisation of internal processing in mechanical washing devices has\u000d      influenced the design of the cleaning formulations and has led to products\u000d      that minimise energy and water usage. Procter &amp; Gamble is one of the\u000d      largest R&amp;D employers' in the North East of England and over the last\u000d      10 years have developed a strong relationship with the University of\u000d      Birmingham &#8212; both with Chemical Engineering and Physics. Through the use\u000d      of PEPT they have been able to quantify mechanical forces within washing\u000d      machines, allowing them to understand mass transfer limitations in the\u000d      laundry washing process. These insights are leading to an optimisation of\u000d      P&amp;G detergent formulations and to significant improvements in energy\u000d      efficiency and environmental performance. The impact is significant; in\u000d      Europe alone, about 270 billion washing operations are performed annually,\u000d      each using about 20L of water and 1KWh of power. In order to realise the\u000d      full potential of their formulations in reducing the amount of water and\u000d      energy required during cleaning, careful characterisation of the phenomena\u000d      occurring during cleaning under real conditions is critical; only PEPT has\u000d      been able to provide this to-date. In the short term, the use of PEPT has\u000d      allowed P&amp;G to improve the methods used to evaluate performance of\u000d      formulations under real conditions, resulting in faster and cheaper\u000d      testing at their technical centres.

Johnson Matthey continues\u000d      to support PEPT through EngD and PhD projects.\u000d    PEPT impact on mining and milling in South Africa using Birmingham\u000d        expertise\u000d    The PEPT technique developed at Birmingham has now been established at\u000d      iThemba Labs in Cape Town (2009). This facility was established with key\u000d      support by the Birmingham Group and mirrors Birmingham's facility. This\u000d      has now led to significant impact in the mining and milling sector (descriptions\u000a        adapted from supporting statement from the South African Centre for\u000d        Minerals Research [s5 and s6]). All Impact is in the period\u000d      (2009-2013). The commercial nature of many of these developments mean that\u000d      companies will not release details of direct economic benefit, but as an\u000d      example of the level; the annual revenue of companies such of\u000d      AngloAmerican Platinum exceeds &#163;1b [s7] and there has been significant\u000d      impact on the efficiency of their operations from this research.\u000d    Comminution in platinum mining: Xstrata funded a project to study\u000d      the motion of grinding media in stirred mills used for minerals\u000d      comminution in platinum mining. The aim was to understand the reasons for\u000d      high wear rates in certain portions of the mill and come up with options\u000d      to address the causes. The study was able to provide insights into the\u000d      causes for high wear rates in some sections of the stirred mill and have\u000d      used the data to improve the life of the lining material in these mills.\u000d      Here PEPT studies revealed for the first time that compaction of material\u000d      occurs in the first chamber of the mill leading to excessive wear in this\u000d      region.\u000d    Performance of tumbling mills: This project was initially funded\u000d      by the South African Minerals to Metals Research Institute, SAMMRI. SAMMRI\u000d      was established by AngloAmerican, Lonmin, Impala, AngloGold Ashanti and\u000d      Exxaro to ensure the growth, sustainability and global competitiveness of\u000d      South African mining. The initial research was aimed at studying the\u000d      influence of different liner\/lifter designs on the performance of tumbling\u000d      mills. The PEPT study provided insights on the influence of key design\u000d      variables on mill performance and the data used to test if the simulation\u000d      model being developed captured the actual characteristics of the mill. The\u000d      results have now attracted further follow-on funding from AngloAmerican.\u000d    PEPT was used to study the transport of particles in the tumbling mill\u000d      with a view of isolating the important variables that can be optimised to\u000d      increase tumbling mill capacity while achieving a relatively fine product\u000d      size. The PEPT studies showed that when an intermediate grinding media\u000d      size is used the tumbling mill is able to process more material compared\u000d      to the smaller or bigger media. This insight was implemented on three\u000d      Anglo American Platinum plants and resulted in an increase in production\u000d      on two plants. It was not possible to quantify the influence of changing\u000d      the grinding media size on the third plant because they changed the shaft\u000d      where ore was being drawn from at the same time.\u000d    AngloAmerican Platinum also funded a project to study the influence of\u000d      speed on utilisation of energy in tumbling mills, i.e. to establish the\u000d      optimum speed for various types of mills. A model was developed from the\u000d      PEPT measurements which showed that operating the mills at very high\u000d      speeds resulted in transferring energy to the charge (raw materials inside\u000d      the mills) more than once per revolution. The study showed that very low\u000d      speeds resulted in transferring energy to the charge less than once per\u000d      revolution. Having an energy transfer rate much lower than 1, resulted in\u000d      less breakage and a fine product is predominantly produced. Energy\u000d      transfer rates much higher than once per revolution resulted in high\u000d      capacity but very coarse product. The outcomes from this project have\u000d      assisted in most of the designs where the budget is not sufficient to\u000d      install variable speed drives on the mills. The model is used to predict\u000d      the optimum speed for the given conditions and a decision on the speed of\u000d      the fixed speed motor is taken. The size of the motor is an important\u000d      design consideration and being able to predict the optimum speed results\u000d      in significant savings on the capital costs for the plant. This model was\u000d      developed using data from PEPT experiments and calibrated against pilot\u000d      plant and industrial plant data. Based on this work AngloAmerican Platinum\u000d      has agreed to fund PEPT related projects on tumbling mills for another 5\u000d      years.\u000d    The third project funded by AngloAmerican Platinum involved using PEPT to\u000d      develop a model for the transport of particulate materials in the\u000d      tumbling. Grinding in tumbling mills involve transport the material from\u000d      the inlet to discharge and out of the mill. This process controls the\u000d      capacity of the mill and there are no models in the literature than can be\u000d      used to predict the transport of particles in the tumbling mills. The\u000d      reason for not having reliable models for this important process was due\u000d      to the lack of a technique for measuring the flow of particulate materials\u000d      in opaque systems containing slurry and particles. Therefore, all models\u000d      were developed using many assumptions regarding the influence of slurry.\u000d      PEPT has provided numerous insights regarding the important variables for\u000d      this important part of the grinding process. The insights have been\u000d      implemented on selected operating plants and the results presently look\u000d      encouraging and will lead to the optimisation of the throughput of the\u000d      mill and minimisation of cost and energy consumption.\u000d    Optimisation of Ball Mill operation: AngloAmerican Platinum are\u000d      using PEPT to study the behaviour of charge and grinding media in\u000d      laboratory-scale ball mills in order to optimise operating conditions and\u000d      reduce energy consumption (typically comminution corresponds to 65-80% of\u000d      energy used in the mine-milling process). A simple model of mill operation\u000d      has been developed. To enable results obtained at laboratory scale to be\u000d      adapted to full scale plant, AngloAmerican Platinum has recently\u000d      instrumented its full scale mills with sensors for process\u000d      characterisation. \"The ongoing support from the companies listed above\u000d        and the outcomes from the PEPT study is a clear indication that it is an\u000d        important tool in improving the understanding of comminution processes.\u000d        The results from the projects listed above have also shown that the\u000d        information has already started contributing to resolving some\u000d        challenges encountered in Mineral processing comminution plants.\"\u000d      Head of Comminution Research, Centre for Minerals Research, Cape Town.\u000d      [s5]\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The challenge of observing complex industrial processes in optically\u000d      opaque machinery has limited the potential for optimising efficiency and\u000d      throughput.

Both rely on detecting the pairs of\u000d      back-to-back gamma-rays emitted during positron\/electron annihilation for\u000d      localising a positron-emitting radioactive tracer. In PET the\u000d      concentration of a radioactively-labelled fluid tracer is mapped in 3D,\u000d      whereas in PEPT a single radioactively-labelled particle is accurately\u000d      tracked at high speed &#8212; making the technique suitable for studying high\u000d      speed flows. PEPT can be used to study flow in granular material\u000d      (labelling and tracking a single grain) or viscous fluid flow (using a\u000d      neutrally-buoyant tracer particle). Because the gamma-rays concerned are\u000d      highly penetrating, measurements can be made through thick steel walls,\u000d      enabling non-invasive studies to be performed on realistic engineering\u000d      systems.\u000d    The basic concept was first described by Parker (Professor of Physics) et\u000d      al in 1993 [1], and the technique has been continuously developed and\u000d      refined by the Birmingham group in the subsequent years through the\u000d      development of improved positron cameras, tracer labelling techniques and\u000d      methods for extracting information from PEPT data [2]. In 1999 the\u000d      original Birmingham positron camera (initially developed for performing\u000d      PET studies) was replaced by a commercially-available gamma camera PET\u000d      system leading to a dramatic improvement in sensitivity and precision of\u000d      location in PEPT. In recent years further improvements have been achieved\u000d      by adapting medical PET scanners as transportable modular positron cameras\u000d      for PEPT as well as allowing PEPT measurements to be performed on\u000d      larger-scale equipment and at other sites. These PEPT systems offer\u000d      significantly higher data rates and enable accurate tracking of\u000d      faster-moving tracers [3, 4 and 5]. Early studies were restricted to\u000d      labelling and tracking glass spheres several mm in diameter but, thanks to\u000d      a continuous programme of research and development at Birmingham, a wide\u000d      range of materials with sizes as small as 50 f06dm can now be labelled and\u000d      tracked.\u000d    The radionuclides needed for this work are produced using a cyclotron: to\u000d      this end in 2002 the elderly Radial Ridge Cyclotron was replaced by the\u000d      MC40 Cyclotron which enables production of a much wider range of\u000d      positron-emitting radionuclides. In parallel, techniques have been\u000d      developed for extracting information such as time-averaged velocity fields\u000d      and dispersion coefficients from the PEPT data. The Birmingham group has\u000d      applied PEPT to study a wide range of systems of academic or generic\u000d      interest, ranging from vibrofluidised granular beds to flows of\u000d      non-Newtonian viscous fluids.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38826","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The search for an understanding of the Universe as a whole (Astrophysics)\u000d\u000a      and of its fundamental constituents (Particle and Nuclear Physics) holds a\u000d\u000a      special fascination for young people and the public at large.

The impact described in this\u000d\u000a      case study is underpinned by the University of Birmingham's cutting-edge\u000d\u000a      research in Astrophysics, Nuclear Physics and Particle Physics.

Members of Birmingham's Particle Physics group\u000d\u000a      have a long history of leading roles in experiments (e.g. UA1, OPAL,\u000d\u000a      ATLAS) which have been central to the establishment of the Standard Model,\u000d\u000a      notably through the discoveries of the W, Z (led by Prof. Dowell) and\u000d\u000a      Higgs bosons. As of March 2013, Prof. Charlton is the spokesperson of the\u000d\u000a      ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Group members\u000d\u000a      designed and constructed essential parts of the ATLAS detector and in its\u000d\u000a      exploitation phase are central to the Higgs search programme [1], to\u000d\u000a      studies of top and other heavy quarks and to strong interaction physics.\u000d\u000a      In the LHCb and NA62 experiments, group members perform precise\u000d\u000a      measurements of decays that are ultra-rare in the Standard Model, but can\u000d\u000a      be enhanced by the influence of processes only allowed in Standard-Model\u000d\u000a      extensions [2].

This state is thought to have\u000d\u000a      existed in the first ten microseconds after the formation of the Universe,\u000d\u000a      and is recreated in heavy-ion collisions in ALICE at the LHC. Members of\u000d\u000a      the Nuclear Physics group have leading roles in studies of the properties\u000d\u000a      of the quark-gluon plasma, and the production of specific particle species\u000d\u000a      in this medium [3]. These studies provide new information on the strong\u000d\u000a      interaction, and improve understanding of the early Universe.

Prof Weaver\u000a      was head of the PTNR course before passing it on to Dr. Norman. The\u000a      steering committee for the PTNR course includes most of the major\u000a      companies across the UK nuclear industry, whose funding underpins the\u000a      courses continuation. Members of the Birmingham Nuclear group have also\u000a      participated in international reviews, for example Prof. D.R.

This, and the associated applied\u000a      nuclear research programme, provided the foundations for the Policy\u000a      Commission on the Future of Nuclear Power in the UK. Key elements of the\u000a      report feature R&amp;D capability and skills capacity, both of which link\u000a      directly to the expertise of the Birmingham Nuclear group.\u000a    The Policy Commission examining \"The Future of Nuclear Energy\" was\u000a      chaired by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, and brought together key\u000a      representatives from the nuclear industry, national policy, universities,\u000a      NGOs, government agencies and the financial sector &#8212; the meetings were\u000a      also attended by several international organisations.

These workshops and\u000a      debates were designed to draw out the key challenges facing the UK in the\u000a      development of a new nuclear build programme. These include the impact on\u000a      climate change, finance and the energy markets, nuclear supply chain,\u000a      nuclear training and skills, public opinion and perceptions, waste storage\u000a      and disposal and the nuclear fuel cycle. In addition, a more forward\u000a      looking component of the policy review was an examination of future\u000a      technologies (so-called Generation IV) and how these might fit into the\u000a      UKs future energy plan. Altogether, there were &gt;50 expert participants\u000a      in the debates and workshops.\u000a    The commissioners included academics from disciplines across the\u000a      University of Birmingham (Prof. David Weaver, Prof. Lynne Macaskie, Dr.\u000a      Paul Norman, Dr. John Walls and Prof. Martin Freer) and external\u000a      commissioners: Prof. Richard Green (Imperial), Richard Rankin (Idaho\u000a      National Laboratory, US), Stephen Tindale (Centre for European Reform),\u000a      Simon Webster (Head of the Unit responsible for managing the Euratom\u000a      programme of EU-funded research activities in nuclear fission science\u000a      &amp; technology) and Prof. Andrew Worrall (Technical Authority for\u000a      Reactors and Fuels at the UK National Nuclear Laboratory now ORNL, US).\u000a      The connection between the research and track record of the nuclear group\u000a      and the work of the policy commission exemplified through Prof. Weaver.\u000a    Reach\u000a      The final report of the commission was published on 2nd July\u000a      2012, and launched at an event involving a panel discussion with Tim Yeo\u000a      MP (Chair, Energy and Climate Change Committee), Professor Martin Freer\u000a      (Policy Commission Academic Director) and Stephen Tindale (Climate and\u000a      Energy Consultant, Associate Fellow at the Centre for European Reform and\u000a      a member of the Commission). The discussion was chaired by Fiona Fox\u000a      (Chief Executive, Science Media Centre).

This second debate formed part of the discussion for a BBC\u000a      world service `One Planet' programme on nuclear energy and the \"Naked\u000a      Scientist\". Comment pieces authored by the commission were covered in\u000a      newspapers in 22 countries and 8 languages: Arabic, Chinese, English,\u000a      French, Macedonian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish (including Al Jazeera &#8212;\u000a      English).\u000a    The conclusions of the report were covered in Public Service Europe [1],\u000a      an exclusive in the Sunday Telegraph [1], NEI Nuclear Notes blog `Whither\u000a      British Nuclear Energy', Out-Law.com `Government must take some of the\u000a      financial risk of new nuclear to encourage investment, says report',\u000a      Securing the Future [1] and Nuclear Future (magazine of the nuclear\u000a      industry). Elements of the report were also featured on BBC Sunday\u000a      Politics Show, featuring a section with Prof. Freer and an undergraduate\u000a      student on the future of nuclear in the UK and the policy commission. The\u000a      Commission also hosted a fringe debate at the 2012 Labour Party conference\u000a      in Manchester involving Tom Greatrex MP (Shadow Energy Minister) and\u000a      Geoffrey Lean (Environment Correspondent, The Telegraph).\u000a    Significance\u000a      The report [2] was submitted to the department of Business Innovation and\u000a      Science (BIS) to help shape their review of UK Nuclear R&amp;D\u000a      capabilities performed by the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir\u000a      John Beddington. Several hundred copies of the report were circulated to\u000a      DECC and leading policy makers in the UK and organisations in the EU and\u000a      US.

Materials research, involving\u000a      both nuclear fuel post-irradiation examination and characterisation\u000a      (fission) and development of advanced structural materials (fusion and\u000a      fission), is a critical area for advanced nuclear technology in general,\u000a      and the solid basis of UK expertise in these fundamental fields would\u000a      benefit considerably from enhanced national support.\" &#8212; DECC has now\u000a      funded &#163;15M for a new world class National Nuclear Users Facility for\u000a      nuclear materials research and &#163;12.5M for a UK stake in the Jules Horowitz\u000a      materials test reactor. Similarly, the commission suggested \"The\u000a      Government should set up a statutory Nuclear Policy Council, or similar,\u000a      modelled on the Committee on Climate Change, that can establish and\u000a      champion a long-term, technically informed, roadmap for nuclear energy in\u000a      the UK.\", and subsequently a series of national committees have been\u000a      formed which include Nuclear Innovation Research Office (NIRO) which will\u000a      develop and take forward the work of the newly created Nuclear Innovation\u000a      Research Advisory Board (NIRAB). It is not possible to establish direct\u000a      cause and effect, but the statements from those involved in the\u000a      development of the Government position [4, 8] indicate the importance of\u000a      the report in shaping the government's conclusions.\u000a    The Commission's report and the subsequent debates on its findings have\u000a      informed the complex policy debate surrounding changes in UK policy, with\u000a      the potential nuclear new build programme estimated to correspond to an\u000a      investment of over &#163;40billion in the UK economy, not to mention the\u000a      potential for energy security.\u000a    Sustainability\u000a      As part of broadening public understanding of the issues around UK energy\u000a      policy, nuclear energy and nuclear safety a number of activities have been\u000a      coordinated. These include presentations to the Birmingham Lunar Society\u000a      and Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society (both \"learned\u000a      societies\") and to 6th form school students and teachers.\u000a      Following on from the Commission Freer has been asked to provide input to\u000a      a report by the Committee on Climate Change on greenhouse gas emissions\u000a      from nuclear power, participate in debates on the economic conditions\u000a      surrounding the Electricity Market Reform bill, on the future of energy\u000a      organised by the FSB and to contribute to a meeting on nuclear energy at\u000a      the Royal Academy of Engineering. He has also written a number of comment\u000a      pieces for the \"Conversation\" and \"Pan European Networks\".\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The UK is on the verge of building a fleet of new nuclear power stations.\u000a      The steps required to reach the point where the UK can build Generation\u000a      III+ plants are a complex mix of energy and financial policy and\u000a      technology. The issues connect with the fuel cycle, waste disposal and\u000a      public opinion. Failure in one of these areas could derail the new build\u000a      programme. Starting in 2011, finishing July 2012, the University of\u000a      Birmingham led a Policy Commission into the Future of Nuclear Energy in\u000a      the UK. The Commission has been part of a number of national processes\u000a      which have influenced and shaped UK policy and thinking in nuclear energy.\u000a      In 2013 the UK Government published its stance. Recommendations made by\u000a      the Policy Commission on key topics such as nuclear research capabilities\u000a      and national nuclear policy bodies are reflected in the Government's\u000a      report and subsequent actions.

It involves the injection with a tumour\u000d\u000a      localising drug containing boron (boron-10) and subsequently the patient\u000d\u000a      is exposed to a flux of epithermal neutrons which are scattered (reduced\u000d\u000a      in energy) and then preferentially captured by the boron. The boron-11\u000d\u000a      produced then undergoes fission efficiently, depositing a large amount of\u000d\u000a      energy within the tumour cells, destroying them.\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research undertaken by the Birmingham group has been\u000d\u000a      through identifying an effective accelerator-based neutron source (ABNS).\u000d\u000a      Without such a source, the use of the therapy would continue to be limited\u000d\u000a      to the small number of suitable nuclear research reactors. The Birmingham\u000d\u000a      Group's pioneering research has enabled and encouraged clinicians at\u000d\u000a      University Hospital Birmingham and in other countries, such as Japan,\u000d\u000a      Argentina and Israel, to progress towards the introduction of\u000d\u000a      hospital-sited BNCT treatments, developments that have extended over the\u000d\u000a      period 2008 to 2013. There is strong evidence to indicate that this\u000d\u000a      advance would not have taken place without the Birmingham Group's research\u000d\u000a      findings.\u000d\u000a    The most advanced stage of hospital-based application of BNCT has been\u000d\u000a      achieved in Japan and it has been confirmed that the first clinical trial\u000d\u000a      of the therapy using an accelerator-based neutron source began in Kyoto in\u000d\u000a      October 2012.\u000d\u000a    Contribution of Birmingham's research to the development of\u000d\u000a        accelerator-based sources: The key contribution made by researchers\u000d\u000a      at Birmingham was to demonstrate the possibility for real clinical\u000d\u000a      treatments using an accelerator-based source. This was crucial in\u000d\u000a      encouraging developments from other research groups and manufacturers\u000d\u000a      alike in different parts of the world. The initial idea of accelerator\u000d\u000a      BNCT came from Prof Jacqueline Yanch at MIT and by Prof Thomas Blue at\u000d\u000a      Ohio State University in the 1990s. However, the key to its application\u000d\u000a      was to demonstrate that these ideas were practical and this work was\u000d\u000a      performed by Prof Derek Beynon's group in Birmingham. The paper by Allen\u000d\u000a      and Beynon published in 1995 in Physics in Medicine has been cited over 50\u000d\u000a      times in the subsequent scientific literature. It was this practical\u000d\u000a      demonstration that was necessary to engage a wider clinical interest. The\u000d\u000a      paper by Culbertson et al from the Birmingham group in 2004 showed\u000d\u000a      experimental data at realistic (although still lower than desirable)\u000d\u000a      clinical beam powers. The treatment times shown in the Culbertson paper\u000d\u000a      are similar to those experienced by approximately 30 patients treated with\u000d\u000a      the reactor beam at MIT. This was a crucial step in opening up the option\u000d\u000a      of hospital-based treatment using BNCT, thereby encouraging further\u000d\u000a      clinical interest.\u000d\u000a    Importance of accelerator-based neutron sources (ABNS) in adoption of\u000d\u000a        BNCT: Assessments of the application of BNCT now acknowledge that\u000d\u000a      availability of accelerator-based sources are essential if the treatment\u000d\u000a      is to be widely applied; for instance, a recent review of 20 years'\u000d\u000a      experience of BNCT in Finland published in Physica Medica\u000d\u000a      concluded: \"... we recognise that there is no doubt that realizing\u000d\u000a        ABNS is one of the determining factors in how fast BNCT will be\u000d\u000a        established as routine clinical treatment.\" [1] A review undertaken\u000d\u000a      in 2007 for the Australian government had noted the extremely prohibitive\u000d\u000a      costs of providing the treatment if this was reliant on access to a\u000d\u000a      reactor-source. [2]\u000d\u000a    International take-up of the Birmingham findings: Currently\u000d\u000a      (2013), the most advanced stage in the hospital-based application of BNCT\u000d\u000a      is being achieved in Japan, and this progress has been explicitly\u000d\u000a      linked by the development team there to the Birmingham findings. The\u000d\u000a        first patients have now been treated (since October 2012) on the Sumiton\u000d\u000a        cyclotron system in Kyoto [3]. ,\u000d\u000a    [text removed for publication] President of the International Society for\u000d\u000a      Neutron Capture Therapy and Chairman, Department of Neurosurgery,\u000d\u000a      University of Tsukuba, has said: \"Owing to the Birmingham research\u000d\u000a        activity, several new projects on accelerator based BNCT has been\u000d\u000a        recently started. There are now three accelerator projects in Japan,\u000d\u000a        namely, KURRI with Sumitomo Heavy Industrial Co Ltd, University of\u000d\u000a        Tsukuba+KEK+JAEA with Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial Co Ltd and National\u000d\u000a        Cancer Research Center with a venture company\". [4] The construction\u000d\u000a      of these facilities was completed in 2013.\u000d\u000a    The Japanese government is investing heavily in BNCT, with a vision to\u000d\u000a      treat the most difficult cancers in a single treatment session. Gaining\u000d\u000a      high level support for such a vision requires strong clinical leadership,\u000d\u000a      which comes from some excellent clinicians in Japan, and an understanding\u000d\u000a      that what is required is actually deliverable, which comes from the\u000d\u000a      pioneering work in Birmingham. Investment is made to construct BNCT\u000d\u000a      treatment facilities in Universities, research laboratories and hospitals\u000d\u000a      across Japan. For example, in March 2013 an accelerator has been ordered\u000d\u000a      from Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd for installation in Fukushima for BNCT\u000d\u000a      treatment. The cost of construction of the BNCT facility is estimated to\u000d\u000a      be at least &#163;19M [5].\u000d\u000a    An Israeli team at the Soreq Applied Research Accelerator\u000d\u000a        Facility has reached the stage of a viable liquid lithium\u000d\u000a      accelerator target and are now constructing the accelerator facility that\u000d\u000a      will exploit this.\u000d\u000a    In Argentina efforts continue to develop a new accelerator device\u000d\u000a      to deliver BNCT which has been supported by Birmingham's work [text\u000d\u000a      removed for publication] Professor of Physics and Head Accelerator\u000d\u000a      Technology and Applications Department, Comision Nacional de Energia\u000d\u000a      Atomica has confirmed that \"the Birmingham machine has been for many\u000d\u000a        years the only one delivering an intense proton beam and hence a\u000d\u000a        sufficiently strong neutron beam to make realistic work in AB-BNCT.\u000d\u000a        This attracted our attention and finally led to a fruitful collaboration\u000d\u000a        between Birmingham and Buenos Aires around the possibility of developing\u000d\u000a        a SPECT system specifically designed for BNCT\". The results of this\u000d\u000a      work have been published by the Argentine team [6].\u000d\u000a    Clinical Work in the UK: Clinical research has focussed on the\u000d\u000a      optimisation of boron uptake in tumours. This has included clinical\u000d\u000a      research studies involving patients already undergoing treatment at the\u000d\u000a      University Hospital Birmingham. Currently, clinical studies are on-going\u000d\u000a      at the hospital into a new form of the boron carrier compound boron\u000d\u000a      phenylalanine which has been specially re-formulated for studies in\u000d\u000a      Birmingham by Cancer Research UK. While this is still a research study\u000d\u000a      with important outputs in the scientific literature (see for example Detta\u000d\u000a      and Cruickshank, Cancer Res 2009), the studies take place in the\u000d\u000a      neurosurgery theatres of University Hospital Birmingham and involve\u000d\u000a      patient volunteers. The existence of these studies show the on-going\u000d\u000a      impact of the Birmingham research through continued interest in the\u000d\u000a      various aspects necessary to eventually introduce the treatment. Without\u000d\u000a      the relationship between the Birmingham Physics Group and the University\u000d\u000a      Hospital it is doubtful that there would be active BNCT programme in the\u000d\u000a      UK.\u000d\u000a    There is a close relationship between the Birmingham Group and University\u000d\u000a      Hospital Birmingham. As a result of this collaboration, the University is\u000d\u000a      using its Dynamitron accelerator, manufactured by IBA (a Belgian company),\u000d\u000a      adapted for BNCT by the Birmingham team. This has enabled the University\u000d\u000a      to attract external support from Cancer-Research UK for the only on-going\u000d\u000a      research in Britain on the hospital-based application of BNCT. The\u000d\u000a      accelerator is currently being adapted for clinical trials.\u000d\u000a    Overall impact: The Birmingham group was the first to show\u000d\u000a      practically that it was possible to use an accelerator to produce a beam\u000d\u000a      with the necessary characteristics for these purposes. The impact has been\u000d\u000a      felt across the development community where there is now documented\u000d\u000a      acknowledgement that accelerator-based sources are part of the primary\u000d\u000a      development route for this therapy. The Birmingham research has made the\u000d\u000a      treatment economically viable and equivalent to existing radiotherapy\u000d\u000a      facilities &#8212;  which would not have been the case with a reactor based\u000d\u000a      facility. The significance of the Birmingham group's work has been in\u000d\u000a      demonstrating a practical method of using BNCT in clinical settings with\u000d\u000a      evidence set out here that this approach is now being actively applied in\u000d\u000a      a number of countries. The key beneficiaries of this research will be\u000d\u000a      patients treated with BNCT from an accelerator neutron source.

These cancers are some of the most difficult to treat and in many\u000d\u000a      cases remain incurable. In particular, efforts have focussed on the\u000d\u000a      infiltrating brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme, recurrent cancers of\u000d\u000a      the head and neck and metastatic cancers in liver, with pre-clinical work\u000d\u000a      also looking at lung cancers. For the brain tumour patients which we have\u000d\u000a      focussed upon in Birmingham, typical life expectancy after diagnosis is\u000d\u000a      around 15 months, with approximately 25% of patients surviving for 2\u000d\u000a      years. Patients with these highly infiltrating tumours gain only marginal\u000d\u000a      benefit from other advanced radiotherapy technologies such as Cyberknife\u000d\u000a      or proton\/ion beam radiotherapy.\u000d\u000a    Until the early 1990s the field of BNCT had been based exclusively around\u000d\u000a      the use of nuclear research reactors to provide an incident neutron beam\u000d\u000a      of the required characteristics (intensity, neutron spectrum, photon\u000d\u000a      contamination etc). It was initially thought that such a neutron field\u000d\u000a      could only be derived from a nuclear reactor and that this would not be\u000d\u000a      possible with an accelerator driven neutron source.\u000d\u000a    The Birmingham research set-out to harness expertise gained over many\u000d\u000a      years in nuclear and accelerator physics in order to find a way to use an\u000d\u000a      accelerator driven source, bringing their knowledge to bear on some of the\u000d\u000a      most difficult problems in cancer management.\u000d\u000a    Key outcomes of the Birmingham research effort include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      An optimised design for an accelerator BNCT facility based on neutrons\u000d\u000a        from the interaction of 2.8 MeV protons with a lithium metal target.\u000d\u000a      A design and proof of successful operation of a high power lithium\u000d\u000a        metal target where the lithium remains solid for beam-powers of the\u000d\u000a        order of 4.5kW.\u000d\u000a      Experimental data to confirm simulations at low and high beam powers,\u000d\u000a        and a demonstrated capability to deliver clinical treatments in a\u000d\u000a        possible treatment time.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Overall the Birmingham effort delivered 10 journal papers between 1995\u000d\u000a      and 2004, numerous conference papers and presentations and the completion\u000d\u000a      of 8 PhD projects. The work in Birmingham still continues with more recent\u000d\u000a      conference and journal papers, and 2 PhD students completed their projects\u000d\u000a      during 2012. All of these provide mechanisms by which the impact of the\u000d\u000a      work in Birmingham was generated.\u000d\u000a    The key researchers over this period in Birmingham were Prof T Derek\u000d\u000a      Beynon (Head of Group, retired in 2002), Dr Dennis Allen (Research Fellow,\u000d\u000a      School of Astronomy and Physics, Feb 1992 to June 2000) and Stuart Green\u000d\u000a      (Honorary Research Fellow, School of Physics and Astronomy from Feb 1993,\u000d\u000a      now Hon Professor from Feb 2011; also Clinical Scientist at University\u000d\u000a      Hospital Birmingham).

At that time, the\u000d\u000a      Oldbury station was due to cease generation in 2008, and Wylfa in 2010. As\u000d\u000a      detailed in the letter of support from Magnox [a], there was a concern\u000d\u000a      that the graphite bricks within the core of the reactor could fracture,\u000d\u000a      which might lead to an alteration in the coolant gas flow path within the\u000d\u000a      bricks, local hotspots and possibly melting of the fuel. It was\u000d\u000a      acknowledged that the reactor core was a life-limiting factor for both the\u000d\u000a      Oldbury and the Wylfa reactors. Further studies were commissioned from\u000d\u000a      Bristol by Magnox between 2007 and 2011. Confidential reports were\u000d\u000a      returned to Magnox, and some of the work was published in the open\u000d\u000a      literature to give the work an independently reviewed pedigree.\u000d\u000a    Bristol's research improved the understanding of the degradation and\u000d\u000a      fracture mechanisms of the graphite. It showed that the material is\u000d\u000a      unlikely to undergo a sudden catastrophic failure, and that instead it\u000d\u000a      behaves in a \"quasi-brittle\" way, in which failure is more graceful and\u000d\u000a      preceded by a more gradual deformation. The novel use of FIB combined with\u000d\u000a      small-scale mechanical testing to investigate this material at Bristol was\u000d\u000a      listed as a highlight in the Health and Safety Commission Nuclear Safety\u000d\u000a      Advisory Committee Review Group, dated 2 October 2007 [b].\u000d\u000a    As a result of this and other work, a safety case was constructed by\u000d\u000a      Magnox and a decision taken to extend the closure point of the Oldbury\u000d\u000a      power station from 2008 to 2012. The lifespan of the Wylfa power station,\u000d\u000a      which had been scheduled to cease operation in 2010, was also extended,\u000d\u000a      with one reactor closed in 2012 and the other operating until at least\u000d\u000a      2014.\u000d\u000a    The safety cases for the operation of nuclear power stations are\u000d\u000a      incremental, in that the lifetime of each station is continually\u000d\u000a      reassessed. End-of-life is delayed as long as it is deemed safe to do so.\u000d\u000a      At each stage, the nuclear authorities require evidence to support the\u000d\u000a      case for lifetime extension. The safety cases are reviewed by the Office\u000d\u000a      for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), an agency of the Health and Safety Executive\u000d\u000a      that oversees the process and grants consent for continued operation. In\u000d\u000a      addition, Periodic Safety Reviews (PSRs) must be carried out by the\u000d\u000a      licensee of a nuclear power plant. These provide the opportunity to\u000d\u000a      undertake a comprehensive review of plant safety, including operational\u000d\u000a      history, ageing factors and the advancement of safety standards.\u000d\u000a    A recent ONR Project Assessment Report [c] referred to the lifetime\u000d\u000a      extension for the Oldbury nuclear power station, stating: \"In support of\u000d\u000a      the graphite safety case and continued operation the licensee also carried\u000d\u000a      out a programme of work associated with the material properties of the\u000d\u000a      graphite moderator ....\". The work referred to includes that carried out\u000d\u000a      at Bristol, and as stated in the Magnox letter of support [a], \"The\u000d\u000a      research undertaken by the University of Bristol contributed to the\u000d\u000a      necessary improved understanding of how the microstructure of reactor core\u000d\u000a      graphite degrades during service and how such changes modify the\u000d\u000a      associated deformation and fracture... This information, when combined\u000d\u000a      with our other research programmes and detailed assessments, was used to\u000d\u000a      support the arguments in the Safety Cases and provided confidence to the\u000d\u000a      Regulator that Magnox was making every effort and indeed was successful in\u000d\u000a      understanding holistically how this complex material (PGA graphite)\u000d\u000a      performs in service. Indeed it allowed Oldbury to achieve 45 years'\u000d\u000a      operation and one reactor at Wylfa continues to operate.\"\u000d\u000a    The value of this life extension can be estimated by considering that\u000d\u000a      operation of a 500-megawatt power station turbine\/generator unit (roughly\u000d\u000a      the size of Oldbury) for four years generates revenue of approximately\u000d\u000a      &#163;1.7 billion for the electricity produced. Hence life extension of four\u000d\u000a      years for Oldbury and Wylfa corresponds to approximately &#163;5 billion.\u000d\u000a      Additionally, since nuclear is a low- carbon energy source, considerable\u000d\u000a      benefits to the environment are realised by life extension of the nuclear\u000d\u000a      fleet. For example, a coal-fired power station of the same output as the\u000d\u000a      combined Oldbury and Wylfa power stations operated for four years would\u000d\u000a      emit approximately 60,000,000 tonnes of CO2. The Bristol\u000d\u000a      research has therefore played a significant role in helping the UK meet\u000d\u000a      its CO2 reduction targets.\u000d\u000a    Current work at Bristol is directed at understanding the behaviour of the\u000d\u000a      graphite used in AGR reactor cores, as well as possible routes for\u000d\u000a      decommissioning [7,8,9].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Researchers at the University of Bristol's Interface Analysis Centre\u000d\u000a      played a key role in making it possible to extend the life of two nuclear\u000d\u000a      power stations.

The graphite is polygranular, porous\u000d\u000a      and quasi-brittle (i.e., the material remains brittle but behaves in a\u000d\u000a      non-linear fashion prior to macroscopic failure).\u000d\u000a    During service, the graphite reactor core is subject to an environment of\u000d\u000a      neutron irradiation and hot CO2 gas which changes the\u000d\u000a      microstructure and the mechanical and physical properties of the graphite.\u000d\u000a      The mass-loss and associated decrease in strength is monitored by\u000d\u000a      periodically removing surveillance specimens installed at commencement of\u000d\u000a      operation and samples trepanned from fuel and interstitial channel bricks.\u000d\u000a      These provide material on which to undertake a range of measurements\u000d\u000a      including porosity (weight loss) and mechanical properties.

A\u000d\u000a      range of novel, state-of-the-art experimental techniques were employed and\u000d\u000a      developed to undertake this research.\u000d\u000a    In 2002, a new materials analysis technique &#8212; a focused ion beam (FIB)\u000d\u000a      instrument &#8212; was introduced to the University of Bristol. This allowed the\u000d\u000a      machining and imaging of materials on a nanometre scale. The technique was\u000d\u000a      used here to provide high spatial resolution tomographic images of the\u000d\u000a      virgin and irradiated PGA graphite for the first time. When combined with\u000d\u000a      commercial software, it was possible to obtain 3-D representations of the\u000d\u000a      underlying pore structure to a nanometre-scale resolution [1,2]. The size,\u000d\u000a      shape and inter-connectivity of the pores was established, revealing that\u000d\u000a      the overall porosity developing over service life was both irregular in\u000d\u000a      shape and tortuous in morphology, and that the graphite assumed a skeletal\u000d\u000a      structure when highly porous.\u000d\u000a    Deformation and fracture behaviour was considered at both the macro- and\u000d\u000a      micro-scale. In general, at the macro-scale force-displacement traces\u000d\u000a      showed pre-peak non-linearity and a post-peak progressive decrease in\u000d\u000a      force [3,4]. Digital image correlation studies using flexural tests showed\u000d\u000a      macro-crack initiation involving the formation of three- to\u000d\u000a      five-millimetre-long process zones. Within such localised regions,\u000d\u000a      micro-cracks initiate and grow as a precursor to the formation of\u000d\u000a      macro-cracks. The latter propagate preferentially through the porous\u000d\u000a      matrix, but are impeded and deflected by the filler particles [4]. Detail\u000d\u000a      of the fracture mode was investigated at the micro-scale using a\u000d\u000a      combination of FIB milling and imaging, which provided new insights into\u000d\u000a      the underlying fracture mechanisms [5,6]. The research team found that a\u000d\u000a      key stage in the overall cracking mechanism was the ability of the\u000d\u000a      material to store elastic strain energy. Combined with micro-cracking, the\u000d\u000a      elastic strain energy has to achieve a critical value to allow macro-crack\u000d\u000a      formation, leading to failure of a component [6].\u000d\u000a    Key researchers\u000d\u000a    Dr. P.

The company was founded in 2001 based on the invention of the\u000a      active Q resonance control technique for atomic force microscopy (AFM).\u000a      This technique allows the effective quality-factor value to be controlled\u000a      at will through an electronic feedback system. This is important\u000a      particularly for using the AFM to image delicate samples in liquid\u000a      environments where increasing the effective Q value of the AFM cantilever\u000a      results in a considerable decrease in the force that needs to be applied\u000a      for tapping-mode imaging in liquid. The result is the capability to image,\u000a      for example, extremely delicate biomolecule samples. From 2001 to around\u000a      2005, the company sold about 50 Activ-Q units ($15k each) to customers\u000a      around the world for operation with most brands of commercial AFM\u000a      instruments. Since that time, the technique has been incorporated into\u000a      most leading commercial AFM systems including instruments from the market\u000a      leader, Bruker, as well as the other major companies in the field such as\u000a      JPK, Asylum Research, and Agilent. The AFM market is estimated to be worth\u000a      about $350 million per annum* and the active Q control technique has been\u000a      incorporated into 1000s of AFMs. *Future Markets, Inc 2011\u000a    From around 2005, the focus of Infinitesima moved to high-speed AFM\u000a      following its invention in the Nanophysics Group. Although conventional\u000a      AFM is a very versatile microscopy capable of generating 3D images up to\u000a      atomic resolution in environments from ultra-high vacuum to liquid\u000a      environments, resulting in applications from inorganic materials to living\u000a      functional biological systems, each image typically requires several\u000a      minutes to collect. The invention of the high-speed AFM by the group\u000a      opened up the possibility of video rate imaging and beyond. This is\u000a      important for following processes occurring on short timescales such as\u000a      crystallization, melting, enzyme degradation, self-assembly processes,\u000a      etc., which would otherwise be over before the first image had been\u000a      collected. High-speed AFM provides new information about, for example, the\u000a      nucleation sites and the sequence of events occurring in such processes.\u000a    Infinitesima developed commercial versions of this new type of AFM and\u000a      sold about eight instruments ($100k each) internationally to research\u000a      laboratories in both academia and industry [A]. At this point, the company\u000a      took the decision to concentrate on developing the high-speed AFM\u000a      essentially exclusively for the silicon fab applications for the review of\u000a      nanoscale defects occurring at various stage of silicon chip fabrication\u000a      on the production line. This required a high-specification version of the\u000a      high-speed AFM to meet the extreme requirements of such environments. To\u000a      achieve this focus and development, further investment, totaling &#163;7\u000a      million was acquired from ARCIntercapital [B], Sussex Place Ventures [C]\u000a      and others.\u000a    Its high-speed AFM (trade name: Rapid Probe Microscopy) has been\u000a      developed for silicon wafer defect review and eUV mask review.\u000a      Infinitesima is partnering with multi-billion dollar companies which\u000a      supply silicon device manufacturing companies such as Intel with the\u000a      manufacturing and quality control equipment [A].\u000a    Infinitesima's Rapid Probe Microscope is intended to replace scanning\u000a      electron microscopes (SEM) for the Intel's P1274 node (10 nm feature size)\u000a      scheduled for 2015. At this size scale, SEMs cause unacceptable\u000a      contamination and charging.

From the equations describing the\u000a      dynamics of an oscillating cantilever, it can be seen that higher the Q,\u000a      the quality factor, the lower the force on the sample. The idea of\u000a      actively damping an oscillation (decreasing Q) using negative feedback on\u000a      its velocity was turned around by using positive feedback to increase Q\u000a      and sharpen the resonant peak. It was applied not only for improving image\u000a      quality of soft delicate samples, but also the measurement of the complex\u000a      mechanical properties of single molecules such as the unfolding process of\u000a      protein molecules, and increasing the sensitivity of cantilever sensors\u000a      for the detection of molecules in medical samples. This active Q technique\u000a      was developed in the research group, patented [2] by the University and\u000a      the patent subsequently transferred to Infinitesima.\u000a    In 2003, the development of high-speed scanning probe microscopy began\u000a      with the invention of the high-speed scanning near-field optical\u000a      microscope which decreased the imaging time from ten of minutes to 1\/100\u000a      of a second. Using the same high-speed scan stage and high-speed data\u000a      capture hardware and software, the possibility of high-speed AFM was\u000a      explored. It was achieved through an unexpected observation that above a\u000a      certain tip speed threshold (about 1mm\/s), the tip-sample friction\u000a      suddenly decreased and to a first degree damage to the sample decreased\u000a      significantly instead of increasing with higher speed as might be\u000a      expected. Simulations and measurements now show that this is a result of a\u000a      super lubricity effect in which the tip lifts off the surface by about 1\u000a      nm at these high speeds. This led to the development in the Nanophysics\u000a      Group of high-speed AFM by Miles (Professor of Physics), Humphris (Royal\u000a      Society 1851 Fellow) and Hobbs (EPSRC Advanced Fellow) and its patenting\u000a      [3].

The patents [4,5] that\u000d\u000a      resulted from the original\u000d\u000a      work by the IAC helped Renishaw to protect this strategically important\u000d\u000a      technology and it remains\u000d\u000a      the only manufacturer of such an instrument. These instruments provide\u000d\u000a      researchers with the\u000d\u000a      means of combining two complimentary analytical techniques simultaneously\u000d\u000a      at the same\u000d\u000a      microscopic point on a sample. Conventional EDX analysis performed in an\u000d\u000a      SEM gives the simple\u000d\u000a      elemental makeup of a sample however Raman spectra acquired at the same\u000d\u000a      point can identify the\u000d\u000a      chemical bonds present and allow the researcher to positively identify\u000d\u000a      chemical compounds or\u000d\u000a      distinguish between allotropes such as Graphite and Diamond. Uses include\u000d\u000a      the identification of\u000d\u000a      contaminants in semiconductor fabrication lines and the investigation of\u000d\u000a      oxidation in reactor steel.\u000d\u000a      Renishaw does not wish to disclose commercial sales figures but sales are\u000d\u000a      of the order of\u000d\u000a      &#163;1,000,000 per year. Renishaw states* that \"Dr Day has made a\u000d\u000a        significant contribution to our\u000d\u000a        business that has enabled us to produce a novel combined technology. The\u000d\u000a        interface remains a\u000d\u000a        unique offering that is a capital item with complete systems selling for\u000d\u000a        upwards of &#163;200,000.

This product has assisted the\u000d\u000a        Spectroscopy Division of\u000d\u000a        Renishaw PLC commercially and in maintaining Renishaw's position as a\u000d\u000a        world leading supplier of\u000d\u000a        Raman spectrometers\" [A].\u000d\u000a    Rolls-Royce PLC: Rolls-Royce states* \"Our ability to\u000d\u000a        understand and manage gas turbine\u000d\u000a        products throughout the product lifecycle is a key capability which\u000d\u000a        enables us to maintain our\u000d\u000a        competitive advantage and exceed customer expectations. The work\u000d\u000a        undertaken at the University\u000d\u000a        of Bristol has been strategically supported to allow us to look at\u000d\u000a        manufacturing and material\u000d\u000a        processing. Furthermore, we are able to identify and analyse chemical\u000d\u000a        species during component\u000d\u000a        manufacture and in-service by deploying techniques in-situ. The ability\u000d\u000a        to identify and analyse\u000d\u000a        components using this technique allows feedback to enable operating\u000d\u000a        lives, product integrity and\u000d\u000a        through-life performance.\"[B]. Within the REF period, Rolls-Royce\u000d\u000a      has placed contracts to the\u000d\u000a      value of &#163;350,000 with the IAC to research and develop the application of\u000d\u000a      spectroscopic\u000d\u000a      techniques. Miniature Raman probes designed and built at the IAC have been\u000d\u000a      purchased and used\u000d\u000a      to detect and analyse contaminates within engines in situ, reducing the\u000d\u000a      need for dismantling of the\u000d\u000a      engines, which can cost &#163;300,000 per engine. In situ analyses have been\u000d\u000a      performed at the trial\u000d\u000a      stages of the Trent 900 and Trent 1000 engines. Rolls-Royce is now\u000d\u000a      commissioning a Raman\u000d\u000a      system to be included in its standard collection of inspection instruments\u000d\u000a      for field use. The work at\u000d\u000a      Bristol to analyse Thermal Paints in situ with Raman probes has resulted\u000d\u000a      in Rolls-Royce investing\u000d\u000a      in the development of paints with optimised Raman response to increase the\u000d\u000a      reliability and\u000d\u000a      sensitivity of the method. An imaging system developed at Bristol to\u000d\u000a      replace the visual tests used\u000d\u000a      to detect alumina coatings on turbine blades has resulted in a Rolls-Royce\u000d\u000a      patent application [6].\u000d\u000a    Healthcare: NISW, the NHS regional innovation hub, have\u000d\u000a      identified our miniature Raman probes\u000d\u000a      as the most promising medical device innovations from the region. NISW\u000d\u000a      states* \"These projects\u000d\u000a        form part of a small portfolio that is managed by NISW and that were\u000d\u000a        brought to the attention of\u000d\u000a        senior figures within the NHS and the MP John Glen as being flagship\u000d\u000a        examples of projects that\u000d\u000a        could yield great benefit, but were being delayed through lack of\u000d\u000a        investment and support from\u000d\u000a        within the NHS. This led to a mention in a parliamentary debate on\u000d\u000a        innovation within the NHS\u000d\u000a        (Hansard 12th October 2011: Column 98WH) and\u000d\u000a        subsequently resulted in a unique Innovation\u000d\u000a        Development Fund being provided to NISW to support the key projects (a\u000d\u000a        first within the NHS).\u000d\u000a        Subsequently, the recognition of the need to improve the support for\u000d\u000a        innovation and adoption\u000d\u000a        processes within the NHS to realise the benefits from projects such as\u000d\u000a        the Raman Probe helped to\u000d\u000a        inform the review conducted by Sir Ian Carruthers whose outcome was\u000d\u000a        enshrined in the Report `\u000d\u000a        Innovation, Health and Wealth' produced by Sir David Nicholson in\u000d\u000a        December 2011. This led to far-reaching\u000d\u000a        change and improved support at a local level within the NHS for\u000d\u000a        innovation projects. Sir\u000d\u000a        Ian Carruthers, as Chief Executive of NHS South, was the key\u000d\u000a        decision-maker in the creation of\u000d\u000a        the Innovation Development Fund and undoubtedly his awareness and\u000d\u000a        understanding of the\u000d\u000a        Raman projects helped to inform and shape some of the thinking that has\u000d\u000a        changed the approach\u000d\u000a        towards support of innovation in the NHS.\"[C].

A\u000d\u000a      pre-production prototype was built\u000d\u000a      and tested at Bristol and installed in Kochi University, Japan by Dr Day.\u000d\u000a      This prototype formed the\u000d\u000a      basis of a Renishaw product that has been commercially available since\u000d\u000a      2002.\u000d\u000a    This successful collaboration between Renishaw PLC and the IAC team of\u000d\u000a      Day and Meaden\u000d\u000a      developed further with a three year EPSRC funded project to design and\u000d\u000a      construct a miniature\u000d\u000a      fibre optic Raman probe for the endoscopic detection of cancer of the\u000d\u000a      oesophagus [1]. This project\u000d\u000a      started in September 1998, with Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and Keymed\u000d\u000a      Olympus ltd also\u000d\u000a      collaborating. This work demonstrated the possibility of cancer detection\u000d\u000a      by Raman spectroscopy\u000d\u000a      of the oesophagus and was further funded by a second award from the Health\u000d\u000a      Technology Devices\u000d\u000a      Program (Jan 05 to Oct 07). These miniature fibre optic probes continue to\u000d\u000a      be developed for\u000d\u000a      medical applications [2] and have been identified by NHS Innovations South\u000d\u000a      West (NISW), the\u000d\u000a      regional innovation hub, as the most exciting and promising medical device\u000d\u000a      innovation from the\u000d\u000a      region. Work continues at the University to bring these probes to clinical\u000d\u000a      trials. In 2011 an EPSRC\u000d\u000a      KTS award funded Dr Jo Hutchings of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHSFT to be\u000d\u000a      seconded to the\u000d\u000a      IAC. Within this collaboration 3D printing was investigated as a method of\u000d\u000a      manufacturing optical\u000d\u000a      devices and resulted in a new patent application. A &#163;0.7M NIHR i4i grant\u000d\u000a      is currently funding\u000d\u000a      collaboration between Dr Day, the University of Exeter and Gloucester\u000d\u000a      Hospital NHSFT for the\u000d\u000a      development of a needle based Raman probe for the detection of lymphomas\u000d\u000a      [3].\u000d\u000a    Miniature fibre optic Raman probes may be adapted to many diverse\u000d\u000a      applications. In an EPSRC,\u000d\u000a      ESR21 funded project in 2003, Dr Day demonstrated the use of such probes\u000d\u000a      for the analysis of\u000d\u000a      protective coatings on gas turbine blades in power stations. Raman\u000d\u000a      spectroscopy was shown to be\u000d\u000a      a valuable tool for investigating the effect of thermal cycling on the\u000d\u000a      thermal barrier coatings of\u000d\u000a      turbine blades. Following this work, Rolls-Royce PLC (R-R) has placed 15\u000d\u000a      commercial contracts\u000d\u000a      with the IAC to exploit and evaluate various aspects of this technology\u000d\u000a      for aerospace applications\u000d\u000a      and is currently sponsoring a PhD Case studentship. Work has included\u000d\u000a      studies to analyse\u000d\u000a      corrosion and contamination seen on and within ex-service components in\u000d\u000a      the lab and the design\u000d\u000a      and construction of bespoke miniature fibre optic probes, based on those\u000d\u000a      designed for cancer\u000d\u000a      detection [1,3], for analysis on wing. Uses of these probes have included\u000d\u000a      the in situ identification of\u000d\u000a      corrosion and contamination products and the measurement of thermal\u000d\u000a      paints, which change\u000d\u000a      colour depending on engine temperature. A spectroscopic imaging system for\u000d\u000a      the rapid detection\u000d\u000a      of Alumina coatings on components [6] has been developed and used at R-R\u000d\u000a      plants in Derby, East\u000d\u000a      Kilbride and Montreal. R-R continues to validate these systems to bring on\u000d\u000a      line within their plants in\u000d\u000a      the near future.\u000d\u000a    Within these projects Drs Day and Meaden developed computer programming\u000d\u000a      and machine\u000d\u000a      interfacing skills that they applied to the large array of surface science\u000d\u000a      instrumentation at the IAC.\u000d\u000a      Specifically Dr Day developed Windows based software and electronic\u000d\u000a      interfaces to replace the\u000d\u000a      diverse range of computer control systems then available on SEMs and SIMS,\u000d\u000a      Auger and XPS\u000d\u000a      spectrometers within the department. This provided a standardised software\u000d\u000a      interface for the\u000d\u000a      machines in the IAC, which became increasingly in demand by other\u000d\u000a      laboratories.\u000d\u000a      Dr Meaden further developed his ideas on strain measurement using Raman\u000d\u000a      and EBSD and\u000d\u000a      helped supervise a PhD project on the technique. This work drew on the\u000d\u000a      original research of Prof\u000d\u000a      David Dingley in the Bristol Physics department. Dr Meaden left the IAC in\u000d\u000a      2003 and, in close\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Prof. Dingley formed BLG Productions to further develop\u000d\u000a      the skills and ideas\u000d\u000a      conceived at the University of Bristol. Dr Meaden is currently a Visiting\u000d\u000a      Fellow at the IAC and\u000d\u000a      continues to collaborate with the IAC on testing his company's products.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40248","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Linking the research to impact\u000d\u000a      Raman thermography technology developed at Bristol was made available to\u000d\u000a      UK, European, US and Asian companies to characterize their semiconductor\u000d\u000a      electronic devices, from 2007 onwards. The companies were made aware of\u000d\u000a      the new technique developed at Bristol at European Space Agency (ESA) &#8212;\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Defense (MoD) workshops in Europe, CS-Mantech in the USA and\u000d\u000a      other industry meetings. As result of this, measurements were performed in\u000d\u000a      Bristol on 100s of industry supplied devices, paid by industry (total in\u000d\u000a      excess of &#163;200k), to thermally optimize device structures, determine\u000d\u000a      device lifetime, and ultimately for the qualification of new technology to\u000d\u000a      fulfil industry and\/or military standards to generate industrial impact.\u000d\u000a      This work also resulted in a patent [A].\u000d\u000a    Nature, extent and beneficiaries of the impact\u000d\u000a      The research enabled companies to develop more robust, reliable, higher\u000d\u000a      performing devices and circuits for high-end space, radar and\u000d\u000a      communication applications, in particular using GaN and GaAs technology.\u000d\u000a      Channel temperatures determined on the devices were correlated against\u000d\u000a      device failure rates, to predict device lifetime. The results were used by\u000d\u000a      the companies to optimize processing and device design for enabling better\u000d\u000a      and more reliable devices. Typically lifetimes of these devices in the\u000d\u000a      early stage of our interaction with the companies were in the 1000s of\u000d\u000a      hours, however, at least 106 hours in many cases 109\u000d\u000a      hours are needed for most commercial applications which most companies we\u000d\u000a      work with now achieve.\u000d\u000a    A typical example of how this technology has been implemented by industry\u000d\u000a      is United Monolithic Semiconductor (UMS), a joint venture between THALES\u000d\u000a      (France) and EADS GmbH (Germany) [B]. UMS is seen by European defence and\u000d\u000a      Space agencies and companies as the European supplier of US International\u000d\u000a      Traffics and Arms Regulation (ITAR) free GaN technology, as the export of\u000d\u000a      GaN technology from the US is heavily restricted.\u000d\u000a    Dr. H. Blanck from UMS states [B]: \"As a result of these channel\u000d\u000a        temperature measurements we were able to freeze and qualify our GaN\u000d\u000a        technology, in addition support the further development of our current\u000d\u000a        commercial GaAs products, also providing customers with device\u000d\u000a        implementation critical technology information\", ie UMS was able to\u000d\u000a      implement defined new production processes (`freeze') that are now used\u000d\u000a      for providing commercial GaN devices and circuits, which meet the needed\u000d\u000a      reliability criteria, and to support GaAs customer needs. There is no\u000d\u000a      other experimental technique other than Raman thermography available that\u000d\u000a      can achieve the required accuracy in channel temperature information for\u000d\u000a      the qualification of GaN and GaAs technology [C].\u000d\u000a    Similar work to characterize channel temperature in semiconductor devices\u000d\u000a      was carried out for TriQuint (USA) [D], Selex Galileo (UK &amp; Italy)\u000d\u000a      [E], furthermore for Thales Alenia Spaciale (France), NXP (UK &amp;\u000d\u000a      Netherlands), QinetiQ (UK), Northrop Grumman (USA), Sharp (Japan) and\u000d\u000a      Hitachi Cable (Japan). Raman thermography was for example used by TriQuint\u000d\u000a      USA in 2010 [D] to validate its thermal simulation models to enable\u000d\u000a      accurate channel temperature quantification for its GaN technology, to\u000d\u000a      enable its commercial GaN technology development. It also was used to\u000d\u000a      enable the development of the TriQuint GaN-diamond integrated transistor\u000d\u000a      in 2012\/2013 which featured in recent TriQuint and DARPA press releases\u000d\u000a      [F] developed for high end US defense applications.\u000d\u000a    Due to the uniqueness of the Bristol developed equipment, the\u000d\u000a      measurements were performed in the laboratories of the University of\u000d\u000a      Bristol, with devices sent by the companies or in cases Research &amp;\u000d\u000a      Development engineers of the companies travelled with the devices to\u000d\u000a      Bristol due to their sensitive nature (including from the USA). The\u000d\u000a      University of Bristol is in process of licensing the IP of Raman\u000d\u000a      thermography to the semiconductor equipment manufacturer Quantum Focus\u000d\u000a      Instruments (QFI), San Diego, USA, also to develop a low cost version of\u000d\u000a      the Raman thermography system.\u000d\u000a    Evidence to corroborate the impact\u000d\u000a      UMS states [B] \"For reasons of commercial confidentiality it is not\u000d\u000a        possible to give sales figures or any equivalent. However, I can confirm\u000d\u000a        that UMS have invested significantly in commercialising the GaN\u000d\u000a        technology, and that it now forms a strategic part of our business\u000d\u000a        generating significant revenue. In addition, GaAs RF technology already\u000d\u000a        is a large part of our sales figures. The technology developed at the\u000d\u000a        University of Bristol and its use on our technology significantly\u000d\u000a        benefited us financially. In 2009, the headcount at UMS was 255 people,\u000d\u000a        for sales of 47M&#8364;.\"\u000d\u000a    It is clear that the work done at Bristol has enabled the company to\u000d\u000a      enter the GaN market earlier than would otherwise have been possible,\u000d\u000a      giving it a competitive advantage over its rivals.\u000d\u000a    As due to confidential reasons sales figures can not be disclosed by UMS,\u000d\u000a      the large commercial impact of the Bristol development for UMS is\u000d\u000a      demonstrated by its willingness to directly pay for contract measurements\u000d\u000a      on their devices in Bristol. These measurements were performed on a daily\u000d\u000a      rate charge basis of &#163;1200 + VAT, typically within 3-5 measurement days in\u000d\u000a      each measurement campaign. UMS states [B] \"our direct financial\u000d\u000a        contribution to the University of Bristol for contract measurements well\u000d\u000a        exceeded &#163;50,000, in addition to the direct benefits to us from\u000d\u000a        measurements performed by Bristol on our technology paid to Bristol by\u000d\u000a        ESA under the GREAT2 contracts, and by the\u000d\u000a        European Defence Agency (EDA) under the MANGA (manufacturable GaN)\u000d\u000a        contract.\" Direct UMS contract measurements were performed 2007 -\u000d\u000a      present.

As critical device\u000d\u000a      dimensions in this semiconductor technology range from the sub-micron to\u000d\u000a      only a few micron range, accurate temperature measurements with sub-micron\u000d\u000a      resolutions is essential. This, however, has not been achievable with\u000d\u000a      current common thermography techniques such as infra-red thermography with\u000d\u000a      its only many micron spatial resolution.\u000d\u000a    In 2002 [1] Prof. Kuball's group demonstrated that Raman scattering\u000d\u000a      spectroscopy can be applied to measure channel temperature in these and\u000d\u000a      other semiconductor devices with sub-micron spatial resolution throughout\u000d\u000a      the device structure [2].\u000d\u000a    The technique of Raman thermography developed in Bristol is fundamentally\u000d\u000a      based on the fact that the energy of atomic lattice vibrations, so-called\u000d\u000a      phonons, in the semiconductor is dependent on the device temperature.\u000d\u000a      Temperature can therefore be determined with 0.5 micron resolution by\u000d\u000a      measuring changes in phonon frequencies between when a device is switched\u000d\u000a      on and off. Such spatial resolution can be achieved using standard\u000d\u000a      microscope objectives, if even smaller dimensions (100-300nm) are\u000d\u000a      required, then solid immersion lenses can be employed.\u000d\u000a    A key challenge in the development of the Raman thermography technique\u000d\u000a      was the separation of temperature effects and stress\/strain effects that\u000d\u000a      influence the phonon energy in the semiconductor devices [3]. This\u000d\u000a      involved gaining a detailed understanding of how temperature and\u000d\u000a      stress\/strain affect phonon modes, and how this can be taken advantage of\u000d\u000a      in a semiconductor device context. This understanding was used to develop\u000d\u000a      the technique to accurately quantify channel temperature in semiconductor\u000d\u000a      devices, and also heat transfer across interfaces inside the semiconductor\u000d\u000a      devices, including the impact of material imperfections such as\u000d\u000a      dislocations [4]. This also included the implementation of the ability to\u000d\u000a      measure temperature transients in semiconductor devices with nanosecond\u000d\u000a      time resolution, which is essential both for microwave and for power\u000d\u000a      switching devices [5].

As demonstrated by the three examples, the IAC has broad reach,\u000a      connecting with national and international partners. All efforts translate\u000a      detailed, focused scientific research into tangible outputs and advice for\u000a      the industry. Our advice has been taken up by both the AWE and Sellafield\u000a      and this has led to changes to protocols, be it from changing the way\u000a      uranium (and daughter products) are stored (i.e. the safest environmental\u000a      conditions or storage configurations) through to improved understanding of\u000a      the reactive chemistry of uranium in different possible storage\u000a      environments. For CERN we have not only provided underpinning research but\u000a      we have also developed and implemented, from scratch, a processing route\u000a      for fission target wastes.\u000a    Beneficiaries of impact\u000a      The nuclear industry, including the AWE, CERN and Sellafield in particular\u000a      have performed extensive programmes of targeted research work to assess\u000a      the corrosion of uranium in conditions which reflect those which are\u000a      expected to present in the storage areas. For the AWE, the data feeds\u000a      directly into the programme for the safe storage, maintenance and\u000a      management of the UK's nuclear deterrent. For Sellafiled, the data feeds\u000a      directly into programmes of work for the retrieval and treatment of the\u000a      legacy wastes.\u000a    Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE)\u000a      The AWE plays a crucial role in the defence of the United Kingdom,\u000a      responsible for the manufacture and maintenance of warheads for Trident, a\u000a      submarine-launched ballistic missile. Since 2004, the AWE has collaborated\u000a      closely with the IAC, Bristol in relation to research directed at better\u000a      understanding and predicting the corrosion of uranium and its alloys. To\u000a      date, research has been primarily focused on determining the factors\u000a      influencing the initiation of hydrogen corrosion on uranium surfaces. This\u000a      research has had a direct feed-through to the safe storage of uranium and\u000a      associated materials within the MoD estate, considered to account for a\u000a      significant proportion of the operational cost of Trident and the cost of\u000a      running Aldermaston (AWE expenditure between 2008 and 2011 was about\u000a      &#163;2.6bn)[d].\u000a    \"Over the past 9 years, extensive experience and valuable data\u000a        relating to the corrosion of uranium metal has been accumulated by the\u000a        Bristol group. This knowledge has furthered our understanding of some\u000a        uranium corrosion processes (particularly the reaction between uranium\u000a        and hydrogen) and helped to validate and quantify some important\u000a        predictive uranium corrosion models developed at AWE. For example, the\u000a        fundamental relationship between oxide thickness and the severity of\u000a        hydride attack, which is an underlying mechanistic assumption within\u000a        several corrosion models applied at the AWE, was directly verified by\u000a        Bristol in a 2006 technical report. The use of such models enables\u000a        corrosion predictions which are used unequivocally to reduce the need\u000a        for physical examination, intervention and measurements of stored\u000a        materials; all of which account for a heavy financial burden on the UK\u000a        Government.\"[a]\u000a    The potential magnitude of the problems being addressed by Bristol are\u000a      best coined by a further quote from the AWE: \"The storage of uranium in\u000a        all but the driest of atmospheres can inevitably lead to the generation\u000a        of hydrogen gas and the later formation of uranium hydride. This\u000a        presents serious safety hazards during the long term or even medium-term\u000a        storage of metallic waste (prior to eventual treatment\/disposal) with\u000a        explosions and fires being a risk on the eventual exposure of the\u000a        payload to the atmosphere.\"[a].\u000a    Consequently although no specific details may be supplied, the AWE are\u000a      strongly voiced in their opinion that The \"contribution to the AWE\u000a        [from Bristol], and by association the UK, has been significant and much\u000a        needed.\"\u000a    Sellafield Ltd (SL)\u000a      One of the primary missions of the Sellafield Site is the\u000a      characterisation, retrieval, treatment and safe interim above ground\u000a      storage of the legacy wastes which were produced from the earlier\u000a      operations of the UK nuclear industry. These waste streams contain\u000a      substantial quantities of uranium metal (from spent nuclear fuel) along\u000a      with components of the fuel cladding such as Magnox and aluminium. The\u000a      wastes have been stored under conditions which have lead to the formation\u000a      of corrosion products such that their characteristics are expected to be\u000a      significantly different from those of the materials originally consigned\u000a      to the plants for storage. Unanswered questions pertaining to the state of\u000a      uranium in storage are key to the safe retrieval and treatment of the\u000a      legacy wastes [b].\u000a    Whilst the research relationship between Bristol and SL. is relatively\u000a      new, the technical input provided to date, has had a positive influence on\u000a      several Sellafield programmes which predate the formation of the link,\u000a      providing late-stage but valuable supporting data and expert advice that\u000a      have reinforced and influenced decisions relating to waste retrieval and\u000a      treatment programmes' such as Magnox swarf storage silos (MSSS), the silos\u000a      direct encapsulation plant etc. The Bristol research has allowed SL to \"better\u000a        predict the current state and residual reactivity of uranium and\u000a        reactive metal bearing wastes across a number of the legacy plants on\u000a        the Sellafield site\".\u000a    More specifically, SL (and by association the National Nuclear Laboratory\u000a      who are performing the package of experimental work for Sellafield) has\u000a      used the specialist uranium research facilities at the University of\u000a      Bristol to perform contract measurements (ongoing since April 2012) in\u000a      relation to determining the proportions of alpha- and beta-UH3\u000a      forming at different temperatures and formation rates [b].\u000a    We recommended to SL that spent uranium fuel should be stored in a\u000a      semi-dry and open containment system such that the potential for\u000a      significant hydrogen accumulation is prevented. SL has contracted the UK\u000a      company Croft Ltd to manufacture a series of test storage casks, to\u000a      provide a full-scale demonstration of such a storage concept. SL has so\u000a      far investing approx. &#163;1M in this project.\u000a    The work on hydride formation has affected the SL safety case for\u000a      recovery of legacy wastes by reducing uncertainty in quantifying the risk\u000a      associated with the occurrence of thermal excursions. We have helped to\u000a      confirm that there is not a significant safety issue posed by uranium\u000a      hydride in the recovery of legacy waste from SL storage silos. SL is now\u000a      continuing with the MSSS (&#163;387M) and other legacy retrieval projects\u000a      including the solis direct encapsulation plant (&#163;1.28B) and pile fuel\u000a      cladding silo project (&#163;341M); projects worth a total of ~&#163;1.9 billion\u000a      [e]. Our work on encapsulation of uranium metal in cement (using\u000a      synchrotron X-rays) has proven that hydride can be a developing corrosion\u000a      product. SL will use this information to inform its safety case for waste\u000a      encapsulation. Correspondingly our research has had \"a direct bearing\u000a        on UK national level programmes for the safe and cost effective\u000a        remediation of the Sellafield site\" [b].\u000a    CERN (ISOLDE Facility).\u000a      The safe disposal of radioactive waste arising from experimental fission\u000a      studies at CERN is a key objective for the organisation; \"As a\u000a        by-product of our experimental activities at the ISOLDE on-line isotope\u000a        mass separator facility, the site has a stockpile of spent uranium and\u000a        thorium carbide targets from which we have produced fission product\u000a        gases. These wastes have historically been stored on site and have\u000a        gradually accumulated, awaiting the development of a suitable processing\u000a        route for conversion of the material into a waste form that is\u000a        acceptable to the Swiss authorities\" [c]. In 2010, CERN instigated\u000a      IAC funding for a 2-year research project to develop a process for the\u000a      controlled chemical conversion of their uranium carbide fission targets\u000a      into an acceptable waste form. Scott's research has solved this specific\u000a      problem; \"It is considered that the work conducted by Dr Scott and his\u000a        team has allowed us to develop and implement (from scratch) a processing\u000a        route for our radioactive fission target wastes. This has had a direct\u000a        and positive bearing on the operations at the ISOLDE facility and at\u000a        CERN in general\" [c]. This method for processing ISOLDE fission\u000a      wastes has \"constituted the building of a specialist\u000a        hot-cell facility for handling waste targets and a gas treatment system\u000a        for converting the targets. This investment was in the order of 1.4\u000a        million Euros\" [c]. Indirect beneficiaries of this programme\u000a      includes other EU research facilities such as the SPIRAL2 project at\u000a      GANIL, Caen, France and the SPES project at INFN, Italy. According to\u000a      CERN: \"Members of these facilities are already enquiring about the\u000a        work done by the University of Bristol in order to assume the\u000a        elimination pathway of their actinide material\".\u000a    Other indirect beneficiaries include the UK public and the US public\u000a      through trans-Atlantic sharing of information between AWE and the\u000a      Department of Defence. Impact, as a pull-through, is garnered through the\u000a      uptake of advice and change to protocols; be it from changing the way\u000a      uranium and uranium carbide are stored or processed through to improved\u000a      understanding of the reactive chemistry of uranium in different possible\u000a      storage environments.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at the University of Bristol's Interface Analysis Centre has\u000a      been used to make storage of uranium and uranium carbide safer.\u000a    Our research into uranium corrosion has been used to predict the state of\u000a      uranium present in `intolerable' legacy wastes at Sellafield and has\u000a      shaped the way that Sellafield Ltd intends to safely recover and repackage\u000a      it for prolonged storage.

Scott, Professor Geoff Allen and their interdisciplinary research\u000a      unit based in the School of Physics, the Interface Analysis Centre (IAC),\u000a      have been working closely with the nuclear industry on prediction and\u000a      assessment of risks for storage of nuclear waste &#8212; specifically uranium.\u000a      Scott joined Physics in 2009 and became the IAC director in 2009 (a\u000a      position which he still holds at present), taking over from Allen who had\u000a      founded and directed the IAC from 1989 onwards (and has since stayed as an\u000a      emeritus Professor of Materials Science and academic coordinator for the\u000a      Bristol-AWE strategic partnership). Their research focuses on different\u000a      aspects of uranium research from metallurgy and alloying through to\u000a      corrosion and environmental geochemistry [1-6]. A significant spotlight\u000a      has been on establishing the mechanisms that control uranium corrosion,\u000a      from initiation to cessation [1,3,5]. A primary focus has been on\u000a      understanding the corrosion of uranium in storage environments containing\u000a      varying quantities of hydrogen alongside other gases. The resulting\u000a      corrosion product &#8212; uranium hydride (UH3) is pyrophoric and\u000a      consequently poses a significant operational safety risk in almost all\u000a      storage environments.\u000a    This work has enabled identification and better understanding of many of\u000a      the significant factors controlling the onset (initiation) of hydride\u000a      formation, including the influence of different cover gases, micro-scale\u000a      anomalies in the metal itself and structure of the protective surface\u000a      oxide layer [1,2,5]. This understanding has allowed better prediction of\u000a      when and if hydrogen corrosion will occur and to implement preventative\u000a      measures that will delay or even prevent such an occurrence [2]. As an\u000a      inherent impurity in the metal, uranium carbide has also been studied in\u000a      our corrosion research in relation to (i) how it offsets apparent\u000a      corrosion rates of the parent metal [3] and (ii) methods for its\u000a      deliberate and controlled oxidation [4].\u000a    The approach to research has been to combined sophisticated surface\u000a      analysis techniques with specialist isotope-spiked corrosion cells in\u000a      which the storage environment (pressure, temperature &amp; gas\u000a      composition) is precisely controlled and monitored to provide not only\u000a      real-time corrosion. Of additional significance is that we have also been\u000a      able to determine the actual mechanisms of uranium corrosion,\u000a      demonstrating that in mixed gas atmospheres containing both oxygen and\u000a      water vapour (e.g. air), the latter is the driver for corrosion, with the\u000a      surface oxide facilitating the concurrent combination of released hydrogen\u000a      with free oxygen to form `new' water. A strong recommendation from our\u000a      research is that uranium is best stored in an environment where\u000a      significant accumulation of hydrogen gas may be prevented.\u000a    The Interface Analysis Centre is recognised as world-leading in the field\u000a      of uranium research, to the extent that Sellafield Ltd, through the\u000a      auspices of the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) nominated the\u000a      University as both a Centre of Excellence and a strategic partner.\u000a    Over the current REF period, uranium research funding to the IAC group\u000a      has exceeded &#163;1.5M, coming from the AWE, CERN and Sellafield, in addition\u000a      to Research Council funding as part of consortia projects on nuclear\u000a      materials (e.g. EP\/I003207\/1 and EP\/I003207\/1). The Centre has produced\u000a      some 14 technical reports, in support of the AWE activity, 2 in support of\u000a      Sellafield Ltd and 5 in support of CERN.\u000a    The Bristol-AWE partnership was formalised in 2009, with the\u000a      establishment of a strategic alliance agreement that was instigated in\u000a      response to a broadening IAC research activity with the company [a]. In\u000a      2010, the IAC was funded by CERN for a 2-year research project to develop\u000a      a process for the controlled chemical conversion of their uranium carbide\u000a      fission targets into an acceptable waste form [c]\u000a    In 2011, Sellafield Ltd embarked on a national search to identify and\u000a      evaluate academic expertise related to the corrosion of uranium and other\u000a      reactive metals. The reason for this search was to establish a Sellafield\u000a      sponsored link between the internal SL Centre of Expertise (CoE) on\u000a      Uranium and Reactive Metals and a suitably qualified UK University that\u000a      would provide expert advice and research to support Sellafield\u000a      particularly in relation to the behaviour of uranium in wastes [c].\u000a    During this period, the IAC was identified as having a `substantial and\u000a      leading international expertise for research on uranium and its corrosion\u000a      products', `accumulated over a period of approximately 10 years in close\u000a      collaboration with the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE)'.\u000a    Subsequently in early 2012, after a national tendering process, Bristol\u000a      was successfully awarded the CoE-university link. Sellafield have\u000a      acknowledged that the IAC's prior research conducted with the AWE\u000a      `directly impacted the company's decision on which University to work\u000a      with' and gained &#163;500K direct funding from the company over a 5 year\u000a      period.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40530","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact came about via an existing collaboration between Dr Doran and\u000d\u000a      two colleagues in the\u000d\u000a      Radiation Physics Group, Dr. Walter Gilboy (Senior Lecturer, now retired)\u000d\u000a      and Dr. Paul Jenneson\u000d\u000a      (Lecturer), both of whom were long-standing supporters of the optical CT\u000d\u000a      programme. Both had\u000d\u000a      industrial contacts through previous collaborations with Nexia Solutions\u000d\u000a      (which later became the\u000d\u000a      NNL). The team envisaged the application of gel dosimetry in the area of\u000d\u000a      remote monitoring of\u000d\u000a      radiation levels in hazardous environments, rather than its original\u000d\u000a      application in medical physics.\u000d\u000a      Encouraging research results at Surrey were the basis for a patent\u000d\u000a      application for a radiation\u000d\u000a      detector [Corroboration reference C1], with Stanley at NNL and Doran and\u000d\u000a      Jenneson at Surrey\u000d\u000a      being the named inventors.\u000d\u000a    The initial shape of the dosimeter was cylindrical, and Nexia wished to\u000d\u000a      optimise this\u000d\u000a      configuration. To achieve the optimisation, in 2007 Doran carried out\u000d\u000a      computer simulations and\u000d\u000a      explained the implications of using different materials and collimator\u000d\u000a      thicknesses on the contrast\u000d\u000a      achieved in the detector gel. Encouraged by developments, Nexia developed\u000d\u000a      a revised polymer\u000d\u000a      shape and surrounding collimator, in collaboration with dosimeter\u000d\u000a      manufacturer Heuris Pharma\u000d\u000a      LLC. In collaboration with NNL in 2009, Doran evaluated the first\u000d\u000a      incarnation of the new RadBall&#174;\u000d\u000a      design [C2]. The green spherical sample created by Dr Doran in this phase\u000d\u000a      of development has\u000d\u000a      proved iconic: it was used widely by NNL in its publicity (e.g., slides 13\u000d\u000a      and 14 of reference [C3])\u000d\u000a      and on the polymer manufacturer's homepage (www.presage3d.com),\u000d\u000a      where the Surrey laboratory\u000d\u000a      and key researchers also feature prominently. The results from this phase\u000d\u000a      supplemented the\u000d\u000a      original Surrey research and resulted in a second patent application [C4].\u000d\u000a    The research undertaken at Surrey has led to NNL's development of a\u000d\u000a      commercial dosimeter,\u000d\u000a      known as RadBall&#174;, which has a clear advantage in being portable,\u000d\u000a      non-electrical, simple to use,\u000d\u000a      and able to be remotely operated. Prior to radiation exposure, the ball of\u000d\u000a      polymer initially is\u000d\u000a      translucent, and it becomes increasingly opaque upon exposure to\u000d\u000a      radiation, in proportion to the\u000d\u000a      dose. The direction of the opaque tracks in the ball shows the position of\u000d\u000a      the source, and the\u000d\u000a      change in the tracks' opacity indicates the source's activity. The polymer\u000d\u000a      sphere is then imaged in\u000d\u000a      an optical-CT scanner to relate the opacity to the received radiation\u000d\u000a      dose.\u000d\u000a    A key impact of the research is the change in practice in nuclear\u000d\u000a      decommissioning brought\u000d\u000a      about by adoption of the RadBall&#174; technology. RadBall&#174; is being used by\u000d\u000a      NNL at Sellafield in the\u000d\u000a      former reprocessing building, where radioactive waste is contained in\u000d\u000a      cells, which are small solidly-constructed\u000d\u000a      rooms. Decommissioners are clearing out the so-called \"legacy waste\"\u000d\u000a      accumulated\u000d\u000a      from years of nuclear energy and weapons production. The RadBall&#174;\u000d\u000a      dosimeters are placed within\u000d\u000a      radioactive cells either directly by workers or remotely through robots\u000d\u000a      and cranes. The radiation\u000d\u000a      levels can be mapped out, and sources of radiation can be identified, so\u000d\u000a      as to facilitate the\u000d\u000a      decommissioning process.\u000d\u000a    The technology thus has an impact on the safety of radiation workers, and\u000d\u000a      it provides protection\u000d\u000a      to the general public in the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. A\u000d\u000a      nuclear engineer at Sellafield\u000d\u000a      explains the benefits of RadBall's portability [C5]: \"You can use it\u000d\u000a        in hard-to-reach areas in the\u000d\u000a        plant and in areas where electric devices struggle with high radiation\u000d\u000a        levels. It tells us where the\u000d\u000a        hazards are and how severe they are.\"\u000d\u000a    Linking the impact of RadBall&#174; to the Surrey research, a Business Manager\u000d\u000a      (Instrumentation\u000d\u000a      and In-situ Analysis) and Intellectual Property Manager from NNL [C6]\u000d\u000a      says: \"Working with the\u000d\u000a        University of Surrey provided the National Nuclear Laboratory with\u000d\u000a        access to valuable and\u000d\u000a        essential expertise which proved to be a critical factor with regards to\u000d\u000a        the development of the\u000d\u000a        technology.\"\u000d\u000a    From 2010 onwards, impact from the research continued when NNL\u000d\u000a      established a strategic\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the USA Department of Energy. They tested RadBall first\u000d\u000a      at the Savannah River\u000d\u000a      National Laboratory and then at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A large\u000d\u000a      team, supported\u000d\u000a      through significant investment, has been developing a robotic solution for\u000d\u000a      deployment of the\u000d\u000a      device. A first set of tests at Savannah River's Health Physics Instrument\u000d\u000a      Calibration Laboratory\u000d\u000a      used gamma-ray and X-ray sources to identify the optimal dose and\u000d\u000a      collimator thickness. Then,\u000d\u000a      tests at the Shielded Cells facility employed RadBall&#174; to\u000d\u000a      characterise cells containing\u000d\u000a      contamination from unknown radiation sources. In this milestone\u000d\u000a      development, a 3D visualisation\u000d\u000a      of the radiation within the cell was obtained.\u000d\u000a    Numerous reports on the outcomes that have flowed from this research at\u000d\u000a      Savannah River\u000d\u000a      have appeared, and plans have been articulated for testing a robot for\u000d\u000a      remote RadBall&#174;\u000d\u000a      deployment into highly contaminated facilities [C7]. The University of\u000d\u000a      Surrey's vital research\u000d\u000a      contribution to the origin of the RadBall&#174; technology is\u000d\u000a      spelled out in a recently-published history in\u000d\u000a      an NNL technical report [C8].\u000d\u000a    In the past few years, there has been an increasingly high public profile\u000d\u000a      for the project, with\u000d\u000a      stories run in both the popular press (e.g. the BBC) [C5] and in\u000d\u000a      U.S. governmental reports [C9]. As\u000d\u000a      a testimony to the significance of the technology, it has been awarded the\u000d\u000a      IChemE Award for\u000d\u000a      Innovation and Excellence in Health and Safety.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Surrey's Radiation and Medical Physics Group developed\u000d\u000a      a technique used in\u000d\u000a      radiotherapy applications in medicine and have played a significant role\u000d\u000a      in extending its application\u000d\u000a      to environmental nuclear decontamination. The key concept is to use\u000d\u000a      polymeric gels as direct\u000d\u000a      detectors of radiation to show visually the regions where radiation is\u000d\u000a      being concentrated and the\u000d\u000a      direction from which it comes. Two Surrey research contracts with the\u000d\u000a      National Nuclear Laboratory\u000d\u000a      (NNL) culminated in the creation of a commercial radiation dosimeter known\u000d\u000a      as the RadBall,&#174;\u000d\u000a      which offers the advantages of being portable, non-electrical, simple to\u000d\u000a      use, and able to be\u000d\u000a      remotely operated.

Initial work was performed by Dr Simon Doran (Surrey\u000d\u000a      lecturer from 1995-2006,\u000d\u000a      now at the Institute of Cancer Research and Visiting Senior Fellow at the\u000d\u000a      University), with two PhD\u000d\u000a      students and an Erasmus student (Hepworth, Bero and Koerkamp). This\u000d\u000a      research led to well-cited\u000d\u000a      outputs on the characterisation of so-called \"gel dosimeters\" [1] and to\u000d\u000a      one of the seminal papers\u000d\u000a      on optical computed tomography (CT) scanning of gel dosimeters [2]. Simply\u000d\u000a      stated, the optical\u000d\u000a      properties of a gel dosimeter change as a result of irradiation. Optical\u000d\u000a      scanning of irradiated gels is\u000d\u000a      then used to determine the radiation dose as a function of position in 3D\u000d\u000a      space. Doran followed\u000d\u000a      these initial investigations by a research programme that developed the\u000d\u000a      methodology of optical CT\u000d\u000a      gel dosimetry [3] through the PhD research of Nikola Krstaji&#263;. They\u000d\u000a      successfully patented the\u000d\u000a      design of scanners used in the research [4]. They employed these scanners\u000d\u000a      to characterise\u000d\u000a      polymer gel samples in the later research activities that resulted\u000d\u000a      directly in the impact.\u000d\u000a    The direct origin of the main impact was an experimental project,\u000d\u000a      undertaken by an MSc\u000d\u000a      physics student (Prott) with Dr Doran as supervisor. The subject for the\u000d\u000a      dissertation had been\u000d\u000a      suggested by Dr Paul Jenneson (Surrey lecturer in Physics) after\u000d\u000a      discussions with Dr Steven\u000d\u000a      Stanley (Nexia Solutions). The idea for the project was to surround a\u000d\u000a      sample of a newly-developed\u000d\u000a      radiochromic polymer, known commercially as PRESAGE&#174;, with a lead sheath\u000d\u000a      containing an array\u000d\u000a      of holes. This object was then placed in a radiation field, which would\u000d\u000a      lead to a set of \"rays\" being\u000d\u000a      transmitted through the holes. Exposure of the polymer to radiation\u000d\u000a      changes its colour in a way\u000d\u000a      that could be scanned in 3-D, using the optical tomography apparatus\u000d\u000a      previously developed by\u000d\u000a      Doran's group. They envisaged that inverse ray tracing could be used to\u000d\u000a      calculate the position of\u000d\u000a      the radiation sources to which the sample had been exposed, whereas the\u000d\u000a      extent of the colour\u000d\u000a      change could be used to determine the dose-rate of the source, given a\u000d\u000a      suitable calibration. The\u000d\u000a      Surrey team carried out the world's first optical CT scan of the\u000d\u000a      radiochromic polymer PRESAGE&#174;.\u000d\u000a      This material is a key component of RADBALL&#174;, the commercial product that\u000d\u000a      has produced the\u000d\u000a      main impact. The successful research results were first published in an\u000d\u000a      MSc dissertation in 2007\u000d\u000a      and presented at the DOSGEL 2008 conference, before appearing in a journal\u000d\u000a      [5].\u000d\u000a    The original intended target of this research was in the field of medical\u000d\u000a      physics, where 3-D\u000d\u000a      radiation dosimetry is used for the verification of complex radiotherapy\u000d\u000a      treatments. Doran has led a\u000d\u000a      programme of applications of 3-D gel dosimetry in medicine [6]. Surrey\u000d\u000a      contributions to the field are\u000d\u000a      outlined in two major and heavily-cited reviews [7,8] charting the\u000d\u000a      developments over more than a\u000d\u000a      decade.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40531","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Nuclear Physics Group's world-leading research on the structure of\u000a      exotic nuclei and expertise\u000a      in techniques, such as gamma-ray spectroscopy, has led to a wide range of\u000a      public engagement\u000a      activities and media work, which have raised their impact far beyond the\u000a      confines of the\u000a      international nuclear physics community.\u000a    Much of the impact of the Group's research has derived from their being\u000a      world-leading\u000a      authorities on nuclear and radiation issues. For example, when news of the\u000a      Fukushima nuclear\u000a      incident broke in March 2011, Professor Regan and colleagues were called\u000a      upon to take part in\u000a      more than 50 TV and radio interviews by discussing the measurement and\u000a      biological effects of\u000a      radiation. Regan made a number of appearances on BBC Breakfast News and\u000a      BBC World News,\u000a      both of which have a viewership of millions [see Section 5, Source S1].\u000a      They informed the public\u000a      by drawing on information provided by research results, such as the\u000a      characterisation of radioactive\u000a      isotopes using gamma-ray spectroscopy (ref. 1). Six months later, Prof.\u000a      Al-Khalili presented a\u000a      Horizon programme filmed in Fukushima, entitled `Is Nuclear Power Safe?',\u000a      reaching over two\u000a      million viewers. It informed the general public and stimulated an on-line\u000a      debate.\u000a    While this activity was prompted by a major news story, Prof.\u000a      Al-Khalili's on-going and wide-ranging\u000a      science communication and public engagement activities have had an even\u000a      greater and\u000a      more lasting impact. He has just written his fifth popular science book (Paradox:\u000a        The Nine Greatest\u000a        Enigmas in Physics [S2]) and is currently writing his sixth, on\u000a      quantum biology. His highly\u000a      successful book, Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed (first\u000a      published in paperback in 2004), which\u000a      was instrumental in his winning the Royal Society Michael Faraday Medal in\u000a      2007, as its youngest\u000a      ever recipient [S3], is linked to his body of research in nuclear reaction\u000a      theory and related quantum\u000a      mechanics. In collaboration with other nuclear physicists, he wrote Nucleus:\u000a        A Trip into the Heart of\u000a        Matter (revised and updated in 2012), which is the only `coffee\u000a      table' book on nuclear physics ever\u000a      published. The link between this book and Al-Khalili's research is seen\u000a      explicitly in a section of\u000a      Chapter 4, which describes his research on the structure of exotic halo\u000a      nuclei [ref. 3]. In total, Al-Khalili's\u000a      books have sold over 100,000 copies and have been translated into 20\u000a      languages [C2].\u000a      Reviewers of his books note their societal impact in informing, inspiring\u000a      and stimulating the public.\u000a    Al-Khalili's television career began in the late 90s, but his big break\u000a      came in 2007 when he\u000a      presented the BBC Four series Atom. [S4] (First broadcast on BBC\u000a      Four in 2007, it has since been\u000a      repeated on both BBC Four and Two within the REF period, as well as in\u000a      many countries around\u000a      the world.) Many observers at the BBC, including the then Director\u000a      General, Mark Thompson, have\u000a      commented that the series marked a watershed in the way science\u000a      documentaries are now made.\u000a      The second hour of the series was devoted entirely to nuclear physics and\u000a      drew on Al-Khalili's\u000a      research on halo nuclei while at the Niels Bohr Institute. Reviewers on\u000a      public websites have\u000a      described how the programme amazed them (e.g. `blew my socks off')\u000a      and inspired physics study.\u000a    Since then, Al-Khalili has gone on to make nine more science\u000a      documentaries. As evidence of\u000a      the impact of his work in science communication, his programmes have had\u000a      three Grierson Trust\u000a      nominations and one BAFTA nomination, and have won the Athens\u000a      International Science Film\u000a      Festival prize and an Association of British Science Writers prize for\u000a      best science documentary.\u000a      The total number of viewers for Al-Khalili's most recent four BBC\u000a      programmes is estimated to be\u000a      over 10 million. Audience surveys (internal to the BBC) reveal that his\u000a      programmes consistently\u000a      achieve an Audience Appreciation Index of 88&#177;1%, which is considerably\u000a      higher than the average.\u000a    Al-Khalili now has a weekly programme on Radio 4: The Life Scientific,\u000a      which runs for 24 weeks\u000a      of the year [S5]. The programme has an average weekly audience of 2.2\u000a      million. Feedback\u000a      obtained from an internal BBC `Pulse Survey' from March 2012 indicates its\u000a      format has been\u000a      extremely successful [S6]. Radio 4 controller, Gwyneth Williams, has\u000a      stated that Al-Khalili is an\u000a      excellent communicator \"but fundamental to his role in such a high profile\u000a      programme is his\u000a      research expertise and his locus as a working physicist.\" [S7]\u000a    The new Editor of BBC Four, Cassian Harrison, has explained how\u000a      Al-Khalili's experience as a\u000a      researcher is necessary for his programmes to have a maximum impact on\u000a      audiences: \"Professor\u000a      Al-Khalili has shown a consistent ability to encapsulate and to\u000a      communicate some of the most\u000a      complex principles and theories in contemporary physics with a clarity and\u000a      insight that is clearly\u000a      born not only from years of study but also from his ongoing work and\u000a        research.\" [S8] The previous\u000a      controller for BBC Four, Richard Klein, has emphasised the importance of\u000a      Al-Khalili being an active\u000a      scientific researcher when presenting programmes: \"I have no doubt that\u000a      Jim Al-Khalili's research &#8212; his\u000a      willingness to re-consider and re-think the big ideas in physics &#8212; has\u000a      been a huge contribution\u000a      to his standing as one of BBC Four's principal science presenters.\"\u000a    Al-Khalili's media work has been credited with contributing to the sharp\u000a      increase in the number\u000a      of students applying to study physics at University.[S9] Peter Main,\u000a      Director of Education and\u000a      Science at the Institute of Physics, has said: \"There is no doubt that his\u000a      thoughtful and intelligent\u000a      contributions to public engagement have had a major impact, not least in\u000a      improving the public's\u000a      perception and understanding of science, and physics in particular, but\u000a      also in encouraging more\u000a      young people to study the subject at school and at university. A\u000a      particular feature of Jim's media\u000a      work is the way that he draws upon his own research experience as a\u000a      nuclear physicist.\"\u000a    Al-Khalili has also achieved impact on science policy and culture. In\u000a      2012, he was invited by a\u000a      House of Lords All Party Parliamentary Group to deliver a keynote speech\u000a      on thorium-fuelled\u000a      nuclear reactors. He has represented the world of science as a judge on\u000a      several cultural awards\u000a      panels (such as the Art Fund Prize) and has helped to develop science and\u000a      science education\u000a      policy through his contributions to learned societies and organisations,\u000a      including the Royal Society.\u000a    Al-Khalili actively promotes his research through regular blogs on his\u000a      website and Twitter (with\u000a      ca. 50k followers) [see http:\/\/jimalkhalili.com\/\u000a      Twitter: @jimalkhalili ]. His blog-post on the OPERA\u000a      `faster than light' neutrinos experiment was read by more than 13,000\u000a      people in a single weekend\u000a      in 2011. He stimulates public debate with his regular comments in the\u000a      media about scientific issues\u000a      [S10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research carried out by Surrey's Nuclear Physics Group and the\u000a      expertise of its members\u000a      have informed and stimulated debate on a wide range of scientific areas\u000a      via broadcasting, the\u000a      press, science policy, STEM education, and wider public engagement.\u000a    Professor Al-Khalili, in particular, has built on his expertise and\u000a      experience in theoretical nuclear\u000a      physics, such as his published research on the properties of exotic halo\u000a      nuclei, to promote and\u000a      disseminate many fundamental ideas in quantum mechanics, and physics in\u000a      general, to the wider\u000a      public.

Their\u000a      research focusses on the\u000a      study of exotic nuclei produced at radioactive ion beam facilities around\u000a      the world.\u000a    On the experimental side, high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy is used\u000a      to measure\u000a      radiation emitted from radioactive atomic nuclei. The nuclear physicists\u000a      at the University of Surrey,\u000a      particularly Prof. Regan, have led a series of experiments at the GSI\u000a      facility in Darmstadt,\u000a      Germany, which utilises such measurements to identify and to characterise\u000a      individual nuclear\u000a      species. In this fundamental research, they identify the presence of\u000a      unique gamma-ray fingerprints,\u000a      which are particular to a given isotope. The team characterises the\u000a      internal structure of nuclei with\u000a      unusual numbers of protons and\/or neutrons, compared to the 286\u000a      radioactively-stable nuclear\u000a      species that exist in nature [1,2]. On the theory side, Prof. Al-Khalili's\u000a      main research interests are in\u000a      nuclear reaction theory and in modelling the scattering and reactions of\u000a      light exotic nuclei,\u000a      particularly those short-lived very neutron-rich nuclei with neutron\u000a      halos. These strange entities\u000a      owe their existence to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Al-Khalili and\u000a      Tostevin were the first\u000a      researchers to implement successfully a `four-body' scattering model that\u000a      took fully into account\u000a      the few-body correlations (the Borromean characteristics) in halo nuclei,\u000a      without which its\u000a      properties, such as binding energy, size and lifetime, could not be\u000a      predicted with any degree of\u000a      accuracy [3].\u000a    Together with Prof. Johnson and a PhD student (Cunningham), Al-Khalili\u000a      has recently\u000a      completed the first full calculation to describe proton-nucleus scattering\u000a      when the nuclear target\u000a      has non-zero spin. Including the spin of both projectile and target in the\u000a      reaction model leads to\u000a      new tensor terms in the potential and predicts novel observables to probe\u000a      nuclear structure [4].\u000a      This research is of interest to many reaction studies at experimental\u000a      facilities around the world.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40532","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Surrey research on the concepts of strained-layer devices has made a\u000d\u000a      major economic impact. This impact was first achieved via close\u000d\u000a      interaction with the electronics firm, Philips N.V. They were prepared to\u000d\u000a      take the risk with what was considered at the time to be an unusual\u000d\u000a      approach, and in 2000 they licensed the Surrey patent (ref. 2) on using\u000d\u000a      strain to create non-absorbing mirrors. The technology proved to be\u000d\u000a      superior to other approaches existing at the time for telecommunications\u000d\u000a      applications. Philips (and later JDS) subsequently used the non-absorbing\u000d\u000a      mirror concept in the development of high power pump lasers, which are\u000d\u000a      used for optical amplification in telecommunications systems and to pump\u000d\u000a      high-power fibre lasers, such as those used in manufacturing.\u000d\u000a    The disruptive nature of the strained-layer technology forced all of the\u000d\u000a      other semiconductor laser manufacturers to adopt it. Dr. Andrew Carter,\u000d\u000a      the Chief Technology Officer at Oclaro, one of the world's largest\u000d\u000a      telecommunications companies, has stated that the Surrey research has\u000d\u000a      \"revolutionised aspects of the design\" of optoelectronic devices [Source\u000d\u000a      S1].\u000d\u000a    The majority of semiconductor-based photonics components now use\u000d\u000a      strained-layer quantum wells as embedded technology, which represents a\u000d\u000a      major economic impact of the research. According to Photonics21, the\u000d\u000a      European task force for photonics, the global market for these components\u000d\u000a      was around &#8364;15bn in 2009 and is expected to grow to &gt;&#8364;30bn by 2015\u000d\u000a      [S2]. Furthermore, the component market levers much larger industries, e.g.\u000d\u000a      telecoms services worth more than &#8364;2 trillion at current estimates [S2].\u000d\u000a      As evidence of the reach of the economic impact of the research, it is\u000d\u000a      notable that almost all of the current known semiconductor laser\u000d\u000a      technology incorporates the strained-layer concept developed at Surrey.\u000d\u000a      Peter Selway, formerly the Director of Operations at Nortel, has\u000d\u000a      explained: \"The use of appropriately strained layers gives benefits in\u000d\u000a      almost all aspects of the performance of semiconductor lasers, so much so\u000d\u000a      that laser engineers routinely use strain to fine-tune the performance of\u000d\u000a      virtually all lasers for all applications.\" [S3]\u000d\u000a    The strained-layer quantum well concept is now being employed in InGaN\u000d\u000a      based solid-state lighting, which is starting to become the core for all\u000d\u000a      future lighting technology. In this application, the ability to\u000d\u000a      incorporate strain provides a method of optimising the emission wavelength\u000d\u000a      of the InGaN LEDs used in solid-state lighting luminaires. The current\u000d\u000a      market for lighting is worth &#8364;50bn and is expected to grow to &#8364;100bn by\u000d\u000a      2020. Strained-layer quantum well LEDs are expected to form a core aspect\u000d\u000a      of this technology [S2]. The recently commercialised Philips LED lamp,\u000d\u000a      which was the recipient of the U.S.A. Department of Energy's first-ever \"L\u000d\u000a      Prize\" [S4], utilises strained quantum wells.\u000d\u000a    The new material reported in ref. 3 (Section 3) is now being implemented\u000d\u000a      in distributed feedback (DFB) and tunable lasers for telecommunications by\u000d\u000a      UK-based CIP and global telecoms giant, Oclaro, and is directly derived\u000d\u000a      from Surrey's research in the TSB-sponsored ETOE and ETOE2 projects.\u000d\u000a    Prof. Sugawara (Fujitsu, Japan) made use of the results of Surrey\u000d\u000a      research (ref. 4 in Section 3) when he set-up QD Laser Inc. to\u000d\u000a      commercialise the technology of quantum dot lasers. Their 1.3 &#181;m quantum\u000d\u000a      dot lasers, which are currently commercialised, rely on p-doping to\u000d\u000a      provide temperature insensitivity. The mechanism by which this\u000d\u000a      insensitivity occurs and can be utilised was described in the Surrey\u000d\u000a      research.\u000d\u000a    The Photonics Group's research in developing new semiconductor materials\u000d\u000a      and devices for renewable energy has made an impact on society by\u000d\u000a      capturing the public's attention and stimulating discussion. The research\u000d\u000a      has received wide exposure in international publications for general\u000d\u000a      audiences, such as The Economist [S5] (receiving &gt;760 Facebook\u000d\u000a      likes, &gt;100 re-tweets on Twitter, and &gt;30 direct comments from the\u000d\u000a      public) and National Geographic [S6] (receiving &gt;350 Facebook\u000d\u000a      likes, &gt;130 re-tweets on Twitter, &gt;100 Google+ recommendations and\u000d\u000a      10 direct comments from the public). The research was also highlighted in\u000d\u000a      national newspaper articles in The Independent, The Observer [S7]\u000d\u000a      (&gt;70 direct comments from the public), The Sunday Times [S8],\u000d\u000a      the Times of India [S9], and more than ten trade journals in the\u000d\u000a      solar cell community. A television feature was produced by RAI (Italy) for\u000d\u000a      their Superquark popular science programme [S10], and a radio programme\u000d\u000a      was broadcast by ORF Radio (Austria). The potential of Surrey's recent\u000d\u000a      research on bismide materials to reduce the energy demands of the internet\u000d\u000a      was featured in the Financial Times [S11].\u000d\u000a    The Sunday Times article led to a direct request by the UK's\u000d\u000a      Energy Minister (Charles Hendry, MP) to visit the University to learn more\u000d\u000a      about the emerging field of research on using solar energy from space. Mr\u000d\u000a      Hendry commented: \"The work that Prof. Sweeney of the ATI and his\u000d\u000a      colleagues are doing makes us realise that the way we'll be generating\u000d\u000a      electricity in 20 years' time is radically different to the way in which\u000d\u000a      it's being done today\" [S12].

Prof. Adams and Prof. Eoin O'Reilly (who left the\u000d\u000a      University in 2000) showed that by deliberately incorporating a thin\u000d\u000a      semiconductor layer (i.e. a quantum well) with different lattice\u000d\u000a      constant to the host crystal substrate, the resulting strain would bring a\u000d\u000a      number of enhanced optical properties. These properties make lasers,\u000d\u000a      optical amplifiers and other optoelectronic components more efficient and\u000d\u000a      faster in operation. Strained-layer devices were demonstrated commercially\u000d\u000a      by Philips, working with Surrey researchers, and extended to applications\u000d\u000a      in high power laser diodes for manufacturing and printing. Adams extended\u000d\u000a      the idea of using strain from lattice mismatch to create non-absorbing\u000d\u000a      mirrors in high power lasers, as was described in a patent [2].\u000d\u000a    More recently, under the direction of Prof. Stephen Sweeney, the\u000d\u000a      Photonics Group has made large inroads into developing alternative III-V\u000d\u000a      material approaches for high efficiency lasers. They demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      1550 nm InGaAlAs quantum well buried heterostructure lasers offer superior\u000d\u000a      high temperature performance [3]. Other research, in collaboration with Dr\u000d\u000a      Andreev (senior lecturer in the Photonics Group), described how p-doping\u000d\u000a      in InAs\/GaAs quantum dots imparts improved temperature stability in\u000d\u000a      semiconductor lasers [4].\u000d\u000a    Research on quantum well lasers, published by the Group in 1999, showed\u000d\u000a      that even in the best strained-layer quantum well lasers, the efficiency\u000d\u000a      is governed by non-radiative Auger processes involving the spin-orbit band\u000d\u000a      [5]. This finding led to work on new materials where the spin-orbit\u000d\u000a      splitting energy could be increased to remove the Auger processes.\u000d\u000a      Recently, another patent has been published by the Group [6] on an\u000d\u000a      entirely new class of III-V semiconductor (based on bismuth alloys), which\u000d\u000a      provides an optimised band structure offering power savings of 80% due to\u000d\u000a      loss suppression. The inclusion of bismuth in a III-V material increases\u000d\u000a      the spin-orbit splitting energy whilst reducing the band gap. When the\u000d\u000a      spin-orbit splitting energy exceeds the band gap energy, the major Auger\u000d\u000a      processes are inhibited, thus reducing the sensitivity of lasers to\u000d\u000a      changes in ambient temperature. Initial experimental evidence that this\u000d\u000a      concept can be achieved in practice was recently reported [7].\u000d\u000a    In parallel, the Photonics Group has been working closely with\u000d\u000a      EADS-Astrium to develop new semiconductor materials for photovoltaics to\u000d\u000a      capture solar energy in space. Highly efficient (&gt;43%) photovoltaic\u000d\u000a      cells have been designed and tested at Surrey and are part of a pilot\u000d\u000a      programme to develop space-based solar power. This collaborative research\u000d\u000a      has formed the basis of a European Space Agency pilot study involving\u000d\u000a      Surrey to develop a fully working prototype.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40533","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The primary impact of Surrey's research is economic through the creation\u000d\u000a      of a viable spin-out company, new jobs, and new commercial products.\u000d\u000a      Impact from the research started in 2001, and it continued throughout the\u000d\u000a      REF period.\u000d\u000a    Soon after the terrorist attacks in the USA on September 11, 2001, Morton\u000d\u000a      met with leading experts in security inspection. This meeting inspired the\u000d\u000a      creation of a spin-out company, called CXR Ltd, in the summer of 2002.\u000d\u000a      Morton was the founding director and CEO, and three members of the\u000d\u000a      university research team (Luggar, DeAntonis, Menezes) were employed there.\u000d\u000a      This job creation marked the first example of economic impact. The work\u000d\u000a      conducted at the University and subsequently at CXR Ltd. led to the filing\u000d\u000a      of over 20 patent families on all aspects of the design and application of\u000d\u000a      RTT systems [Corroboration C1]. In 2004, after three rounds of investment,\u000d\u000a      OSI Systems Inc, a global privately-held company, embedded CXR's\u000d\u000a      technology in its security division company, called Rapiscan Systems,\u000d\u000a      which is based in the UK.\u000d\u000a    According to an OSI Systems report in 2005, the company had the vision\u000d\u000a      that RTT \"if successfully completed, could provide significant\u000d\u000a      improvements over current hold baggage screening technologies.\" [C2]\u000d\u000a      Today, the primary application of RTT technology is in the security\u000d\u000a      inspection business, specifically for high-throughput automated screening\u000d\u000a      of hold baggage for improvised explosive devices.\u000d\u000a    Since the formation of the spin-out company, many $M have been invested\u000d\u000a      in the technology. In early 2009 two types of high-speed baggage systems,\u000d\u000a      with tunnel diameters of 80 cm and 110 cm, were trialled at Manchester\u000d\u000a      Airport in a $7M contract (making additional economic impact).[C3] The key\u000d\u000a      objectives of the trials were to establish reliability of the system with\u000d\u000a      real passenger bags, to collect data for certification, and to benchmark\u000d\u000a      the system integration efficiency. Certification was obtained for the 80\u000d\u000a      and 110 cm systems in 2012 and 2013, respectively, approving them for use\u000d\u000a      as standard three-hold baggage screening systems with automated explosives\u000d\u000a      detection. Following the trials, the first two fully-operational systems\u000d\u000a      will be installed at Manchester Airport as part of a contract worth in\u000d\u000a      excess of $20 million.\u000d\u000a    Scanning airport baggage for explosives and other suspicious items is\u000d\u000a      usually a time-consuming task. First, bags go through an automated X-ray\u000d\u000a      system and, if this shows something suspicious, the bag is put into an\u000d\u000a      automated hospital-style X-ray computerised tomography (CT) scanner, which\u000d\u000a      is used to build up a cross-sectional image. However, CT scanning is slow,\u000d\u000a      and the initial X-ray scan often throws up false positives. Surrey's\u000d\u000a      research developed a system that can produce CT images in the same time as\u000d\u000a      a single automated X-ray system. RTT cuts out one step of the scanning\u000d\u000a      process, it reduces the cost of scanning, and it also reduces false\u000d\u000a      positives [ref. C4, C5]. When applied to hold baggage, RTT scanners can\u000d\u000a      scan 1200 to 1800 bags per hour, which is four times faster than current\u000d\u000a      technologies, which is beneficial to the aviation industry and to airport\u000d\u000a      passengers. Rapiscan's RTT 80 System offers significant cost savings in\u000d\u000a      comparison to standard CT scanning [C6]: up to 50% on maintenance; 33% on\u000d\u000a      infrastructure (installation and integration); 23% lower hardware costs\u000d\u000a      (fewer machines required because of faster scanning); and 30% on lifetime\u000d\u000a      recurring costs.\u000d\u000a    The technology arising from Surrey's research has led to job creation and\u000d\u000a      new industrial products. More than 50 engineers are employed on Rapiscan's\u000d\u000a      RTT programme at a new UK factory in Salfords, Surrey that was\u000d\u000a      specifically built for the manufacture of the key technology in the RTT\u000d\u000a      system: the multi-emitter X-ray tube. Thus, the technology and principles\u000d\u000a      behind RTT are together creating economic impact through a major\u000d\u000a      export-led business, based in the UK, with US financial backing.[C7]\u000d\u000a    There is other continuing economic impact in job creation and exports. A\u000d\u000a      broad technology platform for high energy X-ray inspection of cargo\u000d\u000a      systems, developed by Morton, is manufactured in the UK from a\u000d\u000a      purpose-built factory (65,000 sq. ft.) near Stoke-on-Trent. This factory\u000d\u000a      currently employs over 60 staff in both engineering and operations. From\u000d\u000a      here, $M high energy inspection systems are exported to all parts of the\u000d\u000a      world. Parts of these systems use the core detection and electronics\u000d\u000a      technologies that were initially developed with University expertise at\u000d\u000a      CXR.\u000d\u000a    EPSRC has recognised the Surrey research as having a high impact.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, they highlighted the Surrey research in their 2011 Annual\u000d\u000a      Report as an example of \"high quality and high impact projects funded\u000d\u000a      through investigator-initiated research base funding.\" [C8] The\u000d\u000a      significance of the RTT technology behind the Rapiscan Systems products\u000d\u000a      was recognised by an award from The Engineer magazine in the\u000d\u000a      category of Defence and Security and by the Best Innovator Award (2011\/12)\u000d\u000a      from the Airport Operators Association. [C9]\u000d\u000a    Rapiscan Systems and CXR Ltd. have made significant efforts to engage\u000d\u000a      with the wider research community. Active research programmes are in place\u000d\u000a      with the University of Surrey as well as with STFC staff at Harwell and\u000d\u000a      Daresbury. There is on-going research on RTT reconstruction algorithms.\u000d\u000a      The methods so developed are now being written in real-time\u000d\u000a      implementations for use in the main RTT systems.\u000d\u000a    EU European Civil Aviation Conference \"Standard 3\" requirements for\u000d\u000a      explosive detection systems stipulate that after 2014 all new baggage\u000d\u000a      systems must use CT scanners and by 2018 all old, non-CT systems must be\u000d\u000a      replaced. With the RTT scanner that emerged from Surrey research, Rapiscan\u000d\u000a      Systems is therefore well placed to become the major supplier of CT\u000d\u000a      scanners to airports in Europe and the rest of the world.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Radiation physicists at the University of Surrey developed a unique X-ray\u000d\u000a      imaging technology for high-speed real-time tomography (RTT) during 1997\u000d\u000a      to 2005. The originating research developed new X-ray methods for\u000d\u000a      tomographic imaging of multiphase flow in pipes. RTT was then applied to\u000d\u000a      security X-ray imaging, specifically the high-speed screening of aircraft\u000d\u000a      passenger baggage. As a direct result of the research, a spin-out company\u000d\u000a      from the University, CXR Ltd, was formed, and it was later acquired by\u000d\u000a      Rapiscan Systems.\u000d\u000a    Surrey's imaging technology is now approved for use for automated\u000d\u000a      explosives detection in the European aviation sector.

The research idea originated from\u000d\u000a      an initial discussion with BP Exploration about multiphase flow metering\u000d\u000a      of well heads. Dr Ed Morton proposed the idea of real-time tomography for\u000d\u000a      this application. BP were interested in such a development and provided\u000d\u000a      seed funding to start a research programme.\u000d\u000a    The research team investigated a wide range of components including\u000d\u000a      electron guns, X-ray anodes, vacuum systems, high voltage insulators,\u000d\u000a      X-ray detectors and data acquisition systems. The components were\u000d\u000a      developed to the proof-of-concept stage. Specifically, they demonstrated\u000d\u000a      an end-to-end imaging system, going from an electron gun to the image on a\u000d\u000a      screen, using components that were all designed from first principles for\u000d\u000a      this task (ref. 1). These component developments include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Design and modelling of a multi-emitter grid-controlled electron gun\u000d\u000a        and associated electronic drive circuits. Key issues to solve were\u000d\u000a        inter-emitter uniformity and low grid switching voltage. Morton's team\u000d\u000a        adopted a space charge-limited design approach using tungsten filaments\u000d\u000a        with closely spaced grid elements to minimise switching voltages. This\u000d\u000a        work has evolved over the intervening period to high-performance,\u000d\u000a        high-reliability, low-cost designs with excellent uniformity and low\u000d\u000a        switching voltages.\u000d\u000a      Design and integration of a high speed multi-channel X-ray detector\u000d\u000a        and data acquisition system. This was based on scintillation detectors\u000d\u000a        with photodiode readout. A range of other detector technologies were\u000d\u000a        investigated, with some significant work being completed on gas\u000d\u000a        microstructure detectors and room temperature semiconductor detectors.\u000d\u000a        Several publications on room temperature semiconductors and gas\u000d\u000a        microstructure detectors resulted from this related work.\u000d\u000a      Design and modelling of X-ray targets (ref. 2).

His knowledge of space science, technology,\u000a      instrumentation and mission implementation backed by departmental input\u000a      enabled him to play a leading role in the areas of the science and\u000a      academic related recommendations i.e. the need for a National Space\u000a      Technology Strategy, Skills Base, Science and ESA missions as well as\u000a      others. The IGS led to the National Space Technology Plan (NSTP) [b]\u000a      where as the only academic on the report's editorial board he again\u000a      supplied key input, and emphasised the underpinning role of academia. This\u000a      led to the formation of the National Space Technology Steering Group\u000a      (NSTSG) where Sims is one of only four academic members in an industry\u000a      dominated group totalling 27. The NSTSG advises the Government's Space\u000a      Leadership Council on Space independently of the UK Space Agency.\u000a    Similarly Prof. John Remedios has provided the science lead and academic\u000a      input as a member of the Steering Committee for the IGS restack\/update\u000a      process just completed, which has further developed the original\u000a      recommendations and will be a key input into future policy. He has\u000a      championed the role of bilateral and science missions to build links for\u000a      export markets.\u000a    The impact of the IGS and NSTP and their transformation of space policy\u000a      are fully acknowledged by the UK Space Agency [c]. In March 2011\u000a      the UK Government announced an initial &#163;10M contribution to the NSTP which\u000a      resulted in a delivery programme [d] which states that the NSTP is\u000a      based directly upon the work and recommendations of the IGS Capabilities\u000a      group (co-chaired by Sims).\u000a    In 2012 as a result of the change in policy the UK made a ~25% increase\u000a      (~&#163;50M\/yr) in its ESA subscription [e] securing an estimated\u000a      &#163;1Billion in UK industrial contracts which along with the NSTP will lead\u000a      to substantial additional opportunities for UK industry and academia. In\u000a      order to further promote growth the Technology Strategy Board has funded a\u000a      Satellite Applications Catapult Centre, a successor to International Space\u000a      Innovations Centre where the Unit was a founding academic member and Prof.\u000a      Martin Barstow was a board member.\u000a    Regarding direct work on influencing industry, one example here is the\u000a      development (started in 2007) of feature detection algorithms for\u000a      autonomous detection of geological features on Mars. This catalysed in\u000a      conjunction with industrial research on autonomy a series of EU and ESA\u000a      funded studies which have involved UK industry including Scisys Ltd. a UK\u000a      space software company. These include the ProViScout EU study [f]\u000a      and the related follow-on ESA SAFER study [g] where Leicester\u000a      supplies the project geologist and consultant regarding the algorithms, a\u000a      study critical post. ProViScout was the first of a number of space\u000a      autonomous vehicle projects undertaken by Scisys which has led to further\u000a      studies (e.g. SAFER), income and development research for the company\u000a      including a recent study for use of such vehicles in nuclear waste\u000a      repositories.\u000a    Research impact has also occurred locally. The SRC has worked with an SME\u000a      Magna Parva Ltd (MP) company to develop technology for the LMC instrument,\u000a      originally intended for ExoMars and for the Bepi-Colombo MIXS instrument.\u000a      MP provided management and technical support to the LMC under a contract\u000a      with a total value of &#163;0.9M (2008 to 2013). Immediate impact to the\u000a      company along with ESA contract work for MIXS was an income stream and\u000a      increased employment, which helped aid growth of the company and gained it\u000a      direct experience in working with ESA on large projects. In 2010 in an\u000a      UL\/MP internal case study [h] the collaboration was estimated to be\u000a      worth an increased turnover of &#163;650k and 7 new members of staff for the\u000a      company (doubling company size). LMC also led to spin-off developments\u000a      such as the ExoLab a stand-alone sample processing system, and recently a\u000a      new MP-funded spinoff company MPDx Technologies [i] which aims to\u000a      exploit such technologies in other important fields including medicine.\u000a    There are many other examples of the Unit producing industrial impact\u000a      provided additional income to larger companies including consultancies for\u000a      ESA studies on missions and technologies with for example EADS-Astrium and\u000a      Systems Engineering Assessment Ltd. For example, the Unit had a preferred\u000a      partnership with EADS-Astrium 2007-2012 [j] (currently being\u000a      renegotiated).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Space has been identified as an area of economic growth by the UK\u000a      Government as a direct result of the 2010 Innovation and Growth Strategy\u000a      (IGS) for Space. This study has resulted in a transformational change with\u000a      the formation of the UK Space Agency, significantly increased investment\u000a      and new opportunities.

The Unit, as a world leading institution in Space\u000a      research, has played critical roles as principal or co-investigators i.e.\u000a      instrument, mission and technology developers, and science leads in a\u000a      number of key \"cutting edge\" missions and instruments throughout this\u000a      period [1]. Examples include Ariel V in 1974 which transformed\u000a      X-ray astronomy through to XMM [2] which has been the main stay of\u000a      X-ray astronomy since its launch in 1999 with the Unit providing the\u000a      XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre.

Full impact is therefore approached asymptotically over\u000a      many years. Here we\u000a      report the impact has been achieved for multiple detector technologies and\u000a      that the results of a\u000a      coordinated programme of detector development over nearly two decades,\u000a      based on a Bioimaging\u000a      Unit with its own dedicated laboratory space, include the following\u000a      significant achievements:\u000a    (i) Initial patient trials of a portable gamma camera (in clinic,\u000a          Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham)\u000a    Confirmation of diagnosis in breast cancer, melanoma and in certain other\u000a      cancers is achieved\u000a      using \"sentinel node biopsy\". This requires the surgeon to locate and\u000a      remove relevant lymph nodes\u000a      so that they can be tested to see if the cancer has spread. The position\u000a      of the lymph nodes is\u000a      usually detected by injecting a short-half-life radioactive substance into\u000a      the tumour, which then\u000a      drains away via the lymphatic system. The location of the first (sentinel)\u000a      node is usually detected\u000a      with a non-imaging gamma probe, with low precision. The new camera\u000a      provides the surgeon with a\u000a      visible light image overlaid with the pattern of uptake of a radioactive\u000a      tracer such as 99mTc (a\u000a      short-lived emitter of 140 keV gamma rays). The gamma channel of the\u000a      camera provides both sub-mm\u000a      spatial resolution and sufficient energy resolution to discriminate\u000a      against scattered photons,\u000a      which would otherwise blur the image structure. Early collaborative work\u000a      in this area with Prof.\u000a      Robert Ott (Institute of Cancer Research) led to a patent originally filed\u000a      in Dec 2000 (Devices for\u000a      imaging radionuclide emissions, Lees, Fraser and Ott).

Once the\u000a      technical feasibility of the\u000a      approach was established, an Innovation Fellowship from the East Midlands\u000a      Development Agency\u000a      funded the design and production of an instrument that was installed on a\u000a      standard slit lamp at LRI,\u000a      to allow precise, selective measurements of the reflectance spectrum of\u000a      the sclera of the eye. With\u000a      medical ethics committee approval, patients presenting conditions\u000a      affecting the sclera were\u000a      assessed using the device. The results showed a consistently reproducible,\u000a      characteristic\u000a      signature for the eye condition scleritis [6]. The technique is now\u000a      being extended, using STFC\u000a      innovation funding, to corneal ulcers.

At King's he\u000d\u000a      has held positions as Royal Society University Research Fellow\u000d\u000a      (2000-2003), Reader in Physics (2003-2007) and Professor of Physics\u000d\u000a      (2007-). In particular, his research work has concerned the development of\u000d\u000a      techniques requiring the sensitive spectroscopy detection of fluorescence\u000d\u000a      and Raman scattering; this research has enabled him to develop a strong\u000d\u000a      knowledge of all aspects of fluorescence measurements, especially in\u000d\u000a      biomedical applications.\u000d\u000a    Until 2003 Richards' research was concerned with the development and\u000d\u000a      application of the technique of scanning near-field optical microscopy\u000d\u000a      (SNOM) to thin film fluorescent nanostructures for the nanoscale analysis\u000d\u000a      of their morphology [1,2]. From 2001-2008 he developed tip-enhanced Raman\u000d\u000a      scattering and subsequently tip-enhanced fluorescence microscopy, with the\u000d\u000a      demonstration of 60 nm resolution fluorescence imaging of single quantum\u000d\u000a      dots and quantum dot clusters [3,5]. These programmes involved the\u000d\u000a      development of new instrumentation, requiring in particular the detection\u000d\u000a      of low fluorescence light levels and using optical fibre light delivery\u000d\u000a      for remote access. From 2005 he developed a programme of research\u000d\u000a      concerned with enhancement and lifetime modification of fluorescence in\u000d\u000a      the vicinity of metal nanostructures [4,5], with particular application in\u000d\u000a      biomedicine. This formed part of a wider EPSRC-funded programme developed\u000d\u000a      and led by Professors Malcolm Irving FRS (PI and Director of the Randall\u000d\u000a      Division for Cell &amp; Molecular Biophysics), Tony Ng (Richard Dimbleby\u000d\u000a      Chair of Cancer Research) and David Richards, concerned with the\u000d\u000a      development of a new optical proteomic technology, employing fluorescence\u000d\u000a      techniques for the identification of protein interactions in situ\u000d\u000a      in biological cells. This involved an interdisciplinary network of\u000d\u000a      researchers across King's College London, including the Department of\u000d\u000a      Physics, the Randall Division, the Department of Maths, the Division of\u000d\u000a      Cancer Studies. The research strand led directly by David Richards,\u000d\u000a      concerned with the development of plasmonic nanostructure substrates, led\u000d\u000a      to the development of a novel fluorescence assay for protein\u000d\u000a      internalisation, the final report on which was published in 2010 [6].\u000d\u000a    In 2007, David Richards brought together, through the establishment of\u000d\u000a      the KCL Centre for Biophotonics, the strong cross-College activity in\u000d\u000a      fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging, with application to biomedical\u000d\u000a      sciences, which had developed within King's since 2000.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41215","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In view of the world leading recognition of his expertise in particle\u000a      physics, and his active and ongoing research in collider phenomenology and\u000a      the properties of the Higgs boson in particular, John Ellis has received\u000a      numerous requests for interviews from print and broadcast media and\u000a      invitations to deliver public lectures.

This discovery provides\u000a      experimental evidence for the origin of particle masses, which govern\u000a      diverse phenomena such as the sizes of atoms and the relative weakness of\u000a      radioactive processes.\u000a    John Ellis has long been a world leader in the search for new particle\u000a      physics and the interpretation of new experimental data. In particular, he\u000a      was a pioneer in the search for the Higgs boson and a leading formative\u000a      influence on the LHC experimental programme at CERN. As a result, he was\u000a      uniquely placed to play a leading international role in the analysis of\u000a      LHC data when they started emerging in 2011, and he and his research team\u000a      have led predictions concerning the existence and properties of the Higgs\u000a      boson, as well as the interpretation of the new particle discovered at the\u000a      LHC. Even before the discovery of the Higgs boson, he was at the forefront\u000a      of efforts to predict its mass and other properties. Once signals of a\u000a      Higgs-like particle started appearing in the LHC data, he immediately\u000a      analysed its key properties, publishing several important and original\u000a      papers determining its couplings to other particles and its spin\u000a      (intrinsic angular momentum).\u000a    Professor Ellis was appointed Clerk Maxwell Professor of Theoretical\u000a      Physics at King's College London from 1st August 2010. Since then, his\u000a      research has included an analysis of the way this new particle couples to\u000a      other particles, demonstrating the predicted connection with particle\u000a      masses, and the proposal of methods to determine the spin of this new\u000a      particle, one of which has been used to provide the first experimental\u000a      evidence that it has spin zero, as predicted. This research was carried\u000a      out between the Autumn of 2011 and the Spring of 2013, with key\u000a      publications appearing in February 2012, April 2012, July 2012, August\u000a      2012, October 2012, November 2012, February and March 2013. Some of the\u000a      high-impact research papers listed were written by John Ellis and Tevong\u000a      You (PhD student who started working at King's in September 2012, under\u000a      Professor Ellis' supervision), without external collaborators. Some of the\u000a      research was done in collaboration with theoretical physicists from York\u000a      University in Canada and Sejong University in Korea. Other related\u000a      research papers not listed were written in collaboration with experimental\u000a      physicists from Imperial College and CERN, and theoretical physicists from\u000a      the University of Minnesota in the US and elsewhere.

Young's idea was to create artistic\u000d\u000a      works which featured legal\u000d\u000a      agreements but which also explored ideas in theoretical physics such as\u000d\u000a      dark matter. She turned\u000d\u000a      to Fairbairn for scientific advice and guidance in order to make them\u000d\u000a      scientifically credible. Over\u000d\u000a      several meetings in 2010, conversations between Young and Fairbairn about\u000d\u000a      his research into\u000d\u000a      dark matter and cosmology led to the development of two artistic works\u000d\u000a      which featured Fairbairn's\u000d\u000a      calculations and advice.\u000d\u000a    In particular, \"Missing Mass\" is a sculptural work, of an open-top\u000d\u000a      perspex container, said to contain\u000d\u000a      5,461 dark matter particles, the number calculated by Fairbairn to be\u000d\u000a      present within the 18 x 18 x\u000d\u000a      18 inches volume, based upon a 10GeV WIMP dark matter particle which\u000d\u000a      Fairbairn and Schwetz\u000d\u000a      showed was predicted by the DAMA experiment. As with a number of the\u000d\u000a      artist's works, the piece\u000d\u000a      uses \"a legal disclaimer which proposes the particles as the only truly\u000d\u000a      free entities in existence,\u000d\u000a      since they can pass through any material entity on the planet\".1\u000d\u000a      This work focuses on the fact that\u000d\u000a      since the dark matter constantly flows through the Perspex, it is both\u000d\u000a      ephemeral and unobtainable,\u000d\u000a      yet it is also physical; as indicated in the disclaimer, \"any collector of\u000d\u000a      this work should not expect to\u000d\u000a      own the same 5,461 dark matter particles at any one time\".2\u000d\u000a    The second piece, \"Terminal Velocity\" informs the observer how\u000d\u000a      quickly the Earth is moving\u000d\u000a      through the Universe. It shows vinyl text of the wording `1,404,000 miles\u000d\u000a      per hour' on the gallery\u000d\u000a      wall with a spotlight, this representing the speed (calculated by\u000d\u000a      Fairbairn) of the gallery in space\u000d\u000a      relative to the Big Bang.\u000d\u000a    These works inspired by Fairbairn's research are a tangible demonstration\u000d\u000a      of the increasing\u000d\u000a      concern to examine the interrelation between art and science and explore\u000d\u000a      their mutual impacts.\u000d\u000a      They have been exhibited in a number of high profile galleries around the\u000d\u000a      world including the Paula\u000d\u000a      Cooper Gallery in New York, Marianne Boesky Gallery (New York),\u000d\u000a      Cornerhouse (Manchester)\u000d\u000a      and Le Quartier (Quimper, Brittany). Young's exhibition in Manchester\u000d\u000a      attracted around 12,000\u000d\u000a      visitors and she estimates that in total the works have been viewed by\u000d\u000a      50,000 to 100,000 visitors\u000d\u000a      so far, a number which is still rising.1\u000d\u000a    Gallery visitors have shown considerable engagement with the pieces and,\u000d\u000a      from the positive\u000d\u000a      feedback Carey Young has received, she considers that the resultant impact\u000d\u000a      has demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that \"the works made people aware of scientific and legal issues they\u000d\u000a      would not normally\u000d\u000a      consider\".1 Through the medium of her artistic work, and the\u000d\u000a      associated gallery marketing\u000d\u000a      publications and press exposure, Fairbairn has been able to reach members\u000d\u000a      of the public who\u000d\u000a      normally might have little or no exposure to some of the contemporary\u000d\u000a      ideas of astrophysics and\u000d\u000a      cosmology.\u000d\u000a    Fairbairn's commitment to public engagement is integral to his academic\u000d\u000a      endeavour. Following his\u000d\u000a      arrival at KCL, he launched a number of activities to engage school pupils\u000d\u000a      in London and\u000d\u000a      developed outreach activities specifically aimed at members of the public.\u000d\u000a      The majority have\u000d\u000a      related to the subject of dark matter, with the aim of increasing public\u000d\u000a      interest in physics research\u000d\u000a      and to make lay audiences feel less distanced from it. A key aim is to\u000d\u000a      motivate students to go on to\u000d\u000a      study Physics at university.\u000d\u000a    Since 2008 Fairbairn has given around 35 dark matter talks in various\u000d\u000a      forums. Fairbairn began by\u000d\u000a      giving talks in individual schools but this soon evolved into him\u000d\u000a      instigating physics evenings at the\u000d\u000a      KCL Strand campus in central London, where school parties of enthusiastic\u000d\u000a      students come from all\u000d\u000a      over the South East. Using contacts built up through Fairbairn's\u000d\u000a      administration of the department's\u000d\u000a      University Ambassador Scheme, between 120 and 160 students attend each of\u000d\u000a      these events,\u000d\u000a      which now run two or three times a year. At Physics taster days, when\u000d\u000a      students deciding what to\u000d\u000a      study at University visit King's College London, students often report in\u000d\u000a      feedback forms that\u000d\u000a      Fairbairn's talk on Dark Matter was the highlight of their visit.3\u000d\u000a      Fairbairn has worked to engage\u000d\u000a      members of the public giving evening courses on cosmology at the Royal\u000d\u000a      Institution, presenting six\u000d\u000a      evening lectures over the course of two months to communicate the basics\u000d\u000a      of current, cutting edge\u000d\u000a      research into cosmology, dark matter and dark energy.\u000d\u000a    Testimonies from school teachers report that Fairbairn's talks have fired\u000d\u000a      their students'\u000d\u000a      imaginations, providing them with significant inspiration and aspiration\u000d\u000a      and made many think\u000d\u000a      seriously about Physics as a degree subject, when previously they had not\u000d\u000a      considered this.4,5 As\u000d\u000a      one Head of Science has stated: \"It is always possible to judge the\u000d\u000a      success of talks like [that given\u000d\u000a      by Fairbairn] from the discussion that takes place afterwards, and the\u000d\u000a      range and sheer number of\u000d\u000a      questions was a powerful indicator of how successful the talk was ...\u000d\u000a      Those of us who work in\u000d\u000a      schools are always very grateful when people like Malcolm appear, who are\u000d\u000a      working physicists at\u000d\u000a      the cutting edge of their subject and who are not only willing to share\u000d\u000a      their enthusiasm and\u000d\u000a      expertise with young people but do so with such insight, interest and\u000d\u000a      energy.\" 4 Another has written\u000d\u000a      that the talks, \"have provided an enormous amount of inspiration and\u000d\u000a      aspiration to the students\u000d\u000a      from Ilford County High School and is one of the factors leading to a\u000d\u000a      general increase of interest in\u000d\u000a      Physics and university applications at the school.\" 5\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Malcolm Fairbairn has worked alongside visual artist Carey Young to\u000d\u000a      inspire contemporary\u000d\u000a      artwork that have exhibited internationally and been viewed by ca. 100,\u000d\u000a      000 people.

This area covers primordial inflation, dark\u000d\u000a      energy and astroparticle\u000d\u000a      physics, although he has concentrated mainly on the subject of dark matter\u000d\u000a      since joining the\u000d\u000a      Department of Physics, King's College London (Lecturer 2007-11, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer 2011-13,\u000d\u000a      Reader 2013 - present).

Research conducted at King's College London since 2007 has\u000d\u000a      informed his outreach\u000d\u000a      since 2008.\u000d\u000a    Work by Fairbairn and Schwetz [3] has focused on the analysis of\u000d\u000a      conflicting results from two\u000d\u000a      different dark matter direct detection experiments. The DAMA dark matter\u000d\u000a      detection experiment in\u000d\u000a      Gran Sasso has long claimed evidence for an annual modulation in its event\u000d\u000a      rate which is\u000d\u000a      consistent with a dark matter particle of mass 10 GeV. This is in conflict\u000d\u000a      with the larger XENON-10\u000d\u000a      and XENON-100 experiments which claim to have ruled out the same region of\u000d\u000a      parameter space.\u000d\u000a      Fairbairn's research re-analysed the DAMA data and showed the importance\u000d\u000a      of studying the\u000d\u000a      energy dependence of the direct detection rate. This research recast the\u000d\u000a      nature of the discrepancy\u000d\u000a      between the two experiments, informing possible particle physics scenarios\u000d\u000a      which could explain\u000d\u000a      both experimental results.\u000d\u000a    Another experimental anomaly presented to theorists around this time was\u000d\u000a      the discovery of many\u000d\u000a      high energy positrons by the PAMELA experiment in orbit above the Earth.\u000d\u000a      While dark matter self-annihilation\u000d\u000a      does predict the production of anti matter, the large number of positrons\u000d\u000a      observed\u000d\u000a      seems too great in comparison with the required self annihilation rate in\u000d\u000a      the early Universe which\u000d\u000a      explains the relic abundance today. A paper by Fairbairn and Zupan [2]\u000d\u000a      proposed an entirely new\u000d\u000a      particle physics theory of dark matter in order to explain this\u000d\u000a      observation, where there were two\u000d\u000a      different dark matter species, one of which decays into the other at late\u000d\u000a      times after the relic\u000d\u000a      abundance has been set. The dark matter today can therefore\u000d\u000a      self-annihilate more readily than\u000d\u000a      would be expected given its relic abundance and explain the anomalous\u000d\u000a      origin of the positrons.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41217","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The application of NQR for the improved detection and classification of\u000d\u000a      explosives, drugs and pharmaceuticals, has a worldwide impact with\u000d\u000a      applications in security, military and humanitarian sectors:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      detection of landmines in post war countries\u000d\u000a      detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in regions of\u000d\u000a        conflict\u000d\u000a      scanning of luggage and detection of explosives at borders, airports\u000d\u000a        and other check points\u000d\u000a      forensic analysis of explosives to determine the origin of explosives\u000d\u000a        used for mines and IEDs\u000d\u000a      authentication of medicine\u000d\u000a      detection and identification of illicit drugs, such as narcotics.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Much of the NQR technology development within KCL was performed within\u000d\u000a      programmes for military\/security and drug authentication applications\u000d\u000a      where the requirement was for explosives, narcotics or pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      detectors to be small enough and rugged enough for deployment on the\u000d\u000a      battlefield, at border check points or pharmacies, simple enough in\u000d\u000a      operation for use by untrained users, easily maintainable in a range of\u000d\u000a      environments, resistant to radio frequency interference and robust enough\u000d\u000a      to deal with a range of threats under a range of ambient conditions.\u000d\u000a    Research and consultancy projects funded by Her Majesty's Revenue and\u000d\u000a      Customs (HMRC), the Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), the\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Defence (MoD), the Home Office Scientific Development Branch\u000d\u000a      (HOSDB), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and, the China\u000d\u000a      Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) demonstrate the direct applicability of\u000d\u000a      KCL's intelligent sensing and detection methods in a homeland security,\u000d\u000a      military and humanitarian context; the outcomes impact on the important\u000d\u000a      topics of security and the public's health in the UK and internationally.\u000d\u000a      The work has been published widely; patents protecting intelligent\u000d\u000a      explosive detection techniques and fake drug detection methods were filed\u000d\u000a      and granted.1\u000d\u000a    In the field of medicine authentification, the KCL NQR Group has worked\u000d\u000a      closely with the Italian NMR instrument manufacturer Stelar S.r.l. to\u000d\u000a      develop a prototype for a commercial product, opening up a potential new\u000d\u000a      market for the company.

Radio-frequency\u000d\u000a      radiation excites transitions between the energy levels induced by this\u000d\u000a      interaction at frequencies that are characteristic of a given material and\u000d\u000a      can be used, therefore, not only to identify it but also to estimate\u000d\u000a      quantity. Unlike the closely related technique of nuclear magnetic\u000d\u000a      resonance (NMR), no static magnetic field is necessary, so remote\u000d\u000a      materials and large volumes can be examined. Whereas the nuclear\u000d\u000a      quadrupole moment is an intrinsic property of the element, the\u000d\u000a      electrostatic field distribution is governed by the nature of the chemical\u000d\u000a      bonds of the quadrupolar nucleus within the molecule's structure. As a\u000d\u000a      consequence, the NQR spectrum is specific to each molecule and thus\u000d\u000a      provides a unique fingerprint. NQR can be used to analyse a broad range of\u000d\u000a      solid materials and, in particular, it is ideally suited for the analysis\u000d\u000a      of 14N, a spin-1 nucleus, which is the most commonly\u000d\u000a      distributed quadrupolar nucleus found in explosives and in\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals. Other quadrupolar nuclei that are commonly found in\u000d\u000a      medicines include 23Na, 35Cl, and 79Br.\u000d\u000a    Professor John Smith led an active programme in NQR spectroscopy and\u000d\u000a      instrumentation development at King's College London from 1985 until his\u000d\u000a      death in 2013. His research was concerned with the development and\u000d\u000a      application of NQR methods, in particular 14N-NQR, to detect\u000d\u000a      signals from many solid explosives and drugs allowing unequivocal\u000d\u000a      identification and quantitative assessment. Research at KCL since 1993 led\u000d\u000a      to advances in pulsed NQR methods leading to shortened detection times and\u000d\u000a      enhanced sensitivity of detection of 14N frequencies, and\u000d\u000a      included NQR detection of explosives in vehicles, a study of the structure\u000d\u000a      and NQR spectrum of heroin hydrochloride, and the characterisation of\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical materials.\u000d\u000a    Since 2003 the research focus has been concerned with integrating NQR\u000d\u000a      with advanced detection and classification techniques, in a programme in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Professors Althoefer and Seneviratne in the Division of\u000d\u000a      Engineering (from 2010 the Department of Informatics). Since 2008 this\u000d\u000a      work was extended to new methods integrating Polarisation-Enhanced (PE)\u000d\u000a      NQR and NMR with advanced detection and classification techniques. Through\u000d\u000a      the development and introduction of stochastic excitation methods and\u000d\u000a      appropriate model-based data processing and classification techniques, the\u000d\u000a      KCL NQR group has successfully created NQR-based detectors capable of\u000d\u000a      detecting different explosives and drugs with significantly reduced\u000d\u000a      detection times compared to previous methods. Exploiting the low magnetic\u000d\u000a      fields used for PE-NQR, the group was able to successfully integrate NQR\u000d\u000a      with NMR to extend the detection from solids to liquid explosives.\u000d\u000a    The KCL NQR research programme has been supported by a range of sources\u000d\u000a      including industry.

As part of its mission to secure\u000d\u000a      a more sustainable future\u000d\u000a      by reducing the amount of waste glass, TGB also aims to provide employment\u000d\u000a      opportunities for\u000d\u000a      individuals that would normally be excluded from the workplace, for\u000d\u000a      example those with learning\u000d\u000a      difficulties and mental health issues.\u000d\u000a    The collaboration between DMAP and TGB includes a jointly-funded KESS PhD\u000d\u000a      project that\u000d\u000a      contributes to the use of coloured glass in TGB's products, such as the\u000d\u000a      development of a solar\u000d\u000a      water heater made from recycled glass. The connection between the\u000d\u000a      fundamental research on\u000d\u000a      colour centres and the optical properties of the recycled glass (and\u000d\u000a      simple analogues) allows the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of the heat transfer of solar radiation to be optimised.\u000d\u000a      Here a fundamental and\u000d\u000a      practical understanding of the optical and thermal properties of the\u000d\u000a      recycled glass is required; this\u000d\u000a      is coupled with advanced thermal and fluid-flow modelling, a level of\u000d\u000a      expertise and insight that has\u000d\u000a      not been previously available to this small company. Thus the KESS\u000d\u000a      partnership acts as an\u000d\u000a      enabler for impact as it enhances the level of communication between DMAP\u000d\u000a      researchers and\u000d\u000a      TGB.\u000d\u000a    Ten Green Bottles is able to benefit directly from access to DMAP\u000d\u000a      research into glasses and\u000d\u000a      liquids, which has enabled new processes and products to be developed. As\u000d\u000a      the CEO of Ten\u000d\u000a      Green Bottles acknowledges in a letter to one of the key DMAP researchers,\u000d\u000a      it is because of the\u000d\u000a      SME's `interaction with [DMAP that they have] been able to\u000d\u000a        benefit from direct access to physics\u000d\u000a        research' which has `provided an opportunity [...] to enhance\u000d\u000a      [TGB's] current business and also the\u000d\u000a        potential to develop new products, specifically the development, design\u000d\u000a        and manufacturing of solar\u000d\u000a        water heaters, made from recycled glass' [5.1] Thus the DMAP\u000d\u000a      research makes a major\u000d\u000a      contribution to the `tangible, economic advantage' [5.1]\u000d\u000a      acknowledged by Ten Green Bottles.\u000d\u000a    As a social enterprise, Ten Green Bottles has a direct and positive\u000d\u000a      impact on the community in\u000d\u000a      south Powys and its regeneration. In its capacity as one of the UK's\u000d\u000a      Community Interest\u000d\u000a      Companies (CIC), TGB offers workshops that allow participants to make\u000d\u000a      their own piece of\u000d\u000a      recycled glass, thus gaining an understanding of the process and\u000d\u000a      benefiting from the SME's\u000d\u000a      knowledge [5.2]. Ten Green Bottles CIC is also a recognised training\u000d\u000a      centre that offers community\u000d\u000a      members the opportunity to gain qualifications and to develop work skills,\u000d\u000a      which creates benefits\u000d\u000a      for socially challenged individuals as well as the long-term unemployed.\u000d\u000a      TGB's website states that\u000d\u000a      `previous trainees have been very successful with a high percentage\u000d\u000a        acquiring long term\u000d\u000a        employment after their time here.' [5.3]. It is therefore vital for\u000d\u000a      Ten Green Bottles to continually gain\u000d\u000a      further insight `into the atomic scale structure of their aesthetically\u000d\u000a        pleasing materials' [5.1]. The\u000d\u000a      CEO of Ten Green Bottles also states that `The research and development\u000d\u000a        into coloured glasses\u000d\u000a        not only provides [the] social enterprise with a strong\u000d\u000a        commercial foundation but in a wider sense\u000d\u000a        will provide [the SME] with the knowledge and insight into the\u000d\u000a        use of recycled materials such that\u000d\u000a      [Ten Green Bottles] can contribute and inform the sustainability and\u000d\u000a        environmental debate' [5.1].\u000d\u000a    Including socially challenged individuals as well as student volunteers,\u000d\u000a      the diversity of Ten Green\u000d\u000a      Bottles' workforce underscores the SME's CIC mission which is promoted\u000d\u000a      through a number of\u000d\u000a      events including presentations and visits to other countries. This is\u000d\u000a      exemplified in the SME's recent\u000d\u000a      visit to the Czech Republic, which proved beneficial to one of the student\u000d\u000a      volunteers. As part of its\u000d\u000a      mission Ten Green Bottles is `pleased to offer a forum for students to\u000d\u000a        understand business with\u000d\u000a        social values and enterprise that is sustainable.' [5.1]. It is\u000d\u000a      through its ties with academic\u000d\u000a      researchers, strengthened by the KESS studentship that contributes to the\u000d\u000a      knowledge transfer\u000d\u000a      between DMAP and Ten Green Bottles, that the SME can be `recognised as\u000d\u000a        having research\u000d\u000a        innovation and design at the heart of [their] business'\u000d\u000a      [5.1]. Considering Ten Green Bottles' efforts\u000d\u000a      to support those who work for the SME, a major success of the knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer between DMAP\u000d\u000a      and Ten Green Bottles is that it `introduced [Ten Green Bottles'] workforce\u000d\u000a        and volunteers to\u000d\u000a        academia and extended their ambitions to higher education.'

The broader research programme into glass, glass-forming liquids\u000d\u000a      and amorphous materials\u000d\u000a      at Aberystwyth University involves the use of neutron and high energy\u000d\u000a      X-ray diffraction. The\u000d\u000a      structures of liquids and glasses change under extremes of temperature and\u000d\u000a      pressure and new\u000d\u000a      techniques (high flux, high energy X-rays and aerodynamic levitation [3.2,\u000d\u000a      3.3]) have been\u000d\u000a      developed to allow a connection to be made between transient metastable\u000d\u000a      structures and\u000d\u000a      structure-dependent properties such as viscosity. This connection also\u000d\u000a      allows the local\u000d\u000a      environment around colour centres to be established.\u000d\u000a    Although coloured glasses have been available for centuries, a detailed\u000d\u000a      understanding of the\u000d\u000a      physics of colour is a more recent development. The colour reflects the\u000d\u000a      local environment around\u000d\u000a      transition metal ions (crystal-field effects) or nanophase gold or silver\u000d\u000a      particles. Coloured glasses\u000d\u000a      are beneficial in many applications because they are cheap, they contain\u000d\u000a      no organic material, the\u000d\u000a      colour centres are dispersed throughout the glass host and the glass hosts\u000d\u000a      themselves are\u000d\u000a      sufficiently robust to be able to withstand climatic and radiative\u000d\u000a      extremes [3.4]. Coloured glasses\u000d\u000a      are therefore of interest in a variety of applications, including their\u000d\u000a      potential to be used as\u000d\u000a      calibration targets for the ExoMars 2016 and 2018 missions; this is the\u000d\u000a      subject of an on-going\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary research programme between DMAP and the Department of\u000d\u000a      Computer Science at\u000d\u000a      Aberystwyth University [3.5].\u000d\u000a    The optical properties of these glasses that provide strong colour can be\u000d\u000a      measured and modelled\u000d\u000a      using spectroscopic techniques and X-ray absorption measurements and this\u000d\u000a      is one focus of a\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship (KESS) established between DMAP and\u000d\u000a      the social\u000d\u000a      enterprise Ten Green Bottles (TGB) in 2011, in which TGB sponsor a current\u000d\u000a      PhD student.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42093","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 2010, DMAP staff successfully influenced working of the young people's\u000d\u000a      organisation, Urdd Gobaith Cymru in relation to science activities at\u000d\u000a      their annual National Eisteddfod festival for young people.

Having run for almost a century, it has wide media\u000d\u000a      coverage, reaching an additional audience on television and radio.\u000d\u000a    In 2010 the Urdd Eisteddfod was held on the Llanerchaeron estate in West\u000d\u000a      Wales, close to Aberystwyth. In the preceding years, the movement had\u000d\u000a      decided not to support science activities at the Eisteddfod site and, in\u000d\u000a      response, Pryse and Morgan established a group involving universities, the\u000d\u000a      IoP and local organisations to provide leadership for the local and\u000d\u000a      national campaign to reinstate science into this large and popular event.\u000d\u000a      This is confirmed in a letter from the Urdd Co-ordinator of the Eisteddfod\u000d\u000a      and the Arts, who said \"...there were no plans to hold science\u000d\u000a        activities in the Eisteddfod in Llanerchaeron before discussions were\u000d\u000a        held with Aberystwyth University\" [5.1]). The group grew into a\u000d\u000a      science committee, chaired by Pryse, that was recognised by the movement\u000d\u000a      through senior representation; it was also recognised by the Institute of\u000d\u000a      Physics through membership and significant support of its national\u000d\u000a      co-ordinator for Wales.\u000d\u000a    The key enabling factor was the establishment of a central exhibition\u000d\u000a      drawing from the research excellence of Aberystwyth researchers in the\u000d\u000a      physics of the Sun and the Solar System. This excellence, combined with a\u000d\u000a      track record of outreach from the department and our partners, attracted\u000d\u000a      funding from STFC to ensure a professional centre-point to the exhibit.\u000d\u000a      Building on this, further participation was attracted from bodies such as\u000d\u000a      Techniquest, the British Science Association, BBC Breathing Places,\u000d\u000a      Institute of Physics in Wales, and the Royal Society of Chemistry. The\u000d\u000a      scale and variety of the exhibit persuaded the central organising\u000d\u000a      committee of the Urdd to re-introduce science to the festival in the form\u000d\u000a      of the Science Pavilion proposed by the committee.

The group has a long and\u000d\u000a      successful history of analysing data from many space missions and\u000d\u000a      ground-based facilities and developing novel methods and models to\u000d\u000a      interpret the observations.\u000d\u000a    The energy that drives space weather throughout the heliosphere\u000d\u000a      ultimately comes from the solar interior. It is therefore essential to\u000d\u000a      investigate the processes for energy and mass transport between the Sun's\u000d\u000a      interior, photosphere and atmosphere. The group has researched this\u000d\u000a      environment by analysing observations from missions such as the Solar\u000d\u000a      Dynamic Observatory and Hinode and by developing new analytical and\u000d\u000a      numerical models and simulations. Novel image processing and analysis have\u000d\u000a      led to new discoveries of the corona including the unexpected expansion of\u000d\u000a      active regions into the solar wind, and the first direct measurements of\u000d\u000a      coronal rotation rates. A recent highlight was our discovery of a huge\u000d\u000a      solar tornado [3.1] which captured the imagination of the science media.\u000d\u000a    Further from the Sun, the research included the development of novel\u000d\u000a      automated methods to study large solar eruptions in the extended corona,\u000d\u000a      and analysis of satellite and radio observations of the solar wind and\u000d\u000a      planetary ionospheres. This breadth of expertise enabled a unique picture\u000d\u000a      of the influence of space weather on the planetary environments [3.2 -\u000d\u000a      3.4]. The structure and composition of planetary and lunar surfaces have\u000d\u000a      also featured prominently in our research [3.5].\u000d\u000a    With the launch of the STEREO NASA spacecraft in 2006, members of the\u000d\u000a      research group took the opportunity to produce a 3D movie of the first\u000d\u000a      solar images sent by the two STEREO cameras viewing from two different\u000d\u000a      angles. The stereo images were generated at Aberystwyth even before NASA\u000d\u000a      had processed the data. Animating the data in this way, using advanced\u000d\u000a      visualisation techniques, aids the scientist's understanding of the\u000d\u000a      complicated structures which form the dynamic solar atmosphere. For public\u000d\u000a      outreach the visualisation is extremely useful, particularly with a target\u000d\u000a      audience of adults and young people. Interactive exhibits and\u000d\u000a      presentations at schools and festivals have included the National\u000d\u000a      Eisteddfod of Wales in 2009 with funding obtained from the RAS [3.6] and\u000d\u000a      the Urdd National Eisteddfod in 2010 with funding from the STFC [3.7].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42248","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As part of the research and development of FLIM technology, the Imperial\u000d\u000a      group has worked closely with several industrial partners, including\u000d\u000a      Kentech Instruments Ltd, AstraZeneca, GE Healthcare, GSK and PerkinElmer.\u000d\u000a      This resulted in several papers being co-authored with industry [1-4]\u000d\u000a      which raised the profile of time-gated FLIM and helped to establish a\u000d\u000a      market for this technology.

FLIM is the measurement of fluorescence lifetime\u000d\u000a      in every pixel of an image and was first implemented in microscopes,\u000d\u000a      although now it has been extended to endoscopy, tomography and other\u000d\u000a      imaging modalities. Although fluorescence lifetime measurements date back\u000d\u000a      decades, FLIM was first demonstrated around 1990 but was not widely taken\u000d\u000a      up because of the complexity of the technology required. The Imperial\u000d\u000a      group demonstrated one of the first \"practical\" FLIM instruments in 1997\u000d\u000a      [1, 2] using wide-field time-gated imaging with a prototype gated image\u000d\u000a      intensifier (GOI) and a home-built novel solid-state ultrafast laser\u000d\u000a      source that replaced complex and cumbersome ultrafast dye laser systems.\u000d\u000a      It also developed suitable software tools to analyse FLIM data since none\u000d\u000a      were commercially available. Subsequently it demonstrated the potential\u000d\u000a      for applications in biomedicine (e.g. cell biology using FRET to read out\u000d\u000a      cell signalling processes [3] and for clinical diagnosis [5]), high\u000d\u000a      content analysis for drug discovery [e.g. 4] and in the physical sciences.\u000d\u000a      This work has underpinned the impact of time-gated FLIM in the wider user\u000d\u000a      community and helped establish a market for the technology.\u000d\u000a    Research by Professor French's group included demonstrating the initial\u000d\u000a      practical system in 1997 [1,2] and subsequently refining it, and\u000d\u000a      integrating novel laser sources with gated optical image intensifiers\u000d\u000a      (GOI) in FLIM instrumentation. This work was initiated and has continued\u000d\u000a      with close interaction with industry, particularly Kentech Instruments Ltd\u000d\u000a      but also AstraZeneca, GE Healthcare, GSK and PerkinElmer. The Imperial\u000d\u000a      group co-authored several papers with industry [1-4] that raised the\u000d\u000a      profile of time-gated FLIM.\u000d\u000a    The group has continued to develop novel FLIM instrumentation. It\u000d\u000a      demonstrated FLIM using a high repetition rate gated image intensifier\u000d\u000a      operating at ~80 MHz with a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser and this\u000d\u000a      approach has become wide-spread. In 2004, the group also demonstrated the\u000d\u000a      potential for rapid FLIM endoscopy using the Kentech GOI technology and\u000d\u000a      also demonstrated the first FLIM with an ultrafast supercontinuum source\u000d\u000a      (USS) [6], which, in turn, stimulated the market for USS. They have also\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the potential for rapid imaging in microfluidic devices using\u000d\u000a      GOI FLIM in 2005 and the extension of the technique to wide-field\u000d\u000a      time-resolved fluorescence anistropy imaging.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers: Prof Paul French (Head of Photonics group) has led the\u000d\u000a      FLIM development and application since initiating it in 1996, later\u000d\u000a      working with Prof Mark Neil (Professor of Photonics), Dr Christopher\u000d\u000a      Dunsby (Lecturer in Photonics) and Dr James McGinty (Lecturer in\u000d\u000a      Biophotonics).

The\u000a      company's goal is \"to make 3-D microscopy accessible and affordable to\u000a        the masses &#8212; to individual researchers, not just imaging facilities in\u000a        large institutions\" [B]. Aurox products use lower cost light sources\u000a      than competitors and do not require a scanning system which sets them\u000a      apart from other microscopes. The company testifies that Imperial research\u000a      carried out by Prof Mark Neil's group has \"directly influenced\u000a        developments and improvements to Aurox products\" and, in particular,\u000a      the research in paper [3] has led to \"a better understanding of optical\u000a        sectioning in the Aurox SD62 series of microscopes\". This has\u000a      enabled the company to optimise the microscopes performance \"to better\u000a        accommodate end user requirements\" [B].\u000a    Since 2008 Aurox has sold more than 150 units with market value in excess\u000a      of &#163;3M [B]. The \"majority of these sales have been since 2010 when the\u000a        optimisation step described in paper [3] was incorporated into [their]\u000a        products\" [B]. The sales have been made through distributers Carl\u000a      Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, who market the products as VivatomeTM [C,\u000a      D], and Andor Technology PLC, who market it as Revolution DSDTM [E].\u000a      In the case of both customers it was initial feedback from beta-site\u000a      testing with end users that pointed to the need for a fuller understanding\u000a      of the impact of disk pattern design on the competing requirements of\u000a      optical section strength and signal level. That understanding was provided\u000a      by the research undertaken at Imperial described above and which informed\u000a      the design of new disk patterns that was a crucial step in the development\u000a      of the eventual systems that went to market [B].\u000a    As distributers both Carl Zeiss and Andor (headquartered in Germany and\u000a      Northern Ireland respectively) have in turn benefitted from the addition\u000a      of Aurox units to their fluorescence microscopy product lines, providing a\u000a      low cost optical sectioning microscopy solution that is capable of\u000a      operation at relatively high speed. In Carl Zeiss this has filled a niche\u000a      at the low cost end of their already extensive product line, effectively\u000a      phasing out their previous ApoTomeTM product. Within Andor this\u000a      has formed part of a concerted effort to expand from a small, but\u000a      successful, scientific camera manufacturer to a worldwide supplier of\u000a      complete optical microscopy systems. In marketing the Revolution DSDTM\u000a        Andor Technology PLC has \"made significant use of the research\u000a        in paper [3] to help explain the operation of the Revolution DSD through\u000a        both webinars and other promotional material\" [B]. As end users,\u000a      biomedical scientists find that with a low cost and relatively compact\u000a      device such as this they are no longer held up in their work by waiting\u000a      for access to centralised facilities where more expensive and bulky laser\u000a      scanning microscope systems are often sited, and that they can now access\u000a      some of the same functionality as provided by such traditional microscope\u000a      systems in their own laboratories.\u000a    Through the development of first-generation systems with Carl Zeiss,\u000a      Aurox was awarded R&amp;D 100 award in 2010 [F]. Most recently, in May\u000a      2012, Aurox received a Queen's award for innovation [G] and an Institute\u000a      of Physics Innovation Prize [H] in October 2012. All of these awards were\u000a      based on the success of the first-generation systems that benefited from\u000a      the Imperial research highlighted here [B].\u000a    As a result of the success of the first generation systems produced by\u000a      Aurox, it is currently actively involved in the development of a second\u000a      generation of systems that will both improve on overall performance for\u000a      existing customers Carl Zeiss and Andor, and expand their respective\u000a      customer bases in new directions. The design of the second generation of\u000a      microscopes produced by Aurox continues to be, in part, underpinned by the\u000a      analysis developed in paper [3] [B].\u000a    Aurox continues to work with Prof Neil's research group at Imperial to\u000a      develop the next generation of microscopes. An example of the continued\u000a      collaboration is Aurox's role as the industrial\/commercial sponsor an\u000a      EPSRC DTA\/CASE award which has been held at Imperial since October 2010\u000a      [B, I]. The student Lionel Fafchamps is working under the supervision of\u000a      Prof Mark Neil at Imperial and industrial supervisor Dr Rimas Juskaitis at\u000a      Aurox on further developments to spinning disk pattern design to include\u000a      more complex patterns that can mitigate some of the residual artefacts of\u000a      simple line patterns, and the behaviour of systems using such masks in\u000a      bright field microscopy such as are used in material inspection\u000a      applications. A particularly interesting recent development under this\u000a      program has been in mask designs that give significant improvements in\u000a      resolution for fluorescence systems. It is expected that these\u000a      developments will feed into the second and future generation systems under\u000a      development at Aurox.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Aurox Ltd is an Oxfordshire spin-out company formed in 2004 by Prof Mark\u000a      Neil (at Imperial since August 2002) with former colleagues from Oxford\u000a      University. Its main product line consists of wide field optical\u000a      sectioning fluorescence microscopes based on the principle of structured\u000a      illumination and detection using patterned disks. The microscopes use\u000a      conventional (lower cost) light sources and do not require a scanning\u000a      system which sets them apart from competitors.

The significant\u000a      steps in the research were undertaken wholly at Imperial by Prof Mark Neil\u000a      and his research team.\u000a    Key personnel:\u000a    \u000a      Mark Neil, Professor of Photonics (2009-present), previously lecturer\u000a        and reader (since 2002), Physics Department, Imperial College London\u000a      Paul French, Professor of Photonics, Head of Photonics Group, Physics\u000a        Department, at Imperial 01\/10\/89-present.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42250","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research outlined above, continuously developed over a period of more\u000a      than a decade, has introduced a new paradigm to electromagnetic studies in\u000a      general, impacting the electromagnetic spectrum from static fields to\u000a      optical frequencies. The work has since resulted in numerous interactions\u000a      with commercial and government organisations. Pendry has personally\u000a      consulted on metamaterials for BAE Systems (2008-9), The Marconi Company\u000a      (1996-2000), Thales (2009), Defence Science and Technology Laboratory\u000a      (DSTL, 2012-), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB, 2011), the US Air\u000a      Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), EADS (2008), Kodak (2007-11),\u000a      Intellectual Ventures (2004-), and Corning (1999-2000). These radical new\u000a      concepts are now filtering through into products.\u000a    KYMETA Corporation\u000a    Intellectual Ventures developed a satcom device in 2010-11 that is an\u000a      order of magnitude cheaper than current products with a target marketing\u000a      price of $500 and operates from the USB port of a laptop. The company had\u000a      been interested in applications of metamaterials for some time [A] and in\u000a      2010 began to explore, in earnest, what \"markets could be penetrated or\u000a        created through the integration of metamaterials-based designs\" [B].\u000a      Its main focus was on the development of flat-panel reconfigurable\u000a      antennas. In this area it was able to \"leverage the work [Pendry had]\u000a        done in metamaterials\" [B]. Specific areas of influence included\u000a      resonant element design and numerical tools which help to predict system\u000a      response; such as homogenization techniques. Pairing these toolsets with\u000a      newly developed techniques in reconfigurable metamaterials, holographic\u000a      metamaterials and high-efficiency system design and fabrication resulted\u000a      in a \"new technology\" referred to as Metamaterial Surface Antenna\u000a      Technology (MSA-T) [B, C, D]. This \"technology has many applications,\u000a        but the first target for Intellectual Ventures (IV) was selected to be\u000a        the satellite industry\" [B]. In \"an effort to exploit this\u000a        opportunity, IV spun off a new company, Kymeta Corporation\" [B].\u000a      Kymeta is currently (Aug 2013) over a year into its existence as an\u000a      independent entity and \"has attracted significant interest in its\u000a        industry; including large development contracts from leading satellite\u000a        service providers\" [B]. Kymeta has 56 full time employees (as of\u000a      July 2013) and is continuously hiring [K] and was formed with $12M in\u000a      investment funding from Bill Gates, Lux Capital and cable company Liberty\u000a      Global [E, F].\u000a    By using metamaterials, the antenna will be able to electronically tune\u000a      the array \"to point and steer a radio signal toward a satellite\",\u000a      creating \"an unbroken broadband link to whatever device is carrying the\u000a        antenna&#8212;whether it's a boat, plane, or laptop\" [F]. The\u000a      company's first product will be \"a portable, laptop-sized antenna that\u000a        gives you an instant Internet hotspot anywhere in the world\" [F],\u000a      with an ultimate application allowing \"cheap and fast Internet\u000a        connections on airplanes, trains, buses, cruise ships, and military\u000a        vehicles\" [F]. Intellectual Ventures says the company's first\u000a      customers will likely be mining and defence [F]. In addition, a\u000a      spokesperson at Kymeta said: \"the device has potential benefits for\u000a        news reporters in the field, emergency responders in disaster areas, or\u000a        even just average consumers looking to untether from public Wi-Fi and\u000a        mobile broadband signals\" [G].\u000a    Kymeta, based in Washington state, expects to have its first products\u000a      commercially available in 2015 [H]. It has already attracted significant\u000a      interest in its industry including \"large development contracts from\u000a        leading satellite service providers\" [B]. Intellectual Ventures\u000a      continues to invest in new application areas for MSA-T and metamaterials\u000a      technology more broadly in a variety of application areas [B].\u000a    BAE Systems\u000a    BAE Systems has shown a longstanding interest in metamaterials,\u000a      originating with the work with Marconi (now part of BAE) in the 1990s, and\u000a      is looking to apply the principles behind metamaterials and transformation\u000a      optics in several areas. The techniques from the work between Pendry and\u000a      Marconi \"have been used within missile seekers for RF filters and\u000a        reflectors, and in \"stealth\" applications where frequency dependent\u000a        absorption &amp; filtering built into a structure is useful\" [I].\u000a      Acknowledging Pendry's role in the area of metamaterials, BAE Systems\u000a      states that \"essentially, you have fathered a whole area of scientific\u000a        and engineering endeavour\" [I]. A further application of\u000a      metamaterials by BAE is that in antennas, particularly making antennas\u000a      much more compact with increased directionality. Such developments are \"very\u000a        significant in designing small, compact antennas for small platforms\u000a        including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and small antennas to work at very\u000a        low frequencies, for example for submarines\" [I].\u000a    A study for the European Defence Agency (EDA) on Active Camouflage and\u000a      cloaking informed BAE of the difficulties in using transformation optic\u000a      approaches to hide a complex object, which in turn gave very good\u000a      indications of \"what might be practical for military applications\".\u000a      As a result BAE's studies \"have looked at extending the potential uses\u000a        of metamaterials and the transformation optics approach into [the]\u000a        underwater acoustics domain\" [I]. A further area of application for\u000a      BAE which is being considered is in counter IED blast protection, with\u000a      metamaterials structures potentially being able to divert a blast wave\u000a      around an object.\u000a    BAE comments on the significant level of activity worldwide relating to\u000a      metamaterials. It monitors the literature and patents arising in this area\u000a      (particularly those with relevance to a company like BAE Systems) and has\u000a      noted that a very significant level of work is being undertaken in the USA\u000a      as well as a significant level in China.\u000a    US Department of the Air Force and Office of Scientific Research\u000a        (AFOSR)\u000a    In 2006 Pendry participated in an AFOSR-sponsored collaboration with\u000a      David Smith at Duke University. Since then research in metamaterials has\u000a      exploded and as a granting agency this is reflected in the AFOSR's records\u000a      which \"presently include over thirty grants listing \"metamaterials\" as\u000a        a keyword, totalling over $11 million in funding, on projects ranging\u000a        from cloaking to plasmonics, particle-based nanoantennas, implementation\u000a        of electrically-controlled metamaterials, and a great deal more\"\u000a      [J]. The US Air Force's interest in the subject is a direct result of\u000a      engagement with Prof Pendry and the results of his previous research [J].\u000a    Pendry actively engaged with AFOSR and related offices such as the Air\u000a      Force Research Labs (AFRL), visiting the labs on a number of occasions and\u000a      conferring with them on basic research tasks. His \"consultation was\u000a        directly responsible for advances in an AFRL program to develop\u000a        conformal antenna arrays, using RF-photonic elements to sample incident\u000a        fields and embed them on an optical carrier\" [J]. This allowed\u000a      flexible beam forming, imaging, and other applications, in addition to\u000a      improved electromagnetic interference resistance. Pendry's \"recent work\u000a        on broad band light harvesting structures was directly applied to that\u000a        [AFRL] program to yield improved bandwidth and overall efficiency,\u000a        resulting in a recent demonstration of a first-of-its-kind metamaterial\u000a        conformal RF-photonic array\" [J]. The AFOSR testifies that the\u000a      contributions of Pendry and his group have had \"considerable impact\"\u000a      on the organisation.\u000a    Widespread impact\u000a    Almost every major organisation concerned with electromagnetism has a\u000a      shown interest in this field. The impact of metamaterials is widespread\u000a      with many thousands of references in the scientific and popular press and\u000a      on television. For example, there was an article on the BBC discussing\u000a      Pendry's research and its application in the development of an\u000a      invisibility cloak [K].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Metamaterials deliver electromagnetic properties not available in natural\u000a      materials.

These powerful concepts, originally developed by Prof\u000a      John Pendry, have engendered massive interest in the electromagnetic\u000a      community encompassing radio frequency (RF) through to optical\u000a      applications. His advice is sought by numerous companies and these\u000a      concepts are now filtering through into products.

These concepts\u000a      have been extensively patented both by The Marconi Company and by\u000a      Intellectual Ventures, with Pendry's name appearing on more than 70\u000a      patents in the field [P1].\u000a    The project began with the consultancy at Marconi, during the course of\u000a      which Pendry realised that electromagnetic properties of materials were as\u000a      much influenced by their structure as by their chemical composition [1,\u000a      2]. The name metamaterials was later applied to the concept by others.\u000a      Naturally occurring material properties available are somewhat limited and\u000a      properties such as negative refraction can only be accessed via\u000a      metamaterials. The same is true of magnetism at optical frequencies which\u000a      Landau claimed did not exist but can now be created using metamaterials.\u000a    Negative refraction, first postulated by Veselago in 1968 and only\u000a      realised once metamaterials were available, is a remarkable phenomenon\u000a      introducing many new ideas into optics. For example Pendry showed in 2000\u000a      [3] that using negative refraction it is possible to build a lens whose\u000a      resolution is not limited by the wavelength. Nanometre scale objects have\u000a      subsequently been imaged by such a device and this paper, cited more than\u000a      4,000 times, has given birth to the present intense interest in the sub\u000a      wavelength control of light.\u000a    Transformation optics had its origin in research Pendry conducted at\u000a      Imperial in the mid 1990's and early 2000's and took a sabbatical during\u000a      2002-2003 to focus on metamaterials during this critical period. This\u000a      research was most famously was used to design a cloak of invisibility in\u000a      2006 [4] which was rapidly translated, using metamaterials, into an\u000a      experimental realisation [5]. Transformation optics replaces the ray\u000a      picture of Snell's law with the field lines of Maxwell's equations and is\u000a      an exact description of classical optics, but retains the intuitive\u000a      advantage of Snell. Valid on all length scales it provides an intuitive\u000a      design paradigm that has variously been employed to construct novel RF\u000a      devices and sub wavelength optical systems [6].\u000a    The underpinning research on metamaterials and transformation optics is\u000a      highly theoretical but has been translated into experiment and into\u000a      working devices by others who have taken up these concepts and applied\u000a      them. An extensive collaboration exists with Professor David Smith at Duke\u000a      University in the USA. His group specialises in the experimental\u000a      realisation of the metamaterial concept and has extensive involvement with\u000a      companies such as Toyota, Boeing, and Intellectual Ventures, as well as\u000a      with DARPA, the CIA and the US military.\u000a    The research was funded from numerous sources including EPSRC, the\u000a      Leverhulme Trust, DSTL, the European Commission, AFOSR and Kodak.\u000a    List of patents arising involving John Pendry, many of which\u000a      arise from the work described above: http:\/\/www.patentmaps.com\/inventor\/John_Brian_Pendry_1.html\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42251","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research in [1-3] provided both the original observation that\u000d\u000a      \"natural nanostructure\" could be\u000d\u000a      probed with enough repeatability using a relatively simple and inexpensive\u000d\u000a      laser geometry as well\u000d\u000a      as the physical understanding of the scattering mechanism required to\u000d\u000a      translate this laboratory\u000d\u000a      observation into a proper technology that could be deployed into\u000d\u000a      real-world settings.\u000d\u000a    The impact was secured by Imperial forming a partnership with the\u000d\u000a      investment company Ingenia\u000d\u000a      Holding Ltd (formed in 2003) which provided both the research funding\u000d\u000a      required and the\u000d\u000a      technology transfer know-how to fully launch the company, to engineer\u000d\u000a      products and to form\u000d\u000a      business partnerships.

Without the close relationship between the physics research within\u000d\u000a      Imperial and those trying\u000d\u000a      to commercialise the technology at Ingenia Technology, success would not\u000d\u000a      have been possible.\u000d\u000a      Dr P Seem joined the Ingenia team after graduating in 2009 and Drs S\u000d\u000a      Buehlmann and JDR\u000d\u000a      Buchanan joined after leaving Imperial in 2010 [A].\u000d\u000a    Ingenia Technology now employs seven people in total [A]. Its\u000d\u000a      headquarters are in the City of\u000d\u000a      London and it also has offices in Vienna and Zurich. It is part of the\u000d\u000a      NewScope Group, a Swiss-\u000d\u000a      based, privately funded business, comprising a number of specialist\u000d\u000a      high-end technology\u000d\u000a      companies. The Ingenia team consists of a mix of business and security\u000d\u000a      experts and of specialist\u000d\u000a      engineers and physicists with many years of experience in electronic and\u000d\u000a      product engineering and\u000d\u000a      includes three members of the original research team from Imperial College\u000d\u000a      [B].\u000d\u000a    Ingenia currently offers several main products including line and field\u000d\u000a      scanners, and LSAControl\u000d\u000a      and LSANet software [A, C]. The research at Imperial contributed, either\u000d\u000a      directly or indirectly, to the\u000d\u000a      development of these products [A]. Ingenia supplies these solutions to\u000d\u000a      luxury product\u000d\u000a      manufacturers, carton producers (e.g. CARTONDRUCK, Grafiche Bramucci),\u000d\u000a      precious metal\u000d\u000a      refiners (PAMP), one of the world's largest perfume manufacturers,\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical firms (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Bayer [D]), government agencies (e.g. International Atomic Energy Agency,\u000d\u000a      IAEA) and national\u000d\u000a      laboratories, as detailed below. These projects have ranged in value from\u000d\u000a      &#163;20,000 to &#163;200,000\u000d\u000a      each [A].\u000d\u000a    With the IAEA Ingenia developed the LSA system to \"extract an intrinsic\u000d\u000a      material signature from\u000d\u000a      both the copper and brass parts of the IAEA CAPS metal seal\" [E]. The LSA\u000d\u000a      system \"has been\u000d\u000a      delivered and tested to meet IAEA specification for usability and\u000d\u000a      accuracy\" [E]. The technique will\u000d\u000a      augment and potentially replace the subjective imagery analysis method of\u000d\u000a      comparing metal seal\u000d\u000a      optical images that are currently used, thereby providing strong\u000d\u000a      protection against counterfeiting.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, Ingenia signed a partnership agreement with IDT, a leading 2D\u000d\u000a      and 3D in-surface\u000d\u000a      decoration systems provider, allowing IDT to offer Ingenia's LSA\u000d\u000a      technology to its customers.\u000d\u000a      \"Working with Ingenia Technology will allow us to offer a much more\u000d\u000a      comprehensive authentication\u000d\u000a      and identification package for our customers,\" commented Peter Woodd, CEO\u000d\u000a      of IDT Systems.\u000d\u000a      \"Ingenia's LSA technology is the most robust and sophisticated solution\u000d\u000a      for product tracing and\u000d\u000a      anti-counterfeiting that we have seen in the marketplace, making it a\u000d\u000a      perfect complement to our\u000d\u000a      existing D Series system technology\" [F].\u000d\u000a    In 2010 a partnership with CARTONDRUCK, a leading worldwide manufacturer\u000d\u000a      of high-quality\u000d\u000a      cartons, was announced, \"supporting movement into the luxury goods market\"\u000d\u000a      [G]. This agreement\u000d\u000a      allows \"Germany-based CARTONDRUCK, a manufacturer of high quality boxes\u000d\u000a      for the cosmetic\u000d\u000a      and fragrance industry...to offer Ingenia Technology's Laser Surface\u000d\u000a      Authentication (LSA) anti-\u000d\u000a      counterfeiting technology as a service to its customers\" [D]. The cartons\u000d\u000a      are used by\u000d\u000a      CARTONDRUCK's customers to authenticate and track their products. The most\u000d\u000a      important\u000d\u000a      function in this market is to combat diversion of products from one\u000d\u000a      country to another and sale of\u000d\u000a      products by unauthorised retailers. The \"agreement will also see both\u000d\u000a      companies partnering to\u000d\u000a      promote LSA technology more broadly to empower owners of high value brands\u000d\u000a      with an effective\u000d\u000a      tool for fighting counterfeiting and smuggling\" [H].\u000d\u000a    In 2013 a similar deal was announced with luxury carton manufacturer\u000d\u000a      Grafiche Bramucci,\u000d\u000a      enabling Grafiche Bramucci to provide clients in cosmetics, fragrance and\u000d\u000a      luxury products\u000d\u000a      customers with access to Ingenia's LSA technology. Grafiche Bramucci has\u000d\u000a      installed Ingenia's\u000d\u000a      scanning and coding system as part of what it describes as a\u000d\u000a      \"comprehensive anti-counterfeiting\u000d\u000a      and anti-diversion initiative\" [I]. Commenting on the deal, Francesca\u000d\u000a      Bramucci, director and owner\u000d\u000a      of Grafiche Bramucci, said \"With the rise of illicit trade within the\u000d\u000a      luxury sector and given our\u000d\u000a      prestigious customer portfolio, it is vital that Grafiche Bramucci is able\u000d\u000a      to offer the very best\u000d\u000a      solutions for anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion\" [I]. The Italian\u000d\u000a      firm counts a number of luxury\u000d\u000a      goods companies among its clients, including Garnier, Giorgio Armani,\u000d\u000a      Lancome, Moschino and\u000d\u000a      Versace, as well as other premium brands such as Campari [I].\u000d\u000a    Ingenia has developed a complete authentication system for precious\u000d\u000a      metals with leading Swiss\u000d\u000a      refiner PAMP, the world's leading bullion brand. This Veriscan&#8482; system\u000d\u000a      uses Ingenia's LSA\u000d\u000a      system to scan and code every gold and silver bar produced by PAMP and\u000d\u000a      then enables\u000d\u000a      authentication by multiple users across the world. According to the PAMP\u000d\u000a      press release, \"PAMP,\u000d\u000a      the renowned industry innovator, once again transforms the world of\u000d\u000a      precious metals by\u000d\u000a      introducing the latest in Laser Surface Authentication technology:\u000d\u000a      VeriScan&#8482;.

Ingenia hosts the secure\u000d\u000a      database for PAMP and has\u000d\u000a      developed a customised version of their hardware and software for them.\u000d\u000a    The practical value and novel benefit of Ingenia's LSA technology was\u000d\u000a      nicely described in an\u000d\u000a      Economist article in 2011. The article describes the novel \"tamper-proof\u000d\u000a      method of \"laser surface\u000d\u000a      authentication\"....developed initially at Imperial College, London\" [K].\u000d\u000a      The \"fast, low-cost\" method is\u000d\u000a      praised and described [K]:\u000d\u000a    - \"Nor is the system easy to fool.

In August 2005, after\u000d\u000a      moving to Imperial, Cowburn\u000d\u000a      published a paper in Nature [1] showing how the same optical geometry\u000d\u000a      could be reconfigured to\u000d\u000a      allow non-magnetic information with nanometre sensitivity to be extracted\u000d\u000a      and how this could be\u000d\u000a      used to probe the \"natural nanostructure\" (surface morphology) present in\u000d\u000a      paper and other\u000d\u000a      surfaces. With LSA, a surface is illuminated with normally incident laser\u000d\u000a      light that scans across the\u000d\u000a      surface. Photodetectors then capture photons that have been diffusely\u000d\u000a      scattered while not seeing\u000d\u000a      those that are specularly scattered. It is the fluctuations in this\u000d\u000a      diffusely scattered intensity as the\u000d\u000a      laser probe is scanned across the surface that is related to the\u000d\u000a      underlying physical structure.\u000d\u000a      Ingenia Technology was born out of this finding.\u000d\u000a    The initial observation and realisation of its potential use, was made\u000d\u000a      prior to Professor Cowburn\u000d\u000a      moving to Imperial, but the physical origin of the effect was incorrectly\u000d\u000a      interpreted in [1]. It was only\u000d\u000a      after further research entirely carried out at Imperial College after\u000d\u000a      August 2005 by Professor\u000d\u000a      Cowburn and his team (equivalent to 16 research years of basic physics\u000d\u000a      research), that the\u000d\u000a      phenomena was understood properly, and only on this basis was it possible\u000d\u000a      to develop the\u000d\u000a      instrumentation used today within Ingenia that is responsible for the\u000d\u000a      impact reported here.\u000d\u000a    Research performed for paper [2] and PR Seem's PhD thesis (2009) proved\u000d\u000a      key in helping to\u000d\u000a      understand the physical mechanism that links surface morphology to the\u000d\u000a      random optical intensity\u000d\u000a      variations which are actually recorded. In paper [1] that mechanism was\u000d\u000a      described as laser\u000d\u000a      speckle; paper [2] disproved that and showed it to be an incoherent\u000d\u000a      scattering similar to that known\u000d\u000a      as `clutter' in radar signals over sea water. This information radically\u000d\u000a      changed the design of the\u000d\u000a      laser heads - specifically, the team learned that it was necessary to\u000d\u000a      maximise the numerical\u000d\u000a      aperture of the receiving optics in order to minimise speckle. This was\u000d\u000a      the very opposite of what\u000d\u000a      had been initially thought of as the best way to design sensor heads\u000d\u000a      because the effect was\u000d\u000a      originally interpreted as due to laser speckle. In this way, the work at\u000d\u000a      Imperial College represents a\u000d\u000a      fundamental contribution to the technology.\u000d\u000a    Patent [3] describes a complete system for protecting the identity of\u000d\u000a      goods and documents,\u000d\u000a      involving an enrolment stage in which laser scattering is used to capture\u000d\u000a      a (i) unique signature, (ii)\u000d\u000a      all of the digital signal processing that has to be applied to the signal\u000d\u000a      to make it useful and robust,\u000d\u000a      (iii) the required database architecture and (iv) a validation stage in\u000d\u000a      which a second laser scan is\u000d\u000a      taken and the database searched for the matching algorithm (based around\u000d\u000a      cross-correlation). In\u000d\u000a      summary, this makes the observed signature as robust as possible for use\u000d\u000a      in real-world\u000d\u000a      environments. Further patents (e.g. [4, 5]) describe improvements such as\u000d\u000a      breaking the signature\u000d\u000a      into small blocks that are allowed to move freely to account for stretch\u000d\u000a      in the object or errors in the\u000d\u000a      time-base of the recording instrument, as well as specific embodiments in\u000d\u000a      which the laser head is\u000d\u000a      integrated into, for example, a printer.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers:\u000d\u000a      Prof Cowburn, Chair in Nanotechnology, Imperial College London, 2005-2010\u000d\u000a      Dr P Seem, PhD student, Imperial College London, 2005-2009\u000d\u000a      Dr JDR Buchanan, Senior Application Engineer, Imperial College London,\u000d\u000a      2005-2010\u000d\u000a      Dr S Buehlmann, Senior Application Engineer, Imperial College London,\u000d\u000a      2008-2010\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42253","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There have been several important development stages undertaken by the\u000a      Imperial College group, all with strong industrial interaction and product\u000a      feed through, that has led to the commercial and academic success of the\u000a      all-fibre integrated supercontinuum source. Before our seminal publication\u000a      in 2004 there were no commercial supercontinuum sources with visible\u000a      radiation capability, although our infra-red system of 1997, which was\u000a      commercialized by IPF Technology, did have the capability but required\u000a      external frequency doubling and this was not available as a commercial\u000a      add-on.\u000a    The high power supercontinuum source has had significant impact on\u000a      various fields from time resolved spectroscopy, imaging and remote sensing\u000a      and most certainly has been a commercial success. The major beneficiaries\u000a      have been manufacturers of the fibre based product: high power,\u000a      supercontinuum fiber lasers are now sold by commercial laser companies\u000a      such as Fianium (UK), NKT Photonics (Denmark) and Toptica (Germany and\u000a      USA). Devices have been available from 2006, but visible spectral coverage\u000a      was limited. Our research publications showing how short wavelength\u000a      spectral extent of the supercontinuum was linked to long wavelength loss,\u000a      e.g. [6], and our demonstrations illustrating mitigation of this effect\u000a      and allowing short wavelength extension to the blue have led to commercial\u000a      devices operating throughout the complete visible spectrum with high\u000a      spectral power density. Impact has been made on the commercial devices\u000a      which are now truly \"white light\", in fact covering practically the\u000a      complete window of transmission of optical fibre. Minimizing the IR loss\u000a      allowed manufacturers to introduce simpler fibre structures and improve\u000a      the performance and specification of commercial products.\u000a    The best example of a commercial Yb fibre MOPFA-powered, fully integrated\u000a      supercontinuum source incorporating photonic crystal fibre is exemplified\u000a      by the Fianium product line [A]. The Whitelase supercontinuum sources\u000a      provide \"a spectrum from below 390nm to beyond 2400nm, enabling\u000a        applications such as fluorescence imaging, broadband spectroscopy,\u000a        optical coherence tomography (OCT), and time-correlated single-photon\u000a        counting\" [B]. In a letter Fianium states the important contribution\u000a      of J.R. Taylor's group, and in particular publication [4], to the \"development\u000a        of commercial supercontinuum fiber lasers\". It confirms that \"the\u000a        current installed base of supercontinuum fiber lasers is approximately\u000a        1000 units worldwide and this follows directly from pioneering research\u000a        conducted by Professor J.R. Taylor's group. With our current devices\u000a        being priced at between &#163;12,000 and &#163;80,000, this number of sales\u000a        represents a significant impact on the commercial development of the\u000a        market\" [C]. In 2012 Fianium, which has headquarters in Southampton\u000a      and offices in the US, Europe and Asia, won the Queen's Award for\u000a      Enterprise in the Innovation Award category for the development of the\u000a      Whitelase Supercontinuum Fibre laser [D].\u000a    The Danish company NKT Photonics offers a range of commercial\u000a      supercontinuum lasers under the SuperK brand. Their SuperK Extreme\u000a      supercontinuum lasers \"represent the next generation of supercontinuum\u000a        lasers that are truly turn key with industry leading brightness covering\u000a        the entire 400-2400nm wavelength range\" [E] and \"with more than\u000a        8W of total power and 2W of visible power, the SuperK EXTREME lasers are\u000a        the brightest supercontinuum lasers on the market\" [F]. The SuperK\u000a      Extreme laser \"covers a broad range of applications such as\u000a        Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM), Optical Coherence Tomography\u000a        (OCT), Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC), F&#246;rster Resonance\u000a        Energy Transfer (FRET), Flow cytometry, DNA sequencing, White Light\u000a        Inteferometry (WLI), Test and Measurement and many others\" [E]. In a\u000a      letter NKT Photonics confirms the key role the Imperial group played in\u000a      the research and development of fiber based supercontinuum sources, in\u000a      particular paper [4]. It also confirms the effect of this on the products\u000a      it offers: \"this basic configuration of the all-fibre integrated\u000a        scheme, pumped by a MOPA...provided as inspiration for commercial high\u000a        power supercontinuum sources, several types and models which [the]\u000a        company produces\" [G]. Users of the SuperK product include Leica\u000a      Microsystems, Germany, the RECENDT Research Centre for Non Destructive\u000a      Testing GmbH, Austria, and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany\u000a      [H].\u000a    Important to the further simplification and power scaling was the\u000a      realization by us that continuous wave fibre lasers could be employed for\u000a      supercontinuum generation as opposed to the general consensus that\u000a      efficient nonlinear optics required high peak powers. This was achieved\u000a      through a complete understanding of the non-linear processes controlling\u000a      supercontinuum generation, in particular modulational instability that\u000a      initiates it and the process of soliton-dispersive wave interaction that\u000a      mediates long and short wavelength extension. The potential for\u000a      commercialization was acknowledged through the award of a Royal Society\u000a      Brian Mercer Feasibility Award in 2008 [I]. Through this we have looked at\u000a      the complete simplification of the supercontinuum source, minimizing the\u000a      number of components in order to produce a very commercially competitive\u000a      device. IPG Photonics have \"indicated [their] willingness to support\u000a        the commercialization of this in collaboration with Prof Taylor's group\"\u000a      [J]. The Feasibility Award has now ended and the potential\u000a      commercialization of the technology is on-going.\u000a    Following the commercial success of high power supercontinuum sources,\u000a      J.R. Taylor from the Imperial College group, in collaboration with\u000a      Professor J.M. Dudley at the University of Franche-Comte, was commissioned\u000a      to prepare a commercially successful research text \"Supercontinuum\u000a      Generation in Optical Fibers\", Cambridge University Press, ISBN\u000a      978-0-521-51480-4 (2010). In the first year since publication this text\u000a      book has sold 460 copies.\u000a    Additionally, during the period of this impact assessment, our pioneering\u000a      work in developing the systems and clarifying the underlying science and\u000a      technological challenges has been recognized in the field through 21\u000a      invited talks (solely on high power supercontinuum generation) at the\u000a      major international conferences incorporating Industrial Trade Shows where\u000a      commercial supercontinuum sources were exhibited. For example at\u000a      Biophotonics '11 (Sweden), International Conference on Laser Optics 2010\u000a      (Russia), The Latin American Optics &amp; Photonics Conference (Brazil),\u000a      International Conference on Materials &amp; Advanced Technologies\u000a      (Singapore), Asia Optical Fiber Communications &amp; Optoelectronics\u000a      Exposition and Conference (China). Fianium confirm that the \"many\u000a        international conference presentations delivered by Professor J.R.\u000a        Taylor and members of his group have helped stimulate significant\u000a        world-wide interest and demand for commercial supercontiuum products\"\u000a      [C].\u000a    The beneficiaries of our research span all fields as a direct result of\u000a      the diverse applications of the high power supercontinuum source. These\u000a      devices have been directly cascaded into research and imaging diagnostics,\u000a      with primary application in health care as well as in the biomedical\u000a      research base. According to Antonoly Grudinin, CEO of Fianium Ltd, \"Ultrafast\u000a        fiber lasers in general and super-continuum sources in particular have\u000a        good prospects to become a key technology in biomedical applications\"\u000a      [K].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The development of a high average power, all-fibre integrated,\u000a      supercontinuum (or \"white light\") source, has led to a completely new\u000a      product that has had significant commercial impact on the fibre laser and\u000a      applications market place.

Spectral broadening in\u000a      lasers or external to the laser cavity as a result of nonlinearity has\u000a      been identified and utilized since the late 1960s. However, no commercial\u000a      devices were developed simply because of the unwieldy experimental\u000a      configurations and the instability and irreproducibility as a result of\u000a      lens focussing into the nonlinear medium. With the appearance of low loss\u000a      optical fibre in the 1970s control of nonlinearity became simpler and more\u000a      reliable yet lens coupling from bulk lasers prohibited commercial\u000a      development of supercontinuum sources.\u000a    A major step in the miniaturization, power scaling and reliability of\u000a      fundamental pump sources came with the development of the all fibre master\u000a      oscillator power fibre amplifier scheme or MOPFA [1]. This was an\u000a      experimental technique that was pioneered and developed by the Imperial\u000a      College group in collaboration with IPG Photonics, the world's largest\u000a      manufacturer of fibre laser and amplifier based instrumentation, in the\u000a      mid-1990s. By 1997, the group in collaboration with IPG Photonics\u000a      developed an extremely compact moderate average power (1W) supercontinuum\u000a      source [2] that was commercialized by IPF Technology in the UK, a spin-off\u000a      company from IPG Photonics and led by ex-Imperial College Physics\u000a      Department personnel. This device was not a \"white light\" source, instead\u000a      utilizing soliton-Raman cascading, a technique developed by the Imperial\u000a      College group, to cover the near infra-red range from 1000nm to 2300 nm.\u000a    With the introduction of photonic crystal fibre at the end of the 1990s\u000a      and the demonstration of supercontinuum generation in that medium\u000a      utilizing a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser, interest was renewed in\u000a      supercontinuum generation and the potential of \"white light\" generation.\u000a      These latter systems were identical to the earlier schemes of the 70s and\u000a      80s in their experimental configurations, exhibiting instability and low\u000a      average power levels of only a few milliwatts with little chance of\u000a      spectral power increase.\u000a    The quantum jump in supercontinuum sources was undertaken by the Imperial\u000a      group in 2002 [3]. The post deadline report in 2004 at the prestigious\u000a      international Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (paper CPDC7,\u000a      Conference on Lasers and Electro Optics, CLEO 2004) described the fully\u000a      integrated all fibre supercontinuum source incorporating a picosecond Yb\u000a      MOPFA with photonic crystal fibre as the non-linear platform [e.g. 2] drew\u000a      academic and commercial interest alike. The spectral power density was\u000a      three orders of magnitude greater than could be achieved with Ti:Sapphire\u000a      lasers and the construction was compact, reliable, reproducible and\u000a      completely hands free. In 2003 details of the construction were passed to\u000a      Fianium in the UK, a manufacturer of pulsed fibre lasers.\u000a    During the period of the current REF consideration, we have further\u000a      developed the source power-scaling by more than another order of magnitude\u000a      [3, 4] and solved the problem of extension of the supercontinuum to\u000a      blue\/UV spectral region [5, 6]. We identified that limitations to short\u000a      wavelength extension were caused by long wavelength loss and confirmed\u000a      that control of soliton-dispersive wave interactions were vital for short\u000a      wavelength extension [4]. This is implemented either through tapering of\u000a      the nonlinear PCF fibre or by controlling and lowering the loss in the\u000a      manufacture process or it can also be solved by simple power-length\u000a      scaling.\u000a    The Imperial personnel contributing to this research programme were\u000a      Academic Staff Members Prof JR Taylor and Dr SV Popov, RA Dr S.V.\u000a      Chernikov and PG Research Students Mr. J.C.

With the lasers fundamentally based upon\u000a      developments in\u000a      telecommunications and through the use of telecommunications specified\u000a      components, this has led\u000a      to greater reliability and simplification, such that the basic commercial\u000a      laser product requires no\u000a      maintenance and is characterised by a simple user interface that requires\u000a      no laser optimization\u000a      procedures. As a consequence, the systems are in demand in the\u000a      applications market place and\u000a      this is best exemplified by the medical laser market, where the\u000a      reliability, compactness, no need for\u000a      servicing and cost reduction of fibre based laser medical systems has had\u000a      instant impact.\u000a    Over the period 2006-2010, high power Thulium fibre lasers operating at\u000a      1940nm were developed\u000a      in collaboration with IPG Photonics for applications in surgery. The water\u000a      peak absorption of tissue\u000a      at 1940nm allows for faster ablation and tissue removal compared to\u000a      procedures developed for the\u000a      Holmium laser at 2100nm. A 120W laser system was developed utilizing\u000a      single transverse mode\u000a      pumping from a Yb:Er laser system - the Thulium Fiber Laser System [B].\u000a      Collaborative clinical\u000a      trials were instigated at the Chelyabinsk Medical Centre, Russia and at\u000a      StarMedTech in Germany.\u000a      StarMedTech, an international medical technology company specialising in\u000a      surgical laser system\u000a      technology, also includes a 120W 1.9&#181;m Thulium laser in its product line &#8212;\u000a      the vela&#174; XL laser [C].\u000a      This laser is advertised for use in \"urology, gynecology, ENT,\u000a        pneumology, neurology and surgery\"\u000a      [C]. As with the IPG Photonics 1940nm lasers, due \"to its high\u000a        absorption in water, the optimized\u000a        wavelength of 1.9&#181;m is ideal for haemostatic cutting of soft and hard\u000a        tissue\" [C].\u000a    Dr Popov and the Femtosecond Optics Group at Imperial College have\u000a      collaborated closely with\u000a      the Medical Laser Division of IPG in the development, trials and\u000a      commercialization of several fibre\u000a      laser platforms for various medical procedures, some of which are now\u000a      routinely applied.

The ability to cover\u000a      the complete window of\u000a      transmission of silica based fibre from about 330nm to 2300nm has enabled\u000a      applications as\u000a      diverse as remote sensing and medical imaging. High average power\u000a      supercontinuum operation is\u000a      possible with up to 100mW\/nm spectral power density achievable [e.g. 1],\u000a      albeit using an industrial\u000a      scaled pump laser. Most typical commercial supercontinuum units deliver\u000a      maximum spectral power\u000a      densities in the region of 10mW\/nm and at Imperial College we have\u000a      developed such modestly\u000a      powered continuously pumped systems for medical imaging applications, such\u000a      as optical\u000a      coherence tomography (e.g. Bizheva et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 10,\u000a      1073, 2006). For many\u000a      real world applications spectral diversity coupled with high average power\u000a      operation in specific\u000a      spectral windows is an essential requirement and spectral selection or\u000a      filtering from a\u000a      supercontinuum provides inadequate average power levels. The realization\u000a      of more applicable\u000a      fibre based sources is the subject of this impact case study.\u000a    A key contributing component to the spectrally diverse, high power fibre\u000a      laser sources described\u000a      here was the introduction of the concept of the master oscillator power\u000a      fibre amplifier (MOPFA) that\u000a      was developed by the Imperial College group in collaboration with IPG\u000a      Photonics [2]. The\u000a      advantage of the MOPFA technique is that it utilizes an integrated low\u000a      power seed and this seed\u000a      can be in any format continuous wave (cw), nanosecond or picosecond. It\u000a      can be a laser diode or\u000a      fibre laser that is sequentially amplified in fibre to average saturation\u000a      powers well in excess of 1kW.\u000a      Single frequency operation is possible through manipulation of the\u000a      amplifier geometry, while\u000a      nonlinear effects such as spectral broadening can be negated through use\u000a      of large mode area\u000a      amplifying fibre.\u000a    Our initial MOPFA based studies primarily related to Yb and Yb:Er rare\u000a      earth doped schemes,\u000a      operating with tuneable bandwidths of about 40nm in the spectral region\u000a      around 1060nm and\u000a      1550nm respectively. We originally investigated spectral diversity through\u000a      the use of single pass\u000a      second harmonic generation (SHG) in periodically poled lithium niobate\u000a      (PPLN) in 1998 [3],\u000a      however, with average powers of several watts in the green,\u000a      photo-darkening in the PPLN was a\u000a      severe limiting problem. Photo-darkening with high power operation at\u000a      530nm was overcome in\u000a      2004 by the Imperial College group through the use of MgO doped\u000a      stoichiometric periodically poled\u000a      lithium tantalite [4]. Since then, and under the auspices of a Royal\u000a      Society Industrial Fellowship\u000a      carried out in association with IPG Photonics, Dr S. Popov of the Imperial\u000a      College group has\u000a      collaborated with the industrial partner in further developing high\u000a      average power green sources\u000a      based upon doubling in novel cavities incorporating poled crystals pumped\u000a      by cw Yb MOPFA\u000a      schemes.\u000a    In the visible, wavelength versatility was also demonstrated by the\u000a      Imperial group in the first\u000a      reported frequency doubling of a bismuth silica fibre laser giving up to\u000a      6.5W average power in the\u000a      yellow at 589nm (a wavelength of interest for artificial guide star\u000a      generation and also of relevance\u000a      for acne and vein treatments) single pass in PPLN [5]. Wavelength\u000a      diversity was also achieved at\u000a      the watt level by a second cascaded second harmonic generation of both the\u000a      Yb and Yb:Er laser\u000a      systems, allowing operation in the blue and ultra violet. Sum frequency\u000a      wavelength mixing of the\u000a      Yb and Er systems also permitted somewhat limited wavelength tunability\u000a      around 635nm, again at\u000a      watts average power levels.\u000a    The greatest wavelength diversity was achieved through development of the\u000a      fibre Raman MOPFA\u000a      undertaken at Imperial College in collaboration with personnel from IPG\u000a      Photonics. The use of\u000a      novel short length, high power cascaded fibre Raman laser structures\u000a      allowed complete\u000a      wavelength coverage from 1000nm to 2000nm. Our research programme,\u000a      undertaken to minimize\u000a      the effects of in-fibre nonlinearity, allowed high power operation with\u000a      narrow linewidths and\u000a      polarization preserving geometries. This allowed highly efficient second\u000a      harmonic generation of the\u000a      tunable Raman lasers from 500nm to 1000nm and with operational powers in\u000a      the harmonic\u000a      signals in excess of 3W [6], consequently permitting spectral coverage\u000a      matching the\u000a      supercontinuum source but with average power levels nearly three orders of\u000a      magnitude higher.\u000a    The personnel contributing to this research programme at Imperial College\u000a      London were Dr S V\u000a      Popov, Prof J R Taylor, and PG Research Students Mr. A.B. Rulkov, Mr. B.\u000a      Cumberland and Mr\u000a      S.A. Guskov. Dr Rulkov (PhD 2008) is employed by IPG Lasers GmbH.

QuantaSol's aim was to exploit QW technology in\u000d\u000a      multi-junction concentrator cells. The company was funded by Imperial\u000d\u000a      Innovations and the Low Carbon Accelerator. It was located in\u000d\u000a      Kingston-upon-Thames and employed between 12-16 people. In May 2009 it was\u000d\u000a      announced that QuantaSol had received &#163;1.35m of investment from a\u000d\u000a      syndicate of investors including the Low Carbon Accelerator, Imperial\u000d\u000a      Innovations, Numis Securities Ltd and Netscientific Ltd [A]. The first\u000d\u000a      performance impact of the new company came in June 2009. For six months\u000d\u000a      the company broke and held a 21-year-old world record for a single\u000d\u000a      junction concentrator cell with 28.3% efficiency at 534 times\u000d\u000a      concentration, verified by the Fraunhofer ISE [B, C]. This \"new\u000d\u000a        generation of 'nano-structured' millimetre-sized solar cells...could\u000d\u000a        convert the sun's energy to electricity more than twice as efficiently\u000d\u000a        as current technology, [and] can be tuned to the prevailing light\u000d\u000a        conditions of a particular place, to get the most out of the cells\u000d\u000a        wherever they are\" [C]. Commenting on the world record Kevin Arthur,\u000d\u000a      QuantaSol's CEO, said \"Our technology is the industry's best kept\u000d\u000a        secret. This is the first time that anyone has successfully combined\u000d\u000a        high efficiency with ease of manufacture, historically a bug-bear of the\u000d\u000a        solar cell industry\" [C]. The potential commercial and environmental\u000d\u000a      impact of QuantaSol was recognised by the award of the Guardian CleanTech\u000d\u000a      Top 100 company status in both 2008 and 2009 [D, E].\u000d\u000a    In late 2010 QuantaSol first manufactured triple junction cells with\u000d\u000a      strain-balanced QWSCs in the middle sub-cell. A median efficiency of 39.7%\u000d\u000a      was achieved for 171 cells on a production wafer [F], comparable with the\u000d\u000a      performance of cells from the market leader Spectrolab [G]. It was clear\u000d\u000a      that the strain-balanced QWSC was responsible for this enhanced\u000d\u000a      performance as a control wafer without the quantum wells had a median\u000d\u000a      efficiency of only 36.3% [F].\u000d\u000a    In 2011 the QuantaSol triple-junction cells passed technical\u000d\u000a      qualification with Amonix, the leading US concentrator manufacturer, who\u000d\u000a      qualified them for \"commercial deployment\" [H] in their high\u000d\u000a      concentration systems. The only other concentrator cell manufacturer to\u000d\u000a      achieve this status by 2011 was Spectrolab. As a result QuantaSol received\u000d\u000a      a substantial order from Amonix of 1MW of concentrator cells (approx.\u000d\u000a      50,000 cells) [H]. Amonix report that \"the QuantaSol design was better\u000d\u000a        matched to Amonix specifications than any other cell design we have\u000d\u000a        evaluated to date\" [H].\u000d\u000a    A further significant performance impact of the QuantaSol cells was\u000d\u000a      reported by Amonix in December 2011 [I]. They field tested cells from six\u000d\u000a      suppliers including QuantaSol. The depth of the quantum wells in the\u000d\u000a      QuantaSol cells had been optimised for the Amonix target solar spectrum.\u000d\u000a      Fig. 12 in their paper [I] presents the ratio of currents in top and\u000d\u000a      middle cell for field tests in six locations in the south-west of the US.\u000d\u000a      These ratios were closer to unity in the QuantaSol case (vendor 3) than in\u000d\u000a      the case of the other five vendors. The unity ratio corresponds to the\u000d\u000a      highest efficiency performance, confirming the advantage of the QWSC to\u000d\u000a      optimise for maximum energy harvest in different locations.\u000d\u000a    QuantaSol was sold to JDSU, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer, in\u000d\u000a      July 2011. The 2012 Annual Report from JDSU reported \"the acquisition\u000d\u000a        of critical product design, patented intellectual property and other\u000d\u000a        assets from QuantaSol, for a cash purchase price consideration of\u000d\u000a        approximately $3.7 million\" [J]. Alan Lowe, President of JDSU's CCOP\u000d\u000a      unit, said of the purchase: \"Incorporating key QuantaSol technology\u000d\u000a        will allow us to further differentiate our products and expand our\u000d\u000a        position in the CPV solar market as popularity for CPV continues to grow\"\u000d\u000a      [K]. All IP generated by Imperial and QuantaSol research passed to the\u000d\u000a      ownership of JDSU. The most important of these for the 40% triple junction\u000d\u000a      cell was licensed by Imperial Innovations exclusively to QuantaSol [P1].\u000d\u000a      Under the terms of the sale this patent will now be licensed to JDSU with\u000d\u000a      Imperial Innovations to accrue royalties from it.\u000d\u000a    The next performance milestone of the strain-balanced QWSC came at the 4th\u000d\u000a      International Concentrator Photovoltaic (CPV) Workshop in China in\u000d\u000a      September 2012. Jan-Gustav Werthen of JDSU announced that the company\u000d\u000a      manufacture cells on larger than standard wafers with median efficiency\u000d\u000a      41.5% [L]. These cells have significantly higher efficiency performance\u000d\u000a      than Spectrolab cells, the market leader in CPV and a Boeing subsidiary.\u000d\u000a      The data sheet on the Spectrolab web-site claim that their CPV cells on\u000d\u000a      standard sized wafers have a \"typical efficiency\" of 40% [G].\u000d\u000a    A significant commercial impact of the strain-balanced QWSC is revealed\u000d\u000a      by the current JDSU data sheet [M]. This shows results from 1160 cells\u000d\u000a      nearly all of which had cell efficiency above 40%. The spread in\u000d\u000a      efficiency is remarkably small considering that this was the first report\u000d\u000a      of quantum well cells grown on wafers with more than double the area of\u000d\u000a      the standard wafer. The uniform performance is important as many cells are\u000d\u000a      connected in series in concentrator systems. The larger wafer size will\u000d\u000a      also impact by reducing cell costs.\u000d\u000a    As reported in Section 3, research by the QPV group in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Sheffield in the period 2007 - 2011 underpinned another advantage for\u000d\u000a      QuantaSol [Patent US 20110180129 A1]. Quantum wells in the quaternary\u000d\u000a      material GaInAsP lattice matched to the GaInP of the top cell were\u000d\u000a      developed. This QW system turned out to have unexpectedly high radiative\u000d\u000a      efficiencies. The performance impact of this further Imperial research was\u000d\u000a      demonstrated in a JDSU presentation in 2013 where they announced a further\u000d\u000a      1% absolute efficiency increase in production cells by incorporating\u000d\u000a      quaternary QWs in the top sub-cell [N]. The wafer average of 42.5% makes\u000d\u000a      JDSU the manufacturer of the world's highest efficiency production cells.\u000d\u000a      At the same meeting Solar Junction, who hold the record for research cell\u000d\u000a      efficiency, reported a median efficiency of 41.9% for their production\u000d\u000a      cells [O]. Additionally QWs in both the top and middle cell make it\u000d\u000a      possible to independently optimise both top and middle cell absorption\u000d\u000a      edges, which cannot be done with conventional cells. Hence it will be\u000d\u000a      possible to maximise energy harvest as spectral conditions and cell\u000d\u000a      temperature vary during the day and over the year. This will extend the\u000d\u000a      range of beneficiaries of CPV technology outside the southwest US,\u000d\u000a      potentially world-wide and also enable novel low carbon applications of\u000d\u000a      CPV such as in building integration and powering electric cars [F].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The quantum well solar cell (QWSC) was invented, developed and patented\u000d\u000a      by the Quantum Photovoltaics (QPV) research group at Imperial. QuantaSol\u000d\u000a      was spun out of Imperial college in 2007 and was awarded Guardian\u000d\u000a      CleanTech Top 100 awards in 2008 and 2009. In May 2009 it received &#163;1.35m\u000d\u000a      of funding from a syndicate of investors. In 2011 QuantaSol was bought by\u000d\u000a      JDSU, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer, for US $3.7million. The\u000d\u000a      quantum well (QW) technology developed by the QPV group enabled QuantaSol,\u000d\u000a      and subsequently JDSU, to manufacture QWSCs with efficiencies above those\u000d\u000a      of the then market leaders, Spectrolab and Solar Junction. Uniquely, QWs\u000d\u000a      will allow JDSU to optimise cells for maximum energy harvest in different\u000d\u000a      solar spectra. This will increase world-wide the beneficiaries of\u000d\u000a      concentrator technology and enable other low-carbon applications in\u000d\u000a      building integration and electric transport.

Phys, 67, 3490). Quantum wells (QWs) enhance efficiency by\u000d\u000a      making it possible to optimise the wavelength at which the cells absorb\u000d\u000a      sunlight. The basic idea was patented [US patent No. 5,496,415] and a\u000d\u000a      number of versions of the cell were developed in over 2 decades of\u000d\u000a      research supported by EPSRC [e.g. G1, G2], the EU and the Greenpeace\u000d\u000a      Trust.\u000d\u000a    In 1991 the Quantum Photovoltaic (QPV) group at Imperial first\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that incorporating QWs into a cell enhances the efficiency\u000d\u000a      compared to a control cell without wells (1991, Appl. Phys. Lett., 59,\u000d\u000a      135). From 1990 to 2009 the underpinning device physics of QW solar cells\u000d\u000a      was researched and a simulation programme SOL developed to model QWSC\u000d\u000a      performance [1]. This work was reviewed in an invited chapter in a\u000d\u000a      definitive textbook on the uses of nanotechnology in photovoltaics\u000d\u000a      (Nanotechnology for Photovoltaics, ed. Loucas Tsakalakos, CRC Press,\u000d\u000a      2010).\u000d\u000a    A key research insight for the commercialisation of this technology came\u000d\u000a      in 1999 when the strain-balanced QWSC was invented at Imperial and grown\u000d\u000a      successfully by collaborators at the EPSRC National Centre for III-V\u000d\u000a      Technology at the University of Sheffield [2]. This version of the cell is\u000d\u000a      protected by a U.S. patent which is exclusively licensed by Imperial\u000d\u000a      Innovations to JDSU [P1]. The significance of this research is that the\u000d\u000a      band-gap energy of GaAs is higher than optimal. Competitors lower the\u000d\u000a      band-gap by growing an alloy InGaAs which has a bigger atomic separation\u000d\u000a      than GaAs. This introduces dislocations which reduce device performance.\u000d\u000a      The strain-balanced QWSC approach introduces the InGaAs alloy as few nm\u000d\u000a      wide QWs separated by wider barriers formed from the alloy GaAsP which has\u000d\u000a      a narrower atomic spacing. The approach which balances the stress at the\u000d\u000a      well-barrier interfaces was worked out at Imperial and formed the basis of\u000d\u000a      the patent [3, P1].\u000d\u000a    The complete absence of dislocations in a strain-balanced QWSC means that\u000d\u000a      the recombination of carriers is reduced. The unavoidable radiative\u000d\u000a      recombination back into photons dominates. In a QW cell even this loss can\u000d\u000a      be overcome by reflecting these photons back into the cell. The QPV group\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the advantages of photon-recycling in a solar cell for the\u000d\u000a      first time [4].\u000d\u000a    A second key research insight for the commercialisation and the breadth\u000d\u000a      of potential beneficiaries was the discovery of a second radiatively\u000d\u000a      efficient QW system suitable for the GaInP top sub-cell of the\u000d\u000a      triple-junction. Experiments at Imperial showed that QWs made from a\u000d\u000a      quaternary alloy GaInAsP in GaInP barriers had much better quality than\u000d\u000a      other options. This was an unexpected research insight as the quaternary\u000d\u000a      alloy has very poor crystal quality in bulk quantities. However, the QPV\u000d\u000a      group demonstrated that nm wide QWs on this alloy had high radiative\u000d\u000a      efficiency. On the basis of the experimental results from Imperial, John\u000d\u000a      Roberts the crystal grower at Sheffield applied for a patent (US\u000d\u000a      20110180129 A1).\u000d\u000a    The breadth of the beneficiaries of this research has been greatly\u000d\u000a      extended by this new QW system. QWs in the top and middle sub-cells make\u000d\u000a      it possible to optimise the wavelengths at which both the top and middle\u000d\u000a      cells absorb sunlight. Hence dual-QW cells have the unique advantage of\u000d\u000a      being able to tune the cell for different spectra to be found in different\u000d\u000a      locations and in other low-carbon applications. Another unique advantage\u000d\u000a      of the top sub-cell wells is that the radiative recombination coupled from\u000d\u000a      the top to middle sub-cells cell will reduce sensitivity of the\u000d\u000a      multi-junction cell to spectral and temperature variation, greatly\u000d\u000a      extending the breadth of beneficiaries of this technology [5].\u000d\u000a    Key researchers at Imperial: Keith Barnham (Senior Lecturer,\u000d\u000a      Reader, Professor, Emeritus Professor), Ian Ballard (RA 2000 - 2007),\u000d\u000a      James Connolly (RA 2000 - 2004, 2006 - 2008), Ned Ekins-Daukes (RA 1999 -\u000d\u000a      2003, Lecturer 2008 to date), Massimo Mazzer (CNR Fellow, Visiting\u000d\u000a      Professor, 2002 - 2008), Carsten Rohr (RA 2001 - 2006)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42256","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Heat capacity is an important quantity to establish for the development\u000a      of new materials in areas as diverse as energy storage, energy generation,\u000a      optoelectronic communications or magnetism. New materials studied in\u000a      single crystalline form are often available in only very small quantities\u000a      and therefore the creation of an instrument that provides the ability to\u000a      measure small samples, in particular magnetic samples, sensitively has\u000a      particular importance for this reason.\u000a    The direct derivative of the swept field ac calorimetric probe developed\u000a      at Imperial College is currently being sold at Cryogenic Ltd. Cryogenic\u000a      Ltd is a leading supplier of high field superconducting magnets and low\u000a      temperature measurement systems which operate without liquid helium.\u000a      Cryogenic Ltd has offices in the UK, USA and Australia, and is partnered\u000a      with distribution companies in thirteen other countries [A]. The system\u000a      was designed, tested and optimised within the Solid State Physics Labs at\u000a      Imperial College in 2003-4 and was published as a scientific instrument\u000a      design in 2005 [1]. That was the primary method by which the research was\u000a      disseminated. The technical know-how was transferred to Cryogenic Ltd in\u000a      2005, by direct discussions with the company (discussions that were\u000a      facilitated by Imperial Innovations in the first instance and later by\u000a      Cryogenic's employment of Dr. Bugoslavsky).\u000a    Throughout the following years the Imperial College research on\u000a      magnetocalorics has gained worldwide interest and through presentation at\u000a      international meetings and journal publication we have continued to\u000a      disseminate the use of the microcalorimeter. In this sense the research\u000a      undertaken at Imperial College has helped to underpin the commercial\u000a      impact of the probe that is being sold by Cryogenic Ltd.\u000a    Since 2006, Cryogenic have been selling developments of the Imperial\u000a      designed microcalorimeter as part of its Measurement Systems range\u000a      (Cryogenic product range webpage [B]). The system allows for specific heat\u000a      measurements to be made for samples with microgram weights using a\u000a      miniature calorimeter fabricated on a silicon nitride membrane with\u000a      thermometer and heater. This technique offers unsurpassed sensitivity\u000a      combined with simplicity of operation [C]. The normal temperature range is\u000a      2 to 300K, and high magnetic fields can be applied. The Cryogenic Specific\u000a      Heat measurement system features: low amplitude of temperature\u000a      oscillations and hence high temperature resolution (typically 0.1K); fast\u000a      measurements as the frequency of the temperature modulation is of the\u000a      order of 10 to 100 Hertz; high sensitivity of 1 nJ\/K throughout the\u000a      temperature range 2-300K [B, D]. The system is robust and durable; with\u000a      reasonable care the lifetime of a single sensor can span over tens of\u000a      sample replacements [B, C]. The method used by the microcalorimeter is \"fast\u000a        and capable of resolving details that would be very difficult if not\u000a        impossible to see using other methods such as relaxation calorimetry\"\u000a      [E].\u000a    The Cryogenic Ltd microcalorimetry heat capacity probe provides a useful\u000a      alternative method to the relaxation method offered by other\u000a      manufacturers, making it possible to measure small samples that are\u000a      invisible to other commercial probes. An additional advantage is the\u000a      possibility to make rapid measurements at varying temperature or applied\u000a      magnetic field. The small size of the measurement cell makes it easy to\u000a      adapt the experiment to the user's requirements (e.g. mounting on a\u000a      rotating stage, in small applied AC magnetic field, or illuminating with\u000a      light).\u000a    The contribution and importance of the ac microcalorimeter to Cryogenic\u000a      Ltd has been confirmed in a letter from the Managing Director of Cryogenic\u000a      Ltd [F]. He confirms that the company offers a heat capacity option that\u000a      was \"developed at Cryogenic based on a prototype originally devised at\u000a        Imperial College...published in Review of Scientific Instruments in 2005\"\u000a      [F]. The company \"understood the competitive advantage of this method\u000a        and commercialised it, making it compatible with cryogen-free and\u000a        liquid-helium based magnetic systems\" [F].\u000a    Cryogenic trades internationally and many of its customers \"are based\u000a        in countries where liquid helium is of limited availability\" [F]. In\u000a      countries such as \"Brazil, India, the Middle East, China and...Japan\"\u000a      [F] liquid helium is very hard or extremely expensive to obtain making\u000a      cryogen free equipment attractive.\u000a    The probe is ideally suited to the characterisation and therefore the\u000a      development of magnetic materials. Magnetic materials play a dominant role\u000a      in many key areas of technology (renewable energy, transport, sensors,\u000a      information storage). The highly sensitive probe also has potential for\u000a      use in a wide range of applications, where only small samples are\u000a      available, including biochemical and biomedical diagnostics, for which\u000a      samples are functionalised with magnetic beads or undergo changes of state\u000a      in magnetic field. End users primarily reside in research laboratories.\u000a    Cryogenic Ltd report that in the last 3 years sales of the heat capacity\u000a      option, which is priced at about &#163;[text removed for publication] [C, F],\u000a      amount to approximately &#163;500K. The specific heat option is sold as \"a\u000a        valued component in about 20% (&#163;2M worth) of the larger integrated\u000a        measurement systems [which are worth &#163;12M]...95% of [the]\u000a        Company's products are exported overseas and 75% goes outside Europe\"\u000a      [F]. They further note that adding \"measurement options for heat\u000a        capacity and thermal conductivity has greatly benefited the market\u000a        acceptance of [their] instruments\" [F].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Heat capacity is the measurable physical quantity that specifies the\u000a      amount of heat required to change the temperature of an object or body by\u000a      a given amount and is an important quantity to establish in any\u000a      application that requires knowledge of the thermal response of a material.\u000a      It is quite usual in the development of new materials that the volume of\u000a      material available in single crystalline form is limited, and the ability\u000a      to measure small samples sensitively has particular importance for this\u000a      reason. We claim a dominant influence on the design of an ultrasensitive\u000a      heat capacity microcalorimeter that is now sold by the UK company\u000a      Cryogenic Ltd as a heat capacity option for their cryogenic measurement\u000a      systems. The microcalorimeter makes it possible to measure ultra-small\u000a      samples, particularly magnetic samples that are invisible to other\u000a      commercial probes.

The\u000a      particular emphasis of our research relates to the development of\u000a      materials for room temperature magnetic refrigeration using the\u000a      magnetocaloric effect (the change of temperature of a material in the\u000a      presence of a magnetic field). Development of unique instrumentation has\u000a      always been at the forefront of the group's strengths. The group had begun\u000a      to study magnetocaloric materials in 2003, and needed to measure the\u000a      specific heat capacity of small samples as a function of magnetic field.\u000a      Instrumentation to carry out these types of measurements was not available\u000a      commercially.\u000a    Prof Minakov (employed on a Royal Society International Collaboration\u000a      grant with the group for several months in 2003 [G1]) and Dr Yuri\u000a      Bugoslavsky (post-doctoral researcher supported by the EPSRC [G2]) built\u000a      on Minakov's prior experience using a commercially available Si nitride\u000a      membrane to perform scanning calorimetry over very large temperature\u000a      excursions. Minakov had already studied the device's response to small\u000a      temperature oscillations but not to magnetic field.\u000a    The development of the microcalorimeter as a working instrument to\u000a      determine heat capacity as a function of swept magnetic field took place\u000a      at Imperial College [1]. It required thorough analysis of heat transfer\u000a      through the device to the sample and to its surroundings, establishment of\u000a      protocols for reliable measurement, and experimental verification of their\u000a      accuracy. The work performed at Imperial College is published in reference\u000a      [1] and can be summarised as:\u000a    A) Heat transfer analysis\u000a    B) Establishment of protocols for use of the probe\u000a    C) Development of the analysis for magnetic field dependence of\u000a      calorimetry\u000a    Imperial Innovations was consulted about intellectual property rights\u000a      protection in 2005 but the research was deemed unsuitable because the\u000a      silicon nitride membrane was a commercially available device (from Xensor\u000a      Integration) and Minakov had published aspects of its use for ac\u000a      calorimetry prior to the development work at Imperial College (and hence\u000a      making patent protection ineligible). Nonetheless, the inventors were keen\u000a      to see the technique translated into a commercial product and from 2005\u000a      worked with Cryogenic Ltd to pursue this.\u000a    Key Researchers:\u000a    \u000a      Prof A.

The offices and laboratories are based in the London Bioscience\u000a      Innovation Centre\u000a      (LBIC) [A]. The average annual turnover of deltaDOT Ltd from 2008-2012 was\u000a      &#163;640.2k per annum,\u000a      with turnover sales consisting of \"sales of instruments and from\u000a        service fees, contract research and\u000a        analytical work\", with much of these sales representing exports [B].\u000a    The HPCE analytical instruments are designed, manufactured and marketed\u000a      by deltaDOT Ltd.\u000a      These instruments use deltaDOT's proprietary imaging and analysis\u000a      technology &#8212; LFII. HPCE and\u000a      LFII applied to a Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) analytical system offers\u000a      dramatically improved\u000a      discovery power in comparison to other conventional CE systems. HPCE is\u000a      applied in Life\u000a      Sciences research, drug testing, diagnostics and bio-pharmaceutical\u000a      manufacturing. The\u000a      technology is used in detection, separation and analysis of proteins,\u000a      nucleic acids, carbohydrates,\u000a      viruses and bacteria, chemicals and a wide range of other analytes [A]. In\u000a      2012 deltaDOT Ltd\u000a      signed an agreement with the major distributor HORIBA UK for sales in the\u000a      UK and Eire [L].\u000a      HORIBA UK currently offers the HPCE-512 from deltaDOT Ltd [C].\u000a    deltaDOT has raised over $12M equity (e.g. [D]) over the last 15 years.\u000a      It has been profitable since\u000a      2010, after a Buy-in Management Buy-Out led by Hassard and Nigel Stokes,\u000a      an Imperial alumnus.\u000a      The latest Annual Accounts submitted to Companies House for the year up to\u000a      31\/12\/2012 reported\u000a      'cash at bank' of &#163;257,601, 'net worth' of &#163;569,595 and 'assets' worth\u000a      &#163;808,027 [E]. All of the\u000a      revenues generated by deltaDOT Ltd are based on Imperial HEP research [B].\u000a    In addition to the specific cases outlined below, sales of LFII\u000a      instruments by deltaDOT Ltd have\u000a      been to various sectors and include (i) five global pharmaceutical\u000a      companies, (ii) a global analytical\u000a      company, (iii) a US diagnostic company, and (iv) UK and US universities\u000a      [B].\u000a    2009 saw the formation of the affiliate company, deltaDOT QSTP-LLC,\u000a      in Qatar. The company\u000a      was launched as a joint venture between the Qatar Science and Technology\u000a      Park (QSTP) and\u000a      deltaDOT Ltd [F]. The company developed a 500-square-meter world class\u000a      proteomics research\u000a      and testing facility in Doha which was the Arab emirate's first such\u000a      facility [G]. QSTP invested $15\u000a      million in the project. $5 million of that was an equity investment in\u000a      deltaDOT Ltd, which provided\u000a      staff, expert support and an exclusive regional licence to its technology.\u000a      The remaining $10M set\u000a      up the proteomics facility at QSTP [B, C, F]. Discussing the investment,\u000a      Dr Eulian Roberts,\u000a      Managing Director of QSTP, said: \"We hope that this new venture will\u000a        result in ground breaking\u000a        findings in the field of Proteomics which will then find applications\u000a        locally and internationally. The\u000a        establishment of deltaDOT QSTP-LLC also falls in line with the Qatar\u000a        National Vision 2030 which\u000a        is for Qatar to be an active centre in the fields of scientific research\u000a        and intellectual activity\" [F].\u000a    Since its formation deltaDOT QSTP-LLC has generated revenues of $1.7M,\u000a      $3.5M, $3.7M and\u000a      $1.8M per annum for the years 2009-2012 respectively. John Hassard has\u000a      been the CEO of\u000a      deltaDOT QSTP-LLC during that time. In July 2012 deltaDOT Ltd sold its 20%\u000a      stake in deltaDOT\u000a      QSTP-LLC for circa &#163;550,000 [B]. As is the case with deltaDOT Ltd, all the\u000a      IP used by deltaDOT\u000a      QSTP-LLC is based on the research from the HEP group at Imperial College\u000a      [B]. A two-way IP\u000a      pipeline agreement exists between deltaDOT Ltd and deltaDOT QSTP-LLC [B].\u000a    Since 2008, examples of the use of the LFII system produced by deltaDOT\u000a      include:\u000a    Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)\u000a      deltaDot Ltd's LFII, in the form of the Peregrine HPCE system, was adopted\u000a      by the DARPA-funded\u000a      Accelerated Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals (AMP) programme, and by the\u000a      Defense Threat\u000a      Reduction Agency's rapid vaccine programme [H, I]. The Peregrine was\u000a      adopted as a competing\u000a      analytical tool for one of the several Rapid Vaccine development\u000a      programmes under the aegis of\u000a      the AMP programme, working with a consortium which included Dow Chemicals\u000a      and Xcellerex.\u000a      Only \"deltaDOTs analytical technology went through to the next stage\"\u000a      [J]. The rapid vaccine\u000a      programme was established by the US Department of Health and Human\u000a      Services (HHS) to\u000a      enhance the nation's emergency preparedness against emerging infectious\u000a      diseases and\u000a      \"deltaDOT's technology was adopted as one of the few non-US\u000a        contributors to the program\" [J].\u000a      The LFII approach was praised for its \"adaptability across a range of\u000a        targets\" and for \"allowing\u000a        rapid analysis of contaminants, protein post-translational\u000a        modifications, as well as allowing a highly\u000a        quantitate, unbiased, sensitive and reproducible analysis over a broad\u000a        dynamic range in both\u000a        molecular weight and concentration\". The AMP programme is \"required\u000a        to generate 50 million\u000a        vaccine doses within 120 days of identifying a threat's genome\" and\u000a      the \"Quality Control provided\u000a        by the LFII approach is uniquely suited to this demanding task\" [J].\u000a    In 2010, as part of this programme, \"Xcellerex, Inc. and Pfenex Inc.\u000a        announced...that the\u000a        companies, along with deltaDOT Ltd. and BioPharm Services have\u000a        successfully demonstrated the\u000a        production of purified swine flu H1 hemagglutinin (California strain) in\u000a        42 days starting from the\u000a        amino acid sequence of the protein\" [I]. During that period the\u000a      product quality was \"shown to be\u000a        fully within the specifications set out by the Defense Threat Reduction\u000a        Agency (DTRA) under its\u000a        Accelerated Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals contract\" with the\u000a      results of the programme\u000a      providing \"valuable tools for biodefense and pandemic response\" [I].

It has been used in (i) reduced and native antibody analysis\u000a      as part of their antibody-biobetter\u000a      project and to be used in future antibody-conjugate projects, (ii)\u000a      Nicotine analysis at\u000a      picomolar levels, (iii) analysis of pesticides down to very low levels,\u000a      (iv) batch-to-batch analysis of\u000a      products, for demonstrate consistency. As a result Caliber Biotherapeutics\u000a      is determined that\u000a      deltaDOT's technology is useful for providing \"in-process\" analytical\u000a        information that is useful for\u000a        bioprocessing\" and as a result will be purchasing further deltaDOT\u000a      Ltd instruments for QA\/QC use\u000a      in its manufacturing processes.

The underpinning research relates to the signal-to-noise\u000a      enhancing image processing\u000a      algorithms and the methodology associated with analysis of very large data\u000a      sets taken from each\u000a      molecule as it traverses each pixel at a specific time point. This allows\u000a      a space-time correlation\u000a      called vertexing to be achieved. Vertexing enables a vastly increased\u000a      signal to noise ratio to be\u000a      acquired allowing for molecular imaging that exceeds traditional\u000a      single-detector absorption imaging\u000a      techniques and for molecules that have significant UV absorption it allows\u000a      for a label free\u000a      methodology creating a superior performance over conventional capillary\u000a      electrophoresis.\u000a    The pattern recognition and track-finding tools, known as vertexing, were\u000a      developed by S\u000a      Margetides and J Hassard, working within the High Energy Physics (HEP)\u000a      group at Imperial, for\u000a      tracking and identifying high energy particles at CERN. The work was\u000a      written up as a conference\u000a      paper in 1993 [1].\u000a    The underpinning research that resulted in the LFII technology for\u000a      molecular detection has been\u000a      captured in a series of patents, originating from academics within the\u000a      Physics department\u000a      published from 1996 to 2004 [P1-P3]. LFII generates massive data files,\u000a      which need to be\u000a      processed, integrated, visualised and interpreted in real time. The\u000a      development of this type of\u000a      analysis was supported during the 2001-2005 period by the EPSRC grant\u000a      [G1].\u000a    Colling and Hassard generalised the vertexing methodology, calling the\u000a      technique the `Generalised\u000a      Separation Transform', (GST). The method is capable of finding and\u000a      separating objects in one or\u000a      more dimensions by correlating peaks in velocity space. It was patented in\u000a      1996, as a method of\u000a      identifying individual substances within a mixture of substances. The\u000a      mixture travels past a spaced\u000a      series of detectors, each being arranged to produce a signal\u000a      representative of a characteristic of\u000a      the mixture as it passes. Readings are taken repeatedly from each detector\u000a      which allows individual\u000a      substances to be identified within the mixture according to the peaks they\u000a      create in velocity space\u000a      [P1].\u000a    The method was developed further by J Hassard, S Hassard (both Imperial\u000a      staff) and A Mainwood\u000a      (Kings College) with specific application to biological molecules where\u000a      the molecules of interest are\u000a      good UV absorbers. This was patented in 2003 [P2].\u000a    D Sideris (HEP group member) refined the vertexing concept using\u000a      information typically available\u000a      at the analyte injection point (for example in a Capillary Electrophoresis\u000a      separation tool) and was\u000a      able to improve the signal-to-noise considerably. This was patented by\u000a      Sideris in 2004 (along with\u000a      William Sanders, John Hassard and Stuart Hassard) [P3]. In 2004 deltaDOT\u000a      built the world's first\u000a      label-free sequencer in 2004 and much intellectual property was generated\u000a      from this point forward\u000a      by the company at the incubator site at Imperial College.\u000a    Enhancement of the fundamental capability of label free multipoint UV\u000a      detection was demonstrated\u000a      for double stranded DNA molecules of different lengths using the LFII\u000a      technology in 2009 [2].\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a      From 1994-2000 all LFII work was academic in nature and took place solely\u000a      at Imperial by Imperial\u000a      staff. From 2000-2013, LFII work has been a mixture of commercial and\u000a      academic, and until 2009\u000a      was exclusively undertaken in the Imperial incubator and sites. Since\u000a      2009, the LFII work has\u000a      continued to be driven by Imperial personnel. In addition to the lead\u000a      researcher J Hassard, Imperial\u000a      researchers include S. Margetides, F. Pereira, and D. Colling (all of\u000a      HEP).\u000a    Key contextual information about this area of research.\u000a      HEP analysis required the isolation and identification of particles\u000a      through their 2D or 3D space and\u000a      3D or 4D space-time correlations. Three central driving issues in that\u000a      analysis method that were all\u000a      transferred over to the LFII platform were the painstaking attention to\u000a      the identification,\u000a      minimisation and removal of inherent biases, the very high throughput\u000a      necessary, and the very\u000a      small scales involved. All of these gave HEP technology a head start in\u000a      biotechnological and\u000a      microfluidic separations, where small really is beautiful.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42258","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The initial external impact of the research and patented micro-slab\u000d\u000a        laser technology [4] has been through the formation of a spin-out\u000d\u000a        company, Midaz Lasers Ltd [A, B]. Midaz was formed by Prof. Michael\u000d\u000a        Damzen and Dr Ara Minassian (Postdoctoral Research Assistant and former\u000d\u000a        PhD student) in 2006 as a vehicle to commercialise the technology. Until\u000d\u000a        its sale to Coherent Lasers Ltd in July 2012, Prof Damzen was on the\u000d\u000a        Company's Board of Directors and acted as Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u000d\u000a        and Dr Minassian acted as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO). The initial\u000d\u000a        funding from Imperial Innovations and the business angel, Dr Paul\u000d\u000a        Atherton, in 2006 was followed through with further funding from the\u000d\u000a        same investors in the period 2008 - 2012 [C, D]. The company has\u000d\u000a        employed three full-time and six part-time employees since January 2008.\u000d\u000a      The primary market and beneficiary for Midaz laser technology is in\u000d\u000a        the industrial laser manufacturing sector. Midaz high gain technology\u000d\u000a        allows increased speed and precision of manufacturing with a significant\u000d\u000a        cost reduction and decrease in laser size for improved integration of\u000d\u000a        the laser technology. The laser processing market is the single biggest\u000d\u000a        laser application in terms of US dollar sales, with laser sales\u000d\u000a        exceeding 2 billion US dollars annually (Source: Laser Focus World,\u000d\u000a          Annual Review of Laser Marketplace). The main customers targeted\u000d\u000a        by Midaz were systems-integrators and laser solutions providers\u000d\u000a        (including other laser companies). Laser processing has grown enormously\u000d\u000a        in recent years, particularly in micro-electronics (e.g. laser\u000d\u000a        processing of silicon) and consumer products (e.g.mobile phones,\u000d\u000a        cameras, LCD TV, touch panel displays), as well as in more traditional\u000d\u000a        sectors (e.g. automotive, aerospace) and new high growth sectors (e.g.\u000d\u000a        laser processing in solar cell production).\u000d\u000a      The first laser installation &#8212; and the first external revenue income\u000d\u000a        into Midaz &#8212; was to the UK Laser Manufacturing Centre (UK-LMC) in North\u000d\u000a        Wales as early as Aug 2006, after just a few months of company\u000d\u000a        operation. An early prototype laser was successfully installed and\u000d\u000a        trialled by UK-LMC leading to the first invoiced income to Midaz [E].\u000d\u000a        Midaz' main revenue since 2008 evolved from trialling prototype products\u000d\u000a        to customers in a number of industrial processing sectors (e.g.\u000d\u000a        industrial diamond cutting, silicon wafer cutting). Additional company\u000d\u000a        income (~&#8364;150,000) arose from contract work to the European Space Agency\u000d\u000a        to develop alexandrite lasers for light detection and ranging (LIDAR)\u000d\u000a        applications [F, G, H].\u000d\u000a      Since 2010, Midaz developed a few more fully engineered\u000d\u000a        (production-level) laser products incorporating the micro-slab\u000d\u000a        technology and the core patent [4] that derived from the Imperial\u000d\u000a        group's seminal research. This resulted in international sales of these\u000d\u000a        products, principally in Europe but also in N. America and Asia. In\u000d\u000a        particular, strong market traction of Midaz high gain amplifier products\u000d\u000a        occurred. Midaz amplifier products were both water-cooled (Product\u000d\u000a        Model: A70-W, [I]) and air-cooled (Product Model: A50-A, [J]). These\u000d\u000a        were attractive to other laser companies who could utilise the high gain\u000d\u000a        amplifier products to boost low power picosecond duration lasers to\u000d\u000a        powers relevant to the industrial market where power equates to\u000d\u000a        production speed. This simple step (low cost, low power seed plus Midaz\u000d\u000a        amplifier) offered massive potential cost savings over the current\u000d\u000a        expensive short pulse laser products.\u000d\u000a      This market traction led Midaz to interactions with the world-leading\u000d\u000a        laser company, Coherent Lasers Ltd, and resulted in the investors'\u000d\u000a        decision to seek exit by sale of the shareholding of the company. On 23\u000d\u000a        July 2012, Midaz was successfully acquired by Coherent Lasers for $3.8\u000d\u000a        million, with a significant return for investors [K]. Coherent, which is\u000d\u000a        headquartered in the USA, reported in their 2012 Annual Report and Form\u000d\u000a        10-K: \"In July 2012, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of\u000d\u000a          MiDAZ Lasers Limited for approximately $3.8 million in cash.

As\u000d\u000a        reported in a Coherent press release announcing the purchase of Midaz\u000d\u000a        (the company also acquired Innolight Innovative Laser and Systemtechnik\u000d\u000a        GmbH at the same time), `\"The acquisition of Innolight and MiDAZ\u000d\u000a          fits well into Coherent's mission of providing cutting edge solutions\u000d\u000a          to both industrial and scientific markets\" states Mark Sobey,\u000d\u000a          Executive Vice President at Coherent. \"We are excited not only with\u000d\u000a          the current Innolight product line, but also about the future ability\u000d\u000a          to extend the performance in many dimensions based on combinations\u000d\u000a          with MiDAZ and other Coherent technologies to address our customers\u000d\u000a          application roadmaps\"' [M].

The CEO of Coherent assessed that, although the addition of\u000d\u000a        Innolight would have only a small impact on the company's sales in the\u000d\u000a        short term, the combination with Midaz' technology would deliver \"tens of millions of dollars\" in sales by 2015 [N].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Midaz Lasers Ltd is a spin-out laser company formed by academic founders,\u000d\u000a      Professor Michael Damzen (Director and Chief Technology Officer, CTO) and\u000d\u000a      Dr Ara Minassian (Chief Scientific Officer, CSO), in 2006 as the vehicle\u000d\u000a      for commercial exploitation of patented laser technology [4] arising from\u000d\u000a      Prof Damzen's research group in the Physics Department at Imperial College\u000d\u000a      London.\u000d\u000a    Midaz has designed and assembled multiple engineered laser and amplifier\u000d\u000a      products, incorporating this patented technology, and has sold units to\u000d\u000a      industrial customers in Europe, N.

Prior to\u000a      our impact, most of these commercial magnetometers used fluxgate sensors\u000a      which are relatively large and heavy (e.g. http:\/\/www.bartington.com\/three-axis-fluxgate-magnetometers.html).\u000a      Some satellites have used magnetoresistive sensors, however these do not\u000a      have the performance of the SPAT instrument. Consequently, the design\u000a      fills a gap in the market for a small, lightweight (~200 grams), high-\u000a      performance yet relatively cheap satellite attitude magnetometer.\u000a    One such company, which had previously marketed a fluxgate instrument to\u000a      the commercial satellite sector, is the UK-based company SSBV Space &amp;\u000a      Ground Systems UK (formerly called Satellite Services Ltd). In 2010 the\u000a      company approached the SPAT group to engage in commercialisation activity\u000a      that to successfully transferring the electronics know-how and a license\u000a      for the sensor heads. In October 2010, Imperial Innovations granted\u000a      Satellite Services an exclusive 3-year license to market the design [A,\u000a      B]. The license terms required Satellite Services to make a one-off\u000a      payment to Innovations of $30k plus a royalty for each subsequent unit\u000a      sold [A, B]. The license allows Satellite Services to integrate Imperial's\u000a      electronics design into its own attitude and orbit determination system so\u000a      that it can be sold as an integrated package [C]. For instance, in cubesat\u000a      applications the magnetometer comes as part of the SSBV Attitude Control\u000a      System (ACS) board which can also host additional ACS sensors and\u000a      actuators. In microsat applications the additional electronics is\u000a      integrated with the sensor head resulting in a very compact unit that is\u000a      simple to accommodate. SSBV market the instrument as a low cost\u000a      magneto-resistive magnetometer designed for use in low earth orbit\u000a      smallsats and cubesats [C].\u000a    As at January 2013, Satellite Services has ordered 8 units from Imperial\u000a      Innovations, 7 of which have been sold to various clients including\u000a      academic groups in France, Spain and China, and also a commercial\u000a      satellite customer in Russia [B]. As reported by the company, customers \"are\u000a        using the units for controlling the attitude of their satellites in a\u000a        robust and low cost way enabling a new generation of missions to be\u000a        developed\" [B].\u000a    As corroborated by the CEO of Satellite Services Ltd [B], with a price\u000a      per unit of roughly &#8364;10,000 these units have contributed significantly to\u000a      the turnover of the company. In addition, the magnetometer technology has\u000a      allowed the size and cost of space-based magnetometers to be reduced\u000a      significantly, whilst simultaneously increasing their robustness to the\u000a      harsh space and launch environments [B]. This has therefore not only\u000a      impacted the end users economically, but more importantly also improved on\u000a      previous technologies available, assisting in improved and more successful\u000a      launches within the satellite sector. The magnetometer is also on sale\u000a      through CubeSatShop.com, a webshop that offers a broad range of\u000a      standardized, off-the-shelf components and subsystems for CubeSats and\u000a      nanosatellites [D]. CubeSatShop.com offers the Imperial designed\u000a      magnetometer for &#8364;11,000.\u000a    This new design will fly on the TechDemoSat mission [E], which is a\u000a      British technology- demonstrator satellite designed to give spaceflight\u000a      experience to new technologies developed in the UK. TechDemoSat is\u000a      scheduled to be launched in Kazakhstan in the first quarter of 2014. In\u000a      support of this activity, the TSB awarded Imperial a Knowledge Transfer\u000a      Partnership which funded an Imperial RA to spend 6-months working with\u000a      Satellite Services. At the end of this KTP, the RA entered full-time\u000a      employment with the company.\u000a    SSBV have approached Imperial Innovations regarding the potential renewal\u000a      of the license [B]. Imperial Innovations consider the benefits of the\u000a      magnetometer will extend to other markets and are currently undertaking a\u000a      business analysis in this regard [B].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Space &amp; Atmospheric Physics (SPAT) group's magnetometer\u000a      laboratory at Imperial has developed a small and lightweight magnetic\u000a      field instrument intended to be flown on future generations of extremely\u000a      small satellites or planetary landers. The instrument will be used for\u000a      planetary research or plasma physics in the space environment, and also\u000a      has application for attitude determination on satellites in Earth-orbit,\u000a      by comparison with the geomagnetic field (`digital compass').

This success is built on 4 decades of\u000a      involvement with agencies such as NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), CNSA\u000a      (Chinese National Space Agency), and others. The group is particularly\u000a      recognised for building magnetic field instruments which are embarked on\u000a      agency-provided missions. SPATs success stems from combining the building\u000a      of the instruments for space-flight with the scientific interpretation and\u000a      analysis of the data returned. Recent highlights of this program include\u000a      the ESA `Cluster' and `Ulysses' missions, the NASA `Cassini' mission and\u000a      the Chinese `Double Star' mission, all of which carried an Imperial-led\u000a      magnetometer as a scientific payload.\u000a    Underpinning this work is a vigorous programme of instrument development.\u000a      Whilst the instruments on Cluster, Cassini and Solar Orbiter use\u000a      `Fluxgate' type sensors, the SPAT group has recently developed an\u000a      instrument using `magnetoresistive' sensors [1]. Anisotropic\u000a      magnetoresistive sensors are low-cost commercially available devices\u000a      typically used in mobile phones, vehicles etc., for magnetic orientation\u000a      and position sensing. The novel adaptation (described by Brown et al. in\u000a      [1]) applies the group's fluxgate knowledge to improve the performance of\u000a      the magnetoresistive sensors. These developments are:\u000a    \u000a      Driven, first-harmonic detection utilising the sensor's built-in\u000a        `set\/reset' polarisation to effect automatic offset compensation\u000a      Closed-loop operation using magnetic feedback to improve linearity.\u000a    \u000a    When compared to a sensor operated without these developments, the new\u000a      design offers improved stability, linearity and accuracy.\u000a    The new instrument has recently been flown on the short-lived US\u000a      satellite CINEMA (CubeSat for Ions Neutrals Electrons and Magnetic Fields)\u000a      [2]. CINEMA was a CubeSat spacecraft designed to study Space Weather by\u000a      making measurements of the magnetic field and energetic ions and electrons\u000a      in near-Earth space.\u000a    The developments described by Brown et al. in the 2012 paper [1] have\u000a      recently been selected by the journal Measurement Science and Technology\u000a     as one of its highlights of 2011-2012, in the instrumentation category (http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-0233\/page\/Highlights%20of%202011-2012).\u000a     The papers were chosen by the editorial team and editorial board as having\u000a      been highly rated by referees and readers, downloaded and cited highly,\u000a      and being examples of high-quality, well-executed, outstanding research.\u000a    The research was performed entirely at Imperial College by Patrick Brown\u000a      (senior research officer, at Imperial 15\/08\/1997-present) and Trevor Beek\u000a      (electronics technician, at Imperial 12\/07\/1965-present) under the\u000a      direction of Chis Carr (Head of the magnetometer laboratory, 15\/10\/1990-present).\u000a\u0009  This work was funded by STFC as part of the SPAT group's rolling\u000a      grant [G1], which funded all of the group's scientific activities in space\u000a      plasma physics, as well as instrument development. The research occurred\u000a      during the period 2007 to 2012 which covers two `rolls' of the rolling\u000a      grant.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42260","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Company Development\u000d\u000a      As a direct result of research carried out in Physics at Imperial College\u000d\u000a      London, MV has been established as a robust (12 years and counting) UK\u000d\u000a      technology company, generating &#163;3.4M (&gt; &#163;1.2M equity, &gt; &#163;1.5M\u000d\u000a      contract and &gt; &#163;660K grant funding) in inward investment for\u000d\u000a      the UK over the 2008-2013 REF period [A-E]. A further &#163;2.6M of UK\u000d\u000a        equity investment has been injected into the economy via MV in this\u000d\u000a      period [A, B] and it has consequently been able to provide &gt; 50 person\u000d\u000a      years of employment for its own, primarily PhD-level, UK-trained staff. MV\u000d\u000a      has further supported a variety of skills enhancement activities,\u000d\u000a      including EPSRC KTS project costs for two PDRAs seconded from and a MV\u000d\u000a      Principal Scientist seconded to, the Physics Department, and MBA fees for\u000d\u000a      another MV Principal Scientist. This represents a direct economic impact\u000d\u000a      through investment funding for new activities, jobs created and protected,\u000d\u000a      turnover associated with new and improved services, and priority shifts in\u000d\u000a      expenditure and reallocation of budgets. Further details are given below.\u000d\u000a    In addition, MV has played a significant role in providing momentum for\u000d\u000a      the fledgling UK plastic electronics industry [F, G]. In particular, it\u000d\u000a      has focused attention on the opportunities for plastic electronics in the\u000d\u000a      medical diagnostics sector, which had not previously been recognised. MV's\u000d\u000a      BioLED&#8482; technology can also address multi-billion pound detection markets\u000d\u000a      for homeland security\/biodefence [E], environmental monitoring including\u000d\u000a      water quality, and animal health including bovine TB.\u000d\u000a    In 2008 MV had developed its first prototype devices, being the focus of\u000d\u000a      an article in The Engineer [C, H] and a September 2008 visit by\u000d\u000a      Phil Willis MP, then Chair of the House of Commons Innovation,\u000d\u000a      Universities and Skills (IUSS) Committee, as part of the Committee's\u000d\u000a      Engineering Inquiry [C, I]. In February 2009 Peter Woodford, a diagnostics\u000d\u000a      industry veteran of 35 years standing, including 15 years with Roche\u000d\u000a      Diagnostics, joined the company as Chairman, saying \"I am excited by\u000d\u000a        the clear potential of Molecular Vision's technology platform\" [J].\u000d\u000a      In September 2009 MV raised an additional &#163;2m in a round led by Imperial\u000d\u000a      Innovations to further the commercial development of the BioLED&#8482;\u000d\u000a      technology platform, with Innovations CEO Susan Searle commenting \"Point-of-care\u000a        diagnostics is becoming increasingly important in the provision of\u000d\u000a        patient care and through its innovative technology, Molecular Vision is\u000d\u000a        well placed to provide healthcare professionals with highly advanced\u000d\u000a        solutions\" [A]. A significant contract with L'Oreal was also\u000d\u000a      announced [D] and MV joined the European Defence Agency PathoID-Chip\u000d\u000a      project as a sub-contractor to Microfluidic ChipShop with a budget\u000d\u000a      reallocated from Nanoident [E]. MV further participated from January 2010\u000d\u000a      in the EU Photo-FET project (FP7-ICT 248052 Integrated Photonic\u000d\u000a        Field-Effect Technology for Bio-sensing Functional Components),\u000d\u000a      completed at the end of 2012 [K]. In 2010 MV additionally launched the\u000d\u000a      development of its CardioPlex&#8482; fluorescence based triple test for cardiac\u000d\u000a      markers myoglobin, CK-MB and Troponin-I. CardioPlex&#8482; was co-funded by\u000d\u000a      Acrongenomics and was successfully demonstrated in 2011. In February 2011\u000d\u000a      Dr Chris Hand, another diagnostics industry veteran with 20 years prior\u000d\u000a      experience, including founding, floating and selling Cozart plc, was\u000d\u000a      appointed MV CEO [C]. He, together with Abingdon Health Group colleagues,\u000d\u000a      subsequently raised funds to acquire a 50.1% stake in MV as part of a\u000d\u000a      wider &#163;3M deal that saw Imperial Innovations also invest in Abingdon\u000d\u000a      [A-C]. Most recently, agreements have been put in place with a leading\u000d\u000a      European pharmaceutical company and a large multi-national chemical\u000d\u000a      company to co-develop point-of-care diagnostic tests in the UK [B].\u000d\u000a    Healthcare Benefits\u000d\u000a      The novel microanalysis technology that MV has pioneered offers a step\u000d\u000a      change opportunity for point-of-care in-vitro diagnostics [B]. In\u000d\u000a      particular MV's BioLED&#8482; platform provides a simple-to-use, portable,\u000d\u000a      low-cost, rapid, quantitative diagnostic tool. It allows efficient,\u000d\u000a      accurate, multi-analyte measurement in a generic format that can utilize\u000d\u000a      absorption, turbidity, fluorescence, phosphorescence and chemiluminescence\u000d\u000a      detection schemes with existing assays on blood, saliva and urine samples\u000d\u000a      and at the cost of a few pounds, i.e. some 1000-fold cheaper than the\u000d\u000a      typical bench-top readers with which it competes in terms of sensitivity\u000d\u000a      and accuracy. It is anticipated that these tests will become a routine\u000d\u000a      tool in general practice. The availability of such devices would directly\u000d\u000a      address key objectives of health providers in the UK, Europe and the US,\u000d\u000a      notably: (i) reduced treatment time; (ii) improved quality of treatment;\u000d\u000a      (iii) reduced inequality of treatment by extending the facilities\u000d\u000a      available to remote surgeries; and (iv) improved ongoing care via\u000d\u000a      home-based preventative and post-treatment monitoring of at-risk patients\u000d\u000a      [L]. The cost-performance profile of the BioLED&#8482; platform is also well\u000d\u000a      suited to addressing the growing development of stratified medicine and\u000d\u000a      personalised health and beauty products. The disruptive nature of MV's\u000d\u000a      technology was recognized by the Abingdon Health Group, which acquired a\u000d\u000a      majority shareholding in MV in March 2012. Dr Hand, Abingdon founder and\u000d\u000a      CEO, states \"I believe that the Molecular Vision technology offers us\u000d\u000a        a current and future competitive advantage in the diagnostics sector. It\u000d\u000a        allows us to expand current markets, and with similarities to our\u000d\u000a        previous activities at Cozart, allows us to create new, currently\u000d\u000a        untapped markets for the benefits of the user, the patient and the\u000d\u000a        healthcare system\" [B].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Molecular Vision Ltd (MV), an Imperial Innovations spinout, has developed\u000d\u000a      a low-cost technology for multiplexed analysis on bodily fluids.

This innovation was informed by long-term\u000d\u000a      research undertaken by Bradley and John de Mello on organic light emitting\u000d\u000a      diodes (OLEDs) and photodiodes (OPDs) and by Andrew de Mello on\u000d\u000a      microfluidic chip structures. The resulting Imperial College intellectual\u000d\u000a      property (IP), focused on the combination of OLEDs and OPDs with\u000d\u000a      microfluidic structures, is protected by granted patents including\u000d\u000a      GB2369428, US 6,995,348 and EP 1336089, assigned to MV by Imperial\u000d\u000a      Innovations.\u000d\u000a    Initial research at Imperial College underpinning the BioLED&#8482; technology\u000d\u000a      was funded by EPSRC [G1] and by MV, supported by a BBSRC Small Business\u000d\u000a      Research Initiative grant [G2]. This involved both Imperial College and MV\u000d\u000a      staff and Imperial students using facilities in the College. It proved the\u000d\u000a      principle of the BioLED&#8482; platform and demonstrated the competitive\u000d\u000a      performance of OLED and OPD instrumented microfluidic structures. The\u000d\u000a      first application of polymer OLEDs as light sources for microchip based\u000d\u000a      fluorescence detection, the fabrication of dye-doped microfluidic\u000d\u000a      structures that integrate an efficient long-pass filter function, and the\u000d\u000a      use of polymer OPDs as detectors for microscale chemiluminescence resulted\u000d\u000a      from this work [1-3]. As also did the use of polymer OLEDs as integrated\u000d\u000a      excitation sources for detection of dyes separated by on-chip\u000d\u000a      electrophoresis and OPDs for chemiluminescent quantitation of hydrogen\u000d\u000a      peroxide (2 further journal papers, 133 ISI citations).\u000d\u000a    By mid-2006 MV had signed a development contract with Acrongenomics Inc\u000d\u000a      to work on kidney function, cardiac markers and sexually transmitted\u000d\u000a      diseases, with an initial focus on the detection of microalbuminuria (a\u000d\u000a      kidney disorder). It had also moved into the Imperial Bioincubator to\u000d\u000a      establish its own &gt; &#163;275K R&amp;D facilities to develop BioLED&#8482;\u000d\u000a      prototypes and test them on bodily fluids. Bradley and Andrew de Mello\u000d\u000a      were appointed Founder Directors and John de Mello Chief Scientific\u000d\u000a      Officer (CSO). Close research collaborations with Bradley and colleagues\u000d\u000a      have continued to the present day and resulted in a further 2 BioLED&#8482;\u000d\u000a      focused journal papers (30 ISI citations). These address the use of\u000d\u000a      polymer OPDs as detectors for microscale chemiluminescent antioxidant\u000d\u000a      capacity screening (2009) and an optimized system for fluorescence\u000d\u000a      immunoassays for cardiac markers myoglobin and CK-MB as an early\u000d\u000a      diagnostic of myocardial infarction (2011). MV also secured NHS Health\u000d\u000a      Technology Device funding for collaboration with Imperial, Acrongenomics\u000d\u000a      and Pearson Matthews &#8212; a design company specializing in the healthcare\u000d\u000a      sector &#8212; to develop prototype diagnostic devices. A PDA-based USB-powered\u000d\u000a      demo was shown in early 2007 and a battery powered version with a built-in\u000d\u000a      display followed late the same year. Eight conference papers also resulted\u000d\u000a      from the BioLED&#8482; focused research at Imperial between 2004 and 2008.\u000d\u000a    A second strand of research concerned materials development and\u000d\u000a      fabrication methods for OLED and OPD devices, respectively vapour-phase\u000d\u000a      polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (VPP-PEDOT) as an\u000d\u000a      ITO-replacement electrode and interlayer lithography and stamp transfer\u000d\u000a      printing methods [4-6]; funded by [G1] and [G3]. The resulting fabrication\u000d\u000a      IP was the subject of 2 patent filings: GB0523437.2 and GB0701909.4 that\u000d\u000a      were successfully licensed (July 2007) to MV for use in the medical\u000d\u000a      diagnostic sector. Electrode focused IP resulted in GB0713304.4. Together,\u000d\u000a      this research underpinned the development of flexible substrate devices\u000d\u000a      that enabled MV's participation in contract work for Microfluidic ChipShop\u000d\u000a      and sub-contracted work for Cambridge Display Technology (TSB OPALS\u000d\u000a      project). In 2007 a Royal Society Brian Mercer Award for Innovation to\u000d\u000a      Bradley and John de Mello, co-funded a project with MV and Imperial\u000d\u000a      Innovations to further develop the interlayer lithography and stamp\u000d\u000a      transfer printing processes and also supported development of the\u000d\u000a      VPP-PEDOT electrode system.

David Birch co-founded\u000d\u000a      IBH and the Photophysics Group in 1977\/8, served as IBH Chairman 1977-2003\u000d\u000a      and is presently Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH Director of Science and Technology.\u000d\u000a      His role, bridging between research, new products and the market, has been\u000d\u000a      crucial to achieving commercial success. The process to impact started by\u000d\u000a      demonstrating new instrument capabilities and applications through\u000d\u000a      publications, which developed the field, attracted the market to related\u000d\u000a      instrument products, and built the brand and reputation of IBH and Horiba.\u000d\u000a    Description of impact\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, Horiba and IBH together have won the largest market share of\u000d\u000a      fluorescence spectrometer sales. From this flows a sustainable business,\u000d\u000a      investment for innovation, and an extensive global customer base pursuing\u000d\u000a      diverse applications.\u000d\u000a    Improved products: The fluorescence spectrometer market is\u000d\u000a      comprised primarily of three parts. Fluorescence spectrometers,\u000d\u000a      incorporating steady-state (SS) sources, stand-alone fluorescence lifetime\u000d\u000a      spectrometers incorporating pulsed sources, and hybrid spectrometers that\u000d\u000a      combine both spectra and lifetime capabilities. Following the IBH-Horiba\u000d\u000a      merger, market impact was realized by upgrading Horiba's global SS\u000d\u000a      spectrometer user base with IBH's lifetime capability and the sale of new\u000d\u000a      instruments. [text removed for publication] Specifically, the present\u000d\u000a      IBH-Horiba lifetime-SS spectrometer range offers a more complete\u000d\u000a      measurement solution for non-specialist users than was hitherto available\u000d\u000a      from any supplier, as evidenced by the market leading position. The\u000d\u000a      seminal breakthrough was the transition from ~ 30 kHz pulsed spark lamp\u000d\u000a      sources to the more reliable and higher repetition rate semiconductor\u000d\u000a      sources (References 1 and 2). This launched a new range of spectrometers\u000d\u000a      based on the laser diodes and LEDs of the 1 MHz NanoLED and 100 MHz Delta\u000d\u000a      product ranges. These offered higher time resolution, stability, data\u000d\u000a      acquisition rate and ease of use, all at a reduced price (down to &lt;\u000d\u000a      $30k). This enabled expansion into key research markets in life-sciences,\u000d\u000a      medicine and bionanotechnology. In his definitive book \"Principles of\u000d\u000a      Fluorescence Spectroscopy\" 3rd ed., Springer 2006, JR Lakowicz wrote about\u000d\u000a      papers 1 and 2 \"Perhaps the most important development for TCSPC since\u000d\u000a        2000 is the introduction of pulsed-laser diodes and pulsed\u000d\u000a        light-emitting diodes......While this chapter was being written, the\u000d\u000a        first report appeared on excitation of intrinsic protein fluorescence\u000d\u000a        using a pulsed LED.\" This research was crucial to the instrument\u000d\u000a      developments that had such a significant market impact from 2008.\u000d\u000a    Market leading sales: The combined global market for fluorescence\u000d\u000a      SS and lifetime spectrometers exceeds &#163;100M.

The fluorescence spectrum and excited state lifetime (typically\u000d\u000a      nanosecond) are fingerprints of the emitting molecule and its local\u000d\u000a      environment. The properties of fluorescence, including quantum yield,\u000d\u000a      single molecule sensitivity, and polarization, and implementation in\u000d\u000a      tracking molecular kinetics, imaging and microscopy, have served to\u000d\u000a      establish fluorescence globally as a primary analytical technique.\u000d\u000a      Sequencing the human genome and immunoassay for disease diagnostics are\u000d\u000a      two well-known applications. Indeed, fluorescence has particular\u000d\u000a      importance in medical research and the life sciences, disciplines that\u000d\u000a      require routine operation of equipment by users who are not usually\u000d\u000a      instrumentation specialists. This case study is based on research that\u000d\u000a      improved performance in the main growth area of fluorescence spectroscopy,\u000d\u000a      namely excited state lifetime studies, which opened up new application\u000d\u000a      opportunities and led to considerable commercial success.\u000d\u000a    Key findings\u000d\u000a    Research published in the period 1996 - 2004 resulted in a number of\u000d\u000a      important discoveries and innovations as indicated below [numbers refer to\u000d\u000a      the references in section 3].\u000d\u000a    [1] An inexpensive, miniaturized and portable blue-green InGaN\u000d\u000a      light-emitting diode (LED) source and drive electronics for obtaining\u000d\u000a      pulses of ~ 1.9 ns at up to 10 MHz repetition rate. It was shown to be\u000d\u000a      ideal for faster acquisition of fluorescence decay data using the most\u000d\u000a      popular method of time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC).\u000d\u000a      Previously LEDs operated only at ~10 kHz.

The approach opened up new\u000d\u000a      markets involving molecules\/samples that changed rapidly e.g. silica\u000d\u000a      nanoparticle growth [5], and sensing e.g. glucose for diabetes [6].\u000d\u000a    [2].

Until\u000d\u000a      this work the alternatives were expensive mode-locked lasers or unreliable\u000d\u000a      and unstable spark lamps, which limited applications. The paper reported\u000d\u000a      excitation of the amino acid tyrosine at 280 nm. Subsequent joint\u000d\u000a      publications with IBH addressed the fluorescent amino acids tryptophan and\u000d\u000a      phenylalanine, and protein.

The\u000d\u000a      different selection rules for MPE can provide extra selectivity, but this\u000d\u000a      paper demonstrated an increased dynamic range of anisotropy decay, aiding\u000d\u000a      precision in particle metrology [5].

This was met by the\u000d\u000a      setting up of a spin-out company, Microlase Optical Systems Ltd, in 1992\u000d\u000a      by Professor Ferguson and two former graduate students. A single frequency\u000d\u000a      Ti:sapphire laser system, together with an external cavity frequency\u000d\u000a      doubler, formed the core of the Microlase business. Throughout the 1990s\u000d\u000a      Microlase was able to build on the technology being developed in the\u000d\u000a      Department of Physics and by the late 1990s the company had grown to about\u000d\u000a      20 people with annual sales of about &#163;3M principally through sales of the\u000d\u000a      single frequency Ti:sapphire and frequency doubler (MBR and MBD). Work\u000d\u000a      during this period included building the laser source for the first\u000d\u000a      all-solid-state multiphoton system to be developed (Source 1).\u000d\u000a    Microlase was sold to Coherent Inc in late 1999 becoming Coherent\u000d\u000a      Scotland Ltd but still under the management of the original founders of\u000d\u000a      Microlase. This opened many industrial markets and Coherent made\u000d\u000a      significant investment in plant and factory facilities. The Coherent\u000d\u000a      facility in Glasgow is one of the most advanced in the Coherent group of\u000d\u000a      companies. The original Microlase MBR and MBD products still contribute to\u000d\u000a      the Coherent Scotland Ltd product portfolio.\u000d\u000a    The laser system of choice for multiphoton imaging is now the mode-locked\u000d\u000a      Ti:sapphire laser. Further Strathclyde research on these lasers in the\u000d\u000a      late 1990s and 2000s (eg Ref 4-6) contributed to the development of\u000d\u000a      mulitphoton imaging as a tool for biological imaging, including the\u000d\u000a      exploration of suitable laser sources and imaging configurations. To\u000d\u000a      address this new market opportunity, Coherent Scotland Ltd, developed a\u000d\u000a      new product, the Chameleon mode-locked Ti-sapphire source, which was\u000d\u000a      launched in 2003. This laser system is an integral part of multiphoton\u000d\u000a      imaging systems now very widely used as an imaging tool in the leading\u000d\u000a      life sciences laboratories across the world.\u000d\u000a    In 2006, the original founders of Microlase left Coherent Scotland and\u000d\u000a      established a new laser company, M Squared Lasers Ltd, to develop laser\u000d\u000a      systems based on research at Strathclyde and elsewhere.

Further there is related impact generated via\u000d\u000a      the extensive cluster of laser development and manufacturing in the West\u000d\u000a      of Scotland, which is due at least in part to the underpinning research\u000d\u000a      carried out at the University of Strathclyde since 1993.\u000d\u000a    The performance of Coherent Scotland during the REF assessment period is\u000d\u000a      summarised below (Source 2):\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Year\u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          2008\u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          2009\u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          2010\u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          2011\u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          2012\u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000d\u000a    In terms of product portfolio, the original Microlase Ti:sapphire laser\u000d\u000a      (MBR) continues to be a commercial success and remains part of the\u000d\u000a      Coherent Scotland Ltd product portfolio. An updated and automated version\u000d\u000a      of the MBR laser has been developed by M Squared Lasers. It is estimated\u000d\u000a      that between these companies well over 1000 of these systems have been\u000d\u000a      sold, largely for research applications, both in universities and other\u000d\u000a      research laboratory settings, including for high resolution spectroscopy\u000d\u000a      and cold atom physics.\u000d\u000a    Coherent Scotland Ltd continues to expand its Glasgow operation. The\u000d\u000a      Glasgow facility is now Coherent Inc's centre for the development of its\u000d\u000a      highly successful ultra-short pulse laser systems based on the mode-locked\u000d\u000a      Ti:sapphire system and marketed as the Chameleon. Launched in 2003, the\u000d\u000a      landmark of 1000 systems shipped was passed in 2010 (source 4), and total\u000d\u000a      sales are now approaching 2000 systems. The use of multiphoton imaging as\u000d\u000a      a practical research tool by biological scientists and clinicians has been\u000d\u000a      transformed by the Chameleon laser. The Chameleon is now a workhorse for\u000d\u000a      multiphoton imaging applications in biology, optogenetics and\u000d\u000a      neuroscience, enabling clinical research into diseases of societal\u000d\u000a      importance such as Alzheimers.\u000d\u000a    More recent products developed by Coherent Scotland have enabled\u000d\u000a      step-change applications in semiconductor wafer inspection and in\u000d\u000a      materials processing. The Azure, a deep-UV (266nm) laser, is a compact,\u000d\u000a      low-noise, CW source specifically designed for easy integration into an\u000d\u000a      industrial environment. This short wavelength is essential for the\u000d\u000a      inspection of sub-20nm nodes in next generation semiconductor wafer\u000d\u000a      manufacture. Customers for this product are major capital equipment\u000d\u000a      manufacturers who in turn sell to major semiconductor chip manufacturers.\u000d\u000a      The Talisker is a family of industrial picosecond lasers for\u000d\u000a      micromachining applications. Customers for this product include\u000d\u000a      manufacturers of high brightness LEDs, solar panels, touch panel displays\u000d\u000a      for phones and tablets, and medical devices. These are largely mass market\u000d\u000a      products which offer improved operating efficiencies and performance (eg\u000d\u000a      more accurate touch screens) compared with predecessors as well as reduced\u000d\u000a      damage to the environment.\u000d\u000a    M-Squared Lasers is one of the fastest growing technology companies in\u000d\u000a      the UK serving a global marketplace (Source 5).

The combination of\u000d\u000a      Coherent, M Squared Lasers and Thales, together with the research\u000d\u000a      capabilities of the University's Institute of Photonics, were critical in\u000d\u000a      the decision of the Fraunhofer Society to choose to set up its first UK\u000d\u000a      research centre in Glasgow in the area of applied photonics\u000d\u000a      (Fraunhofer-CAP) in 2012. Of special note was Fraunhofer-CAP's involvement\u000d\u000a      with M Squared Lasers which resulted in a number of high value research\u000d\u000a      contracts in 2013, contributing to Fraunhofer-CAP's current &#163;1.6M contract\u000d\u000a      portfolio (Source 8).

The single\u000d\u000a      frequency Ti:sapphire laser has been the tool of choice for many\u000d\u000a      researchers working in the area because of its high power, excellent beam\u000d\u000a      quality and narrow line-width. However, for researchers undertaking\u000d\u000a      research in cold atoms in the mid-1990s, commercial laser sources with\u000d\u000a      suitable operating parameters for this research were not available. This\u000d\u000a      led researchers in the Department of Physics to undertake basic laser\u000d\u000a      research, including the novel development of the laser systems available\u000d\u000a      commercially at that time, as a means to developing their own laser tools\u000d\u000a      for cold atom work (Ref 1-3). This research was funded by a series of\u000d\u000a      grants from various sources such as Spectra-Physics (a laser company), the\u000d\u000a      National Physical Laboratory, EPSRC and the EU.\u000d\u000a    Multiphoton Imaging\u000d\u000a      The second area of underpinning research has been research into the use of\u000d\u000a      solid state mode-locked lasers for multiphoton imaging of living tissue,\u000d\u000a      and the development of suitable laser sources for this application. The\u000d\u000a      use of multiphoton imaging has been one of the most rapidly growing areas\u000d\u000a      of biomedical imaging.

The benefits are\u000a        now more wide ranging, as the instrumentation solutions sold by Cascade\u000a        Technologies are used in the monitoring of pollution (both marine and\u000a        automotive), detection of leaks in aerosol systems, and the detection of\u000a        minute traces of explosives. The sensors developed by Cascade\u000a        Technologies are used to ensure that the companies that have purchased\u000a        the instrumentation meet the strict emission guidelines set out by EU\u000a        and USA regulatory bodies.\u000a      Reach and Significance\u000a        Economic benefits in UK\u000a        Cascade Technologies was the first supplier of quantum cascade laser\u000a        based spectrometers capable of making trace gas measurements.

This\u000a        commitment to reducing the production of greenhouse gases was reaffirmed\u000a        at the 2012 Doha climate change talks. The drive to reduce greenhouse\u000a        gas emission means that there is an obvious need for instrumentation\u000a        that can detect and quantify rapidly the concentration of these gases in\u000a        the atmosphere, or from polluting sources such as industrial plants,\u000a        aeroplanes and ships. Laser based spectroscopy has been shown to be a\u000a        suitable basis for such instrumentation. Furthermore, laser based\u000a        spectroscopy has the necessary sensitivity to detect the trace levels of\u000a        gases emitted by the gaseous pre-cursor of improvised explosive devices\u000a        and so the instrumentation developed for pollution monitoring can also\u000a        be applied to homeland security.\u000a      Key Researchers\u000a        The underpinning research was undertaken from 1999 in the Department of\u000a        Physics at the University of Strathclyde by Dr Nigel Langford (employed\u000a        January 1990 as Lecturer, promoted April 1999 to Senior Lecturer,\u000a        promoted May 2005 to current post as Reader), Professor Geoff Duxbury\u000a        (employed January 1981, Professor from January 1987, Emeritus Professor\u000a        from October 2006) and Mr E Normand (PhD student at time of research).\u000a      Key Research Findings\u000a        History &#8212; In 1999 Dr N Langford and Prof G Duxbury were funded by\u000a        EPSRC to investigate the use of the newly developed mid infrared light\u000a        source, the pulsed quantum cascade (QC) laser, for the optical detection\u000a        of trace gases. Although the first demonstration of this class of laser\u000a        was in 1994, it was not until 1997 that a variant suitable for optical\u000a        spectroscopy, the distributed feedback (DFB) quantum cascade laser, was\u000a        available. A student, Mr E Normand, was employed on this grant. The key\u000a        outcome from this research was the development of a laser-based\u000a        spectrometer that combined the recently developed pulsed DFB QC laser\u000a        with well-established multi-mirror long path cells, thereby enabling the\u000a        rapid detection and quantification of trace gases.\u000a      Methodology &#8212; The approach developed by Duxbury, Normand and\u000a        Langford, intrapulse spectroscopy, was significantly different from the\u000a        methodology used by other researchers for the detection of traces gases.\u000a        In contrast to the other research groups that used short duration (&lt;\u000a        20 ns) optical pulses to detect trace gases, the Strathclyde approach\u000a        was to use long duration optical pulses (300 - 2000 ns). A consequence\u000a        of operating the QC laser in pulsed mode is that the frequency of the\u000a        laser's output radiation changes during the pulse giving a time varying\u000a        frequency or frequency chirp.\u000a      Advantages of Intrapulse Spectroscopy &#8212; The frequency chirp\u000a        associated with the intrapulse spectroscopy technique is of crucial\u000a        importance as it (i) eliminates optical interference effects in the\u000a        multiple mirror cell (these interference effects have been a major issue\u000a        in the use of multiple mirror cells for optical spectroscopy as they\u000a        limit the sensitivity of the spectrometer) and (ii) allows the\u000a        absorption spectrum of the trace gas to be written on to the time\u000a        profile of the pulse so giving a simple way of observing the spectrum.\u000a        Furthermore, the approach generates frequency windows that are large\u000a        enough (typically 100 GHz) to enable the observation of many absorption\u000a        lines of trace gases simultaneously, giving the user the ability to\u000a        determine the concentration of a single gas using several different\u000a        lines or to monitor the variation of gases during different processes,\u000a        such as changes in methane and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere or\u000a        acetylene in the growth of synthetic diamond.\u000a      The initial intrapulse spectrometer that was developed under the EPSRC\u000a        funding was further refined with funding from the NERC (P2 in Section\u000a        3). This research funded both ground level measurements and airborne\u000a        measurements through flights on the Airborne Research and Survey\u000a        Facility aeroplane and in these flights the effectiveness of the\u000a        instrumentation was demonstrated further. The key development discussed\u000a        in point (i) was patented in 2003 (see P1 in Section 3).

In addition the increased\u000a      bandwidth leads to\u000a      improved signal-to-noise performance. The Chief Scientific Advisor at\u000a      ThruVision (a division of\u000a      Digital Barriers plc.) writes of \"applications of the high power\u000a        capability of the Strathclyde sources\u000a        enabling stand-off, real-time detection, in all weather conditions [and]\u000a        over increased distances\u000a        (&gt;100m).\" (Source 3).

In February 2011, e2v\u000a      made a public\u000a      announcement of their factory manufactured gyro-TWA at the International\u000a      Vacuum Electronics\u000a      Conference (IVEC), Bangalore, India (Source 4).\u000a    The first prototype device was sold in 2012, with e2v technologies CTO\u000a      stating that\u000a    \"The fully funded development and prototyping programme resulted in\u000a        sales of [text removed for\u000a      publication] for e2v and e2v placed subcontracts on a range of\u000a        consortium members......e2v\u000a        continues to work actively with its consortium partners to develop the\u000a        technology and broaden\u000a        the range of applications\" (Source 1).\u000a    He goes on to state that the emphatic demonstration of performance\u000a      presents the UK-MOD with a\u000a      decision about implementation into operational systems, the commercial\u000a      impact of which he\u000a      estimates at [text removed for publication]. The Russian research\u000a      collaborators have since made\u000a      sources for material processing, through a company called Gycom Ltd. who\u000a      build and sell\u000a      gyrotrons for the ITER project as well as for industrial heating\u000a      applications. The impact of\u000a      Strathclyde's research continues to expand into new applications through\u000a      additional company\u000a      engagement. For non-defence sectors, a market survey by Talavera Science\u000a      identified a potential\u000a      market value of $260M for enhancement to nuclear magnetic resonance and\u000a      electron\u000a      paramagnetic resonance spectrometers and $5M for cloud profiling radar.\u000a      Competitor high power\u000a      amplifiers cost approx. &#163;200k per unit and the 50x improvement in\u000a      power-bandwidth product in\u000a      gyro-TWA devices commands a premium price. Impact that has already been\u000a      delivered in this area\u000a      includes the design effort and planning by magnet suppliers, such as\u000a      Cryogenics Ltd., to establish\u000a      magnets that can be used with gyro-TWA sources. At the same time companies\u000a      such as Thomas\u000a      Keating Ltd. have invested time to ensure the manufacturability of the\u000a      components required for the\u000a      gyro-TWA.\u000a    In the period 2008-2011, TMD Technologies Ltd supported research and\u000a      design work at\u000a      Strathclyde University to provide a Ka band gyro-TWA. They are now\u000a      developing the\u000a      manufacturing capability for this higher frequency gyro-TWA. This also\u000a      gave rise to a KTA project\u000a      with some &#163;170k from TMD to develop practical methods for high frequency\u000a      amplifiers. The\u000a      Technical Director of TMD writes of Strathclyde's contributions through\u000a      the \"many notable\u000a        breakthroughs and achievements in microwave source research\" and of\u000a      the strong relationship\u000a      with Strathclyde Physics to realise the impact of this technology (Source\u000a      5).\u000a    In the Healthcare \/ Biology sectors the applications are in enhanced NMR\u000a      spectroscopy, via\u000a      Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (DNP), and EPR spectroscopy. This has\u000a      influenced development\u000a      work in a number of companies. Since 2011, Thomas Keating Instruments have\u000a      been working on\u000a      the manufacture of a W-band gyro-TWA based on Strathclyde's research. Dr.\u000a      Wenlong He has led\u000a      work to upgrade the measurement equipment at Strathclyde to access the\u000a      higher frequency range.\u000a      The Strathclyde amplifiers allow the design of more advanced DNP transfer\u000a      schemes to greatly\u000a      improve performance of EPR and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance machines. The\u000a      use of a gyro-TWA\u000a      as a radio-frequency source for a medical linear accelerator has been\u000a      investigated by Elekta\u000a      Oncology Systems.\u000a    Environmental applications include the monitoring of space debris\u000a      (through funded work at\u000a      Chilbolton Laboratory), millimetre wave weather radar (work on comparisons\u000a      with airborne LIDAR\u000a      conducted by the MET Office) and the monitoring of volcanic ash clouds.\u000a      The increased bandwidth\u000a      of these sources leads to improved signal-to-noise performance and the\u000a      enhanced power\u000a      approximately doubles the usable range compared to conventional\u000a      instruments.\u000a    A significant number of jobs have been created as a result of this\u000a      research, estimated to be in\u000a      excess of 40 although precise numbers are not available due to the sector.\u000a      The companies\u000a      concerned, as well as dstl, have considerable and long-term development\u000a      programmes employing\u000a      a range of people developing new products and trialling prototypes. The\u000a      applications, product\u000a      development and trials have generated jobs at companies including e2v,\u000a      TMD, MBDA Ltd., NHS,\u000a      Selex Galileo Ltd. Culham Laboratories, Alcatel and Adtek, principally for\u000a      skilled graduates.\u000a      Devices have been made at e2v Chelmsford and TMD Hayes and trials are\u000a      on-going at e2v\u000a      Chelmsford. The dstl Principal Scientist has written that \"UK industry\u000a        has benefitted with people it\u000a        needs to exploit future economic opportunities.\" Amongst those\u000a      employed are at least 19 former\u000a      members of the ABP research group, now using skills learnt at Strathclyde.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Radiation sources and amplifiers, in the spectral region from microwave\u000a      to terahertz, are\u000a      extensively used in UK industry and public sectors such as security,\u000a      defence, health and the\u000a      environment.

Industrial\u000a      companies quickly appreciated the potential impact and became closely\u000a      involved from an early\u000a      stage. The driving motivation was to combine the power of a gyrotron with\u000a      the bandwidth of a\u000a      Travelling Wave Tube (TWT) amplifier, which had not been demonstrated\u000a      until the ABP group did\u000a      so in 2000. This is extremely important for applications since it allows\u000a      large amounts of energy to\u000a      be delivered in a small time window. The research included experimental\u000a      demonstrations of new\u000a      electron optics, sources and amplifiers in the microwave and mm-wave\u000a      regimes, complemented by\u000a      full theoretical analysis.\u000a    Key Findings: A key insight was that novel structures could couple\u000a      together two wave modes to\u000a      create new wave propagation behaviour, radically different from the\u000a      behaviour achieved using only\u000a      individual wave modes. Following the group's 1996 Physical Review Letter\u000a      (Ref. 1), a series of\u000a      calculations and numerical modelling studies underpinning proof of\u000a      principle laboratory research\u000a      experiments were undertaken in the period to 2000. Prototype designs for\u000a      new advanced masers\u000a      and amplifiers were designed and constructed, and the resulting knowledge\u000a      transferred to industry.\u000a      Helical waveguide structures were shown to provide unique wave propagation\u000a      characteristics, the\u000a      value of which was proven by operation of a gyrotron travelling wave\u000a      amplifier (gyro-TWA) at two\u000a      specific frequencies (9.1 and 9.4 GHz) in 1998 (Ref. 2). This was driven\u000a      by magnetrons donated by\u000a      e2v.\u000a    A 2000 Physical Review Letter (Ref. 3) extended the demonstration to high\u000a      power operation across\u000a      a wide frequency band by use of a conventional broadband TWT amplifier\u000a      (built by TMD) as the\u000a      input source. Joint EPSRC\/DSTL support enabled the helix concept to be\u000a      developed as a\u000a      frequency dispersive medium. Subsequently microwave pulse compression was\u000a      introduced, raising\u000a      the power by approximately x25 in shorter pulses, as reported in 2004\u000a      (Ref. 4). From 2005\u000a      research supported by QinetiQ Ltd on two-dimensional Bragg structures\u000a      demonstrated enhanced\u000a      single mode selection (Ref. 5). The company MBDA UK Ltd. continued to\u000a      develop the high voltage\u000a      power supply used in the QinetiQ programme and now uses it to run a novel\u000a      high power\u000a      microwave source UK test facility.\u000a    Subsequent research led to a cusp electron gun enabling higher power\u000a      gyro-TWA operation. This\u000a      work was sponsored by Elekta Oncology Systems through the PPARC Faraday\u000a      Partnership and\u000a      developed in collaboration with e2v and TMD. From 2010 an ultra-wideband\u000a      W-band (88GHz to\u000a      102GHz) oscillator was developed based on the cusp electron gun. This led\u000a      to a world record in\u000a      combined frequency bandwidth and power performance (Ref. 6), validating\u000a      this new technology for\u000a      Thomas Keating Ltd. for the biochemical spectroscopy market and for\u000a      ThruVision for surveillance\u000a      applications.\u000a    Key Researchers: This research by the Atoms, Beams and Plasmas\u000a      Group in the Department of\u000a      Physics was led by Adrian Cross, Kevin Ronald and Alan Phelps, with\u000a      contributions from Senior\u000a      Research Fellows Simon Cooke, Wenlong He, Colin Whyte and Alan Young.\u000a      Cross, Ronald and Phelps held academic appointments in the Department of\u000a      Physics at the time of\u000a      the research.\u000a    Adrian Cross: `Research only' contract from 1993 - 2000, Lecturer from\u000a      2001, Senior Lecturer from\u000a      2003, Reader since 2006.

Stimulated by CPPM's work on new nonlinear\u000d\u000a      fibre designs, researchers elsewhere (Bell Laboratories, 1999)\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that these fibres could be used to transform ultrashort laser\u000d\u000a      pulses into a broad range of wavelengths covering the visible and\u000d\u000a      near-infrared, known as a supercontinuum. Similar work was already\u000d\u000a      underway at the CPPM and the first Bath paper on the subject appeared just\u000d\u000a      weeks later [2].\u000d\u000a    These early supercontinuum sources were very much laboratory experiments\u000d\u000a      requiring expensive and complex ultrashort pulse Ti:sapphire lasers.\u000d\u000a      However, Wadsworth&#167; of the CPPM realised that far more\u000d\u000a      applications and far greater impact would be possible if the same results\u000d\u000a      could be obtained using the much simpler and cheaper technology of Nd or\u000d\u000a      Yb based lasers. This required the design of new fibres with dispersion\u000d\u000a      suited to the different laser wavelength, as well as an understanding of\u000d\u000a      how the physics of the generation would change from the ultrashort pulses\u000d\u000a      used originally, to longer (quasi-continuous) pulses [3].\u000d\u000a    In 2004, members of the CPPM (Wadsworth, Knight, Birks, Russell)\u000d\u000a      published a paper demonstrating supercontinuum with compact, long pulse,\u000d\u000a      Nd based lasers, which was also entirely compatible with the Yb based\u000d\u000a      fibre lasers being developed by Fianium at the time [4]. [text removed for publication] by\u000d\u000a      2005\/06 Fianium were selling supercontinuum sources. With the potential\u000d\u000a      for further commercialisation opportunities obvious to both parties,\u000d\u000a      Fianium and CPPM researchers embarked on an enthusiastic and fruitful\u000d\u000a      collaboration. By working closely with researchers in Bath's CPPM, Fianium\u000d\u000a      Ltd. has been able to understand, influence and licence developments in\u000d\u000a      supercontinuum laser technology to bring new products to market rapidly.\u000d\u000a    Further research on supercontinuum has followed in Bath, including\u000d\u000a      extending the visible wavelength coverage across the blue [5] and then the\u000d\u000a      ultraviolet (320nm) [6]. Complementary theoretical work by Skryabin&#167;\u000d\u000a      of the CPPM [7] has elucidated the physical processes controlling the\u000d\u000a      commercially important shortest wavelengths in the visible supercontinuum.\u000d\u000a      A key aim is to exploit the findings of this fundamental research to\u000d\u000a      develop routes to new technologies within the context of collaborative\u000d\u000a      research funded by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB)[8], Knowledge\u000d\u000a      Transfer Partnerships (KTP) and FP7.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43215","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Microwave Endometrial Ablation\u000d\u000a    In 1997, The University of Bath founded Microsulis Medical Ltd to\u000d\u000a      commercialise Professor Nigel\u000d\u000a      Cronin's invention of a device for microwave endometrial ablation (MEA).\u000d\u000a      Endometrial ablation is a\u000d\u000a      treatment for severe cases of menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) as an\u000d\u000a      alternative to\u000d\u000a      hysterectomy. Following clinical trials\u000d\u000a      [5], Microsulis' MEA device was\u000d\u000a      approved by the National Institute for\u000d\u000a      Clinical Excellence (NICE) [9], the U.S.\u000d\u000a      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u000d\u000a      [9] and gained the European kite mark.\u000d\u000a      The device underwent further\u000d\u000a      development over the past 15 years\u000d\u000a      and since 2008 has been widely used\u000d\u000a      to treat menorrhagia.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Microsulis MEA system, showing the microwave probe (right)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In summary the impact from the MEA system is:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      There are over 400 systems in hospitals worldwide and about 20,000\u000d\u000a        patients have been\u000d\u000a        treated during the REF period in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, South\u000d\u000a        Africa and New\u000d\u000a        Zealand [10].\u000d\u000a      The treatment is fast and safe and can treat all areas of the uterus\u000d\u000a        [9,11]. It removes the\u000d\u000a        danger of death (0.1%) [12] associated with hysterectomy.\u000d\u000a      A success rate of over 80% in dramatically reducing or stopping\u000d\u000a        menstrual bleeding\u000d\u000a        [9,11,13].\u000d\u000a      Treatment only takes three minutes and because it is minimally\u000d\u000a        invasive, patients usually\u000d\u000a        go home the same day [9]. This compares with the 3-6 days hospital stay\u000d\u000a        associated with a\u000d\u000a        typical hysterectomy, followed by recuperation time of anything up to\u000d\u000a        two months [11,12].\u000d\u000a      Accordingly there are huge savings in time for doctors and patients\u000d\u000a        alike. Additionally,\u000d\u000a        because the uterus remains intact, there are also major psychological\u000d\u000a        advantages for the\u000d\u000a        patient. This all translates into massive cost savings for health care\u000d\u000a        providers. [9]\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In February 2011, Microsulis sold the rights to its MEA device to\u000d\u000a      Novasure of Massachusetts for\u000d\u000a      $3M [14]. The sale provided funding for Microsulis to develop\u000d\u000a      ground-breaking devices for\u000d\u000a      microwave tissue ablation (MTA) and percutaneous microwave tissue ablation\u000d\u000a      (pMTA) based on\u000d\u000a      Cronin's research.\u000d\u000a    Microwave Tissue Ablation\u000d\u000a    The idea behind MTA is to use microwaves to produce a highly controlled,\u000d\u000a      localised and rapid\u000d\u000a      heating that destroys cancerous tumours. Initial development work\u000d\u000a      concentrated on liver tumours\u000d\u000a      [3-6]. Secondary liver tumours are common in cases of bowel cancer and, if\u000d\u000a      they are controlled,\u000d\u000a      there is a good chance of preventing further spread of the cancer. An MTA\u000d\u000a      device for use in open\u000d\u000a      surgery has been developed and following successful clinical trials [3,6]\u000d\u000a      obtained CE mark and\u000d\u000a      United States FDA approval [15]. Since its launch in 2008, over 100 MTA\u000d\u000a      systems have been\u000d\u000a      installed in hospitals around the world and nearly 700 treatments have\u000d\u000a      been completed, with high\u000d\u000a      success rates [10,16].\u000d\u000a    A needle-like (percutaneous) MTA device has also been developed and\u000d\u000a      gained European CE\u000d\u000a      mark, ETL safety accreditation and United States FDA approval [15] in\u000d\u000a      2010. The device has the\u000d\u000a      great advantage of being applied through the skin, rather than requiring\u000d\u000a      open surgery. This has a\u000d\u000a      number of advantages for patients, doctors and hospitals alike:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      It gives surgeons the option to treat previously inoperable\u000d\u000a        patients with tumours in\u000d\u000a        inaccessible locations [6,17].\u000d\u000a      A recent international review of clinical effectiveness [16] found\u000d\u000a        that of 250 ablated tumours\u000d\u000a        in 135 patients, local recurrence was observed at only 5% of\u000d\u000a        ablated sites\u000d\u000a      The treatment costs approximately &#163;2,500 per session and it\u000d\u000a        can be repeated. Surgery costs up to twice this amount and\u000d\u000a        there is less chance it can be repeated [18].\u000d\u000a      The procedure is less invasive than open surgery, meaning less\u000d\u000a        time in theatre, fewer medical complications and shorter\u000d\u000a        recuperation times [19].\u000d\u000a      Increased patient throughput and reduced operating and patient stay\u000d\u000a        costs and staff costs, leading to higher revenues in private healthcare\u000d\u000a        settings.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The Microsulis pTMA device\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Initial use of the pTMA device has been for liver tumours [16], but lung\u000d\u000a      [18], kidney, pancreas and\u000d\u000a      bone treatments are being performed [10]. Although only released in late\u000d\u000a      2010, pMTA is already in\u000d\u000a      use at over 80 surgical and radiological centres [10]. Over 5000 patients\u000d\u000a      have been treated with\u000d\u000a      MTA\/pTMA since 2008 and the number of new treatments is more than doubling\u000d\u000a      year on year [10].\u000d\u000a      Whilst there are many competing companies and devices in the oncology\u000d\u000a      arena, Microsulis are\u000d\u000a      well ahead of their competitors in terms of device performance and ease of\u000d\u000a      use. Commenting on\u000d\u000a      the Microsulis system, the consultant radiologist at Oxford University\u000d\u000a      Hospitals Trust states \"This is\u000d\u000a      a fantastic development.

They have recently invested &#163;250k in\u000d\u000a      a new in-house\u000d\u000a      production and packaging facility, increasing its manufacturing capacity.\u000d\u000a      Microsulis's sales revenue\u000d\u000a      in the REF period totals over &#163;11m [10]. The company was named `Innovator\u000d\u000a      of the Year' at The\u000d\u000a      News Business Excellence Awards in 2012 and also claimed the runner up\u000d\u000a      prize in the `Exporter of\u000d\u000a      the Year' category [14].\u000d\u000a    In February 2013, Microsulis was acquired by AngioDynamics of Albany (New\u000d\u000a      York) &#8212; a leading\u000d\u000a      international provider of medical devices. The sale for $15m [21] is\u000d\u000a      expected to provide new\u000d\u000a      impetus for global sales of the pMTA device (which is being marketed as\u000d\u000a      \"Acculis MTA\"), and\u000d\u000a      further improve patient access to this lifesaving technology.\u000d\u000a    In summary, Professor Cronin's invention of new technologies for medical\u000d\u000a      treatments has\u000d\u000a      revolutionised healthcare outcomes for tens of thousands of patients and\u000d\u000a      created substantial\u000d\u000a      economic impact both directly via the turnover of Microsulis Ltd and\u000d\u000a      indirectly via savings to\u000d\u000a      healthcare providers.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Microsulis Medical Ltd was founded in 1997 by the University of Bath to\u000d\u000a      commercialise Professor\u000d\u000a      Nigel Cronin's invention of a device for microwave endometrial ablation\u000d\u000a      (MEA) for use in treating\u000d\u000a      excessive menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).

There are two key aspects of the\u000d\u000a      methodology. The first is the\u000d\u000a      design of the microwave devices. The central challenge here is to deliver\u000d\u000a      the microwave power to\u000d\u000a      the tip of the probe, from where it radiates into the surrounding tissue,\u000d\u000a      without the probe itself\u000d\u000a      becoming hot. For example, with the percutaneous (through-the-skin)\u000d\u000a      microwave tissue ablation\u000d\u000a      (pMTA) device, 180 W of microwave power at 2.45 GHz is delivered to the\u000d\u000a      tip of a needle-like\u000d\u000a      probe with a diameter of 1.8 mm. This produces a highly controlled heating\u000d\u000a      over a large enough\u000d\u000a      volume to destroy a tumour. To keep the probe cool, water is circulated at\u000d\u000a      high speeds under 4 bar\u000d\u000a      of pressure. Cronin (Professor, Department of Physics, 1982-2011), and his\u000d\u000a      Medical Physics group\u000d\u000a      (including PhD students Clegg, Hardie, Feldberg) have been at the heart of\u000d\u000a      this development since\u000d\u000a      its initiation in 1994. They have designed, built and patented the\u000d\u000a      microwave probes [1].\u000d\u000a    The second aspect is to understand the effects of microwave irradiation\u000d\u000a      on various tissues, for\u000d\u000a      example, investigating how the heating effects depend on frequency and the\u000d\u000a      ways in which heat is\u000d\u000a      dissipated via blood flow, etc. Experimental [2,3] and modelling studies\u000d\u000a      [4] of these aspects led to\u000d\u000a      clinical trials [2,5,6]. Cronin and his group have also been heavily\u000d\u000a      involved in these experimental\u000d\u000a      and clinical studies. Without their work, the MEA, MTA and pMTA devices\u000d\u000a      developed and\u000d\u000a      marketed by Microsulis during the REF period would not exist.\u000d\u000a    The University of Bath has actively supported Microsulis over a period of\u000d\u000a      13 years, initially\u000d\u000a      providing the company with their own laboratory space on campus and by\u000d\u000a      granting Cronin\u000d\u000a      substantial periods of secondment to the company to further the\u000d\u000a      collaboration.

In 2011 alone this involved about one billion components,\u000a      400 million of which\u000a      were manufactured by Seagate Technology in Northern Ireland. The total\u000a      revenue from these\u000a      products is approximately $6 billion based on an output of 2.5 million\u000a      heads\/day each with a unit\u000a      value of circa $6. Following a series of mergers Seagate and Western\u000a      Digital now command over\u000a      90% of the world-wide hard drive industry with a turnover of $34 billion\u000a      per annum. . In a letter of\u000a      support from Dr Mahendra Pakela (former Director Western Digital Fremont)\u000a      to Professor O'Grady,\u000a      the commercial value of this impact is confirmed: \"I am happy to confirm\u000a      that your work, which is\u000a      now broadly accepted as the correct interpretation of exchange bias in\u000a      granular antiferromagnetic\u000a      layers, has enabled my company to design and develop improved layers which\u000a      we incorporate in\u000a      all the read heads we currently manufacture. This amounts to hundreds of\u000a      millions of components\u000a      each year.\" Using the work it was possible to design an antiferromagnetic\u000a      layer in terms of its\u000a      crystal orientation, grain size, size distribution and layer thickness,\u000a      tailored to the\u000a      equipment\/process used to achieve exchange bias. This in turn allowed for\u000a      the development of\u000a      layers with up to two times greater alignment and thermal stability. In\u000a      consequence thinner layers\u000a      could be used for increasing resolution.\u000a    The close relationship between O'Grady's group and the major magnetic\u000a      recording companies\u000a      ensured that the work was disseminated, not only via publications, but via\u000a      regular visits to the three\u000a      major hard drive manufacturers, i.e. Seagate, Western Digital and Hitachi\u000a      GST. Hitachi GST and\u000a      Western Digital are in the process of merging which means that all hard\u000a      drive manufacturers are\u000a      involved in utilising this work. Additionally Seagate Northern Ireland,\u000a      have sponsored students in\u000a      O'Grady's group continuously for the last six years and Seagate Media\u000a      Research in Fremont\u000a      sponsored students prior to that. Subsequently Western Digital provided\u000a      financial support for\u000a      contract measurements which supported post docs in York and Seagate\u000a      Technology, Northern\u000a      Ireland, are now doing the same. Further support for another PhD student\u000a      for 3 years has been\u000a      secured from Seagate from January 2012. A further contract with Seagate\u000a      with a value of $400K\u000a      has been secured which includes 50% support for a new lectureship (taken\u000a      up Vallejo-Fernandez).\u000a    All the major manufacturers of read heads in the world have modified both\u000a      the growth processes\u000a      for antiferromagnetic layers and their setting processes based on the new\u000a      physical insights into\u000a      exchange bias that we developed.\u000a    All work associated with the development of the York Model of Exchange\u000a      Bias was undertaken\u000a      here in York. The York Model has now displaced all other models of\u000a      exchange bias based on\u000a      computer simulations of complex AF domain structures. Working in\u000a      collaboration with Western\u000a      Digital in 2009, an increase in the maximum reported value of exchange\u000a      bias of more than a factor\u000a      2 to 3.6 kOe was reported. This system was designed using the York Model\u000a      and remains the\u000a      world record value [4].\u000a    The new insight into exchange bias materials that has been established\u000a      has improved the thermal\u000a      stability of the AF layers in certain designs of read heads by up to a\u000a      factor 2. The new\u000a      understanding has also enabled AF materials to be designed for purpose.\u000a      For example, for\u000a      perpendicular recording the overall thickness of the read head stack\u000a      determines the linear data\u000a      density along the track. In collaboration with Seagate in Northern\u000a      Ireland, studies have been\u000a      undertaken that allowed for the stack thickness to be reduced from 12nm to\u000a      6nm for certain\u000a      applications. This allows for a potential doubling of the linear density\u000a      along track although in\u000a      practice the increased resolution was used to improve signal to noise.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A new procedure for the measurement and characterisation of\u000a      polycrystalline exchange bias\u000a      systems has been developed which has impacted significantly the\u000a      manufacture of computer hard\u000a      drive read-heads by companies such as Seagate Inc and Western Digital\u000a      Corp.

Exchange bias systems are a ferromagnetic (F) film grown on an\u000a      antiferromagnetic\u000a      (AF) film pinning the magnetic orientation of the ferromagnet. Control of\u000a      the behaviour of an\u000a      antiferromagnetic material used in exchange bias systems is vital.

The\u000a      measurement protocols\u000a      developed at York based on this concept enables the so-called distribution\u000a      of blocking\u000a      temperatures of the AF grains to be determined. Such exchange bias\u000a      characterisation takes 15\u000a      hours per sample for a statistically significant measurement.\u000a    Using the developed exchange bias characterisation procedure, it was\u000a      found that the thermal\u000a      stability of the AF materials is a grain volume dependent effect. The\u000a      measurement of a grain\u000a      volume distribution is challenging. Typically 800 grains are required to\u000a      characterise the median\u000a      volume and the standard deviation. It was shown that the initial alignment\u000a      process used by\u000a      manufacturers was incomplete and a significant fraction of the grains were\u000a      not stable at room\u000a      temperature. The exchange bias effect is proportional to the integral over\u000a      the volume distribution.\u000a      The developed analysis procedure produced a remarkable fit to experimental\u000a      data for the film\u000a      thickness and the grain size within a series of films. It was possible to\u000a      predict the rate of alignment\u000a      of AF grains during the setting process. This has an impact on the design\u000a      of the setting\u000a      procedures used in manufacturing. The grain size work, whilst not\u000a      undertaken in collaboration with\u000a      industry, was rapidly adopted first by Western Digital Corporation and\u000a      subsequently by Seagate\u000a      Technology. These two companies manufacture 90% of the world's read heads\u000a      with a value of\u000a      ~$10Billion. Dr A Johnson (Vice President, Transducer Development, Seagate\u000a      Technology,\u000a      Northern Ireland in a letter of support states: \"(this work)...constituted\u000a      the only known mechanism\u000a      for assessing the degree of order and thermal stability of\u000a      antiferromagnetic grains.\"\u000a    The exchange bias work has shown that the interfaces between the layers\u000a      consist of spin clusters\u000a      whose alignment can occur spontaneously at low temperatures, be increased\u000a      by high setting fields\u000a      and behave independently of the AF grains. Subsequently O'Grady reported\u000a      on factors which\u000a      control the anisotropy of the AF grains including texture, composition and\u000a      impurities. The model\u000a      has been extended to explain exchange bias in single crystal and large\u000a      grain systems based on a\u000a      strong domain wall pinning concept.

ITER is\u000d\u000a      not an academic research facility: its goal is to integrate plasma\u000d\u000a      science, technologies and materials science to provide the first\u000d\u000a      demonstration of the technical feasibility of fusion energy. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      the construction of ITER involves industrial partners across the world,\u000d\u000a      including the UK, who benefit from the contracts it provides and the\u000d\u000a      technical skills it develops. Research that has an impact on the technical\u000d\u000a      feasibility of constructing ITER is therefore a non-academic impact,\u000d\u000a      immediately benefitting all the international partners involved in the\u000d\u000a      project.\u000d\u000a    Research performed at York on ELMs has had an impact on the ITER design\u000d\u000a      in three areas: (1) design of components close to the plasma surface; (2)\u000d\u000a      radio-frequency plasma heating systems, and (3) developing ELM control\u000d\u000a      techniques. Before our prediction that ELMs eject hot filaments of plasma,\u000d\u000a      it was thought that most of the heat lost in these events would be\u000d\u000a      transferred smoothly over the exhaust region at the bottom of the tokamak.\u000d\u000a      To handle the high heat loads expected, this is made from tungsten on\u000d\u000a      ITER. With our new prediction that hot plasma filaments could be ejected\u000d\u000a      far from the core, concern started to grow that they could damage other\u000d\u000a      components close to the plasma if not protected. This became a key issue\u000d\u000a      for ITER.\u000d\u000a    The plasma physics research for ITER is carried out by the research\u000d\u000a      institutions of the ITER parties (European Union, Russia, United States,\u000d\u000a      Japan, South Korea, China and India), coordinated by seven International\u000d\u000a      Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) Groups which operate under the auspices of\u000d\u000a      ITER (http:\/\/www.iter.org\/org\/team\/fst\/itpa). The Pedestal and Edge\u000d\u000a      Physics ITPA Group is responsible for research into ELMs, ensuring the\u000d\u000a      science of the international research community is fed into the ITER\u000d\u000a      design and that urgent research needs for the construction of ITER are\u000d\u000a      addressed. As a result of his contributions, Prof Wilson was appointed\u000d\u000a      chair of this group of the world's top experts in this field (about 35)\u000d\u000a      during 2007-2011 (he remains a formally appointed EU member). This\u000d\u000a      position provides a strong pathway to impact on ITER for Prof Wilson's\u000d\u000a      research on plasma filaments, which has now grown into a major research\u000d\u000a      activity of the group because of its importance for fusion. Specific\u000d\u000a      examples of the impact of York on the ITER design are :\u000d\u000a    (1) The detail design of ITER's first wall components: these have to\u000d\u000a      withstand the localised time-averaged heat fluxes from the ELMs which are\u000d\u000a      predicted to concentrate on particular areas of the first wall.\u000d\u000a      Predictions of the ELM filament structure have been used to evaluate the\u000d\u000a      most exposed locations to loads from ELMs and the beryllium-clad\u000d\u000a      protection of the ITER first wall has been upgraded to a higher capability\u000d\u000a      (4.7 MWm-2 instead of 2 MWm-2) to cope with them.\u000d\u000a      The final design review of ITER vacuum vessel protection took place in\u000d\u000a      April 2013 (http:\/\/www.iter.org\/newsline\/264\/1556).\u000d\u000a    (2) The detailed design of the radio-frequency antennas for plasma\u000d\u000a      heating on ITER: these must be positioned close to the plasma to be\u000d\u000a      effective and therefore need to be protected to avoid damage by the\u000d\u000a      erupting filaments of hot plasma. As well as the risk of damage, the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of the RF antennas for heating the plasma is influenced by\u000d\u000a      the localised plasma density structures associated with ELMs. For example,\u000d\u000a      the number of straps on ITER's antennas is designed based on the spatial\u000d\u000a      structure of the filaments as predicted by the original\u000d\u000a      \"peeling-ballooning\" theory for ELMs proposed by Professor Wilson and\u000d\u000a      quantified for ITER through research of the team of scientists of the ITPA\u000d\u000a      group chaired by him. The preliminary design review of the ICRH antenna,\u000d\u000a      costing around &#8364;24M, took place in May 2012 (http:\/\/www.iter.org\/newsline\/225\/1193)\u000d\u000a      and the final design review will take place in 2015.\u000d\u000a    3) ELM control schemes in ITER: In addition to large power fluxes on the\u000d\u000a      ITER first wall it is predicted that the large transient ELM heat loads\u000d\u000a      will rapidly erode the tungsten in the exhaust region of ITER, and\u000d\u000a      therefore ELMs will need to be controlled. Our theory, confirmed through\u000d\u000a      experiments coordinated by the ITPA PEP group, predicts that ELMs occur\u000d\u000a      when the pressure gradient at the edge of the plasma exceeds a threshold.\u000d\u000a      This led scientists at General Atomics (US) and CEA (France) to develop a\u000d\u000a      control system using an arrangement of coils around the plasma to degrade\u000d\u000a      the confinement, and relax the pressure gradient to switch off the ELMs.\u000d\u000a      This remains an active area of research around the world, but the\u000d\u000a      technique appears to work and a ~&#8364;100M ELM control coil system is now\u000d\u000a      being integrated into the ITER design whose final design review will take\u000d\u000a      place in December 2013. Although we have only played a small role in the\u000d\u000a      design of the control system, it is motivated by our theoretical\u000d\u000a      understanding of the mechanism that drives the plasma eruption.\u000d\u000a    The research leading to this impact is now international, involving many\u000d\u000a      scientists around the world. It was, however, initiated by our theoretical\u000d\u000a      model for ELMs and the eruption of hot plasma filaments, and fed into the\u000d\u000a      ITER design through the ITPA PEP group chaired by York through Prof Wilson\u000d\u000a      during 2007-2011. Concerning the theoretical development, Professor Wilson\u000d\u000a      led this research since 1998 while he was at Culham Centre for Fusion\u000d\u000a      Energy and then York (since 2005). A new computational code, ELITE, was\u000d\u000a      used to understand the ELM trigger and, although initiated by Professor\u000d\u000a      Wilson, benefitted from a strong collaboration with General Atomics (US);\u000d\u000a      that collaboration continues to this day (the research of the 4-man\u000d\u000a      GA-York team has been recognised by a prestigious 2013 American Physical\u000d\u000a      Society award, see above). The nonlinear theory was initiated just before\u000d\u000a      Professor Wilson's move to York, working in collaboration with Professor\u000d\u000a      Steve Cowley, then of Imperial College. However, at that time there was\u000d\u000a      some doubt about the relevance of the theory. Research continued at York\u000d\u000a      (and also stimulated related research around the world) to further advance\u000d\u000a      the theory and test it against experiments. Research at York includes\u000d\u000a      deriving the direction of the eruptions, and the development of a new\u000d\u000a      nonlinear MHD high performance computer code to simulate ELMs, BOUT++. Led\u000d\u000a      by Dr Dudson at York, the BOUT++ project benefits from close collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (US).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Although the world will have some time to wait until the full impact of\u000d\u000a      fusion energy is realised, there is substantial non-academic impact from\u000d\u000a      plasma science on the design of ITER. This &#8364;13Bn+ international facility,\u000d\u000a      under construction in France, is designed to demonstrate the technical\u000d\u000a      feasibility of fusion energy. Our research on plasma eruptions (like mini\u000d\u000a      solar flares), identified the need to protect ITER plasma facing\u000d\u000a      components from large, localised thermal loads. In addition, the antennas\u000d\u000a      for radio-frequency heating of ITER plasmas needed to be designed to take\u000d\u000a      account of the filamentary density structures that we predicted to be\u000d\u000a      associated with these eruptions.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of York\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"York (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of York","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007167}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Journals listed in the references below are all peer reviewed; citation\u000d\u000a      count from Web of Science\u000d\u000a    Key references for York staff on plasma eruptions\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] H R Wilson, et al Magneto-hydrodynamic stability of the H-mode\u000d\u000a        transport barrier as a model for edge-localised modes: an overview\u000d\u000a      Plas Phys Contr Fusion 48 A71 (2006) (51 citations)\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000a[2] P B Snyder, K H Burrell, H R Wilson, et al Stability and dynamics\u000d\u000a        of the edge pedestal in the low collisionality regime: physics\u000d\u000a        mechanisms for steady state ELM-free operation Nucl Fusion 47\u000d\u000a      961 (2007) (64 citations)\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000a[3] H R Wilson, Invited talk at IAEA Technical meeting on H-mode physics\u000d\u000a      and transport barriers Magneto-hydrodynamic stability of the H-mode\u000d\u000a        transport barrier as a model for edge-localised modes: an overview\u000d\u000a      (2005)\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000a[4] H.R.

Tokamak plasmas are vulnerable to a sequence of\u000d\u000a      repetitive plasma eruptions called Edge Localised Modes (ELMs &#8212; like mini\u000d\u000a      \"solar flares\"). Professor Howard Wilson developed the fundamental theory\u000d\u000a      for these eruptions that predicted: (i) ELMs occur when the edge plasma\u000d\u000a      pressure gradient exceeds a critical value [1-3] and (ii) the eruptions\u000d\u000a      violently eject filaments of hot plasma that could strike (and damage) the\u000d\u000a      components of the fusion reactor (2004-present) [4]. The latter prediction\u000d\u000a      was important as prior to this theory it was thought that ELMs blew off a\u000d\u000a      uniform shell of plasma into the tokamak exhaust region with little impact\u000d\u000a      on other components. The theory and its consequences were not universally\u000d\u000a      accepted, so following his move to York in 2005, Professor Wilson worked\u000d\u000a      with experimentalists on the MAST tokamak at Culham Centre for Fusion\u000d\u000a      Energy to confirm the prediction of the existence of filaments using high\u000d\u000a      speed camera images of the plasma [5,6]; erupting filaments during ELMs\u000d\u000a      have since been seen on all the world's leading tokamaks, transforming our\u000d\u000a      picture of what an ELM is. Specifically, the theory predicts, and\u000d\u000a      experiment observes, that hot plasma filaments from ELMs can strike\u000d\u000a      tokamak components, producing localised high thermal loads. While these\u000d\u000a      thermal loads are tolerable on today's tokamaks, on ITER where the thermal\u000d\u000a      energy will be much greater, they are likely to cause excessive damage.\u000d\u000a      Without Wilson's theory to guide experiments to search for filamentary\u000d\u000a      structures, it is unlikely they would have been detected in today's\u000d\u000a      tokamak experiments (they exist for just 50 microseconds, and travel at\u000d\u000a      10's km\/s). Consequently, the threat they pose to ITER components may not\u000d\u000a      have been appreciated, and the necessary additional protection not built\u000d\u000a      into the design of components.\u000d\u000a    The initial theory for the nonlinear evolution of ELMs, including the\u000d\u000a      prediction of erupting hot plasma filaments, was developed by Professor\u000d\u000a      Wilson in 2004, just before he moved to York in 2005. However, it was not\u000d\u000a      universally accepted at that time, so he continued to work in this area,\u000d\u000a      quantifying the theory's predictions [4] and working with experimental\u000d\u000a      colleagues to test it against experiments on MAST [5, 6]. The theory\u000d\u000a      guided new high performance computer simulations of ELMs by the York group\u000d\u000a      and others [7]. These experiments and simulations confirmed the theory and\u000d\u000a      firmly established filamentary eruptions during ELMs as a key issue for\u000d\u000a      future tokamaks. In 2006, Professor Wilson was awarded a &#163;658k EPSRC grant\u000d\u000a      to simulate plasma eruptions on high performance computers [11]. This\u000d\u000a      funded the development at York of a new ELM simulation code in 2009,\u000d\u000a      called BOUT++ [8], led by Dr Ben Dudson initially as a post-doc at York\u000d\u000a      and then as a Lecturer there since 2009. BOUT++ is an on-going project\u000d\u000a      working towards a quantitative predictive capability for ELM filaments on\u000d\u000a      ITER [8-10].

The Orion\u000a      laser was specifically designed to facilitate opacity experiments using\u000a      the technique. The first plasma experiment using this new laser was a\u000a      milestone opacity measurement (at specified density 4 gcm-3)\u000a      using the technique of this impact. Though details are obviously\u000a      classified and not published (for example, in order to make the\u000a      proliferation of weapons to new states or groups more difficult), it can\u000a      be surmised that the opacity of hot plasma is important in controlling\u000a      energy flow during weapon detonation and other aspects of nuclear weapons\u000a      design. The new opacity measurement technique is consequently helping AWE\u000a      to ensure the safe stockpiling of nuclear weapons without underground\u000a      testing and without the need to construct a &#163;1bn laser, as is being\u000a      developed by France and the US for stockpile stewardship.\u000a    An acknowledgement of the pivotal nature of the Kirchhoff's law opacity\u000a      work in plasma opacity work has been presented in a refereed publication\u000a      [S J Rose 2005 Plasma Phys. Control Fusion 47, B735 `New\u000a      experimental possibilities for measuring radiative opacity under\u000a      conditions in the Sun's interior'] The critical role of opacity in nuclear\u000a      weapons design is described in a 2002 open publication by the Ministry of\u000a      Defence Chief Scientific Advisor, [K O'Nions, R Pitman and C Marsh 2002\u000a      Nature 415, 853. `Science of nuclear warheads'.].\u000a    Since 2008, AWE effort has increasingly sought to make opacity\u000a      measurement using the `Kirchhoff's law' technique by using the AWE Helen\u000a      laser (up to 2010), paying for laser time at the Rutherford Appleton\u000a      Laboratory Central Laser Facility and by the construction of the &#163;150m\u000a      Orion laser at the AWE site Aldermaston. The Kirchhoff's law opacity\u000a      measuring technique for aluminium compressed to 4 gcm-3 using\u000a      shocks resulting from longer pulse lasers (to produce high density) and a\u000a      short pulse, high irradiance laser (for heating) was demonstrated on the\u000a      Orion laser in early 2013. This was the final commissioning test of the\u000a      new laser necessary to satisfy AWE contract obligations to the MoD. A York\u000a      PhD graduate supervised by Tallents (Lauren Hobbs &#8212; nee Gartside) took up\u000a      a staff position at AWE in 2011 in order to work on the opacity programme\u000a      under the supervision of Dr David Hoarty and contributed significantly to\u000a      the opacity milestone experiment using the `Kirchhoff's law' technique.\u000a      Hobbs presented the AWE milestone results for the first time at the\u000a      Institute of physics Annual Plasma Physics Conference in March 2013 in\u000a      York.\u000a    The US stockpile stewardship programme has recognised the success of the\u000a      UK approach and US experiments using the technique developed by Tallents\u000a      are now being developed and undertaken on the COMET laser at Lawrence\u000a      Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and in collaboration with AWE on the\u000a      Orion laser. A student of Tallents (Mohammed Shahzad half-funded by AWE)\u000a      took part in a 4-week opacity experiment at LLNL on the COMET laser in\u000a      November\/December 2012. Former student Lauren Hobbs (mentioned above) is\u000a      also involved in the work at LLNL. In 2013, a student fully-funded by AWE\u000a      (Valentiin Aslanyan) developed simulation results showing that the solid\u000a      density plasmas produced in buried layer experiments such as undertaken on\u000a      the Orion laser, can be modelled accurately assuming local thermodynamic\u000a      equilibrium (LTE) as the times for populations of moderate-Z\u000a      material to equilibrate are of order 10 - 50 fs.\u000a    Dr Tim Goldsack from AWE provided the following statement in relation to\u000a      this impact on 27th September 2013.\u000a    \"Under the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, AWE's task of stockpile\u000a      stewardship is challenging. In order to gain a deeper understanding of\u000a      nuclear-weapon physics for stewardship without underground nuclear tests\u000a      it is necessary to be able to create, and accurately diagnose, hot dense\u000a      plasmas. It had been thought that very large lasers (I.e. comparable in\u000a      performance &#8212; and hence cost &#8212; to the National Ignition Facility at LLNL\u000a      etc) would be needed. Prof. Tallents papers helped give rise to the idea\u000a      that a smaller (and hence significantly less expensive to build and\u000a      operate) laser, incorporating both long- and short-pulse beams could allow\u000a      researchers to gain access to hot, dense plasmas at lower cost, and,\u000a      indeed, open up other interesting and relevant areas of so-called\u000a      \"high-energy-density\" physics. This realisation led to the construction of\u000a      the Orion laser at AWE. Orion is currently being commissioned, but already\u000a      early test shots have shown the great promise of this approach, with high\u000a      temperatures (f0bb 600 eV) being achieved at greater than solid density.\u000a      There is a full programme of work planned for Orion, starting in April\u000a      2013 when commissioning is completed, and AWE is delighted to acknowledge\u000a      the significant contributions Prof Tallents has made.\u000a    It is also worth noting that AWE looks to the York Plasma Group for\u000a      potential recruits to the AWE Plasma Group, and recruited one recently.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The development by Tallents et al of a new plasma opacity measurement\u000a      technique contributed to the decision by the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD)\u000a      to construct the &#163;150 million Orion laser at the Atomic Weapons Laboratory\u000a      (AWE) for the measurement of material properties at high energy density.\u000a      Orion will enable AWE to measure e.g. opacities important in nuclear\u000a      weapons design without underground tests and at much lower cost than would\u000a      have been the case if it had followed the French and US programmes with\u000a      lasers costing over &#163;1 billion.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    University of York\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"York (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of York","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007167}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] R Smith, G J Tallents, S J Pestehe, G Hirst, J Lin, S Rose and M\u000a      Tagviashvili 1999 Laser and Particle beams 17, 477-485. `A\u000a      spectroscopic analysis of near solid density plasmas'.

The technique relies on\u000a      `Kirchhoff's law' relating emissivity to absorption for material in\u000a      thermal equilibrium. High power short pulse lasers were used to heat a\u000a      target comprising a thin layer of high Z material covered in\u000a      plastic and the emission from the `buried layer' recorded using a\u000a      spectrometer. The populations of quantum states were in local thermal\u000a      equilibrium (LTE) as the material was heated to temperatures &gt; 100 eV\u000a      before expansion lowered the material density significantly below the\u000a      solid value. Consequently, a hot (&gt;100 eV), dense (&#8776; 1 gcm-3)\u000a      plasma was formed which emitted over a short (&#8776; 1 ps) duration. From the\u000a      emission, the plasma opacity was evaluated using Kirchhoff's law. Papers\u000a      [1, 2] are published in specialist international peer review journals\u000a      often used for publicising high energy density plasma and radiative\u000a      transfer results.\u000a    The Kirchhoff's law method of opacity evaluation has been used to\u000a      benchmark opacity codes. Revisions to opacity codes led to more accurate\u000a      opacities used in astrophysics research and by AWE. The new technique has\u000a      advantages over the previously utilised opacity measurement method (where\u000a      another laser plasma x-ray emission `backlights' a plasma so that the\u000a      radiation transmission and hence opacity are measured). These advantages\u000a      are: (1) thin layers of material sandwiched in low Z material can\u000a      be used so that the plasma is uniform and at high density (greater than\u000a      solid density has been achieved), (2) the opacity of plasma at high\u000a      temperature (up to 1 keV) can be measured (with the backlighter method,\u000a      temperatures are limited by the achievable backlighter temperature).\u000a    The York Plasma and Fusion group have strongly contributed to more recent\u000a      opacity research utilising four EPSRC research grants [6]. These grants\u000a      further developed opacity measurement techniques whereby plasma-based\u000a      extreme ultra violet (EUV) lasers were used to probe high density, high\u000a      temperature plasmas created by synchronised optical laser irradiation of\u000a      solid targets [4]. The opacity target design here is similar to the\u000a      targets utilised for the Kirchhoff's law opacity measurements, but opacity\u000a      is measured from the transmission of the EUV laser through the target\u000a      after laser heating. Some of the advantages of the Kirchhoff's law method\u000a      of opacity measurements are preserved (e.g. thin tamped layers of material\u000a      are studied so that the plasma is dense and uniform), but the technique\u000a      does not require LTE and spectral resolution at the EUV laser wavelength\u000a      is improved by up to two orders-of-magnitude. The brightness of the EUV\u000a      laser ensures that that the opacity of hot plasma (up to 1 keV) can be\u000a      measured.\u000a    A detailed line accounting opacity code has been developed at York with\u000a      opacity predictions compared to measurements of EUV laser transmission and\u000a      earlier opacity measurements important for the revision of the Cepheid\u000a      variable opacities [4]. Work has expanded to consider opacity measurements\u000a      with low energy laser systems and with free-electron lasers [5].\u000a    An experiment to develop the Kirchhoff's law method of opacity\u000a      determination was scheduled via a Central Laser Facility, Rutherford\u000a      Appleton Laboratory experiment obtained following an application for\u000a      access from Professor Tallents. Tallents led the experimental team and the\u000a      experimental time was allocated to him as PI. Steven Rose now at Imperial\u000a      College led the theoretical opacity modelling for the experiment. The\u000a      results from the experiment were analysed over a number of years. Evidence\u000a      for the developing interest of AWE in the technique can be found in\u000a      reference [2] where Davidson and Nazir are AWE employees and Tallents and\u000a      his students, Smith and Pestehe are co-authors. Tallents and student\u000a      Pestehe moved to York in 1999 and Tallents further developed the\u000a      collaboration with AWE on opacity measurements with a series of\u000a      opacity-oriented grants [6]. The work at AWE is now led by Dr David\u000a      Hoarty. AWE experimental work continued on the technique at the Central\u000a      Laser Facility (CLF) during 2010 while the Helen laser was decommissioned.\u000a      The Orion laser was commissioned in 2013 with a milestone experiment\u000a      utilising the technique.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43437","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The CASTEP material modelling software developed by York academic Dr Matt\u000a      Probert and colleagues is a commercial software package to undertake\u000a      density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanical simulations. CASTEP is\u000a      marketed by Accelrys Inc and used by over 830 different companies\u000a      (including Boeing, Johnson Matthey, Dupont, Toyota, General Motors and\u000a      Unilever) and has generated over $30m sales since 2002. Accelrys is a\u000a      leading scientific research and development software and service company,\u000a      and is based in San Diego with European headquarters in Cambridge. It has\u000a      an established position in the field of materials modelling and simulation\u000a      currently based around the Materials Studio application, which includes\u000a      CASTEP as a separately licensed component.\u000a    One customer is the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota, which has used the\u000a      CASTEP code for a number of projects, which can be evidenced by a number\u000a      of patent applications. They use CASTEP to predict the properties of any\u000a      material using the power of quantum mechanics, and also to support\u000a      experimental studies of materials and processes by helping with the\u000a      interpretation of experiments, offering a unique `atom by atom'\u000a      perspective on what is happening.

A related topic is the green generation of\u000a      hydrogen to power these fuel cells, for which CASTEP has also been used\u000a      (ref 4 above).\u000a    A different commercial application using CASTEP is work by Sony to\u000a      develop light-weight flexible computer screen displays [iv] which was\u000a      reported at an Accelrys User Group conference.\u000a    CASTEP is widely used within many materials-based industries &#8212; see http:\/\/accelrys.com\/products\/materials-studio\/modules\/CASTEP.html\u000a      for a commercial overview.

DFT was conceived in the 1960s, though the theoretical\u000a      framework is still being actively developed, with important recent\u000a      contributions by academic staff at York (Professor Rex Godby and Dr Matt\u000a      Probert). The seminal CASTEP paper was published in 2002 [1] and Dr\u000a      Probert and Dr Phil Hasnip from Physics, York are co-authors describing\u000a      the development of the code.\u000a    CASTEP can be used to predict the properties of any material using the\u000a      power of quantum mechanics, and also to support experimental studies of\u000a      materials and processes by helping with the interpretation of experiments,\u000a      offering a unique `atom by atom' perspective. Sample published results\u000a      using the code for commercially important developments have been reported\u000a      in the open literature [2 - 3], but much industrial work is\u000a      commercial-in-confidence.\u000a    The underlying research and development of CASTEP began in 1999 with a\u000a      core team of UK academics &#8212; the CASTEP Developers Group (CDG) &#8212; and\u000a      continues to date. Probert and Hasnip are founding members of the CDG.\u000a      Probert joined the York Physics Department in 2000 and leads the York\u000a      contribution, which is responsible for the calculation of the groundstate\u000a      wavefunction, molecular dynamics and structure optimisation. Hasnip moved\u000a      to York in 2005 and works for Probert as a PDRA. The first complete\u000a      version of CASTEP was released in 2002, and there have been new releases\u000a      annually since then, with each new release incorporating new science\u000a      capabilities and calculation speed increases. The functionality developed\u000a      at York is fundamental to every CASTEP-based study.\u000a    The CDG currently comprises six academics: Probert (York), Hasnip (York),\u000a      Clark (Durham), Pickard (UCL), Refson (STFC), Yates (Oxford) and their\u000a      associated research groups. Each member of the core team is responsible\u000a      for writing and developing specific areas of functionality: Hasnip's\u000a      primary area is the calculation of the groundstate wavefunction, and\u000a      Probert's is molecular dynamics and structure optimisation.\u000a    In total, the York contribution to CASTEP amounts to more than 1\/3 of the\u000a      core of the code (both in terms of Probert and Hasnip having written more\u000a      than 1\/3 of the `lines of code' and in terms of core functionality)\u000a      providing key features that are needed by all users of the code. This core\u000a      functionality includes finding the ground state energy and wavefunction of\u000a      the system, and then using this to find the most stable arrangement of the\u000a      atoms within the material. This is the essential first step in any\u000a      CASTEP-based study. The core CASTEP functionality is summarised in ref\u000a      [5]. The York contribution underpins the more advanced functionality, such\u000a      as the calculation of the electronic band structure (using concepts\u000a      developed at York), the phonon dispersion, and many experimentally\u000a      important spectra such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Electron\u000a      Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Electron Energy Loss Spectoscopy (EELS), and\u000a      Raman spectroscopy.\u000a    The York team have also developed new algorithms (along with rigorous\u000a      theoretical proofs of correctness) that have been implemented to add extra\u000a      functionality to CASTEP. Examples include Langevin NPT molecular dynamics\u000a      [6] and a real-space genetic algorithm for crystal structure prediction\u000a      [7]. This functionality is used to simulate the finite temperature\u000a      properties of the material (Langevin NPT) and in finding new catalyst\u000a      structures using a genetic algorithm. Recently, Hasnip has developed a\u000a      novel approach to electronic energy minimization which is faster and more\u000a      robust, based upon mapping the charge density to an equivalent bosonic\u000a      system (paper under peer-review).\u000a    Probert has supervised five postgraduate research students and two PDRAs\u000a      since 2000 all of whom have contributed to the development of CASTEP,\u000a      either as collaborators in the development of new functionality and\/or as\u000a      users of the code. Most of the functionality developed has been\u000a      incorporated into the commercially available code, whilst the remainder is\u000a      available for independent download as an add-on via the group website (http:\/\/www.cmt.york.ac.uk\/cmd )\u000a      or the CASTEP website ( http:\/\/www.castep.org).\u000a    Through internal funding and by application to UK research council\u000a      funding, three successive Beowulf computer clusters have been installed at\u000a      York over the period 2002 - 12. These provided local high level computing\u000a      facilities enabling testing of code relevant to the development of the\u000a      CASTEP code, particularly the optimisation of parallelisation procedures.\u000a    Collaboration between the research groups of Godby and Probert and input\u000a      from an EU network on theoretical spectroscopy co-ordinated by Godby has\u000a      provided further impetus to CASTEP development. There have also been a\u000a      number of developments by the CDG in supporting industrial and other users\u000a      of the CASTEP code, such as the establishment of a community mailing list\u000a      and forum, web sites, and a number of training workshops attended by York\u000a      staff (most recently in Oxford (2013, 2009), Frankfurt (2012) and Delhi\u000a      (2011)).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43578","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The aurorae captivate the public imagination and there is a great deal of\u000d\u000a      interest in this beautiful and mysterious natural phenomenon. The impact\u000d\u000a      of AuroraWatch was highlighted when Channel 4 contacted Farideh Honary\u000d\u000a      (SAMNET PI) in 2006 mentioning that the phrase \"aurora borealis\" was in\u000d\u000a      the top 100 of most searched-for terms in MSN's UK search engine, and\u000d\u000a      asked if they could visit Lancaster to produce a programme on aurorae.\u000d\u000a      Since then, SPEARS scientists have given more than 20 national\/regional\u000d\u000a      radio interviews, have appeared on television to explain the auroral\u000d\u000a      phenomena, such as the BBC's Sky at Night (\"The Merry Dancers\", 2009,\u000d\u000a      ~200,000 expected audience) and Horizon (\"Solar storms &#8212; the threat to\u000d\u000a      Planet Earth\", 2012, 1,800,000 expected audience), and have delivered 32\u000d\u000a      talks to schools and 60 presentations to public audiences (~500\u000d\u000a      attendees). In addition to TV and radio programmes, AuroraWatch has\u000d\u000a      featured in 10 newspaper\/magazine articles since 2008 (RC2), and in the\u000d\u000a      book \"Field notes from a hidden city: An urban nature diary\" (Esther\u000d\u000a      Woolfson, 2013) (RC3). Lancaster's auroral research was the subject of a\u000d\u000a      short film (\"Written in the sky: aurora borealis explained\") produced by\u000d\u000a      the IOP in 2012 as part of the \"Physics Lives\" series, for A-level\u000d\u000a      students. It won a British Universities Film and Video Council award in\u000d\u000a      April 2013 and has over 16,960 viewings on YouTube (RC4).\u000d\u000a    The huge public interest is clear. AuroraWatch has over 109,000\u000d\u000a      subscribers, comprising 26,930 Twitter followers, 21,279 Facebook fans and\u000d\u000a      61,628 email subscribers. Users are encouraged to photograph the aurora\u000d\u000a      and share via our Flickr group, which has 771 members and 1,239 aurora\u000d\u000a      photographs since 2011. These numbers indicate a significant increase in\u000d\u000a      public engagement compared to 2008 when AuroraWatch had 22,000 subscribers\u000d\u000a      (RC5).\u000d\u000a    Professor Wild has delivered 12 enrichment lectures, to audiences of ~500\u000d\u000a      passengers, on board the Queen Victoria and Queen Mary cruise-liners\u000d\u000a      between 2008 and 2011. He has also delivered lectures to aurora\u000d\u000a      enthusiasts on four aurora pleasure flights (~130 passengers per trip).\u000d\u000a      The repeated invitations testify to the interest and impact of these\u000d\u000a      lectures (RC6).\u000d\u000a    The public support for AuroraWatch led to over 2500 individuals\u000d\u000a      expressing their concern to PPARC following its decision not to fund\u000d\u000a      SAMNET as a UK National Facility. At the time AuroraWatch had only 10,000\u000d\u000a      subscribers, hence the 2500 individual letters corresponds to 25% of\u000d\u000a      AuroraWatch subscribers. Their support letters constitute a four-volume\u000d\u000a      document which was sent to PPARC's Chief Executive. To view all these\u000d\u000a      letters, please see (RC7). Many AuroraWatch users are amateur astronomers\u000d\u000a      and radio amateurs. Following the public outcry over concerns that the\u000d\u000a      research council's decision might threaten the operation of SAMNET\u000d\u000a      magnetometers and the AuroraWatch service, Robert Goodwill, MP for\u000d\u000a      Scarborough and Whitby raised these concerns and questioned the Secretary\u000d\u000a      of State for Trade and Industry in Parliament over PPARC's decision\u000d\u000a      regarding SAMNET funding and the future of the AuroraWatch programme\u000d\u000a      (RC8). Following Mr Goodwill's intervention, Ben Wallace, MP for Lancaster\u000d\u000a      and Wyre, visited the SPEARS Group at Lancaster University in 2006 and\u000d\u000a      lobbied STFC (PPARC's successor) for the decision to be reconsidered. The\u000d\u000a      public support re-instated SAMNET's funding in 2007 (RC1).\u000d\u000a    According to a Royal Astronomical Society survey in October 2011,\u000d\u000a      AuroraWatch has had a significant impact on public's interest and\u000d\u000a      appreciation of science. The survey attracted 9971 responses (a response\u000d\u000a      rate of 25%, total number of AuroraWatch subscribers were &lt;40000 in\u000d\u000a      2011) and found a range of positive impacts. For example, as result of\u000d\u000a      subscribing to AuroraWatch, 3667 respondents report that they watch more\u000d\u000a      science on television, 1348 read more science magazines, 3089 read more\u000d\u000a      science websites and blogs, 524 now study or plan to study science and 865\u000d\u000a      participate in citizen science projects. More than 1400 subscribers listed\u000d\u000a      other changes in behaviour including an interest in amateur astronomy,\u000d\u000a      buying a telescope or booking a cruise to the Arctic to see the aurora\u000d\u000a      (RC9).\u000d\u000a    The RAS survey indicated that school pupils were the age group\u000d\u000a      least-represented in the survey respondents. To increase participation by\u000d\u000a      school pupils we developed a wireless, low-cost magnetometer and obtained\u000d\u000a      funding from Lancaster University to construct ten magnetometers. A\u000d\u000a      competition was launched to select ten schools that would best incorporate\u000d\u000a      the magnetometer and its data into their teaching of STEM subjects. 164\u000d\u000a      applications from across the UK were received. The selected schools will\u000d\u000a      involve 1800 pupils in AuroraWatch related activities, including projects\u000d\u000a      for CREST awards, astronomy, science, physics, engineering, electronics\u000d\u000a      and STEM clubs, and comparison with solar telescope, sunspot, VLF\u000d\u000a      receiver, muon detector and high-altitude balloon radiation detector data\u000d\u000a      (RC10). The impressive response has encouraged Lancaster to seek further\u000d\u000a      funding to involve more schools in AuroraWatch.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Lancaster undertakes fundamental research into the space plasma\u000d\u000a      environments.

This is one of the main research areas\u000d\u000a      conducted at Lancaster and has been supported by PPARC\/STFC and now by\u000d\u000a      NERC (RC1). Underpinning fundamental research into space plasmas, are a\u000d\u000a      family of ground-based experiments developed and are operated by Lancaster\u000d\u000a      space scientists which include ground-based magnetometers called SAMNET\u000d\u000a      (the UK Sub-Auroral Magnetometer Network).\u000d\u000a    Magnetic field variations measured by magnetometers are predominantly a\u000d\u000a      result of the coupling between the ionosphere, magnetosphere and solar\u000d\u000a      wind. In order to understand this global-scale system, it is necessary to\u000d\u000a      study magnetic field measurements spanning many hours of local time. In\u000d\u000a      practice, this means combining measurements from magnetometers located in\u000d\u000a      different locations, hence a need for operating a dense array of\u000d\u000a      magnetometers. Operation of SAMNET magnetometers was funded by PPARC\/STFC\u000d\u000a      from 2003-2010 under UK solar-terrestrial physics (STP) national\u000d\u000a      facilities. Following the transfer of ground-based STP from STFC to NERC,\u000d\u000a      Lancaster has secured NERC funding.\u000d\u000a    One of SAMNET's scientific objectives is the detection of increased\u000d\u000a      geomagnetic activity. In essence, during such intervals the coupling\u000d\u000a      between the Earth's magnetic field and the interplanetary magnetic field\u000d\u000a      (which is embedded in the solar wind) is enhanced. This activity gives\u000d\u000a      rise to increased auroral activity in mid- and high-latitude regions.\u000d\u000a      During particularly active periods, the Aurora Borealis can be seen from\u000d\u000a      the UK. AuroraWatch UK (part of SAMNET's magnetometer network) is a free\u000d\u000a      public outreach service which alerts subscribers by e-mail or via social\u000d\u000a      media applications when the likelihood of aurorae appearing over UK is\u000d\u000a      high.\u000d\u000a    Outputs from our fundamental research also contribute to a greater\u000d\u000a      appreciation of the risk and hazards posed by space weather. The\u000d\u000a      publications listed below in section 3 utilised SAMNET data to describe\u000d\u000a      the triggering of substorms (Ref.1-3), and the particle precipitation\u000d\u000a      dynamics during geomagnetic storm (Ref. 4-5). The sixth publication\u000d\u000a      illustrates the geomagnetically induced currents in power transmission\u000d\u000a      lines after the substorm onset.

Pollock and\u000d\u000a      Hammiche were the first\u000d\u000a      in the world to develop the ability to simultaneously deposit thermal\u000d\u000a      energy and measure\u000d\u000a      temperature changes on a sub-micron scale. This breakthrough was expanded\u000d\u000a      into a new generic\u000d\u000a      scanning thermal probe microscopy (SThM) technology, where purely thermal\u000d\u000a      modes of imaging\u000d\u000a      are complemented with localised analysis. For the first time individual\u000d\u000a      regions of a solid sample\u000d\u000a      could be selected by means of surface or even sub-surface imaging to\u000d\u000a      combine spatial\u000d\u000a      discrimination and chemical fingerprinting using calorimetry,\u000d\u000a      thermomechanometry, infrared\u000d\u000a      spectroscopy and pyrolysis mass spectrometry.

The 1st International Workshop on\u000d\u000a      Spectral Diagnostics\u000d\u000a      (2007) proved to be a landmark event pointing the way forwards for\u000d\u000a      clinicians to make use of\u000d\u000a      spectroscopic instrumentation.

In the same way that electrons\u000d\u000a      with specific energies cannot travel through a semiconductor like silicon\u000d\u000a      because of an energy band gap, photonic crystals have photonic\u000d\u000a      band gaps that block wavelengths of light at a certain range of\u000d\u000a      frequencies and prevent them from propagating. This band structure is\u000d\u000a      created using man-made periodic structures rather than natural crystal\u000d\u000a      structures. Physicists are therefore free to use patterns that do not\u000d\u000a      occur in nature and fabricate these in well understood materials such as\u000d\u000a      silicon.\u000d\u000a    Researchers at Southampton found that creating an array of microscopic\u000d\u000a      holes a couple of hundred nanometres deep in dielectric layers of a\u000d\u000a      silicon nitride substrate [3.2] disrupted the periodicity of the\u000d\u000a      lattice structure, allowing them to bend light around corners at\u000d\u000a      sub-millimetre scale while avoiding light escaping at the corners (which\u000d\u000a      would weaken the signal) [3.3]. Further research demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      multiple optical functions and complex systems could be implemented at\u000d\u000a      high density on a single silicon chip, paving the way for low-cost,\u000d\u000a      high-volume production of integrated optical devices. A US patent was\u000d\u000a      applied for an invention relating to optical devices incorporating\u000d\u000a      structures exhibiting a photonic band gap in April 2001 and granted in\u000d\u000a      2005 [3.4].\u000d\u000a    This intellectual property formed the basis of the establishment in July\u000d\u000a      2001 of Mesophotonics Ltd. (a partnership between Baumberg, Parker and\u000d\u000a      BTG, a company specialising in commercialising technologies) to further\u000d\u000a      develop the photonic crystal devices and take them to market. In 2004\u000d\u000a      Professor Baumberg received the Royal Society's prestigious Mullard Award\u000d\u000a      for his work in nanoscience and nanotechnology and for his contribution to\u000d\u000a      the national prosperity of the UK through the spin-out company\u000d\u000a      Mesophotonics Ltd. in developing optical chips. Professor Baumberg\u000d\u000a      continued to contribute to the development of nanophotonic devices until\u000d\u000a      he moved to the University of Cambridge in 2007. Research, development and\u000d\u000a      implementation of photonics quasi-crystals in LED epitaxy has been\u000d\u000a      followed up by Dr Martin Charlton, (1999-present, Reader at ECS) one of\u000d\u000a      the co-founders of Mesophotonics, who trained in the group led by\u000d\u000a      Professor Baumberg. Dr Martin Charlton is currently collaborating with\u000d\u000a      Prof Pavlos Lagoudakis (2006-present; Deputy Head for Research, P&amp;A)\u000d\u000a      in tuning photonic crystal geometries for optimising colour conversion in\u000d\u000a      LEDs [3.7].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43855","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research by the University of Southampton's Astronomy Group has gone\u000d\u000a      beyond solving galactic riddles, radically improving the capability of\u000d\u000a      security agencies to detect dirty bomb threats and contributing to tighter\u000d\u000a      safety procedures in the nuclear industry.\u000d\u000a    Responding to US government calls for technology that could be used at\u000d\u000a      ports to detect suspect radioactive materials, spin-out company Symetrica\u000d\u000a      [5.1] set out to adapt the Southampton team's original gamma-ray detector,\u000d\u000a      which had performed successfully in space exploration. Existing detection\u000d\u000a      systems, housed in `portals', were unable to discriminate between\u000d\u000a      different threat and natural radiation sources. Symetrica developed its\u000d\u000a      original gamma-ray detector &#8212; its spectroscopic capabilities enable it to\u000d\u000a      distinguish different radiation sources and accurately identify threat\u000d\u000a      materials hidden in heavily shielded containers &#8212; to make a system that\u000d\u000a      could be used in a portal and in a handheld detector as a second layer of\u000d\u000a      surveillance.\u000d\u000a    In 2006 Symetrica partnered with Smiths Detection, a world-leading\u000d\u000a      provider of detection systems for X-rays, explosives and traces of\u000d\u000a      radioactive materials, which led to a $222m contract from the US\u000d\u000a      Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office\u000d\u000a      (DNDO) to develop next-generation radiation detection and identification\u000d\u000a      systems. This move was crucial in giving Symetrica access to the key US\u000d\u000a      government market. In September 2008 Smiths Detection announced the launch\u000d\u000a      of the partnership's High Performance Radioisotope Identifier (HPRID), a\u000d\u000a      next-generation handheld device for detecting and identifying highly\u000d\u000a      enriched uranium, plutonium and other radioactive materials. A choice of\u000d\u000a      either a NaI or LaBr3 crystal and a neutron detector identify\u000d\u000a      and analyse the specific potential threat. The HPRID was based on\u000d\u000a      Symetrica's original Discovery&#8482; technology for isotope detection and\u000d\u000a      identification.\u000d\u000a    The collaboration between Symetrica and Smiths led to further success in\u000d\u000a      2011 when their RadSeeker handheld radioisotope identifier, which\u000d\u000a      superseded the HPRID, was approved by the DHS's DNDO as its primary\u000d\u000a      radiological handheld detector device [5.2, 5.3] to help port and border\u000d\u000a      personnel evaluate cargo, containers and vehicles as part of the US\u000d\u000a      government's counter-terrorism efforts.\u000d\u000a    Smiths received an initial production order for $4.5m in May 2011, built\u000d\u000a      around Symetrica's key isotope identification and spectrum stabilisation\u000d\u000a      technologies employed in this device. In 2012, the DHS announced the\u000d\u000a      purchase of RadSeeker DL instruments for $8.3m. As a result of this\u000d\u000a      decision, Symetrica's technology was deployed by the Honolulu Emergency\u000d\u000a      Services Department, through US Government grant funding, to screen\u000d\u000a      tsunami debris as it reached Hawaii in the aftermath of the Fukushima\u000d\u000a      disaster [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Symetrica has grown into an international company with 26 employees in\u000d\u000a      the UK and the USA &#8212; a number that is expected to grow by 30% in 2013-2014\u000d\u000a      with RadSeeker entering full production. Its forecast turnover is &#163;10m.\u000d\u000a      Symetrica Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Symetrica Ltd, was founded in\u000d\u000a      the USA, with a manufacturing and testing facility in Maynard, MA.\u000d\u000a      Symetrica has a strong R&amp;D programme in the UK itself, and has funded\u000d\u000a      PhD studentships at the Universities of Southampton and Surrey. It has\u000d\u000a      also successfully bid for more than &#163;100k of DTI\/EPSRC funding on the\u000d\u000a      basis of collaborative research with the University of Southampton [5.5,\u000d\u000a      5.6].\u000d\u000a    Symetrica's shift in market focus from space to security is the key to\u000d\u000a      its current success and is attributable to a decision taken by commercial\u000d\u000a      advisers at SETsquared, an organisation that supports spin-outs from the\u000d\u000a      five universities of Southampton, Exeter, Bristol, Bath and Surrey.\u000d\u000a      SETsquared matched the Southampton astronomy team with a mentor, Heddwyn\u000d\u000a      Davies, now the chief executive of Symetrica, who targeted the security\u000d\u000a      sector as Symetrica's primary market.\u000d\u000a    Symetrica's Homeland Security portfolio now includes scalable, 3He-free\u000a      neutron detectors, inexpensive Radiation Portal Monitors (RPMs) that can\u000d\u000a      reduce nuisance alarms alarm rates during cargo screening and RPMs\u000d\u000a      equipped with crystal spectrometers that provide a greatly enhanced\u000d\u000a      isotope-identification capability. With all three of these technologies\u000d\u000a      entered into the European Illicit Trafficking Radiation Assessment Program\u000d\u000a      (ITRAP+10), Symetrica's footprint on the Homeland Security Market has\u000d\u000a      significantly increased. A prototype portal monitor, trialled at the Port\u000d\u000a      of Felixstowe, demonstrated its effectiveness in distinguishing naturally\u000d\u000a      occurring radioactive materials from potential threat materials. The trial\u000d\u000a      system reduced the number of manual secondary inspections of cargo by\u000d\u000a      customs personnel at the port by ~80%.\u000d\u000a    Already partnered with Smith's detection, Symetrica is now in discussions\u000d\u000a      with two other market-leading prime contractors who wish to use their\u000d\u000a      technology.\u000d\u000a    The story behind the Symetrica spin-out was highlighted as an example of\u000d\u000a      best practice by The Engineer magazine in 2011 [5.7], and in\u000d\u000a      February 2012 the Duke of York visited Symetrica's headquarters at the\u000d\u000a      University's Science Park, to learn how its technology is winning export\u000d\u000a      sales for the UK [5.8].\u000d\u000a    Symetrica continues to be research-active and has filed 15 patents since\u000d\u000a      its launch. There is a programme of continued collaboration between the\u000d\u000a      School of Physics and Astronomy and Symetrica in the field of detector\u000d\u000a      development. Funded studentships, supervised by Bird, were completed in\u000d\u000a      2009 and 2011 and the findings fed into products now offered by Symetrica.\u000d\u000a      The first student (Dr C Burt) carried out the initial development for\u000d\u000a      large area PVT detectors to act as low-cost replacements for traditional\u000d\u000a      scintillation counters. The second student (Dr M Foster) worked on\u000d\u000a      extending these detectors in the search for a replacement for Helium-3\u000d\u000a      neutron detectors and is now a Symetrica employee in their research\u000d\u000a      department. Both these developments are now marketed as components within\u000d\u000a      the Symetrica Radiation Portal Monitor (RPM) range, which offer a &gt;75%\u000d\u000a      nuisance alarm reduction and improved isotope identification capability\u000d\u000a      compared to other available systems.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Southampton's distinguished body of work on the design\u000d\u000a      of technology for gamma-ray detection and imaging has informed new\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism practices.

Symetrica's core technologies\u000d\u000a      resulted from a combination of the research activities carried out within\u000d\u000a      the group and specifically within the teams working in instrument design\u000d\u000a      and construction.\u000d\u000a    Dr Tony Bird, Reader in the School of Physics and Astronomy\u000d\u000a      (1987-present), led the advancement of small low-power\u000d\u000a      scintillator-photodiode radiation detectors for the development programme\u000d\u000a      of the European Space Agency's (ESA) INTEGRAL space telescope [3.1, G1,\u000d\u000a      G2]. The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory is the most\u000d\u000a      sensitive gamma-ray observatory to date and, through the analysis of\u000d\u000a      gamma-ray bursts in space, aims to solve some of astronomy's biggest\u000d\u000a      mysteries.\u000d\u000a    As a postdoctoral researcher, Bird optimised the design of gamma-ray\u000d\u000a      detectors, creating a technology (paper published in 1993) that was more\u000d\u000a      cost-effective and robust than existing detectors (standard NaI(Tl)\/PMT\u000d\u000a      combinations) and, crucially, did not require a high-voltage supply that\u000d\u000a      might cause equipment failure in space. These sensitive radiation\u000d\u000a      detectors paved the way for highly segmented 2D gamma-ray detector arrays,\u000d\u000a      which can provide high-resolution spectroscopy as well as imaging\u000d\u000a      capability.\u000d\u000a    Essential gamma-ray imaging technologies were developed [G1, G2] by teams\u000d\u000a      led by Professor A Dean, now a Professor Emeritus within the Astronomy\u000d\u000a      Group following his retirement in 2009, and Dr D Ramsden, who retired in\u000d\u000a      1996 and founded Symetrica in 2002, where he is now chief technical\u000d\u000a      officer and head of research. The resulting imaging systems relied on the\u000d\u000a      temporal or spatial modulation of the incident gamma-ray flux using high-Z\u000d\u000a      materials and produced images of far higher quality than previously\u000d\u000a      possible. These systems are now ubiquitous in high-energy imaging systems\u000d\u000a      for space astronomy and also form the basis for `stand-off imaging' (i.e.\u000d\u000a      from distance) in homeland security and nuclear industry applications\u000d\u000a      [3.2, 3.3, G3].\u000d\u000a    Led by Dr Fan Lei, a postdoctoral researcher at the time (left\u000d\u000a      Southampton in 2000), research into instrument modelling guided the\u000d\u000a      INTEGRAL Mass Model project [3.4, G5] an independent and uniform\u000d\u000a      instrument and spacecraft modelling program for ESA. Using data on mass\u000d\u000a      distribution and chemical composition of material in the instruments, Dr\u000d\u000a      Lei formed a Monte Carlo model of the whole payload to assess the\u000d\u000a      performance of each instrument and identify any flaws. It was the first\u000d\u000a      time simulations had provided detailed and useful satellite design input.\u000d\u000a      Simulations were used to optimise the response of the detectors to gamma\u000d\u000a      rays, inform the calibration strategy and support data analysis after\u000d\u000a      launch. Simulations were also used in designing the detector geometry to\u000d\u000a      ensure high and uniform light collection from the scintillation counters,\u000d\u000a      producing the best possible spectral resolution.\u000d\u000a    Research into spectral response modelling through signal processing and\u000d\u000a      mathematical modelling led to some of Symetrica's core technology for\u000d\u000a      isotope identification [3.5, 3.6]. These methods allow a detector spectrum\u000d\u000a      to be deconvolved into the component isotope signatures, enabling accurate\u000d\u000a      identification and quantification of radioactive materials.\u000d\u000a    The combination of these technologies provided Symetrica with an initial\u000d\u000a      portfolio of radiation detection products and continues to inform the\u000d\u000a      company's development of innovative radiation detection solutions.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43856","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The substantial international effort that has led to the `birth' of\u000d\u000a      commercially available ytterbium-doped\u000d\u000a      silica fibre light sources for materials processing and nonlinear optics\u000d\u000a      was triggered by\u000d\u000a      Tropper and Hanna's research.

[3.3] is an early report of an\u000d\u000a      ytterbium-doped fibre amplifier (YDFA),\u000d\u000a      possibly the second in the literature, following a publication from Gerard\u000d\u000a      Mourou at Rochester in\u000d\u000a      1996 that cites [3.2] in its motivation. [3.4] is the\u000d\u000a      first publication to analyse the performance of\u000d\u000a      the YDFA systematically, and show quantitatively how variation in fibre\u000d\u000a      length, dopant\u000d\u000a      concentration and pump characteristics control the gain and bandwidth of\u000d\u000a      these devices. [3.5]\u000d\u000a      describes the properties of a superfluorescent broadband source based on\u000d\u000a      ytterbium-doped fibre,\u000d\u000a      and [3.6] is the first publication to discuss the lifetime\u000d\u000a      quenching effects that proved to be a major\u000d\u000a      technological challenge as YDF sources scaled into the kilowatt average\u000d\u000a      power regime. The\u000d\u000a      research was funded by EPSRC [3.7, 3.8].\u000d\u000a    Two of these papers [3.2, 3.4] have together been cited more than\u000d\u000a      600 times on Web of Science to\u000d\u000a      date, laying the foundation for the continuing development around the\u000d\u000a      world of high power,\u000d\u000a      continuous-wave and ultrafast short-pulse lasers and amplifiers.\u000d\u000a    In summary, Hanna and Tropper were the first researchers to demonstrate\u000d\u000a      ytterbium-doped\u000d\u000a      silica fibre as an optical gain medium, to investigate the physics of the\u000d\u000a      YDFA, and to identify the\u000d\u000a      capability of this technology.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43857","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The process (from research to impact)\u000d\u000a    The spin-out company Covesion was itself spun out from a parent company,\u000d\u000a      Stratophase (another spin-out of the University started 2003), in 2009, to\u000d\u000a      better focus on research and development of its nonlinear optical\u000d\u000a      materials product line [5.1]. Following the first sales of PPLN to\u000d\u000a      GEC-Marconi, PPLN research has developed into a successful commercial\u000d\u000a      venture since the formation of the separate company Covesion. With fresh\u000d\u000a      venture capital investment, Covesion developed new Intellectual Property\u000d\u000a      around poling of MgO-doped PPLN for high power applications, technology\u000d\u000a      that had been pioneered at Southampton. At its inception Covesion\u000d\u000a      comprised only the two former Stratophase staff members working on PPLN.\u000d\u000a      Since then it has created five high-tech jobs and achieved sales worth\u000d\u000a      &#163;2.1million over three years, 95 per cent of these sales being to overseas\u000d\u000a      customers [5.2, 5.3].\u000d\u000a    Economic impact\u000d\u000a    Covesion customers include some of the world's most successful companies\u000d\u000a      and prestigious research institutes, including some University-based\u000d\u000a      former PPLN research groups, not all of which can be named explicitly\u000d\u000a      here, for reasons of confidentiality, but span the areas of defence,\u000d\u000a      communications, laser manufacturing and medicine. New business has\u000d\u000a        therefore been created. The list includes major corporations such as\u000d\u000a      [text removed for publication]. [5.2]. From recent measurements of the\u000d\u000a      performance of these nonlinear engineered crystals, where 45W of green\u000d\u000a      light has been generated from an input near-infrared laser beam,\u000d\u000a      [reported by Stanford University, in 2012 [5.4] it is clear that\u000d\u000a      high-power lasers can now be built in a far more cost-effective manner\u000d\u000a      using Covesion components, and such impressive results have led to further\u000d\u000a      patent activity [5.5].\u000d\u000a    Another area that demonstrates economic impact relates to the use\u000d\u000a      of these engineered crystals in laser projection systems for presentations\u000d\u000a      and displays that have brighter, clearer colours but which use less energy\u000d\u000a      than conventional light bulb-based units, and therefore represents an\u000d\u000a      activity that has an impact on the environment also (management of\u000d\u000a        energy). Consumer demand in this area is growing rapidly, as\u000d\u000a      products are marketed for home cinema, desktop projectors and\u000d\u000a      rear-projection. Future opportunities are projectors integrated into\u000d\u000a      mobile phones and laptops, as well as use in medical screening and aero\u000d\u000a      defence equipment. Covesion has entered into a license agreement and\u000d\u000a      technology transfer programme with a leading projector company, [text\u000d\u000a      removed for publication]. [5.2].\u000d\u000a    The final claim under economic impact is that the crystals sold by\u000d\u000a      Covesion are essential parts of new laser systems and applications, which\u000d\u000a      has a significant value to global trade. The crystals are integrated into\u000d\u000a      high-end products which are sold by Covesion customers, so the leverage\u000d\u000a      effect is considerable, and vital to the success of these companies. The\u000d\u000a      company's own analysis of sales of these systems and the volume of\u000d\u000a      products shipped suggests that the total worldwide market value of\u000d\u000a      Covesion-enabled commerce is greater than US$25m per year (hence US$100m\u000d\u000a      since 2009) [5.2]. A ready example concerns Covesion products that are\u000d\u000a      used in short-pulse fibre lasers which are sold by at least three\u000d\u000a      manufacturers. Publicised users to date include Oclaro Inc., one of the\u000d\u000a      world's largest suppliers of optical communications equipment, the\u000d\u000a      world-leading universities Harvard and Stanford and leading governmental\u000d\u000a      research organisations such as NASA.\u000d\u000a    Health Impacts\u000d\u000a    Other key applications for Covesion products lay in the area of medical\u000d\u000a      imaging, where 2-photon fluorescence microscopy that uses Covesion\u000d\u000a      crystals enables imaging of living tissue, an area of immediate concern\u000d\u000a      for real-time medical diagnostics. Covesion have also played a key role in\u000d\u000a      the consortium working on the EU-funded CROSS TRAP (Coherently-enhanced\u000d\u000a      Raman One-beam Standoff Spectroscopic Tracing of Airborne Pollutants)\u000d\u000a      project [5.6], which addresses the development of a novel laser remote\u000d\u000a      sensing technique for probing air at a distance for hazards such as\u000d\u000a      biochemicals, bacterial threats and explosive materials. Both of these\u000d\u000a      areas fall under the heading of new diagnostics for medical\u000d\u000a        technologies.\u000d\u000a    A final area which falls under the heading of quality of life impact,\u000d\u000a      concerns the impact on society through provision of essential components\u000d\u000a      in systems that protect the public and armed forces of several nations &#8212; preventing future loss of life. Under UK export licenses, Covesion\u000d\u000a      crystals are used as wavelength conversion components in laser\u000d\u000a      countermeasure systems on over 90 commercial aircraft [5.2]. These involve\u000d\u000a      directing laser beams towards an approaching missile, causing it to veer\u000d\u000a      off course. [text removed for publication].

The field of\u000d\u000a      nonlinear optical research has grown rapidly following the invention of\u000d\u000a      the laser in 1960. Although it may be comparatively easy to demonstrate\u000d\u000a      laser action in a particular material, unless the lasing wavelength\u000d\u000a      produced is optimum for the end application, nonlinear optical techniques\u000d\u000a      are needed to convert the primary wavelength into the one required, and to\u000d\u000a      do this with the highest efficiency possible.\u000d\u000a    One technique for achieving such efficient wavelength conversion is\u000d\u000a      called `quasi-phase-matching', which involves the manipulation of a\u000d\u000a      crystal structure by periodically modifying its internal crystalline\u000d\u000a      properties (specifically modifying the sign of specific nonlinear\u000d\u000a      coefficients) at length scales that fall into the few micron range.\u000d\u000a      Suggested first in the early 1960s, little practical progress was made in\u000d\u000a      the area until the early 1990s, when techniques emerged to successfully\u000d\u000a      fabricate these engineered crystals with the correct periodicity and\u000d\u000a      quality. Three research groups at Sony corporation in Japan, Stanford\u000d\u000a      University in California, and the laser group at Southampton (see below\u000d\u000a      for details), independently developed and refined the fabrication\u000d\u000a      techniques required, using lithium niobate crystals as the optimum\u000d\u000a      starting material, to produce the final product known as PPLN\u000d\u000a      (periodically poled lithium niobate). In 1994, researchers at Southampton\u000d\u000a      published a key result using a novel approach which involved periodic\u000d\u000a      structuring using liquid electrodes [3.1] which produced the small periods\u000d\u000a      required with excellent fidelity, a result that followed soon after the\u000d\u000a      first reports from Sony in 1993 and Stanford University in 1994.

In particular, one\u000d\u000a      of the most commercially important contributions to the technology lay in\u000d\u000a      developing a simple process for periodic poling of magnesium oxide doped\u000d\u000a      crystals, which allows them to be used in high-power applications and at\u000d\u000a      higher temperatures.\u000d\u000a    In 2009, the spin-out company Covesion was founded by Professor Peter\u000d\u000a      G.R.

However a major step occurred in the 1990s when Llewellyn-Jones\u000a      was able to use evidence from ATSR-1 to show that the ATSR sea surface\u000a      temperature (SST) data were capable of forming a climate SST data set and\u000a      hence an important public utility for government. As a result, the\u000a      predecessor departments to the Department of Energy and Climate Change\u000a      (DECC) agreed to fund the third AATSR instrument for climate science and\u000a      policy support, bringing a series of research instruments together to form\u000a      a system for obtaining surface temperature data with climate quality as\u000a      advocated by Leicester [a].\u000a    DECC is now the lead Department for Government policies on both\u000a      international and domestic climate change mitigation, and a strong science\u000a      evidence base is crucial for developing these policies. DECC fully\u000a      recognises the importance of sea surface temperature as one of the\u000a      essential climate variables (ECVs), and that the most accurate climate\u000a      time series for SSTs are those that have been derived from the ATSR\u000a      instrument series as described in the Leicester research section. Results\u000a      from Leicester on the quality validation, interpretation and subsequent\u000a      application of these high quality ATSR SST records, on their\u000a      interpretation and on corroboration of the historical in situ record have\u000a      made an important contribution to the scientific evidence that informs the\u000a      development of government policy with respect to reductions of greenhouse\u000a      gas emissions and the UK's own requirements to reduce greenhouse gas\u000a      emissions by 80% by 2050 [a,b].The ATSR data have also contributed\u000a      to the UK government's commitment to climate monitoring obligations under\u000a      the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC)\u000a      treaty [c].\u000a    Internationally, in terms of climate impact, the datasets and their\u000a      comparisons to in situ time series of global mean SST are cited for the\u000a      first time in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th\u000a      Assessment Report [a,d]. Hence the ATSR observations of temperature\u000a      change are part of the evidence chain open to international government\u000a      scrutiny and important at a time of apparent hiatus in surface temperature\u000a      warming.\u000a    The AATSR has also had an increasing and unexpected impact on operational\u000a      oceanography both during its lifetime [e] and on successor sensors\u000a      [f] respectively, due particularly to the work carried out by\u000a      Corlett in assessing the accuracy of ATSR data and implementing\u000a      operational functionalities for data quality. Reference [e]\u000a      describes how the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST), by providing\u000a      access to AATSR data, has enabled operational services using AATSR data.\u000a      These successes have been used to define the requirements for operational\u000a      ocean services as part of the European Commission GMES\/Copernicus service\u000a      (the Earth Observation equivalent of Galileo for navigation) resulting in\u000a      an EC-funded Sea and Land Surface Temperature instrument (SLSTR or ATSR-4)\u000a      on the Sentinel-3 satellite. This instrument is deliberately ATSR-like in\u000a      technique, accuracy and precision [f]. Llewellyn-Jones and Remedios\u000a      have vigorously used Leicester results, and those of the international\u000a       ATSR community, to support the views of operational users as to the\u000a      importance and utility of ATSR-type data for the future.\u000a    The impact on operational oceanography was so strong that an unexpected\u000a      benefit of AATSR has been its use within a sea surface temperature\u000a      analysis system which is used to drive the forecast models for weather\u000a      forecasting at the Met Office and the European Centre for Medium Range\u000a      Weather Forecasting [g]. This is because of the AATSR data's great\u000a      utility for correcting the biases of other sea surface temperature\u000a      observations which feed into the analysis and then the weather forecasts [h],\u000a      as demonstrated by Corlett's work at Leicester\u000a    Finally, Leicester ATSR science has specifically contributed to public\u000a      information on climate science. Llewellyn-Jones at Leicester worked very\u000a      closely with exhibition staff, on behalf of DECC, to arrange the AATSR\u000a      engineering model as one of the centrepieces of the \"Atmosphere &#8212; exploring climate science\" gallery in the Science Museum in South\u000a      Kensington, opened in December 2010 by HRH The Prince of Wales. The model\u000a      hangs from the roof of this special exhibit and is thus visible to the\u000a      huge numbers of visitors per year (&gt;1.5 million; 737,000 in the first\u000a      year compared to 400,000 target). Accompanying interactive display\u000a      material is based on interviews with Llewellyn-Jones, because of his PI\u000a      role, and includes a video presentation by Llewellyn-Jones explaining the\u000a      science and the provision of credible observational evidence on surface\u000a      temperature change.

These UK-funded, thermal infra-red\u000a      sensors of novel design were instigated explicitly to achieve the accuracy\u000a      in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) necessary to investigate climate change\u000a      in recent decades; Leicester research has been central to the effort to\u000a      demonstrate performance and evidence the ATSR observations of SSTs.\u000a    Llewellyn-Jones has been the Principal Investigator of the ATSRs\u000a      throughout their lifetimes and led this multi-institutional project from\u000a      the development and use of novel research instruments to climate policy\u000a      relevant operational systems. The instruments and science programmes for\u000a      the first two instruments (ATSR-1; ATSR-2) were funded by SERC and NERC,\u000a      and later instruments by impact-orientated agencies (see impact section).\u000a      Remedios has been the Science Manager for the ATSRs since 2003 and Dr.\u000a      Gary Corlett has been the Leicester ATSR Validation Scientist since 2004.\u000a    Detailed scientific research at Leicester has focussed on sea surface\u000a      temperature data with its accuracy, trends and time series as a prime\u000a      driver of our work [1-6]. A major key step forward came in 2004\u000a      when Sean Lawrence together with Llewellyn-Jones published a paper [1]\u000a      showing that time tendencies (or trends) in sea surface temperature data\u000a      could be observed very well in the ATSR data, even over short timescales,\u000a      and also in other satellite data sets [2].\u000a    The next steps were to establish the true quality of the ATSR sea surface\u000a      temperature data and to improve the data retrieval skill to maximise the\u000a      data quality. Within the Unit, extensive research (see [3] and references\u000a      therein; [4, 5]) was required involving leadership of international,\u000a      collaborative teams of scientists analysing standard ocean sensor systems\u000a      and dedicated ship cruise data to validate the data. The state-of-the-art\u000a      Leicester results of this investigation are detailed in papers showing\u000a      that current ATSR data are accurate to better than 0.3 K per pixel with\u000a      low bias of less than 0.05 K [4, 5 and references in 3] and\u000a      0.015 K on a monthly global mean [3].\u000a    The culmination of the Leicester ATSR research has been to produce\u000a      climate records demonstrating that ATSR data are highly suitable for\u000a      climate research, which independently corroborate (for the first time) the\u000a      in situ record which has been historically used to document surface\u000a      temperature change, and which confirm the low uncertainty and low bias in\u000a      climate temperature records [3, 6]. These findings are evidenced in\u000a      Chapter 2 and Figure 2.17 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u000a      (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report see impact below) in which three\u000a      co-authored Leicester papers on SSTs are referenced, including [5]\u000a      and [6]).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44003","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Science and Technology Facilities Council","UK Space Agency"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The strength of this EOS research, with its wide ranging set of\u000d\u000a      Physics-based Earth Observation (EO) capabilities has been carried forward\u000d\u000a      into impact through translation of EOS technologies (methods and data)\u000d\u000a      into the private sector at both regional and national levels.

At its core, the basis to the research is the\u000d\u000a      use of Physics to fully determine spectroscopy and physical radiative\u000d\u000a      transfer in satellite remote sensing, to determine the information content\u000d\u000a      of the Earth Observation (EO) data from satellites, and to obtain ever\u000d\u000a      more accurate mathematical inversion of the data to geophysical\u000d\u000a      parameters. The consolidation of this research occurred in the last decade\u000d\u000a      when the outputs became particularly fruitful, and the group, led from\u000d\u000a      2002 by Professor John Remedios, expanded to approximately thirty strong.\u000d\u000a    In the early 2000s, Leicester EOS research resulted in a number of\u000d\u000a      breakthroughs best exemplified by papers in two distinct areas: 1) the\u000d\u000a      development of spectral inversion techniques which allow one to model the\u000d\u000a      satellite signal and then determine Earth atmosphere and surface\u000d\u000a      parameters (for example reference [1]); 2) new methods to look at the\u000d\u000a      accuracy of long-term, high quality data sets for (climate) change\u000d\u000a      detection [2]. This type of research is typical of recent EOS research\u000d\u000a      development of physically-based, state-of-the-art methods to derive,\u000d\u000a      mathematically, parameters from EO data in a robust manner, and to assess\u000d\u000a      their quality.\u000d\u000a    A very significant component of this research has been the extension of\u000d\u000a      conventional\" (but difficult) optimal algorithms, based on Bayes theory,\u000d\u000a      to challenging inversion problems such as highly ill-constrained problems,\u000d\u000a      multiple scattering situations and data sets requiring high accuracy\u000d\u000a      (better than 1%) such as greenhouse gases and cloud\/precipitation.\u000d\u000a      Reference [3] was amongst the first of a number of key papers in this area\u000d\u000a      from Dr. Michael Barkley, Dr. Roland Leigh, Professor John Remedios, and\u000d\u000a      other EOS academics at Leicester. This type of research has been\u000d\u000a      particularly important in enhancing our capability to determine new\u000d\u000a      parameters and change products (greenhouse gases [1], burnt area from\u000d\u000a      fires [5], algal production in lakes [6]).\u000d\u000a    Our research also identified areas in which scientific goals were closely\u000d\u000a      aligned with areas of societal interest for science: urban air quality\u000d\u000a      [4]; burnt area (important for deforestation and international REDD treaty\u000d\u000a      [5]); most recently, water quality and ecology [6].

In countering this risk, it was\u000a      seen as imperative to have bioaerosol detection systems capable of\u000a      providing a real-time warning of attack in sensitive or vulnerable areas\u000a      such as underground rail networks, shopping malls and airports.\u000a    Existing real-time military bioaerosol detection technology, developed\u000a      primarily for battlefields, was prohibitively expensive for widespread\u000a      deployment in urban civilian situations. Such technologies were\u000a      predominantly based on exploiting intrinsic particle fluorescence to\u000a      provide real-time discrimination between biological and non-biological\u000a      airborne particles in the ambient environment. A major part of the cost of\u000a      these systems came from the expensive solid-state UV lasers (typically\u000a      &#163;10,000-&#163;25,000 each) that were required to excite specific fluorophores,\u000a      such as tryptophan, present only within biological particles. Indeed,\u000a      since potential biological agent discrimination could be enhanced by using\u000a      more than one UV excitation wavelength, frequently two or more such lasers\u000a      were deployed.\u000a    In 2001, [text removed for publication] the US government launched its\u000a      [text removed for publication], five-year Semiconductor UltraViolet\u000a      Optical Sources (SUVOS) research programme, to seek the development of UV\u000a      diode lasers or LEDs of sufficient power to be used for bioaerosol\u000a      fluorescence detection. By its conclusion in 2006, SUVOS had resulted in\u000a      the realisation of both diode lasers and LEDs down to the sub-300nm\u000a      wavelengths required for tryptophan excitation; however, laser lifetimes\u000a      and output energy densities remained too low to excite detectable\u000a      fluorescence from targets as small as individual bacterial spores.\u000a    In parallel with the US SUVOS initiative, Professor Paul Kaye and\u000a      colleagues Edwin Hirst and Warren Stanley in the university's Centre for\u000a      Atmospheric and Instrumentation Research (CAIR) proposed in 2001 a radical\u000a      alternative approach to the low-cost fluorescence excitation of single\u000a      airborne biological particles - one based on the multi-UV-wavelength\u000a      excitation from compact xenon flashlamps, relatives of those found in\u000a      disposable camera `flash' units.\u000a    Professor Kaye's investigations were funded by Dstl (Defence Science\u000a      &amp; Technology Laboratory) via a series of awards from 2001 to 2007. The\u000a      research focused on overcoming the numerous technical challenges of using\u000a      xenon flashlamps. These included: substantial improvement in the\u000a      `blocking' of radiation from the flashlamps outside the desired UV\u000a      wavelength bands; design of compact high-efficiency optical systems both\u000a      to deliver the UV radiation to the particle and capture the resulting\u000a      fluorescence (this involved the use of custom-designed mirrors and\u000a      coatings); aerodynamic modelling of aerosol delivery systems to ensure\u000a      particles carried in the sample airflow were exposed individually to the\u000a      UV radiation; and optically quenching unwanted fluorescence from other\u000a      components within the instrument that threatened to dominate the\u000a      ultra-weak fluorescence from the particles. One by one, these challenges\u000a      were overcome, and the effectiveness of using xenon sources to achieve\u000a      real-time discrimination of airborne biological particles was demonstrated\u000a      in major field trials in both the UK and the US. These findings were\u000a      disseminated via presentation at major international defence conferences\u000a      and publication in refereed journals, and formed the basis of\u000a      international patents (see Section 3).\u000a    The resulting technology developed at the university was initially named\u000a      the Wide Issue Bioaerosol Sensor (WIBS) (modified to `Waveband Integrated\u000a      Bioaerosol Sensor' in civilian application fields) to reflect its\u000a      potential for deployment in networks of sensors throughout areas\u000a      vulnerable to bio-terrorism.

Lasers provided an ideal\u000d\u000a      method of illuminating whole suspensions of airborne or liquid-borne\u000d\u000a      particles, with the resulting scattered light distributions being analysed\u000d\u000a      at various scattering angles to determine key properties of the\u000d\u000a      suspension. In comparison, the use of lasers for single particle analysis\u000d\u000a      was generally restricted to simply particle counting and sizing.\u000d\u000a    The manner in which a single particle scatters light is dependent not\u000d\u000a      only on its size but also on its shape and internal structure (as well as\u000d\u000a      the wavelength and polarisation of the incident illumination and the\u000d\u000a      medium supporting the particle). The potential existed therefore to use\u000d\u000a      the pattern of light scattered by a particle as a `thumbprint' by which\u000d\u000a      the particle could be characterised, classified and even identified.\u000d\u000a      However, it was only in the early 1990s that the high-sensitivity,\u000d\u000a      high-resolution, optical detectors and low-cost computer processing power\u000d\u000a      required to investigate this potential became readily available. This\u000d\u000a      challenge was taken up in the mid-1990s by the Particle Instruments\u000d\u000a      Research Group, part of the university's Centre for Atmospheric and\u000d\u000a      Instrumentation Research (CAIR) and has since led to technologies that\u000d\u000a      have been adopted by commercial companies and research organisations\u000d\u000a      worldwide (see Section 4).\u000d\u000a    The group, led by Professor Paul Kaye and including a team of\u000d\u000a      postdoctoral research assistants, among them Edwin Hirst (now a staff\u000d\u000a      member and active researcher), undertook their fundamental research into spatial\u000a        light scattering (SLS) under sponsorship from the EPSRC, NERC,\u000d\u000a      Leverhulme Trust, and industry (see Section 3). This resulted in the first\u000d\u000a      publications in the field that fully highlighted the potential of the new\u000d\u000a      technology (see, for example, Section 3, References 1-3) as well as\u000d\u000a      several international patents later assigned to commercial and\u000d\u000a      governmental third parties under royalty-sharing agreements.\u000d\u000a    The research itself comprised two major strands: the development of instrument\u000a        systems that exploited optoelectronic and computing advances of the\u000d\u000a      time to allow the real-time capture of particle light scattering data, and\u000d\u000a      the development of theoretical models and algorithms to interpret\u000d\u000a      these data and allow the necessary particle\u000d\u000a      characterisation\/identification. This theoretical work, largely undertaken\u000d\u000a      by researchers Joseph Ulanowski and Evelyn Hesse, encompassed both direct\u000d\u000a      and inverse scattering problems (the former being the computation of\u000d\u000a      particle scattering from the knowledge of particle properties; the latter,\u000d\u000a      the extraction of particle parameters such as size, shape and refractive\u000d\u000a      index from scattering data). This research has since developed into the\u000d\u000a      Light Scattering and Radiative Properties Research Group, a significant\u000d\u000a      and active research area within CAIR.\u000d\u000a    Since the initial fundamental research into theoretical and empirical\u000d\u000a      particle light scattering phenomena, the development of our research has\u000d\u000a      been heavily influenced by meeting specific needs of end-user communities\u000d\u000a      who required instrumentation to allow the non-destructive real-time\u000d\u000a      detection and identification of various particle types. Application areas\u000d\u000a      have included the detection of aerosolised warfare agents; the in situ\u000d\u000a      measurement and characterisation of cloud particles such as droplets, ice\u000d\u000a      crystals and solid aerosol that profoundly influence cloud radiative\u000d\u000a      properties and ultimately global climate; the characterisation of\u000d\u000a      incinerator smoke-stack emissions; the real-time monitoring of\u000d\u000a      occupational aerosols associated with, for example, mining and `sick\u000d\u000a      buildings'; clean-room monitoring; water quality monitoring; and, most\u000d\u000a      recently, the detection of potentially lethal airborne asbestos fibres.\u000d\u000a      Each application area has required the development of new research\u000d\u000a      methodologies and techniques to achieve the desired aims (see Section 4).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44477","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In April 2010, just four days after the northern European airspace was\u000a      closed in the wake of the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull eruption, Hertfordshire's\u000a      unique radiosondes, built to count and size atmospheric aerosols, were\u000a      used to validate Met Office models that forecast the amount and trajectory\u000a      of the volcanic ash. There had been substantial pressure from the airlines\u000a      and others to keep the skies open, but these first in situ measurements of\u000a      the ash justified the authorities' decision to ground flights and avoid\u000a      the potential risk to air passengers' lives.\u000a    The atmospheric ash from the 2010 eruption caused massive disruption to\u000a      transatlantic and European air traffic. This had a significant economic\u000a      impact on the air industry: almost 100,000 flights were cancelled and\u000a      airlines had to compensate passengers for delays. The total impact on\u000a      global GDP caused by the first week's disruption was estimated at $4.7\u000a      billion, and each additional day was costing European economies several\u000a      hundred million dollars. There were also considerable concerns about\u000a      disruptions to military air traffic, including supply, Medivac,\u000a      repatriation and training flights linked to the Afghanistan conflict\u000a      (Section 5, Refs 5.1-5.5).\u000a    Evidence already existed that aircraft were in considerable danger if\u000a      they flew through volcanic ash, even at sub-visible concentrations,\u000a      because of the engine damage that could result. For example, in June 1982,\u000a      the Boeing 747 London to Auckland flight BA263 encountered an ash plume\u000a      from the erupting Mount Galunggung in Java, resulting in all four engines\u000a      failing. The plane managed to glide sufficiently out of the ash plume for\u000a      three of the four engines to restart. Despite awareness of such evidence,\u000a      airlines affected by Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull queried the restrictions imposed on\u000a      them, claiming that test flights through the so-called `red zones' showed\u000a      no evidence of any damage. This presented the authorities with a huge\u000a      problem &#8212; namely, that identifying the prohibited air-space (red zones)\u000a      relied on theoretical Met Office ash dispersion models that were unproven\u000a      and therefore being brought into question. The only solution was to\u000a      acquire in situ measurements of the ash clouds, but aircraft that would\u000a      normally be used for atmospheric cloud particle studies, including the Met\u000a      Office's FAAM instrumented research aircraft, were also grounded by the\u000a      flight ban: a Catch-22 situation.\u000a    Fortunately, despite being developed for another purpose &#8212; i.e. the\u000a      characterisation of atmospheric dust and its vertical profile (in turn\u000a      following up the discovery of dust alignment during astronomical\u000a      observations) &#8212; the radiosondes built by the university's researchers and\u000a      described in section 2 were capable of characterising volcanic ash. The\u000a      University of Hertfordshire led the NERC-funded radiosonde project and\u000a      developed the aerosol counters; the University of Reading developed the\u000a      electric charge sensors subsequently establishing that the ash particles\u000a      carried a charge. As they were unaffected by the flight ban, the\u000a      radiosondes could offer the most direct, quantitative and real-time data\u000a      about the extent of the ash plumes, including the ash density and particle\u000a      sizing. The Met Office was aware of the radiosondes through previous\u000a      research collaborations with CAIR and, given the urgency of the situation,\u000a      the fact that the sondes required no modification for ash measurements was\u000a      extremely important.\u000a    This was how the first ever measurements of the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull volcanic\u000a      ash came to be conducted using Hertfordshire radiosondes, at the request\u000a      of the Met Office, by balloon launch in Scotland. The measurements were\u000a      used to validate the models and justify the caution employed by the\u000a      authorities, thereby preventing potential widespread aircraft damage or\u000a      potential catastrophic failure had they capitulated to considerable\u000a      commercial pressure and reopened the airspace prematurely. These\u000a      radiosonde data were discussed during sessions of COBRA, the Cabinet\u000a      Office emergency briefing forum, and special parliamentary committee\u000a      meetings. They were also widely publicised in the media, including\u000a      national radio (Refs 5.6-5.8).\u000a    The Met Office provided CAIR with an interim contract to build a further\u000a      twenty `reserve' radiosondes for use in further volcanic ash episodes.\u000a      CAIR is also developing a version of the radiosondes that can be dropped\u000a      from aircraft able to fly above the ash cloud layer. Further, a one-year\u000a      NERC grant (&#163;99,000) has been secured for a project that will run\u000a      throughout 2014 and lead to commercialisation of the sonde system for\u000a      measuring volcanic ash and other atmospheric aerosols.\u000a    The wider commercial opportunities of the `low-cost' particle detection\u000a      technologies born out of the radiosonde development has also been\u000a      recognised. These technologies, the subject of international patenting,\u000a      have been licensed to UK company Alphasense Ltd, for worldwide\u000a      exploitation in areas of environmental monitoring, air quality and\u000a      industrial safety. The licence guarantees minimum royalty payments [text\u000a      removed for publication] over the first four years.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Measurements made by unique radiosondes, conceived at and built by the\u000a      university to count and size atmospheric aerosols, were used to validate\u000a      UK Met Office models that forecast the amount and trajectory of the\u000a      volcanic ash from the 2010 Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull eruption.

Facility\u000a      instruments and private instruments were used at major observatories &#8212; the\u000a      Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT), Australia; United Kingdom Infrared\u000a      Telescope (UKIRT), Hawaii; and the William Herschel Telescope (WHT), La\u000a      Palma, Canary Islands.\u000a    A grant from the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (now the\u000a      Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)) supported the design and\u000a      construction of a private polarimeter (PlanetPol) (Section 3, Ref. 1),\u000a      commissioned in 2005, to detect the reflected (polarised) light from\u000a      exoplanets &#8212; planets that orbit stars other than the Sun. This work was\u000a      carried out by Professor James Hough (Director, Astronomy Research to\u000a      2010, now Research Professor) in collaboration with Dr Phil Lucas\u000a      (Reader), and Dr Edwin Hirst (Senior Research Fellow). PlanetPol has a\u000a      fractional polarisation sensitivity of 1 part per million, by far the\u000a      highest ever achieved for a polarimeter used on a telescope.\u000a    During one set of astronomical observations (May 2005 on the WHT), some\u000a      of the normally unpolarised standard stars were observed to have\u000a      polarisations an order of magnitude larger than previously observed (Ref.\u000a      2). It became apparent that this coincided with a Saharan dust storm\u000a      extending over the Canary Islands. Detailed calculations (Ref. 3) showed\u000a      that the polarisation was produced by dichroic absorption in the dust\u000a      layer over the islands resulting from the generally ellipsoidal dust\u000a      grains being oriented vertically by the presence of electric fields (1-2\u000a      kVm-1), with the field most likely generated by the presence of\u000a      electrical charging of the dust itself.\u000a    That desert dust can be aligned by electric fields, an effect not\u000a      hitherto observed, has implications for atmospheric models (and hence\u000a      climate modelling), and for the accurate retrieval of data from sun\u000a      photometers and from satellite observations. The STFC, recognising that an\u000a      astronomy research project they had funded could have an impact on climate\u000a      modelling, issued a news release to that effect.\u000a    2) The Centre for Atmospheric and Instrumentation Research (CAIR)\u000a      specialises in the development of techniques and instruments for the\u000a      detection, monitoring, characterisation, and analysis of airborne\u000a      particulates in atmospheric, environmental, and security fields. Sponsors\u000a      include EPSRC, NERC, dstl, the EU, NASA, NSF, NCAR, the Institute of\u000a      Meteorology and Climate Research, Germany, and commercial companies in the\u000a      UK, USA, and Europe. CAIR staff are named inventors on worldwide patents\u000a      for particle monitoring and characterisation systems, and numerous\u000a      commercial particle monitoring instrument systems have arisen from these.\u000a    Our theoretical work encompasses both direct and inverse scattering\u000a      problems (i.e., computation of scattering from the knowledge of particle\u000a      properties, and extraction of particle parameters such as size, shape and\u000a      refractive index from scattering data, respectively) for particles of\u000a      various geometries.\u000a    Following the discovery of the aligned dust grain phenomenon, NERC funded\u000a      our development of the world's first low-cost atmospheric `radiosondes'.\u000a      These laser-optical devices attach to meteorological balloons and achieve\u000a      in situ counting and sizing of individual atmospheric particles (Ref. 4).\u000a      This work was led by Dr Zbigniew Ulanowski (Reader), and Dr Edwin Hirst.\u000a      The probes were first used during a 2009 NERC-funded field campaign for\u000a      taking airborne desert dust measurements in the Middle East (Ref. 5) and\u000a      on Cape Verde Islands prior to the eruption of Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44478","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Centre for Astrophysics Research encourages its lecturers and\u000a      researchers to develop public engagement skills through delivering talks,\u000a      supporting national astronomy-related magazines, and assisting at events\u000a      such as the Open Evenings held at the university's Bayfordbury\u000a      Observatory, which receives around 4,000 visitors each year.\u000a    The Observatory's programme of inspiring public interest in astronomy\u000a      began in the late 1970s. Starting with a single 0.5m telescope, it now has\u000a      seven domed telescopes, typical aperture 0.4m, a 4.5m radio dish and a\u000a      three-dish interferometer. The recent automation of five of the seven\u000a      optical telescopes, providing remote control over the Internet and\u000a      queue-scheduled observing, permits increasingly efficient use of the\u000a      telescopes and people's time, thereby continuing to nurture practical\u000a      astronomy in the UK. Observations include some of the extra-solar planet\u000a      candidates from Rocky Planets around Cool Stars (RoPACs), the\u000a      Hertfordshire-led, &#8364;3.2m EU-funded Marie Curie Initial Training Network,\u000a      and RoPACS has led to a significant stake in the European Space Agency's\u000a      potential exoplanet mission Echo, whose likely target list is also being\u000a      monitored at Bayfordbury. In public engagement terms, such observations\u000a      emphasise that Bayfordbury is a working observatory to which the public\u000a      have access, increasing its attraction for visitors.\u000a    There are six Open Evenings a year. There is a small charge (&#163;4 adults;\u000a      &#163;2 concessions) and they are always oversubscribed, with 400 first-time\u000a      and repeat visitors aged 5-70+ at each event. Each evening is supported by\u000a      about 20 lecturers, researchers and research students, and is centred\u000a      around a single theme chosen from one of CAR's research strengths, with\u000a      talks given by one or more staff actively involved in the research.\u000a      Examples are: exoplanets, brown dwarfs, life on other planets, radio\u000a      astronomy, planetary nebulae, and supermassive black holes.\u000a    Visitors can also use the telescopes. All optical telescopes have CCD\u000a      cameras, some with lucky-imaging to improve image quality - but on Open\u000a      Evenings eye-pieces are often used: seeing images with `your own eyes'\u000a      offers visitors direct, personal enjoyment of the night sky. Even on\u000a      cloudy evenings people visit the domes, and a researcher is stationed in\u000a      each one to explain the facilities and the nature of the objects viewed.\u000a      The radio telescopes are controlled from the adjacent Patrick Moore\u000a      building, where a talk on radio astronomy is repeated several times.\u000a    The Science Learning Centre, the national astronomy specialist centre\u000a      next to the Observatory, is thrown open during open evenings, allowing\u000a      access to a lecture theatre, small planetarium, computer suite,\u000a      laboratories and cafe. Several activities are held there, including talks,\u000a      planetarium shows, using the web to access astronomy databases and images,\u000a      and hands-on demonstrations, many of them child-centred. For example,\u000a      Artist-in-Residence Reggie Valkenborgh was inspired by our work to use a\u000a      pinhole camera, made from a drinks can, to take images of the sky above\u000a      the Observatory, with a six-month time exposure. She explained her\u000a      technique at open evenings and provided material for children to try it\u000a      themselves. One of her images was chosen as NASA's Astronomy Picture of\u000a      the Day in 2012, which generated local and national interest. (Section 5,\u000a      References 1-3)\u000a    \u000a     \u000a     \u000a     Visitors remark on the knowledge and enthusiasm of the staff, and how\u000a      this makes their visit `enjoyable', `interesting', `informative', `varied'\u000a      and `excellent'. Feedback forms from just one Open Night reveal visitors\u000a      inspired to buy a telescope, consider studying physics at university, join\u000a      an astronomy society, or `look at the stars with family and friend in the\u000a      garden'. Some people leave 5* comments on Tripadvisor, do blog writeups,\u000a      or send appreciative letters. One blogger said that her son had been\u000a      `inspired . . . to find out more and now he is talking about wanting to\u000a      become a scientist!' (Refs 4-7)\u000a    The Observatory hosts about 50 group visits annually, including private\u000a      parties, brownie and scout troops, and schools. The programme is similar\u000a      to the open evenings, and feedback is good. For example: `I have heard\u000a      some very positive accounts this morning and it seems to have been a very\u000a      popular, enjoyable and informative visit for all concerned. Given the\u000a      popularity of the visit and the wonderful show case that it is for UH . .\u000a      . it would be excellent if we could arrange a trip every semester.' (Ref.\u000a      4)\u000a    At the Science Learning Centre, CAR staff run a wide-ranging presentation\u000a      for around 20 schoolteachers annually. This `cutting-edge' course\u000a      (`Astrophysics', originally `From Hydrogen to Humans') is supported by a\u000a      &#163;60,000 RCUK grant and is often run in twilight hours, giving teachers the\u000a      opportunity to use the telescopes. Although pioneered and still led\u000a      locally, it is now offered at other centres. The course is also offered\u000a      annually to around 30 teachers as part of a Subject Knowledge Enhancement\u000a      course (SKE) for teachers whose initial training was not in physics. As\u000a      the RCUK requires its cutting-edge courses to be continually updated and\u000a      to involve Council- funded researchers, CAR staff use this opportunity to\u000a      present their research within a broader context than the narrowly\u000a      academic. Participant feedback is encouraging: teachers report a `much\u000a      improved knowledge of the Big Bang and exoplanets', or a `better\u000a      understanding of the formation of the universe'. Importantly, course\u000a      content is shared with school colleagues, so that newly learned tools and\u000a      techniques are `filtering down to the other teachers of physics'.\u000a      Participants also feel that `more confidence and enthusiasm for\u000a      Astrophysics from me means [my] students are more motivated', and that\u000a      their students are `stimulated to find out more for themselves'.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The university's Bayfordbury Observatory is a working observatory that\u000a      engages with the public via six Open Evenings and approximately 50 group\u000a      visits a year, offering access to a wide range of facilities. Many of the\u000a      4,000 visitors annually report that they develop a first or renewed\u000a      `enthusiasm for astronomy', or become `inspired to learn more' about what\u000a      they have seen or heard from our researchers; some young people enthuse\u000a      about `now wanting to be a scientist'.

Inter alia, CAR staff lead several\u000a      very large-scale international surveys: exoplanets on UKIRT, the\u000a      Magellanic Clouds on the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope Chile\u000a      (VISTA), the Milky Way on the Isaac Newton Telescope La Palma and the VLT\u000a      Survey Telescope (VST) Chile. For more targeted observations, CAR\u000a      astronomers make extensive use of major ground-based and space\u000a      observatories covering wavelengths from radio to X-ray. Imaging,\u000a      photometry, spectroscopy, polarimetry and radio interferometry are all\u000a      techniques regularly deployed by CAR staff.\u000a    The range and strength of astronomy research is of great benefit in\u000a      public engagement programmes, as expertise can be provided that covers\u000a      most of contemporary astronomy, the latest discoveries, and the many\u000a      techniques used.\u000a    Two examples of the many research projects undertaken since 1993 are:\u000a    (i) Using the polarimeters developed by CAR for the AAT and UKIRT\u000a      infrared imagers, the first circular polarisation images of the Orion\u000a      star-forming complex unexpectedly showed very high degrees of circular\u000a      polarisation; detailed modelling was then able to explain how this was\u000a      being produced. This discovery led to a possible explanation for one of\u000a      the long-standing problems in the development of life on Earth, namely the\u000a      origin of homochirality which occurs for all Earth life-forms. It was\u000a      proposed that the highly polarised circular polarisation produces, through\u000a      asymmetric photolysis, an enantiomeric excess in prebiotic material, and\u000a      this is delivered to Earth during its heavy bombardment phase. This\u000a      raised, and continues to raise, considerable interest in the scientific\u000a      community and at many public talks. Laboratory follow-up to determine\u000a      whether homochirality could be used as a universal biomarker has been\u000a      carried out in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards\u000a      &amp; Technology (NIST) and the Space Telescope Science Institute\u000a      (Baltimore, USA), and at CAR.\u000a    (ii) CAR's high-energy astrophysics research includes the study of\u000a      relativistic jets from compact objects such as black holes and neutron\u000a      stars, particularly focusing on particle acceleration and the large-scale\u000a      dynamics of the jets and the shocks that they drive through the external\u000a      medium. Observational work spans all wavelengths from the gamma-ray and\u000a      X-ray (Fermi, Chandra, XMM-Newton) to the radio (JVLA, LOFAR), while\u000a      theoretical work involves both analytic studies and numerical simulations\u000a      using CAR's powerful computer facilities. The recent proposal that the\u000a      ultra-high-energy cosmic rays mapped by the Pierre Auger Observatory can\u000a      be generated in the giant lobes of Centaurus A and other radio galaxies\u000a      has been influential in both the cosmic ray and active galaxy communities.\u000a      In public talks, a direct link is there to be made between phenomena\u000a      easily observable, even in school laboratories (cosmic rays) and cutting-\u000a      edge research on powerful, cosmically-distant radio galaxies.\u000a    "}]

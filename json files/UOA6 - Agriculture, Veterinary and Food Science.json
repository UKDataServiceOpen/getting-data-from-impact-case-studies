As such,\u000d\u000a      regulation affects the agricultural and horticultural industries,\u000d\u000a      companies wishing to commercialise biopesticide products and also food\u000d\u000a      retailers that are pressing their suppliers to grow fresh produce free of\u000d\u000a      pesticide residues. The Warwick research has led to improvements in the UK\u000d\u000a      regulatory system for biopesticides which is important for facilitating\u000d\u000a      more product approvalsA. Since the Warwick research was started\u000d\u000a      and the new UK PSD biopesticides scheme was introduced, there has been a\u000d\u000a      430% increase in the number of biopesticide products approved in the UK\u000d\u000a      (see below). The Warwick research has had a direct impact on the UK\u000d\u000a      government regulatorB, decision-makers in the European\u000d\u000a      Commission and European ParliamentC, biopesticide manufacturers\u000d\u000a      and crop growersD-F.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on the regulation of biopesticides:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aUK regulatory policy: A significant impact has been to help\u000d\u000a        facilitate the implementation of a new regulatory system for\u000d\u000a        biopesticides in the UK. The team provided training to the government\u000d\u000a        regulator on biological control science and regulatory innovation, held\u000d\u000a        workshops with government bodies, the biopesticides industry, growers,\u000d\u000a        retailers and others, and proposed for a set of principles to underpin\u000d\u000a        the new biopesticides regulatory system that came into effect in 2006\u000d\u000a        (enacted by the PSD, now the CRD). This has been widely recognised by\u000d\u000a        PSD and the biopesticide industry as being of importance to the crop\u000d\u000a        protection industryA-G. For example, Richard Davis, the then\u000d\u000a        Director of Approvals at CRD, has stated \"Biopesticides have presented a\u000d\u000a        fantastic challenge to both regulators and those developing alternative\u000d\u000a        control measures, working with the RELU team has helped people over that\u000d\u000a        hurdle\"B.\u000d\u000a      European policy advice: Dr. Chandler was invited by the Agriculture\u000d\u000a        and Rural Development Committee of the European Parliament to advise on\u000d\u000a        the potential of biopesticides and other alternative crop protection\u000d\u000a        agents within the context of new European legislation on chemical\u000d\u000a        pesticide use being developed at that time (Directive 2009\/128\/EC). Dr.\u000d\u000a        Chandler and Prof. Grant gave a lecture at the Parliament (December\u000d\u000a        2008) and Dr. Chandler was lead author on a detailed policy guidance\u000d\u000a        documentC. The report recommended increasing the use of\u000d\u000a        biopesticides and other alternative crop protection products in the EU\u000d\u000a        and gave guidance on innovations for the regulatory system for crop\u000d\u000a        protection agents. New EU crop protection legislation (Directive\u000d\u000a        2009\/128\/EC, Sustainable Use of Pesticides) was enacted in 2009 which\u000d\u000a        states that biopesticides and other alternative agents must be used in\u000d\u000a        preference to conventional chemical pesticides where they provide\u000d\u000a        satisfactory levels of control.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a      Impacts on commerce:\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a \u000aUK &amp; EU biopesticides industry. The number of biopesticide\u000d\u000a        products registered for use in the UK has increased significantlyA.\u000d\u000a        Prior to the new UK PSD Biopesticides Regulation Scheme, only six\u000d\u000a        biopesticides were approved. Today, there are 26 registered\u000d\u000a        biopesticides in the UK. In the EU the number of registered biopesticide\u000d\u000a        active substances is also increasing, and has gone from 42 in 2008 to\u000d\u000a        around 100 in 2013D. The EU biopesticides market is growing\u000d\u000a        at 16% p.a. compared to 3% for conventional pesticidesD and\u000d\u000a        in 2010 was estimated at &#8364;40M.\u000d\u000a      \u000aUK retailers and growers. Presentations on IPM, biopesticides\u000d\u000a        and biopesticide regulation were given to Sainsbury's. Dr. Chandler\u000d\u000a        became an invited lecturer on biopesticides for the Waitrose Responsible\u000d\u000a        Agronomy Course (2008 &amp; 2010) which is mandatory for its suppliers\u000d\u000a        (this includes growers, technical managers, and fresh produce sales and\u000d\u000a        purchasing staff). In his lectures, Dr. Chandler teaches about the use\u000d\u000a        of biopesticides in IPM and options for improving the sustainability of\u000d\u000a        crop protection. Interviews with Marks and Spencer done in the Warwick\u000d\u000a        RELU biopesticides project led to M&amp;S having follow-up meetings with\u000d\u000a        researchers on biological pest controls, helping to inform their\u000d\u000a        pesticide strategyB.\u000d\u000a      \u000aRecognition of commercial impact by Defra: The Defra Science\u000d\u000a        Advisory Council recognised the value of the project in a report\u000d\u000a        published in 2007G. The report stated that the research \"has\u000d\u000a        succeeded in opening up a new dialogue among a range of stakeholders\u000d\u000a        from regulators through manufacturers, consultants and retailers to\u000d\u000a        growers, and is helping to prime the emergence of a new industrial\u000d\u000a        sector around bio-pesticides\".\u000d\u000a      \u000aHelping shape the biopesticides sector: In 2011 Dr. Chandler\u000d\u000a        acted as consultant for a biopesticides industry conference organised in\u000d\u000a        Amsterdam by Informa (a global academic publisher and information\u000d\u000a        business). The meeting was significant in being the first industry\u000d\u000a        conference of its size (100 delegates) to be attended by senior\u000d\u000a        representatives of global agri- businesses (Syngenta, Bayer, BASF and\u000d\u000a        Monsanto) and the biopesticides industry. Dr. Chandler and Professor\u000d\u000a        Grant gave lectures based on the findings of their research on the\u000d\u000a        regulation and use of biopesticides. In addition, Dr. Chandler\u000d\u000a        co-managed a pre-conference workshop on the science behind biopesticides\u000d\u000a        and IPM. The meeting provided an opportunity for agrochemical and\u000d\u000a        biopesticide industries to discuss areas of common interest,\u000d\u000a        particularly with respect to IPM. From 2012 there has been significant\u000d\u000a        new investment in the biopesticide industry with at least 22 corporate\u000d\u000a        deals for biopesticides globallyD.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a      Recognition by the Research Councils:\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a \u000aBBSRC impact case study: The research was featured on the BBSRC\u000d\u000a        website (2012 - present) as an example of scientific excellence with\u000d\u000a        impactH.\u000d\u000a      \u000aRCUK: An independent report for RCUK in 2012 on the UK societal\u000d\u000a        and economic impact of the RELU programme concluded that RELU research\u000d\u000a        has helped change policies and practices concerning the rural economy,\u000d\u000a        and cites the biopesticides research at Warwick as an exampleI.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This research represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between the\u000d\u000a      School of Life Sciences and the Department of Politics and International\u000d\u000a      Studies at the University of Warwick. The research focused on the\u000d\u000a      commercialisation of biological pesticides or \"biopesticides\" - pest\u000d\u000a      control agents from natural sources that are considered safer for humans\u000d\u000a      and the environment than most conventional chemical pesticides and could\u000d\u000a      potentially substitute for synthetic chemical pesticides. Biopesticide\u000d\u000a      products can only be sold if they have been authorised by government\u000d\u000a      regulators under UK and EU legislation. Prior to this research, only six\u000d\u000a      biopesticide products had been commercialised in the UK. The research\u000d\u000a      identified shortcomings in the UK biopesticide regulatory process and its\u000d\u000a      associated policy network that acted as unnecessary barriers to the\u000d\u000a      authorisation of biopesticides. A set of recommendations for an improved\u000d\u000a      regulatory system was developed. The UK Pesticides Safety Directorate used\u000d\u000a      the research to help implement a new scheme to facilitate the registration\u000d\u000a      of biopesticides in the UK and therefore get more products to the market.\u000d\u000a      The research was also used in 2008 to provide policy advice to the\u000d\u000a      European Parliament on making greater use of biopesticides and other\u000d\u000a      alternatives to synthetic chemical pesticides and improving the way they\u000d\u000a      are regulated.

Traditionally,\u000d\u000a      pests have been managed using synthetic chemical pesticides (e.g.\u000d\u000a      organophosphates, carbamates, synthetic pyrethroids). However, excessive\u000d\u000a      pesticide use can damage the environment, for example by harming\u000d\u000a      non-target organisms, and lead to pest control failure through the\u000d\u000a      development of resistance in pests that can be inherited from one\u000d\u000a      generation to the next (e.g. see Pimentel, Environment, Development &amp;\u000d\u000a      Sustainability, 7, 229 - 252 (2005). Concerns have also been expressed\u000d\u000a      about the safety of pesticide residues in food. In response, the European\u000d\u000a      Commission has brought in legislation on pesticide approvals that is\u000d\u000a      reducing the numbers of synthetic chemical pesticides authorized in the EU\u000d\u000a      (Regulation EC 1107\/2009).\u000d\u000a    Promising alternatives to conventional pesticides are \"biopesticides\".\u000d\u000a      These are pest control agents from natural sources including\u000d\u000a      microorganisms, plant compounds and insect pheromones. They are intended\u000d\u000a      for use in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programmes, which aim to grow\u000d\u000a      healthy crops with the least possible disruption to ecosystems, and with a\u000d\u000a      reduced reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. Biopesticides offer\u000d\u000a      several benefits, primarily in terms of being safer for humans and the\u000d\u000a      environment1. However, the rate of commercialisation of\u000d\u000a      biopesticides in the UK and mainland Europe has been slow compared to that\u000d\u000a      in other countries, for example, in 2011 there were three times as many\u000d\u000a      biopesticide products authorized for use in the USA compared to the EU1.\u000d\u000a      We hypothesised that one reason for this delay was the government approval\u000d\u000a      process required in the UK and Europe before biopesticides can be sold to\u000d\u000a      farmers and growers. The approvals process requires the biopesticide\u000d\u000a      company to submit a dossier on the efficacy and safety of the candidate\u000d\u000a      biopesticide product. At the time the Warwick research began (2004),\u000d\u000a      dossier assessment and product authorisation was handled in the UK by a\u000d\u000a      government regulator (the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD)), and an\u000d\u000a      independent body (the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP)). This was\u000d\u000a      done under the auspices of EU regulations (Directive 91\/414EEC).\u000d\u000a    The problem of poor commercialisation of biopesticides was originally\u000d\u000a      discussed at a workshop (2003) organised by Dr. David Chandler (an expert\u000d\u000a      in microbial biopesticides, then working at the Horticultural Research\u000d\u000a      International Institute (HRI) which merged with the University of Warwick\u000d\u000a      in 2005) for UK crop protection companies, growers and crop management\u000d\u000a      consultants (HRI Association meeting \"Biopesticides - the future?\",\u000d\u000a      Warwick, November 2003). A collaboration was formed in 2004 between crop\u000d\u000a      protection researchers (Dr. Chandler and Prof. Mark Tatchell, an expert in\u000d\u000a      IPM, also at HRI) and Prof. Wyn Grant, a political scientist (Warwick\u000d\u000a      University's Department of Politics and International Studies). This\u000d\u000a      collaboration led to a project (2004-2007) commissioned by the Research\u000d\u000a      Councils UK (RCUK) Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme to\u000d\u000a      investigate whether the UK regulatory process for biopesticides was acting\u000d\u000a      as a barrier to their commercialisation. The activities in this Warwick\u000d\u000a      RELU project were as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Interviews were held during the Warwick RELU biopesticides project\u000d\u000a        with crop growers, biopesticide manufacturers, consultants and\u000d\u000a        biopesticide retailers. The team closely observed the workings of the\u000d\u000a        PSD and in 2007 Dr. Chandler became the first \"outsider\" to observe a\u000d\u000a        meeting of the ACP, which meets in closed session. Biopesticide\u000d\u000a        regulators in the USA, the Netherlands and Denmark were also interviewed\u000d\u000a        to compare the regulatory systems in these countries with the UK.\u000d\u000a      The Warwick research analysed the existing biopesticide regulatory\u000d\u000a        system and showed that it was unintentionally impeding the successful\u000d\u000a        registration of biopesticides in the UK or EU. The following\u000d\u000a        shortcomings of the model were identified: The risk assessment dossier\u000d\u000a        required by PSD was originally designed for conventional chemical\u000d\u000a        pesticides, and the information required was often not relevant to\u000d\u000a        biological control agents and was expensive for biopesticide companies\u000d\u000a        (many of which are SMEs) to produce, acting as a major deterrent to\u000d\u000a        commercialisation. In addition, there was a lack of knowledge of the\u000d\u000a        science of biopesticides and biological control within PSD and ACP,\u000d\u000a        including a lack of information on the biology and genetics of\u000d\u000a        microorganisms used in biopesticides, which caused delays in approvals\u000d\u000a        (in contrast the US regulator had a specialist biopesticide division and\u000d\u000a        was providing financial assistance to SME biopesticide companies). There\u000d\u000a        was also a need for a better understanding of the regulatory process by\u000d\u000a        biopesticide companies. These issues were adversely affecting product\u000d\u000a        risk assessment and highlighted the need for better dialogue between PSD\u000d\u000a        and biopesticide companies. The situation was made worse by economic\u000d\u000a        barriers to biopesticide adoption including the costs for crop growers\u000d\u000a        of switching from a single, conventional pesticide to a portfolio of\u000d\u000a        alternatives including biopesticides in an IPM programme1.\u000d\u000a      The Warwick RELU biopesticides research formed the basis of a set of\u000d\u000a        design principles for an improved system that was used to help implement\u000d\u000a        a new UK Biopesticides Regulation Scheme by PSD in 20071-3.\u000d\u000a        The research team brought together biopesticide manufacturers,\u000d\u000a        regulators, growers of horticultural crops and supermarket retailers\u000d\u000a        into a policy network.\u000d\u000aAn investigation was undertaken, as part of the\u000d\u000a        Warwick RELU biopesticides project, of the population genetics of fungal\u000d\u000a        species used in microbial biopesticides, information which is important\u000d\u000a        for environmental risk assessments of microbial biopesticides carried\u000d\u000a        out by the government regulators4,5.\u000d\u000a      The Warwick RELU biopesticides team worked as a close unit, with Dr.\u000d\u000a        Chandler providing expertise on biopesticides, Prof. Tatchell on IPM and\u000d\u000a        Prof. Grant on regulatory policy. This gave the group credibility with a\u000d\u000a        wide range of stakeholders.\u000d\u000a      Other research projects, led by Dr Chandler and funded by Defra and\u000d\u000a        industry, have explored the use of biopesticides in IPM systems.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a      Key researchers:\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a David Chandler, Senior Research Fellow, School of Life Sciences\u000d\u000a        (appointed 1990).

By 2011, the median flock\u000d\u000a      prevalence of lameness in England was 5% (interquartile range 2-10%) and\u000d\u000a      25% of farmers were using PAT, according to 445 farmers randomly sampled\u000d\u000a      from EBLEX8. Most recently, results from 1,200 farmers randomly\u000d\u000a      selected from all English sheep farmers gave a median estimated lameness\u000d\u000a      in 2012 of 3% (unpublished data, Green et al., available upon\u000d\u000a      request).\u000d\u000a    Adoption of practice in the GB sheep industry: In 2010, Professor\u000d\u000a      Green was asked to present evidence on managing lameness in sheep to the\u000d\u000a      UK Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC). Their \"Opinion on Lameness in\u000d\u000a      Sheep\" was published in 2011 with the recommendation that the prevalence\u000d\u000a      of lameness should be reduced from the current 10% to 5% by 2016 and to 2%\u000d\u000a      by 2021 using existing knowledge from our research (source A). The Opinion\u000d\u000a      is accessed at a rate of about 300 downloads per month (information can be\u000d\u000a      corroborated by email). Several retailers and quality assurance schemes\u000d\u000a      that are strongly influenced by the FAWC are now monitoring lameness and\u000d\u000a      provide advice to farmers on the appropriate treatment of lame sheep based\u000d\u000a      on the evidence from our research1-8.\u000d\u000a    Veterinary practitioners and consultants - Nationally and\u000d\u000a        Internationally: The results from this research have been presented\u000d\u000a      at Sheep Veterinary Society (SVS) meetings and published in SVS\u000d\u000a      proceedings. They have also been published in veterinary professional\u000d\u000a      journals such as UK Vet (Source B), where leading practitioners discuss\u000d\u000a      novel approaches to management, treatment and engaging with farmers and\u000d\u000a      also presented at other professional conferences, raising vets' awareness\u000d\u000a      of our findings.\u000d\u000a    The Warwick research has created a sea change in understanding how to\u000d\u000a      control FR both in the UK and internationally (sources A-H). At a Sheep\u000d\u000a      Veterinary Society meeting (September 2011) we presented our evidence that\u000d\u000a      ID and FR are the same disease, a concept that was not accepted by many in\u000d\u000a      the UK's veterinary and farming community. As a result of this, the Sheep\u000d\u000a      Veterinary Society drafted new national recommendations on the treatment\u000d\u000a      and control of FR in sheep that are due to be published (source C).\u000d\u000a      Multiple hundreds of specialist sheep vets have been using PAT since 2006\u000d\u000a      and have seen the benefits for their clients (sources D and E).\u000d\u000aAt an\u000d\u000a      international level, the major impact has been an increasing acceptance\u000d\u000a      and understanding that management of FR has to vary by country and is\u000d\u000a      dependent on prevalence of the disease and local climate. In the past,\u000d\u000a      adoption of Australian managements in GB has been a major stumbling block\u000d\u000a      and disenfranchised farmers who became frustrated that the managements\u000d\u000a      they used were ineffective. Warwick's research has been taken up in\u000d\u000a      Germany, where it has been used extensively by their national sheep\u000d\u000a      veterinary society in their national flock health improvement programme\u000d\u000a      and published in a book specifically written about footrot in sheep\u000d\u000a      (source F). National recognition is evidenced: Professor Green was awarded\u000d\u000a      the Royal Agricultural Society for England Research Medal in 2012 for\u000d\u000a      \"outstanding scientific work in reducing the impact of footrot in sheep\".\u000d\u000a    Farmers: Professor Green has explained PAT, with supporting\u000d\u000a      evidence, at over 50 farmer meetings since 2005 with audiences of 20 to\u000d\u000a      200 sheep farmers. She has many individual emails from farmers reporting\u000d\u000a      in their success. An example of farmer success is a letter from a Welsh\u000d\u000a      sheep farmer and member of FAWC (source G). In 2006, Professor Green and\u000d\u000a      her team worked with EBLEX to produce a Better Returns manual on\u000d\u000a      \"Minimising Lameness\" (distributed to 50,000 producers) and CD (5,000\u000d\u000a      copies including a library of condition images to help with lesion\u000d\u000a      identification and further details; video footage from this has been on\u000d\u000a      YouTube since January 2012 at http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ncymc3r)\u000d\u000a      (source H). Updates and further information were sent to 30,000 producers\u000d\u000a      as a paper bulletin. In a survey of participants carried out for EBLEX by\u000d\u000a      independent survey specialists Noesis in 2010, 57% of sheep farmers\u000d\u000a      surveyed claimed to have adopted at least one of the methods from the\u000d\u000a      research on sheep health (source I). Similar information has been produced\u000d\u000a      by farmers in Wales by HCC and Farming Connect, both by Green and Welsh\u000d\u000a      Vets. Green has spoken at and attended agricultural shows such as The\u000d\u000a      Royal Show, Sheep 2006, Sheep 2008 and Sheep 2010 to promote the new\u000d\u000a      approach to managing footrot to farmers. As a result of the 2009 BBSRC\u000d\u000a      Industrial Partnership, Green initiated \"train the trainer\" events with\u000d\u000a      EBLEX in 2010, these are professional development days geared towards vets\u000d\u000a      that educate them on lameness and other important issues that sheep\u000d\u000a      farmers want their vet to understand e.g. nutrition and genetics with the\u000d\u000a      aim of reaching out to their clients.\u000d\u000a    Other approaches to impact\u000d\u000a    In addition to the dissemination activities mentioned above, the Warwick\u000d\u000a      team has developed and maintains a website on footrot for farmers and vets\u000d\u000a      with a very high hit rate, over 2000 individual visitors per 6 months (http:\/\/www.footrotinsheep.org)\u000d\u000a      (source J). Articles were published in veterinary and industry journals\u000d\u000a      (UK Vet, RCVS website, Journal of RASE, 2012). The findings have also been\u000d\u000a      publicised through articles in national and local papers - The Daily\u000d\u000a      Telegraph (16 October 2008), Western Daily Press (25 October 2008) and\u000d\u000a      Western Morning News (22 October 2008) - and in the farming press -\u000d\u000a      Farmers Guardian (14 November 2008), Farmers Weekly (2011) and The Sheep\u000d\u000a      Farmer (2008). Professor Green participated in a webinar hosted by\u000d\u000a      Farmer's Weekly in 2012. The Warwick work has been widely reported\u000d\u000a      internationally (Canada 2011, USA 2011, Ireland 2012).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Footrot (FR) causes 90% of lameness in sheep. FR reduces productivity and\u000d\u000a      lowers sheep welfare. Research at the University of Warwick, initiated in\u000d\u000a      1999 and still active, has led to the development of a novel management\u000d\u000a      strategy for footrot in sheep: prompt antibiotic treatment (PAT) - sheep\u000d\u000a      treated with intramuscular and topical antibiotics within three days of\u000d\u000a      becoming lame with FR. This has resulted in a reduction in the overall\u000d\u000a      prevalence of lameness in sheep flocks in England from 10% (2004) to 5%\u000d\u000a      (2011) and 3% (2013). In 2011, evidence from research at Warwick on PAT\u000d\u000a      was used by the Farm Animal Welfare Council of Great Britain to support\u000d\u000a      their statement that it was feasible to reduce the prevalence of lameness\u000d\u000a      in the national flock from 10% to 2% by 2021. From 2005 onwards, PAT has\u000d\u000a      been disseminated to 50,000 sheep farmers through knowledge transfer (KT)\u000d\u000a      by EBLEX, the levy body for sheep farmers in England using booklets, CDs\u000d\u000a      and more than 100 on-farm events. More than 50% of farmers who had\u000d\u000a      attended an EBLEX KT meeting on lameness stated that they had changed\u000d\u000a      their management of lameness as a result of new information from the\u000d\u000a      event. The Sheep Veterinary Society in the UK has adopted PAT as the\u000d\u000a      recognised management approach for FR and a leading sheep vet in Germany\u000d\u000a      has written a book promoting PAT. The work has been presented in Europe as\u000d\u000a      part of Animal Welfare Research in an Enlarged Europe (AWARE), an\u000d\u000a      EU-funded project educating all countries in the enlarged EU zone on\u000d\u000a      animal welfare (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/o6onaxd).\u000d\u000a      In 2012, the lead Warwick researcher Professor Green was awarded the Royal\u000d\u000a      Agricultural Society of England medal specifically for `impact to the\u000d\u000a      sheep farming community in reducing footrot in sheep'.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Warwick\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Warwick (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Warwick","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10007163}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a(identified in statement by superscript number)\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

Leaving sheep lame reduces\u000d\u000a      body condition, increases the risk of death, infertility or small litter\u000d\u000a      size and reduces lamb growth rates1. Research from Professor\u000d\u000a      Green's team at the University of Warwick's School of Life Sciences has\u000d\u000a      shown that interdigital dermatitis (ID) is a mild presentation of FR,\u000d\u000a      caused by the same bacterium, Dichelobacter nodosus (Calvo-Bado et\u000a        al., 2010; Witcomb, 2012).\u000d\u000a    Footrot (henceforward including ID) causes 90% of lameness in sheep in\u000d\u000a      England2 and reduces productivity and welfare1. The\u000d\u000a      cost to the GB sheep industry is estimated at &#163;24 - &#163;801\u000d\u000a      million per year. In 1999, Warwick researchers, together with\u000d\u000a      collaborators at Bristol University, proposed that either the current\u000d\u000a      recommended methods to control lameness were ineffective or that farmers\u000d\u000a      were unable to implement them effectively. Management of FR at that time\u000d\u000a      centred on regular whole- flock managements of foot trimming and\u000d\u000a      footbathing. Individual lame sheep were primarily treated by trimming hoof\u000d\u000a      horn to reveal foot lesions, and spraying feet with topical disinfectant.\u000d\u000a      There was no evidence that this approach was effective and the 1999 study\u000d\u000a      indicated that farmers who were managing FR effectively were treating all\u000d\u000a      individual sheep lame with FR3 using antibiotic by injection\u000d\u000a      and topical application. The flock managements described above were\u000d\u000a      ineffective. In a Warwick-led 18-month within-farm clinical trial of 800\u000d\u000a      ewes (2005 to 2006)1 the mean prevalence of lameness in 400\u000d\u000a      ewes that were treated by foot trimming and foot spraying when lame with\u000d\u000a      FR was 7% over 18 months whilst the prevalence of lameness in 400 ewes\u000d\u000a      treated by PAT when lame with footrot fell to 2% after 6 - 12 weeks and\u000d\u000a      remained at this level3. A Warwick- only clinical trial (2008)4\u000d\u000a      was used to compare PAT and prompt foot trimming with topical disinfectant\u000d\u000a      on time to recovery in a factorial design with 53 ten-month-old ewes.\u000d\u000a      Results were that PAT of sheep lame with FR led to recovery from lameness\u000d\u000a      and active foot lesions in one to ten days in over 95% of sheeep4\u000d\u000a      whilst less than 25% of sheep treated with the traditional method of foot\u000d\u000a      trimming and topical disinfectant recovered in ten days4.\u000d\u000a      Further analysis of the 2005 - 2006 data indicated that PAT prevented\u000d\u000a      development of poor foot conformation and led to recovery from existing\u000d\u000a      poor foot conformation; it also prevented recurrent lameness5.\u000d\u000a      In another Warwick-only study (2005)6 it was shown that whilst\u000d\u000a      farmers could identify lame sheep accurately (giving confidence to farmer\u000d\u000a      estimates of prevalence of lameness in their flock1,3 ) they\u000d\u000a      did not treat all lame sheep but made a separate decision on whether to\u000d\u000a      catch and treat lame sheep6,7. Consequently, some lame sheep\u000d\u000a      are left untreated, rather than being treated promptly. Farmers that\u000d\u000a      delayed treatment of lame sheep reported a higher prevalence of lameness\u000d\u000a      in their flock than those who treated lame sheep promptly6.\u000d\u000aIn\u000d\u000a      conclusion, approximately 80% of the 10% prevalence of lameness in sheep\u000d\u000a      can be explained by delay in treatment of sheep with FR, together with\u000d\u000a      using the sub-optimal treatment of foot trimming and foot spraying. If all\u000d\u000a      farmers adopted PAT the prevalence of lameness in the GB flock would be\u000d\u000a      expected to fall from 10% to 2%, with much of the 2% prevalence of\u000d\u000a      lameness being sheep recovering from FR or lameness caused by conditions\u000d\u000a      other than FR. From the 2005 to 2006 study, in a flock with an average\u000d\u000a      prevalence of 7% lameness, the net loss of failing to use PAT was &#163;6 to\u000d\u000a      &#163;10 per ewe in 20061.\u000d\u000a    Some of this research was carried out in conjunction with the University\u000d\u000a      of Bristol: Warwick led all the research.

Sometimes it's\u000d\u000a      dramatic, like the rodent swarms in South Asia leading to widespread\u000d\u000a      famine and civil war. Often it is more hidden and chronic, like nibbling\u000d\u000a      away 20% of a family's grain store or spreading disease - part of daily\u000d\u000a      life in developing countries. In each case, mystery has shrouded both\u000d\u000a      causes and effects of rodent damage, leading either to wildly\u000d\u000a      inappropriate treatment or no treatment. Against a background of neglect\u000d\u000a      in global research on rats as pests, Steven Belmain's work is arguably\u000d\u000a      more notable. He has helped mitigate a regional famine and save lives in\u000d\u000a      the most recent bamboo-related population outbreak in Bangladesh, and\u000d\u000a      changed national policy and prompted regular plague surveillance in South\u000d\u000a      Africa. He has demonstrated how an African city can reduce rat-transmitted\u000d\u000a      disease, and how rodent damage to crops can be reduced by over 75%. He has\u000d\u000a      shown how communities can transform health and livelihoods if they work\u000d\u000a      together and that rat-damage can be dealt with sustainably without using\u000d\u000a      poisons. Finally he has raised awareness through extensive media work.\u000d\u000a    When the food security disaster struck Bangladesh, the UNDP, WFP, Save\u000d\u000a      the Children and Helen Keller International (2008-2009) consulted Belmain\u000d\u000a      extensively to inform their international relief efforts to avert a\u000d\u000a      regional catastrophe [3b]. In 2008 Belmain was commissioned through the UN\u000d\u000a      to lead a team of scientific experts to apply his methods, first to\u000d\u000a      confirm the scale of the problem and second to provide evidence-based\u000d\u000a      policy intervention recommendations [3c]. Dr Belmain informed Government\u000d\u000a      of Bangladesh ministers with facts on the phenomenon at several\u000d\u000a      high-profile meetings to enable them to respond appropriately. The\u000d\u000a      adoption of his recommendations on how to reduce damage to agriculture and\u000d\u000a      health helped mitigate a regional famine and undoubtedly assisted in\u000d\u000a      saving many people's lives and livelihoods [3d, 3.2, 3.3]. When the bamboo\u000d\u000a      masting ended in 2010 there were no confirmed fatalities directly\u000d\u000a      attributed to food insecurity, a considerable improvement on the 10,000+\u000d\u000a      documented deaths that occurred in the region 50 years ago [5.7]. Many\u000d\u000a      food security assessments carried out by NGOs and UN agencies showed that\u000d\u000a      the famine caused severe food shortages, underweight children and mothers,\u000d\u000a      miscarriage and many other health and socio-economic problems including no\u000d\u000a      money for school fees and selling children. However, use of Belmain's\u000d\u000a      research helped mitigate the growing crisis by ensuring regional relief\u000d\u000a      efforts and funding for emergency food continued in a targeted fashion at\u000d\u000a      the appropriate scale and timing [5.6].\u000d\u000a    Dr Belmain's research in South Africa, which started in 2002 [3h, 3f, 3e,\u000d\u000a      3a], has led to changes in national and regional policies [5.8]. For\u000d\u000a      example, his discovery and highlighting of the absence of dedicated\u000d\u000a      qualifications in rodent pest management led the National Pesticide\u000d\u000a      Regulation Authority of South Africa to change its regulations: anyone\u000d\u000a      wishing to commercially engage in rodent management must now pass specific\u000d\u000a      examinations. Presently (2008-2013), all new qualifying pest control\u000d\u000a      operators who want to deal with rodents have a component on control of\u000d\u000a      rodents. In the city of Durban, Dr Belmain's research in the Ratzooman\u000d\u000a      project [3f] raised awareness of rodent diseases found in squatter camps\u000d\u000a      and informal settlements; it led to a clean-up campaign and\u000d\u000a      institutionalised rodent trapping programme by city authorities that\u000d\u000a      continues to be operated under the `Ratzooman' banner [3.5, 5.9].\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, Dr Belmain's research prompted the South African Department\u000d\u000a      of Health to establish a plague surveillance expert panel. It has operated\u000d\u000a      every year since 2006 and now routinely surveys \"at risk\" areas for plague\u000d\u000a      outbreaks [3.4, 5.8]. Belmain's research directly led to the development\u000d\u000a      of a new design rat trap by a commercial company in South Africa which has\u000d\u000a      been part of its sales portfolio every year since 2008, as part of its\u000d\u000a      pest control services. The trap is sold through existing marketing chains\u000d\u000a      nationally and for export throughout the member countries of the Southern\u000d\u000a      African Development Community [5.10].\u000d\u000a    Belmain's research has had considerable impact on society by raising\u000d\u000a      public awareness about rodents and the impact they have on people's\u000d\u000a      livelihoods in developing countries. Discovery Channel commissioned a\u000d\u000a      nature documentary featuring Dr Belmain in 2009, following his research on\u000d\u000a      rat swarms [5.3]. Other examples of media work include international radio\u000d\u000a      and internet programmes [5.2, 5.4, 5.5] as well as magazine articles in\u000d\u000a      journals such as Science [5.1]. Belmain's research on the\u000d\u000a      Bangladesh rat population outbreak has been incorporated into a book\u000d\u000a      [3,2], which will help inform future generations when the event happens\u000d\u000a      again and ensure better preparedness to avert famine.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Rats are responsible for massive damage through crop destruction, stored\u000d\u000a      food consumption and disease transmission.

While rodents\u000d\u000a      are a problem in many environments, their impact is more severe in\u000d\u000a      developing economies because their proximity to people is higher. Poor\u000d\u000a      agricultural practices and sanitation encourage rodents, impacting on\u000d\u000a      people and farming systems through pre- and post-harvest crop losses,\u000d\u000a      contamination of food and water and zoonosis transmission. Farmers and\u000d\u000a      householders, when conscious of the problem, have tended to rely on\u000d\u000a      poisons which contaminate the environment, are ineffective unless the\u000d\u000a      whole community acts together to eradicate a rodent population, and can be\u000d\u000a      lethal if sold and used without knowledge and care.\u000d\u000a    Dr Steven Belmain, Principal Scientist in Ecology, 1998 to present, has\u000d\u000a      researched the ecology and management of rodents and developed\u000d\u000a      technologies which reduce the multiple impacts on people's health and\u000d\u000a      livelihoods and are relevant to the agro-ecological and sociological\u000d\u000a      contexts found within African and Asian societies. Belmain, acting as\u000d\u000a      Principal Investigator, has collaborated with scientific teams from Europe\u000d\u000a      (Belgium, Netherlands, France, Germany, Denmark), Africa (Sierra Leone,\u000d\u000a      Tanzania, South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland), Asia\u000d\u000a      (China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India) and Australia. He has led\u000d\u000a      competitively-won projects involving multidisciplinary research\u000d\u000a      encompassing rodent population dynamics, systematics and taxonomy, habitat\u000d\u000a      utilisation, rodent behaviour, outbreak ecology, social anthropology,\u000d\u000a      economics, damage assessment methodologies, and the development of\u000d\u000a      non-chemical rodent population control and impact mitigation strategies.\u000d\u000a      The research has been undertaken in Africa and Asia in relation to a range\u000d\u000a      of agricultural and human health problems caused by rodents on cropping\u000d\u000a      systems and post-harvest food storage, as well as in non-agricultural\u000d\u000a      ecologies.\u000d\u000a    Belmain's main finding is that rodents can be sustainably managed without\u000d\u000a      using poisons. This can be done by strengthening communities to deal with\u000d\u000a      shared problems, the introduction of intensive trapping and trap barrier\u000d\u000a      systems, and environmental management to reduce the proximity of rodents\u000d\u000a      and people. Treatment-control studies of Belmain's research show that crop\u000d\u000a      damage can be reduced by more than 75% in ways that are environmentally\u000d\u000a      sustainable and cost-beneficial to subsistence farming communities [3.6].\u000d\u000a    In Bangladesh, Belmain's research included the causes and effects of\u000d\u000a      rodent population outbreaks, an infrequent 50-year phenomenon driven by\u000d\u000a      semelparous bamboo flowering. The most recent cycle started in 2004 in\u000d\u000a      India, reaching Bangladesh in 2007. Historical outbreaks 50 and 100 years\u000d\u000a      ago led to regional famine and civil war across India, Bangladesh and\u000d\u000a      Myanmar [3.2]. Despite this devastation, the science of the outbreaks\u000d\u000a      remained poorly understood, conflated by legend and anecdote, with little\u000d\u000a      consensus and much scepticism about the scale and impact of the events.\u000d\u000a      Belmain's research confirmed the baseline ecology of bamboo seed\u000d\u000a      production (this fuels exponential rodent breeding within forests,\u000d\u000a      producing up to seven generations in six months) and its linkage to rodent\u000d\u000a      outbreaks, to explain the scale of the regional famine occurring. As the\u000d\u000a      seed is depleted and germinates, rodents migrate out of forests and swarm\u000d\u000a      into crop fields, causing nearly 100% crop failure. Belmain was able to\u000d\u000a      combine this knowledge with research on how to reduce the damage to\u000d\u000a      agriculture and health.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3402","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Evaluation and substantiation of health claims for EFSA on soy\u000a        isoflavones and health: Health claims made in relation to food\u000a    products require authorisation under EU law before they can be used in the\u000a    labelling and marketing of products in the EU. EFSA are the EU agency who\u000a    are responsible for verifying the scientific substantiation of any health\u000a    claims. These health claims are a core marketing strategy that the global\u000a    food industry employ to increase sales of premium products with claimed\u000a    enhanced functionality. For the consumer, the demonstration of evidence-\u000a    based health claims can protect them from purchasing foods with misleading\u000a    information on potential benefits. To substantiate or refute the significant\u000a    number of claims made by the food industry, EFSA (the EU agency that\u000a    provides independent scientific advice and communication on existing and\u000a    emerging risks associated with the food chain) committees comprehensively\u000a    review all clinical trials and associated research following a submission by\u000a    the food industry to produce a panel consensus document (EFSA scientific\u000a    opinion). Our research has been used to underpin a number of EFSA scientific\u000a    opinions on health claims for isoflavones present in soy foods.\u000a    In 2009, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies\u000a      relied on some of our research (research reference 1-2) to develop a\u000a      scientific opinion that cause and effect relationships have not been\u000a      established between the consumption of soy isoflavones and the maintenance\u000a      of bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. Specifically, a distinct\u000a      contribution of our work (research reference 2) was to draw attention to\u000a      the `lack of evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between\u000a      dietary intake of soy isoflavones and the claimed effect, and the\u000a      different results obtained depending on the source and nature of the\u000a      isoflavones used' (pp.6-7, corroborating source A). This health claim was\u000a      reviewed by EFSA in 2012, and our EU funded work (research reference 1)\u000a      was used to further inform the opinion that consumption of soy isoflavones\u000a      does not show an effect on bone mineral density (pp. 8&amp;12,\u000a      corroborating source B). As a result, the health claim was rejected by\u000a      EFSA, and food companies (and others) are not permitted to promote food\u000a      containing soy isoflavones for bone health in Europe. Our research\u000a      (research reference 2) was also key to the rejection of other soy health\u000a      claims (corroborating source C) with the panel concluding that the\u000a      evidence for a cause and effect relationship was not established between\u000a      soy isoflavone consumption and a range of other health endpoints including\u000a      vasomotor symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors. Professor Cassidy's\u000a      earlier work on soy foods, specifically soy protein, was used to underpin\u000a      decisions on health claims relating to heart health in the USA (Food &amp;\u000a      Drink Administration, 1999) and the UK Joint Health Claims Initiative\u000a      (JHCI) (2002).\u000a    Risk assessment `Hazard characterisation of isoflavones' -\u000a          Refinement of regulation EC 1924\/2006: Professor Cassidy,\u000a      through her research outputs and committee involvement has significantly\u000a      informed the policy debate surrounding the potential risks:benefits of\u000a      consuming soy isoflavones. Some controversy surrounds the consumption of\u000a      soy, given its oestrogenic potential and the potential for high levels of\u000a      exposure in certain population groups through supplement use and soy\u000a      infant formula. Our research has influenced the consensus statements of\u000a      international government agencies including EFSA, the American Heart\u000a      Association (AHA) Advisory group and the UK Government Committee on\u000a      Toxicity (COT), who have examined the potential hazards associated with\u000a      consumption of soy isoflavones.\u000a    In the UK, COT's policy review of the toxicity of chemicals in the diet\u000a      was informed by Cassidy's soy isoflavones based research. The recent 2012\u000a      initial report focusses on the infant diet in support of a review by the\u000a      UK Government Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition on infant\u000a      feeding. In particular, the report uses UEA research (research reference\u000a      3) to provide scientific evidence on the absorption of isoflavones by the\u000a      body, depending on age and the food source (pp.6-7, corroborating source\u000a      G). This expands on COT advice in 2003 (corroborating source F), which\u000a      used earlier Cassidy research, and partly defined the UK government's\u000a      subsequent research programme on phytoestrogens\/isoflavones. Professor\u000a      Cassidy's earlier work on soy also informed an American Heart Association\u000a      advisory for health professionals on the risks:benefits from soy intake\u000a      (2006, corroborating source H).\u000a    In summary, our impact has been to protect the public by providing\u000a      balanced scientific evidence for health claims, and to raise awareness of\u000a      the potential risk:benefit profile of consuming soy foods with a specific\u000a      focus on isoflavones.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our impact has been to protect the public by informing and influencing\u000a      both the international policy debate on health claims associated with soy\u000a      consumption, and the relevant regulatory risk assessment authorities.\u000a    Our research formed a key component of dossiers that resulted in the\u000a      rejection of health claims by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA,\u000a      the EU agency responsible for the scientific substantiation of health\u000a      claims) relating to soy isoflavones and a number of health endpoints\u000a      including bone health, heart health and menopausal symptoms.

This robust long-term trial\u000a      observed no effect of isoflavone consumption on validated measures of\u000a      osteoporosis risk, and provided strong supportive evidence for the EFSA\u000a      opinion to conclude that consumption of soy isoflavones were not effective\u000a      in preventing bone loss. The EFSA opinion was further informed by our\u000a      research conducted as part of a pan-EU network of excellence called\u000a      Phytohealth (research reference 2) which examined optimal dose, food\u000a      source and duration of use of isoflavones for a range of health outcomes\u000a      including bone health. Our research (research reference 2) was also\u000a      considered in the EFSA panel decisions to reject other soy health claims\u000a      (corroborating source C) with the panel concluding that the evidence for a\u000a      cause and effect relationship was not established between soy isoflavone\u000a      consumption and a range of health endpoints including vasomotor symptoms\u000a      and cardiovascular risk factors.\u000a    Risk assessment of isoflavones: There has been substantial\u000a      debate on the risks:benefits of soy isoflavones for specific consumer\u000a      groups, including infants fed soy infant formula, and postmenopausal\u000a      women. For postmenopausal women there has been significant focus on\u000a      potential risks in relation to hormonal effects, breast cancer risk and\u000a      thyroid function. Hormonal effects have been investigated in numerous\u000a      studies, but findings have been equivocal and the risks:benefit is a\u000a      contentious issue. Our research on how isoflavones are absorbed and\u000a      handled by the body (bioavailability) reported on the importance of the\u000a      dietary form of the food and showed that isoflavones are more rapidly\u000a      absorbed from soy milk than from solid soy foods (research reference 3).\u000a      Using our original clinical trial data (investigating how these compounds\u000a      are metabolised by the body and their health effects) together with our\u000a      expertise in systematic reviewing methodologies, our research has provided\u000a      considerable clarity in areas where medical and public concern had been\u000a      expressed. We also showed that given the totality of evidence the effects\u000a      on hormonal status are modest and unlikely to be deleterious to health\u000a      (research reference 4) and do not alter breast density (a biomarker of\u000a      breast cancer risk in either pre- or post- menopausal women) (research\u000a      reference 5). Furthermore we have shown that the source of soy is critical\u000a      for potential cardiovascular benefits: soy protein isolate in food, but\u000a      not in isolated isoflavone supplements, improved blood pressure and\u000a      cholesterol levels (research reference 6).\u000a    Lead UEA researchers:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aA Cassidy, Professor of Nutrition (UEA since 2004), played a\u000a        leading role in all the studies. Professor Cassidy published the first\u000a        paper showing the biological effects of soy isoflavones in humans in\u000a        1994.

Micronutrient deficiencies adversely affect the health\u000a      of a large proportion of the world population and according to the WHO,\u000a      over 1.3 million children die each year because of micronutrient\u000a      deficiencies in three critical micronutrients that are most limiting in\u000a      the diet (iron, zinc, and vitamin A). Inadequate micronutrient intake and\u000a      status is also a problem in industrialised countries especially in\u000a      relation to iron. In sharp contrast, an excess intake of particular\u000a      micronutrients is associated with an increased risk of chronic disease,\u000a      exemplified by the association between dietary sodium intake and\u000a      cardiovascular disease.\u000a    WHO Guidelines: We provided core expertise in systematic\u000a      review methodology and meta- analysis for the WHO Guidance Expert Advisory\u000a      Group to assess the scientific data on the effects of potassium and sodium\u000a      intakes on human health. On the basis of the research in (7), WHO\u000a      developed its first guideline for potassium intake. This new guideline\u000a      (corroborating source A) states that:\u000a      `adults and children without compromised renal handling of potassium\u000a        should increase their potassium intake from food and that adults should\u000a        consume &gt;90 mmol potassium\/d for beneficial effects on blood pressure\u000a        and risk of related cardiovascular disease'.\u000a    WHO recommends that this is adjusted downwards for children, based on\u000a      their relative energy requirements.\u000a    Our WHO committee work and BMJ meta-analysis (research reference 8) has\u000a      also informed the revision and update of the WHO guidelines for sodium\u000a      (corroborating source B) which states:\u000a    `WHO recommends a reduction in sodium intake to reduce blood pressure\u000a        and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart disease in\u000a        adults. WHO recommends a reduction to &lt;2 g\/day sodium (5 g\/day\u000a        salt)'.\u000a    and established a new WHO guideline for children, which states:\u000a      `WHO recommends a reduction in sodium intake to control blood pressure\u000a        in children. The recommended maximum level of intake of 2 g\/day sodium\u000a        in adults should be adjusted downward based on the energy requirements\u000a        of children relative to those of adults'.\u000a    European Food Standards Authority (EFSA) work: There is no\u000a      uniform approach for establishing micronutrient recommendations, and the\u000a      large variations across Europe create confusion among consumers, food\u000a      producers and policy-makers.

Of the six micronutrients\u000a      reviewed in our EFSA-funded work, detailed draft opinions have\u000a      significantly advanced policy and have already been released by the EFSA\u000a      committee on two micronutrients, molybdenum and fluoride (corroborating\u000a      sources C and D). The other EFSA opinions will be released in the 2013-14\u000a      period.\u000a    Our expertise in this area is also having impact on the development of\u000a      micronutrient nutrition policy\/guidelines by individual nations. One\u000a      example is the Nordic countries, who collectively set their nutritional\u000a      recommendations and dietary guidelines. Professor Fairweather-Tait was\u000a      appointed to the international Reference Group for the development of the\u000a      NNR5 guidelines as a result of her micronutrient expertise and involvement\u000a      with developing the methodologies for EURRECA (http:\/\/www.slv.se\/en-gb\/Startpage-NNR\/Reference-group\/\u000a      ).\u000a    Micronutrient deficiencies - impact on food security: The world is\u000a      facing a potential crisis in terms of food security. The challenge is to\u000a      produce and supply enough safe and nutritious food in a sustainable way\u000a      for a growing global population, which is projected to reach 9 billion by\u000a      2050. Micronutrient deficiencies are a significant public health problem\u000a      in developing countries and Fairweather-Tait's EURRECA work has informed\u000a      the development of an international biofortification programme,\u000a      HarvestPlus, partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.\u000a      HarvestPlus is helping to develop breeding of staple foods that are a\u000a      better source of micronutrients, and works with key international\u000a      stakeholders in micronutrient research, including Fairweather-Tait. In\u000a      order to define targets for the level of zinc needed in biofortified rice\u000a      or wheat to have an impact on health, HarvestPlus was informed by the\u000a      findings from a workshop organised by EURRECA on intake-status-health\u000a      relationships, and the systematic review of biomarkers of zinc status.\u000a      HarvestPlus is now developing two key staples for the Indian\u000a      sub-continent, rice and wheat, biofortified with optimal levels of zinc\u000a      (final report, corroborating source E).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Although an adequate micronutrient intake and status is necessary for\u000a      health and deficiency disease prevention, an excess dietary intake may\u000a      have deleterious effects on health.

The research spans a continuous period\u000a      of 30 years, with some of the earlier work carried out by Fairweather-Tait\u000a      at the Institute of Food Research (one of the partner Institutes of the\u000a      Norwich Research Park) and subsequent work from 2005 (Hooper) and 2007\u000a      (Fairweather- Tait, Collings) at UEA.\u000a    In order to establish dietary requirements for different population\u000a      groups, and to assess the impact of implementation, information on\u000a      micronutrient intake, bioavailability, and the relationship with health\u000a      end-points is required. From 2007-2012, UEA was one of the main driving\u000a      forces leading the EURopean RECommendations Aligned (EURRECA) Network of\u000a      Excellence, funded by the European Commission to develop scientific\u000a      outputs (`tools') to harmonise European micronutrient recommendations.\u000a      Deriving such values in a transparent, systematic way is challenging. To\u000a      explore the relationship between micronutrient status and health, it is\u000a      important to understand which markers of micronutrient status can be\u000a      relied on and under what circumstances. A critical piece of our research\u000a      was to provide detailed data from randomised controlled trials to\u000a      establish sensitive biomarkers of status associated with particular levels\u000a      of intake (research references 1-2) and these contributed to our\u000a      development of a comprehensive methodology framework to assess which\u000a      biomarkers reflect changes in nutritional status in different population\u000a      groups (research references 3-6).\u000a    Our systematic review and meta-analysis (research reference 7) integrated\u000a      the available high quality research on potassium and health. Prior to this\u000a      work, the evidence on the potential beneficial effect of increased\u000a      potassium intake on blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk was\u000a      inconsistent. Specifically, our meta-analysis showed that increased\u000a      potassium resulted in a decrease in blood pressure and that the greatest\u000a      impact was achieved when potassium intake was 90-120 mmol\/day.\u000a    To inform the development of a WHO global guideline on sodium, our BMJ\u000a      meta-analysis quantified dose-response relationships and showed that\u000a      reducing sodium intake to &lt;2 g\/day resulted in significant and\u000a      clinically relevant decreases in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure\u000a      was reduced by 3.47 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure by 1.81 mmHg) (research\u000a      reference 8). This is now the WHO recommended intake for adults.

The beneficiaries are the protected\u000a      animals in terms of animal welfare, poultry farmers globally in terms of\u000a      economic efficiency and the general public in terms of economic high\u000a      quality protein availability from meat and eggs, i.e. food security.\u000a    Economic and health impacts\u000a    The Liverpool vaccine has been important in global AMPV control. It is\u000a      one of only two subtype A live vaccines used globally. Its profile is\u000a      summarised in the DEFRA 2012 summary sheet [7].The continued use of the\u000a      vaccine is enhanced by the Liverpool team's on-going research into its\u000a      applications and usage, thus helping ensure the product's safety and\u000a      efficacious use. It is only the effective application AMPV vaccine in\u000a      hatcheries and on farms that prevents the severe disease and losses seen\u000a      prior to vaccine introduction. UoL researchers have been key to\u000a      maintaining this major impact on disease protection in a major food\u000a      species. Eight million doses of the vaccine were sold in Europe, Africa\u000a      and the Middle East in the last financial year, much comprising UK turkeys\u000a      (production approx 17 million per year) and to a lesser extent in France.\u000a      This is a 20% sales increase over the previous year, an indication of both\u000a      the importance of the disease and the performance of the vaccine. The\u000a      figure does not include Asia\/Pacific and South America (particularly\u000a      Brazil) which are the biggest markets for the vaccine.\u000a    The Liverpool team's on-going research has allowed for the development of\u000a      improved guidelines allowing the poultry industry to protect essential\u000a      food production and maximise profit. [9,10,12,13]\u000a    Vaccine developments arising from the UoL research that have had an\u000a      impact on the industry primarily by increasing effectiveness of the use of\u000a      the vaccine since 2008 have included:\u000a    \u000a      Demonstration of reversion to virulence on farms of the Zoetis clone K\u000a        vaccine in 2006 led to the UoL demonstrating in 2011 that such reverted\u000a        virus could circulate in the environment and in 2012 to the UoL's\u000a        demonstration that a Merial subtype B vaccine could also revert to\u000a        virulence on farms. The Liverpool group now advises at national (British\u000a        Veterinary Poultry Association) and international (World Veterinary\u000a        Poultry Association) poultry veterinary meetings that all AMPV vaccines\u000a        should be administered more effectively so as to avoid unvaccinated\u000a        birds becoming infected with potentially reverting shed vaccine virus.\u000a        Changes of farming practice resulted, especially in Europe. More careful\u000a        vaccine application became the standard, so as to avoid residual\u000a        unvaccinated birds being infected with vaccine shed from littermates.\u000a        Furthermore, multi-age-site-farms have fallen out of usage because of\u000a        the greater level of susceptibility of young birds to any vaccine virus\u000a        passaged in the environment. As a result, the current MSD product advice\u000a        relating to their AMPV Nobilis TRT live vaccine, states \"The vaccine\u000a          virus spreads and shows some reversion to virulence on bird to bird\u000a          passage. For these reasons its use is not recommended on multi-age\u000a          sites. Correct administration is important ...\" [8,9,10,12,13].\u000a      The UoL discovered that maternal antibody did not block vaccination.\u000a        This led to adoption of one-day-old hatchery vaccination where\u000a        previously, administration had been later on the farm. This is\u000a        formalised in the DEFRA summary sheet for the Liverpool developed clone\u000a        K vaccine (Zoetis, Poulvac TRT) [7 (page 1),9].\u000a      The question of matching AMPV vaccine subtype (A or B) to the\u000a        prevalent field subtype has been debated since the discovery of subtypes\u000a        in 1993. Some parties, especially vaccine manufacturers, downplayed the\u000a        issue, even though introduction of subtype B vaccine to the UK in 1995\u000a        to combat the first UK incidences of subtype B, led to a large\u000a        improvement in disease control (based on research by Naylor while at IAH\u000a        Compton). More influentially, from 2008 to 2010 Liverpool\/Bologna\u000a        studies (published 2010) conclusively proved that even small differences\u000a        within a subtype had large effects on induced protection [2]. Currently\u000a        AMPV vaccines of the correct subtype are favoured where the dominating\u000a        field subtype is known [11].\u000a      The UoL showed in 2010 that the continuous use of a single AMPV\u000a        vaccine (Merial Aviffa\/Rhinovax) in Italy had led to evolution of field\u000a        viruses in circulation which avoided previously protective immunity.\u000a        This showed that exclusive use of a single vaccine type should be\u000a        avoided and work has been presented to Italian veterinarians advising\u000a        avoiding this practice who now avoid this practice where possible [9].\u000a      For some time it had been noticed that following vaccination the AMPV\u000a        antibody might be absent, even though field survey evidence suggested\u000a        that the birds were protected. Without the UoL's discovery that an AMPV\u000a        induced antibody responses was irrelevant to protection and frequently\u000a        absent, the use of AMPV vaccines might have much reduced, thus reducing\u000a        disease control [13].\u000a      \u000aIn ovo vaccination proved effective in producing an earlier\u000a        onset of immunity. At the present time commercial restrictions have\u000a        limited this to approach to small scale use [9].\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since its discovery in the 1980s, avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) has spread\u000a      in poultry populations worldwide with major adverse health and food\u000a      security implications for commercial chickens and turkeys. Research at the\u000a      University of Liverpool (UoL) led to the registration of a live vaccine in\u000a      1994 which has played a global role in AMPV control, thereby safeguarding\u000a      the supply of poultry meat and eggs. Recent research and development at\u000a      the UoL has identified key control measures, relating to vaccine\u000a      application, vaccine selection, efficacy and safety, which have had a\u000a      significant impact on poultry health and consequently, poultry producers\u000a      and consumers. In particular, demonstration that live AMPV vaccines can\u000a      revert to virulence, that vaccine type applied influences field protection\u000a      and that continuous use of a single vaccine can influence circulating\u000a      field strains, has resulted in UoL leading policy making with regard to\u000a      current AMPV vaccine protocols.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Liverpool (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Liverpool","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10006842}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

It had high morbidities and mortalities in\u000a      turkeys which also affected laying and broiler chickens. A vaccine\u000a      industry research strategist recently estimated that 6 billion turkeys and\u000a      chickens worldwide could benefit from effective AMPV vaccination.\u000a    Starting in the late 1980s, the UoL group of Dr RC Jones with Dr R\u000a      Williams and Dr CJ Naylor modified a virulent AMPV field isolate to yield\u000a      a protective live vaccine candidate. While protective and attenuated, this\u000a      unfortunately caused some disease after serial passage in turkeys in\u000a      experimental conditions, but following the UoL's use of cloning to remove\u000a      virulent AMPV subpopulation, derivative clone K became a registered\u000a      vaccine (Poulvac TRT) with European mutual international recognition for\u000a      use in turkeys in 1997. The same product was licensed for chickens as\u000a      Poulvac SHS (1998). The current licence holder is Zeotis. The vaccine is\u000a      also registered in other major poultry producing regions including Latin\u000a      America and Asia.\u000a    The subsequent work, starting in 2001, associated with the current impact\u000a      case was led by senior lecturer Naylor of the Department of Infection\u000a      Biology, UoL and frequently involved international academic and commercial\u000a      collaboration in Italy and Germany. Key to much of this was the\u000a      development of high level molecular AMPV expertise which included\u000a      development of the first AMPV reverse genetics system [1]. Classical\u000a      studies by the UoL explored the use of Liverpool's clone K and other AMPV\u000a      vaccines both experimentally and on farms and demonstrated its acceptable\u000a      efficacy in the face of maternal antibody, full protection in the absence\u000a      of any induced anti-AMPV antibody (1997). AMPV specific molecular\u000a      expertise facilitated molecular field studies, full genome sequencing\u000a      studies and the construction of modified viruses to test hypotheses.\u000a      Following the UoL's detection of AMPV subtype B in the UK for the first\u000a      time using RT-PCR (published 1987), the UoL investigated the importance of\u000a      matching within AMPV subtypes. Using in-house developed full genome\u000a      sequencing protocols, the group discovered that field virus could evolve\u000a      in the face of prevailing vaccine pressure [2] (2010) and that those\u000a      changes involved the attachment protein [3], thus allowing current RT-PCR\u000a      sequencing studies to target sections of this gene when investigating\u000a      field strains likely to avoid vaccine induced protection. The UoL group\u000a      previously proved that field disease was being caused by reversion to\u000a      virulence of both clone K [4], then demonstrated in 2011 that similar\u000a      clone K derived reverted virus could spread in the environment [5] and for\u000a      the first time in 2012 that a commonly used commercial subtype B vaccine\u000a      could also revert on farms (manuscript in preparation). Using reverse\u000a      genetics, a molecular cause of the virulence increase in clone K was\u000a      established [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3877","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Liverpool team has used their research findings to create significant\u000d\u000a      economic benefits for the\u000d\u000a      UK's cattle industry by collaborating directly with AHVLA and\u000d\u000a      Myhealthyherd to design herd health\u000d\u000a      schemes to reduce the economic impact of N. caninum.

As a consequence, as key participants\u000d\u000a      in AHVLA working\u000d\u000a      groups, Williams and Trees were involved in designing herd health schemes\u000d\u000a      to improve control of\u000d\u000a      disease. In 2008\/9, two schemes were launched, one a commercial scheme,\u000d\u000a      Myhealthyherd, and\u000d\u000a      the other, AHVLA's Herdsure scheme [7], both based on advice on reducing\u000d\u000a      transmission built on\u000d\u000a      research done at University of Liverpool. A series of roadshows, delivered\u000d\u000a      by Professor Trees in\u000d\u000a      2008-9 was used to publicise these accreditation schemes. To ensure the\u000d\u000a      widest possible reach,\u000d\u000a      these DEFRA funded roadshows targeted hundreds of veterinarians each of\u000d\u000a      whom were asked to\u000d\u000a      hold multiple farmer meetings. These schemes focus on identifying infected\u000d\u000a      animals within a herd\u000d\u000a      and strategically managing breeding programmes and heifer replacement\u000d\u000a      regimes to reduce the\u000d\u000a      number of infected cows entering the milking herd. Within these\u000d\u000a      programmes, regular nationwide\u000d\u000a      surveillance using bulk tank milk antibody tests are used to monitor\u000d\u000a      levels of N. caninum infection\u000d\u000a      within herds typically through NMR\/NML. Biosecurity measures including\u000d\u000a      quarantine testing,\u000d\u000a      control of dogs on the farm and covering feed stores to reduce risk of\u000d\u000a      contamination are\u000d\u000a      recommended to control the spread of infection. There has been widespread\u000d\u000a      publicity and it has\u000d\u000a      even featured on the popular BBC 4 soap opera, the Archers.\u000d\u000a    The team's research into abortion storms and quantifying the risk of\u000d\u000a      post-natal exposure to\u000d\u000a      infection have led to an increase in our understanding of frequency of\u000d\u000a      different routes of\u000d\u000a      transmission of Neospora. In addition, advisory meetings were held\u000d\u000a      with AHVLA in 2008 to assist\u000d\u000a      in developing its herd health farm assurance scheme prior to its launch in\u000d\u000a      2009\/10. Information\u000d\u000a      about these two schemes are disseminated to dairy farmers through the\u000d\u000a      farming press, advisory\u000d\u000a      information sent out by AHVLA and through a private scheme with a\u000d\u000a      dedicated website.

As a result,\u000d\u000aProudman's research findings and conclusions have been incorporated (2010 - 2012) into equine\u000d\u000ahealthcare guidelines and widely adopted in the UK and internationally.\u000d\u000aDiagnosis and preventative treatment\u000d\u000aThe development by the UoL of a serological test for tapeworm infection has given veterinary\u000d\u000asurgeons and researchers a risk assessment tool and which has become a key diagnostic assay\u000d\u000athat is in routine use in equine medicine. The University of Liverpool operates a commercial\u000d\u000adiagnostic service for the test (branded as \"Diagnosteq\"). This service is widely used by vets in the\u000d\u000aUK and Europe. During the period 2008 to 2012, the service tested 19,887 samples for clinicians to\u000d\u000aguide worm control programmes. The serological test for equine tapeworm infection is unique to\u000d\u000athis laboratory. The 'Diagnosteq' service has also undertaken serological testing for\u000d\u000aepidemiological research purposes on samples from 15 different countries, including the USA,\u000d\u000aCanada, Australia, Japan, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Italy.\u000d\u000aProudman's research showed a clear reduction in colic risk when anti-tapeworm anthelmintics\u000d\u000awere used. The launch of anti-tapeworm anthelmintics has been accompanied by extensive public\u000d\u000aengagement activities, including websites [e.g. 14] and CPD courses for equine surgeons [15] to\u000d\u000araise public and industry awareness of the value of their usage to prevent life threatening colic in\u000d\u000ahorses.\u000d\u000aAwareness raising\u000d\u000aThe importance of equine tapeworm control is now embedded in undergraduate veterinary\u000d\u000acurricula, CPD programmes for practising veterinary surgeons and training of lay prescribers of\u000d\u000aanthelmintic drugs (Suitably Qualified Persons) [8] and sources of professional information [9].\u000d\u000aIncreased awareness of intestinal tapeworms as a risk to horse health, plus the knowledge and\u000d\u000aproducts to implement effective tapeworm control is now widely available to the general public of\u000d\u000ahorse owners [e.g. 7,10,11,12].\u000d\u000aEquine anthelmintic market\u000d\u000aRecognising the significance of Proudman's research to equine healthcare programmes, several\u000d\u000ainternational animal health pharmaceutical companies have applied for marketing authorisation\u000d\u000aand launched anti-tapeworm anthelmintics for use in horses citing the UoL research as indicating a\u000d\u000aneed for tapeworm control in horses. Veterinary sales clearly indicate significant growth in the anti-\u000d\u000atapeworm sector of the equine anthelmintic market. During the impact qualifying period (2008 -\u000d\u000a2012), five pharmaceutical companies (Elanco, Intervet, Merial, Pfizer and Virbac) were marketing\u000d\u000abetween 15 - 17 anti-tapeworm products with &#163;9.7m sales in 2010. This compares to a market of 5\u000d\u000aproducts produced by 2 companies and annual sales of just &#163;3.9m in 2001; a 250% increase in\u000d\u000asales. Veterinary practise sales represent only 15-20% of total veterinary anthelmintic sales, the\u000d\u000aremainder being sold directly to horse-owners. Some companies use serological testing for risk\u000d\u000ascreening [13].\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aResearch at the University of Liverpool (UoL) has demonstrated the importance of intestinal\u000d\u000atapeworm infection as an important and hitherto unrecognised risk factor for a major life-threatening\u000d\u000aacute intestinal disease (colic) in the horse.

However, tapeworm infection was difficult to diagnose by coprological methods, thus\u000d\u000ahampering investigation of the host-parasite relationship.\u000d\u000aUoL epidemiological research by Professor Chris Proudman and colleagues in the 1990s [1,2]\u000d\u000aidentified the equine tapeworm Anoplocephala perfoliata as a significant cause of intestinal\u000d\u000adisease. This work won two awards [1]. As part of the work a novel serological diagnostic test\u000d\u000a(ELISA) was then developed to detect A. perfoliata infection and demonstrated a highly significant\u000d\u000aassociation between tapeworm infection and two specific types of equine intestinal disease. A\u000d\u000adose-response relationship was also reported indicating increased risk of intestinal disease with\u000d\u000aincreasing tapeworm infection intensity; this feature of the diagnostic test has proven critical to its\u000d\u000ause in disease prevention.\u000d\u000aColic is a major health issue with horses and is responsible for a quarter of horse deaths and costs\u000d\u000aover $120m in the USA alone, with 66% of that loss associated with horse death. Proudman\u000d\u000ashowed that the diseases associated with tapeworm infection were (i) \"spasmodic colic,\" a low\u000d\u000amortality, high morbidity disease, and (ii) ileal impaction colic, a low incidence but high morbidity\u000d\u000acondition. The incidence of spasmodic colic is high, estimated at 1 case per 10 horse years at risk,\u000d\u000aand thus effective prevention or intervention would have significant clinical impact. The high\u000d\u000amorbidity of ileal impaction colic also indicates potentially high impact of effective interventions.\u000d\u000aSince the original UoL research, a number of field-based clinical studies led by Proudman, in\u000d\u000aconjunction with Verbac Animal Health and the Universities of Glasgow and Pisa, have explored\u000d\u000athe use of the serological tapeworm diagnostic test in populations of horses [3-6]. Specifically, they\u000d\u000ahave identified a clear reduction in colic risk associated with anti-tapeworm anthelmintic use,\u000d\u000ainvestigated adverse drug reactions following the use of anti-tapeworm anthelmintics and have\u000d\u000adescribed the dynamics of post-treatment antibody responses which are key to clinical\u000d\u000ainterpretation of test results.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"3879","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Before 2010, the chance of a foal being born with FIS in the Fell pony\u000d\u000a      breed was very high (up to 15-20%) as the carrier rate in breeding animals\u000d\u000a      was so high (40-44%), but carriers were not identifiable. Whilst the Dales\u000d\u000a      ponies had a lower carrier rate (20%), there was still real uncertainty\u000d\u000a      for breeders and owners and the very significant chance that a foal with\u000d\u000a      no chance of survival could be produced.\u000d\u000a    The principal impact of the research is the provision and deployment of a\u000d\u000a      carrier test for Foal Immunodeficiency Syndrome to eradicate this fatal\u000d\u000a      equine disease following the UoL's identification of the genetic defect in\u000d\u000a      2010 and deployment of the carrier test by two commercial laboratories (http:\/\/animaldnadiagnostics.co.uk;\u000d\u000a      www.aht.org.uk\/genetics_tests.html#equine).\u000a      This new diagnostic veterinary tool for risk-free breeding was immediately\u000d\u000a      offered to owners of the two most at-risk breeds (Fell and Dales ponies)\u000d\u000a      leading to rapid reductions in FIS rates.\u000d\u000a    In addition, the screening programme unexpectedly identified the spread\u000d\u000a      of the disease in two further breeds; Coloured ponies and Cob ponies.\u000d\u000a      Their breed societies have been informed about the presence of carriers in\u000d\u000a      their populations through dissemination of documentation prepared by\u000d\u000a      Carter and encouragement to use the test to ensure safe breeding.\u000d\u000a    The test was introduced in 2010. Peer reviewed analysis of the diagnostic\u000d\u000a      data in subsequent years, by Carter [1], clearly indicates a major\u000d\u000a      reduction in the numbers of FIS foals born since 2010, with only one FIS\u000d\u000a      foal born in 2012 in the UK. Owner education via concerted knowledge\u000d\u000a      exchange programmes has been a large part of the success of this work.\u000d\u000a      There is clear evidence from the Fell pony society of FIS-positive\u000d\u000a      stallions being gelded to prevent disease spread [7]. Feedback\u000d\u000a      (verifiable) from the two main breed societies shows that the carrier test\u000d\u000a      was readily welcomed and in some breeders' cases it may have saved their\u000d\u000a      financial viability [7,8]. The need for an effective carrier test can be\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the fact that more than half of all the UK breeding stock of\u000d\u000a      at risk ponies was tested in the first few months of the test being\u000d\u000a      available.

In addition to its significance for equine welfare, the data\u000d\u000a      clearly showed that FIS is a novel immunodeficiency providing insight into\u000d\u000a      mammalian immune system function.\u000d\u000a    Thomas (UoL PGR) examined stud books which showed that FIS has an\u000d\u000a      autosomal recessive genetic basis, explaining why affected foals were\u000d\u000a      being produced after matings of clinically normal mares and stallions\u000d\u000a      which were both FIS carriers. Thus, the mutated gene was spreading\u000d\u000a      undetected in the equine populations and there was every likelihood of it\u000d\u000a      being passed to other equine breeds by cross breeding. Carter reported the\u000d\u000a      first FIS case in Dales ponies (2009) and has detected carriers in two\u000d\u000a      more breeds subsequently. Prior to 2007, analysing genetic associations\u000d\u000a      with equine diseases was quite difficult because comprehensive tools were\u000d\u000a      not available. Once the equine genome became available, it was possible to\u000d\u000a      take a molecular genetic approach to identify what was likely to be a\u000d\u000a      small, but very deleterious change in equine DNA.\u000d\u000a    Utilising the equine genome, Fox-Clipsham (UoL PGR) identified\u000d\u000a      microsatellite markers that clearly indicated strong FIS linkage to\u000d\u000a      chromosome 26. The location of the aberrant genetic mutation was confirmed\u000d\u000a      and refined with a whole genome SNP array (Illumina) identifying 54,600\u000d\u000a      equine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enabling a genome wide\u000d\u000a      association study. This clearly identified a candidate region of 2.6Mb on\u000d\u000a      chromosome 26 which was captured and resequenced (GS FLX Titanium @ UoL).\u000d\u000a      Eight SNPs were identified in affected foals, narrowing the critical\u000d\u000a      region (to 0.3 Mb) and enabling Sanger sequencing which identified the one\u000d\u000a      SNP completely associated with FIS. A PCR test was developed in 2010 to\u000d\u000a      identify this SNP in samples and made available (commercially via the\u000d\u000a      Animal Health Trust (AHT), Newmarket) to owners to enable identification\u000d\u000a      of FIS carriers prior to breeding.\u000d\u000a    This work was entirely carried out by those named above at the UoL. Over\u000d\u000a      2,750 samples of horse DNA were screened to identify carriers and affected\u000d\u000a      foals.

A recent\u000a      systematic review on nutraceuticals for management of osteoarthritis in\u000a      dogs, cats and horses concluded that the evidence base for efficacy of\u000a      nutraceuticals in osteoarthritis was poor with the exception of omega-3\u000a      fatty acids in dogs which confirmed the significance of this UoL research\u000a      [6]. The use of a dietary additive has been shown to reduce the dose of\u000a      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) required by dogs with\u000a      osteoarthritis, reducing the likelihood of adverse events associated with\u000a      long-term NSAID use. The diet can considerably increase mobility [9].\u000a    The impact of the research since 2008 is best demonstrated by sales data\u000a      for Hill's Prescription Diet Canine j\/d which has been sold by Hill's\u000a      (subsidiary of Colgate) throughout the developed world since 2003. The\u000a      economic impact has increased steadily during the REF period (see table\u000a      below) through support from UoL researchers (lectures and published\u000a      reviews in North America and Europe, and research papers demonstrating the\u000a      efficacy of the product). This product, which is based on the UoL\u000a      research, has been assessed by independent investigators in a randomized\u000a      clinical trial of dogs with naturally-occurring osteoarthritis. This study\u000a      showed a significant increase (mean 5.6%) in peak vertical force (as\u000a      measured by a force platform) in the index limb in dogs receiving the j\/d\u000a      diet compared to dogs receiving a standard control diet (mean 0.4%),\u000a      thereby confirming the clinical efficacy of Hill's Prescription Diet\u000a      Canine j\/d for treatment of spontaneous canine osteoarthritis [7].\u000a    Sales of Hill's prescription diet Canine j\/d are only through veterinary\u000a      practices. As such, the product provides an income stream for both Hill's\u000a      Pet Nutrition, being their second best selling product) and the veterinary\u000a      profession in the developed world.

However, the largest charitable provider of veterinary\u000a    services in UK, the PDSA, has confirmed that in 2012, 3% of their pet food\u000a    orders were for Hill's Prescription Diet Canine j\/d [8]. As of 2013, Hill's\u000a    Prescription Diet Canine j\/d had been distributed to over 20 countries, the\u000a    top five markets being United States, France, Canada, United Kingdom, and\u000a    Denmark.\u000a    The Liverpool research has translated, during the REF period, to a\u000a      similar impact in cats with osteoarthritis, again through provision of a\u000a      diet (Hill's Prescription Diet Feline j\/d) specifically designed to\u000a      ameliorate this condition. The manufacturers claim a 61% improvement in\u000a      cats with moderate or severe osteoarthritis [13].\u000a    In summary, the identification by the UoL of the potential of EPA as\u000a      canine dietary additive has improved welfare for dogs internationally,\u000a      reduced distress for owners, enabled veterinarians to extend their\u000a      services, and generated business for a pet food company.\u000a    To further improve the diagnosis of canine osteoarthritis and to provide\u000a      a standardised quantitative monitoring of the degree of osteoarthritis,\u000a      the LOAD instrument has been licensed on a global basis from q4 2012 to\u000a      Novartis Animal Health as a psychometrically-validated tool for\u000a      veterinarians and dog-owners to use in the identification, diagnosis,\u000a      staging and monitoring of canine osteoarthritis. This is the first\u000a      validated CMI to be rolled out to the veterinary profession, the only one\u000a      that is (i) licensed to a pharmaceutical company, (ii) in electronic\u000a      format and (iii) available in five languages.

These studies identified the importance of aggrecanases in\u000a      spontaneous osteoarthritis in dogs [1]. Following a competitive process\u000a      for initial funding, a series of subsequent funding rounds were secured\u000a      from Hill's Nutrition Inc for a programme of work to investigate the\u000a      potential of dietary omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) to reduce the\u000a      activity of aggrecanases (ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5) in canine cartilage.\u000a      Using an in vitro canine cartilage degradation model, the group\u000a      (which included two jointly supervised PDRAs) demonstrated that\u000a      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly reduced the catabolic release of\u000a      glycosaminoglycan (GAG) from canine cartilage which had been stimulated\u000a      with catabolic cytokines interleukin-103b2 and oncostatin M. These\u000a      cytokines stimulate chondrocytes to synthesize catabolic enzymes, such as\u000a      aggrecanases, which degrade the extracellular matrix of cartilage (a\u000a      critical component of which is GAG). Western blotting of culture media for\u000a      products of GAG cleavage indicated that the reduction in GAG release was\u000a      as a result of a reduction in aggrecanase-generated catabolites in the\u000a      cartilage explants treated with EPA. Furthermore, gene expression analysis\u000a      of cartilage explants indicated that EFAs induced a reduction in\u000a      expression of the ADAMTS-5 gene. Other EFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)\u000a      and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), were shown not to have this beneficial\u000a      effect. Thus, the research clearly indicated that the presence of EPA in\u000a      the canine diet should reduce the progression or severity of\u000a      osteoarthritis.\u000a    These data were used in the initial US patent application [2]. The patent\u000a      applications protect the product Hill's Prescription Diet Canine j\/d (www.hillspet.co.uk).\u000a    Subsequent work at Liverpool (Innes, Vaughan-Thomas) and Cardiff\u000a      developed a feline cartilage degradation model [4] and similar findings\u000a      for EFAs supported the formulation of Hill's Prescription Diet Feline j\/d.\u000a    In parallel, Innes led research on the development of user-friendly,\u000a      client-administered clinical metrology instruments (CMIs) since diagnosis,\u000a      staging and assessing response to treatment in canine osteoarthritis are\u000a      challenging aspects of this disease for practising veterinarians.\u000a      Specifically, Innes has developed the `Liverpool Osteoarthritis in\u000a        Dogs' (`LOAD') CMI [5,6] through a systematic psychometric\u000a      validation process to provide data to underpin the use of such instruments\u000a      in canine veterinary practice [5,6]. Such a validation process required\u000a      testing for fact, content, construct and criterion validity as well as\u000a      reliability and responsiveness. Although there are five other CMIs for\u000a      chronic pain\/lameness\/arthritis in dogs in the peer-reviewed literature,\u000a      LOAD has been tested through the most extensive validation process and\u000a      thus can be considered the current market leader due to its uniquely\u000a      established 3 factor validation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3882","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research described here has changed substantially the fundamental\u000d\u000a      understanding of the mode of action of artificial sweeteners used in\u000d\u000a      animal nutrition. It is now understood that, rather than being a\u000d\u000a      non-specific `palatant', sweeteners such as SUCRAM at a small\u000d\u000a      concentration (0.015% w\/w) are potent activators (600-fold&gt;glucose) of\u000d\u000a      the intestinal glucose (sweet) sensor. This research, since 2008, has had\u000d\u000a      major impacts on the health and wellbeing of the animals concerned, as\u000d\u000a      well as having significant economic impacts on the pig production industry\u000d\u000a      and the animal feed company, Pancosma, with whom Prof Shirazi-Beechey\u000d\u000a      collaborates.\u000d\u000a    Economic Impacts\u000d\u000a    Post weaning mortality constitutes an on-going substantive financial loss\u000d\u000a      to the pig industry. Shirazi-Beechey's research has demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      sweeteners contribute to health maintenance and increased growth mainly\u000d\u000a      due to optimization of feed utilization. This has major economic benefits\u000d\u000a      for the animal industry as their return on investment is significantly\u000d\u000a      increased by the use of SUCRAM [9].\u000d\u000a    The novel mechanisms discovered have also enhanced customers'\u000d\u000a      understanding of the mode of action and benefits of artificial sweeteners\u000d\u000a      in piglet feed, thereby increasing the sale of SUCRAM. Since the\u000d\u000a      implementation of Shirazi-Beechey's research in 2008, annual sales have\u000d\u000a      more than doubled from &#8364;5.9m in 2008 to &#8364;12m in 2012; the largest demand\u000d\u000a      is in China, Brazil, South Korea, Thailand, Philippines, Spain, Russia,\u000d\u000a      Netherlands, Mexico, Italy, Japan and Indonesia. Shirazi- Beechey, in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Pancosma, has been pivotal in promoting the benefits of\u000d\u000a      SUCRAM to potential international customers in the animal feed industry,\u000d\u000a      creating a demand responsible for the increased sales figures [11]. The\u000d\u000a      benefits to animal breeders will be many times this, as the net return on\u000d\u000a      investment has been shown to be 400% of expenditure on SUCRAM [9]. The\u000d\u000a      importance of the role of sweeteners on pig gut development has received\u000d\u000a      wide industry recognition with high profile articles in pig industry\u000d\u000a      journals [10]. Global animal feed companies such as Cargill, Purina and CP\u000d\u000a      Group are incorporating SUCRAM into their products [7,8,12,13].\u000d\u000a    The partnership between Shirazi-Beechey and Pancosma has had additional\u000d\u000a      economic benefits to the Company that go beyond sales figures. Her\u000d\u000a      research has scientifically validated the Company's promotion of the\u000d\u000a      product; giving customer's the assurance that the decision to include\u000d\u000a      SUCRAM in their animal feed will have a quantifiable impact on their pig\u000d\u000a      production. Her research has also allowed the Company to remain\u000d\u000a      competitive in the animal feed industry, by helping to realign the\u000d\u000a      Company's values to focus more on science and research, rather than just\u000d\u000a      on production and sales. This is demonstrated in their updated motto,\u000d\u000a      \"Customer driven, science minded\", with a new Company focus on \"gut\u000d\u000a      health\" [11]. Their reputation as a world-leading, scientifically forward\u000d\u000a      Company has been significantly aided by Shirazi-Beechey's initiation and\u000d\u000a      organisation of annual meetings (Paris 2010; Paris 2011, Madrid 2012)\u000d\u000a      where topics relating to important research underpinning animal gut health\u000d\u000a      are presented and discussed. Audience members include scientists,\u000d\u000a      individuals from animal feed industries, EU regulators, policy makers,\u000d\u000a      administrators and valued customers [11].\u000d\u000a    These benefits would not have been achieved without the fundamental\u000d\u000a      insights into the underpinning molecular mechanisms. The global animal\u000d\u000a      feed company, Cargill, states that \"this is an excellent example of how\u000d\u000a      relatively `deep' science can have a very close connection with, and\u000d\u000a      impact on, practical animal agriculture.\" [7]. The knowledge that\u000d\u000a      artificial sweeteners trigger molecular pathways is leading to industrial\u000d\u000a      realisation that the research outputs are relevant to other major aspects\u000d\u000a      of agriculture, including the dairy industry [7,8].\u000d\u000a    Animal Welfare Benefits\u000d\u000a      Subsequent to research, a large number of field trials (involving more\u000d\u000a      than 4500 piglets) have indicated that the artificial sweetener, SUCRAM,\u000d\u000a      is effective, by over 90%, in reducing post weaning intestinal disorders,\u000d\u000a      leading to enhancement of growth and wellbeing of early weaned piglets.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of Liverpool (UoL) has identified a\u000d\u000a      new class of intestinal nutrient sensors that influence nutrient\u000d\u000a      absorption properties of agricultural species.

The UoL\u000d\u000a      research, all undertaken under the leadership of Professor Soraya\u000d\u000a      Shirazi-Beechey in the period 1998-2012, has investigated molecular\u000d\u000a      pathways controlling intestinal nutrient (glucose) absorption and gut\u000d\u000a      development.\u000d\u000a    Central to the research has been the intestinal glucose transporter\u000d\u000a      protein, Sodium\/GLucose Transporter 1,\u000d\u000a      SGLT1, which is the major route for absorption of glucose (and galactose)\u000d\u000a      from the lumen of the intestine into absorptive epithelial cells. Further,\u000d\u000a      glucose absorption by SGLT1 activates sodium chloride and water\u000d\u000a      absorption, restoring electrolyte balance and hydration.\u000d\u000a    The research showed that enhancement in expression of SGLT1 and the\u000d\u000a      capacity of the gut to absorb dietary monosaccharides is initiated by the\u000d\u000a      activation of a glucose sensor protein [1]. The identity of the sensor\u000d\u000a      molecule was discovered and showed to consist of two subunits, Taste\u000a      1 family Receptor 2 (T1R2) and 3 (T1R3),\u000d\u000a      expressed on the luminal membrane of enteroendocrine (sensor) cells [2]\u000d\u000a      leading to Shirazi-Beechey obtaining a patent (PCT\/EP2005\/054760).\u000d\u000a    The next phase of the UoL research investigated the potential role of the\u000d\u000a      T1R3 sub-unit and gustducin as components of the glucose sensor protein\u000d\u000a      using knockout mice (provided by RF Margolskee at Mt.

Work carried out at UoL showed\u000d\u000a      that wild-type mice fed a high carbohydrate diet had a several fold\u000d\u000a      increase in expression of SGLT1 mRNA, protein and function compared to\u000d\u000a      mice kept on a low carbohydrate diet. It was also found that artificial\u000d\u000a      sweeteners, when included in the diet, also increased SGLT1 expression.\u000d\u000a      However, in mice lacking either T1R3 or gustducin, neither the high\u000d\u000a      carbohydrate diet nor addition of artificial sweeteners had such effect\u000d\u000a      [3]. Further research demonstrated that activation of T1R2-T1R3 by\u000d\u000a      artificial sweeteners releases a gut hormone, glucagon-like peptide-2\u000d\u000a      (GLP-2), from the enteroendocrine cells, that stimulates intestinal growth\u000d\u000a      and gut maturity and enhances SGLT1 expression [3,4]. Hence, mechanisms\u000d\u000a      were identified that show how the addition of dietary artificial\u000d\u000a      sweeteners can enhance the absorption of glucose, salt, water and promote\u000d\u000a      intestinal cell growth.\u000d\u000a    These studies provided the basis for further research (2008-2012)\u000d\u000a      demonstrating that pig intestine, as well as the intestine of other\u000d\u000a      mammalian species [4,5,6] (except feline) [6], expresses\u000a      the sweet receptor, signalling elements and GLP-2, required for\u000d\u000a      upregulation of SGLT1 expression. Specifically, it has been shown that the\u000d\u000a      artificial sweetener SUCRAM, which consists of saccharin and neohesperidin\u000d\u000a      dihydrochalcone (NHDC), when included in the feed or the drinking water of\u000d\u000a      weaning piglets, enhances the expression of SGLT1, gut structural maturity\u000d\u000a      and the capacity to absorb glucose [5] (Pancosma commissioned\u000d\u000a      research, 2008-2010). Furthermore, current research (2010- ) in the\u000d\u000a      laboratory is demonstrating that maintaining piglets on the diet\u000d\u000a      containing SUCRAM can positively influence piglet's innate immunity due to\u000d\u000a      enhancement in gut population abundance of lactobacilli.\u000d\u000a    Postdoctoral fellows Dyer, Vayro, Daly, Moran and PhD students Salmon,\u000d\u000a      Arora, Batchelor, Zibrik and Al-Rammahi and the technician Coulter were\u000d\u000a      involved in the studies.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3902","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2395170","Name":"Benin"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Local crops are critical to feeding developing nations in Africa and\u000a      Asia, and also to earning precious foreign currency from exports that can\u000a      raise living standards. So when the larvae of pests such as diamondback\u000a      moth, cotton bollworm or armyworm literally eat their way through acres of\u000a      cereals and vegetables, it can devastate the livelihoods of many thousands\u000a      of people. Each of these global pests has been estimated to cost a billion\u000a      or more dollars annually. They have traditionally required expensive\u000a      chemical pesticides which cause environmental damage, and to which they\u000a      are increasingly resistant. The University of Greenwich has worked with\u000a      governments and local people to develop effective new biological\u000a      pesticides which can be produced cheaply and locally. It has guided\u000a      strategies to overcome barriers like inadequate national pesticide\u000a      registration policies and lack of pesticide production infrastructure. It\u000a      has shared the knowledge on how to use and produce the pesticides through\u000a      national and international training, and its control strategies are\u000a      becoming the norm in many countries. The Tanzanian government based its\u000a      armyworm control policy on the research, including new knowledge about\u000a      armyworm ecology which has enabled forecasting of outbreaks. The\u000a      university was also a partner in research that successfully developed\u000a      genetically modified (GM) brassicas to resist diamondback moth and other\u000a      pests in cabbage and cauliflower.\u000a    Impact has been achieved not only through new knowledge but also long\u000a      term capacity building of research partners in developing countries, and\u000a      new small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) who produce the\u000a      biopesticides. In India for instance, new viral insecticide production\u000a      took off after Grzywacz and local collaborators led training programmes\u000a      for 16 private and public sector institutions who went on to produce many\u000a      of the estimated 45 baculovirus insecticides registered in India since\u000a      2008 [5.1].\u000a    Research on developing better quality production of viruses in India led\u000a      to international guidelines for baculovirus quality and a training manual\u000a      in the techniques of baculovirus production and quality control. The\u000a      results on new virus production and formulation techniques were\u000a      disseminated actively through training courses for research institutes and\u000a      new SMEs in UK, India, Nepal, Kenya, Tanzania, Benin, Ghana and Bolivia;\u000a      they have been disseminated world-wide since 2010 by the UN Food &amp;\u000a      Agricultural Organisation [5.2]. Private company Kenya Biologics was set\u000a      up in 2009, following research into baculoviruses in Kenya, to produce two\u000a      new biopesticides now undergoing registration. After training received in\u000a      2000-01, River Bioscience developed new baculovirus insecticides which\u000a      have been on sale in South Africa since 2008 and are currently undergoing\u000a      registration in other African countries.\u000a    Research with Thailand Department of Agriculture led to establishment of\u000a      a biopesticide company in 2008 and local production of insecticides to\u000a      control horticultural crop pests including Helicoverpa armigera\u000a      and S. exigua. This company now produces four new baculovirus\u000a      insecticides with a capacity to treat up to 30,000 ha of high value export\u000a      crops. Farmers can control these pests without chemical residues, allowing\u000a      them to export to EU, a market worth &gt;$50 million a year.\u000a    The diamondback moth research under the CIMBAA project developed insect\u000a      resistant brassicas for Africa and Asia. A new Australian\u000a      Government-funded project (valued at $2.9 million) has now taken up the\u000a      outputs of this research to deploy the technology in India, Africa and\u000a      Australasia to control a pest estimated to cause losses of &gt;$2 billion\u000a      per annum [5.3].\u000a    The Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture's current policy of promoting\u000a      armyworm virus for African armyworm control in place of chemical pesticide\u000a      is based on the Tanzanian research [5.4]. The DFID Safe and Affordable\u000a      Armyworm Control Tools project has part funded the building of a\u000a      biopesticides plant by a Tanzanian company which became operational in\u000a      April 2013 [5.5]. The project also established the village community-based\u000a      forecasting system that has set up armyworm pheromone forecasting traps in\u000a      120 locations and is now operational in Kenya and Tanzania. It is\u000a      estimated to benefit 80,000 farmers in Kenya and 25,000 in Tanzania [5.5,\u000a      5.6].\u000a    Few African countries had a pesticide registration system that recognised\u000a      biopesticides before 2003. Grzywacz helped the Kenyan authorities develop\u000a      a new system, adopted as law in 2008; since then over 35 biopesticide\u000a      products have been registered. Kenya's horticultural industry has\u000a      benefitted from new biopesticide products which ensure its exports to EU\u000a      continue to meet strict pesticide residue standards. An estimated two\u000a      million Kenyans are dependent upon this sector. Grzywacz also advised the\u000a      Ghana Environmental Protection agency on a biopesticides registration\u000a      system which was adopted; the first commercial BV biopesticide, produced\u000a      in Kenya, was registered in Ghana in June 2012 with Grzywacz as technical\u000a      advisor.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research and knowledge dissemination led by Greenwich on biological\u000a      pesticides has made a major contribution to the introduction of novel safe\u000a      commercial pesticides based on insect viruses to help farmers overcome the\u000a      problems of chemical resistance in major crop pests in Asia and Africa.\u000a      Research at Greenwich identified effective virus strains, methods of\u000a      production and formulation which were then developed and evaluated with in\u000a      country research collaborators before being transferred to local SMEs to\u000a      start up production in India, Thailand, Kenya and Tanzania.

They are\u000a      especially difficult to control in tropical Asia and Africa where\u000a      pesticide resistance is most widespread. From subsistence farmers and\u000a      their governments who cannot afford chemical insecticides, to the\u000a      exporters of horticultural crops who must meet demanding EU pesticide\u000a      residue standards banning many chemicals, populations in developing\u000a      countries need alternative control methods.\u000a    Research from 1994-2004 on baculoviruses pathogenic to these pests, led\u000a      by David Grzywacz, Principal Scientist at Greenwich, has generated key\u000a      knowledge that has underpinned the development of new commercial\u000a      insecticides. A research programme has collected, genetically\u000a      characterised and evaluated the baculoviruses of Spodoptera exigua, S.\u000a        littoralis, S. litura, S. exempta, H. armigera and P. xylostella\u000a      through a long term programme of collaborative research with India,\u000a      Thailand, Nepal, Kenya, Tanzania, Benin and Ghana. The research\u000a      (1994-2004) developed efficient production and quality control systems\u000a      suitable for production in developing countries, as well as studying\u000a      efficacy and persistence of different formulations on target crops\u000a      [3.1-3.3]. Fieldwork in India (1998-2004) also identified the issue of\u000a      limited persistence of baculoviruses on some legume crops. This has been\u000a      shown to be due to the plants' secretion of isoflavenoid phytochemicals\u000a      that directly inactivates the insect baculoviruses [3.4]: the first\u000a      published record of such a host-pathogen interaction.\u000a    Grzywacz was invited to join a private-public research partnership, the\u000a      Collaboration on Insect Management for Brassicas for Africa and Asia\u000a      (CIMBAA) [3.5] because of his research on diamondback moth. This &#8364;10\u000a      million collaboration between the universities of Greenwich, Cornell and\u000a      Melbourne, and Bayer Crop Science, successfully developed GM\u000a      insect-resistant brassicas, based on two previously unused Bt genes,\u000a      CryICa4 and Cry1Ba2, as a more sustainable brassica pest solution during\u000a      2004-10. The University of Greenwich, under Derek Russell, Principal\u000a      Scientist (1994-2012) and Grzywacz, led the public sector partners in the\u000a      project, and the field research that selected and demonstrated the\u000a      efficacy of the new GM cabbage and cauliflower for controlling DBM and\u000a      other major pests of cabbage and cauliflower in India [3.6]. In 2012\u000a      Russell left the University of Greenwich to lead a new Australian $2.9\u000a      million project to deploy this technology in Asia, Africa and Australasia.\u000a    The university led the research (1996-2005) on control of African\u000a      armyworm which identified, developed and evaluated the armyworm\u000a      nucleopolyhedrovirus as an effective control [3.2].

Research outputs and validation pilots\u000a      undertaken by Professor Westby and team have been widely used. A key\u000a      example is the pan-African project, Cassava: Adding Value for Africa\u000a      (C:AVA). Its aim is to develop smallholder-supplied high quality cassava\u000a      flour (HQCF) and related product value chains, e.g. dried fufu.\u000a      Success has been predicated on adopting a value chain approach and\u000a      adapting technologies to support intermediary and end user companies; this\u000a      has created sustainable value chains that have generated social, economic\u000a      and policy benefits, with significant reach and depth of impact,\u000a      especially benefitting women and other disadvantaged groups.\u000a    C:AVA impacts\u000a    Based on monitoring data reported to the Bill and Melinda Gates\u000a      Foundation, C:AVA has:\u000a    - Established value chains for HQCF and related products in Nigeria,\u000a      Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi, with annual increases in HQCF\u000a      production.\u000a    - Supported 51 small-medium scale enterprises, three associations and 89\u000a      village processing groups to process HQCF. These include 25 factories in\u000a      Nigeria including Oamsal, Wahan Food and Walili Mata; six in Ghana\u000a      including Caltech Ventures, First Door and Amasa Agroprocessing; three\u000a      associations in Uganda; and seven companies in Malawi including Universal\u000a      Industries Limited; 20 community processing groups and three enterprises\u000a      in Tanzania, e.g. Kejo Enterprises.\u000a    - Supported local engineering companies (for example, Nobex Technical\u000a      Company, Nigeria) that have developed improved processing equipment to\u000a      support the expanding demand for HQCF.\u000a    - Generated in excess of 42,616 tonnes of HQCF between April 2008 and\u000a      March 2013, with 23,695 tonnes produced in 2012\/2013 alone.\u000a    - Benefitted over 90,000 smallholder farmers; they are estimated to\u000a      benefit by $33.0 million as a consequence of project activities by\u000a      31\/3\/2014.\u000a    - Increased incomes will be determined in impact surveys in 2014, but are\u000a      estimated, based on monitoring data, to be in the range of $310-370 per\u000a      smallholder.\u000a    - Surveys indicate that women involved in C:AVA have:\u000a    \u000a      enhanced technical and management skills;\u000a      benefitted from labour saving technologies;\u000a      new employment opportunities, increased incomes and greater dietary\u000a        diversity;\u000a      increased independence.\u000a    \u000a    - Promoted the development of instant fufu as a commercial\u000a      product in Ghana and Nigeria, produced by companies such as Sunshine\u000a      Foods, Ayoola Food and Ubest Industries.\u000a    - Supported commercial companies to adopt HQCF. These include:\u000a    \u000a      plywood manufacturers in Ghana, e.g. Western Veneer and Lumbar\u000a        Company, Kumasi;\u000a      paperboard manufacturers in Uganda, e.g. Katon Industries, and Malawi,\u000a        e.g. Packaging Industries Malawi Limited;\u000a      local bakeries and food manufacturing companies in all countries eg\u000a        Rite Foods, Nigeria; Universal Foods, Malawi, and Britannia Foods,\u000a        Uganda.\u000a    \u000a    Impact has generated change at the individual level beyond direct\u000a      sales. For example, Zainabu Akol from Uganda used her income from higher\u000a      cassava production and sales to buy poultry. The poultry manure increased\u000a      production from her orange garden and cattle were bought from the cassava\u000a      and orange sales (her story is here at 13:45 minutes: http:\/\/cava.nri.org\/multimedia\/44-\u000a          videos\/47-video-gallery). In Malawi, Mrs Melia, a food\u000a      processor, used HQCF as a wheat flour replacement to produce mandazis\u000a      which generated more profit that she aims to invest in a start-up clothing\u000a      business.\u000a    At group level, technical and management skills have been\u000a      enhanced, for example in Tanzania by the Ukumbozi village processors'\u000a      group which has 31 members, 18 of whom are women. After training, the\u000a      quantity and quality of HQCF production increased, and new processing\u000a      equipment relieved the drudgery of processing. C:AVA facilitated links to\u000a      an intermediary and the group now has an assured market with an agri-food\u000a      processing company, which also provides credit. The lessons learned and\u000a      success achieved by C:AVA has informed Nigeria's Cassava Transformation\u000a      Agenda and hence national policy and strategy. C:AVA teams have\u000a      made inputs in the cassava sector in Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda and Malawi.\u000a    C:AVA success has generated further interest from the Bill and Melinda\u000a      Gates Foundation and other donors. The Department for International\u000a      Development has adopted the C:AVA project approach in its AgriTT pilot\u000a      project to develop cassava value chains in Uganda, using Chinese\u000a      technologies. The Gates Foundation is looking to invest a further $18\u000a      million in a second phase of C:AVA under African leadership; the vision is\u000a      that within eight years, at least 250,000 smallholders will have sold at\u000a      least $400 million of roots into value chains.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The tropical root crop, cassava, is a food security crop for 450 million\u000a      people in Africa.

Cassava is strategically important as a food source and famine\u000a      reserve, combining high calorific efficiency with versatile low cost\/input\u000a      and reliable and flexible production; it is also seen as a pro-poor\u000a      vehicle for economic development. However farmers, particularly from\u000a      remote areas, have restricted market access because the roots are highly\u000a      perishable, bulky and expensive to transport. In addition, there are\u000a      potential food safety issues associated with cyanide-containing compounds\u000a      and mycotoxins in dried products.\u000a    Andrew Westby, Professor of Food Technology (1987 to present), and his\u000a      team at the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich,\u000a      have been at the forefront of strategic and adaptive research on the\u000a      intrinsic properties of cassava and its transformation to make safe, cheap\u000a      and valued products that bring value to farmers and others in the supply\u000a      chain.\u000a    Westby, Bainbridge (1996-2001) and co-workers aimed to produce safe and\u000a      shelf-stable products. Research (1994-1998) on the breakdown of cyanogenic\u000a      compounds during processing used methods developed at NRI [3b] and focused\u000a      on the importance of tissue disruption in cyanogen reduction [3.1, 3.3].\u000a      This paved the way for adaptive research for cyanogen reduction during\u000a      processing (drying and various types of fermentation). Research [3c, 3.6]\u000a      (1993-1995) by Wareing (1988-2001) and Westby isolated and characterised\u000a      mycotoxins from cassava products and showed that:\u000a    a) cassava could support the production of a wide range of mycotoxins,\u000a      including sterigmatocystin, neosolaniol, cyclopiazonic acid and\u000a      diacetoxyscirpenol;\u000a    b) these could be isolated from traditionally processed products;\u000a    c) consumers preferred non-mouldy products.\u000a    These findings led to research on the development of drying regimes that\u000a      prevented mould growth and mycotoxin production, which improved product\u000a      quality and consumers' health and were readily suited to small and\u000a      medium-scale enterprises.\u000a    Development of techniques to produce a safer product was crucial in\u000a      taking forward a cluster of research projects between 1999 and 2006 by\u000a      Westby, Tomlins (1987 to present) and Graffham (1993 to present). This\u000a      research had funding from the UK Government and the European Commission to\u000a      develop and commercialise cassava processing systems and products in order\u000a      to maximise benefits and sustain rural livelihoods [3a, 3d]. It took\u000a      holistic approaches and a strong market-demand focus [3.2]. Strategic and\u000a      adaptive research on processing of cassava was integrated with value chain\u000a      studies, consumer acceptability [3.5] and systems analysis to determine\u000a      the institutional arrangements to improve market access and achieve impact\u000a      at a pilot level.\u000a    In particular, research has created improved processing technologies to\u000a      produce high quality cassava chips or flour - the flour usually\u000a      substituting for imported wheat, [3d, 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h] and improved\u000a      traditional products, e.g. fufu [3f, 3h]. Adaptive research was\u000a      completed to understand and optimise the use of high quality cassava\u000a      flours in paperboard, plywood adhesives, sugar syrups and other food uses\u000a      [3g].\u000a    In 2007, the Department for International Development's Research into\u000a        Use Programme published case studies summarising the above and its\u000a      validation.

Prior to 2006 there was no cohesive international effort\u000d\u000aon the environmental hazards of nanomaterials. Our impact has been to help establish a new\u000d\u000ascientific community on nano-ecotoxicology\/chemistry involving government, industry, consultancy\u000d\u000aand academia; building and developing a consensus view on hazard, fate, and effects. An early\u000d\u000aconsensus report was deliberately published independently, i.e., not from any one governmental\u000d\u000aregulatory agency or industry, as an unbiased view from the grass-roots scientific community.\u000d\u000aThrough our invitation by the Office of the President of the United States to act as an external\u000d\u000aadvisor to the US National Nanoscience (NNI) funding initiative, we were able to influence the\u000d\u000aEuropean Commission in establishing the NanoSafety Cluster, and Handy was instrumental in\u000d\u000asetting up the US-EU ``cores of research' aimed at international data sharing. A further consensus\u000d\u000areport involving the SETAC Nano-advisory group was published in 2012.\u000d\u000aAs a result of these seminal reports and the emergence of the new scientific discipline of nano-ecotoxicology,\u000d\u000awe were invited to prepare a report for DEFRA on test methods for nanomaterials\u000d\u000athat set out the validation problems around testing nanomaterials. This showed that the UK\/EU\u000d\u000ahazard assessment strategy urgently needed modification, and was subsequently used by DEFRA\u000d\u000ato argue the case for testing strategies with the EU Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials\u000d\u000a(WPMN). As a result, the international community has agreed that there is a problem with testing\u000d\u000amethods and an international sponsorship programme of testing by the OECD was commissioned\u000d\u000ainvolving members of the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO).Our impact has\u000d\u000aincluded OECD guidance documents. This reported in 2012. In the UK, this work and a paper by\u000d\u000aOwen and Handy (2007) raised nanoscience as a priority research funding issue; leading to a\u000d\u000aNational Nanoscience call from NERC led by Owen, and with Handy on the UK task force.\u000d\u000aSubsequently, the testing method issues were included in the Framework 7 call in Europe. Our\u000d\u000aresearch and consensus-building report was used in a 2010 Report by the Australian Department\u000d\u000aof the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts;. and in Reports from the Royal Commission on\u000d\u000aEnvironmental Pollution (2008),) and the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee\u000d\u000a(2010).\u000d\u000aThe regulatory testing activities that have emerged from this work are directed at Governments\u000d\u000aacross the EU and North America who are required to implement the regulatory process enabling\u000d\u000athe registration of new products, and industry now has official guidance on how to collect data to\u000d\u000asupport their product registrations. This is an absolute requirement as registration of new products\u000d\u000a(such as nano crop protection products) cannot proceed without the appropriate testing dossier.\u000d\u000aSpecifically, our research and testing methods have been used in a Report by the Dutch Food and\u000d\u000aEnvironmental Safety Agency (2009) and in official guidance documents on test methods from the\u000d\u000aOECD, and our expertise has led to our direct involvement in writing regulatory guidelines (OECD,\u000d\u000a2010; 2012). These documents are shared in the US by ISO, and so the impact of our knowledge\u000d\u000ais global across both government and industry. This application of our technical knowledge is on-going\u000d\u000aat the OECD, and we are providing technical advice to several sub-committees (SG3, SG7)\u000d\u000aand on specific materials (OECD programme for TiO2). The above regulatory activities disseminate\u000d\u000ainformation to industry through WPMN documents from the OECD, and from our reports to DEFRA\u000d\u000alocally in the UK.\u000d\u000aOne concern identified by us was a UK\/EU skills shortage to support industrial growth of the\u000d\u000aagri-food\/chemicals nanotechnology sectors and we were commissioned by DEFRA to write a\u000d\u000areport on the skills gap (Handy et al., 2009). This has had a wide impact on training policy in the\u000d\u000aUK. Our findings were presented to the Science Minister (David Willets MP) at the Department of\u000d\u000aBusiness, Innovation and Skills (BIS) meeting on 11th May 2011, and then in a closed meeting with\u000d\u000athe Chief Scientist's Committee. Evidence on hazards has also been presented to the UK\u000d\u000aGovernment, House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee with respect to food safety\u000d\u000a(via Prof Stephen Holgate). This further informed discussions with DEFRA on training and the Life\u000d\u000aScience Action Plan in the UK, so that training in nanoscience is now included (ACHS, 2011).\u000d\u000aOur research also had impact with DEFRA's Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances,\u000d\u000awhere we contributed evidence to decisions on allowing the granting of authorisation for the first\u000d\u000acommercial use of nano products for aquaculture in the UK.

This team led by Professor\u000d\u000aRichard Handy has been supported by several NERC grants, EU FP7 projects (NanoImpactNet,\u000d\u000aMARINA), an RCUK Fellowship (Henry, 2008-2013), and studentships from NERC (Ramsden,\u000d\u000a2009-2012) and the Iraq Ministry for Higher Education (Al-Bairuty, Al-Jubory 2009-2013). Key post-doctoral\u000d\u000astaff included Boyle (2009-2012) and Shaw (2006-present, currently on EU FP7 MARINA).\u000d\u000aThe research includes first reports on changes in locomotion\/behaviour and brain injury (Boyle\u000d\u000aet al., 2012; Al-Bairuty et al., 2012), the first proper dietary uptake study in fishes (Ramsden et al.,\u000d\u000a2009), reports of no effect levels for dietary exposure (Fraser et al., 2010), and experiments\u000d\u000acomparing the toxicity of nano-forms of metals with dissolved metals (Shaw et al., 2012). The latter\u000d\u000atwo issues are especially important. The absence of effects is sometimes not considered\u000d\u000aacademically interesting, but such information is absolutely vital for establishing safe levels in the\u000d\u000aenvironment\/food chain. Comparisons with existing substances (dissolved metals) are also critical\u000d\u000afor regulatory decision making in order to know whether nanomaterials can be captured by existing\u000d\u000alegislation or require policy development.\u000d\u000aOur research set out hypotheses on bioavailability\/absorption mechanisms (Handy et al.,\u000d\u000a2008b) and tested these experimentally, including the first paper on titanium dioxide absorption\u000d\u000aacross the gut (Al-Jubory and Handy, 2012). Together the findings provide a rational basis for\u000d\u000aconsidering key triggers in environmental risk assessment such as persistence and\u000d\u000abioaccumulation potential. They also provide information on the human health risk (e.g., brain\u000d\u000ainjury), and on food chain hazards to humans through agricultural usage.\u000d\u000aOur dietary exposure studies have shown that fish will readily eat food containing\u000d\u000ananomaterials and will grow normally (a manageable hazard for the aquaculture industry), and\u000d\u000amost nanomaterials so far tested do not accumulate in the edible muscle, meaning a low risk of\u000d\u000aexposure for humans eating fish. In the previous absence of approved methods for detecting\u000d\u000ananomaterials in fish\/shellfish our research has developed new methods for routine use in the food\u000d\u000aand agriculture industries (Patent application No: 1207745.9, May 2012 for the detection of TiO2).\u000d\u000aOne major obstacle to the safe, responsible innovation of nanotechnology in agriculture is the\u000d\u000avalidation of regulatory tests; without these tests companies cannot register their nano-products in\u000d\u000athe EU or USA. Our research has worked on validating individual regulatory ecotoxicity tests,\u000d\u000aproviding the evidence base and recommendations for altering the overarching testing strategy in\u000d\u000aEurope, and has provided the tools that Government(s)\/industry urgently need for risk assessment.\u000d\u000aWe have led several international working groups on test methods for nanoparticles (Handy et al.,\u000d\u000a2012a; 2012b), identified conceptual flaws in current bioaccumulation tests (Handy et al., 2012a),\u000d\u000aand provided a critique of terrestrial tests that support agricultural usage.

Such demands have led to the\u000a      installation of improved soil\u000a      physics apparatus at Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, which now monitors\u000a      sample shrinkage\u000a      during the measurements of the water retention characteristic.\u000a    The software has found resonance with commercial companies and\u000a      researchers alike and through\u000a      sale and use of the software, commercial impact has been made, much of\u000a      which is confidential to\u000a      clients. Clients include fundamental agricultural researchers such as\u000a      Rothamsted Research and\u000a      climate modellers at the Met Office. Furthermore the software technology\u000a      is proving to be\u000a      transferable from agricultural soils to all meso- and macro-porous\u000a      material with industrial\u000a      applications including high performance paper coatings (e.g. the next\u000a      generation of Hewlett\u000a      Packard ink-jet papers, with designed coatings supplied by Omya AG),\u000a      stainless steel filters for\u000a      aeronautical and military applications (Porvair Filtration), soil\u000a      structure under clover and terrestrial\u000a      nitrous oxide production (Rothamsted Research, BBSRC), leakage of\u000a      pollutant oil through soil\u000a      (British Gas and Transco), catalysts (Johnson-Matthey), porous ceramics\u000a      (Delta-T Devices), oil\u000a      reservoir sandstones (British Gas and British Petroleum), security systems\u000a      for bank note transport\u000a      (Spinnaker International) and gas mask filters (Questair). Major Energy\u000a      Companies, such as EDF,\u000a      are utilising it and have invested in both its development and\u000a      exploitation. The approach is also\u000a      now being used to up-scale soil hydrophobicity transitions to a level\u000a      which are being incorporated\u000a      into the Meteorological Office JULES climate-change dependant hydrological\u000a      model\u000a      (NE\/K004212\/1).\u000a    The cross-disciplinary applicability of this research is illustrated by\u000a      the example of its impact in the\u000a      paper industry. Paper is coated to increase its brightness, improve\u000a      printing characteristics, and\u000a      generally improve its perceived quality for magazines and photographs.\u000a      Whereas paper coatings\u000a      used to be made from China Clay, the best modern coatings are made from\u000a      calcium carbonate.\u000a      The EFMG has been collaborating with Omya AG for several years to design\u000a      `dual porous' paper\u000a      coatings - i.e. coatings made from micron-sized particles which themselves\u000a      have their own internal\u000a      nano-porosity. These paper coatings are now being used by Hewlett Packard\u000a      for fast, high quality\u000a      inkjet printing, which will ultimately entirely replace traditional offset\u000a      litho printing.\u000a    The research has also developed to have impact on major energy companies\u000a      such as EDF. The\u000a      lifetimes of the UK's AGR reactors are primarily governed by the rate at\u000a      which the Gilsocarbon\u000a      graphite in the reactor cores is oxidised, and loses mass, under the\u000a      conditions of intense radiation\u000a      and heat. This oxidation occurs despite the graphite being bathed in\u000a      carbon dioxide - a normally\u000a      reducing gas. EDF's own Finite Element Analysis model cannot explain the\u000a      ageing process,\u000a      because it depends on the pore architecture within the graphite. EDF has\u000a      invested in\u000a      approximately &#163;200k of applied research at Plymouth to elucidate this\u000a      structure. Unexpectedly, the\u000a      research has been as much experimental as modelling, because of the\u000a      demands of the software.\u000a      It has already influenced the approach of EDF to the prediction of the\u000a      ageing \/ mass loss rate, and\u000a      is being built into the Safety Case to the Office for Nuclear Regulation\u000a      for the extended running of\u000a      specific AGRs. Work on Gilsocarbon for EDF requires the separation of\u000a      actual mercury intrusion\u000a      from apparent mercury intrusion due to the destruction of the void\u000a      network, and this can only be\u000a      measured if a cyclic pressure cycle is used. Thermo Fisher is\u000a      reprogramming the firmware and\u000a      software for the Pascal porosimeter it has installed at Plymouth, and this\u000a      modification will is being\u000a      made available for all customers during 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study outlines how research at Plymouth University in soil\u000a      science has been extended to\u000a      a new way of measuring and characterising porous solids and their pore\u000a      fluids by generating\u000a      realistic simulated three-dimensional void networks and is now being used\u000a      across a wide range of\u000a      industry sectors.

The standard\u000a      implicit approximation, the capillary bundle model, still prevalent in the\u000a      research literature but\u000a      unrealistic for nearly all porous materials, is to assume that the pores\u000a      are like a bundle of very\u000a      narrow drinking straws, all of different sizes but not connected to each\u000a      other. The EFMG has\u000a      developed a method of constructing simulations containing\u000a      three-dimensionally interconnected\u000a      voids, which match the water retention characteristics of soil, or the\u000a      mercury intrusion\u000a      characteristics of other materials (Matthews et al., 2006). The capillary\u000a      bundle approximation is\u000a      even worse for porous materials which comprise an interconnected network\u000a      of small pores (meso-\u000a      porosity) connected throughout into matrices of even smaller pores\u000a      (micro-porosity). Important\u000a      examples of such `dual porous' materials are soil, high performance paper\u000a      coatings, and the\u000a      graphite, known as Gilsocarbon, used in the UK's 14 Advanced Gas Cooled\u000a      nuclear reactors. The\u000a      method of constructing a model of such dual-porous pore systems is common\u000a      to all such materials,\u000a      but is mathematically very complicated and experimentally very demanding\u000a      to measure. A major\u000a      development of the dual porous approach was funded by the BBSRC's &#163;1.1m\u000a      Soil Programme for\u000a      Quality and Resilience (BB\/E001793\/1), of which Matthews was overall\u000a      project leader (P.I.). The\u000a      mathematically demanding method of construction is common to all dual\u000a      porous materials\u000a      (Laudone et al 2013). Current developments for soil involve including\u000a      hydrophobicity (NERC\u000a      NE\/K004212\/1, &#163;0.9m, Matthews as P.I.) and modelling nitrate pools (BBSRC\u000a      BB\/K001566\/1,\u000a      &#163;0.4m, Matthews as Co.I.). It has just been described in a special issue\u000a      of the European Journal of\u000a      Soil Science (Laudone et al, 2013.)\u000a    Once the void structure has been simulated, it is sufficiently realistic\u000a      and quantitatively matched to\u000a      the dual porous material that it can be used for many other purposes\u000a      (Gribble et al., 2011). For\u000a      example, Laudone et al (2011) have used it to determine the distance\u000a      between the micro-biological\u000a      `hotspots' in soil that reduce the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, from the\u000a      main flow pathways\u000a      through the soil. This distance is critical to the way in which the\u000a      bacteria protect themselves from\u000a      flooding or drought, and is pertinent to the agricultural management of\u000a      soils to reduce nitrous oxide\u000a      emissions.\u000a    With regard to porous matrix paper coatings, the modelling approach has\u000a      been used by Omya AG\u000a      to develop dual porous paper coating formulations. The macro-porosity\u000a      allows rapid movement of\u000a      ink, and the capillarity (suction) of the micro-porosity ensures very fast\u000a      adsorption and drying in\u000a      very fast, large scale ink-jet printing machines which will soon take over\u000a      entirely from offset-litho.\u000a    An understanding of the pore structure of Gilsocarbon is critical in\u000a      being able to predict the\u000a      radiolytic oxidation, and hence mass loss, within the UK's AGR nuclear\u000a      reactors. The owners,\u000a      EDF, wish to obtain an extra 9 years of life for each of its reactors\u000a      beyond their planned lifetimes,\u000a      and are funding a &#163;200k research programme at Plymouth to measure and\u000a      model future mass loss\u000a      within the reactor cores.\u000a    The software `PoreXpert' is now being marketed and sold through the\u000a      Plymouth University spin-out\u000a      company PoreXpert Ltd. Two patents have been filed to protect areas of\u000a      intellectual property not\u000a      already published in the scientific literature.

However, these acids\u000d\u000a      degrade during high temperature roasting.\u000d\u000a    Identifying the potential value of a coffee product rich in chlorogenic\u000d\u000a      acids, Nestl&#233;, the world's largest food company, launched a research\u000d\u000a      programme in 2004 led by Gary Williamson (then Head of Nutrient\u000d\u000a      Bioavailability at the Nestl&#233; Research Center). The programme was set up\u000d\u000a      to support Nestl&#233;'s new pipeline product Green Blend, which contains a mix\u000d\u000a      of green and roasted coffee.\u000d\u000a    The research aimed to investigate the bioavailability of antioxidant\u000d\u000a      compounds in coffee and to study their metabolic pathways and functions in\u000d\u000a      organisms. This research effort was extended when Williamson moved\u000d\u000a      in January 2007 to UoL to take up the position of Chair of Functional\u000d\u000a      Foods in the School of Food Science and Nutrition. UoA6 was awarded a\u000d\u000a      grant of &#163;600,000 by Nestl&#233; for collaborative research on phenolic\u000d\u000a      bioavailability, led by Williamson, who was employed part-time (20\u000d\u000a      %) by Nestl&#233; until June 2012, at which point he become a full-time UoL\u000d\u000a      employee. Much of the research described below was performed at UoL, as\u000d\u000a      well as at the Nestl&#233; Research Center, demonstrating the strong linkage\u000d\u000a      between the two organisations and their two-way influence on the research\u000d\u000a      programme and methodologies.\u000d\u000a    The first research period (2007-2011) revealed how several naturally\u000d\u000a      occurring phenolic conjugates from coffee are taken up by the body after\u000d\u000a      coffee ingestion and how these, after absorption and metabolism, may\u000d\u000a      interact with key sites of the human organism when part of a normal diet.\u000d\u000a      The studies were carried out to resemble physiological conditions and the\u000d\u000a      average consumption of the drink as closely as possible (see details\u000d\u000a      below).\u000d\u000a    Bioavailability of chlorogenic acids in coffee\u000d\u000a    Research by Williamson and co-workers in Leeds and F. Dionisi at\u000d\u000a      Nestl&#233;, used HPLC to analyze for the first time chemical and enzymatic\u000d\u000a      synthesis of coffee-derived metabolites and revealed that metabolism of\u000d\u000a      chlorogenic acids involves several hydrolysis and conjugation reactions\u000d\u000a      which produce phenolic derivatives. The work in Leeds was the first to\u000d\u000a      successfully measure these phenolic conjugates in biological fluids [1].\u000d\u000a      (The chemical syntheses in this work were carried out by D. Barron\u000d\u000a      (Nestl&#233;)).\u000d\u000a    Williamson continued to conduct work in Leeds to elucidate the\u000d\u000a      pathways of metabolism for the phenolic conjugates, identifying the\u000d\u000a      important contribution made by the gut microflora on absorption and hence\u000d\u000a      bioavailability [2]. Complementary collaborative studies led by Professor\u000d\u000a      Alan Crozier at the University of Glasgow looked at the bioavailability of\u000d\u000a      chlorogenic acids from coffee in people who had had their small intestine\u000d\u000a      removed. As indicated by the published papers, in general Crozier focused\u000d\u000a      on identification, Williamson on quantification. These studies\u000d\u000a      revealed that the microflora increases absorption of coffee phenolics,\u000d\u000a      helping to explain the variety of observed mechanisms by which the body\u000d\u000a      handles different xenobiotic compounds (i.e., those not produced by\u000d\u000a      humans) contained within foods [3].\u000d\u000a    Comparison of coffee and tea\u000d\u000a    Between 2007 and 2011, Williamson collated published data from\u000d\u000a      the scientific literature and results from UoL experimental studies for a\u000d\u000a      critical and quantitative evaluation of how much antioxidant chlorogenic\u000d\u000a      acids and their metabolic derivatives were taken up by humans from a\u000d\u000a      single dose (i.e., one cup of coffee or tea). Based on average uptake\u000d\u000a      calculated from the data, Williamson was able to conclude that\u000d\u000a      uptake of phenolics from coffee is 70% higher than from green tea on a\u000d\u000a      molar basis, even though both of these drinks contain approximately the\u000d\u000a      same quantity of total phenolics, published in 2011 [4]. Williamson\u000d\u000a      carried out the bulk of the literature and data analysis, with\u000d\u000a      contributions from Dionisi and Renouf at the Nestl&#233; Research Center. Williamson\u000d\u000a      was invited to publish his review in the peer-reviewed journal Molecular\u000a        Nutrition and Food Research.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6419","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Most pregnant women in the UK and elsewhere consume caffeine from one or\u000d\u000a      more sources yet before the current work the evidence of any harm to the\u000d\u000a      fetus was inconclusive and a level at which harm may occur was unclear.\u000d\u000a    The CARE study overcame several limitations seen in previous studies.

For example, affected individuals have an increased\u000d\u000a      incidence of metabolic syndrome, manifesting as obesity, hypertension,\u000d\u000a      hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.\u000d\u000a    Clearly, reducing the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality through\u000d\u000a      impact on birthweight is important for the long-term health and survival\u000d\u000a      of every child.[B]\u000d\u000a    These results meant that for the first time women could be provided with\u000d\u000a      clear evidence and advice to reduce their caffeine intake before\u000d\u000a      conception and during the whole of pregnancy.\u000d\u000a    Further analysis led by Greenwood and published in 2010 showed a strong\u000d\u000a      link between caffeine consumption in the first trimester and late\u000d\u000a      miscarriage and stillbirth, further proving the harm associated with\u000d\u000a      caffeine in pregnancy.[4]\u000d\u000a    Impact on public policy and services\u000d\u000a    In 2008, the team presented their results to COT who, in light of the\u000d\u000a      evidence, decided to review their guidance and publish new recommendations\u000d\u000a      to coincide with the publication of the CARE study.\u000d\u000a    A statement (in 2008) from COT, explicitly referring to the research at\u000d\u000a      Leeds, concluded that while it seems likely that risk of fetal growth\u000d\u000a      restriction is increased in association with caffeine intakes in the order\u000d\u000a      of 200 mg\/day and perhaps even lower, the absolute increase in incidence\u000d\u000a      of fetal growth restriction from intakes less than this is likely to be\u000d\u000a      less than 2% of infants.[C]\u000d\u000a    The FSA issued (in 2008) updated guidelines to women to limit their daily\u000d\u000a      caffeine intake to below 200mg\/day, the equivalent to two mugs of coffee,\u000d\u000a      although caffeine is also present in tea, chocolate, some soft drinks, and\u000d\u000a      certain medicines.[D] The previous advice had set a maximum daily intake\u000d\u000a      of 300mg.\u000d\u000a    This new advice, along with results from the CARE study, was featured in\u000d\u000a      national news reports in both the print and broadcast media, including BBC\u000d\u000a      News Online, The Times, Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph.[E] Professor Cade\u000d\u000a      briefed key stakeholders prior to publication of the study and the FSA\u000d\u000a      guidance.\u000d\u000a    The revised guidelines were taken up by the NHS[F] and included in the\u000d\u000a      Pregnancy Book, which is a highly trusted source of advice handed out to\u000d\u000a      all pregnant women (ca. 700,000 per year) England.[G] The NHS Choices\u000d\u000a      website also contains these recommendations.[H]\u000d\u000a    Through the direct impact of this work &#8212; on the advice given to pregnant\u000d\u000a      women &#8212; all families have the potential to benefit from this research.\u000d\u000a      Moreover, healthcare providers including, GPs, obstetricians and midwives\u000d\u000a      have clearer guidance for delivering appropriate prenatal care. The Royal\u000d\u000a      College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists issued a statement to\u000d\u000a      highlight the updated advice.[I]\u000d\u000a    Data on the potential impact of the advice on caffeine intake in pregnant\u000d\u000a      women for the relevant time period is not yet available. However, it is\u000d\u000a      known that two thirds of infants who die have a low birth weight. Data\u000d\u000a      from the Office for National Statistics show that for 2008-2010 the drop\u000d\u000a      in infant mortality in England and Wales was significantly steeper than\u000d\u000a      for the previous years at 4.5\/1000 live births compared with4.8\/1000 live\u000d\u000a      births in 2006-2008.[J] While this reduction in the infant mortality rate\u000d\u000a      cannot solely be attributed to changing patterns of behaviour during\u000d\u000a      pregnancy in relation to caffeine, we are not aware of other guidance\u000d\u000a      directed at pregnant women during this time, that would have contributed\u000d\u000a      to this steeper rate of decline.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Caffeine is widely consumed in pregnancy as has the potential to harm the\u000d\u000a      developing fetus.

Based on multiple linear\u000a      regressions analysis by crop sector and region, it eliminated distortion\u000a      from inter-annual weather variation to assess underlying growth rates in\u000a      areas irrigated and volumes applied. Alternative future agro-economic,\u000a      policy and technical changes were then modelled, and their influence on\u000a      growth rates estimated. This work underpinned much research on irrigation\u000a      water resources in England and Wales for the next two decades.\u000a    Weatherhead and Knox integrated this research into a (then) novel\u000a      GIS-based methodology, combining abstraction records, government cropping\u000a      censuses, irrigation surveys, spatial soils and agroclimatic data, with a\u000a      crop water-balance model (developed by Hess). This allowed the modelling\u000a      of spatial variations in irrigation water requirements. This was initially\u000a      completed for potatoes [2] and then developed for other nationally\u000a      important irrigated commodity crops.\u000a    By combining historical records with this novel mapping methodology,\u000a      Cranfield researchers identified the underlying spatial trends in areas\u000a      being irrigated, the depths of irrigation water applied and volumetric\u000a      water use, and predicted future changes in irrigation demand under\u000a      contrasting socio-economic scenarios [3]. This research fed directly into\u000a      the Environment Agency's (EA) future water resource planning at catchment,\u000a      regional and national levels.\u000a    By combining these spatial analyses with biophysical and econometric\u000a      models on the effect of water stress on crop yield and price variation\u000a      with crop quality, the researchers identified the financial costs and\u000a      benefits of irrigation, the value of water for agriculture, the spatial\u000a      financial impacts of water shortages and abstraction restrictions on\u000a      irrigated production, and the economic and societal impacts on the wider\u000a      rural economy [4].\u000a    Subsequently, Cranfield researchers incorporated climate change into\u000a      their demand forecasts and quantified the potential impacts on crop\u000a      productivity (yield) [5], water use and the viability of rainfed cropping\u000a      [6]. This allowed them to advise regulators and the agricultural industry\u000a      on the likely impacts and range of adaptation options available in\u000a      high-value commodity agriculture.\u000a    The research also allowed them to identify irrigation water demand\u000a      \"hotspots\" to support the formation of farmer-led water abstractor groups\u000a      and assist the regional development agencies (EEDA, EMDA, SEEDA) in\u000a      adopting a strategic approach for targeting grant aid (RDPE) funding for\u000a      investment in reservoir infrastructure in water-stressed catchments.\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a           Key staff\u000a\u000a           Posts\u000a\u000a           Dates\u000a\u000a           Research\u000a\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Professor K\u000a            Weatherhead\u000a          Lecturer to\u000a            Professor\u000a           1981&#8212;present\u000a          Water engineering, water resources,\u000a            technology, climate change\u000a        \u000a        \u000a           Dr JW Knox\u000a          Research Officer\u000a            to Reader \u000a           1993&#8212;present\u000a          Agricultural systems, water resources, \u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr TM Hess\u000a          Research Officer\u000a            to Reader\u000a           1981&#8212;present\u000a          Modelling; hydrology; ecosystem\u000a            services; sustainability assessment\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6433","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cranfield's research on LCA has been used directly by ministers and in\u000a      public debate, informed public policy, and provided major contributions to\u000a      Foresight and similar planning.\u000a    Ministerial and public debate\u000a    Our research has been used directly by government ministers, such as the\u000a      International Development Secretary when defending international trade\u000a      [1].

In particular, the research contributed methods for\u000a      quantifying uncertainty [6] and improving the approach to quantifying GHGE\u000a      emissions from land use change (LUC). The method for calculating LUC GHGE,\u000a      developed for WWF, also now forms the basis of the method the Dutch\u000a      livestock industry applies for the carbon footprinting of animal feeds\u000a      [7].\u000a    Research on land use per functional unit led to a requirement from Defra\u000a      to study a number of key policy questions, including the best\u000a      configuration of livestock systems, and work for WWF on how to achieve\u000a      very low GHGE from UK food production. The WWF work on dietary change led\u000a      to policy-enabling work for the Committee on Climate Change, contributing\u000a      to the 4th Carbon Budget Report [8].\u000a    The work on livestock systems also contributed to a major Defra workshop\u000a      on animal health, led by the Chief Veterinary Officer in March 2010, and\u000a      to subsequent quantification of the benefits of improving cattle health on\u000a      GHGE for Defra (AC0120).\u000a    Using our systems approach to quantifying the environmental impacts of\u000a      and water use by grazing livestock has also helped levy bodies develop\u000a      roadmaps to reduce the impacts of their industries, and contributed to the\u000a      GHG Action Plan for the English agricultural industry [9].\u000a    Foresight\u000a    The Government Office for Science Foresight Report &#8212; `The Future of Food\u000a      and Farming' [10] cited Cranfield's work on the broad spectrum value of\u000a      systems LCA, based on themed papers on livestock and land use, and\u000a      participation focused on resource use.\u000a    Worldwide\u000a    Our LCA models are accessible to anyone to study and analyse as an Excel\u000a      spreadsheet (https:\/\/webapps2.cranfield.ac.uk\/webforms\/form.jsp?formId=12024).\u000a      Over 800 users globally have downloaded the models.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Cranfield's research on LCA has informed public debate ranging from\u000a      ministerial statements to popular science books, underpinned public policy\u000a      development in the UK and Europe, and provided major contributions to\u000a      Foresight initiatives.

Such systems-based agricultural LCA\u000a      has estimated the environmental performance of production systems and\u000a      supported evaluation of the complex interactions in food systems,\u000a      providing insights into how they can be improved. This research initially\u000a      developed LCAs for ten agricultural commodities [1] (supported by Defra\u000a      project ISO222), immediately prior to and following the research group's\u000a      transfer from BBSRC to Cranfield in 2006. Since 2006, the research has\u000a      expanded rapidly to over 20 projects from Defra, the CCC, industry and\u000a      NGOs.\u000a    The research has integrated LCA models of production systems for milk,\u000a      beef and lamb with models of the interaction between livestock population\u000a      structures and their land and feed requirements. This has enabled advanced\u000a      analysis of options for optimal grassland use in relation to societal\u000a      goals such as the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (GHGE).\u000a    Ground-breaking approaches using integrated systems LCA modelling with\u000a      resource modelling (notably nitrogen), has produced dynamic models [1]\u000a      which are able to calculate yield and protein concentrations (e.g. 13%\u000a      required for bread-making wheat) as a function of available nitrogen\u000a      supply. Such models can identify the nitrogen supply causing GHGE for a\u000a      given land area [2]. Integrating LCA with land use change has enabled the\u000a      modelling of the effect of demand on land use, production and GHGE.\u000a    These approaches provide benefits through the flexibility in the\u000a      questions which can be addressed and rigour in assessing complex systems\u000a      effects. For livestock systems, this means that they are modelled with\u000a      animal production parameters such as fecundity and growth rate, which are\u000a      linked functionally. Thus for example, increasing egg yield demands more\u000a      metabolisable energy, which increases feed inputs, excretion and all\u000a      consequent environmental burdens [3].\u000a    This approach has been extended to the analysis of commodities from the\u000a      UK and abroad [4] and delivering Life Cycle Inventory values where data\u000a      are missing [5], such as in assessing the benefits of improving animal\u000a      genetics independently of management and nutrition. This research has also\u000a      been applied outside of typical questions, such as in providing insights\u000a      into farm energy use from Farm Business Survey data, quantifying energy in\u000a      the agri-food system for Foresight, and in identifying production limits\u000a      set by national emission ceilings as a result of production options and\u000a      technologies. By using national food consumption as a functional unit [6],\u000a      the consequences of changing diets and other behavioural changes on\u000a      food-related GHGE have also been explored. This work included the first\u000a      ever consumption-orientated inventory of GHGE from the entire UK food\u000a      system.\u000a\u0009\u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key staff\u000a          Post\u000a          Dates\u000a          Research\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Eric Audsley\u000a          Principal Research Fellow\u000a          Nov 2005&#8211;present\u000a          Agricultural systems modelling; harmonisation of\u000a            agricultural LCA\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr Adrian Williams\u000a          Senior to Principal Research Fellow\u000a          Dec 2005&#8211;present\u000a          Environmental and agricultural science, LCA\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6434","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Technologies flowing from Cranfield's research on ethylene-supplemented\u000d\u000a      storage of non-climacteric produce (such as onions and potatoes), are\u000d\u000a      already exploited by the Restrain Company. They are being used in the\u000d\u000a      storage facilities of major suppliers, such as Moulton Bulb Company and\u000d\u000a      Stourgarden who service Waitrose and Tesco respectively. The technologies\u000d\u000a      are also having influences beyond the UK, as many of these companies are\u000d\u000a      international businesses. Enhanced storage has prolonged storage lives for\u000d\u000a      onions and potatoes by six weeks, reducing waste and reducing dependence\u000d\u000a      on synthetic chemical sprout suppressants.\u000d\u000a    The annual value of onions going to retail and food manufacturing is\u000d\u000a      estimated at &#163;200 million, of which 54% are produced in the UK (Defra\u000d\u000a      2009). The UK potato industry also delivers sales value of &#163;947 million at\u000d\u000a      the farm gate and &#163;3.8 billion at consumer level (Potato Council\u000d\u000a      Statistics 2013). Ethylene supplementation is having a positive effect on\u000d\u000a      the economics of onion and potato supply by improving the timing of\u000d\u000a      produce release from storage. Prolonging storage is avoiding volatility in\u000d\u000a      supply and contributing to the maintenance of produce prices. Unit waste\u000d\u000a      levels during storage are between 3-10% for onions and potatoes in the UK\u000d\u000a      [1]. A 25% reduction in waste due to enhanced storage is therefore valued\u000d\u000a      at &#163;5 million for onions alone. Such improvements in storage also have a\u000d\u000a      positive impact on the UK's self-sufficiency agenda through greater\u000d\u000a      displacement of imports of onions sourced from overseas.\u000d\u000a    E+&#8482; Ethylene Remover\u000d\u000a    The E+&#8482; Ethylene Remover, based on Cranfield research, was launched\u000d\u000a      commercially in 2009 and is now in use in packaging for most mainstream\u000d\u000a      supermarkets in the UK (Tesco, Waitrose, M&amp;S) and USA, where it has\u000d\u000a      been shown to reduce wastage of a range of fruits and vegetables.

However, Terry's\u000d\u000a      research at Cranfield has shown that many crops currently described as\u000d\u000a      non-climacteric are both sensitive to ethylene and also the ethylene\u000d\u000a      binding inhibitor 1-MCP (1-methylcyclopropene). Importantly, his team has\u000d\u000a      described many of the associated underlying physiological, biochemical and\u000d\u000a      transcriptomic mechanisms, primarily using onion as a model [1,2].\u000d\u000a    Following a Defra HortLINK (HL0164; 2003-2006 [PI = Terry]) on onion\u000d\u000a      quality, and a Horticultural Development Council funded PhD studentship\u000d\u000a      (CP_20; 2003-2006; PI = Terry), further research in collaboration with UK\u000d\u000a      industry was commissioned by Defra (Sustaining UK fresh onion supply by\u000d\u000a      improving consumer acceptability, quality, and availability; HortLINK\u000d\u000a      HL0182; 2007-2010 [PI = Terry]). From this, the first onion\u000d\u000a      oligonucleotide microarray was developed in collaboration with Warwick\u000d\u000a      HRI. This was used to determine differential gene expression in onion\u000d\u000a      during curing and storage, so that transcriptional changes could support\u000d\u000a      targeted metabolomic and physiological analyses. Cranfield's analyses\u000d\u000a      provided novel insights into key regulatory triggers for sprout dormancy\u000d\u000a      release in onion bulbs and the potential for the development of\u000d\u000a      biochemical and transcriptional markers for sprout initiation. The\u000d\u000a      research identified that the ratio of monosaccharides (fructose and\u000d\u000a      glucose) to disaccharide (sucrose) and the concentration of the cytokinin\u000d\u000a      zeatin riboside could be used as pre-symptomatic markers for\u000d\u000a      discriminating between sprouting and pre-sprouting bulbs [1]. Using this\u000d\u000a      novel onion microarray in combination with targeted metabolomic and\u000d\u000a      physiological data, the sprout inhibiting effects of ethylene and 1-MCP\u000d\u000a      proved to be greater when the two treatments were applied in unison [2].\u000d\u000a      This led to the hypothesis that 1-MCP may only bind to certain ethylene\u000d\u000a      receptors and that the combination of both ethylene and 1-MCP may further\u000d\u000a      extend the storage potential of onions and potentially other produce. The\u000d\u000a      practical outcome has been to extend storage life by up to six weeks by\u000d\u000a      supplementing onions with ethylene and related treatments [2,3]. Similar\u000d\u000a      results have been achieved for potatoes and sweetpotato through research\u000d\u000a      directly sponsored by industry (Monsanto and PepsiCo), AHDB and the\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth Commission.\u000d\u000a    In complementary work on the response of fresh produce to ethylene,\u000d\u000a      Cranfield-led research, in conjunction with Johnson Matthey Plc (JM) and\u000d\u000a      It'sFresh!, has led to the development of a new palladium (Pd)-promoted\u000d\u000a      ethylene adsorbing material (E+&#8482; Ethylene Remover) [4, 5]. Uniquely, the\u000d\u000a      material reduces ethylene to sub-physiologically active levels at low\u000d\u000a      temperature and under high relative humidity.

This method, developed further with the\u000a      Macaulay Institute [5], now forms the basis of the current Scottish Soil\u000a      Framework [6].\u000a    National Soil Surveys\u000a    Cranfield has developed and assisted in the implementation of the Irish\u000a      National Soil Survey Scheme. This is based on our soil-landscape modelling\u000a      framework. It has created a new soil map and spatial database of soil\u000a      properties for the whole of the Republic of Ireland. This has benefited\u000a      the Irish Environmental Protection Agency by providing high quality soils\u000a      data for the whole of the Country, saving approximately &#8364;50 million and\u000a      has allowed delivery within five years compared to 25 years by\u000a      conventional methods [7].\u000a    Management of Strategically Important Land Assets\u000a    Cranfield's multi-functional soil landscape modelling has been used by\u000a      the UK Ministry of Defence to predict soil physical conditions, in\u000a      particular soil moisture, on a daily basis. Combining soil landscape\u000a      modelling with real-time soil moisture monitoring has allowed Defence\u000a      Estates to improve the usage of military training grounds covering more\u000a      than 300 km2, whilst ensuring that ecological and soil\u000a      integrity is maintained in these areas.\u000a    The Infrastructure Transactions Research Consortium (ITRC),\u000a      Infrastructure UK (IUK), Defra and Infrastructure Operators in the UK,\u000a      have also used a similar digital soil assessment approach based on\u000a      Cranfield's work to determine the vulnerability of infrastructure to soil\u000a      geohazards (e.g. erosion, subsidence, shrink \/ swell) under current\u000a      conditions and future climate scenarios. In this work a probabilistic soil\u000a      model was superimposed on the critical infrastructure network of the UK at\u000a      25x25 km grid resolution, and in specific case studies at 5x5 km grid\u000a      resolution [8]. In a parallel project a similar probabilistic soil\u000a      landscape model was used by Lincolnshire County Council to determine\u000a      soil-related geohazards to roadways and other linear infrastructure to\u000a      prioritise roads at risk from environmental conditions.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Cranfield's research on improved soil management planning through\u000a      enhanced spatial information has influenced policy development, allowed\u000a      the adoption of new approaches to soil mapping, and enhanced the\u000a      management of strategically important land assets.

This relied on experienced surveyors'\u000a      knowledge of soil-landscape relationships creating paper maps and\u000a      associated monographs. By the mid-1990s, Mayr and others at Cranfield and\u000a      other centres concluded that inference engines, combined with emerging\u000a      geographic information systems (GIS) and increasing access to\u000a      remote-sensed and other environmental data could be used to support\u000a      predictive modelling of soil properties, classes and functions [1].\u000a    The outputs of this research were spatial databases of soil properties\u000a      with quantitative estimates of soil function and, critically, the\u000a      associated uncertainty. The research group at Cranfield, established under\u000a      the leadership of Mayr, with Corstanje, Hannam and others, developed and\u000a      further expanded these insights [2,3].\u000a    A particular research contribution of this group in the late 1990s was\u000a      the insight that high fidelity soil landscape models could only be\u000a      achieved if the form and density of predictions were varied for and\u000a      matched to different landscape categories (strata) [3]. An important\u000a      output from this work has been the development of meaningful strata for\u000a      categorisation of soil-landscapes (`soilscapes').\u000a    Mayr and colleagues implemented this new understanding through the\u000a      application of Bayesian rule-based methods in a sequence of exercises\u000a      starting with small scale trials, moving on to larger prototype exercises\u000a      and, most recently, through the completion of a new digital soil map for a\u000a      complete country. In collaboration with the British Geological Survey,\u000a      Macaulay Land Use Research Institute (now the James Hutton Institute) and\u000a      CEH, these methods have been used to successfully predict soil types for\u000a      50 m2 pixels in two contrasting English landscapes [4]. In\u000a      2006, Cranfield and Teagasc (Ireland) formed a partnership to deliver a\u000a      new soil map and an operational spatial database of soil properties for\u000a      the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Cranfield developed the predictive\u000a      modelling (Mayr, Hannam and Corstanje) with Teagasc conducting field\u000a      surveys and providing data. The approach built strongly on\u000a      previous projects, with rigorous comparison of inference models based on\u000a      field observations. Predictions were made and validated for large areas\u000a      that had not been mapped or had been mapped inconsistently.\u000a    Building on this capability, Cranfield (represented by Mayr), the\u000a      European Commission JRC and Cranfield Visiting Professor Alex McBratney,\u000a      achieved a significant theoretical advancement [5], `digital soil\u000a        assessment', in which the Cranfield contribution is a set of models\u000a      that are used to map soil multi-functionality based on the now exhaustive\u000a      and robust databases of predicted soil information. Mayr then led a\u000a      full-scale prototype exercise with the completion of a soil properties and\u000a      functions database for 10,000 km2 of central England,\u000a      demonstrating the feasibility of generating continuous spatial datasets\u000a      for soil properties in areas with sparse field measurements. This was\u000a      developed further by Mayr, in collaboration with the Macaulay Institute\u000a      and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology to predict soil hydrological and\u000a      other functions, as well as soil properties for two river catchments [6].\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key staff\u000a          Post\u000a          Dates\u000a          Research\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr Thomas Mayr\u000a          Principal Research Fellow, Head of NSRI\u000a          1992&#8211;present\u000a          Digital mapping of soil properties and functions,\u000a            crop modelling, precision farming.\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr Ronald Corstanje\u000a          Senior Lecturer\u000a          2008&#8211;present\u000a          Geostatistics, scaling and scale behaviour, digital mapping of\u000a            soil properties and functions, modelling soil functions and\u000a            ecosystem goods and services.\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr Jacqueline Littler (Hannam)\u000a          Senior Research Fellow\u000a          2004&#8211;present\u000a          Pedology, soil magnetics, digital soil mapping.\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15166","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has attracted repeated investment from pet food\u000a      manufacturers to work with the\u000a      group to improve their diets for cats with CKD, as well as being used by\u000a      veterinary pharmaceutical\u000a      and diagnostics companies to inform product development.

Since 1994\u000a      Professor Jonathan Elliott's group has worked in partnership with the\u000a      animal charity, PDSA, which\u000a      runs primary care practices nationally. (Elliott was appointed Lecturer in\u000a      1990, progressing to\u000a      Professor of Veterinary Clinical Pharmacology in 2003.) Recruitment of\u000a      cats with CKD to\u000a      longitudinal study with disciplined data capture and standardised\u000a      diagnostic and treatment\u000a      protocols has generated cohorts of animals for cross-sectional,\u000a      longitudinal and interventional\u000a      studies. This long term strategy has yielded landmark publications in\u000a      three areas of\u000a      hyperphosphataemia, proteinuria and hypertension, all proven to be\u000a      important factors in\u000a      management of CKD. The group demonstrated that hyperphosphataemia and\u000a      hyperparathyroidism\u000a      could be treated by use of clinical renal diets and effective treatment\u000a      was associated with improved\u000a      survival [1] which complemented experimental data in rats, dogs and cats\u000a      demonstrating the\u000a      damaging effects of phosphate retention in CKD models.\u000a    The recognition by this group that clinical outcome of the CKD patient\u000a      was associated with the\u000a      severity of proteinuria at diagnosis [2] was a seminal observation that\u000a      has changed thinking about\u000a      feline CKD and led to the understanding that monitoring of proteinuria is\u000a      an essential component of\u000a      the management of the feline CKD patient. Furthermore, the association of\u000a      low level proteinuria\u000a      with increased risk of development of azotaemic CKD within 12 months of\u000a      screening has reinforced\u000a      this concept [3]. This research in its preliminary form informed the ACVIM\u000a      Consensus statement on\u000a      proteinuria and feeds in to all current guidelines on the management of\u000a      CKD whereas prior to\u000a      these discoveries proteinuria of this level was largely thought to be\u000a      insignificant in the cat with\u000a      CKD. The group also defined the prevalence of systemic hypertension in CKD\u000a      patients [4]\u000a      identifying that hypokalaemia is a significant risk factor and showed\u000a      hypertension increases the\u000a      severity of proteinuria [2]. They further explored the relationship\u000a      between blood pressure\u000a      management and post-treatment proteinuria, indicating the latter rather\u000a      than post-treatment\u000a      systemic blood pressure was the most important determinant of survival in\u000a      these cats [5].\u000a    Most recently the group have shown that both hyperphosphataemia and\u000a      proteinuria are\u000a      independent risk factors for progressive deterioration in cats with CKD\u000a      [6].\u000a    Other Quality Indicators\u000a      Elliott received the Pfizer Academic Award in 1998, the BSAVA Amoroso\u000a      Award in 2001, the\u000a      Petplan Scientific Award in 2005 and the European Society for Veterinary\u000a      Nephrology and Urology\u000a      Award in 2007 for contributions to companion animal medicine.

In Southeast Asia alone, virus outbreaks have caused the\u000a      destruction of 140 million birds, equating to losses of around $10bn and\u000a      putting low-income families' livelihoods at risk.\u000a    To fill-in data gaps and promote science-based policy implementation, the\u000a      RVC's VEPH team carried out a number of studies as part of a DfID-funded\u000a      programme on Pro-Poor HPAI Risk Reduction Strategies, including risk\u000a      assessments for eight governments in Asia and Africa [a]. The\u000a      studies identified risk factors and geographic hot spots for infection;\u000a      the advantages and disadvantages of vaccination campaigns; and the\u000a      effectiveness of rest days in live bird markets. The risk assessment\u000a      exercises facilitated the formulation of existing scientific evidence into\u000a      risk mitigation strategies. Programme findings were presented at the final\u000a      research meeting in October 2010, held in conjunction with the Animal\u000a      Production and Health Commission for Asia and the Pacific (APHCA) in\u000a      Thailand, attended by senior policy makers from fourteen countries; key\u000a      findings were also reflected in the ten key messages arising out of the\u000a      Programme's Southeast Asia research, and presented to APHCA in November\u000a      2010 [b,c].\u000a    The VEPH team's studies were closely aligned with global disease control\u000a      policy, resulting in the rapid translation of Programme findings into risk\u000a      management strategies. Consequently, governments have been able to tailor\u000a      control measures for high-risk areas, adapt vaccination campaigns to\u000a      minimise the risk of infection and safeguard traders' livelihoods.\u000a      Thailand, Vietnam and Africa have now modified their HPAI control\u000a      strategies, with more focused vaccination and culling campaigns. The UNFAO\u000a      Senior Animal Production and Health Officer for Asia and the Pacific\u000a      commented: \"The RVC's research [...] demonstrated how a number of\u000a        characteristics [...] contribute to disease risk in poultry systems.\u000a        [It] also contributed to the understanding of the social and economic\u000a        context within which poultry producers operate. The RVC's risk\u000a        assessments were therefore critical in informing the Programme's ten key\u000a        messages\" [d]. Recommendations to introduce market rest days as\u000a      opposed to full closure are also likely to have restricted the spread of\u000a      the H5N1 virus. The introduction of rest days has helped secure buy-in\u000a      from local communities for disease control efforts. (Draconian moves to\u000a      force market closures spawn black markets and the creation of favourable\u000a      conditions for the virus.)\u000a    Research activities have been complemented by major capacity building\u000a      work, with veterinary staff from over 70 countries worldwide being trained\u000a      by researchers from the RVC, utilising the underpinning research findings.\u000a      These UNFAO-supported activities were focused on improved surveillance for\u000a      HPAI in endemic and disease-free countries and improved international\u000a      coordination of national surveillance and control efforts [a]. Findings\u000a      were communicated at a UNFAO-backed workshop in Thailand in 2008, attended\u000a      by 80 participants, including government representatives from China,\u000a      Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam [e]. Pfeiffer co- edited\u000a      the book Health and Animal Agriculture in Developing Countries (Natural\u000a      Resource Management and Policy, Vol. 36) (Springer, 2011), which has been\u000a      translated into Chinese and Japanese.\u000a    The VEEPH team's work on risk assessments and surveillance has been\u000a      referenced in various poultry publications and other media\u000a      internationally, including a feature in the British Medical Journal in\u000a      2011, indicating the penetration of the research outcomes encapsulating\u000a      the One Health approach, with broad reach to relevant stakeholders,\u000a      including the human medical profession [f].\u000a    RVC research guided the formulation of guidelines issued in 2011 by\u000a      OFFLU, a network established by the World Organisation for Animal Health\u000a      (OIE) and the UNFAO, on avian influenza surveillance at country level [g].\u000a      The Chairman of OFFLU comments: \"In particular, the RVC's demonstration\u000a        of the demographic, spatial and socio-economic characteristics of\u000a        poultry systems and their associated risks [...] can be evidenced in\u000a        OFFLU's guidance on targeted risk-based sampling for on-farm\u000a        surveillance.\" [h]\u000a    In Europe, Pfeiffer has been a member of the European Food Safety\u000a      Authority's Panel on Animal Health and Welfare. Risk assessments relating\u000a      to HPAI involving the RVC team have shaped guidelines contained in a\u000a      series of Scientific Opinions issued by the EFSA, such as the May 2008\u000a      Statement, in response to a European Commission request, on the animal\u000a      health and welfare aspect of avian influenza and the risk of its\u000a      introduction into the EU poultry holdings. Guidance given in these\u000a      Statements has remained in force throughout the REF impact period [i].\u000a    VEEPH's work was also incorporated into risk management guidelines that\u000a      incorporate value chain analysis, adopted and promoted by the UNFAO, with\u000a      Rushton one of the two main authors. [j].\u000a    In July 2012 the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)\u000a      awarded the RVC the status of FAO Reference Centre in Veterinary\u000a      Epidemiology, a reflection of the global recognition of the RVC as a\u000a      centre of excellence in veterinary epidemiology [k].\u000a    The research findings and RVC's expertise in this field continue to\u000a      impact upon policy discussion in the UK and internationally: Pfeiffer was\u000a      invited to make a presentation on avian flu to the UK Parliamentary Labour\u000a      Party Health Group in January 2013 [l]. He was one of 30 international\u000a      experts invited to an emergency meeting held under the auspices of the\u000a      UNFAO's EMPRES (Emergency Prevention System) Animal Health team in April\u000a      2013 to address epidemiology, surveillance and risk management of H7N9 &#8212;\u000a      the newly emergent strain of avian influenza responsible for the most\u000a      recent outbreaks in China [m], which was recorded, with webcasts available\u000a      from the UNFAO website [n].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Pioneering interdisciplinary research at the Royal Veterinary College\u000a      (RVC) has enabled governments internationally and global health\u000a      authorities to respond swiftly to the outbreak of a disease that causes\u000a      huge economic losses, threatens the livelihoods of vulnerable populations\u000a      in the developing world and endangers human lives.

Since its emergence in 2003, 63 countries have reported outbreaks\u000a      of HPAI subtype H5N1 in domestic and wild birds. The virus constitutes a\u000a      major public health risk; nearly 600 human infections have been reported,\u000a      with a mortality of 60%.\u000a    In 2003, the RVC's Veterinary Epidemiology and Public Health (VEPH) team,\u000a      headed by Dirk Pfeiffer, Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology (since\u000a      1999), embarked on a series of epidemiological field studies, theoretical\u000a      research and data analysis to inform global policy recommendations to\u000a      fight the disease, resulting in more than 30 journal papers in the last\u000a      five years. Since its founding in 1999, the VEPH team (since 2010 VEEPH,\u000a      to additionally include Economics) has expanded to 11 academic staff and\u000a      more than 30 PhD students, research assistants and postdoctoral\u000a      researchers. The team's diverse skill sets, covering economics, risk\u000a      analysis and surveillance, enable their research to be responsive to\u000a      policy needs.\u000a    The VEPH team has undertaken, as lead group and\/or in collaboration with\u000a      colleagues overseas and other UK HEIs, research to determine the\u000a      demographic, spatial and socio-economic characteristics of poultry systems\u000a      and risks associated with H5N1 outbreaks in Asia, Africa and Europe. They\u000a      showed that farming systems in Asia's Mekong delta, involving domestic\u000a      water birds and rice production, represented ideal conditions for the\u000a      spread of infection. Analysis suggested that vaccination campaigns in\u000a      countries such as Vietnam contributed to transmission of infection [1],\u000a      either through ineffective vaccination or via the people administering the\u000a      vaccinations, and that disease incidence peaked before holiday periods.\u000a    Based on the second epidemic wave in Thailand, Pfeiffer was a major\u000a      contributor to a statistical risk model, developed in an international\u000a      collaborative effort led by Universit&#233; Libre de Bruxelles which is\u000a      applicable to countries with similar agro-ecological conditions such as\u000a      Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia [2]. With Javier Guitian, (appointed Lecturer\u000a      in 2002 and progressing to Professor of Veterinary Public Health in 2010),\u000a      as PI, VEPH, in collaboration with Imperial College, demonstrated that\u000a      HPAI H5N1 could be sustained silently within live bird markets, but that\u000a      frequent rest days were an effective means to reduce transmission,\u000a      negating the need to close the market [3]. In Europe, as part of an\u000a      international research team, RVC academics, led by Katharina Staerk,\u000a      (Professor of Veterinary Public Health since 2007), demonstrated the\u000a      effectiveness of ducks as sentinels for avian influenza virus infections\u000a      [4].\u000a    Collaborative work, again with Imperial, in the UK showed that planned\u000a      interventions based on movement restrictions would control the majority of\u000a      outbreaks; neither localized reactive vaccination nor culling were likely\u000a      to have a substantial impact [5]. Globally, the RVC team, including\u000a      Jonathan Rushton, (from 2009, Senior Lecturer and since 2013, Professor of\u000a      Animal Health Economics), demonstrated that confined food animal\u000a      production systems can increase animal and public health risks and\u000a      geographical variations in poultry density and production systems must be\u000a      taken into account to inform preventative measures [6]. In addition, a\u000a      region's socio-economic conditions, including human behaviour, and\u000a      incentives for bioexclusion and biocontainment, give a full understanding\u000a      of the circumstances in which the virus circulates [7,8]\u000a    Other Quality and Relevance Indicators\u000a      Pfeiffer, D.

It is viewed as one of the most costly\u000a      diseases affecting the cattle industry worldwide (losses reported at\u000a      US$10-80 per head). Inefficiencies in livestock management additionally\u000a      impact upon food security and agricultural greenhouse gas production,\u000a      exerting a broader impact on the economy.\u000a    The virus is maintained by a small population of animals that become\u000a      persistently infected (PI) whilst in the uterus during the early stages of\u000a      pregnancy. PI calves, representing 1% of UK cattle, often die prematurely\u000a      with respiratory or enteric disease, or suffer from reproductive disorders\u000a      and stunted growth. The complex pathogenesis of BVD &#8212; elucidated by\u000a      Brownlie's group &#8212; has demonstrated that vaccination is not a simple or\u000a      complete solution.\u000a    The research into persistence of virus, detectable by PCR, after recovery\u000a      of acutely infected animals has guided accreditation of cattle health\u000a      schemes, for effective herd biosecurity, incorporated into the UK Cattle\u000a      Health Certification Standards (CHeCS) [a]. The Executive Director of\u000a      CHeCS confirms: \"The Rules in the Technical Document cover Accredited\u000a        Free; Vaccinated Monitored Free; and Eradication Programmes for BVD.\u000a        They detail blood testing and bulk milk testing methods as well as\u000a        quarantining requirements. RVC's research, particularly its work on\u000a        persistence of virus, detectable by PCR, after recovery of acutely\u000a        infected animals has informed the text that lays out these requirements\u000a        for approved schemes &#8212; such as the Herdsure Accreditation programme,\u000a        offered by the AHVLA.\" [b].The datasheets produced by the Animal\u000a      Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, for interpretation of BVD blood\u000a      and milk tests reflect this [c]. The Veterinary Investigation Officer\u000a      responsible for this at the AHVLA notes: \"The data sheets produced by\u000a        AHVLA Scientific providing the methodology for performance of the BVD\u000a        tests and their interpretation have included additional results from RVC\u000a        Research. [...] RVC Research found that the period for a PCR positive\u000a        result in acute infection could extend for up to 80 days. In any control\u000a        or eradication scheme, persistently infected animals need to be\u000a        identified and removed from the herd whilst animals acutely infected\u000a        seroconvert and recover and can be retained safely. The test data sheets\u000a        provided by AHVLA highlight the possible potentials for confusion and\u000a        emphasise the importance of differentiating between the possible causes\u000a        of a positive result. This is to ensure that infection is managed in the\u000a        herd and comply with the requirements of accredited herd health schemes.\"\u000a      [d].\u000a    RVC's wide-ranging research in this field has informed worldwide\u000a      programmes aimed at eradication. Brownlie's work to identify effective\u000a      control interventions through pilot studies in the UK and drawing on the\u000a      model programme devised in 2006, has positioned him as the `go-to' adviser\u000a      for international governments and organisations committed to BVD\u000a      eradication. After earlier membership of the Scottish Government's\u000a      Strategic Science Advisory Panel, he played a leading role in the launch\u000a      of Scotland's national BVD eradication programme in 2011, running a series\u000a      of master classes, based on his group's findings for hundreds of farmers\u000a      and vets. The President of the National Farmers Union, Scotland, supports\u000a      this: \"The work of Professor Brownlie's research team has created a\u000a        significant part of the veterinary science base on which BVD control\u000a        programmes worldwide have been built... they have been key in driving\u000a        progress at farm level. The development of control networks where\u000a        expertise has been inbedded [sic] into the programme has provided\u000a        real value.\" [e]. Brownlie sat on the Animal Health Ireland Working\u000a      Group to advise on the launch of Ireland's eradication programme in 2009\u000a      [f] and travelled to New Zealand and Bangladesh a year later to advise on\u000a      their programmes, lecturing farmers and vets. Between 2008 and 2012, he\u000a      gave close to 100 lectures to farmers [g], veterinarians, professional\u000a      associations and government organisations worldwide, including in\u000a      Australia and Southern African countries.\u000a    The lectures are part of a proactive strategy, backed by the RVC, to\u000a      disseminate practical findings from research into BVD control globally. In\u000a      2011 Brownlie and Richard Booth (Postdoctoral researcher from 2010 then\u000a      Lecturer in Veterinary Extension Services and Infectious Diseases of\u000a      Cattle from 2012) contributed to educational webinars produced by IDEXX\u000a      Laboratories, the global market leader in diagnostics for animal health,\u000a      which featured three one-hour programmes about the virus. From 260\u000a      registrations, 142 individuals, including veterinarians and students, from\u000a      nine countries participated live, with feedback averaging 8.7\/10. The\u000a      webinars remain available on the IDEXX website [h]. The RVC has developed\u000a      a substantial online BVD resource on its website, including podcasts,\u000a      videos, presentations, papers and press articles [i]. In 2011, the site\u000a      averaged 2,000 hits per month, with downloads up more than 80% on the\u000a      previous year, in 2012 this was up to 2,900 per month, with downloads up a\u000a      further 40%. 40-50% of the visitors originate in the UK and around 15%\u000a      from the US, with over 20 countries making up the remainder [j].\u000a    The Swiss mitigation programme is scheduled to run from 2008 to 2017,\u000a      with break-even estimated in 2012. Scotland and Ireland are pressing ahead\u000a      with national control programmes, guided by the work to which RVC has\u000a      contributed.\u000a    Brownlie has campaigned for the introduction of a national BVD\u000a      eradication programme for England and Wales, drawing on field research in\u000a      East Anglia and the West Country. Prior to the REF impact period, he\u000a      advised BIS on its Foresight Programme on `Detection and Identification of\u000a      Infectious Diseases' and, having secured the support of the UK's Chief\u000a      Veterinary Officer, he established the National BVD Control Group in order\u000a      to lay the foundations for a future national programme. The UK CVO\u000a      confirms the contribution from RVC research: \"The research findings and\u000a        Professor Brownlie's direct advocacy, informed by this work, have\u000a        contributed substantially to the management of this disease, which is a\u000a        major global issue for the cattle industry. Professor Brownlie has been\u000a        an indefatigable proponent of the application of BVC control measures in\u000a        the field.\" [k] In 2008 Brownlie brought the Group under the English\u000a      Cattle Health and Welfare Group (ECHWG, now CHAWG) [l], set up to ensure\u000a      the delivery of DEFRA's Animal Health and Welfare Strategy to the cattle\u000a      sector in England. The ECHWG immediately made BVD control one of its six\u000a      priorities, and this remains an important component of its activities [m].\u000a    As part of the UK pilot programmes, Brownlie has sought exposure in\u000a      specialist media to raise awareness of BVD among vets and farmers,\u000a      together with political and industrial support for the national programme\u000a      in England and Wales, through several articles from 2008 to 2012,\u000a      including pieces in Farmers Weekly and the Veterinary Times. This coverage\u000a      has contributed to Brownlie receiving an average of two professional\u000a      enquiries a week for BVD-related advice [n].\u000a    Eradication programmes - as modelled by the Swiss scheme take around 10\u000a      years to reach final phases, so full impact is protracted. However, RVC's\u000a      economic analysis of the Swiss programme has shown a substantial margin\u000a      over eradication cost is achievable. Although a UK-wide programme has yet\u000a      to be implemented, at both at individual farm and national level (abroad),\u000a      uptake of livestock management and disease control measures for BVD,\u000a      informed by the RVC's work and active role in dissemination, has already\u000a      delivered financial, health and welfare benefits.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Interdisciplinary research at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) has\u000a      provided core evidence on which global efforts are based in order to\u000a      eradicate one of the most economically damaging diseases of the cattle\u000a      industry. The research findings have helped steer national programmes to\u000a      eradicate Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) across Europe, South Asia and\u000a      Australasia, reducing economic losses. Professor Joe Brownlie has\u000a      additionally led pilot programmes in the UK, providing data for a national\u000a      scheme, campaigned widely to highlight the issue and secured farming\u000a      industry awareness and support through media exposure.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    Royal Veterinary College\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Royal Veterinary College","InstitutionName":"Royal Veterinary College","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007779}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Brownlie moved to the RVC from the Institute for\u000a      Animal Health in 1996, (where he had discovered the complex viral\u000a      pathogenesis causing mucosal disease and developed the first vaccine to\u000a      offer foetal protection.)\u000a    In 2002, RVC became a member of a new European Union Thematic Network for\u000a      the control of BVD. The group examined systematic approaches to control,\u000a      emphasising that vaccination did not provide a complete solution.\u000a    In 2004, Brownlie and his team embarked on a five-year, &#163;1.4m\u000a      DEFRA-funded programme of BVD research. The group showed the exquisite\u000a      molecular variation existing between isolates on farms, which has, for the\u000a      first time, permitted detailed molecular epidemiology [1] and, as a\u000a      result, contributed to a fuller understanding of disease transmission and\u000a      biosecurity risks. This work further demonstrated that the available\u000a      vaccines were still appropriate for use in the UK.\u000a    Building on earlier research into strategic measures for BVD control,\u000a      Brownlie co-authored a 2006 review [2] that presented a viable, systematic\u000a      model for BVD control across Europe that (regardless of vaccination use)\u000a      necessitated effective biosecurity, elimination of Persistently Infected\u000a      (PI) animals and surveillance, and the need for cooperation from farmers'\u000a      organisations.\u000a    In 2008, the RVC group demonstrated that infected, recovered and immune\u000a      animals have the potential to cause infection in BVD Virus-na&#239;ve cohorts\u000a      for far longer than previously demonstrated or anticipated. This knowledge\u000a      has informed the biosecurity requirements of the Cattle Health\u000a      Certification Standards (CHeCS) [3].\u000a    The outputs of the Thematic Network [4] were used in planning and\u000a      implementing the Swiss national mitigation programme for BVD in 2008, and\u000a      in 2012, researchers led by Katharina St&#228;rk, Professor of Veterinary\u000a      Public Health Policy (from 2007), from RVC's Veterinary and Epidemiology\u000a      Public Health group, undertook an economic analysis of the programme to\u000a      identify positive net economic benefit [5].\u000a    In collaboration with veterinarians and farmers, Brownlie devised\u000a      longitudinal on-farm studies in Scotland, East Anglia and Somerset to\u000a      define production losses and the cost-benefit of eradicating BVD on UK\u000a      farms in order to provide real data to support a national programme of\u000a      disease control. In 2012 Brownlie published results from the Somerset\u000a      study that showed an increase from 41% to 71% BVDV-free farms after the\u000a      three years of management [6], with 10\/20 of the initially infected farms\u000a      being cleared of the disease and the others set to follow.\u000a    Other quality and Relevance Indicators\u000a    Brownlie.

The\u000d\u000a      overall value in agriculture is to improve animal productivity and\u000d\u000a      increase the food supply. Up to 85% of swine are now bred using AI.\u000d\u000a      Improvements in efficiency, to which the RVC has contributed [a], have\u000d\u000a      resulted in lowering AI costs and expansion in its use.\u000d\u000a    Although bull sperm are readily recovered viably after freezing, and are\u000d\u000a      produced in quantity, boar sperm has not been as amenable for use in\u000d\u000a      commercial AI. Sperm quantity per inseminate must be sufficient to ensure\u000d\u000a      maximum fecundity, (which has restricted usable `doses' per ejaculate), as\u000d\u000a      economic value is driven by number of piglets per litter contributing to\u000d\u000a      total lean tonnage. Use of frozen\/thawed sperm remains a small fraction of\u000d\u000a      the total, commercially valuable for accessing high genetic value boars\u000d\u000a      which deliver higher lean content in offspring. The novel formulation of\u000d\u000a      cryopreservation biological media that Watson's team developed, informed\u000d\u000a      by their research into factors affecting fresh and frozen\/thawed sperm\u000d\u000a      competence, have become standard in pig production using frozen\/thawed\u000d\u000a      sperm. The Knowledge Transfer Manager at the British Pig Executive (BPEX)\u000d\u000a      confirms: \"The RVC's research has contributed to its [AI] expansion\u000d\u000a        within the sector, and the accompanying economic and commercial\u000d\u000a        benefits. Watson and Behan's work on improving the sperm competency of\u000d\u000a        frozen\/ thawed boar semen, through new, and now standard, biological\u000d\u000a        media formulations, has brought a number of benefits.\" [b]. This,\u000d\u000a      together with the team's identification of genetic markers which indicate\u000d\u000a      the viability of boar sperm for cryopreservation and likely fresh\u000d\u000a      longevity, has addressed sub-optimal performance of frozen\/thawed boar\u000d\u000a      semen, as well as helping to overcome the short period of usability for\u000d\u000a      fresh ejaculates, which formerly restricted access to the highest genetic\u000d\u000a      stock, by reasons of distance and transport logistics.\u000d\u000a    RVC's research also demonstrated that a significantly smaller sperm\u000d\u000a      sample may be used for post cervical AI - leveraging gain from high\u000d\u000a      genetic value boars - with appropriate biological media, without loss of\u000d\u000a      reproductive success [b]. The expertise of the RVC team was sought by\u000d\u000a      world leading agricultural breeding business IMV Technologies, leading to\u000d\u000a      a collaboration including field trials in pigs, using 50% of the\u000d\u000a      previously accepted industry standard of sperm numbers per insemination,\u000d\u000a      enabling twice as many inseminations per boar [5].\u000d\u000a    The new Deepgoldenpig catheter, originally developed in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with IMV Technologies for use with fresh semen, additionally facilitated\u000d\u000a      use of reduced sperm concentration to enable a wider application of\u000d\u000a      cryopreserved semen from superior boars. Field trials for a second new\u000d\u000a      catheter, Goldengilt, demonstrated that intracervical AI of gilts as well\u000d\u000a      as sows, with small sperm doses, could be undertaken safely and simply by\u000d\u000a      stockmen with appropriate training. IMV states that more than 30% of all\u000d\u000a      pig breeders worldwide now use the company's `gold standard' insemination\u000d\u000a      solutions [c]. The efficacy of these new catheters, as demonstrated by the\u000d\u000a      RVC's field trials research, has led to their being supplied through or\u000d\u000a      copied by many other AI technology companies internationally, including\u000d\u000a      e.g. Schippers and Innovis [d,e].\u000d\u000a    Evidence that managing contact between boars and sows prior to breeding\u000d\u000a      can maximise breeding performance, has established SSM, in a refined form,\u000d\u000a      as standard practice internationally in commercial pig breeding operations\u000d\u000a      using AI [f]. This is also confirmed by BPEX: \"... [RVC] work played a\u000d\u000a        key role in understanding the importance of the management of contact\u000d\u000a        time in providing optimal conditions for insemination ... developing\u000d\u000a        practices which have now become standard in many commercial breeding\u000d\u000a        operations.\" [b].\u000d\u000a    As pig breeding has become professionalised in recent years, the value of\u000d\u000a      these developments has contributed to the expansion and economic value of\u000d\u000a      AI in commercial pig breeding. (Around 20-30% of total global production\u000d\u000a      before the REF period, to 60-80%+ in 2013).\u000d\u000a    Human assisted reproduction\u000d\u000a    In seeking to further minimise the spread of infection, Watson's research\u000d\u000a      into the transmission of infectious agents by semen during storage in\u000d\u000a      liquid nitrogen has led to good practice guidelines for aseptic\u000d\u000a      preparation and well-sealed packaging. The findings have been taken up in\u000d\u000a      human medical AI to minimise risk of HIV or other viruses contaminating\u000d\u000a      shared storage of semen samples [g]. The Scientific Director of the Centre\u000d\u000a      for Reproductive Medicine, University Hospital Coventry, comments: \"In\u000d\u000a        our clinical protocol, we use a purpose designed commercial kit that\u000d\u000a        includes a disposable spacer device that avoids the tip of the straw\u000d\u000a        coming into contact with the semen. This spacer is discarded once the\u000d\u000a        straw is filled. [...] The concept of keeping the semen out of contact\u000d\u000a        with the tip of the straw for hygiene purposes, as recommended in the\u000d\u000a        paper [research reference 8], [...] has been adopted into routine\u000d\u000a        clinical practice.\" [h]\u000d\u000a    Conservation\u000d\u000a    The extensive studies at RVC on sperm cryopreservation have played a\u000d\u000a      central role in the global development of Genetic Resource Banks (GRBs),\u000d\u000a      now recognised as one of the most effective means by which threatened\u000d\u000a      species can be preserved and managed [i]. As the Head of the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Species Survival at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has\u000d\u000a      commented: \"...the concepts developed and the research conducted at\u000d\u000a        the RVC are contributing to the acceptance and advancement of GRBs and\u000d\u000a        cryobiology to benefit managing and conserving endangered species ...\u000d\u000a        [these tools] are rapidly becoming common to zoo breeding programs\u000d\u000a        throughout North America and Europe\". The RVC's research has\u000d\u000a      therefore enhanced the success of efforts to maintain and increase\u000d\u000a      biodiversity of small breeding populations without the costs, risks and\u000d\u000a      impracticality of live animal transportation. Successful examples recorded\u000d\u000a      by the Smithsonian include development of protocols to produce offspring\u000d\u000a      from the AI of frozen sperm from the scimitar-horned oryx and cheetah, and\u000d\u000a      the preservation of sperm of the black-footed ferret, one of the rarest\u000d\u000a      mammals in all of North America. The species was thought extinct before\u000d\u000a      1979, but its rediscovery and an ongoing major captive breeding programme\u000d\u000a      from 18 animals has enabled re-introduction at 19 sites in the USA, Canada\u000d\u000a      and Mexico. Ferret offspring have been produced from sperm cryopreserved\u000d\u000a      for more than two decades [j].The wild population is still endangered, but\u000d\u000a      is estimated to have expanded since 2008 from 700 to 1,000 [k].\u000d\u000a    In conclusion, the RVC's research has helped to increase the productivity\u000d\u000a      of domestic livestock in all developed farming territories, providing real\u000d\u000a      economic value. This programme of work has additionally contributed to\u000d\u000a      safeguarding of human health in assisted reproduction and made a critical\u000d\u000a      contribution to successful captive breeding and maintenance of genetic\u000d\u000a      biodiversity for wildlife conservation and species survival.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Different aspects of Professor Paul Watson's research on artificial\u000d\u000a      insemination and semen preservation techniques, have delivered impact in\u000d\u000a      agricultural, human healthcare and ecological spheres.

Their work has demonstrated capacitation changes resulting\u000d\u000a      from freezing damage, resulting in lowered fertility in use of\u000d\u000a      cryopreserved semen. Through research into cell damage and its prevention,\u000d\u000a      including the use of oviductal proteins, seminal plasma, antifreeze\u000d\u000a      proteins and glycoproteins to enhance sperm survival and fertility, the\u000d\u000a      RVC's research has contributed to new biological media formulations\u000d\u000a      relating to protection against cooling damage, dilution, premature\u000d\u000a      capacitation and ice crystal formation [1,2].\u000d\u000a    The cryopreservation research led to a programme supported by BBSRC and\u000d\u000a      the commercial PIC International Group, which identified genetic\u000d\u000a      variability in cryopreserved sperm viability in boars [3]. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      the research, in collaboration with Dr William Holt at the Institute of\u000d\u000a      Zoology, led to their establishment of improved cryopreservation\u000d\u000a      techniques applicable to different mammalian species. Holt, supported by\u000d\u000a      Watson, led a European Framework III Concerted Action project in 1994, to\u000d\u000a      develop formal systems and guidelines for establishing Genetic Resource\u000d\u000a      Banks (GRBs) [4].\u000d\u000a    In 2002, RVC published the results of a substantial field trial,\u000d\u000a      supported by a large pig farm and commercial suppliers of semen for AI and\u000d\u000a      sows [5]. This demonstrated both that simple, safe and effective\u000d\u000a      transcervical insemination of sows, rather than the conventional\u000d\u000a      insemination into the posterior region of the cervix, could be undertaken\u000d\u000a      by stockmen in a commercial setting, by use of the novel catheter design\u000d\u000a      (the Deepgoldenpig) developed by IMV Technologies in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      the RVC researchers, and that fertility was unaffected by a much reduced\u000d\u000a      sperm dose, if delivered directly to the uterus.\u000d\u000a    The close involvement of industry partners from different parts of the\u000d\u000a      production chain (pig farms, boar stud, and reproductive technologies\u000d\u000a      company) enabled continued research into optimising fertility and\u000d\u000a      fecundity through management of boar contact [6]. The team showed\u000d\u000a      `Segregated Service Management' (SSM) - isolating weaned sows from boar\u000d\u000a      stimulation until day 4 post-weaning, followed by full boar contact to\u000d\u000a      elicit oestrus before AI, resulted in significantly improved farrowing\u000d\u000a      rate and litter size, in comparison with conventional continuous contact.\u000d\u000a    This was followed by research into AI of gilts, which was not as commonly\u000d\u000a      practised, due to the smaller dimension of the cervix representing a\u000d\u000a      barrier, and susceptibility to mucosal damage. The research team\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the practical application, with minimal training, of a novel\u000d\u000a      modified catheter with a narrow extension (the Goldengilt, now produced by\u000d\u000a      IMV Technologies). This was used with reduced semen concentration and\u000d\u000a      still resulted in farrowing and litter sizes comparable to or better than\u000d\u000a      usually observed commercially by natural service [7].\u000d\u000a    In 1997, the group identified the potential for transmission of\u000d\u000a      infectious agents through leakage and contamination of semen stored in\u000d\u000a      liquid nitrogen [8].

It has been estimated that up to 15% of dogs presented to a\u000d\u000a      practice may show some signs of cardiac disease and this increases to over\u000d\u000a      40% in dogs older than 7 years of age. DMVD, which is progressive and\u000d\u000a      incurable, accounts for around 75% of all cases of canine congestive heart\u000d\u000a      failure. A number of breeds show a predisposition &#8212; such as Cavalier King\u000d\u000a      Charles Spaniels (most animals eventually affected and high proportion at\u000d\u000a      younger age), Chihuahuas, fox terriers, Boston terriers and miniature\u000d\u000a      poodles, pinschers and schnauzers. Dobermans and a number of other large\u000d\u000a      breeds have disproportionately high rates of dilated cardiomyopathy.\u000d\u000a    Diagnosis can be challenging: Clinical signs of cardiac disease may be\u000d\u000a      absent or indistinguishable from those of other conditions, particularly\u000d\u000a      respiratory disease. Indications from physical examination may be\u000d\u000a      inconclusive, especially in a distressed, anxious or uncooperative patient\u000d\u000a      and thoracic radiographs difficult to interpret. Detection of a heart\u000d\u000a      murmur is not conclusive. Cardiac ultrasound, which usually requires\u000d\u000a      referral to a specialist, is often necessary to fully characterise the\u000d\u000a      disease. However, a cardiac biomarker can be used in first opinion\u000d\u000a      practice as part of the diagnostic workup and guide decisions about\u000d\u000a      additional testing, the need for referral and treatment.\u000d\u000a    [text removed for publication]. The RVC team has continued to work in\u000d\u000a      partnership with Idexx to provide evidence for the clinical value of this\u000d\u000a      test and to identify ways of enhancing this.\u000d\u000a    Prior to 2008, ACE inhibitors were the primary drug class used in\u000d\u000a      treatment for canine DMVD. The QUEST trial demonstrated compelling\u000d\u000a      evidence (91% improvement) that pimobendan in conjunction with\u000d\u000a      conventional therapy could prolong life. Accompanying the publication of\u000d\u000a      the trial results, an editorial, by Mark Oyama of University of\u000d\u000a      Pennsylvania, commented: \"I ... currently consider pimobendan the single\u000d\u000a      most important addition to the medical therapy of dogs with symptomatic\u000d\u000a      DMVD and dilated cardiomyopathy since becoming a veterinary cardiologist\u000d\u000a      more than a decade ago. ... the study by Haggstrom et al is to be\u000d\u000a      commended not only for its ambition and meticulous reporting but also for\u000d\u000a      its ultimately successful multicentered design\"[d].\u000d\u000a    An American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Consensus Statement,\u000d\u000a      which disseminates good practice via cardiology specialists in the USA and\u000d\u000a      Europe, to which RVC contributed, was rapidly issued reflecting these\u000d\u000a      findings [e].\u000d\u000a    The trial results have transformed sales of the drug (as Vetmedin) during\u000d\u000a      the REF impact period.

Boswood has published work which clearly defined\u000d\u000a      risk factors for progression [1] in a heterogeneous population of dogs\u000d\u000a      presenting to primary care practices in the UK.\u000d\u000a    His research has focused particularly on the potential of natriuretic\u000d\u000a      peptides as biomarkers and their combination with other parameters, to\u000d\u000a      refine prognosis and management. Although increased concentration of\u000d\u000a      atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was known to be associated with heart\u000d\u000a      failure, its short plasma half-life and instability after collection made\u000d\u000a      it impractical to use as a biomarker, and Boswood proposed that a proANP\u000d\u000a      assay could have practical value. The RVC research team, collaborated with\u000d\u000a      the biotechnology business, Guildhay Ltd, demonstrating that an ELISA for\u000d\u000a      a proANP fragment could distinguish normal dogs from those with heart\u000d\u000a      failure [2]. After further discussion between Boswood and Guildhay it was\u000d\u000a      suggested that an assay for NTproBNP would be superior to a proANP assay.\u000d\u000a      Such an assay was developed and shown to discriminate between respiratory\u000d\u000a      and cardiac disease in dogs presenting with difficulty breathing [3], thus\u000d\u000a      offering a valuable diagnostic for first opinion practice. The Guildhay\u000d\u000a      assay acted as the prototype for the Idexx assay that is now marketed and\u000d\u000a      used internationally.\u000d\u000a    Prospective studies of dogs in primary care practice determined the\u000d\u000a      prognostic value &#8212; in predicting mortality &#8212; of measuring NT-proBNP in\u000d\u000a      dogs presenting with a heart murmur, indicative of degenerative mitral\u000d\u000a      valve disease (DMVD), in partnership with Idexx Laboratories and CEVA\u000d\u000a      Animal Health [4]. This work has been extended to show enhanced prognostic\u000d\u000a      value of combining NT-proBNP with high sensitivity cardiac troponin I in\u000d\u000a      serial blood samples to identify dogs progressing to cardiac death [1].\u000d\u000a    Boswood's recognition as a key opinion leader in cardiology clinical\u000d\u000a      trial design and analysis has positioned him to contribute in a major way\u000d\u000a      to international multicentre trials. The outcome of the QUEST trial [5] is\u000d\u000a      recognised as one of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the, then\u000d\u000a      unexpected (based on mode of action), beneficial effects of the calcium\u000d\u000a      sensitiser, pimobendan, on survival of dogs with DMVD when evaluated\u000d\u000a      relative to treatment which was considered at that time to be the gold\u000d\u000a      standard; benazepril. In 2002 Boswood was one of four members of the\u000d\u000a      clinical trial committee and one of two academics who led the design of\u000d\u000a      the study protocol. His input (with that of lead author Professor Jens\u000d\u000a      Haagstrom, of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences) meant this\u000d\u000a      study overcame shortcomings of previous trials addressing survival as an\u000d\u000a      end-point and produced compelling evidence for the benefit of pimobendan.\u000d\u000a      In particular, it had the highest event rate of any of the published\u000d\u000a      studies due to the care taken in defining three related endpoints a\u000d\u000a      priori; was appropriately powered to address the relative benefits\u000d\u000a      of the two drugs; and offered the most comprehensive consideration of\u000d\u000a      co-variates of any studies involving DMVD in the dog. As such it is\u000d\u000a      considered to provide the best current evidence for benefit of treatment\u000d\u000a      in slowing disease progression.\u000d\u000a    Boehringer Ingelheim invited Boswood to be involved in the subsequent\u000d\u000a      `PROTECT' trial: to contribute to study design, screen cases for\u000d\u000a      inclusion, undertake an interim analysis, advise on the continuation and\u000d\u000a      conclusion of the study, and participate in the publication committee, as\u000d\u000a      supervisor for the statistical analysis and corresponding author. PROTECT\u000d\u000a      examined the effect of pimobendan administration in the preclinical phase\u000d\u000a      of dilated cardiomyopathy in Doberman Pinschers. At its inception, the\u000d\u000a      value of inotropic drugs in asymptomatic dogs was considered highly\u000d\u000a      controversial. The study demonstrated a significant prolongation to the\u000d\u000a      time to onset of congestive heart failure or sudden death in the dogs\u000d\u000a      receiving pimobendan: the first cardiology study to demonstrate clear\u000d\u000a      benefit of therapy in a pre-clinical period [6]. It was also the first to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate a survival benefit in dogs identified through screening of an\u000d\u000a      apparently normal population.\u000d\u000a    Other quality indicators\u000d\u000a      Boswood, A.

Its introduction into some countries has resulted in the loss of\u000a      between 30 and 50% of the pig population. There is no vaccine and no\u000a      treatment available. It has become endemic in many infected territories\u000a      and (outside Africa) its principal impact has been economic, through loss\u000a      of status for international trade and costly control strategies to\u000a      eliminate the disease. In Spain, this has been estimated as US$92 million\u000a      over 5 years. The net benefit of preventing ASF introduction in the USA is\u000a      accounted to be almost US$4,500 million &#8212; nearly 5% of the value of total\u000a      pork product sales. Defra cites the scale of concern in Europe by\u000a      comparison with classical swine fever (CSF) outbreaks: in East Anglia in\u000a      2000\/2001 control costs were &#163;4.4 million and the total cost of a large\u000a      outbreak of CSF in the Netherlands in 1997 was estimated at $2.3 billion.\u000a    For these reasons, it is considered crucial to avoid ASF progressing into\u000a      and across European Union territories (infection within the EU is\u000a      currently limited to Sardinia). The presence of ASF in relatively\u000a      near-border Russian Federation territories has caused grave concern to the\u000a      European Union.\u000a    The ASFRISK consortium project has enabled RVC, as leaders of work\u000a      package 3, to contribute to the first risk assessment for ASF virus\u000a      introduction via live pig importation for the EU [a]. The identification\u000a      of geographical areas and time periods of highest risk has helped improve\u000a      the effectiveness of surveillance programmes, as well as improved\u000a      biosecurity policies.\u000a    RVC contributed to the EFSA's ASF working group, and led the development\u000a      of a generic qualitative model underpinning this risk assessment. This was\u000a      applied to assess risks of different routes of transmission of ASF from\u000a      the Trans Caucasus countries and Russian Federation into the EU. The model\u000a      considered ASF remaining endemic in domestic pigs and\/or in wild boars in\u000a      these territories and spreading; and the risk of it becoming endemic in EU\u000a      domestic pigs and or wild boars if introduced. The conclusions informed\u000a      EFSA's Scientific Opinion on ASF requested by the European Commission [b\u000a      c].\u000a    The transparency of the model enabled decision-makers at the European\u000a      Commission to recognise the critical points and also the uncertainties\u000a      affecting the risk estimates, allowing improvement in mitigation measures.\u000a      The Chief of the Animal Health Service, Animal Production and Health\u000a      Division of the FAO notes: \"The group contributes both through written\u000a        reports and direct contact with decision makers, including participation\u000a        in advisory committees [...] in developing a generic qualitative model\u000a        for risk assessment, they created a tool that [...] has the additional\u000a        and broader value that it can be adapted to assessment of risk of other\u000a        diseases, spread through pig, and potentially other, livestock trade.\"[d]\u000a    Following the guidance from the risk assessment, in February 2011, the\u000a      Official Journal of the European Union published a Commission Decision,\u000a      `in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food\u000a      Chain and Animal Health' relating specifically to addressing risk of ASF\u000a      transmission from Russia [e]. The issue remains under regular\u000a      consideration by the Committee, on behalf of the Commission [f].\u000a    The Commission has publicly reported its use of the ASFRISK outputs, in\u000a      control strategies for ASF, and in promoting its willingness to provide\u000a      training and help neighbouring countries to manage the problem, to the FAO\u000a      and Russia [g,h].

His experience as a veterinary epidemiologist\u000a      working in animal and public health led to his appointment as Chair of the\u000a      AHVLA's independent Surveillance Advisory Group tasked to develop\u000a      recommendations for a new more effective and affordable approach to\u000a      veterinary surveillance in UK. As Chair, Pfeiffer used his research\u000a      findings to inform the overall structure and priorities of the group. The\u000a      group's recommendations have been accepted by Defra, and are now in the\u000a      process of being implemented under the Surveillance 2014 project, for\u000a      which Pfeiffer has been appointed to the Project Board [i]. In addition,\u000a      Pfeiffer was asked to join the Exotic Disease Subgroup of Defra's Science\u000a      Advisory Council, which acts as a policy advisory body to the Chief\u000a      Scientific Advisor and Chief Veterinary Officer regarding Defra's\u000a      preparedness to manage outbreaks of exotic diseases such as ASF.\u000a      Furthermore, the RVC is a member of the Global African Swine Fever\u000a      Alliance which promotes international knowledge exchange to fight this\u000a      disease [j].\u000a    In July 2012 the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)\u000a      awarded the RVC the status of FAO Reference Centre in Veterinary\u000a      Epidemiology, a reflection of the global recognition of the RVC as a\u000a      centre of excellence in veterinary epidemiology [k].

Shortly after joining the\u000a      RVC, Pfeiffer published a paper with colleagues from Massey University\u000a      applying spatial analysis techniques to data from the UK BSE epidemic\u000a      demonstrating the power of this technique in disease surveillance and the\u000a      recommendation of control measures [2].\u000a    This led to work on ASF commencing in 2005, supported by a Wellcome Trust\u000a      programme grant in collaboration with the Pirbright Institute and various\u000a      European partners. In 2009, the VEEPH team, with Pirbright and\u000a      international collaborators, reviewed the risk of global spread of ASF,\u000a      and highlighted loss associated with outbreaks as well as the immense cost\u000a      of eradication methods [3, 4].\u000a    The role in the Wellcome Trust project identified RVC as a key partner\u000a      for contributing the risk assessment component of the EU 7th\u000a      Framework Programme (FP7) project `Evaluating and controlling the risk of\u000a      African Swine Fever in the EU' (ASFRISK): leading Work Package 3 &#8212; `Risk\u000a      Assessment of the introduction of ASFV into the EU'. RVC, together with\u000a      University of Belfast (working on diagnostics), were the only UK members\u000a      of the 17 party international consortium.\u000a    In 2011, Barbara Wieland (originally a post-doc on the Wellcome Trust\u000a      programme promoted to lecturer in Epidemiology 2007 - 2012) led the risk\u000a      assessment aspect of the working group of the European Food Safety\u000a      Authority (EFSA) on ASF resulting in the development of a qualitative\u000a      model to assess the impact of control measures on the spread of ASF. The\u000a      hierarchical model has a limited number of key steps, but with very\u000a      detailed sub-steps, allowing disassociation of steps in risk pathways and\u000a      avoidance of pre-conceived notions of final risk estimates. Overall risk\u000a      estimates for pathways can be derived by using systematic combination\u000a      matrices. The model has particular value in data-scarce environments. [5].\u000a      In addition, in 2011, research undertaken by Wieland and Pfeiffer informed\u000a      the first quantitative risk assessment for ASF virus entering the EU via\u000a      legal import of live pigs [6, 7], identifying geographical areas and time\u000a      periods of increased risk, thus informing development of targeted\u000a      risk-based surveillance and control strategies. The model produced a\u000a      flexible and easily updated risk-based tool for use by policy makers.\u000a      Complementing the disease-specific assessments, in 2011, Pfeiffer\u000a      published an evaluation of spatial modelling approaches to highlight\u000a      advantages and limitations of different methods [8]. This noted that\u000a      decision makers generally require a binary map requiring selection of a\u000a      threshold value to convert probabilistic outputs generated by modelling,\u000a      and also that the most extensively used spatial modelling method &#8212; the\u000a      generic algorithm for rule set production &#8212; has been shown to be one of\u000a      the worst performing methods in comparison with others. Two methods with\u000a      highest performance, boosted regression trees and maximum entropy, have\u000a      been infrequently used to date in modelling disease distribution.\u000a    The particular expertise of the group and outputs from the ASFRISK\u000a      project helped secure funding for the EU FP7 ASFORCE project, in which RVC\u000a      has played a key role &#8212; in leading the modelling and economic analysis &#8212;\u000a      in an international consortium of 17, focussed particularly on the threat\u000a      of ASF from Eastern Europe.\u000a    Other Quality Indicators\u000a    D Pfeiffer.

RVC\u000a      granted an exclusive\u000a      licence to VetCell to the patented technology identifying Professors Roger\u000a      Smith and Allen\u000a      Goodship (with others) as inventors [a]. The company was purchased in 2010\u000a      by Quy Biosciences\u000a      Ltd, and in 2013 became a subsidiary of Westhouse Medical Ltd, [text\u000a      removed for publication] [b].\u000a      The patent is now granted or pending in UK, USA, Canada, Europe, (Austria,\u000a      Belgium,\u000a      Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and\u000a      Sweden), Australia and New\u000a      Zealand. Professor Smith has been a director (1\/08 - 1\/11) and advisor\u000a      (1\/11 - 12\/12) to the\u000a      company though much of the impact assessment period.\u000a    VetCell works with a large number of independent veterinary surgeons\u000a      (including those of RVC)\u000a      who provide the clinical components of the therapy (collection of stem\u000a      cells and injection to the\u000a      injured tendon of the expanded culture). The company, authorised by the\u000a      Veterinary Medicines\u000a      Directorate, undertakes expansion of the cells using a commercial contract\u000a      laboratory. Substantial\u000a      international expansion of the business during 2008 was enabled through\u000a      the UK Trade and\u000a      Investment Passport to Export programme (initiated in 2007), which\u000a      recognised VetCell for\u000a      Outstanding Achievement through the Programme and in its Special Award for\u000a      BioEntrepreneurial\u000a      Company of the Year 2007 [c]. VetCell's services are now offered in the\u000a      UK, USA, Canada,\u000a      Germany, France, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Norway,\u000a      with 1,235 horses\u000a      treated between 2008 and 2012.\u000a    Tendon injuries are a particular problem in performance horses,\u000a      especially National Hunt\u000a      racehorses, with approximately 25% incurring some tendon damage during\u000a      training. In 2012, there\u000a      were nearly 5,000 horses in training for National Hunt racing in Great\u000a      Britain and Ireland, which\u000a      accounts for approximately 50% of jump racing worldwide. Flat racers -\u000a      more than 9,000 in the\u000a      UK in 2012, are also at significant risk. Stem cell treatment has advanced\u000a      equine clinical practice,\u000a      for this problem, becoming an accepted methodology internationally. A\u000a      senior Newmarket\u000a      veterinarian comments: \"A particular value is the decreased risk of\u000a        re-injury - which is consistent\u000a        with good repair of damage, rather than formation of scar tissue -\u000a        enabling successful return to\u000a        pre-injury exercise levels. The equine veterinary profession has\u000a        followed the introduction of this\u000a        novel treatment modality with great interest; many adopting it as a\u000a        significant improvement on\u000a        more traditional treatments.\" [d]. Research reference 6 was the most\u000a      downloaded paper (2,153\u000a      times) from the Equine Veterinary Journal website in 2012 [e], indicating\u000a      the interest in the value of\u000a      the technique from specialist veterinarians in this field.\u000a    Smith's published work and VetCell's success as an international market\u000a      leader in veterinary\u000a      regenerative medicine established the market opportunity for others, which\u000a      has fostered a range of\u000a      businesses using mesenchymal or adipose-derived stem cell treatments (e.g.\u000a      V-Care Biomedical\u000a      and 2F-stemcells (Germany), Equstem, Vet-Stem and Medivet America (USA),\u000a      Fat-Stem\u000a      (Belgium), Eponacell (Czech Republic), Vet Biotechnology and Regeneus\u000a      (Australia)), many of\u000a      which reference Smith's publications on their websites.[text removed for\u000a      publication].\u000a    Over 74% of racehorses treated by VetCell have successfully returned to\u000a      racing, post treatment.\u000a      Nearly 2,000 runs have been recorded post-treatment, with over 600 wins or\u000a      placings, including\u000a      the winner of the Welsh Grand National 2010 [f]. The statistically\u000a      significant reduced re-injury rate\u000a      of horses treated with stem cell therapy is also associated with welfare\u000a      benefit: Re-injury in racing\u000a      horses is likely to lead to consideration of culling. Hence the therapy\u000a      can extend the (healthy)\u000a      lifespan of the horse.\u000a    A further welfare benefit and impact through changed professional\u000a      practice, has been gained\u000a      through the switch to the new treatment: Although conventionally advised\u000a      treatment for equine\u000a      tendon injury has been a period of rest followed by a gradual return to\u000a      full `work', the controversial\u000a      practice of thermocautery or `firing' (the application of a red-hot firing\u000a      iron, or occasionally liquid\u000a      nitrogen to induce scar tissue,) is still used. A professional racehorse\u000a      trainer [g], commented :\u000a      \"The welfare impact of this [stem cell] therapy is to have certainly\u000a        helped reduce the amount of\u000a        firing that takes place and certainly it has helped the horses that have\u000a        been able to return to full\u000a        athletic function after treatment, by not having had to be considered\u000a        for culling.\"\u000a    Since 2008, VetCell has received more than &#163;250,000 in European funding\u000a      and from the\u000a      Technology Strategy Board to develop its stem cell technologies for human\u000a      application. RVC has\u000a      been a sub-contractor or collaborator on each of the projects. Human phase\u000a      II clinical trials for\u000a      Achilles tendinopathy have ethical approval and acceptance from the UK\u000a      Medicines and\u000a      Healthcare products Regulatory Agency based on protocols and results from\u000a      equine therapy [h].\u000a      The trials are proceeding with funding from the UK Stem Cell Foundation. A\u000a      Consultant\u000a      Orthopaedic Surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital commented:\u000a      \"...the approval and funding for trialling a human application, based\u000a        on a body of equine research\u000a        and clinical experience is an outcome of notable significance.\" [i]\u000a      Adaptation of autologous stem cell treatment to the intra-synovial\u000a      environment, for human rotator\u000a      cuff injury is also underway at RVC with funding from the Medical Research\u000a      Council [j]. The\u000a      Nuffield Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Oxford has\u000a      commented:\u000a      \"Although the ramifications of this work on human health have yet to be\u000a        realised, the equine results\u000a        and their acceptance as a basis to advance to an intra-synovial human\u000a        treatment represent a\u000a        significant impact on human clinical medicine.

Hence it is of\u000a        particular note that Professor Smith's autologous mesenchymal stem cell\u000a        therapy for equine\u000a        injuries of the superficial digital flexor tendon has been pioneering in\u000a        this field.\" [k]\u000a    In addition to the impacts on professional practice and health, stem cell\u000a      therapies have attracted\u000a      much public interest, and consequently, this work has been taken up widely\u000a      in the media. Smith's\u000a      work has been widely cited in discussion and review articles relating to\u000a      the opportunity and\u000a      potential for, and ethics of, human treatment as well as the existing\u000a      veterinary applications, and so\u000a      contributing more generally to the public understanding of and interest in\u000a      healthcare science [l,\u000a      m,n].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Fundamental and applied research at RVC has led to introduction of stem\u000a      cell therapy supporting\u000a      equine tendon regeneration, advancing equine clinical practice\u000a      internationally.

Their earlier work\u000a      proposed energy released\u000a      from equine tendons in their spring-like action was partly responsible for\u000a      their degeneration. The\u000a      philosophy of Professor Lanyon's (Professor of Veterinary Anatomy from\u000a      1984; Principal from\u000a      1989) pioneering work on bone &#8212; to elucidate how a tissue's mechanical\u000a      properties adapted to the\u000a      strains imparted by normal locomotion and informed the importance of\u000a      restoring a tissue's\u000a      properties to achieve effective healing in any repair process &#8212; was\u000a      therefore extended to tendon.\u000a      Wilson's work led to measuring and then modelling function of\u000a      musculoskeletal tissue in moving\u000a      animals to understand more about how muscles and tendons work to achieve\u000a      high athletic\u000a      performance [1] and showing that exercise altered the crimp morphology at\u000a      the tendon core [2].\u000a      This initial fundamental work inspired multi-disciplinary approaches and\u000a      translational research in\u000a      tendon biology.\u000a    Goodship's applied research showed that tendon injury was associated with\u000a      changes in its\u000a      extracellular matrix [3] predisposing it to partial rupture and\u000a      post-injury weakness. He collaborated\u000a      with Professor Roger Smith (following a Clinical Residency (1990) and PhD,\u000a      Lecturer in Equine\u000a      Surgery before becoming Professor of Equine Orthopaedics in 2003) and they\u000a      generated a\u000a      hypothesis that mature tendon lacks the ability to respond to strain and\u000a      that tendonopathy probably\u000a      occurs in horses and human athletes due to cumulative fatigue damage\u000a      causing degeneration at\u000a      the molecular level [4].\u000a    These fundamental and clinical observations led to the innovative idea\u000a      that mesenchymal stem\u000a      cells could help tendon injuries heal, by providing cells with potential\u000a      to respond to strain as tendon\u000a      would during growth and\/or by altering the environment in the tendon\u000a      sheath to effect tissue\u000a      regeneration of biomechanically strong tendon rather than scar tissue\u000a      formation leaving the tendon\u000a      vulnerable to future injury. In 2002, RVC filed a UK priority patent\u000a      application relating to treatment\u000a      of equine tendon injury using autologous stem cells taken from the sternum\u000a      and expanded in in\u000a        vitro culture and span-out a company to commercialise the approach.\u000a      A paper describing the\u000a      clinical technique, which has changed clinical practice, was published in\u000a      2003 [5].

The appointment in 1996, of\u000d\u000a      Professors Alan Wilson (Lecturer\u000d\u000a      in Physiology, then Senior Lecturer, progressing to Chair in Locomotion\u000d\u000a      Biomechanics) and Allen\u000d\u000a      Goodship, (Chair in Orthopaedic Sciences; Emeritus since 2011), developed\u000d\u000a      this field to consider\u000d\u000a      an integrated approach to musculoskeletal function in domestic animals.\u000d\u000a      Strategic appointments in\u000d\u000a      2003 added evolutionary biology, scaling and greater depth in computer\u000d\u000a      modelling, engineering\u000d\u000a      and mathematical approaches to study the constraints size puts on\u000d\u000a      locomotion. John Hutchinson\u000d\u000a      was a key appointment (as Lecturer in, and since 2011, Professor of,\u000d\u000a      Evolutionary Biomechanics).\u000d\u000a      His research has provided fundamental insights into how giant land animals\u000d\u000a      stand and move, and\u000d\u000a      how gravitational constraints increasingly come to dominate the form and\u000d\u000a      function of land animals\u000d\u000a      as body size increases. At giant size, animals such as elephants can no\u000d\u000a      longer do activities that\u000d\u000a      smaller animals can, such as jumping or galloping. However, they are not\u000d\u000a      restricted simply to slow\u000d\u000a      walking, either, as his research has shown. Hutchinson's team showed that\u000d\u000a      African and Asian\u000d\u000a      elephants move similarly at all ages and sizes and are restricted to\u000d\u000a      speeds &lt;25 kph (15mph),\u000d\u000a      showing hints of a bouncing kind of run (without leaving the ground) at\u000d\u000a      faster speeds [1]. In 2010,\u000d\u000a      he followed up this research by conducting ground breaking experiments\u000d\u000a      with elephants in\u000d\u000a      Thailand, using motion capture and multiple force platforms. Unlike any\u000d\u000a      other animals, elephants at\u000d\u000a      all speeds use their limbs similarly to the wheels of a 4WD vehicle,\u000d\u000a      sharing the roles of braking and\u000d\u000a      propulsion equally rather than dividing those roles between the fore and\u000d\u000a      hind limbs respectively.\u000d\u000a      This unique mechanism seems to give them a smoother `ride' that keeps limb\u000d\u000a      forces low, making\u000d\u000a      their slow walking quite efficient [2].\u000d\u000a    Hutchinson has also applied modern biomechanical techniques to\u000d\u000a      understanding the behaviour\u000d\u000a      and evolution of extinct animals. In 2009 he was the senior author on two\u000d\u000a      influential studies using\u000d\u000a      the techniques he had pioneered to study dinosaur locomotion. These\u000d\u000a      studies showed that bipedal\u000d\u000a      dinosaurs probably had metabolic costs of locomotion that were too high to\u000d\u000a      be fuelled by an\u000d\u000a      ectothermic (\"cold-blooded\") metabolism, and that even giant dinosaurs\u000d\u000a      such as Tyrannosaurus\u000d\u000a        rex might have been able to move at slow running speeds in a rather\u000d\u000a      crouched posture, but were\u000d\u000a      not fast runners like modern racehorses as some palaeontologists have\u000d\u000a      argued [3,4]. In 2011 he\u000d\u000a      showed how different parts of the body of Tyrannosaurus grew as\u000d\u000a      the animal increased its size by\u000d\u000a      tenfold, revealing that it grew about twice as fast as previously\u000d\u000a      estimated and had some of the\u000d\u000a      largest leg muscles known for any animal, extinct or extant, which made\u000d\u000a      the smaller and younger\u000d\u000a      individuals particularly adept at running when compared to their giant\u000d\u000a      relatives [5].\u000d\u000a    The work has implications for fast growing domestic animals where growth\u000d\u000a      rate places significant\u000d\u000a      strains on their skeleton and leads to health and welfare problems.

The US\u000d\u000a      Department of Agriculture reports 7.9% heifer mortality. All perinatal and\u000d\u000a      rearing losses have an economic impact, but dairy heifers only become\u000d\u000a      profitable half way through their 2nd lactation, recouping the average\u000d\u000a      &#163;1,300 it costs to rear them (circa 20% of dairy farm costs). Hence it is\u000d\u000a      critically important to optimise rearing to ensure sufficient heifers\u000d\u000a      reach adequate body size and good health &#8212; ideally for first service at 13\u000d\u000a      months &#8212; to maintain the herd. RVC's academic work in analysing the\u000d\u000a      influencing factors has been translated into practical guidance, now\u000d\u000a      modifying practices in the sector, to improve efficiency and reduce the\u000d\u000a      welfare issues associated with wastage.\u000d\u000a    DairyCo and Defra promote key messages from RVC research regarding\u000d\u000a      youngstock feeding and management [a,b]. Some advice contradicts\u000d\u000a      historical practice and expectation: e.g. Wathes's work showed group\u000d\u000a      housing of calves does not raise mortality from infection. It is generally\u000d\u000a      recognised to have a welfare advantage, and further contributes to healthy\u000d\u000a      growth by providing peer stimulation for feeding. Monitoring growth rate\u000d\u000a      through as simple a means as measuring heart girth regularly, and managing\u000d\u000a      feeding practices accordingly, has been shown to lead to optimal growth\u000d\u000a      giving higher fertility, higher milk yield per day of life and improved\u000d\u000a      longevity [c]. Feed supplier and calf-rearing specialist, Volac\u000d\u000a      International, has distributed 800 - 1,000 weigh-tapes (300 in Ireland,\u000d\u000a      200 in Czech Republic and remainder in UK) to facilitate this approach.\u000d\u000a      The employment of RVC post-doc, Jessica Cooke (n&#233;e Brickell), as Young\u000d\u000a      Animal Technical Specialist by Volac, has driven implementation of\u000d\u000a      research findings [d]. HST Feeds also directly references Wathes's\u000d\u000a      research &#8212; emphasising the lifetime profitability parameters &#8212; in their\u000d\u000a      `Next Generation Heifer' feeding programme [e].\u000d\u000a    The new advice has also been promulgated via the media: the `Stop the\u000d\u000a      Loss' campaign, launched in 2011, based largely on RVC research data and\u000d\u000a      championed by Tim Potter, an RVC alumnus who also completed specialist\u000d\u000a      clinical training at RVC, and now a practising veterinarian, highlights\u000d\u000a      this economic and welfare issue. The campaign has the support of major\u000d\u000a      industry stakeholders across animal feed, health and housing, and food\u000d\u000a      sectors [f]. Similarly, `Successful Heifer Rearing to Increase Herd\u000d\u000a      Profits', reporting RVC's work, is featured on The DairySite, a recognised\u000d\u000a      information source for farmers internationally [g].\u000d\u000a    In parallel with economic considerations, the welfare issues from wastage\u000d\u000a      identified in RVC's research have been highlighted by the Cattle Health\u000d\u000a      and Welfare Group (CHAWG). The Dairy Cattle Welfare Strategy of 2010 [h]\u000d\u000a      (drawing on the Farm Animal Welfare Committee's 2009 report to government,\u000d\u000a      citing RVC research [reference 4]) notes: \"Further promotion of best\u000d\u000a        practice methods for calf rearing and feeding to dairy farmers would\u000d\u000a        also be beneficial.\" Its 2012 report identified progress in this\u000d\u000a      area: \"The increased publicity given by the farming press to the Stop\u000d\u000a        the Loss campaign is to be welcomed whilst the National Youngstock\u000d\u000a        Association is a further step in the right direction.\" [i]. The\u000d\u000a      Chairman of CHAWG commented further: \"RVC's research and dissemination\u000d\u000a        of research findings is contributing to a significant change in the\u000d\u000a        approach to management of calves, to reduce loss and ensure healthy\u000d\u000a        growth, and particularly in monitoring heifers for efficient herd\u000d\u000a        replacement in dairy farming.\" [j]\u000d\u000a    Farm veterinary practices are also now promoting practical action to\u000d\u000a      their clients, such as attention to health and diet indicated from regular\u000d\u000a      weighing and measuring of youngstock. The President of the British Cattle\u000d\u000a      Veterinary Association comments: \"Fundamental research at RVC is\u000d\u000a        strongly linked to industry involvement ...

The Head of\u000d\u000a      Research &amp; Development at DairyCo, comments: \"[This] work has\u000d\u000a        informed much of our recent guidance on the key topics of youngstock\u000d\u000a        feeding and managing herd replacements...

A Q&amp;A sheet highlights RVC's work on the association between a\u000d\u000a      leptin gene polymorphism and perinatal mortality &#8212; which may now be used\u000d\u000a      in selection of animals in breeding for herd replacements [o].\u000d\u000a    Much of the research has been undertaken on Holstein-Friesian cattle in the\u000d\u000a    UK, the principal dairy breed worldwide. However, work on substantial\u000d\u000a    datasets of Chinese Holsteins has led to RVC involvement in implementation\u000d\u000a    of approaches to impact on the issue in China, through collaboration with\u000d\u000a    Huazhong Agricultural University and the largest dairy farm (3,000 cattle)\u000d\u000a    in the Hubei Province. The Director of that farm comments: \"Research\u000d\u000a      results from Professor Wathes's team at the Royal Veterinary College have\u000d\u000a      been highly influential in raising awareness of the level of calf\u000d\u000a      mortality and how farming practices can be modified to reduce losses &#8212;\u000d\u000a      both during rearing nd in culling sub-fertile stock... This dissemination\u000d\u000a      [...] to opinion leaders in the Chinese dairy sector is now being\u000d\u000a      implemented in our farm practice.\" [p].\u000d\u000a    Wathes, as a key opinion leader, has contributed more generally to the\u000d\u000a      dissemination of RVC findings and consequent advice to the industry\u000d\u000a      sector: she has been invited to give keynote presentations at major\u000d\u000a      international conferences, including those held in Karlstad, Sweden,\u000d\u000a      (2011) and Wuhan, China, (2009, 2011).\u000d\u000a    The most recent funding of Wathes by DairyCo incorporates support for a\u000d\u000a      wide-reaching programme of events across the UK, (average of 1 per month)\u000d\u000a      targeting UK farms, commencing in 2012 and continuing beyond the REF\u000d\u000a      Impact period, to reinforce the messages to deliver economic impact [q]. A\u000d\u000a      workshop focusing on calf health organised in July 2013 at RVC attracted\u000d\u000a      50 participants from stakeholders across the farming sector. Feedback\u000d\u000a      indicated broad influence of the RVC research amongst delegates in\u000d\u000a      different roles in industry and the public sector. (N.B. The diverse\u000d\u000a      audience meant that not all questions &#8212; intended mainly for farmers and\u000d\u000a      veterinarians &#8212; were relevant to all participants.) 75% (27\/36) reported\u000d\u000a      changed professional practice, with 81-93% (of 25) following guidance\u000d\u000a      suggested by research outputs.

Her work has centred on farmed livestock (mainly dairy cattle\u000d\u000a      and sheep) and complemented that of Neil Stickland, (Senior Lecturer in\u000d\u000a      Anatomy from 1984 and Professor of Veterinary Anatomy from 1994 until his\u000d\u000a      retirement in 2011) who researched fetal programming of muscle growth.\u000d\u000a      Through collaboration with RVC clinical experts (Michael McGowan &#8212;\u000d\u000a      Professor of Farm Animal Medicine and Surgery 2000 - 2005) and\u000d\u000a      epidemiologists (Dirk Pfeiffer &#8212; Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology from\u000d\u000a      1999) she has conducted research from the molecular to whole animal and\u000d\u000a      population levels. She has produced data from both experimental and\u000d\u000a      commercially reared cattle and thus translated her findings into practical\u000d\u000a      recommendations for industry, to improve guidelines for the rearing of\u000d\u000a      replacement dairy heifers to promote their welfare and improve longevity\u000d\u000a      and productivity. Her research has highlighted the scale of the wastage\u000d\u000a      problem in the dairy industry &#8212; in terms of both economic loss and welfare\u000d\u000a      concerns of calf illness and poor growth &#8212; pinpointing reasons for the\u000d\u000a      wastage at different stages.\u000d\u000a    Wathes first demonstrated that the level of maternal nutrition can\u000d\u000a      influence both the endocrine system (somatotrophic axis) and organ\u000d\u000a      development in fetal lambs [1]. Her research then showed that some\u000d\u000a      fertility problems due to ovarian dysfunction in the first lactation of\u000d\u000a      cows could be predicted based on measurements of the somatotrophic axis\u000d\u000a      made in the same animals at only 6 months of age [2]. This supported her\u000d\u000a      hypothesis that early life events were important in determining subsequent\u000d\u000a      performance but did not at this stage differentiate genetic from\u000d\u000a      environmental factors.\u000d\u000a    As dairy cattle are still growing during their first pregnancy, Wathes\u000d\u000a      hypothesised this would lead to undernutrition of the fetus with\u000d\u000a      preferential partitioning of nutrients for maternal growth, influencing\u000d\u000a      calf development. This proved correct but she also showed that the\u000d\u000a      offspring of heifers catch up within 3 months and fertility was generally\u000d\u000a      better in offspring of primiparous than multiparous dams [3]. She next\u000d\u000a      took an epidemiological approach to investigate the effect of growth\u000d\u000a      parameters and metabolic indices during the rearing period on subsequent\u000d\u000a      fertility and milk production, recruiting Holstein-Friesian heifers from\u000d\u000a      19 UK farms. Increased growth rates in the first 3 months of life were\u000d\u000a      indeed associated with a reduced age at first calving (AFC) [4]. This\u000d\u000a      paper concluded that heifer management should be improved by systematic\u000d\u000a      growth monitoring during rearing. In subsequent related work using DNA\u000d\u000a      samples from the same animals, Wathes' group identified associations\u000d\u000a      between growth rate and fertility of heifers and single nucleotide\u000d\u000a      polymorphisms in genes including leptin, opening the possibility that\u000d\u000a      genotyping could assist in selection of herd replacements [5]. This work\u000d\u000a      led to a major collaboration with China, which has a rapidly expanding\u000d\u000a      dairy industry, which showed that similar issues over heifer management,\u000d\u000a      exacerbated by environmental conditions, was also limiting the survival\u000d\u000a      and profitability of Chinese Holstein cows [6]. In a seminal review Wathes\u000d\u000a      and her colleagues placed their published (or, at the time, soon to be\u000d\u000a      published) data in the context of that of others and drew conclusions as\u000d\u000a      to how this research could be used to inform the dairy industry as to how\u000d\u000a      to reduce losses and improve welfare by maximising the number of\u000d\u000a      replacement heifers reaching productivity within 2 years [7].\u000d\u000a    Other Quality and Relevance Indicators\u000d\u000a    The quality of the science and its relevance to industry is indicated by\u000d\u000a      funding received for this work: with BBSRC, Wellcome Trust, Defra, Milk\u000d\u000a      Development Council (now DairyCo) and Innovation China UK all providing\u000d\u000a      major grants, and CASE awards with Merial, Volac and DairyCo. Claire\u000d\u000a      Wathes was awarded the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE)\u000d\u000a      Research Medal in 2006 for her work on dairy cow fertility and elected a\u000d\u000a      RASE fellow in 2009.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15622","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    AMR is a long-standing and escalating problem in both human and\u000a      veterinary medicine. In addition, it is now well recognised that one may\u000a      impact upon the other. For example, cross-resistance to fluoroquinolones\u000a      used in human treatment may be caused by veterinary use of a drug of the\u000a      same class. Fluoroquinolones have applications as easy-to-use first or\u000a      second-line therapeutics for intractable systemic infections, with major\u000a      herd health implications in food-producing animals. Consequently, it is\u000a      important economically and from an animal welfare perspective to maintain\u000a      their efficacy through prudent use and dosage optimisation. In 2008, 2\u000a      tonnes of fluoroquinolones were used in food production animals in the UK,\u000a      from a total of 384 tonnes of therapeutic AMDs.\u000a    Following a rise in human fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter\u000a      infections in the USA, possibly associated with consumption of poultry, in\u000a      2005 the FDA withdrew approval for use of enrofloxacin in poultry. This\u000a      was a seminal event:- the first time an animal drug had been removed from\u000a      sale because of potentially associated emergence of resistance in humans.\u000a      It led to subsequent drug evaluation using a system that focused on\u000a      probability of AMR emergence and, specifically, the probability of that\u000a      resistance transferring to human infectious disease therapy &#8212; particularly\u000a      for drugs such as fluoroquinolones &#8212; that are essential for treatment of\u000a      life threatening infections in both humans and animals. In Europe,\u000a      regulatory authorities have taken a similar approach [a].\u000a    Through his published research and direct advocacy, Lees has contributed\u000a      substantially to these changes in veterinary drug registration practice:\u000a      both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) now emphasise the\u000a      importance of PK\/PD modelling to establish doses that eradicate the\u000a      bacterial infection as well as providing a clinical cure.\u000a    The 2006-2010 Antimicrobial Strategy of the EMA Committee for Medicinal\u000a      Products in Veterinary Use (CVMP) noted \"... possibilities to further use\u000a      PK-PD modelling in the establishment of best dose and dosing regimen\" [b].\u000a      Their Strategy on AMDs for 2011 &#8212; 2015 focuses strongly on the importance\u000a      of measures to minimise risks from AMR. However, in reviewing the previous\u000a      strategy document it notes that PK-PD modelling had only been addressed at\u000a      a product level, rather than being adopted in revised general guidance\u000a      [c]. The revised Guideline has now been produced, which states where PK\/PD\u000a      relationships are well established \"... it may be possible to omit\u000a      dose-determination studies\" and run clinical trials testing one or a very\u000a      few regimens [d]. Consequently, Lees's work and advocacy has also made a\u000a      contribution to animal welfare through a reduction in experimental animal\u000a      use.\u000a    Lees has been instrumental in providing guidance and ensuring\u000a      implementation of this integrated PK\/PD approach. The Office for New\u000a      Animal Drug Evaluation at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, US Food and\u000a      Drug Administration acknowledges this [e]: \"Dr Lees has served as a source\u000a      of invaluable contributions to the body of knowledge impacting the\u000a      development and use of veterinary pharmaceuticals. From an informational\u000a      perspective, the community of veterinary clinical pharmacology experts\u000a      have a far greater understanding of pharmacokinetics (PK), interspecies\u000a      differences, and exposure-response relationships (PK\/PD) through his\u000a      published works.\" The Head of Veterinary Medicines and Product Data\u000a      Management at the EMA also recognises this contribution [f]: \"Recognising\u000a      that the production of scientific papers alone is often insufficient in\u000a      itself to change regulatory practice, Professor Lees has been a vocal\u000a      advocate for the integration into regulatory guidance of the principles\u000a      supported by his research.\" This has included delivery of invited seminars\u000a      to assist in up-skilling members of regulatory bodies and policy makers.\u000a      These presentations have focussed on both improving understanding of the\u000a      application of PK\/PD modelling to optimise dosage selection for avoiding\u000a      AMR, and on effective drug registration policies to minimise AMR in\u000a      production animal and human medicine. Lees presented to the CVMP's annual\u000a      symposium in 2005 and 2008. In 2011, he delivered a series of similar\u000a      presentations for members of Defra and the Veterinary Medicines\u000a      Directorate (VMD). Through his position as a Council member of the Royal\u000a      College of Veterinary Surgeons, Lees has contributed to the formal\u000a      `Technical Engagement' for the next UK five year Antimicrobial Resistance\u000a      (AMR) strategy and action plan, which the Department of Health has been\u000a      developing in collaboration with Defra [g].\u000a    Lees's PK\/PD integration\/modelling approach has been disseminated, and\u000a      its uptake by industry advanced, through conventional publication and\u000a      conference presentations, including invited plenary lectures at major\u000a      conferences for the scientific, regulatory and veterinary communities,\u000a      such as the European Association for Veterinary Pharmacology and\u000a      Toxicology Congresses, 2009 and 2012. He has been a member of all\u000a      organising committees of: the bi-annual International Congresses on\u000a      Antimicrobial Agents in Veterinary Medicine since 2002 and the tri-annual\u000a      European Association for Veterinary Pharmacology Congresses since 1988.\u000a    The move towards assessment of drug approvals based on AMR risk alongside\u000a      clinical benefit has, of course, been mirrored by changes in industry\u000a      research and development, to assemble data that meet the regulators'\u000a      requirements. Lees has undertaken much of his work in collaboration with\u000a      animal health companies, demonstrating selection of optimised treatment\u000a      regimens through PK\/PD modelling. To gain and preserve their market\u000a      approvals, animal health companies are keen to show that, prudently used\u000a      at an appropriate dose rates, their drugs will minimise AMR risk. For safe\u000a      and practical field application they need to balance selection of higher\u000a      dosages to ensure bacterial eradication against possible host toxicity and\u000a      economic viability, with regard to the cost of the treatment [h].\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dose selection for antimicrobial drug (AMD) use is fundamentally\u000a      important in avoiding the emergence and subsequent spread of antimicrobial\u000a      resistance (AMR), as well as for ensuring a successful clinical outcome.\u000a      RVC's pioneering research and expertise in pharmacokinetic\/\u000a      pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) integration and modelling for veterinary\u000a      applications has introduced a novel, rigorous scientific method to dosage\u000a      regimen design, which has been implemented in veterinary AMD registration,\u000a      guiding national and international licensing authorities.

Peter Lees (Professor of Pharmacology, Emeritus from 2004) has\u000a      made a significant contribution to this research in the veterinary field,\u000a      with reference to effective AMD usage, whilst minimising the risk of\u000a      emergence of AMR. The work developed at RVC has been facilitated by\u000a      collaboration with Professor Pierre-Louis Toutain of the French National\u000a      Veterinary School at Toulouse (Visiting Professor of the RVC 2008-10).\u000a    Initial studies conducted in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo established the\u000a      PK\/PD paradigm for dosage selection of AMDs [1]. This led to the\u000a      generation of dosage proposals for marbofloxacin in calves. Subsequently,\u000a      work involving another fluoroquinolone, danofloxacin, generated similar\u000a      data for sheep [2]. This work clearly demonstrated that fluoroquinolones\u000a      exhibit a concentration-dependent killing effect against field strains of\u000a      veterinary pathogens in biological fluids. PK\/PD modelling approaches have\u000a      since been critical in demonstrating the in vivo efficacy of\u000a      fluoroquinolone drugs, and have been responsible for key revisions in\u000a      registered dosage regimens. Lees extended his work on ex vivo\u000a      pharmacodynamic data involving relevant veterinary pathogens modelled with\u000a      in vivo pharmacokinetic data to in vivo PK\/PD modelling, using an\u000a      experimental model of calf pneumonia relevant to clinical use (in\u000a      collaboration with the Moredun Research Institute and Pfizer Animal Health\u000a      (now Zoetis)). A landmark paper on danofloxacin [3], showed the\u000a      concentration-dependent killing action of danofloxacin in pneumonic calves\u000a      and collaboration with Pfizer Animal Health led to a pronounced revision\u000a      of the dosage schedule from 1.25 to 6.0 mg\/kg to optimise treatment based\u000a      on this understanding. The same principles are now being applied by RVC\u000a      researchers, with BBSRC CIDLID funding, to contagious bovine\u000a      pleuropneumonia in Kenya with the goal of informing optimal AMD dosing to\u000a      tackle this intractable health problem in indigenous cattle [4].\u000a    Because of the importance and clinical relevance of Lees's early studies,\u000a      DEFRA commissioned him to undertake a four year programme in 2006 to\u000a      examine dosing regimens for five classes of AMDs used in the treatment of\u000a      calf pneumonia. This programme involved a comprehensive and progressive\u000a      approach, starting with in vitro and ex vivo\u000a      pharmacodynamic studies conducted in biological fluids [5], PK\/PD\u000a      modelling informed by tissue cage experiments in healthy calves [6] and by\u000a      an experimental disease model (calf pneumonia) [7,8], population\u000a      pharmacokinetics of tulathromycin in field cases of calf pneumonia, and\u000a      Monte Carlo simulations to propose optimal dose rates [7,8]. His data\u000a      challenged the conventional approach of using artificial media in studies\u000a      of AMD potency, and demonstrated distinct differences in pharmacokinetic\u000a      profiles of AMDs between infected and healthy calves; such differences, if\u000a      known, can be allowed for when evaluating dosage regimens for novel\u000a      agents. Of particular relevance to AMR, the studies demonstrated how\u000a      readily relatively stable resistance can arise following administration of\u000a      a single therapeutic dose (recommended on the label) &#8212; by persistence of\u000a      partial resistance at four weeks to tulathromycin in enterococci and\u000a      Escherichia coli harvested from calf faeces. [7,8]\u000a    The use of a population pharmacokinetic approach with limited sampling\u000a      analysed by Monte Carlo simulation added to the data obtained ex vivo,\u000a      and coupled with an in vivo challenge model has set the gold\u000a      standard for future research and development of AMDs for veterinary\u000a      medicine.\u000a    His report to DEFRA demonstrated the major deficiencies of the\u000a      conventional dose-titration approach to dose selection, which generally\u000a      leads to a clinically effective dose but one which is sub-optimal in\u000a      achieving bacteriological cure [8].\u000a    Further quality indicators\u000a    Lees has received many awards of international standing, including the\u000a      Selbourne Award of the Association of Veterinary Teachers and Research\u000a      Workers in 2004 and the Lloyd E Davis Award of the American Academy of\u000a      Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, for lifetime achievements in\u000a      veterinary pharmacology, in 2007.\u000a      Lees.

Providing a first\u000a      estimate of the contribution of missed infection to the on-going epidemic\u000a      has stimulated the debate and public understanding of cattle controls,\u000a      leading to questions being raised in both the Scottish ParliamentB\u000a      and WestminsterC,D. The draft strategy for Achieving\u000a      \"Officially Bovine Tuberculosis-Free\" status for EnglandE\u000a      (Published 4th July 2013) uses our research to justify\u000a      strengthening herd level control policies in both high and low risk areas\u000a      &#8212; and in the edge area between them. \u000a    The close working relationships fostered between the DDU, Defra and the\u000a      Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) from the outset\u000a      of `the problem herd' project, based around a `pathways to impact'\u000a      approach, has enabled the group's subsequent scientific outputs to be\u000a      tailored towards the needs of policy development from the start. Thus, the\u000a      combined research outcomes of the work described in section 2 have\u000a      provided the robust body of evidence that has quantified the effectiveness\u000a      of Defra's cattle control strategies for bTB clarifying where improvements\u000a      need to be focussed. It also demonstrated that outbreak persistence has\u000a      most likely resulted from reintroduction of infection from extrinsic\u000a      sources. DEFRA has recognised the profound implications for policy. For\u000a      example, much bTB research in the UK in recent years has been focused on\u000a      the development of new diagnostic tests in order to increase bTB detection\u000a      rates within affected herds, e.g. the gamma-interferon test. These results\u000a      have demonstrated that the potential for improvement in the resolution of\u000a      bTB incidents from novel tests is severely constrained by a high rate of\u000a      re-introduction of infection into herds. Clearing infection from herds\u000a      will therefore only have limited impact if we do not also reduce the\u000a      exogenous exposure of herds to infection.\u000a    In terms of overall engagement with policy makers, Professor Wood and\u000a      colleagues have presented to the following Defra TB committees:\u000a    \u000a      TB Eradication Group, 16\/11\/2011 (at the time the highest\u000a        non-ministerial Defra TB committee, but now superseded by TBEAG).

This has been demonstrated by Wood and\u000a      Conlan being commissioned by Northern Ireland (NI) policy makers to model\u000a      within-herd and extrinsic transmission of bTB in NI; this work is due to\u000a      start in spring 2014J.\u000a    Public understanding of bTB control in cattle\u000a      This work, especially that published by Conlan et al (2012), has\u000a      stimulated significant public debate and thereby increased public\u000a      understanding of the disease and its control.

Dr McKinley joined DDU\u000a      in 2006, and Dr Conlan in 2008, both initially as research associates;\u000a      both have now gained independence since 2011 having written successful\u000a      grant applications as named post-doctoral scientists. Dr Brooks-Pollock\u000a      joined the department\/ Wood's group in 2011 funded by the EPSRC\u000a      post-doctoral fellowship above. The underpinning research focussed on the\u000a      dynamics of and the role of demography in the silent spread of bTB in\u000a      cattle in the UK, in the face of stringent statutory controls in British\u000a      cattle herds, and how this could best be addressed.\u000a    Wood's work on bTB began when he was approached by the then Veterinary\u000a      Laboratories Agency to participate in the DEFRA-funded project `Bovine\u000a      Tuberculosis: the problem herd' and built on a long-standing interest in\u000a      the dynamics of disease transmission and control. As part of this project,\u000a      which ran from 2007 to 2011, Professor Wood's team initially undertook a\u000a      series of statistical epidemiological analyses using previously collected\u000a      farm management data, with the aim of determining why bTB persisted in\u000a      approximately one third of herds for at least 240 days following an\u000a      initial positive test1. Earlier published studies had attempted\u000a      to identify bTB risk factors, but had not considered whether farm-level\u000a      characteristics had an impact on the duration of an outbreak\u000a      (`breakdown'). McKinley and Wood's novel approach, focussing on why some\u000a      breakdowns persist, demonstrated that confirmation of infection (via\u000a      post-mortem following culling after a positive test) was a strong\u000a      indicator for breakdowns that became prolonged1. Further\u000a      analyses explored likely risk factors for within-herd recurrence within 12\u000a      months of release from controls (23% of breakdowns were recurrences within\u000a      this period); this demonstrated that the number of initial positive test\u000a      reactors and the herd's prior bTB history were the most important factors\u000a      in predicting recurrence, and concluded that effective control measures\u000a      needed to consider the possible contribution of local residual infection\u000a      (via within-herd persistence in cattle or re-introduction from external\u000a      sources such as wildlife)2. Previously, controls had not\u000a      assumed that some infection was missed. The team also established, by\u000a      reanalysing data from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), that\u000a      `proactive' badger culling was associated with a reduction in disease\u000a      recurrence on cattle farms5.\u000a    In parallel, McKinley led a study that re-examined the sensitivity of the\u000a      primary bTB screening test used in Britain and Ireland; previous studies\u000a      had compared positive reactors to the test with post-mortem data from the\u000a      same, but had not included post-mortem data from skin test negative\u000a      animals, which complicated interpretation of test characteristics. The\u000a      inclusion of test-negative data in McKinley's study provided results\u000a      consistent with previous published estimates, confirming that the live\u000a      animal test failed to detect 5-25% of all `confirmed' infected animals3,\u000a      and illustrated that recurrent breakdowns could originate from undetected\u000a      infected cattle within the herd, with associated implications for the\u000a      overall national testing regime; currently, ~50% of released herds suffer\u000a      a recurrence of infection within 3 years. The significance of missed\u000a      infection is evident from the fact that 25% of herd breakdowns are now\u000a      detected in slaughterhouses in carcases from apparently healthy animals at\u000a      routine meat inspection; this figure has increased substantially over the\u000a      last 15 years.\u000a    Conlan, McKinley and Wood developed robust within-herd mathematical\u000a      transmission models4 to quantify the contribution of such\u000a      undetected infected cattle on rates of recurrence within herds. Novel\u000a      Bayesian methods were developed and used to estimate this hidden burden of\u000a      infection from measures of within-herd bTB persistence using data from all\u000a      newly infected herds in Britain in different incident areas. The models\u000a      suggest that up to 21% of herds might harbour undetected infection,\u000a      providing a first true estimate of the quantity of infection missed by\u000a      cattle testing and the possible contribution of this to within-herd\u000a      persistence4. The work also established a non-linear increase\u000a      in transmission rate of bTB with herd size, suggesting that control is\u000a      likely to be more difficult in these herds. Conlan concluded that up to\u000a      50% of recurrent breakdowns were attributable to missed infection in\u000a      cattle4. However, the work also identified that rates of\u000a      re-introduction from external sources were sufficiently high that\u000a      eliminating the hidden burden of infection would not noticeably reduce\u000a      rates of recurrence.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17090","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aPublication of the discovery of mecC in 2011 raised important questions about the detection and\u000d\u000aconfirmation of MRSA in humans, and resulting decisions about patient care.\u000d\u000aPrior to the research in this study, patients presenting with mecC-positive S. aureus were wrongly\u000d\u000adiagnosed as carrying methicillin-susceptible S. aureus rather than MRSA, given the low sequence\u000d\u000aconservation between mecC and mecA.

MRSA was\u000d\u000afirst identified in 1961 and is distinguished by the fact that it contains a mecA gene, which encodes\u000d\u000aa penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) with low affinity for &#946;-lactam antibiotics and thus confers\u000d\u000aresistance to these antibiotics, which include methicillin. The mecA gene is located on a mobile\u000d\u000astaphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) forming SCCmec. MRSA can be sub-classified as\u000d\u000ahospital acquired (HA-MRSA), community acquired (CA-MRSA) or livestock associated (LA-MRSA); the last emerged in the early 2000s and provides a reservoir of infection for both farm\u000d\u000aanimals and humans.\u000d\u000aFrom 2006 to 2010 Dr Mark Holmes (Senior Lecturer, Department of Veterinary Medicine from\u000d\u000a1991 to the present) conducted a project, jointly funded by Defra and HEFCE, investigating the\u000d\u000aepidemiology of bovine mastitis.

The failure to detect mecC\u000d\u000ausing PCR was due to the low sequence conservation between mecA and mecC, with only 60%\u000d\u000aidentity at the DNA level and 63% similarity at the amino acid level. PCR primers were designed by\u000d\u000aHolmes in 2010 to enable detection of this new MRSA.\u000d\u000aFollowing the design of these new primers, a further 13 mecC MRSA isolates were found in a\u000d\u000acollection of 940 S. aureus isolates from 465 UK cattle herds which had submitted mastitic milk\u000d\u000asamples to the UK Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA)1. The AHVLA had\u000d\u000aalready identified 24 of these isolates that had high levels of antibiotic resistance consistent with\u000d\u000aMRSA status, but were not identified as MRSA using established PCR assays (using specific\u000d\u000aprimers for mecA) and a standard slide latex agglutination test (using a monoclonal antibody\u000d\u000aspecific for the mecA-encoded PBP2a)1.

The number of calves affected in the EU is 26 million per year but\u000a      the greatest impact has been on the welfare of those calves used for veal\u000a      production. In practice, our data have influenced further changes in\u000a      systems after that date as farmers developed their housing systems. The\u000a      subsequent 2006 and 2012 EFSA reports and consideration by EU Member State\u000a      Ministers have resulted in the ban being continued, e.g. see UK\u000a      legislation 2007 and 2012. Legislation and codes of practice that prevent\u000a      the keeping of calves in small crates have been initiated in many\u000a      countries following this work. Between 2006 and 2009, five USA States have\u000a      banned the use of small crates for veal calves. These results were quoted\u000a      in many television programmes and newspaper articles, as well as by Farm\u000a      Animal Welfare Council and in EU reviews. The EU scientific reports on\u000a      calf welfare referred to CAWA work.\u000a    The welfare of laying hens: paper 3. (references\u000a        in 5.3) This paper and other CAWA publications were quoted in EU\u000a      scientific reports and led to EU Directive 1999.74\/EC. banning the\u000a      use of battery cages in the EU. This was mainly implemented in the three\u000a      years leading up to the obligatory change date of 1st January\u000a      2012. It has affected the vast majority of the millions of laying hens in\u000a      the EU. Similar legislation, referring to our work, has been passed in\u000a      some USA states and codes of practice of supermarket and restaurant chains\u000a      in several countries refer to our work, the most recent being the\u000a      announcement late in 2012 of a ban on battery cages in New Zealand.\u000a    Welfare of farm animals during transport: paper 4. (references\u000a        in 5.4) Our research was quoted in EU reports by the Scientific\u000a      Veterinary Committee, The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and\u000a      Welfare (2002) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA 2004 and 2011)\u000a      and led to provisions in the EU Regulation 14305\/04 on the Protection\u000a        of Animals During Transport (2004). The European Commission is\u000a      preparing a revision to this, using research results from Professor Broom\u000a      and other researchers. The research also led to Recommendations, binding\u000a      in 170 countries, by the World Organisation for Animal Health (O.I.E.)\u000a      following a report by the Working Group on Land Transport chaired by\u000a      D.M.Broom. The O.I.E. Code detailing this was published in 2012. This and\u000a      many other CAWA papers were quoted in television programmes, newspaper\u000a      articles and scientific reviews.\u000a    Scientific information on animal welfare and its assessment:\u000a        publications 5 and 6.

In relation to\u000a      the Animal Welfare Act, Prof Broom submitted evidence to Defra, answered\u000a      questions from Defra and had several discussions in person, by telephone\u000a      and by e-mail with Mr. Elliott Morley, the Government Minister\u000a      responsible. This Act has led to a series of prosecutions in the UK in the\u000a      years since it was passed. Information from our work has also been used in\u000a      formulating the legislation in several other countries, e.g. Malta in\u000a      2010, draft legislation in the People's Republic of China in 2009, current\u000a      plans for animal welfare legislation in Mexico. The development of\u000a      scientific studies of animal welfare has increased public debate and\u000a      understanding, has resulted in much media coverage, has led to hundreds of\u000a      new academic courses in universities around the world and has formed the\u000a      factual basis for the development of commercial standards for food of\u000a      animal origin.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out by Professor Donald Broom at the Centre for Animal\u000a      Welfare and Anthrozoology at the University of Cambridge has had a\u000a      significant impact on the policy and practice surrounding farm animal\u000a      welfare in the UK and beyond.

CAWA research explored the\u000a      physiological and psychological effects of confinement on sows, assessing\u000a      measures of adrenal function, behaviour (including stereotypies), bone\u000a      strength, immune system function and opioid receptor density in the brains\u000a      of animals kept in confined conditions compared with those that were\u000a      loose-housed. This work demonstrated the various ways in which sow welfare\u000a      was poorer when confined in stalls than when in loose-housing systems. The\u000a      listed 1995 publication1 is selected from 28 CAWA papers (Broom\u000a      D.M. PI and Post-Docs Mendl M., Zanella A.J. and Marchant J.N.) on sow\u000a      welfare in relation to housing as it remains the most carefully controlled\u000a      comparative study in the field, and has been referred to by the major\u000a      reports on the subject. A total of 28 physiological measures, 20 behaviour\u000a      measures, three animal production measures and various health measures\u000a      were used in the study. The sows were kept in three widely used housing\u000a      conditions and were studied during four pregnancies. The paper shows the\u000a      extent to which sow welfare was worse if the sows were confined in a stall\u000a      in which they could not turn around and demonstrates no major problems if\u000a      the sows were group-housed.\u000a    Research by Broom and colleagues on the welfare of veal calves in small\u000a      crates and other individually-housed calves have demonstrated high\u000a      incidences of stereotypies and other abnormal behaviour in animals raised\u000a      in confinement2. In addition there is abnormal physiology and\u000a      failure to develop normal anatomy, when compared with group-housed\u000a      animals, as a result of dietary constraints imposed on confined animals.\u000a      This paper is one of 12 CAWA papers (Broom D.M. PI, Trunkfield H.R.) on\u000a      calf welfare but is selected because it was a review of the work and\u000a      because it has been quoted by UK and EU reviews of calf welfare. The paper\u000a      shows that the welfare of calves is poor when they are: housed\u000a      individually, given insufficient space to lie and groom normally, deprived\u000a      of fibre in their diet and given insufficient iron in their diet. A range\u000a      of behavioural, physiological and health measures is quoted.\u000a    Amongst the 12 papers on CAWA's work (Broom D.M. PI, Knowles T.G, Manser\u000a      C.E. Post-Docs, Phillips C.J.C. Senior Lecturer and member of CAWA) on\u000a      laying hen welfare are comparisons of hens from battery cages and from\u000a      aviary systems that provided evidence linking bone weakness with\u000a      inadequate exercise in small cages where wing-flapping is not possible3.\u000a      The first part of the work showed that lack of exercise in hens, as in\u000a      astronauts and elderly people, led to osteopaenia. These studies of bone\u000a      strength involved use of tensiometers in the University's Department of\u000a      Physics. The studies also demonstrated that the bone weakness resulted in\u000a      increased numbers of bone breakages during the normal commercial handling\u000a      of hens. The publications also had to explain that bone breakage is\u000a      painful for hens.\u000a    In addition to confinement studies, a parallel strand of CAWA research\u000a      explored the welfare of pigs, sheep, cattle and poultry under loading and\u000a      transport conditions. The main findings of 35+ papers (Broom D.M. PI, Hall\u000a      S.J.G. Post-doc, Bradshaw R.H. Post-doc, Parrott R.F collaborator from\u000a      Babraham Institute, Cambridge) are that: loading is normally more\u000a      stressful than travelling4, driving quality is a major variable\u000a      affecting welfare, journey duration affects welfare differentially in\u000a      different species, and stocking density affects welfare. It was possible\u000a      to come to these novel conclusions because the welfare of the animals was\u000a      studied during the journey and not just at its end, as had been the case\u000a      in most previous studies. In the quoted paper, eight physiological\u000a      indicators of the welfare of sheep transported in commercial situations\u000a      were measured. The movements of the vehicle were monitored with a\u000a      tri-axial accelerometer. The major effects on sheep welfare of the loading\u000a      procedure and of driving the sheep transport vehicle on winding roads were\u000a      clear.\u000a    Much of the research carried out by CAWA, in several hundred refereed\u000a      papers and a series of books, has clarified concepts5 and\u000a      pioneered the development of a range of indicators for quantifying animal\u000a      welfare6.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17092","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    (a) Impact on veterinary practitioners\u000d\u000a    This research has changed the way that veterinary practitioners across\u000d\u000a      the world have recognised\u000d\u000a      and treated CP in dogs over the past 5-10 years, improving the quality of\u000d\u000a      life of affected dogs.\u000d\u000a      Testimonials from veterinary surgeons in the UK, France and the USA (Refs\u000d\u000a      6 a, b and c in section\u000d\u000a      5) all corroborate the fact that this research has fundamentally changed\u000d\u000a      their recognition and\u000d\u000a      treatment of CP in dogs. Prior to our clinical study, detailed in section\u000d\u000a      2, CP was not recognised by\u000d\u000a      practising veterinary surgeons as a common cause of chronic relapsing\u000d\u000a      gastrointestinal disease,\u000d\u000a      pain, EPI and DM. Watson's work has changed veterinary treatment of\u000d\u000a      affected dogs &#8212; particularly\u000d\u000a      the recognition of pain and consequent analgesia, changing to low fat\u000d\u000a      diets and giving enzyme\u000d\u000a      supplementation to dogs with EPI. This has profoundly improved their\u000d\u000a      quality of life and in some\u000d\u000a      cases has led to the avoidance of euthanasia on humane grounds. The\u000d\u000a      managing director of\u000d\u000a      Davies Veterinary Specialists, one of the largest veterinary referral\u000d\u000a      centres in Europe, himself a\u000d\u000a      specialist in small animal medicine, has provided a testimonial and noted\u000d\u000a      in November 2012 that: `I\u000d\u000a        can honestly say your work has changed how I think about the role of\u000d\u000a        chronic pancreatic disease in\u000d\u000a        older dogs and how I practice'. This can be entirely attributed to\u000d\u000a      the work of Watson and\u000d\u000a      colleagues. There were no previous publications on CP in dogs apart from\u000d\u000a      single case reports. The\u000d\u000a      only other group working on canine CP in the world published their first\u000d\u000a      paper on the disease in\u000d\u000a      dogs in the Veterinary Journal in 2013.

Over the impact\u000d\u000a      period, Watson has\u000d\u000a      made major contributions to small-animal medicine textbooks used by\u000d\u000a      veterinary surgeons in first-opinion\u000d\u000a      practice, updating the sections on pancreatitis since 2008 to stress breed\u000d\u000a      relationships and\u000d\u000a      the importance of CP as a cause of EPI in dogs. Watson contributed the\u000d\u000a      entire section on liver and\u000d\u000a      pancreas disease in Nelson and Couto's Small Animal Internal Medicine (4th\u000d\u000a      edition, 2008), a\u000d\u000a      leading textbook on Small Animal Medicine for veterinary students and\u000d\u000a      practising veterinary\u000d\u000a      surgeons. Watson also contributed sections on pancreatitis in the BSAVA\u000d\u000a      Manual of Clinical\u000d\u000a      Pathology (2nd edition; 2005) and the BSAVA Manual of Canine\u000d\u000a      and Feline Rehabilitation,\u000d\u000a      Supportive and Palliative Care (1st Edition 2010). An invited\u000d\u000a      review in a popular USA Open Access,\u000d\u000a      practitioner-focussed review journal has widened impact to veterinary\u000d\u000a      practitioners in the USA\u000d\u000a      (Watson PJ. Topical Review: Chronic pancreatitis in dogs. Topics in\u000d\u000a        Companion Animal Medicine\u000d\u000a      27: 133-139).\u000d\u000a    (b) Impact on owners and breeders of affected dogs\u000d\u000a    This work has had far-reaching impact on owners and breeders of affected\u000d\u000a      dogs, particularly in\u000d\u000a      high-risk breeds (English Cocker Spaniel and CKCS). The results of the\u000d\u000a      research have been\u000d\u000a      disseminated by Watson, talking at breed society meetings and via internet\u000d\u000a      sites. In October 2011,\u000d\u000a      Dr Watson engaged with English Cocker Spaniel health co-ordinators at a\u000d\u000a      large breed seminar to\u000d\u000a      promote the research. The Cocker Spaniel Breed Council now lists Chronic\u000d\u000a      Pancreatitis in the\u000d\u000a      `Health schemes and Research' section of their website (listed in section\u000d\u000a      5:5) directly as a result of\u000d\u000a      this research and are asking for breeders to contact us if their dog\u000d\u000a      suffers from CP. A Cocker\u000d\u000a      Spaniel breeder has raised funds specifically for the research by\u000d\u000a      producing a leaflet and selling\u000d\u000a      home-made brooches (`Norbert's Ribbon'), demonstrating their commitment to\u000d\u000a      helping.\u000d\u000a    CKCS breeders are increasingly recognizing CP in their dogs, allowing\u000d\u000a      more effective treatment by\u000d\u000a      their veterinary surgeons. References to CP appear on a number of CKCS\u000d\u000a      health websites,\u000d\u000a      referencing our work, and increasing awareness of the disease in the\u000d\u000a      breed. For example, the\u000d\u000a      website `Cavalier Matters' has been written by breeders, demonstrating\u000d\u000a      their engagement with the\u000d\u000a      problem and their wish to advertise it further amongst breeders and owners\u000d\u000a      (see link in section\u000d\u000a      5:5). The breeder who runs this web-site has also given a testimonial\u000d\u000a      (section 5:6e) saying: `We\u000d\u000a        hope that Penny's research will one day elucidate the cause of this\u000d\u000a        horrible disease in the\u000d\u000a        breed....Meanwhile, just recognizing the disease goes a long way towards\u000d\u000a        allowing treatment to\u000d\u000a        improve the quality of life of these lovely little dogs and we can thank\u000d\u000a        Penny for allowing this to\u000d\u000a        happen'. This breeder is helping Watson's research by developing a\u000d\u000a      health questionnaire to be\u000d\u000a      filled in by owners when they donate bodies of dead CKCSs for PM. We are\u000d\u000a      coordinating this\u000d\u000a      tissue collection scheme with other researchers investigating spinal cord\u000d\u000a      and heart disease\u000d\u000a      elsewhere in the UK (see website referenced in section 5:5).\u000d\u000a    Increased awareness in owners that their animals may suffer from CP has\u000d\u000a      increased the likelihood\u000d\u000a      that they will present to their veterinary surgeon when necessary. This is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the breeder\u000d\u000a      testimonials and the large number of emails and phone calls for advice now\u000d\u000a      received by Watson\u000d\u000a      from veterinary surgeons in practice. Impact on owners in the USA is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by Watson's\u000d\u000a      contribution to an American website for owners of dogs with EPI which has\u000d\u000a      resulted in many emails\u000d\u000a      from owners in the USA and UK. The owner forum demonstrates the reach of\u000d\u000a      the impact and this\u000d\u000a      is referenced in bullet 4, section 5.\u000d\u000a    (c) Impact on Industry: marketing of diets and nutraceuticals\u000d\u000a    The results of this research have changed the way that nutraceutical and\u000d\u000a      veterinary nutrition\u000d\u000a      companies market their products. VetPlus, a global leader in veterinary\u000d\u000a      nutraceuticals and a major\u000d\u000a      supplier of pancreatic enzyme supplements used to treat dogs with EPI in\u000d\u000a      the UK, re-wrote their\u000d\u000a      brochure to include end-stage CP as an important cause of EPI in addition\u000d\u000a      to pancreatic acinar\u000d\u000a      atrophy, as a direct result of Watson's work (section 5:1). They have\u000d\u000a      produced a newsletter based\u000d\u000a      on Watson's work to use in marketing their product to increase awareness\u000d\u000a      amongst veterinary\u000d\u000a      surgeons that EPI can occur as an end stage of CP and thus in older dogs\u000d\u000a      of breeds other than\u000d\u000a      German Shepherds (section 5:1). Eukanuba (Proctor &amp; Gamble Pet Care),\u000d\u000a      a major veterinary\u000d\u000a      clinical diet manufacturer, has noted that Dr Watson's work has had a\u000d\u000a      significant impact on the way\u000d\u000a      they market their low fat diets. The Communications Manager for this\u000d\u000a      company, based in Geneva,\u000d\u000a      stated in October 2013: `This work has definitely led to more emphasis\u000d\u000a        in the marketing our\u000d\u000a        intestinal diet for chronic pancreatitis. This diet, at only 10% fat,\u000d\u000a        has been formulated to meet the\u000d\u000a        recommendation of containing low fat. I have also used the data, both\u000d\u000a        published and personal\u000d\u000a        communication shared by Dr Watson at a number of European congresses and\u000d\u000a        seminars, to help\u000d\u000a        promote the usage of this diet with general practitioners for the\u000d\u000a        optimal management of\u000d\u000a        pancreatitis. Additionally, the prevalence of chronic pancreatitis in\u000d\u000a        the canine population, as\u000d\u000a        elucidated by Dr Watson's work, provides a strong impetus for our\u000d\u000a        company to continue\u000d\u000a        communicating to the veterinary profession about this important\u000d\u000a        disease....'. (Ref 5.7c). This\u000d\u000a      company subsequently ran a lecture tour of day meetings in September 2013\u000d\u000a      in Norway for\u000d\u000a      Veterinary Surgeons with Dr Watson as the keynote lecturer entitled:\u000d\u000a      `Chronic pancreatitis in the\u000d\u000a      dog: the rediscovery of a forgotten disease'. The communications manager\u000d\u000a      stated: `We had a\u000d\u000a        tremendous response from the veterinarians and the tour attracted a\u000d\u000a        large number of delegates to\u000d\u000a        each talk. The information shared by Dr Watson was of great clinical use\u000d\u000a        to those attending and\u000d\u000a        has been very influential in promoting the use of a low fat diet as part\u000d\u000a        of the management protocol.'\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research led by Dr Watson has demonstrated that chronic pancreatitis (CP)\u000d\u000a      is more common and\u000d\u000a      clinically significant in dogs than veterinary surgeons previously\u000d\u000a      recognised, with strong breed\u000d\u000a      predispositions. Prior to this work, the veterinary profession believed\u000d\u000a      that dogs had a single attack of\u000d\u000a      acute pancreatitis which did not result in the development of exocrine\u000d\u000a      pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)\u000d\u000a      and\/or endocrine insufficiency (diabetes mellitus (DM)). The work by\u000d\u000a      Watson has shown the importance\u000d\u000a      of chronic disease and has altered the long term treatment of affected\u000d\u000a      dogs across the profession. It\u000d\u000a      has also prompted companies in the UK, Europe and the USA to increase\u000d\u000a      their focus on low-fat dietary\u000d\u000a      management, pancreatic enzyme supplementation and analgesia improving the\u000d\u000a      quality of life of\u000d\u000a      affected dogs.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Cambridge\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cambridge (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Cambridge","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"East","UKPRN":10007788}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2797656","Name":"Ghent"},{"GeoNamesId":"2660646","Name":"Genève"},{"GeoNamesId":"4335045","Name":"New Orleans"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

Watson noticed an unexpectedly high\u000d\u000a      prevalence of EPI due to\u000d\u000a      end-stage CP in clinical cases and published a small retrospective series\u000d\u000a      of histopathologically\u000d\u000a      confirmed disease in 20031. Prior to this, canine CP was\u000d\u000a      believed to be rare: the major cause of\u000d\u000a      EPI in this species was thought to be an inherited disease (pancreatic\u000d\u000a      acinar atrophy) in young\u000d\u000a      German Shepherd dogs. EPI in older dogs of other breeds was not\u000d\u000a      recognised, diagnosed or\u000d\u000a      treated, leading to profound cachexia and often humane euthanasia of\u000d\u000a      affected patients, some of\u000d\u000a      which had concurrent DM. Most cases of DM in dogs were believed to be\u000d\u000a      autoimmune and DM\u000d\u000a      due to end-stage CP was not recognised.\u000d\u000a    The retrospective case series provided the springboard for research to\u000d\u000a      define the prevalence and\u000d\u000a      clinical importance of CP in dogs. A major challenge in the non-invasive\u000d\u000a      diagnosis of CP, (shared\u000d\u000a      with human medicine), is that it requires histological examination of the\u000d\u000a      pancreas. Watson\u000d\u000a      designed and undertook a prospective pathology study in 2004 using\u000d\u000a      post-mortem (PM) material\u000d\u000a      from first-opinion practice to define the prevalence and breed association\u000d\u000a      of canine CP.

The results\u000d\u000a      showed that the\u000d\u000a      prevalence of CP in 200 old dogs (euthanased in first opinion practice for\u000d\u000a      no specific reason) was\u000d\u000a      remarkably high, at 34% 2. In addition, this study showed a\u000d\u000a      significantly increased relative risk in\u000d\u000a      some breeds including Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) and a\u000d\u000a      difference in pathological\u000d\u000a      appearance between pedigree dog breeds was noted, suggesting different\u000d\u000a      aetiologies. Some\u000d\u000a      breeds showed a duct-centred pattern typical of duct blockage or\u000d\u000a      autoimmune disease, others an\u000d\u000a      intra-acinar pattern typical of premature enzyme release in humans.

The profound and often permanent loss\u000d\u000a      of function that accompanies traumatic injury to the spinal cord results\u000d\u000a      in large part because of the failure of regeneration of damaged axons.\u000d\u000a      Axons fail to regenerate mainly because they are prevented from doing so\u000d\u000a      by the cells that accumulate at the injury site. A long-standing\u000d\u000a      experimental approach to promote recovery is to transplant into the injury\u000d\u000a      site cells that encourage axon regeneration. Although many cell types have\u000d\u000a      been transplanted in experimental models of SCI, there is a generally\u000d\u000a      accepted view that olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), a population of\u000d\u000a      cells found only in the peripheral olfactory system where axon growth\u000d\u000a      occurs continually as a normal physiological process, are the most\u000d\u000a      promising. However, nearly all previous studies have been undertaken using\u000d\u000a      experimental injury in laboratory animals, where the tight control of\u000d\u000a      variables and the often slight functional improvement does not necessarily\u000d\u000a      accurately predict how such an approach will translate into clinical\u000d\u000a      trials in larger species, especially humans. Profs Franklin and Jeffery\u000d\u000a      proposed using domestic dogs, where impact injury to the spinal cord is\u000d\u000a      relatively common due to disc extrusions and accidents, as a suitable\u000d\u000a      translational model. This model address both the issue of `scaling up'\u000d\u000a      from rodents to humans and the more challenging issue of whether the\u000d\u000a      intervention was clinically effective, since SCI in domestic dogs is\u000d\u000a      naturally occurring and not experimental. The partnership between Franklin\u000d\u000a      and Jeffery made the DVM uniquely placed to undertake this study. Franklin\u000d\u000a      is a pioneer of OEC transplantation (both rodent and human) and the basis\u000d\u000a      of their regenerative function, while Jeffery, a veterinary neurologist,\u000d\u000a      has a long-standing interest in clinical canine SCI.\u000d\u000a    Following on from the experimental work in the Franklin laboratory of\u000d\u000a      rodent (started in 1996 and continued to the present) and human (2000)\u000d\u000a      OECs it was established that adult dog OECs can be readily grown in tissue\u000d\u000a      culture [1]. It was subsequently established that these could be harvested\u000d\u000a      and grown from the dog frontal sinus with minimal trauma [2]. In parallel,\u000d\u000a      techniques were developed for the digitalisation, quantification and\u000d\u000a      detailed analysis of canine gait using infrared cameras &#8212; an essential\u000d\u000a      element of the outcome measures by which the efficacy of cell transplants\u000d\u000a      could be assessed [3, 4]. An initial Phase 1 trial by Franklin and\u000d\u000a      Jeffery, funded by the International Spinal Research Trust, established\u000d\u000a      that transplantation of autologous OECs, expanded ex vivo, into clinical\u000d\u000a      (i.e. non-experimental) SCI was a safe procedure with no serious adverse\u000d\u000a      consequences [5]. This then led to the MRC supporting a Phase 2 clinical\u000d\u000a      trial led by Franklin and Jeffery, the first veterinary clinical trial\u000d\u000a      supported by the MRC, in which the efficacy of autologous OEC\u000d\u000a      transplantation was assessed in a range of outcome measures of both\u000d\u000a      locomotor and autonomic function [6]. Twenty dogs with severe stable SCI\u000d\u000a      (equivalent to ASIA grade A human patients) were transplanted with OECs\u000d\u000a      and compared over a six-month period with 10 similarly affected dogs\u000d\u000a      transplanted with cell transport medium alone. Recipients of cell\u000d\u000a      transplants gained significantly better fore-hind coordination than those\u000d\u000a      dogs receiving cell transport medium alone. Thus, intraspinal OEC\u000d\u000a      transplantation improves communication across the damaged region of the\u000d\u000a      injured spinal cord, even in chronically injured individuals.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21957","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The importance of upland hay meadows\u000d\u000a    Species-rich upland hay meadows are an important part of the UK's\u000d\u000a      cultural and rural heritage.\u000d\u000a      These floristically diverse grasslands are unique to the UK and limited to\u000d\u000a      sites between 200 and\u000d\u000a      400 m above sea level.

Although there is no quantitative\u000d\u000a      data it is likely that\u000d\u000a      upland hay meadows have declined considerably in the second half of the\u000d\u000a      20th century mirroring\u000d\u000a      the 97 % decline in lowland hay meadows (Jefferson (2005) Grass and Forage\u000d\u000a      Science, 60, 322-\u000d\u000a      331).

Consequently they are listed as UK Biodiversity Action Plan\u000d\u000a      (BAP) priority habitats (see\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/jncc.defra.gov.uk\/page-5706\u000d\u000a      for more information) and are listed on the European Habitats\u000d\u000a      directive which means that they have the highest conservation priority.\u000d\u000a    The impact of Newcastle research on upland hay meadows\u000d\u000a    Newcastle research \"...has made a huge contribution to our\u000d\u000a        understanding of hay meadow\u000d\u000a        conservation, and underpinned the development of agri-environment\u000d\u000a        measures for their\u000d\u000a        conservation.\" Prior to the research \"management\u000d\u000a        prescriptions...were simplistic and did not allow\u000d\u000a        flexibility to acknowledge different situations and starting conditions.\u000d\u000a        There was limited\u000d\u000a        understanding of the timescales and trajectories of meadow restoration\u000d\u000a        and the mechanisms\u000d\u000a        underpinning restoration.

The scheme,\u000d\u000a      administrated by Natural England, offers payments to farmers, land\u000d\u000a      managers and tenants in\u000d\u000a      England in return for complex environmental management in certain priority\u000d\u000a      areas including the\u000d\u000a      uplands. This scheme requires support and advice from Natural England\u000d\u000a      advisers to develop a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive agreement that achieves a wide range of environmental\u000d\u000a      benefits.\u000d\u000a    Farmers, land owners and tenants can identify hay meadows on their land\u000d\u000a      using the Farm\u000d\u000a      Environment Plan manual (2010; [E7]). This manual has used the\u000d\u000a      Newcastle University research to\u000d\u000a      develop an identification key (key 2b, page 77) which allows farmers to\u000d\u000a      identify which meadows\u000d\u000a      can be included in the Scheme. Natural England advisors then use Technical\u000d\u000a      Information Notes\u000d\u000a      (TINs) to develop strategies for upland grassland management and to set\u000d\u000a      indicators of success\u000d\u000a      used to judge the restoration of species-rich grassland under the Higher\u000d\u000a      Level Stewardship\u000d\u000a      scheme (options HK6, \"maintenance of...\" and HK7 \"restoration of\u000d\u000a      species-rich semi-natural\u000d\u000a      grassland\"). These TINs have been heavily influenced by Newcastle's\u000d\u000a      research. For example, the\u000d\u000a      targets of restoration success identified through the research [P4]\u000d\u000a      have been incorporated in to TIN\u000d\u000a      050 (2009) [E1, E2]. The finding [P5] that yellow rattle\u000d\u000a      directly influences increased plant diversity\u000d\u000a      and indirectly increases nitrogen cycling in upland hay meadows has been\u000d\u000a      incorporated in to TIN\u000d\u000a      060 (2009) [E1, E2].\u000d\u000a    Recently, Newcastle research has contributed to the evidence-base that\u000d\u000a      underpins Natural\u000d\u000a      England's approach to delivery of agri-environment schemes and\u000d\u000a      partnerships with hill-farming\u000d\u000a      communities in relation to nutrient additions and spring grazing and hay\u000d\u000a      cutting regimes [E3].

In the period 2007 to 2013\u000a      &#8364;20.3 billion (&#163;17.6 billion) have been allocated towards agri-environment\u000a      measures, including measures which promote biodiversity such as the NATURA\u000a      2000 measures, [E1]. This represents 48% of global aid spending to\u000a      biodiversity in the same period [E1]. This level of spending on\u000a      environmental and other measures could not have been possible without the\u000a      European wide implementation of modulation which from 2008 to 2013 was\u000a      responsible for approximately &#8364;10.45 billion (&#163;8.84 billion) of additional\u000a      spending on rural development measures [E2]. In England modulation\u000a      helps to fund the Environmental Stewardship scheme, the entry level of\u000a      which is open to all farmers. Modulation supports additional spending on\u000a      similar rural development programmes in the rest of the UK and across an\u000a      additional 14 EU countries. Research carried out on behalf of the EU [E4]\u000a      has recognised that the overall \"impacts of modulation on the\u000a        environment are positive for all environmental parameters\" and that\u000a      \"these positive impacts are the result of the availability of\u000a        additional funds within Pillar 2 and relate to a whole range of measures\u000a        across all four Axes\". However, it is acknowledged that the extent\u000a      of these impacts is \"hard to quantify beyond general terms\" [E4].\u000a    Route to impact\u000a    From 2000, the Rural Development Regulation (Regulation (EC) 1257\/1999)\u000a      gave EU states the option of introducing a process called `modulation'\u000a      into how they spent their CAP budgets. Modulation works by reducing the\u000a      direct payments made to farmers under Pillar 1 of the CAP (used to\u000a      subsidise agricultural production), with some of the savings being\u000a      transferred to Pillar 2 of the CAP where it pays for measures to support\u000a      environmental management and rural development.\u000a    The research on the impacts of modulation produced by Newcastle\u000a      University was promoted through direct interaction with policy makers at a\u000a      UK cabinet level. Ward was seconded to the Prime Minister's\u000a        Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) in the Cabinet Office to\u000a      review rural and agricultural policy and to advise the Prime Minister and\u000a      other key ministers directly on how the government should pursue CAP\u000a      reform in the UK. This advocacy convinced the UK Government to take a lead\u000a      in switching hundreds of millions of pounds from production subsidies to\u000a      environmental payments. This decision had required a U-turn from the then\u000a      Agriculture Minister, who in February 1999, prior to Ward's secondment to\u000a      the PIU, had declared that the UK was `not minded' to introduce modulation\u000a      (House of Commons Agriculture Committee 1999, para.114). The influence of\u000a      Newcastle University research is reflected in the following quotes from\u000a      the then Minister of Agriculture \"I remain grateful for the research\u000a        undertaken by Newcastle University's Centre for Rural Economy on the\u000a        potential impacts on environmental management and rural development of a\u000a        policy of modulation of CAP payments. Newcastle University were pioneers\u000a        of this development in the late 1990's. The research that was undertaken\u000a        by Professor Philip Lowe and Dr Neil Ward helped inform policy within\u000a        the Ministry of Agriculture and later on within Government more\u000a        generally\" [E7]. The adoption of modulation \"... has led\u000a        to a significant restructuring of the CAP. As a reform it is far more\u000a        sustainable than the regime it came to replace. That's quite an\u000a        achievement but I don't think we would have got there without being able\u000a        to back our point up with the evidence and arguments provided by\u000a        Newcastle University's early research.\" [E7]\u000a    The UK's early and voluntary adoption of modulation, based on the\u000a      findings of Newcastle University's research, set a new and more radical\u000a      course for Europe in redirecting the financing of the CAP during\u000a      subsequent reforms, opening much wider opportunities for the CAP to\u000a      support environmental and rural development objectives which would lead to\u000a      substantially increased budgets (releasing additional funds in excess of\u000a      &#8364;10 billion, &#163;8.46 billion) for environmental management and rural\u000a      development through the period between 2005 and 2013. The broader impacts\u000a      of the Newcastle University research is illustrated by the following\u000a      quotes from the then Agriculture Minister and a senior figure in the rural\u000a      policy community \"The Newcastle University research was invaluable in\u000a        informal meetings with other Agricultural Ministers in helping convince\u000a        them that modulation, and indeed the very existence of a second pillar,\u000a        was a viable way forward for the CAP.\" [E7]\u000a    Newcastle's \"...research played a highly influential role in providing\u000a        the evidence and rationale for a major shift in the UK Government's\u000a        position on modulation and subsequently in adoption of mandatory\u000a        modulation by EU member states during reform of the Common Agricultural\u000a        Policy. This was helped by the quality of [Newcastle University's]\u000a        connections in the policy community and the effective dissemination and\u000a        promotion of its research.\" [E8]\u000a    The impact in the period 2008 - 2013\u000a    The CAP Reforms of 2003 (the Mid-Term Review) stipulated that direct\u000a      payments over &#8364;5000 (&#163;4229) to farmers in the EU-15 (the fifteen EU\u000a      members states before the accession of 10 new members in 2004) would be\u000a      decreased by 3%, 4% and 5% respectively from 2005, 2006, 2007, staying at\u000a      5% for the following years. At a 5% rate, modulation across the EU-15 led\u000a      to an annual transfer of about &#8364;1.2 billion (&#163;1.02 billion) (in current\u000a      prices) [E2] from the production subsidies to rural development and\u000a      environmental schemes. From 2010 modulation rates increased progressively\u000a      to 7%, 8%, 9% and 10% for 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. This\u000a      increase led to a net additional transfer from the first pillar to the\u000a      second of &#8364;3.25 billion (&#163;2.75 billion) (2010: &#8364;0.48 billion (&#163;0.41\u000a      billion); 2011: &#8364;0.69 billion (&#163;0.52 billion); 2012: &#8364;0.91 billion (&#163;0.77\u000a      billion); 2013: &#8364;1.2 billion (&#163;1.02 billion) [E2].\u000a    Specific examples of the benefit of increased spending on the environment\u000a      include increased bird densities. A winter survey of seed-eating birds in\u000a      two areas of England by the RSPB during winter 2007-2008 found that wild\u000a      seed mixture crops supported the highest densities of seed-eating birds E3].\u000a      Similarly Baker et al. (2012) [E5] examined how uptake of the\u000a      English Environmental Stewardship scheme links to changes in national\u000a      farmland bird populations from 2002-2010, finding evidence for positive\u000a      effects on biodiversity of nationally implemented agri-environment\u000a      schemes. A review financed by the Commission of European Communities\u000a      (Pol&#225;kov&#225; et al., 2011) [E6] summarised evidence of the impacts on\u000a      biodiversity and habitat creation of spending on agri- environment\u000a      measures under Pillar 2 of CAP up to 2011 and concluded that \"the\u000a      biodiversity status of agricultural habitats subject to agri-environment\u000a      measures is significantly better than would have been the case if the\u000a      policy had not been in place\" (Executive Summary pp xxi).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The UK's decision to introduce voluntary modulation led directly from\u000a      research conducted at Newcastle University between 1993 and 2008 which\u000a      demonstrated conclusively that broadening the scope of Common\u000a        Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies beyond supporting agricultural\u000a      production through `modulation' would greatly benefit the environment and\u000a      rural economies.

Some of these reforms would be embodied in the EU's Agenda 2000\u000a      objectives which explicitly established economic, social, and\u000a      environmental goals within a new reformulated set of objectives for the\u000a      CAP. In particular these reforms introduced a new rural development policy\u000a      as a second pillar of the CAP, helping to integrate environmental concerns\u000a      into agricultural policy while at the same time developing the vitality of\u000a      rural areas. Research from Newcastle University in the late 1990s\u000a      supported the aims of Agenda 2000.\u000a    Research\u000a    Staff at Newcastle University, particularly Professor Philip Lowe\u000a      (Professor of Rural Economy: 1991 to date), Dr Neil Ward (Research\u000a        Associate: 1993 - 1995; Lecturer: 1995 - 1999; Senior Lecturer: 1999 -\u000a        2001; Professor: 2001; Professor &amp; Director: 2004 - 2008) and Dr\u000a        Katherine Falconer (Research Associate and Lecturer: 1997 - 2001)\u000a      undertook research projects [G1, G2 and G3] that\u000a      helped in the development of these environmental and social aspects of CAP\u000a      reform and supported the introduction of modulation (the partial transfer\u000a      of CAP payments from the support of agriculture to the support of other\u000a      rural activities) as a means of transferring a proportion of the EU's\u000a      farming subsidies into funding for the environment and rural development.\u000a    The Newcastle researchers argued that a coordinated agricultural support,\u000a      adjustment and conservation strategy was needed within the CAP, along with\u000a      an end to competition between these components. They concluded that\u000a      modulation was one means by which progress could be made without requiring\u000a      a fundamental break with policy traditions. They concluded that modulation\u000a      had the ability to correct distortions in agricultural strategy, while\u000a      stimulating further, faster, and deeper change in current agricultural\u000a      systems, therefore allowing them to move further towards achieving\u000a      socially beneficial goals. They further suggested that the approach could\u000a      be applied in a gradual, evolutionary manner that redirected agricultural\u000a      policy over the longer term.

The Home Office also carry out regular inspections to ensure\u000a      that all animal research is in accordance with licence conditions, and\u000a      have confirmed that their inspectors `...frequently make use of [the\u000a      Newcastle findings] when evaluating research procedures in rodents that\u000a      require assessment and alleviation of post-surgical pain' [E9] In\u000a      addition, the Inspectors `...frequently recommend research workers to\u000a        refer to [the Newcastle findings] when formulating their post-operative\u000a        care regimens' and `...regularly facilitate direct contact\u000a        between research workers and [the] group at Newcastle whenever\u000a        specialist advice on analgesia is required' [E9]. In the UK,\u000a      this impacts directly on up to 472,000 animals per year that undergo\u000a      procedures under general anaesthetic and so may require analgesics [E9,\u000a      Home Office Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great\u000a      Britain 2012, E8].\u000a    International policy and practice\u000a    In the US National Academy of Sciences Report (Institute of Laboratory\u000a      Animal Resources), reference to the work by the Newcastle group is given\u000a      in conjunction with the statement that `...fundamental to the relief of\u000a      pain in animals is the ability to recognise its clinical signs in specific\u000a      species'. Their 2011 report [E4] informed revisions to Pain and\u000a      Distress in Laboratory Animals guidelines, produced by The Animal Research\u000a      Advisory Committee. These mandatory guidelines, which form part of the\u000a      National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy, now clearly state that\u000a      `Pre-emptive measures should be taken to minimise or prevent the\u000a      development of pain and\/or distress', citing the Newcastle work. NIH funds\u000a      research at over 2,500 institutes and is the largest source of funding for\u000a      medical research in the world. This guidance is also included by the USA\u000a      Department of Agriculture, Animal Welfare Information Centre [E7].\u000a      These policies impact significantly on European research, as USA-European\u000a      collaborations must adopt this guidance. Hence approximately 4 million\u000a      animals per year in the USA would benefit.\u000a    In Canada, oversight of scientific animal use is the responsibility of\u000a      the Canadian Council on Animal Care. They cite the Newcastle work on their\u000a      website (updated 2012, e.g. Keating et al, 2012, and www.ahwla.org.uk),\u000a      stating that analgesic dosing `...should be tailored to the individual\u000a        animal' [E1]. The Australian and New Zealand Council for the\u000a      Care of Animals in Research and Teaching website also includes references\u000a      to the Newcastle findings [E2]. A further 0.6 million animals per\u000a      year would benefit. As mentioned earlier, numerous institutions cite the\u000a      research work in their requirements for analgesic use (eg Univerities of\u000a      Western Ontario, West Virginia, Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Alabama, New\u000a      York School of Medicine)\u000a    UFAW (Universities Federation of Animal Welfare) is internationally\u000a      recognised as having led the way in improving, and promoting high\u000a      standards of, animal welfare, and their Handbook on the Care and\u000a      Management of Laboratory and other Research Animals serves to inform and\u000a      guide practice. Their most recent edition (2010) frequently cites the\u000a      Newcastle research in relation to the assessment of pain and welfare. The\u000a      behaviour-based assessment developed at Newcastle and their researcher\u000a      training system is suggested as an aid for researchers to `...identify\u000a        and score pain more accurately and reliably' [p.86, E3].\u000a    Education and training\u000a    The work at Newcastle has led to a major change in practice across the\u000a      world. These changes relate to which analgesics are given, the dosing of\u000a      these products and the assessment of pain via behaviour observation [e.g.\u000a      E4]. The website AHWLA (Assessing the Health and Welfare of\u000a      Laboratory Animals, www.ahwla.org.uk)\u000a      was set up (with support from the Swiss 3R Research Foundation) to\u000a      `...provide practical guidance in recognising signs of health and good\u000a      welfare and to help users of the site to become better able to identify\u000a      signs of pain, distress and poor welfare in laboratory animals' . Since\u000a      January 2008, the website has had 70,000 unique visitors from 75\u000a      countries, This material, together with instructional video-material\u000a      produced from data collected on the other studies listed above (in mouse\u000a      and rabbit) has been made available to those delivering training to new\u000a      research staff, and is used on numerous training course (e.g. [E5],\u000a      [E10]). The Newcastle work is also cited in the Australian\u000a      government's `Guidelines to promote the wellbeing of animals used for\u000a      scientific purposes', where the film is recommended as an educational\u000a      resource for behaviour-based pain scoring [E6]. The assessment\u000a      methods are taught at workshops at Newcastle (established with funding\u000a      from BBSRC) and elsewhere. The dose recommendations have been incorporated\u000a      into the training notes provided to the majority of UK research workers\u000a      undertaking mandatory Home Office training in surgery and anaesthesia\u000a      (Module 4) and over 3000 copies of the CDs containing this material have\u000a      been distributed since 2008. In addition to the specific impact on pain\u000a      relief for rodents and rabbits, the work has been extrapolated to other\u000a      species, so these activities impact on all animals used in research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Newcastle University research has changed policy and practice relating to\u000a      the provision of pain relief to rodents and rabbits. This has impacted on\u000a      up to 35 million animals worldwide during the REF period. Having\u000a      established the under-use of analgesics in laboratory rodents, Newcastle\u000a      researchers developed objective pain scoring systems. These established\u000a      that analgesics should be administered to rodents and rabbits, and that\u000a      the efficacy of this treatment should be assessed objectively. The\u000a      research resulted in changes to policy statements, institutional policies\u000a      (both academic and industrial) and individual research worker practices in\u000a      the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe and the UK. This has produced clear\u000a      benefits to the welfare of animals used in biomedical research, helps to\u000a      satisfy public concerns that animals used in research should experience\u000a      the minimum pain and distress, and improves scientific outcomes of\u000a      research, since pain is an uncontrolled experimental variable, that can\u000a      adversely affect study results.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    Newcastle University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Newcastle upon Tyne (University of)","InstitutionName":"Newcastle University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007799}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4826850","Name":"West Virginia"},{"GeoNamesId":"4829764","Name":"Alabama"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[P1] Richardson, CA and Flecknell, P.A.

These can result in post-procedural pain and\u000a      suffering. Aside from the important animal welfare issues, pain can\u000a      influence research outcomes. Therefore, the elimination or control of pain\u000a      within animal research represents both good science and good welfare. In\u000a      the 1990s, the use of analgesia in animal research was incorporated into\u000a      UK and EU legislation. However, it was recognised that the guidelines were\u000a      having little impact on the use of analgesics in laboratory animals\u000a      (Flecknell, 1994, Lab Anim, 28[3]:222-31). Indeed, neither the UK nor EU\u000a      legislation included practical recommendations for the assessment and\u000a      alleviation of post-procedural pain in animals.\u000a    Research\u000a    The relative under-use of analgesics following surgical procedures in\u000a      animal research was confirmed by the Newcastle group via informal contact\u000a      with research workers and regulators, by an email survey and a literature\u000a      review [P1]. The use of analgesics to prevent or alleviate pain in\u000a      animals used in research was reported to be minimal in rodents, if given\u000a      at all. Use in larger species was more widespread, but not routine. It was\u000a      determined that a poor ability to recognise pain and the subsequent\u000a      uncertainties surrounding the use of pain relief were the main reasons for\u000a      this [P1]. Crucially, any analgesics used were administered at\u000a      arbitrary doses, with no evidence of efficacy. This was established by the\u000a      Newcastle-run surveys [P1] and a survey of research establishments\u000a      conducted by the RSPCA.\u000a    In 1997, Prof Flecknell and his team at Newcastle began their unique\u000a      research into identifying means of objectively assessing post-procedural\u000a      pain in animals and the intensity of that pain, in order to enable\u000a      efficient pain relief to be given. They analysed the behaviours of rabbits\u000a      and rodents following surgical and non-surgical procedures, and\u000a      distinguished behaviours specific to pain sensation [P2, P3].\u000a      A pain scoring system was developed and used in subsequent studies to\u000a      establish appropriate and effective doses of analgesics. This\u000a      behaviour-based pain scoring system was evaluated against a simple\u000a      subjective approach commonly used in clinical practice and research\u000a      settings and was shown to be significantly more effective in assessing\u000a      pain. The group also showed that an obstacle to recognition of pain using\u000a      this behaviour-based approach was a tendency to attend to the face of the\u000a      animal, rather than other areas where pain-related behaviours were\u000a      expressed [P4]. This obstacle was overcome by developing\u000a      \"cage-side\" pain scoring based on facial expression assessment, in\u000a      collaboration with colleagues in Canada who had initially developed the\u000a      approach in mice for use in the development of novel analgesics [P5,\u000a      P6]. The work of the group has led to the only, validated,\u000a      cage-side pain scoring methods available for these species.\u000a    Researchers\u000a    Professor Paul Flecknell, 1985-95, Academic-related staff, 1995-\u000a      Professor of Laboratory Animal Science; Project Leader; developed the\u000a      behaviour-based assessment and pain scoring systems.\u000a    Dr Matt Leach - Postdoctoral Research worker, 2005-2012., Lecturer in\u000a      Animal Science, 2012-; developed the pain-face scoring systems and\u000a      behaviour-based pain assessments in rabbits.\u000a    Amy Miller -Post-doctoral researcher, 2010- validated the mouse behaviour\u000a      based systems.\u000a    Dr Claire Richardson, 2003, Academic-related staff, 2012- Postdoctoral\u000a      research fellow -carried out the literature reviews.\u000a    JV Roughan (1998 onwards), research associate\/senior research associate,\u000a      staff scientist 2006-\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23903","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The major impact of this research is in animal health and welfare policy\u000d\u000a      and improved welfare of\u000d\u000a      birds subjected to a large-scale cull in the event of a disease outbreak.\u000d\u000a      The method developed by\u000d\u000a      SRUC has been adopted by all relevant government domains.

Birds'\u000d\u000a      welfare could be severely compromised by the culling procedure itself and\u000d\u000a      by ineffective culling\u000d\u000a      (resulting in live birds being found amongst dead birds, days after the\u000d\u000a      event) [3.1].\u000d\u000a    At the time our research was commissioned there was only one technique\u000d\u000a      available to the UK\u000d\u000a      Government for the large-scale emergency culling of poultry; the\u000d\u000a      containerised gassing technique.\u000d\u000a      This method requires live poultry to be caught by hand prior to killing,\u000d\u000a      potentially exposing the\u000d\u000a      catchers to the virus and posing logistical problems associated with\u000d\u000a      capturing many birds.\u000d\u000a    Scottish Government policy makers identified the need for a more\u000d\u000a      effective technique that would\u000d\u000a      not unduly compromise bird welfare and funded the project, which began in\u000d\u000a      2006.\u000d\u000a    In summary:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Before considering how gases could be used to cull poultry it was\u000d\u000a        important to understand\u000d\u000a        how the birds responded to the presence of a wide range of candidate\u000d\u000a        gases. The project\u000d\u000a        team (including Prof. Sparks (Team Leader, employed 1989-onwards) and Dr\u000d\u000a        Sandilands\u000d\u000a        (Behavioural Scientist, employed 2001-onwards)) selected gas mixtures\u000d\u000a        (types and\u000d\u000a        concentrations), and then commissioned innovative apparatus to be built\u000d\u000a        in which birds\u000d\u000a        could be exposed to the gases and their responses quantified. The\u000d\u000a        outputs from these\u000d\u000a        studies were important in enabling gas concentrations or mixtures that\u000d\u000a        were overtly\u000d\u000a        aversive to the birds to be identified and their testing discontinued\u000d\u000a        [3.3].\u000d\u000a      In the second phase, gases that had not been rejected in phase one\u000d\u000a        were used to kill small\u000d\u000a        numbers of birds. The key measurement was the time to unconsciousness\u000d\u000a        and death. The\u000d\u000a        team also studied the behavioural responses of the birds during this\u000d\u000a        period. This phase\u000d\u000a        involved a range of techniques including telemetry studies to monitor\u000d\u000a        brain ECG activity.\u000d\u000a      The gas mixture selected from phase two was then taken out of the\u000d\u000a        laboratory and tested\u000d\u000a        using purpose built test rigs in which the behaviour of the gas within\u000d\u000a        an enclosed space &#8212; designed\u000d\u000a        to represent a poultry building &#8212; could be studied. Following these\u000d\u000a        tests, various\u000d\u000a        methods of getting the gas into an empty building were assessed, as it\u000d\u000a        was vital that the\u000d\u000a        gas was introduced in a manner (time and concentration) consistent with\u000d\u000a        welfare\u000d\u000a        parameters determined previously. This included the testing of a number\u000d\u000a        of injection\u000d\u000a        techniques and ultimately the design of a novel portable injection\u000d\u000a        lance. This design\u000d\u000a        enabled the gas to be inserted into even poorly constructed\/maintained\u000d\u000a        buildings with the\u000d\u000a        minimum of building preparation and protected the birds from the\u000d\u000a        physical forces of the gas\u000d\u000a        plume. The lance was also designed to maximise the protection of human\u000d\u000a        health, minimise\u000d\u000a        the logistics associated with using the equipment, and so reduce the\u000d\u000a        risk of inadvertent\u000d\u000a        transmission of the disease [3.2, 3.4].\u000d\u000a      Ultimately, the process was validated by testing it on a house of live\u000d\u000a        birds, and thereafter,\u000d\u000a        by a number of tests conducted by the UK Government to confirm the\u000d\u000a        suitability of the\u000d\u000a        equipment for use across a wide range of housing types [3.5, 3.6].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23904","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact on Policy\u000a      The research has had a direct and profound impact on European policy.\u000a      Member States are now\u000a      required to ensure that the Axis 2 (Sustainable Land Management) element\u000a      of their 2007-2013\u000a      Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) are targeted at \"...biodiversity and\u000a      preservation of high\u000a      nature value farming and forestry systems, water and climate change\". As\u000a      part of this\u000a      prioritisation, the EU requires that all 28 Member States (and parts\u000a      thereof) need to:\u000a    \u000a      Identify the extent and characteristics of the HNV farming systems\u000a        occurring within their\u000a        Member State\/region [5.1].\u000a      Identify what steps they are taking to support and maintain HNV\u000a        farming, especially through\u000a        Rural Development Programmes (RDPs).\u000a      Monitor changes to the area of land covered by HNV farming systems\u000a        (and the nature values\u000a        associated with HNV farming) as part of their monitoring of RDPs.\u000a    \u000a    The requirement for action at a Member State level meant we advised the\u000a      Scottish Government in\u000a      2009 on how to establish how much HNV farming occurs in Scotland and how\u000a      to track trends in\u000a      such systems [5.1].\u000a    Since 1995, we have made a significant contribution to the dissemination\u000a      of findings from the\u000a      research described above via a range of media (e.g. refereed publications,\u000a      popular articles and\u000a      newsletters, conference proceedings and workshop outputs, technical\u000a      reports, policy briefings) to\u000a      European scientists and policy makers [5.2].

The SRUC research was instrumental in\u000d      underpinning the decision of policy makers in the EU, and subsequently\u000d      administrations in member states, to enshrine in legislation the\u000d      requirement that the ca 200 million laying hens housed annually in\u000d      extensive systems in Europe have access to perches when in the laying\u000d      house.\u000d    SRUC research has been used by member states to justify to producers the\u000d      need to install aerial perches over slatted surfaces. So for example, in\u000d      Scotland the work we have done has enabled Government to be even more\u000d      specific in interpreting relevant EU legislation, with the Government\u000d      requirement being that hens have access to aerial perches (Welfare of\u000d      Farmed Animals (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2002 (SSI 2002 No. 334))\u000d      while continuing to use literature that we have produced in 2007 to guide\u000d      producers as to the requirements and benefits of aerial perches. More\u000d      recently, producers have attempted to argue against the installation of\u000d      perches on the basis that they increase the incidence of bone fractures in\u000d      laying hens. Our work has demonstrated that careful design of perches can\u000d      address welfare issues and increase productivity without increasing bone\u000d      fracture in laying hens.\u000d    Further national impact on policy is demonstrated in the Farm Animal\u000d      Welfare Council's (now Farm Animal Welfare Committee) (FAWC) opinion paper\u000d      on osteoporosis (Dec 2010), which referred to work done by SRUC (on the\u000d      association between bone fracture and housing system), and concluded that\u000d      `the design and layout of perches can be improved to prevent bone\u000d        fracture.

ALUF is responsible for around 7% of UK GHG emissions. These are\u000d\u000a      coming under increasing scrutiny as the UK seeks to meet its commitments\u000d\u000a      on GHG reductions [3.1]. Previous work on mitigation potential in the\u000d\u000a      agricultural sector had not sought to consider relative costs of\u000d\u000a      mitigation measures, and so policymakers had no basis for including the\u000d\u000a      sector in GHG reduction targets.\u000d\u000a    The UK government empowered the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to\u000d\u000a      explore how emission reductions could be shared across UK industry and\u000d\u000a      research at SRUC was commissioned as part of this effort to explore the\u000d\u000a      science and economics of mitigation methods in ALUF. SRUC research [3.2,\u000d\u000a      3.3, 3.4] has improved the government's understanding of how Marginal\u000d\u000a      Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) can be applied to evaluate alternative\u000d\u000a      approaches to mitigating climate change from the ALUF sector. Drawing on\u000d\u000a      economic theory of efficient pollution control, a MACC is a policy support\u000d\u000a      tool that helps identify the most cost-effective ways of reducing\u000d\u000a      pollution. They show how much different measures can reduce emissions by,\u000d\u000a      and how much the reduction will cost society in terms of environmental,\u000d\u000a      financial, and political implications. With this information, government\u000d\u000a      can then determine how much mitigation effort should be sought in a\u000d\u000a      specific sector, and where in that particular sector efforts should be\u000d\u000a      concentrated. A MACC also assesses the potential offered by new\u000d\u000a      technologies, and is therefore useful in guiding research priorities.\u000d\u000a    Beginning in 2008, our researchers (inter-disciplinary work by Prof.\u000d\u000a      Moran (Team Leader, employed 1999-onwards), and Dr. Wall (Researcher,\u000d\u000a      employed 2001-onwards) (drawing on fundamental research in animal [3.4]\u000d\u000a      and crop and soil science) first identified the range of possible\u000d\u000a      mitigation measures (over 100), and studied their technical potential\u000d\u000a      (i.e. how much mitigation each measure could deliver if used in the UK).\u000d\u000a      They then estimated the costs of implementing such measures across a range\u000d\u000a      of farm types and land uses. This process involved a review of\u000d\u000a      experimental evidence and evaluation of papers, addressing uncertainties\u000d\u000a      surrounding nitrous oxide and methane generation and management and\u000d\u000a      behavioural processes [3.5]. After analysing the original measures, a\u000d\u000a      short list of the 31 most effective and practical mitigation measures was\u000d\u000a      subsequently combined in a MACC to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      each measure. Some were shown to increase profitability whilst decreasing\u000d\u000a      emissions (e.g. improved nitrogen application efficiency); whilst others\u000d\u000a      have little environmental impact, and cost the sector money (e.g. improved\u000d\u000a      land drainage).\u000d\u000a    Collaborator: Prof. Smith (Univ. of Aberdeen) worked on land use change\u000d\u000a      aspects of the work.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23907","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The major impact of this research is improved profitability and\u000d\u000a      sustainability of the UK dairy\u000d\u000a      industry. Adoption of these new indexes has improved production, fertility\u000d\u000a      and economic\u000d\u000a      performance of dairy cattle.

The vast majority of dairy cows\u000d\u000a      in the UK are bred\u000d\u000a      using artificial insemination (AI), to bulls which rank highly on &#163;PLI. It\u000d\u000a      is the combination of high\u000d\u000a      AI use, and the selection of high &#163;PLI bulls by AI companies which\u000d\u000a      underpins most of the\u000d\u000a      impact. Additional, smaller gains arise from farmers selecting the best\u000d\u000a      available AI bulls, and\u000d\u000a      breeding replacement heifers from the highest ranking &#163;PLI cows.\u000d\u000a    We have worked to support the dairy industry levy bodies (currently\u000d\u000a      DairyCo) in encouraging\u000d\u000a      widespread uptake by breeding companies and farmers, via many workshop and\u000d\u000a      conference\u000d\u000a      presentations and with articles for websites, the farming press, and other\u000d\u000a      media activity.

This was the first move away from a production-only\u000d\u000a      breeding goal for UK\u000d\u000a      dairy farmers. &#163;PLI was further upgraded in 2003 with the inclusion of\u000d\u000a      health traits (somatic cell\u000d\u000a      counts from milk as an indicator of mastitis\/udder health, and locomotion\u000d\u000a      as an indicator of\u000d\u000a      lameness), and in 2006 with the inclusion of fertility traits; traits that\u000d\u000a      were all identified as\u000d\u000a      important and researched by our group.\u000d\u000a    Genetic evaluation &#8212; the process of predicting the genetic merit of\u000d\u000a      animals from pedigree and\u000d\u000a      performance data (milk yield, growth, disease incidence etc.) and,\u000d\u000a      recently, molecular genetic\u000d\u000a      data &#8212; is a mathematically complex, internationally scarce, but key\u000d\u000a      enabling technology in\u000d\u000a      delivering the impact described.

This\u000d\u000a        was achieved by: (i) comprehensively measuring and comparing the\u000d\u000a        performance of\u000d\u000a        cows selected for high milk solids yield with control line cows in our\u000d\u000a        Langhill experiment &amp;mdsh; the\u000d\u000a        world's longest running dairy cattle selection experiment; and (ii)\u000d\u000a        estimating genetic\u000d\u000a        correlations among traits of interest, from both Langhill [3.2] and UK\u000d\u000a        dairy industry data\u000d\u000a        [3.3]. This work identified that selection for production had a major\u000d\u000a        impact on body\u000d\u000a        condition score change, which in turn, affected reproductive\u000d\u000a        performance. As a result,\u000d\u000a        the UK was the first country in the world to routinely record body\u000d\u000a        condition scores in dairy\u000d\u000a        herds and was the first to use this information in national genetic\u000d\u000a        evaluations for dairy\u000d\u000a        cow fertility.\u000d\u000a      Developing new `breeding goals' &#8212; identifying the most appropriate\u000d\u000a        combination of traits\u000d\u000a        to select for, and their relative economic importance &#8212; and developing\u000d\u000a        genetic\u000d\u000a        improvement tools to allow selection for these breeding goals [3.3, 3.4,\u000d\u000a        3.5].

The SoS\u000a        report has been used as evidence to support further thinking on\u000d\u000a      soils, which has in turn influenced UK policy. The main impacts of SoS are\u000d\u000a      tied in with other drivers such as Scottish Soil Framework, Land Use\u000d\u000a      Strategy and Rural Diffuse Pollution Plan for Scotland.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Stakeholders\u000d\u000a      The VESS chart [5.2] and associated research results were communicated to\u000d\u000a      the agricultural industry mainly through talks to farmers and consultants\u000d\u000a      via the Scottish Agricultural College (now SRUC) and the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Agricultural Organisation Society Monitor Farm schemes, Soil Association\u000d\u000a      Climate Change Programme, England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery\u000d\u000a      Initiative, HGCA- SAC Cereals Open Days and Knowledge Transfer days [5.3],\u000d\u000a      supermarkets, schools, the Farming for a Better Climate Initiative and the\u000d\u000a      Royal Highland Shows.

The VESS chart and training videos are freely available on the SRUC webpage\u000d\u000a      (1500 views of the videos so far) and VESS is promoted by other\u000d\u000a      organisations such as the Soil\u000a        Association, Linking Environment and farming (LEAF)\u000d\u000a      and the Duchy\u000d\u000a        College Rural Business School. Feedback forms (between 7 and 40 per\u000d\u000a      meeting) from farmers' meetings indicate that the research and associated\u000d\u000a      advisory effort is increasing farmers' awareness of the risk of soil\u000d\u000a      structural damage with stated intentions to improve affected soil and\u000d\u000a      increase farm profitability. In overview, major stakeholder engagement\u000d\u000a      activity based upon this research has contributed significantly to raising\u000d\u000a      awareness of the importance of soil quality. It also highlighted the\u000d\u000a      importance of using indicators of quality to guide improvements of soil\u000d\u000a      fertility and to reduce the emission of nitrous oxide, the greenhouse gas\u000d\u000a      dominating equivalent carbon budgets in UK.\u000d\u000a    Economic Impact\u000d\u000a      Reduction of soil structure has an immediate economic impact at farm level\u000d\u000a      because a decrease in soil quality decreases crop yield. A decrease in\u000d\u000a      structural quality as a result of compaction decreases grain yield by,\u000d\u000a      typically, 16% [5.4]. If each of 1000 farms with substandard soil\u000d\u000a      structure was improved by one VESS unit of soil structural quality then\u000d\u000a      wheat yield would increase by 28 tonnes, a potential increase in revenue\u000d\u000a      of &#163;4,500 per farm, &#163;4.5M annually overall (these figures are based on an\u000d\u000a      average sized farm in the UK of 60 hectares with one third of the soil\u000d\u000a      assumed to be in sub-standard physical condition and an average wheat\u000d\u000a      yield of 7 t\/ha. The structural improvement cost is estimated to be\u000d\u000a      &#163;50\/h).\u000d\u000a    International impact\u000d\u000a      The VESS chart [5.2] has been adopted internationally and translated into\u000d\u000a      several languages &#8212; including Spanish (Universidad Polit&#233;cnica de Madrid,\u000d\u000a      Spain), Portuguese (Universidade Estadual de Maring&#225;, Brazil), French\u000d\u000a      (INRA, P&#233;ronne, France) and Danish (Aarhus University, Denmark). The\u000d\u000a      impact has been particularly noticeable in Brazil, where VESS is used as a\u000d\u000a      rapid means of estimating soil quality in areas under no-tillage, and\u000d\u000a      under sugar cane production (9.6 million ha in 2011). In the past three\u000d\u000a      years, 300 agricultural students and 350 agronomists have been taught how\u000d\u000a      to use the method in Paran&#225; and Goias States. In 2009-2012, it was shown\u000d\u000a      to be a useful indicator of soil quality relevant to grain yield in a\u000d\u000a      large international study [5.8].

In 1998, Prof. Watson\u000d\u000a      (Team Leader, employed 1990-onwards) showed that soil structure and\u000d\u000a      biological activity are particularly important in managing productivity\u000d\u000a      within organic crop rotations because crops depend more on soil of good\u000d\u000a      quality when common fertilisers and pesticides are eliminated [3.2]. Soil\u000d\u000a      quality or soil fertility is measured by indicators of physical, chemical\u000d\u000a      and biological activity. Soil underpins the hugely important agri-food\u000d\u000a      supply chain that contributes &#163;96 billion to the UK economy. The Foresight\u000d\u000a      Projection on Global Food and Farming Futures emphasised the importance of\u000d\u000a      improving soil structure and organic matter levels to achieve successful\u000d\u000a      integrated soil management.\u000d\u000a    Research on organic farming in 2000-2002 by Ball in North-East Scotland\u000d\u000a      produced a simple test to assess soil structural quality [3.3]. The test,\u000d\u000a      comprising three visual scoring keys, proved useful in quantifying\u000d\u000a      properties of the soil surface, structure and rooting conditions that\u000d\u000a      related to differences in fertility between the cropping phases within\u000d\u000a      rotations. In 2004-7, the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) was\u000d\u000a      refined in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Aberdeen\u000d\u000a      and the University of Aarhus, Denmark. The VESS is a simple test in which\u000d\u000a      the aggregation, porosity and root growth of a spadeful of soil are\u000d\u000a      integrated into a single score &#8212; a structural indicator [3.4]. The\u000d\u000a      indicator is assessed from a key containing photographs and traffic-light\u000d\u000a      grading of quality on a laminated field chart that allows users to score\u000d\u000a      their soil quickly.\u000d\u000a    VESS was used to measure physical condition and crop growth under\u000d\u000a      different tillage systems in Denmark and differences in fertility within\u000d\u000a      Scottish organic rotations [3.4]. In a trial on establishment of organic\u000d\u000a      cereals, VESS showed that the soil was of good quality but was also\u000d\u000a      susceptible to compaction damage that reduced grain yield [3.5]. Research\u000d\u000a      with Lincoln University in New Zealand demonstrated the value of VESS for\u000d\u000a      assessing structure and porosity in different topsoil layers under dairy\u000d\u000a      pasture, particularly near the surface where the powerful greenhouse gas\u000d\u000a      nitrous oxide is produced [3.6] or in stony soils where the use of\u000d\u000a      destructive sampling techniques are not possible.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23909","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The immediate impact of the research was the acknowledgment by Pfizer\u000a      Animal Health (now Zoetis) of the connection of BNP to the use of the\u000a      PregSure BVD vaccine in the dam, which led to the withdrawal of the\u000a          vaccine from sale in Europe and elsewhere in the world (5.1).\u000a      Despite the vaccine being withdrawn, cases of bleeding calf syndrome\u000a      continue to be found in some calves born to dams that have been\u000a      historically vaccinated.

Similar conclusions have been drawn by European Food\u000d\u000a      Safety Authority and published on 15 July 2008 (updated in 2012) [5.4].\u000d\u000a      There is already some use of cloned livestock in Europe, for example\u000d\u000a      several hundreds of cattle that are progeny of cloned ancestors live in\u000d\u000a      Switzerland [5.5], but animal cloning for food production in Europe meets\u000d\u000a      with considerable opposition. Use of cloned animals is more widespread in\u000d\u000a      Asia and America, where people are more accepting of consuming cloned\u000d\u000a      animal products [5.6].\u000d\u000a    Preserving diversity of livestock\u000d\u000a    The use of cloning from frozen somatic tissue is a much more\u000d\u000a      cost-effective strategy for bio-banking of endangered breeds than the\u000d\u000a      storage of sperm or egg cells. Sample collection and storage is easier and\u000d\u000a      cheaper, the technique can be deployed quickly in emergency situations\u000d\u000a      such as a disease outbreak, and cloning recovers all the genetic variation\u000d\u000a      of the donor &#8212; not just half of it as when using sperm. Consequently, SCNT\u000d\u000a      cloning of farm animals is a common new service in some countries\u000d\u000a      including the USA, Argentina and Brazil [5.7], and it is covered by all\u000d\u000a      major veterinary genetics and animal biotechnology textbooks [5.8, 5.9].\u000d\u000a    Cloning has been used to conserve several animal breeds in the recent\u000d\u000a      past. For example in 2012 an increasingly rare Himalayan pashmina goat\u000d\u000a      breed was successfully cloned. This important achievement, which was\u000d\u000a      performed in the frame of the National Agricultural Innovation Project\u000d\u000a      (NAIP) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, offers hope to the\u000d\u000a      people of Kashmir of increasing production of pashmina; a type of cashmere\u000d\u000a      wool. In Kashmir more than 10 million people are associated with $85\u000d\u000a      million shawl industry that depends on the availability of the\u000d\u000a      exceptionally fine wool produced by the rare animal [5.10].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Impact: Economics.

This in turn depends on the\u000d\u000a      underlying genetics of farm animals. For a long time, Ian Wilmut (employed\u000d\u000a      by Roslin Institute (Group Leader) and UoE (Inaugural Director of MRC\u000d\u000a      Centre for Regeneration and Professor) 1974-2011) and colleagues worked on\u000d\u000a      new methods to create genetically improved livestock by manipulation of\u000d\u000a      stem cells using nuclear transfer.\u000d\u000a    Research published in 1994 from the Roslin Institute (now part of the\u000d\u000a      University of Edinburgh), established that development of embryos\u000d\u000a      reconstructed by nuclear transfer is related to interactions between the\u000d\u000a      donor nucleus and the recipient cytoplasm at the time of fusion and during\u000d\u000a      the first cell cycle following reconstruction [3.1]. This observation led\u000d\u000a      to two protocols the team then followed for maintenance of normal ploidy,\u000d\u000a      using enucleated oocytes at metaphase II (MII) stage of cell division as\u000d\u000a      recipient cytoplasms (cytoplasts). The first was based on the transfer of\u000d\u000a      nuclei in G1, S or G2 phase of the cell cycle into MII cytoplasts devoid\u000d\u000a      of the so-called maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity. The second\u000d\u000a      protocol used nuclei in G1 phase of the cell cycle and MII cytoplasts\u000d\u000a      containing high activity of MPF. A study in mice showed that it was\u000d\u000a      possible to use microtubule inhibitors such as nocodazole to hold cells in\u000d\u000a      mitosis before releasing them and using them as nuclear donors as they\u000d\u000a      were expected to be passing through G1 phase [3.2, 3.3].\u000d\u000a    The practical value of the second protocol was confirmed by the set of\u000d\u000a      experiments published in 1996 in which cells from sheep late blastocysts\u000d\u000a      were either taken at any stage of the cell cycle or were synchronised in\u000d\u000a      G0\/G1 by serum starvation (as alternative to nocodazole). Whereas no lambs\u000d\u000a      were obtained without synchronisation, four live lambs were obtained\u000d\u000a      following transfer from late-passage cells at G0\/G1 [3.4].

Based on the data from this research\u000a      [5.1], the Government developed a new badger culling policy based on\u000a      extensive culling of badgers in areas with a high incidence of bovine TB,\u000a      which is now being implemented. This was developed in partnership with the\u000a      farming community, which will bear most of the cost. Details of the\u000a      implementation of the badger culling are available on the Defra web site\u000a      [5.2].\u000a    While the research has allowed the design of culling policies that are\u000a      predicted to have a beneficial effect on the bovine TB problem if properly\u000a      implemented, it has also highlighted the shortcoming of this approach as a\u000a      stand-alone option. Indeed, the evidence of the extent of culling that is\u000a      required to produce any substantial impact has hardened opposition to\u000a      culling by numerous community groups. An example is a recent decision to\u000a      ban badger culling on Council land [5.3]. Equally, the research has had a\u000a      major impact on public debate around badger culling [5.4-5.6]\u000a    The research and the intense public debate have subsequently influenced\u000a      the UK government to redirect resources to alternative control measures.\u000a      These include development of badger TB vaccination, which has received\u000a      increased funding from Defra over the last 5-10 years, with plans in place\u000a      to develop a bait-delivered vaccine that could be applied to large\u000a      populations of badgers [5.7].\u000a    A second approach is based on the recent demonstration that resistance to\u000a      TB in cattle is a heritable trait (5.8).

Despite these measures and continued intensive\u000a      application of cattle herd testing for TB, the number of cattle herds\u000a      infected with M. bovis has increased progressively over the last\u000a      25 years.\u000a    In 1997, the Krebs review [3.1] recommended that Defra conduct a badger\u000a      culling trial to establish the contribution that badgers make to bovine\u000a      tuberculosis and to determine the impact of different culling strategies\u000a      on the incidence of TB in cattle. This led, in 1998, to the initiation of\u000a      a National Badger Culling Trial and a series of associated research\u000a      projects, to test the effects of different culling protocols on the\u000a      incidence of cattle TB and on the transmission dynamics of infection in\u000a      culled areas. The trial was initiated in 1998 and completed in 2006.\u000a    An Independent Scientific Group headed by Professor Morrison (Professor\u000a      of Immunology and Group Leader, UoE employed 2002-onwards) oversaw the\u000a      design and implementation of the trial and the analysis and interpretation\u000a      of the results, which were published in a number of refereed publications\u000a      [3.2-3.6] and in a final report (2007 [5.1]).

Premiums for grain of a quality suitable for malting can be valued\u000a      at an additional &#163;5\/tonne. Prior to 1998 RLS was not a significant disease\u000a      problem in the UK but now it is regarded as the second most destructive\u000a      foliar pathogen in the North and West of the UK. With a sudden, rapid\u000a      increase in the incidence of the disease in the country's barley crops,\u000a      especially in Scotland, there was an urgent need for information on the\u000a      disease and how to control it. The first HGCA-funded research quickly\u000a      provided growers with the first fungicide programmes aimed at controlling\u000a      RLS in barley crops, saving the industry an estimated &#163;5.4 million per\u000a      annum from 2001 onwards.\u000a    Impact on Disease Control\u000a      The development of the first PCR diagnostic allowed the fungus to be\u000a      detected in leaves two to four weeks before symptoms appeared. This\u000a      enabled growers to target fungicide application, providing protection to\u000a      crops that had not yet developed visible disease symptoms. In Scotland the\u000a      area protected from Ramularia by an effective fungicide rose from 4,000 ha\u000a      to over 160,000 ha in just two years and more than trebled in the entire\u000a      UK to just over 350,000 ha. Identification of seed as a major inoculum\u000a      source enabled seed health schemes and treatments to be developed, aimed\u000a      at reducing or eliminating Rcc in barley seed stocks.\u000a    Impact on the Agricultural Industry\u000a      The increasing importance of RLS in spring and winter barley led to its\u000a      inclusion in the list of pathogens examined in HGCA-funded research into\u000a      Appropriate Fungicide Doses (2001-onwards). As a result, RLS is now\u000a      considered to be a major pathogen by the Chemical Regulation Directorate\u000a      and agrochemical companies must now screen for activity in new chemicals\u000a      used against the pathogen. Ongoing developments will have an impact on\u000a      reducing the current &#163;57 million annual yield loss in UK barley\u000a      production.\u000a    Subsequent HGCA-funded work allowed determination of resistance ratings\u000a      for Ramularia leaf spot in commercial UK barley varieties. Official\u000a      resistance ratings for Ramularia in spring barley varieties were published\u000a      for the first time in 2013. This is a significant step, as this\u000a      information, along with all project summaries, is sent out to 26,000\u000a      barley growers in the UK (over 3,000 of them in Scotland) and is used when\u000a      selecting the most appropriate varieties to grow. This reduces reliance on\u000a      pesticides and has environmental as well as economic benefits.\u000a    A forecasting scheme, based on leaf wetness at a key period in early crop\u000a      development was developed in 2010. The risk scheme allows farmers to\u000a      adjust fungicide programmes if they are located in a low or high-risk\u000a      region. The scheme has been publicised for 3 growing seasons via our Crop\u000a      Protection Report (http:\/\/www.sruc.ac.uk\/info\/120118\/crop_clinic\/500\/crop_protection_report)\u000a      which received over 2,000 web page hits a month at the relevant publishing\u000a      dates, and through 600 Crop Protection Report subscriptions.\u000a    Providing practical information to the industry (farming, malting and\u000a      brewing, seed and agrochemical) has been an integral part of research\u000a      undertaken in the past 14 years. Our research findings are disseminated in\u000a      a number of ways; via press releases and articles, the SRUC website, SRUC\u000a      Crop Protection Reports and Advisory Newsletters, Open Days (approx. 250\u000a      attendees at each) and winter disease roadshows (approx. 200 attendees at\u000a      each) and farmer meetings (approx. 150 attendees at each). Feedback from\u000a      Open Days indicates that 95 to 100% of respondents are happy with the\u000a      findings presented and are confident it can make a positive impact on\u000a      their production systems. New scientific information has been disseminated\u000a      through peer reviewed papers and European and international scientific\u000a      conferences and workshops. We have promoted the research at two European\u000a      workshops organised specifically on RLS.\u000a    At the outset of this research, losses due to RLS in Scotland were\u000a      calculated to be &#163;13M on an annual basis. Our research led to targeted and\u000a      effective fungicide programmes for growers offering major reductions in\u000a      yield losses due to RLS. By 2012, 98% of Scottish barley crops received\u000a      fungicides with the major products used highly active against RLS.

Although a similar problem had affected crops in\u000a      Germany and Ireland the previous year, there was little information on the\u000a      cause, the economic importance, or on methods to manage the problem. As\u000a      barley is the main cereal crop grown in Scotland, and the most valuable,\u000a      it was vital this new disease threat was managed.\u000a    \u000a      We began researching the disease in 1998 (the team included Drs. Oxley\u000a        (Senior Researcher, employed 1985-onwards), Havis (Researcher, employed\u000a        1996-onwards), Hughes (Researcher, employed 2003-2008), Fountaine (Plant\u000a        Microbial Ecologist, employed 2007-onwards), and Burnett (Team Leader,\u000a        employed 1992-onwards) identified the pathogen and produced a field test\u000a        for early identification of infestation), and initial work was funded by\u000a        the Home-Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA). This first project led to the\u000a        discovery that Ramularia collo-cygni (Rcc) was the main biotic\u000a        factor involved in leaf spotting in barley, causing a disease now called\u000a        Ramularia Leaf Spotting (RLS) [3.1].\u000a      A subsequent three-year HGCA-funded project focused on the effect of\u000a        oxidative stress on the barley crop and the most effective chemical\u000a        control for RLS. It developed the first fungicide programmes aimed at\u000a        controlling RLS in barley crops.\u000a      This initial research was followed by a three-year project, funded by\u000a        the Scottish Government (SG; 2000-3), which aimed to design a test that\u000a        would detect the fungus before symptoms appeared on the plant.\u000a      The first diagnostic for the pathogen [3.2] was developed by the\u000a        research team and this nested PCR test was able to detect the fungus at\u000a        a molecular level. Field experiments showed that the test enabled the\u000a        detection of the fungus in the leaves two to four weeks before the crop\u000a        appeared to be affected. These findings demonstrated the importance of\u000a        applying fungicides to protect crops that had no visible disease\u000a        symptoms.\u000a      Subsequent SG funded work (2005-2011) indicated that seed-borne\u000a        infection is the most important source of Rcc infection in crops. A new\u000a        PCR test developed and validated in our laboratories [3.3] indicated\u000a        widespread contamination of seed stocks throughout the UK.\u000a      The fungus was found to be situated deep within seed tissue and\u000a        therefore not easily controlled by commercial seed treatments. Current\u000a        research projects are examining options for eliminating or reducing\u000a        pathogen inoculum in barley seed. Joint studies with the James Hutton\u000a        Institute, which involved genetic transformation of the fungus with\u000a        fluorescent tags [3.4], greatly aided study of the movement and\u000a        localisation of the pathogen in the plant.\u000a      A joint PhD with John Innes Centre led to establishment of a reliable\u000a        method for inoculating plants with Rcc enabling experimental infection\u000a        studies. The same study showed that the appearance of Rcc was not\u000a        related to the introduction of lines resistant to the pathogen Blumeria\u000a          graminis f.sp. hordei [3.5]. This allowed breeders\u000a        to continue to use this genetic material in crossing studies aimed at\u000a        identifying resistance to RLS.\u000a      Since 2007, joint research with HGCA has been directed towards control\u000a        of RLS through varietal resistance, seed health and forecasting.\u000a      Our research showed that although most spore dispersal coincided with\u000a        leaf wetness late in the growing season, epidemic severity was strongly\u000a        correlated with sustained periods of leaf wetness earlier in the\u000a        development of the crop. This important discovery was used to produce a\u000a        risk forecast.\u000a      Testing of archive barley samples from Rothamsted Research revealed\u000a        that Rcc in barley crops in England increased greatly after 1998, while\u000a        resistance to a major group of fungicides, the strobilurins, could be\u000a        detected from 2001 onwards (3.5).\u000a      The rapid appearance of resistance to this group of fungicides in Rcc\u000a        has led to new work in the area. Thus, two PhD students, funded by\u000a        agrochemical companies, are now examining the development of resistance\u000a        to fungicides and the method of reproduction of the fungus.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23915","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The impact of this research is on health and welfare of rabbits and\u000d      policy with regards advice given to pet owners.

These strategies were implemented with the twin aims of\u000a      controlling classical scrapie, and protecting the consumer from the\u000a      exposure to BSE via sheep meat, should the national flock have become\u000a      infected. The genotyping components of these programmes imposed breeding\u000a      strategies upon entire sheep industries, such that breeding flocks were\u000a      required to select against susceptible PRNP alleles (i.e. VRQ) in\u000a      favour of resistant alleles (e.g. ARR) [5.2].\u000a    The National Scrapie Plan, funded by the UK government, provided free\u000a      genotyping of 1.8 million sheep in 11,000 flocks in an effort to control\u000a      all TSEs, including BSE, in sheep. As a result of EU policy, sheep\u000a      breeders both within and outside the EU require (Directive 91\/68\/EEC)\u000a      [5.3] genotyping and health certificates in order to trade their sheep\u000a      (OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, 2008) [5.4]. Scrapie continues to be\u000a      a notifiable disease in the EU, trade in affected animals or animals\u000a      coming from a flock known to have the disease in the last two years is\u000a      prohibited, and genotyping for resistance remains the best means for\u000a      disease control.\u000a    Selection for TSE resistance by PRNP genotyping has reduced the\u000a      reported incidence of scrapie in sheep as a result of profound impact on\u000a      the genetic structure of the entire UK sheep industry: between 2002 and\u000a      2006 the frequency of the susceptible VRQ allele decreased in ram lambs by\u000a      60% and the frequency of the ARR allele rose by 37% and as a direct\u000a      result, the reported prevalence of sheep with scrapie has also decreased\u000a      from 0.22% in 2003 to 0.04% in 2008 [5.5]. Voluntary PRNP\u000a      genotyping continues, through the industry-funded Scrapie Monitoring\u000a      Scheme (since January 2009), which issues certificates of sheep genotype\u000a      for trading purposes.\u000a    Impact on the Economy\u000a    UK sheep meat exports are worth &gt;&#163;380million (2011 figures) [5.5].\u000a      Breeding for resistance to scrapie and BSE, and the fact that it was being\u000a      carried out, undoubtedly protected the sheep industry from similar damage\u000a      to that inflicted by BSE on cattle and the UK economy. WHO estimates US$6\u000a      billion losses to the UK and in addition, EU paid out 4.7 billion euros in\u000a      control measures for cattle BSE.\u000a    In June 2013, the USDA followed the example of UK and the EU and\u000a      implemented a Scrapie Free Flock Certification Program [5.6].\u000a    Impact on Animal Welfare\u000a    Sheep welfare has been improved by selection against PRNP\u000a      genotypes linked to susceptibility to scrapie and subsequent reduction in\u000a      incidence of disease.

It is a disease of considerable economic consequence to the small\u000a      ruminant farming industry. Within the EU, scrapie is a notifiable disease\u000a      named in Annex B group II; affected farms will face severe trading\u000a      restrictions and may lose a significant number of animals. Scrapie is also\u000a      a listed disease in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2008) and as\u000a      such affects wider international trade.\u000a    Following the bovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)\u000a      epidemic, concerns arose that a zoonotic BSE epidemic in sheep or goats\u000a      could be misdiagnosed for scrapie, this was indeed later shown to have\u000a      happened in a UK goat in the 1990s. Consequently, at the EU level, scrapie\u000a      control became a priority in both species.\u000a    Selection of sheep for scrapie resistance became a possibility after the\u000a      pioneering work by Hunter (Group Leader, Roslin Institute and UoE,\u000a      employed 1986-onwards) demonstrated strong association between prion\u000a      protein (PrP) genotype (PRNP) and scrapie susceptibility (research\u000a      from 1993 onwards). Considerable additional work with Goldmann (Group\u000a      Leader, Roslin Institute and UoE employed 1989-onwards) extended the\u000a      linkage information [3.1-3.3]. Epidemiological studies consolidated this\u000a      association for natural scrapie outbreaks [3.4].\u000a    Hunter\/Goldmann demonstrated that sheep with PRNP genotype\u000a      VRQ\/VRQ are highly susceptible to classical scrapie, whereas ARR\/ARR\u000a      animals are resistant [3.1-3.3].\u000a    Based on the success in the reduction of sheep scrapie following the\u000a      implementation of the various sheep breeding strategies [3.5], EU and UK\u000a      research effort in ruminant TSEs since 2006 has focused on goat scrapie\u000a      genetics. This has led recently to the discovery of new resistant goat PRNP\u000a      alleles (e.g. IRK), which are currently tested in collaboration with the\u000a      goat industry for their potential in breeding programs on commercial\u000a      farms.

Nine\u000d\u000a      districts currently account for 80% of all reported Rhodesian sleeping\u000d\u000a      sickness cases in Uganda.\u000d\u000a    Uganda is unique in having both disease forms that were historically\u000d\u000a      widely separated. In 1999, the focus of the acute form began moving\u000d\u000a      towards the chronic disease focus threatening established, distinct\u000d\u000a      control measures. With &gt; &#163;10 million grants from DfID, Wellcome Trust,\u000d\u000a      and The European Commission Seventh Framework Programme, Prof Welburn\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Medical and Veterinary Molecular Epidemiology, University of\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh, employed 1999-present) provided the evidence base for a\u000d\u000a      new approach to control sleeping sickness in Uganda and established a\u000d\u000a      public-private partnership (PPP) (Stamp Out Sleeping Sickness.

A key collaborator has been The School of\u000d\u000a      Veterinary Medicine and Animal Resources, Makerere University, Kampala,\u000d\u000a      Uganda. Makerere veterinary school has been intimately involved in our\u000d\u000a      research on zoonotic disease for more than 20 years contributing\u000d\u000a      logistical and intellectual inputs.\u000d\u000a    Key underpinning research outputs:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aEvidence that domestic cattle were the principal reservoir of human\u000d\u000a          infective Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense in\u000d\u000a          Uganda (References 3.1-3.2)\u000d\u000a        For 100 years it was impossible to assess the risk posed by livestock\u000d\u000a        carrying both non-human-infective T. b. brucei and T. b.\u000d\u000a          rhodesiense that were indistinguishable. In 1999, we identified\u000d\u000a        and validated a robust molecular marker (sra) for human\u000d\u000a        infectivity in trypanosomes and UoE work revealed that up to 40% of\u000d\u000a        cattle in SE Uganda carried T. b. rhodesiense.\u000d\u000a      \u000aEvidence to support a new approach to sleeping sickness control, by\u000d\u000a          targeting the animal reservoir (References 3.1-3.3)\u000d\u000a        In 2001 our studies showed that outbreaks of sleeping sickness were\u000d\u000a        caused by importation of cattle from endemic areas. Using mathematical\u000d\u000a        modelling, we predicted that treating &gt;86% of cattle would control\u000d\u000a        the spread of disease. We tested the model in Uganda by (i) mass\u000d\u000a        chemoprophylaxis of cattle to remove the parasites from the reservoir\u000d\u000a        hosts and (ii) application of insecticide to cattle to prevent\u000d\u000a        reinfection by tsetse. We showed that a single round of treatment could\u000d\u000a        eliminate human trypanosomes in the cattle reservoir and that a monthly\u000d\u000a        application of insecticide to cattle prevented reinfection.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23918","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Public Policy and Awareness\u000d\u000a      Public policy and awareness represents the major realised impact of the\u000d\u000a      research to date, and the\u000d\u000a      primary focus of this case.

BVD\u000d        infection, frequently occult in effect, weakens calf immune systems and\u000d        so massively potentiates inter- current disease such as calf enteritis\u000d        and pneumonia outbreaks. In the mid-1990s this was poorly understood by\u000d        both farmers and their veterinary advisors. Consequently, our team made\u000d        BVD a priority and evolved an integrated approach to dealing with this\u000d        endemic disease complex.\u000d      Stakeholders, including policy teams, helped prioritise increasingly\u000d        complicated and competing control options for BVD \/ enteritis and\u000d        pneumonia. We concurrently designed the regional EC- funded cattle\u000d        health scheme (HI Health) and consulted with stakeholders to derive\u000d        realistic farm-level cost benefits of BVD prevention.

However, the animal health\u000d        and welfare arguments, combined with cost benefit analyses, did not\u000d        convince the majority of farmers and their veterinary advisors. We\u000d        responded by researching and publishing findings on the reasons behind\u000d        prevailing farmers' attitudes and identifying viable avenues for\u000d        progression.\u000d      Mathematical modelling approaches for BVD control were developed in\u000d        combination with economic approaches [3.2] and numerous information gaps\u000d        (such as farm level biosecurity priorities, serological test\u000d        interpretation and attitudinal surveys) were identified and investigated\u000d        through our research, which extended to international level.

In addition, there is voluntary\u000d\u000a      industry uptake of loose-farrowing alternatives (e.g. UK, Denmark, and\u000d\u000a      Australia).\u000d\u000a    SRUC research on stress physiology of the farrowing sow has been used by\u000d\u000a      European veterinary committees and working groups as a basis for\u000d\u000a      recommendations for legislation which affects how all farmers in the EU\u000d\u000a      raise, house, and manage their livestock\/pigs as well as in developing\u000d\u000a      guidelines for the keeping of pigs (e.g. Defra Welfare Codes, RSPCA\u000d\u000a      welfare standards for pigs). Although there is no full EU ban on crates,\u000d\u000a      the EU council directive 2008\/120\/EC says \"...sows and gilts must be given\u000d\u000a      suitable nesting material in sufficient quantity unless it is not\u000d\u000a      technically feasible for the slurry system used in the establishment...\"\u000d\u000a      This recognition that nest-building is an intrinsic need stems from the\u000d\u000a      scientific evidence reported and cited (SVC, 1997).

Our\u000d\u000a      scientific evidence showing the unequivocal welfare detriments to sows\u000d\u000a      housed in farrowing crates and not permitted substrate for nest-building\u000d\u000a      is used repeatedly to support such decisions.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Piglet Mortality\u000d\u000a    The issue of piglet mortality continues to be a major welfare and\u000d\u000a      economic concern in all farrowing systems. Total pre-weaning mortality in\u000d\u000a      commercial piggeries ranges from 16-20% (cf. BPEX Pig Yearbook 2012),\u000d\u000a      equating to approximately 2 million piglet deaths per annum in the UK\u000d\u000a      alone. With every 0.5% increase in pre-weaning mortality, output is\u000d\u000a      reduced by 10kg\/sow\/year, a significant loss of income to producers and a\u000d\u000a      significant inefficiency within the supply chain. In order to reduce\u000d\u000a      piglet mortality and ensure no rise in piglet mortality in loose farrowing\u000d\u000a      systems, it was vital to identify the causes of death in different\u000d\u000a      farrowing systems and thus identify what contributes to piglet survival\u000d\u000a      [see reference 3.5 above]. A concern that piglet mortality is increased in\u000d\u000a      loose farrowing systems slows progress in abolishing the farrowing crate.\u000d\u000a      However, SRUC investigations into causes of piglet mortality and the\u000d\u000a      genetics of piglet survival, within loose farrowing systems have led to a\u000d\u000a      readily available breeding strategy to actually improve piglet survival.\u000d\u000a      When applied nationally, this approach reduces piglet mortality rates by\u000d\u000a      3% equating to 60,000 fewer piglet deaths, saving the industry &#163;2.7\u000d\u000a        million annually. This work was conducted with breeding companies\u000d\u000a      and farmers and therefore translated directly to industry by incorporating\u000d\u000a      into breeding programmes.\u000d\u000a    This work has been distributed via the EU Welfare Quality programme\u000d\u000a      factsheets (available in 5 different languages), as well as disseminated\u000d\u000a      at invited presentations on improving piglet survival which include: 25\u000d\u000a      pig discussion groups, 2 industry workshops, 3 international conferences\u000d\u000a      and many on-farm consultations.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Impact: Policy, Animal Health and Welfare: Improved sow and piglet\u000d\u000a      welfare and recommendations and codes of practice for farrowing and\u000d\u000a      lactation systems that better meet sow and piglet needs.\u000d\u000a    Significance: Farrowing crates restrict sow movements interfering\u000d\u000a      with natural sow behaviour and increasing psychological distress.

The sow, during the pre-farrowing period, is highly motivated to\u000d\u000a      build a nest in preparation for birth. The restrictive nature of the\u000d\u000a      farrowing crate and its fully slatted flooring constrains this behaviour\u000d\u000a      by preventing provision of space and substrate. It persists as the\u000d\u000a      predominant housing type because it provides protection for the piglets\u000d\u000a      from crushing, which was the main reason it was introduced in the 1960s.\u000d\u000a      However, SRUC research (Drs Baxter (Researcher, employed 2002-onwards),\u000d\u000a      Jarvis (Behavioural Scientist, employed 1997-onwards), Profs.

By comparing\u000d\u000a      animals housed in traditional farrowing crates with those housed loose in\u000d\u000a      pens we confirmed our hypothesis showing that although parturition in\u000d\u000a      itself triggered an increase in cortisol, the plasma levels were\u000d\u000a      considerably higher in crated sows compared to loose sows, demonstrating a\u000d\u000a      physiological stress effect of crating supporting the behavioural evidence\u000d\u000a      [3.3].\u000d\u000a    Our research also questioned the piglet protective nature of the crate by\u000d\u000a      demonstrating that thwarting nest-building behaviour and disrupting\u000d\u000a      hormonal patterns that should prepare the sow for farrowing results in\u000d\u000a      increased negative maternal behaviours such as piglet-directed attacks by\u000d\u000a      the sow (savaging; [3.4]).\u000d\u000a    The next stage was to demonstrate that piglet survival could actually be\u000d\u000a      improved in loose-farrowing systems [3.5, 3.6]. Importantly, we conducted\u000d\u000a      detailed investigations to identify the key behavioural and physiological\u000d\u000a      attributes that underpin piglet viability and survival in a range of\u000d\u000a      farrowing systems, including outdoor loose-housed [3.5].

Optimal contribution theory\u000d\u000a        (described above), provided the theoretical basis to balance genetic\u000d\u000a        selection and conservation of genetic resources (including avoidance of\u000d\u000a        inbreeding) and has been adopted by breeding companies [5.1].\u000d\u000a      Applications of genomic selection currently have the greatest quantifiable\u000d\u000a      impact in the dairy cattle breeding, poultry and pig breeding industries.\u000d\u000a    Impacting dairy cattle\u000d\u000a      Dairy cattle breeding is a multi-million dollar international industry and\u000d\u000a      genomic selection has been implemented in large national breeding\u000d\u000a      programmes since 2008 (initially in the US, Canada, Australia, New\u000d\u000a      Zealand, Ireland and The Netherlands). It now has been extended to nearly\u000d\u000a      all major breeding programmes, including the UK (led by SRUC) in 2012.\u000d\u000a      When implemented in dairy cattle breeding, compared to traditional progeny\u000d\u000a      testing, genomic selection double rates of genetic progress whilst, at the\u000d\u000a      same time, reducing costs of the breeding programmes [5.2].\u000d\u000a      Currently, virtually all bull semen commercially available to dairy\u000d\u000a      farmers comes from bulls evaluated using genomic selection\/prediction\u000d\u000a      techniques. However, cows born from genomically-selected bulls have\u000d\u000a      probably been milking for only 2 years in the REF impact window, in\u000d\u000a      countries that were earliest to adopt. Genetic trends for the dairy\u000d\u000a      populations in the US and Canada were analysed recently [5.3]. Attributing\u000d\u000a      only half of the recent additional genetic gains from the use of young\u000d\u000a      bulls to genomic selection &#8212; which is likely to be conservative &#8212; suggests\u000d\u000a      that genomic selection has contributed at least &#163;200M to these dairy\u000d\u000a      industries in the last 2 years. This will rise rapidly as more of the\u000d\u000a      population descends from genomically-selected parents.\u000d\u000a    Impacting poultry\u000d\u000a      Poultry breeding achieves benefit through the extremely rapid\u000d\u000a      multiplication of stock. At Aviagen (an Edinburgh-based poultry breeding\u000d\u000a      company) a single male bird in the breeding nucleus today can be the\u000d\u000a      great-great-grandparent of ~50 million birds in 4 years' time, producing\u000d\u000a      ca. 76,000,000 kg of meat. Thus, small improvements in the precision with\u000d\u000a      which superior birds are identified and utilised in the breeding nucleus\u000d\u000a      scales up to huge benefits at the consumer level, after only four years\u000d\u000a      [5.2]. Conservatively, we may expect a genetic improvement in productivity\u000d\u000a      due to selective breeding of ca. 1% per year (as shown by 5.3), i.e. an\u000d\u000a      extra 760,000 kg from a single male bird after 4 years, with these\u000d\u000a      benefits cumulating across all male birds used in the breeding nucleus,\u000d\u000a      and also cumulating over years with each successful round of selection.\u000d\u000a    Increased precision of selection further increases these gains: Aviagen\u000d\u000a      implemented genomic selection in 2012 and an improvement of 20% in the\u000d\u000a      identification of genetically superior males would lead to a further\u000d\u000a      152,000 kg of meat per nucleus male breeding bird per year. Aviagen's\u000d\u000a      activities lead to 50% of the world's marketed chicken and &gt;50% of the\u000d\u000a      world's turkey.\u000d\u000a    Further, scientists controlling the Aviagen breeding programmes are\u000d\u000a      almost entirely Edinburgh trained, and The Roslin Institute currently\u000d\u000a      advises Aviagen on its breeding strategies and on optimal implementation\u000d\u000a      of genomic selection.\u000d\u000a    Impacting pigs\u000d\u000a      Optimal contribution theory has enabled efficient and sustainable breeding\u000d\u000a      programmes to be implemented in many species, and it is the key to\u000d\u000a      efficient long-term exploitation of both traditional and genomic\u000d\u000a      selection. Its current impact is best illustrated through interactions\u000d\u000a      with Genus, formerly PIC, which runs the world's largest pig breeding\u000d\u000a      programme [5.1].\u000d\u000a    Genus currently has a 36% share of the \"technified\" (improved genetics)\u000d\u000a      segment of global pork production, which comprises 40% of global pork\u000d\u000a      production. Therefore, Genus contributes the genetics for 14% of total\u000d\u000a      global pork production.\u000d\u000a    A LINK-funded project \"Sustainable use of animal genetic resources\"\u000d\u000a      (1999-2002) involving Roslin, SRUC, Genus and two other partners\u000d\u000a      identified optimal contribution theory as the single most potent\u000d\u000a      technology to bring an immediate clear improvement to the breeding system,\u000d\u000a      with a predicted 10-25% increase in genetic gain [5.4]. This extra gain\u000d\u000a      was assessed using software [5.5] developed through a joint Roslin\u000d\u000a      initiative, which is now widely used within the breeding industry. Genus\u000d\u000a      implemented these concepts through placement of a geneticist within the\u000d\u000a      Roslin Institute, from 2002 onwards.\u000d\u000a    Optimal contribution theory was first implemented into Genus breeding\u000d\u000a      programmes in May 2003, however the major benefits have arisen since its\u000d\u000a      use was scaled up after 2008. The company currently uses optimal\u000d\u000a      contribution theory to optimize selection and matings, on a weekly basis,\u000d\u000a      in 33 GN status lines from 10 farms on 4 continents.

Critically, as well as being used\u000d\u000a      to identify the locations of gene variants affecting phenotypes, SNP\u000d\u000a      arrays can also be used to make whole genome prediction of genetic merit\u000d\u000a      for complex traits (recently exemplified for height in humans [3.2], led\u000d\u000a      by Visscher). Based upon this original work, the application of whole\u000d\u000a      genome prediction to animal breeding was developed further by Meuwissen et\u000d\u000a      al. [3.3] and is now standard in dairy cattle breeding programmes.\u000d\u000a      Further, recent advances led by Prof. Woolliams (Group leader, Roslin\u000d\u000a      Institute and UoE, employed 1977-onwards) [3.4, 3.5] have guided\u000d\u000a      implementation in dairy cattle and more recently in the poultry industry.\u000d\u000a      Pig and beef industries now also implement this technology.\u000d\u000a    The basic concept of genomic selection is that a dense SNP chip can `tag'\u000d\u000a      every chromosomal `segment' of an individual, and with pre-calibrated data\u000d\u000a      the genetic merit of an animal for any measureable performance trait can\u000d\u000a      be predicted accurately. Potentially this revolutionises breeding\u000d\u000a      practices, allowing identification of genetically superior animals\u000d\u000a      essentially at birth. This makes breeding programmes more efficient, and\u000d\u000a      allows selection for traits that would otherwise pose huge logistical\u000d\u000a      difficulties, e.g. disease resistance, product quality or environmental\u000d\u000a      impact.\u000d\u000a    The greater the efficiency of a breeding programme, the greater the\u000d\u000a      danger of unintended side effects arising from erosion of genetic\u000d\u000a      variability, genetic bottlenecks and inbreeding. Research at Roslin\u000d\u000a      addressed and solved this problem, and provided the tools to implement the\u000d\u000a      solutions in practice. Specifically, optimal contribution theory,\u000d\u000a      developed and published by Prof. Woolliams in 1999 [3.6], provided the\u000d\u000a      theoretical basis to balance genetic selection and conservation of genetic\u000d\u000a      resources (including avoidance of inbreeding). This theory now has now\u000d\u000a      been extended by Woolliams and colleagues to include genomic selection\u000d\u000a      using dense SNP chips.\u000d\u000a    Through industrial collaboration, Roslin-led research (Woolliams)\u000d\u000a      produced software to evaluate and implement these solutions. All major\u000d\u000a      breeding programmes in the intensive breeding industries (pigs and\u000d\u000a      poultry) are now guided by this theory and its principles.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25832","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research provided the original observation that food protein\u000d\u000a      functionality can be enhanced by control of denaturation, aggregation and\u000d\u000a      glycation during heat treatment. Protein modification could be controlled\u000d\u000a      in real time during processing using a relatively inexpensive light\u000d\u000a      scattering geometry. The understanding of underlying structural protein\u000d\u000a      modifications translated this laboratory observation into technology for\u000d\u000a      deployment in industrial food manufacturing conditions. Market Research\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the University and Scottish Enterprise identified an\u000d\u000a      opportunity for a new company delivering in-process real time monitoring\u000d\u000a      technology for thermal processing of proteins conducted by food ingredient\u000d\u000a      manufacturers. This technology offers efficient quality control procedures\u000d\u000a      for industrial manufacturing of food proteins with improved functional\u000d\u000a      properties. Historically, quality control methods for denaturated food\u000d\u000a      proteins were complex, expensive and time consuming and not possible to\u000d\u000a      conduct in factory processing conditions in real time. The novel\u000d\u000a      ingredients are used as fat replacers in yoghurt and cheese and cakes and\u000d\u000a      to replace E-numbers. Rival technologies exist to create fat replacers\u000d\u000a      from whey and egg white proteins using expensive microparticulation\u000d\u000a      machinery, but are owned by non-UK companies with resulting products\u000d\u000a      imported and sold at a high price. Through Nandi, this technology offers\u000d\u000a      food ingredient companies a tool to improve the functionality of their\u000d\u000a      protein ingredients and to deliver products with standardised, reliable\u000d\u000a      quality.\u000d\u000a    Obesity is a major challenge facing the health of the UK population,\u000d\u000a      blamed on combination of diet and lifestyle. Yet consumers have been\u000d\u000a      resistant to reduced fat foods on grounds of \"mouth feel\", taste and\u000d\u000a      suspicions of E numbers. Proteins such as egg and whey protein with\u000d\u000a      enhanced functionality offer improved sensory properties compared to\u000d\u000a      starch based fat replacers. Many commercially available bakery products\u000d\u000a      contain emulsifiers and foaming ingredients with E-numbers which could be\u000d\u000a      replaced by proteins with enhanced functionality. Also, in \"mature\"\u000d\u000a      markets, such as Western Europe, the trend for \"clean label\" foods\u000d\u000a      containing fewer E-numbers is growing. The market opportunity in the UK\u000d\u000a      for the application of novel protein products to deliver new ambient\u000d\u000a      stable-foamed food products is in excess of &#163;100 million, and novel\u000d\u000a      ingredients that act as fat mimetics is a significant technology platform\u000d\u000a      with a market excess of &#163;400 million in the UK alone. Currently the UK and\u000d\u000a      European market for protein based fat replacers is dominated by one or two\u000d\u000a      large dairy companies and is limited to whey protein. Small to medium size\u000d\u000a      cheese manufacturing companies, which reflect the trend towards consumer\u000d\u000a      preferences for \"local\" products cannot afford to implement facilities to\u000d\u000a      add value to whey protein and it is either sold as a commodity product or\u000d\u000a      processed as waste. The commodity whey protein EU market is approximately\u000d\u000a      300 million Euros. The technology developed by Nandi Proteins offers the\u000d\u000a      possibility of processing this whey stream to a higher value product.\u000d\u000a      Nandi Proteins expects to be able to access 10% of this whey market within\u000d\u000a      the next five years.\u000d\u000a    In forming Nandi, Scottish Enterprise, with venture capital company Sigma\u000d\u000a      Technology Management Ltd provided development funding and the business\u000d\u000a      and technical support required to form business partnerships and provide\u000d\u000a      proof of principle to food ingredient companies. Heriot-Watt University\u000d\u000a      provided commercialisation support via Research and Enterprise Services,\u000d\u000a      use of bench scale processing and analytical equipment in the School of\u000d\u000a      Life Sciences in addition to funding salaries of core staff. The\u000d\u000a      analytical support was important as the company could not have funded\u000d\u000a      equipment purchase. The physico-chemical modifications of new food\u000d\u000a      ingredients and associated functionality in food applications require\u000d\u000a      corroboration by sophisticated analytical equipment and methods, important\u000d\u000a      in building customer confidence in the technology.\u000d\u000a    Nandi Proteins Ltd. employs 3 people (two at PhD level) and will create a\u000d\u000a      4th (PhD level) position in 2013\/2014. The employees demonstrate the use\u000d\u000a      of the monitoring technology and to work alongside customers to prove the\u000d\u000a      principle of enhanced ingredient functionality in food. Nandi's business\u000d\u000a      model is to license the technology to customers and not to manufacture its\u000d\u000a      own products. The first fat replacement product was launched by Friesland\u000d\u000a      Campina DMV in the Netherlands. [S2] DMV has produced protein using Nandi\u000d\u000a      technology on a commercial scale and has marketed this as Hiprotal 60. The\u000d\u000a      product was sold into the dairy and formulated meat products market within\u000d\u000a      Europe. Sales of 200 tonnes per annum are claimed over a production period\u000d\u000a      of 2007-2011. Hiprotal 60 sold at &#163;6 per kilo which equates to approximate\u000d\u000a      sales of &#163;6M over the five year production period. In addition, Friesland\u000d\u000a      has incorporated Hiprotal 60 as fat replacer in products such as a low fat\u000d\u000a      yoghurt drink Dutch Lady, sold widely in Malaysia. The rights to Hiprotal\u000d\u000a      60 product manufacture and sales were transferred in 2012 to Rovita GmbH,\u000d\u000a      a German ingredient manufacturing company which sells and markets the whey\u000d\u000a      products as Roviprod 60.\u000d\u000a    Nandi also has contracts with Premier Foods, the UK's largest food\u000d\u000a      company. Nandi's latest patent application was acquired by Tate &amp; Lyle\u000d\u000a      Investments on behalf of Tate &amp; Lyle Food ingredients in December\u000d\u000a      2012, and is a central part of their food development strategy. The\u000d\u000a      agreement grants Tate &amp; Lyle an exclusive worldwide licence for the\u000d\u000a      technology for food and beverage use while Nandi Proteins Ltd retains the\u000d\u000a      rights to develop the technology for other applications such as\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical. Tate &amp; Lyle are responsible for developing and in due\u000d\u000a      course commercialising the technology including its manufacturing,\u000d\u000a      applications development, sales and marketing. This has brought a high\u000d\u000a      level of investment to Nandi Proteins (&#163;3M).

An enduring problem for the\u000d\u000a      food industry is that one of the main ingredients of formulated food\u000d\u000a      products, namely globular proteins such as egg, milk and soy protein, are\u000d\u000a      inherently unstable on heating due to denaturation of the protein\u000d\u000a      structure. In many foods this manifests itself as a breakdown in the food\u000d\u000a      structure and loss of product quality. Both Campbell and Euston researched\u000d\u000a      the role of heat-treated egg and milk proteins on emulsion stability in\u000d\u000a      the 1990s when working in the food industry (Campbell at Nestle and Euston\u000d\u000a      at Fonterra). Euston was interested in the mechanisms of instability of\u000d\u000a      milk whey protein-stabilised emulsions and how this was influenced by\u000d\u000a      interaction with other food ingredients (Euston, et al.

This research was extended to PhD studies on soy [G2],\u000d\u000a      whey [G4] (PhD student Zhang), and cowpea proteins [G4] (Ahmed,\u000d\u000a      2010-2013).

To quote\u000a      a former Director of\u000a      Brewing Operations of a US regional brewery and Past President of the\u000a      Master Brewers of the\u000a      Americas[S1],\u000a    \"The benefit of high-gravity brewing is something I've come to appreciate\u000a      throughout my brewing\u000a      career, and Professor Stewart clearly served as an authority and as an\u000a      elucidator into underpinning\u000a      effects of high-gravity brewing on yeast and in finished beer.\u000a      What we all take for granted today is that high-gravity brewing has\u000a      offered the most significant\u000a      efficiency and productivity gain for any brewery in the world. It's been\u000a      the most important means to\u000a      increase plant capacity that brewing has ever experienced.\"\u000a    This same source [S1] has estimated the strength of US worts increased\u000a      from 15oP in 1993 to\u000a      20oP in 2008 and 21oP in 2013. In his regional\u000a      brewery the starting wort strength of their flagship\u000a      brand went from 10.8oP in 1997 to 12.4oP in 2008 to\u000a      13.2oP in 2011[S1]. A second source has\u000a      supplied worldwide estimates for starting wort strengths of 14oP\u000a      in 1993 increasing to 17oP in 2008\u000a      reaching 18oP in 2013 [S2].\u000a    This increase and the resulting economic impact made possible by the\u000a      contribution of Professor\u000a      Stewart's research are difficult to measure. However, one source [S3] has\u000a      indicated that a 50%\u000a      expansion of an 11.4 million hL\/yr&#167;&#167;&#167; brewery built in 2007 in\u000a      the US would cost approximately 50\u000a      million US Dollars. If one assumes this brewery made an\u000a      increase of 5% in wort gravity (and\u000a      assumes a linear interpolation of the above quoted expansion costs) the\u000a      savings of using HG-wort\u000a      to forgo capital expansion would be 5 million USD or 0.438 USD\/hL.\u000a      In the US, the volume of beer\u000a      sold in 2011 was 225 million hL [S4]. If all US breweries increased the\u000a      wort strength by 5% this\u000a      would translate to capital savings of 98.6 x 106 USD or &#163;65\u000a      million. It is notable that this cost\u000a      estimate is based on US beer production alone. The world beer\u000a      market was 1,925 million hL 2011!\u000a      [S4]\u000a    Aside from direct savings in forgoing capital expansion by the use of\u000a      HG-wort, additional and\u000a      substantial savings result by the enhancement of sustainability in energy,\u000a      effluent, cleaning costs,\u000a      production flexibility and overall beer quality and stability. These\u000a      savings are substantial but difficult\u000a      to quantify. However, the savings in cleaning chemical costs alone\u000a      by the use of HG-wort\u000a      (therefore reducing vessels usage) has been estimated to range from 0.25\u000a      to 1.00 USD\/hL produced [S5].\u000a    In addition, the world alcohol industry, totalling 825 million hL in 2012\u000a      [S6] has benefited from\u000a      Prof. Stewart's research into minimizing yeast stress (Cunningham and\u000a      Stewart, 2000) allowing\u000a      increased efficiencies in the ethanol fermentation process when HG\u000a      substrates are used. The\u000a      resulting higher (fermenter) ethanol levels in turn, reduce the energy\u000a      required for distillation. For\u000a      example, the starting wort densities of a major Scottish grain whisky\u000a      producer have increased 13%\u000a      from 1993 to 2008 and 1.9% from 2008 to 2013. In the case of malt whisky,\u000a      starting wort values\u000a      have increased 3.5% from 1993 to 2008 and 1.7% in 2013 from 1993 values\u000a      [S7].\u000a    The Scotch whisky industry alone produced 3.48 x 106 hL (on a\u000a      pure ethanol basis) in the year\u000a      ending October 2012 [S8]. These increases and subsequent capacity savings\u000a      are not as dramatic\u000a      as in the brewing sector but still contribute very substantially to\u000a      companies bottom-line by reducing\u000a      energy expenditures in the distillation process.\u000a    Therefore, by even the most conservative of estimates, the research\u000a        undertaken a Heriot-Watt\u000a        University from 1993 to 2008 has resulted in worldwide savings of &#163;555\u000a        million&#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; in capital cost\u000a        savings of the brewing industries alone during 2008-2013.\u000a    &#167;&#167;&#167; hL = hectolitre (100 Litres).\u000a    &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 1.925x10^9 hL* 0.438 USD\/hL x 0.66 &#163;\/USD.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In High Gravity (HG) brewing the substrate (the wort&#167;)\u000a      fermented by the yeast is concentrated\u000a      from a traditional value of about 12% solids to concentrations of upwards\u000a      of 20%.

The majority of these publications investigated the\u000a      high gravity brewing\u000a      process (for reviews see Stewart, 2009; Stewart and Murray, 2012). This\u000a      process of creating a HG-\u000a      wort is relatively simple and can be done by either concentrated brewing,\u000a      or more commonly, by\u000a      adding sugar syrups to a normal wort (of ~12oP or 12% solids)\u000a      to reach 15 to 21oP. However, this\u000a      high osmotic substrate has negative effects on: 1) beer foam stability, 2)\u000a      yeast fermentation\u000a      performance and 3) final beer flavour. From 1993 to 2008, Professor\u000a      Stewart's team pioneered\u000a      research aimed at solving all three issues. He has been honoured by the\u000a      Master Brewers of\u000a      Americas, the American Society of Brewing Chemists and the Institute of\u000a      Brewing and Distilling\u000a      primarily for his work on understanding and providing industrial solutions\u000a      to these problems.\u000a    Beer Foam Stability &#8212; In addressing the problem of low foam\u000a      stability caused by the use of HG-\u000a      wort, Cooper, Stewart and Bryce [1] linked the higher level of yeast\u000a      proteinase-A present in HG-wort\u000a      to a loss in foam enhancing hydrophobic polypeptides in the fermentation\u000a      process. While it\u000a      had been previously suggested that hydrophobic foam enhancing substances\u000a      were lost due to\u000a      foaming in the fermenter, Cooper et al. [1] found this not to be true.\u000a      This and related reports alerted\u000a      brewers to the cause of poor foam stability and allowed them to take\u000a      measures to increase the\u000a      creation of foam active substances in the brewing process helping\u000a      alleviate the action of\u000a      proteinase-A.\u000a    Yeast Fermentation Performance &#8212; In high gravity brewing, the\u000a      yeast is stressed more than\u000a      usual, resulting in poor viability and performance when the yeast crop is\u000a      reused or `re-cropped'\u000a      during repeated fermentations. This problem was addressed by a number of\u000a      publications by the\u000a      Stewart research team. Notably, Cunningham and Stewart [2] reported that\u000a      acid washing&#167;&#167; of the\u000a      yeast from HG-wort resulted in poor fermentation performance and\u000a      recommended the use of\u000a      oxygenation to enhance yeast performance in HG-worts. This practice of\u000a      HG-wort oxygenation\u000a      enhanced both fermentation performance and extended the number of\u000a      fermentations the yeast\u000a      could be repitched, both major economic concerns of the industry.\u000a    Final Beer Flavour &#8212; When the first HG-worts were produced,\u000a      brewers had great difficulty\u000a      flavour-matching a brand of beer produced by normal strength (i.e.,\u000a      gravity) wort to the same beer\u000a      brewed with HG-wort and then diluted. The first HG-worts were produced by\u000a      adding high glucose\u000a      syrups to normal gravity wort. In elegant work by Younis and Stewart [5]\u000a      it was found that, while\u000a      yeast-strain specific, the use of maltose based syrups, along with\u000a      an increase of other\u000a      wort nutrients improved flavour matching of normal to HG-wort beers. This\u000a      breakthrough should\u000a      not be understated. It is notable that following Professor Stewart's work,\u000a      the majority of large\u000a      brewers now use maltose-based syrups to produce their HG-worts.\u000a    &#167;&#167; A technique used to rid the yeast of bacterial contaminants.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28293","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research programme on improving soil and foliar disease control in\u000d\u000a      greenhouse production\u000d\u000a      systems at Newcastle University between 2000 and 2013 has led to the\u000d\u000a      development of integrated\u000d\u000a      crop management protocols for the control of soil-borne and foliar\u000d\u000a      diseases in organic and soil-based\u000d\u000a      greenhouse crop production systems across Europe.

Mastitis is one\u000a      of the most important diseases of farmed livestock and is financially the\u000a      most significant disease of dairy cattle, causing annual production losses\u000a      of more than &#163;170M in the UK and US$ 2.0B in the USA. The welfare\u000a      implications of mastitis are severe and the impact of bovine mastitis on\u000a      the environment is also important. In Great Britain the incidence of the\u000a      mastitis in dairy cattle is between 47 and 65 cases per 100 cows per year.\u000a    The key element of mastitis control is to prevent new intramammary\u000a      infections and this means understanding when they occur. Prior to 1998,\u000a      understanding of the importance of the dry period as a time for new\u000a      intramammary infections was virtually non-existent. A series of papers\u000a      over the next 5 years from the researchers who are currently at\u000a      Nottingham, using sophisticated molecular epidemiology, clearly\u000a      demonstrated that dry period intramammary infections were an important\u000a      source of mastitis in many dairy herds. This and the programme of Prof.\u000a      Green and colleagues at UoN from 2006 onwards, revealed that the rate of\u000a      clinical mastitis after calving could be used as an excellent indicator of\u000a      dry period infections; that there is important variation between farms in\u000a      patterns of bacterial isolates during the dry period; and that a variety\u000a      of farm, cow and environment factors influence the risk of dry period\u000a      infections and subsequent bouts of clinical and subclinical mastitis.\u000a      Further research using modern Bayesian statistical techniques, identified\u000a      that it is essential to account for variation between farms and\u000a      uncertainty of the effects of interventions to optimise clinical decision\u000a      making to prevent dry period infections.\u000a    This UoN-led programme of research has led to a complete change in the\u000a      understanding of new intramammary infections and an entirely new approach\u000a      to control of the disease. The benefits for animal welfare are clear, with\u000a      reduced incidence of infection, and consequently the dairy industry\u000a      benefits financially. The effect of the research is seen in the following\u000a      areas:\u000a    Change in the approach to mastitis control - Current control\u000a      programmes now focus on identifying the magnitude and importance of dry\u000a      period infections on a unit and then adapting control measures to focus on\u000a      dry period management and preventive treatments as required (Sources\u000a        3-6). Independent international disease\/welfare reports cite this\u000a      research to indicate that the monitoring and control of dry period\u000a      intramammary infections are essential (Source 5).\u000a    The development and widespread use of non-antibiotic teat sealants\u000a      to prevent disease has been heavily based on the research described in\u000a      this statement (Source 1). The use of `OrbeSeal' (an internal\u000a      non-antibiotic teat sealant) has increased dramatically since 2008 both in\u000a      the UK and worldwide. Approximately 30-40% of UK dairy cows now receive\u000a      the product and tens of millions of doses of the product are sold per\u000a      annum worldwide (NB: exact sales figures are strictly confidential &#8212; Source\u000a        1 can be approached if required).\u000a    Development of on-farm software - Pfizer (now Zoetis Animal\u000a      Health) commissioned research to develop a stochastic (probabilistic)\u000a      simulation model to incorporate the UoN research results, to enhance\u000a      decision-making in dry period management. This software is currently in\u000a      use (Source 1). The software model uses the dynamics of dry period\u000a      infection and information about risks and management interventions to help\u000a      an individual dairy herd make management decisions. The tool allows the\u000a      evaluation of management interventions and predicts the probability of a\u000a      return on investment for each intervention (or combinations thereof) being\u000a      considered. This software was launched in 2012 and the Area Veterinary\u000a      Manager of Zoetis stated 'Zoetis have launched a dry cow management on\u000a        farm decision tool, designed from research conducted at the University\u000a        of Nottingham, by Prof Martin Green and colleagues. The new tool will\u000a        give veterinary surgeons a platform to offer better evidence based\u000a        solutions for dry cow management which should result in significant\u000a        benefits in disease levels, farm finances and cow welfare\" (Source\u000a        1). The tool is particularly useful in enhancing discussions between\u000a      advisors and farmers, and different approaches to mastitis control and in\u000a      this respect will perform a useful function as an additional resource for\u000a      mastitis advisors participating in the UK national mastitis control scheme\u000a      (DairyCo Mastitis Control Plan &#8212; www.mastitiscontrolplan.co.uk).\u000a    Development of commercial software - key commercial software\u000a      packages have been developed to monitor dry period infection rates (Herd\u000a        Companion, TotalVet and Interherd software), which\u000a      use indices based on UoN research. These allow vets to routinely monitor\u000a      dry period infections and improve disease control (Source 2). The\u000a      underpinning research for all of the above areas of impact concerning dry\u000a      period mastitis was provided by the listed UoN staff and incorporates\u000a      prolonged and varied research in this area.\u000a    As described above, the impact of this research extends to an\u000a      international stage. Further evidence of this is a project commissioned in\u000a      2013 to evaluate dry period infection dynamics in several European\u000a      countries including Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

These studies enhanced\u000a        the understanding of disease patterns and dynamics and were the first to\u000a        concurrently examine cow characteristics, farm facilities, and herd\u000a        management strategies during the dry period that influence the rate of\u000a        clinical mastitis and raised somatic cell counts in the following\u000a        lactation [1, 2]. Results, for the first time, identified\u000a        workable, non-antibiotic methods to reduce the impact of dry period\u000a        infections. These key studies [a &amp; c] also highlighted the\u000a        importance of selecting appropriate dry cow treatments for individual\u000a        cows rather than on a herd basis and this, alongside earlier work on the\u000a        use of teat sealants, has dramatically improved the understanding of dry\u000a        cow therapy. For example, whilst the use of antibiotics in combination\u000a        with teat sealants has been shown to be beneficial for cows with\u000a        intramammary infections at drying off, their combination use in\u000a        uninfected cows was shown to be potentially damaging, especially in low\u000a        somatic cell count herds [3]. The complexity of choices\u000a        surrounding dry cow management and therapies led to further research\u000a        (described below) around optimising clinical decision making during this\u000a        period.\u000a      \u000aResearch to quantify the uncertainty in, and make predictions for\u000a          dry period interventions &#8212; The between-herd variation in infection\u000a        dynamics and the uncertainty associated with strategic preventive\u000a        strategies were evaluated using Bayesian modelling techniques.\u000a        Predictions were made to quantify the outcome of dry period control\u000a        methods so that clinical decision-making could be optimised [4; a].\u000a        This work was extended by identifying herd-specific predictors for the\u000a        occurrence of dry period infections [5] and a new method to\u000a        predict milk losses that arise from dry period infections [6; c\u000a          &amp; d]. The richness in these data was combined to provide a\u000a        novel probabilistic herd decision-making tool that takes into account\u000a        specific farm circumstances and provides probabilities of specific\u000a        health and economic outcomes [c]. This system was developed with\u000a        help of Zoetis Animal Health and is currently being used by dairy herd\u000a        advisors (Source 1 below).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28722","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A significant proportion of cereal production and other carbohydrate\u000a      sources are used as animal and pet feed materials. The petfood market in\u000a      the UK for cats and dogs alone is &#163;2.4BN, and the European market is worth\u000a      &#8364;13.5BN per annum. The animal feed industry utilises 50% of UK cereal\u000a      production and is a major consumer of imported maize each year. A\u000a      scientific framework that allows materials and process conditions to be\u000a      matched for optimal manufacture is a useful contribution to minimising\u000a      wastage and improving product quality.\u000a    UoN research has had a major influence on animal feed producers, many of\u000a      which have initiated further research projects with Professor Hill to\u000a      elicit a better understanding of their processes and how these can be\u000a      modified to achieve optimum levels. The work was disseminated to the\u000a      industries, where it is most relevant, through a series of conferences and\u000a      invited talks to companies about this subject (Source 5). The\u000a      degree of penetration of the topic has been such that the concept of\u000a      starch conversion, coined by UoN researchers [1], is now used\u000a      within the industry to illustrate the complex series of changes that occur\u000a      to starch as it is broken down. Modelling the changes to the starches as\u000a      they were hydrated, heated and sheared has provided companies with new\u000a      options for their processing lines. This allows for optimisation of the\u000a      current processes or the use of different technologies so that the\u000a      required product quality, in terms of energy yield and palatability, can\u000a      be achieved. The impact of our research is significant in three major\u000a      areas. These are:\u000a    A) Implementation of revised processing strategies for feeds\u000a    B) Upgrading of analytical techniques to establish nutrient\u000a      benefits of animal feeds\u000a    C) Extension of possible resources for animal feeds through novel\u000a      processing\u000a    An example of A) that shows that a company altering their\u000a      processing regime to optimise nutritive performance comes from a quote\u000a      from the Head of Monogastric Development at BOCMPauls, a major UK animal\u000a      feed manufacturer. \"Data generated showed that with correct thermo\u000a        mechanical processing, the rate of starch degradation in-vitro, as\u000a        measured by glucose release, is significantly improved. This information\u000a        has been incorporated in to our piglet starter diet formulations as part\u000a        of our new product development programme. The new diets have\u000a        demonstrated enhanced performance whilst controlling nutritional scours\u000a        which can develop as a consequence of undigested starch passing into the\u000a        hind gut.\" (Source 1). Further quotes from the company also\u000a      indicate that they are utilising the battery of analytical methods\u000a      developed by UoN (B). These are now robust enough and the\u000a      understanding of the relationship between nutrition and processing\u000a      sufficiently well-established and measurable, to enable environmental\u000a      issues to be dealt with in the holistic mix. \"The extrusion process is\u000a        an energy hungry process, however the input of adequate specific\u000a        mechanical energy is critical in getting the benefits of the thermo\u000a        mechanical processing. The data generated (from research\u000a      programme e and f) has helped with developing methodologies for\u000a        quantifying the relationship between energy in and benefits out for the\u000a        extrusion process. By doing this we are now able to optimise production\u000a        conditions and therefore minimise units of electrical energy consumed\u000a        per tonne of product.\" This company has put a monetary value for\u000a      this understanding in terms of energy saving \"Under \"normal use\" the\u000a        extruder would be consuming around &#163;10 worth of electricity per tonne of\u000a        throughput. We saw that with careful optimisation we could save in the\u000a        order of 5% of this cost with no negative effect on physical quality or\u000a        starch gelatinisation.\" (Source 1).\u000a    An example of utilisation of understanding of processing and how this can\u000a      be manipulated to use materials not previously commercially viable as\u000a      feeds (C) is being exploited by the livestock feed company Dodson\u000a      and Horrell. They are using understanding of processing generated\u000a      by UoN to study a material considered as a co-product from the brewing\u000a      industry (brewers' grain) as an animal feed stock. In a statement on the\u000a      UoN work on brewers grains, the Director and Consultant Nutritionist of\u000a      Dodson and Horrell commented that the work was \"promising in terms of\u000a        reducing final product cost, utilisation of a feed ingredient that\u000a        previously had only been considered as a ruminant feed as a replacement\u000a        for a proportion of cereal content and as a protein source.\" (Source\u000a        2).\u000a    UoN facilities, expertise and willingness to work with industrial\u000a      partners have also allowed a route for serendipitous exploitation of\u000a      ideas. An example of one such case is the use of the pilot scale equipment\u000a      within the School of Biosciences and Professor Hill's research expertise\u000a      on extruded starches, to investigate the possibility of extruding silage\u000a      to create a novel feed for horses, which is now being manufactured by\u000a      Dodson and Horrell on a commercial scale. \"Studies in the Food science\u000a        department, utilising their extruder and understanding of extrusion\u000a        technologies has enabled Dodson &amp; Horrell to develop a unique\u000a        extruded whole-crop maize product for horses. This product satisfies a\u000a        number of criteria, in that the yield per hectare is high relative to\u000a        other feed materials, it is produced local to the D&amp;H mill\u000a        (environmental criteria), as a high energy feed for horses replaces a\u000a        human food material (oats, human food criteria) and does not occupy farm\u000a        ground that would be used for human food as the maize forms an ideal\u000a        break-crop within the farm cereal production cycle. Dodson &amp;\u000a        Horrell has launched this feed ingredient in its performance and\u000a        competition feeds and has maintained horses feed sales in an otherwise\u000a        falling market place\" (Source 2).\u000a    Those working within the animal feed industry need robust predictors of\u000a      animal performance and the use of the battery of tests UoN developed\u000a      through the LINK programmes have helped establish a range of in vitro\u000a      tests that indicate in vivo performance. This has led to\u000a      publications by ABVista (an international supplier of animal feed\u000a      ingredients) and their sponsoring of the implementation of these ideas.\u000a      The work has led to a new classification of maize samples so that the\u000a      company can differentiate itself from other companies by targeting its\u000a      animal feed enzymes to the maize variants. The company uses an online corn\u000a      quality assessment (Source 3) as part of their sales tools and part\u000a      of the validation of this has been carried out with the University of\u000a      Nottingham. A quote from a research manager at ABVista states (Source 4),\u000a      \"Optimising the methodology has allowed us to improve our experimental\u000a        efficiency and reduce costs. For example in this last budget year we\u000a        have saved significant amounts of money by not commissioning\u000a        digestibility studies which we now know are inappropriate. For example,\u000a        an animal trial may carry a cost of &#163;25,000\". \"Such information\u000a        is essential for us to maintain our position in a highly competitive\u000a        environment and to enable us to move forward and expand our sales in all\u000a        markets. It is impossible to put an exact value on such research, but it\u000a        would be impossible for us to stay competitive without it.\"\u000a    The combined knowledge of material changes during processing and animal\u000a      nutritional quality makes UoN an obvious first port of call for companies\u000a      looking to establish improved and novel processing for animal feeds. For\u000a      example Professor Hill took part in and organised a number of workshops\u000a      (five between 2008 and 2011) that helped shape the strategy and basis for\u000a      the Mars Petcare business (Source 5). A further example of the\u000a      impact of the understanding of nutrition and processing understanding is\u000a      demonstrated by GA Petfoods. This company are developing a novel process\u000a      and between 2010 and 2013 they invested &#163;18 million for the innovative\u000a      manufacture of dry pet foods. To aid in the success of this venture a\u000a      knowledge partnership was established with Professors Wiseman and Hill as,\u000a      \"the group in Biosciences at Nottingham University are leaders in this\u000a        field and have a proven record of industrial co-operation.\" \"Their\u000a        knowledge will help assure that the investment is beneficial and will\u000a        allow greater penetration of the UK and European pet food market\" (Source\u000a        6).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Nottingham (UoN) has transferred an understanding of\u000a      how starchy foods are modified by processing, attained through working\u000a      with human foods, to the animal feed industry.

In addition to the sanitisation\u000a      of product, this treatment may cause the feed to become more palatable and\u000a      improve the dietary energy value following digestion. To understand the\u000a      interactions between processing and feed quality, it is essential that\u000a      changes to the native raw dietary materials are understood in terms of how\u000a      the physical and chemical structures alter during processing. By weight,\u000a      the most important components of feed raw materials are carbohydrates and,\u000a      of these, the starches dominate in terms of energy value and the materials\u000a      that provide most of the structuring of the feed.\u000a    There is a long history of materials science at UoN that underpins food\u000a      processing. Investigations, which started in the 1980s, have continued to\u000a      develop the concept of starch hydration and the changes within native\u000a      starch to render it amorphous and create a stable glass or a more mobile\u000a      rubbery material. Many projects elucidating structures were funded through\u000a      LINK Schemes and collaborative projects between the food science group at\u000a      UoN and industry [a &amp; b]. Predictive models for starch\u000a      recrystallization from the rubber (retrogradation), resistant starch\u000a      formation and physical aging (densification of starch stored in the\u000a      rubbery state) in starch materials, that were generated by Professor Hill\u000a      and colleagues, reinforced much of the thinking for the manufacture of\u000a      snack foods, breakfast cereals and many extruded products [a-d]\u000a      for human consumption. Groups of companies were introduced to the concept\u000a      of \"starch conversion\" through a range of grants and dissemination events.\u000a      For the state of starch to be described, multiple factors such as shear,\u000a      chemical degradation, water content and temperature needed to be\u000a      considered [c &amp; d]. A feature of the work to investigate the\u000a      behaviour of the starches was the development of a new battery of tests by\u000a      UoN. This allowed studies to be applicable to foods and film for packages\u000a      [1, 3 &amp; 4]. In addition understanding of the changes occurring\u000a      to proteins during processing were developed and methods found to assess\u000a      changes in their functionality [2 &amp; 5].\u000a    Alongside this work on the properties of starch, protocols that\u000a      demonstrated the energy utilisation of feeds were established by Professor\u000a      Wiseman at UoN using both chick and pig models [6]. A series of\u000a      projects [e &amp; f] looked at the biomaterials (the cereal\u000a      sources and the processing of the materials) and related these to the\u000a      animals' performance. It was shown that some of the processes that\u000a      manufacturers were undertaking to produce feeds did not have the desired\u000a      changes upon macromolecular ordering they had assumed were occurring. The\u000a      research also demonstrated that different raw materials could be used in\u000a      feeds, but only if the manufacturing processes were altered to allow for\u000a      the change in characteristics of the ingredients [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28723","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A sustained body of work by the named key researchers spanning 20 years\u000a      (of which 12 have been at UoN) provided the initial, and strengthened the\u000a      current, evidence base in favour of developmental programming effects upon\u000a      adult health and disease. The UoN researchers are among a number of\u000a      prominent UK groups that take a lead role in studying the early life\u000a      programming phenomenon and shaping the positions and policies of public\u000a      health bodies (also Universities of Cambridge, Southampton- where Prof.\u000a      Langley-Evans initiated this work- and Kings College London). The total\u000a      body of UK and international work has prompted several expert committees,\u000a      global organisations and high impact journals (e.g. The New England\u000a      Journal of Medicine, Source 1) to make specific recommendations\u000a      about maternal and infant health. The British Medical Association\u000a      published `Early Life Nutrition and Lifelong Health' in 2009 as a\u000a      point of reference with key messages about maternal, fetal and infant\u000a      nutrition for healthcare professionals to disseminate to the wider public.\u000a      The approach of the BMA Board of Science is to provide a clear synthesis\u000a      of the available research, and to develop evidence-based conclusions and\u000a      recommendations for policy. The BMA report was commissioned after a 2007\u000a      debate that called upon the BMA's Board of Science to recognise and\u000a      promote the importance of fetal and early life nutrition and its\u000a      relationship to lifelong health. The report stated that, \"compelling\u000a        evidence supports a role for early life nutrition in setting the risk of\u000a        other conditions including osteoporosis, asthma, lung disease and some\u000a        forms of cancer and that evidence is growing that early life nutrition\u000a        can play a role in behavioural and cognitive problems in children and\u000a        adolescents, and possibly even in cognitive decline and other aspects of\u000a        ageing\". UoN research [4] contributed evidence to support\u000a      these assertions (Source 2).\u000a    The global company, Nestl&#233; produced a White Paper `Harnessing the\u000a        power of epigenetics for targeted nutrition' (Source 3) in\u000a      which they outlined how they should consider novel approaches for\u000a      harnessing personalised nutrition for use by their end-users, the general\u000a      public. The paper referenced the work of UoN researchers [3] in\u000a      order to support their novel, potential nutraceutical epigenetic approach.\u000a    The Department of Health (DoH) commissioned the Scientific Advisory\u000a      Committee on Nutrition (SACN) to review the evidence for an effect of\u000a      maternal, fetal and child nutrition, including growth and development in\u000a        utero and up to the age of 5 years, on the development of chronic\u000a      disease in later life in the offspring. Part of the SACN remit was to\u000a      identify opportunities for nutritional intervention that could influence\u000a      the risk of chronic disease in later life in the offspring. SACN published\u000a      their report, `The influence of maternal, fetal and child nutrition on the\u000a      development of chronic disease in later life' in 2011 (Source 4).\u000a      Nottingham researchers contributed evidence e.g. [1, 2] among the\u000a      wider body of evidence which informed this review. In their terms of\u000a      reference, SACN stated that, `the evidence associating early life\u000a        nutrition with later risk of chronic disease is variable in quality.\u000a        Most of the human evidence demonstrates associations that are\u000a        susceptible to confounding by environmental and behavioural factors at\u000a        different stages of the life course'. Hence, they also reviewed the\u000a      studies in animal models that had contributed invaluable evidence to\u000a      support the human prospective and retrospective data, stating; `Experimental\u000a        interventions, mainly in animal models, help to ascribe mechanisms that\u000a        may explain the associations observed. As with prospective observational\u000a        studies, the length of the human lifespan places limitations on most\u000a        existing intervention studies in humans, although markers of later risk,\u000a        particularly if validated in animal models, may be useful'. SACN\u000a      made 6 public health recommendations to the DoH. These included a\u000a      recommended strategy to promote, protect and support breastfeeding, to\u000a      optimise the diets and body composition of young women and a research\u000a      recommendation supporting the use of animal models as a means of\u000a      identifying predictive markers of future poor health in humans. In an\u000a      email to Dr Gardner (Source 5), a team leader for nutrition policy\u000a      and advice at the UK DoH stated that, \"SACN's report confirmed that\u000a        maternal diet is an important aspect of fetal and longer term outcomes\u000a        of pregnancy. This reinforced the basis of current Government advice.\u000a        ... This is current Government advice that has been taken as a result of\u000a        the SACN report\".\u000a    Following the SACN recommendations and drawing upon the work of UoN\u000a      researchers, the UK DoH developed websites providing information on\u000a      healthy eating and on good nutrition before, during and after pregnancy (Source\u000a        6). Thus, the scientific context of DOHaD has been encapsulated in\u000a      advice Government is offering the general public &#8212; `optimising lifelong\u000a      health is a key element of national health education programmes' through\u000a      websites such as Change4Life and Start4Life (Source 6). The UK\u000a      Government is not alone in realising the potential health and economic\u000a      implications of DoHAD. The World Health Organisation (WHO) invited Prof.\u000a      Langley- Evans to a workshop event in 2004 (Source 7) considering\u000a      the impact of DOHaD on WHO global strategy and policy for maternal and\u000a      infant health. The outcomes from this workshop (fed-back to the WHO\u000a      officer in charge of their Collaborating Centre on Nutrition Changes and\u000a      Development, Dr Chizuru Nishida, Department of Nutrition, WHO Geneva) made\u000a      the WHO more aware of the impact of nutritional programming in early life\u000a      and subsequently in 2012, WHO proposed global targets and recommendations\u000a      for the nutrition of mothers, infants and young children in order to\u000a      reduce the prevalence of low birth weight (Source 8). In addition,\u000a      UoN researchers have contributed evidence [6] that has challenged\u000a      some of the prevalent views about childhood obesity and which has had an\u000a      international impact. For example, the Australian Government used this\u000a      evidence in an advisory paper for the Productivity Commission (Sep\u000a      2010; Source 9) on the likely longer-term impact of childhood\u000a      obesity. This document was used to inform their strategy for economic\u000a      spend on healthcare. The ultimate beneficiaries of the ongoing UoN\u000a      contribution to global research in this area, are therefore pregnant women\u000a      and their children throughout the world, as the research is a springboard\u000a      for policy changes that will benefit health across the generations.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at the University of Nottingham (UoN) has had influence on\u000a      development of health policy in the UK and internationally.

An individual born relatively\u000a      small or relatively large (each a proxy for challenged intrauterine\u000a      development) has a two- to eight-fold greater risk of dying due to\u000a      ischaemic heart disease or type 2 diabetes in middle- age. The DOHaD\u000a      phenomenon therefore has broad implications for public health and the\u000a      national economic spend on health-related morbidity for generations to\u000a      come. The epidemiological studies in human populations and their\u000a      conclusions received heavy criticism for ascribing cause-and-effect by\u000a      association and inappropriate adjustment for potential confounding factors\u000a      such as current diet, current weight and ethnicity. Hence, suitable animal\u000a      models had to be developed to test DOHaD prospectively and in a controlled\u000a      laboratory environment [c,d]. Prof. Langley-Evans developed the\u000a      first nutrition-related animal model of DOHaD in which pregnant rats fed a\u000a      low protein diet (commonly associated with low birth weight in populations\u000a      with a high prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition) gave birth to\u000a      smaller offspring that developed high blood pressure and an increased\u000a      propensity to other such non-communicable diseases (e.g. chronic kidney\u000a      disease, premature aging, glucose intolerance; [1, 2]). This rat\u000a      model represented a paradigm-shift in the nutritional causation of disease\u000a      and was well-received by the scientific community. Many other groups have\u000a      since repeated the study and replicated the results around the world and\u000a      now use the same approach to drive mechanistic studies of DOHaD.\u000a    UoN investigators also established large animal models of DOHaD, such as\u000a      the nutrient restricted sheep [a, b, e], to allow more detailed\u000a      investigation of the perturbed intrauterine environment arising from\u000a      maternal nutritional imbalance [3,4]. Such work identified the\u000a      early embryo as being particularly susceptible to low methyl-group\u000a      availability &#8212; one of a number of effects of maternal protein-energy\u000a      malnutrition. This and related work using rodent models identified a\u000a      plausible epigenetic mechanism operating during early embryogenesis that\u000a      may underpin DOHaD. More recent work has moved the research to consider\u000a      the impact of nutrition in the early postnatal period, in both animals and\u000a      humans, upon health in adult life. These studies, which have included a\u000a      new human pregnancy cohort study and a series of systematic review papers\u000a      [5,6] have demonstrated that the `window' during which nutritional\u000a      programming of disease risk occurs is wider than originally suspected.\u000a    In summary, Nottingham investigators have generated research that has\u000a      provided the initial evidence to support a role for nutrition during early\u000a      life predisposing to a greater susceptibility toward non-communicable\u000a      disease in adulthood. Having defined the problem and provided insight into\u000a      the mechanistic basis of DOHaD, their research continues in order to\u000a      provide novel solutions to the multifactorial paradigm of the early life\u000a      origins of adult disease.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28724","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Wheat is the most important arable crop grown in the UK, with nearly 2\u000a      million hectares under cultivation each year. The value of the wheat\u000a      harvest to the UK economy is over &#163;1.6 billion. Successful plant breeding\u000a      and improved crop management has increased the average yield of wheat in\u000a      the UK from c. 2 tonnes ha-1 in 1940s to 8 tonnes ha-1 in\u000a      2012. However, this has resulted in crops being more `top heavy' and\u000a      susceptible to lodging (when the plant falls over either due to anchorage\u000a      failure, or the stem breaking). Plants that are initially resistant to\u000a      lodging may stand erect during favourable conditions but may fall down\u000a      when exceptionally bad weather, such as heavy rain or wind prevails, or in\u000a      wet ground. Plant growth regulators are used routinely to shorten the stem\u000a      of wheat, which reduces lodging risk but does not eliminate it.\u000a    The results of the first UoN seed rate project [a] identified the\u000a      optimum plant population for winter wheat and demonstrated a strong\u000a      relationship with sowing date (the later the sowing, the higher the\u000a      optimum plant population). This has been adopted by growers, leading to a\u000a      saving in input costs (seed) particularly for early sowings. The outcome\u000a      of the research on optimum plant population was first published by the\u000a      Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) in 2000, with revised recommendations\u000a      for growers regarding optimum plant populations. Continued work from UoN\u000a      informed the release of further guidelines within HGCA's Wheat Growth\u000a      Guide, published in 2008. (Source 1). In the new guide, target\u000a      plant populations for crops sown on given dates are provided and growers\u000a      are advised to only consider re-drilling wheat if fewer than 30 plants\u000a      ha-1 are established. Prior to this project, most growers sowed a `weight'\u000a      of seed &#8212; e.g. 180kg ha-1, but UoN demonstrated that, as seed\u000a      weight can vary two fold, the same weight of seed could mean twice as many\u000a      seeds in one year as the next. Now the majority of growers calculate their\u000a      `seed rate' in terms of number of seeds, rather than weight. HGCA provide\u000a      a seed rate calculator on their website to help growers with this\u000a      calculation (Source 2). The benefit to growers is through savings\u000a      in input cost and avoiding excessively large crops which are prone to\u000a      lodging (and hence have lower yields). It is impossible to quantify the\u000a      number of farms that make use of the research findings relating to optimum\u000a      plant populations, but for those that do, the financial savings would be\u000a      significant. Using figures from the Farm Business Survey (2010\/11) it is\u000a      calculated that if a grower was previously sowing 180 kg ha-1,\u000a      at &#163;400 t-1, this would cost &#163;72 ha-1. Moving to a\u000a      calculated seed rate of 150 seeds m-2 would cost &#163;27 ha-1,\u000a      at a thousand seed weight of 45g; a saving of &#163;45 ha-1. Exact\u000a      savings will be farm-specific as they depend on baseline seed rates and\u000a      the adopted seed strategy. Approximately 2 million hectares of wheat is\u000a      grown in the UK, so even if these changes were adopted on only 10% of the\u000a      area, this would equate to a saving of &#163;9 million per year to the\u000a      industry.\u000a    In a statement (2013), a farmer from Loughborough reported, 'Following\u000a        Nottingham\/ADAS research on seed rates, we have reduced our winter wheat\u000a        seed rates. Back in the late 90's our standard seed rate would have been\u000a        400 seeds per square metre, but now we start to sow around 10th\u000a        September at 225 seeds per square metre and then increase throughout the\u000a        sowing period to allow for poorer establishment. Decisions are taken on\u000a        a field by field basis. As on most local farms, our soil type is\u000a        variable within fields so we aim to vary seed rate according to soil\u000a        type within a field. We estimate that reducing seed rates in this way\u000a        leads to savings of &#163;28 per hectare for our business at current seed\u000a        prices\" (Source 3).\u000a    The lower plant populations are being actively used and winter wheat\u000a      crops are less likely to lodge, leading to greater returns for the grower.\u000a      The lodging model developed by Nottingham, led to greater understanding of\u000a      how growers can influence lodging risk through crop management and to new\u000a      guidelines for growers. These have since been updated and are actively\u000a      used by growers (Source 1). The lodging guidelines refer to a\u000a      number of HGCA project reports co-authored by Nottingham (Source 1).\u000a      An agronomist from Hurren Agronomy Limited stated (2013) that 'The\u000a        Nottingham\/ADAS work on canopy management and lodging has provided\u000a        greater understanding of how sowing date, seed rate and nitrogen\u000a        availability affect lodging risk within the wheat\" (Source 4).\u000a    BASIS is an independent organisation set up to establish and assess\u000a      standards in the pesticide industry relating to storage, transport and\u000a      competence of staff. The BASIS Certificate in Crop Protection is the\u000a      `Certificate to Practice' for agronomists making pesticide recommendations\u000a      on farm. The lodging guidelines are also studied by those whilst working\u000a      towards the BASIS Certificate in Crop Protection, which is an essential\u000a      award for anyone giving advice to growers on crop management practices.\u000a      The impact of the research found in the HGCA guidelines document was\u000a      summarised by a BASIS trainer who stated, 'The HGCA document (2008)\u000a      is a publication I find very useful, both on the BASIS Certificate in\u000a        Crop Protection and Advanced BASIS Cereals courses. It helps to increase\u000a        students' understanding of the causes of lodging, integrated lodging\u000a        control, lodging risk assessment and the role of plant growth regulators\"\u000a      (Source 5).\u000a    Since UoN began this programme of research and dissemination to farmers\u000a      the frequency of severe lodging events has reduced. This is due to\u000a      improved understanding of the factors affecting lodging elucidated by this\u000a      research and the guidelines available on how to reduce the incidence of\u000a      lodging. For example, avoiding early applications of nitrogen fertiliser\u000a      to maximise stem strength and reducing plant population to increase\u000a      anchorage strength. This has resulted in significant savings through\u000a      avoiding losses of yield and quality caused by lodging (especially in\u000a      light of increased wheat price and drying costs). Through avoiding those\u000a      losses in yield and quality, food processors benefit by being able to\u000a      source high quality grain that is suitable for their products and\u000a      consumers benefit from price stability. In 2013, the Principal Research\u000a      Scientist at ADAS (the UK's leading expert on lodging) confirmed the\u000a      benefits of following the guidelines. \"Between 1980 and the early 2000s\u000a        the average frequency of severe lodging years in the UK was\u000a        approximately one in year in four. Severe lodging years often coincided\u000a        with growing seasons with rapid autumn growth and wet summers. The\u000a        2011\/12 season was typified by a very mild autumn (hence rapid growth)\u000a        and the wettest summer for 100 years. Despite the very favourable\u000a        conditions for lodging there was in fact only a moderate amount of\u000a        lodging in cereals during this season. A large part of this good lodging\u000a        control is likely to be caused by good management of lodging risk\u000a        through the use of low seed rates, delaying N fertiliser to forward\u000a        crops and targeting robust PGR programmes to the crops with the greatest\u000a        lodging risk. This better understanding about how to manage lodging risk\u000a        has been developed by research at the University of Nottingham, ADAS UK\u000a        Ltd and the University of Birmingham' (Source 6).\u000a    The reach of the UoN research into lodging is currently being extended\u000a      internationally. Uptake of the Nottingham work by Australia's national\u000a      science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\u000a      Organisation (CSIRO) has been informing research direction and assisting\u000a      in grower extension activities. The Grains Research and Development\u000a      Corporation (GRDC) is a statutory corporation reporting to the Australian\u000a      Government Department for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. GDRC\u000a      delivers improvements in production, sustainability and profitability\u000a      across the Australian grains industry. A research agronomist who has been\u000a      leading GRDC funded projects since 2008 to improve the yield of irrigated\u000a      wheat in north-eastern Australia stated, \"The work of Debbie Sparkes\u000a        and her colleagues at The University of Nottingham has been invaluable\u000a        in understanding the causes of lodging, and helping us to improve\u000a        agronomic methods to control lodging while achieving high yields. A\u000a        grower recently used some of these improved techniques to achieve 8.2 t\u000a        ha-1, which we believe is a record wheat yield\u000a        for the State of Queensland\" (Source 7, 2013).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Nottingham (UoN) research into optimum plant populations\u000a      and lodging in wheat has led to advances in agronomic practices for winter\u000a      wheat in the UK, in particular changes in the way that seed rates are\u000a      calculated (by number, rather than weight) to establish optimum plant\u000a      populations.

In wheat, loss of productivity due to lodging is through a\u000a      combination of reduction in yield, reduction in grain quality, increased\u000a      drying costs and delayed harvest [1]. Yield reductions of up to\u000a      80% have been recorded in wheat with an average loss of 2.5 t ha-1[1].\u000a      At the start of this research programme, it was estimated that severe\u000a      lodging occurred approximately once every four years with costs incurred\u000a      to UK wheat growers of approximately &#163;130 million (50% attributable to\u000a      losses in yield and quality and 50% resulting from increased drying and\u000a      cleaning costs [1]). The price of wheat has increased markedly in\u000a      recent years (from &#163;80\/tonne to &#163;200\/tonne) so potential economic losses\u000a      associated with lodging are now much larger.\u000a    In response to this problem, UoN researchers carried out four\u000a      interrelated research projects (three supported by HGCA, one by BBSRC) [a-d]\u000a      with the aim of improving management of winter wheat in the UK. All\u000a      projects were in collaboration with the agricultural and environmental\u000a      consultancy ADAS, which has a network of experimental sites across the\u000a      country, hence providing an excellent resource for field experiments. The\u000a      first project on plant population in winter wheat [b] aimed to\u000a      understand the response of wheat to changes in plant density and to\u000a      identify optimum plant populations for winter wheat sown on different\u000a      dates. The second project [d] expanded this work to consider the\u000a      impact of latitude and nitrogen application on optimum plant density.\u000a    The initial lodging project [a], a collaboration between UoN and\u000a      ADAS, aimed to understand which crops were most prone to lodging and how\u000a      this could be avoided through crop management (plant population, nitrogen\u000a      application and sowing date). This led to greater understanding of crop\u000a      characteristics that determined lodging risk and to the development of a\u000a      model to predict the wind speed at which lodging would occur, based on\u000a      these crop characteristics. The second lodging project [c] was\u000a      funded by BBSRC to validate and further improve the lodging model. ADAS\u000a      were again key collaborators on this project, along with Professor Chris\u000a      Baker (who had moved to University of Birmingham from UoN in 1998).\u000a    Key research findings were:\u000a    \u000a      Through detailed monitoring of crop growth and development (shoot\u000a        production, light interception, biomass production and yield formation),\u000a        the physiological response of wheat to plant population density and how\u000a        this is affected by sowing date, was elucidated [2,3].\u000a      Data from field experiments was combined with input costs (seed) and\u000a        output prices (grain) to identify optimum plant population densities for\u000a        wheat sown on a given date [3].\u000a      Through collaboration with civil engineers, a model was produced which\u000a        identified key crop characteristics that determine the risk of lodging.\u000a        These were classified as leverage traits: centre of gravity,\u000a        natural frequency, number of shoots per plant; stem strength traits:\u000a        stem diameter, stem wall width, breaking strength; and anchorage\u000a          traits: root plate spread and root plate depth [1]. This\u000a        model was then calibrated against measurements from field experiments [4].\u000a      The impact of crop management on lodging risk was elucidated using the\u000a        model. For example, high plant population leads to a small root plate\u000a        spread and hence reduced anchorage strength, thereby increasing lodging\u000a        risk (reducing stem failure wind speed) [5].\u000a    \u000a    The UoN projects led to a greater understanding of the factors affecting\u000a      lodging and provided the basis recommendations for growers in how to\u000a      prevent it happening.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28725","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    UK agriculture is characterised by a large number of independent\u000a      businesses with individual management decisions and actions impacting upon\u000a      their physical and financial performance. As noted in section 2, research\u000a      at UoN has examined potato, cereal, dairy and whole farm performance with\u000a      outputs published in peer-reviewed journals, plus reports and\u000a      presentations to Government. This efficiency and business performance\u000a      research has identified the importance and influence of business\u000a      management practices on resource use and profitability. Assisting the\u000a      agricultural industry to improve resource use efficiency through enhanced\u000a      business management practices is now encapsulated within the FBS research\u000a      programme, led by UoN (PI 2004 onwards). A major output of the annual FBS\u000a      research programme is the free-to-use on-line farm business benchmarking\u000a      service (Source 1). This tool draws on independently collected and\u000a      analysed contemporary data from the FBS across England. In 2010 this\u000a      on-line data tool was substantially and significantly enhanced by the\u000a      Nottingham-led FBS research consortium. This facilitated user interface\u000a      interactions and encompassed UK and EU benchmarking options in addition to\u000a      offering different levels of \"ease of access\" to users wishing to access\u000a      data at varying levels of analytical detail. As shown in Figure 1, the\u000a      uptake of the tool, as assessed by web visits, has increased substantially\u000a      since 2008. The tool allows users (farmers, consultants) to benchmark\u000a      their own business and enterprise performance against industry `average'\u000a      and `high' performers. This commitment to improve the fortunes of\u000a      agriculture has been welcomed by the British Institute of Agricultural\u000a      Consultants (BIAC): \"Relevant `benchmarking' provides the basis for\u000a        sound decision making and BIAC, who represent the views of independent\u000a        consultants throughout the UK, sees the Farm Business Benchmarking\u000a        Online as another tool for this work\" (Source 2).\u000a\u0009  \u000a\u0009  Figure 1.

Moreover, the on-line tool is\u000a      additionally publicised via hard copy information publications, by email\u000a      alerts direct to the site (Source 1), via links on Government\u000a      websites (Source 4) and search engines. Web counter records\u000a      demonstrate growing usage of the FBS Business Benchmarking tool (Figure 1)\u000a      since 2008, flowing from enhanced user-interface of the on-line tool and\u000a      the outreach activities promoting the use of FBS Farm Business\u000a      Benchmarking.\u000a    Evidence from Defra's Farm Business Survey (FBS) (Source 1)\u000a      indicates a large variation in the physical and financial performance\u000a      achieved by individual farm businesses. Moreover, while average\u000a      performance differs between farm types, variation across individual\u000a      businesses within particular farm types is substantial (Defra, 2011a) (Source\u000a        5). Hence, whilst some farm businesses achieve considerable economic\u000a      profits, others accrue large financial losses. Specifically, variation in\u000a      managerial factors accounts for a substantial proportion of variation in\u000a      business performance (Defra report, 2011b) (Source 6): Farmers who\u000a      undertake benchmarking achieve greater business results; Source 7\u000a      (Defra report, 2012) notes \"those using benchmarking had significantly\u000a        higher farm business performance\". Agricultural business\u000a      benchmarking has developed over the last 15 years to become an important\u000a      component of successful agricultural business management. Defined by\u000a      Seabrook (Nottingham, 1972-2006), business benchmarking comprises of\u000a      measurement, comparison, identification, analysis and implementation. For\u000a      individual farmers, using the benchmarking tool leads to identification of\u000a      issues which require further investigation and business adaptation; for\u000a      example, FBS Benchmarking has led to major business improvements,\u000a      summarised by one farmer as: \"[Because of Benchmarking] I have gone\u000a        into close collaboration with a neighbour in machinery optimisation.\u000a        This has made a big difference to our accounts. The survey results have\u000a        given us tenants and the landlord the confidence that we're doing a good\u000a        job\" (Source 8).\u000a    While other benchmarking services exist in the UK agricultural sector,\u000a      the FBS Business Benchmarking service represents the only free-to-use,\u000a      non-(data) commitment service which offers both whole-farm and enterprise\u000a      analysis alongside UK and EU Benchmarking options across 27 EU member\u000a      states, providing both national and international business\u000a      benchmarking; users from the UK, continental Europe, USA and Australasia\u000a      have accessed this service. FBS data (2011\/12) demonstrates that 15% of\u000a      English farmers \"frequently undertake whole farm level business\u000a      benchmarking\" achieving an average (FBI) of &#163;128,900, which is\u000a      statistically significantly greater than the average &#163;63,000 FBI for farm\u000a      businesses that do not benchmark. Nationally (England) the 15% of 60,000\u000a      farm businesses which benchmark therefore achieve an aggregate FBI &#163;592m\u000a      greater than they would accrue if they achieved an FBI in line with those\u000a      that do not benchmark. FBS Farm Business Benchmarking represents one of\u000a      the main industry benchmarking tools in contemporary use.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research from the University Nottingham (UoN) has identified the\u000a      importance of agricultural business management in improving business\u000a      performance.

Fera is responsible, on behalf of Defra, for implementing\u000d\u000a      the plant health regulations in England and Wales and is a key player in\u000d\u000a      the UK working with other EC Member States and the European Commission to\u000d\u000a      agree appropriate plant health rules for Europe and co-ordinate their\u000d\u000a      implementation.\u000d\u000a    Work at UoN on developing improved plant pathogen diagnostics was\u000d\u000a      initiated in 2005 through a Defra Plant Health Fellowship (see\u000d\u000a      corroborating Source 5 for details of the objectives and outcomes\u000d\u000a      of this fellowship). The key benefits of this fellowship (apart from\u000d\u000a      training a scientist with expertise in molecular diagnostics who is now\u000d\u000a      employed at Fera) were the development and validation of real-time PCR\u000d\u000a      diagnostics for phytoplasma diseases, which were recognised by Defra as a\u000d\u000a      potential threat to UK agriculture because of their prevalence on crops\u000d\u000a      such as apples, pears, tree species and numerous ornamentals throughout\u000d\u000a      Europe. Currently these diseases are rare in the UK, so the aim was to\u000d\u000a      develop protocols that could be used to test imported materials and\u000d\u000a      prevent entry of these pathogens. This protocol is now used routinely by\u000d\u000a      Fera for testing suspected phytoplasma infected material and is provided\u000d\u000a      as part of their statutory testing (Source 1). In addition, the\u000d\u000a      technology has been incorporated into the accredited phytoplasma testing\u000d\u000a      diagnostic service offered by the Swiss-based Agro-Diagnostics Company,\u000d\u000a      Bioreba (Source 2). This commercial service has been used already\u000d\u000a      on hundreds of samples (mainly from fruit trees) for customers in\u000d\u000a      Switzerland and Europe. Prof. Dickinson has subsequently developed\u000d\u000a      specific real-time PCR based assays for detection of a broad range of\u000d\u000a      potato and cereal viruses, including potato virus S, potato virus M,\u000d\u000a      arracacha virus B, potato black ringspot virus, barley yellow dwarf virus\u000d\u000a      variants, cocksfoot mottle virus, cocksfoot streak virus, cynosurus mottle\u000d\u000a      virus, oat chlorotic stunt virus, ryegrass mosaic virus, soil borne wheat\u000d\u000a      mosaic virus and wheat spindle streak mosaic virus (Sources 1, 6).\u000d\u000a      These assays have been incorporated into the diagnostic protocols used by\u000d\u000a      Fera as part of their statutory duties. The overall financial value of\u000d\u000a      these diagnostic services is difficult to quantify since they are being\u000d\u000a      implemented principally as preventative measures (as quarantine \/ early\u000d\u000a      detection systems), but should these phytoplasma and viral diseases become\u000d\u000a      endemic in UK fruit trees, potato and cereal crops, the annual losses are\u000d\u000a      likely to be in the order of millions of pounds. The social and\u000d\u000a      environmental impacts associated with a failure of plant health protection\u000d\u000a      strategies would also be significant.\u000d\u000a    The second aspect of this work was development of nucleic-acid based\u000d\u000a      detection systems for `in-field' or `point-of-care' testing, and this work\u000d\u000a      has been undertaken in a number of countries, including the UK, Ghana and\u000d\u000a      Ethiopia, and has been published in international peer-reviewed journals.\u000d\u000a      Previous methods for in-field testing have generally been antibody-based\u000d\u000a      (i.e. use of lateral-flow devices), but there are many pathogens for which\u000d\u000a      it has been impossible to develop the necessary specificity or sensitivity\u000d\u000a      in such tests. UoN research developed the DNA-based technique of LAMP for\u000d\u000a      detection of a range of pathogens (Sources 1-4, 7). This was a\u000d\u000a      collaboration between UoN, Fera, CSIR Ghana and the company Optigene, UK,\u000d\u000a      who, following discussions with UoN in 2009, have developed and are now\u000d\u000a      marketing a small battery operated portable real-time LAMP product\u000d\u000a      detection machine, the Genie II (http:\/\/optigene.co.uk\/)\u000d\u000a      (Source 4). UoN piloted use of this machine in Ghana, where the\u000d\u000a      machine is now being routinely used for field detection of phytoplasma\u000d\u000a      diseases in coconut (Sources 3, 7). These diseases have devastated\u000d\u000a      plantations in much of Africa resulting in 100% losses in many areas and\u000d\u000a      severe economic hardships in communities where coconut is the main source\u000d\u000a      of livelihood for several disadvantaged groups (e.g. women and landless\u000d\u000a      poor). In a statement (2013) the Director of CSIR Oil Palm Research-Ghana\u000d\u000a      said 'The most significant advantage of using LAMP assays by the\u000d\u000a        coconut research team in Ghana is the ability to use the method\u000d\u000a        in-field. The machine can be run on a rechargeable battery, is portable\u000d\u000a        and therefore easy to carry to field location in very remote areas. Our\u000d\u000a        staff are now able to provide diagnostic services to farmers in\u000d\u000a        different parts of the country using the Genie II. The whole process of\u000d\u000a        DNA extraction to sample analysis is done within 30 minutes and this is\u000d\u000a        enhancing the speed and amount of work that is done on field visits. The\u000d\u000a        LAMP assays are thus revolutionising diagnosis of lethal disease in\u000d\u000a        Ghana and helping us to do so much more than we could do with the\u000d\u000a        traditional methods\" (Source 3).\u000d\u000a    In the UK, Fera is piloting the use of these real-time LAMP machines by\u000d\u000a      their field inspectors and for detection of diseases such as sudden oak\u000d\u000a      death. Optigene are also marketing the machine to the Animal Health and\u000d\u000a      Vet Labs Agency (AHVLA) and overseas. Continuing work is now aimed at\u000d\u000a      commercialising diagnostic kits, and licensing agreements are being agreed\u000d\u000a      between Optigene and Eiken in Japan for `plant health' diagnostic rights (Source\u000a        4). Because of the worldwide distribution of the pathogens for which\u000d\u000a      diagnostic tests have been developed, UoN research is of major\u000d\u000a      significance in the UK, continental Europe and the rest of the world.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Diseases of plants impact upon global food production and the\u000d\u000a      environment, necessitating careful control.

New phytoplasma diseases are constantly emerging in\u000d\u000a      new hosts and at new locations, and in 2005, Defra perceived that these\u000d\u000a      quarantine organisms were becoming an increasing threat to UK agriculture\u000d\u000a      due to climate change and the increased import of plant material from\u000d\u000a      countries where such diseases are endemic. As a result, they funded a\u000d\u000a      Defra Plant Health Fellowship in 2005 at UoN in collaboration with Rick\u000d\u000a      Mumford and Neil Boonham (Fera), with the aim of training a diagnostician\u000d\u000a      in phytoplasma diseases [a].

In the dairy industry,\u000a      reproductive performance is measured only once per year, the generation\u000a      interval is 5 years and cows stay in the herd for up to 10 years.\u000a      Nevertheless, the latest statistics indicate that fertility is improving,\u000a      both genetically and phenotypically, and will continue to improve for\u000a      generations to come.\u000a    Bull proofs for fertility were first made available to the breeding\u000a      companies involved in the project in December 2003. Although originally\u000a      made publicly available through the Milk Development Council website in\u000a      2005, the Fertility Index has become firmly established and increasingly\u000a      important in the 2008-2013 period (Sources 1-3). The Index\u000a      provided producers, for the first time, with the facility to select bulls\u000a      on the basis of daughter fertility. The production of the Fertility Index\u000a      is managed through DairyCo (DairyCo is the levy board which utilises dairy\u000a      farmer levy payments in Great Britain), with a spin-out company based at\u000a      Scottish Rural College (eGenes) established to collect and analyse the\u000a      relevant data from the industry.\u000a    Analysis of national artificial insemination records shows fertility\u000a      trends in bulls and cows (Figure 1; Source 1). Genetic merit of AI\u000a      bulls for calving interval flattened off after release of the Index to\u000a      breeding companies, indicating an early effect upon fertility trends. When\u000a      farmers started using the Fertility Index to select bulls, the fertility\u000a      trend was reversed. The rate of reduction from 2008 to 2012 was 20% faster\u000a      than the rate of increase from 1990 to 2000, showing an accelerated rate\u000a      of improvement in fertility. In cows there was a slowing in the rate of\u000a      increase genetic merit for calving interval and a reversal from 2008\u000a      onwards, showing that choices of bulls were feeding through into their\u000a      daughters' performance. Daughter performance is reported by year of birth;\u000a      hence the latest data are for cows born in 2010.\u000a \u000a\u0009  Figure 1: The increasing Calving Interval from 1990-2007\u000a        indicates declining fertility. The Fertility Index and use of new\u000a        dietary formulations has contributed to the rapid improvement in calving\u000a        interval since 2008.\u000a\u0009  \u000a    The Fertility Index has become firmly incorporated into international\u000a      genetic evaluations through Interbull (a subcommittee of the International\u000a      Committee for Animal Recording) (Source 1) - see Interbull (2012)\u000a      (Source 2). It is also widely used by international breeding\u000a      companies to promote superior bulls (e.g. WorldWide Sires [Source 3]).\u000a    The main deliverable of the UoN nutritional research was a new way of\u000a      thinking when evaluating dairy cow nutrition in relation to milk yield and\u000a      fertility - the industry now considers not only nutrient supply, but also\u000a      the effect of diet on metabolic hormones, and their influence on the\u000a      reproductive system. The three commercial partners in UoN LINK programmes\u000a      (LK0646 [e]) are well known for their innovative approaches to\u000a      dairy cow nutrition. BOCM PAULS is market leader in UK dairy compound\u000a      feed; AB Agri is the leading UK supplier of blended feeds for dairy\u000a      cattle; Provimi is a world leader in animal nutrition with plants in 27\u000a      countries. BOCM PAULS and Provimi incorporated UoN predictive equations\u000a      into their ration formulation programmes to provide nutritional indexes\u000a      for insulin and progesterone as aids to fertility.\u000a    The Head of Ruminant Development at BOCM PAULS stated: \"Our goal is\u000a        to improve fertility and longevity by focusing on extending the\u000a        productive life of the cow and reducing the costs associated with\u000a        infertility and high replacement rates. The Nottingham fertility\u000a        research provides a central feature of our approach, by predicting the\u000a        likely influence of nutrition on metabolic hormones, particularly\u000a        insulin, and consequences for fertility. To this end, we incorporated\u000a        fertility indexes for insulin and progesterone into our ration\u000a        formulation packages. Every dairy cow ration that we have designed since\u000a        2008 incorporates an assessment of potential effects on fertility. Using\u000a        this approach, we have seen significant improvements in fertility on\u000a        many dairy farms. In 2012, BOCM PAULS became part of the ForFarmers\u000a        Group, the largest feed company in Europe with a turnover of &#8364; 6.6\u000a        billion. As part of the integration process, we have shared technical\u000a        information and ideas with partner companies in the Group. Thus, the\u000a        concepts generated by the Nottingham fertility research are being\u000a        implemented in dairy nutrition programmes throughout Northern Europe\"\u000a      (Source 4). Feed companies not associated with the project have\u000a      also incorporated concepts generated by UoN into marketing material, e.g.\u000a      Volac (Source 5). The findings are incorporated into advice to\u000a      farmers from DairyCo on feeding for fertility (Source 6).\u000a    Data confirm that practical application of genetic, nutritional and\u000a      management tools reversed the decline in fertility among cows. Between\u000a      2000 and 2008, average calving interval of UK Holstein cows increased\u000a      at the rate of 4 days per year; between 2009 and 2010, the interval decreased\u000a      by 4 days (Source 7). This rapid trend reversal is highly\u000a      significant. If maintained, rate of restoration of fertility will be 5\u000a      times the rate of genetic progress. As the genetic gain in fertility\u000a      occurs year on year, it is therefore cumulative over time.\u000a    In 2012 DairyCo estimated that the typical UK herd was losing\u000a      &#163;250\/cow\/year through poor fertility. A shorter calving interval would\u000a      save &#163;2\/cow per day of interval reduction. On this basis the savings\u000a      associated with improving fertility amounted to &#163;16m nationally in\u000a      2009-2010. Genetic trends suggest that improvement will continue so, by\u000a      2020, annual savings will approach &#163;100m. Approximately half of this can\u000a      be attributed to the Fertility Index and half to better nutrition and\u000a      management (Source 8).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Fertility of dairy cows has been in decline since the 1970's and this has\u000a      threatened sustainability of the dairy industry worldwide.

Coffey).\u000a    Nottingham has a long history of world-leading research in bovine\u000a      reproduction and pioneered the use of milk progesterone to monitor\u000a      fertility of dairy cows. By comparing progesterone data in the 1990s and\u000a      1970s [a] UoN revealed a significant decline in fertility among UK\u000a      dairy cows, which was negatively associated with genetic merit for milk\u000a      yield [1]. Similar trends have since been identified in most\u000a      countries with well-developed dairy industries. Cows exhibited delayed\u000a      ovulation and conception rate was declining by 1% per annum. Poor\u000a      fertility was estimated to cost the UK dairy industry &#163;350 million per\u000a      annum, mostly through premature culling of healthy cows that failed to\u000a      conceive. With strategic funding from Defra and industry, a collaborative\u000a      research programme, led by Nottingham, was started in 2000 to find ways to\u000a      restore fertility through genetics and nutrition, the two main drivers of\u000a      poor fertility.\u000a    In the genetic work [b], UoN established genetic characteristics\u000a      of dairy cow fertility traits derived from milk progesterone data, which\u000a      were combined with heritability of management measures of fertility\u000a      obtained at SAC [1]. In a Nottingham-led follow-up programme [c]\u000a      approximately 1.4 million daughter records from 18,000 sires were used to\u000a      generate a Fertility Index for bulls. The Index was based on daughters'\u000a      calving interval, insemination data, pregnancy rate, milk yield and body\u000a      condition score. An Index value was calculated for each bull so that bulls\u000a      could be ranked for selection purposes [2].\u000a    In the nutrition work [d-g], it was noted that, cows with high\u000a      genetic merit for milk yield had lower plasma insulin concentrations than\u000a      average cows and hypothesised that nutritional manipulation of insulin\u000a      might enhance fertility. A pilot study demonstrated that, a diet that\u000a      stimulated insulin secretion increased the proportion of cows ovulating in\u000a      the first 50 days postpartum [3]. In subsequent studies with 23\u000a      dietary treatments, equations were developed to predict effects of\u000a      nutrition on insulin and fertility [4]. Parallel studies explored\u000a      physiological mechanisms at the ovarian and systemic levels to explain\u000a      whole-animal responses. The novel observation was made that although diets\u000a      that induced higher insulin concentrations stimulated ovarian follicles [4],\u000a      high insulin was detrimental to oocyte quality [5]. A key insight\u000a      was that reproductive performance of dairy cows might be improved by\u000a      differential nutrition at different phases of the reproductive cycle. It\u000a      was demonstrated that feeding a diet designed to stimulate insulin during\u000a      the early postpartum period and then a diet designed to lower insulin\u000a      during the mating period increased the proportion of cows pregnant at 120\u000a      days of lactation from 27% in control treatments to 60% in the optimum\u000a      treatment. Crucially, fertility was improved without compromising milk\u000a      yield or cow health [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28728","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The use of thickening agents in packaged food materials is widespread and\u000a      as the global market for pre-packaged foodstuffs is worth in excess of\u000a      US$3 trillion, developments in thickening technology are of considerable\u000a      economic benefit to manufacturers and processors.

This research has been\u000a      enabled by the close partnerships that the University has with the\u000a      industry.\u000a    Hydraxan\u000a    As a result of the recognised expertise of the Food Science group at the\u000a      University of Nottingham, CSM supported three research projects to a value\u000a      of &#163;500k over the period 2002-2004 with a focus on optimum delivery of\u000a      functional ingredients. UoN had a long-established interest in developing\u000a      a new class of food additives\/ingredients using expertise on extrusion and\u000a      hydrocolloids and this led to the development of Hydraxan. Production\u000a      trials with Dupont (a major ingredient manufacturer) held in 2008, were\u000a      successful. In a statement, the Senior Principal Scientist, Hydrocolloids\u000a      Science at Dupont stated that 'In 2008 Danisco (now DuPont) entered\u000a        into an agreement with Nottingham University to evaluate proprietary\u000a        technology relating to a novel formulation of Xanthan gum, cf. the\u000a        patent application which is jointly owned by the University\u000a        WO\/2006\/065136 regarding 'Water-Dispersible Xanthan Gum Containing\u000a        Composition\". The objectives of the trials were to demonstrate that the\u000a        novel readily dispersible xanthan could be made from DuPont xanthan, to\u000a        see if the process could be scaled up and to provide kg quantities of\u000a        the material for further application trials. These objectives were met\u000a        in full\" (Source 1).\u000a    Work to scale up production has been a key focus of work with Hydraxan in\u000a      the commercial sector. The patent was granted in 2010 in several\u000a      countries, including the UK, and on 9th October 2012 was\u000a      exclusively licenced to Biopolymer Solutions Ltd, an East Midlands SME.\u000a      The technology has been given a boost as a result of further recent DEFRA\u000a      LINK funding \"Development of physically modified hydrocolloids for\u000a      enhanced taste perception\" (start date March 2012) and work is currently\u000a      being carried out by CP Kelco, a US company with major expertise on\u000a      xanthan. In a statement (2013), the Distinguished Research Fellow of CP\u000a      Kelco said \"Over the last six months we have collaborated with the\u000a        staff at the University of Nottingham to understand Hydraxan; a new form\u000a        of xanthan developed by the University. CP Kelco intends to collaborate\u000a        with the University of Nottingham and the French company Clextral for a\u000a        large scale trial in early 2013. This trial is intended to provide a 100\u000a        Kg or larger sample of Hydraxan for commercial trials. The Hydraxan\u000a        process developed at the University is intended to provide a different\u000a        texture as compared to the unprocessed xanthan gum. Our work with\u000a        rheological properties and optical microscopy indicates that a Hydraxan\u000a        solution is composed of varying amounts of molecularly dispersed polymer\u000a        along with another phase of swollen but still associated particles or\u000a        soft bits of gel. Compared to other composites, Hydraxan is unique since\u000a        the composite is formed of a single material; some of the thickening\u000a        comes from molecularly dispersed xanthan and some comes from highly\u000a        swollen small particles\" (Source 2). Further process scale\u000a      up work with Clextral (a major extruder manufacturer) (Source 3)\u000a      to levels of 50kg\/hr was successfully completed in January 2013. 250kg of\u000a      xanthan was processed showing that the structural transformation\u000a      discovered by the University had occurred in the process and that product\u000a      structures can be tuned by varying the process conditions. Work on\u000a      performance in sauces is being driven by Dovedale Foods, another East\u000a      Midlands SME, who are streamlining production processes, making high\u000a      quality production accessible to the SME community (SMEs make up 90% of\u000a      the UK food manufacturing sector).\u000a    Although the use of Hydraxan is at an early stage the food industry\u000a      considers it to have major potential in both human and animal foods. A\u000a      statement from the Physical Chemistry and Gels Manager at Mars Petcare\u000a      confirmed that \"There are a number of factors that inhibit higher usage\u000a        of unmodified xanthan in our processes and products. This modified raw\u000a        material would help significantly to overcome those issues and that is\u000a        why we are interested to pursue it further\" (Source 4).\u000a    Thixate\u000a    The catalyst for the development of Thixate was a request by Reckitt\u000a      Benckiser (a pharmaceutical\/healthcare company) to use UoN expertise on\u000a      hydrocolloids to understand an observation of the unusual behaviour of\u000a      xanthan in a major product system (underpinning research project f).\u000a      While the initial work [C] has not yet been exploited the patented\u000a      opportunity would have value in over the counter markets worth $33bn. The\u000a      initial work was extended to the very important and novel area of\u000a      xanthan-particulate blends &#8212; termed `Thixate'. It has been possible to\u000a      integrate the two innovations by blending the \"current\" molecular xanthan\u000a      with the novel particulate form prepared by the extrusion process. Patents\u000a      have been filed by UoN on the work and in-product studies are currently\u000a      being undertaken by Eminate (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the University\u000a      of Nottingham). This collaboration has led to a third patent being filed\u000a      and negotiations are underway for uptake by Dupont (Source 1). In\u000a      a statement (2013), the Managing Director of Eminate stated \"Over the\u000a        last 24 months, Eminate has been working with Dr Tim Foster at the\u000a        University of Nottingham to develop one of his patents (related to\u000a        xanthan) into a commercial product. Building on the underpinning\u000a        research work completed by Dr Foster and his research group on the\u000a        fundamental science, the Eminate-led team has now developed a series of\u000a        prototypes in a product range under the brand name Thixate. This range\u000a        is a series of foods and drinks which contain the Thixate ingredient as\u000a        described in the patent and have been shown to provide consumers with a\u000a        feeling of satiety and reduced calorie intake at the next meal\" (Source\u000a        5). Additional opportunities expanding the thixate technology into\u000a      controlled release of nutrients and drugs have been identified, which\u000a      product range is one of the core components of Eminate's commercial\u000a      strategy, providing \"commercially-viable, innovative ingredients for\u000a        health\" (Sources 5,6). The Thixate technology will be\u000a      applied to use of concentrates for distributed manufacture of food, closer\u000a      to the consumer; to cut down on waste and decrease distribution costs of\u000a      foods containing high volumes of water.

Xanthan gum is an important food\u000a      hydrocolloid thickener, which was approved for use in food in the US in\u000a      1969 and the EU in 1982. The current annual market for xanthan gum is\u000a      estimated to be US$900M, split approximately equally between food and\u000a      non-food use. This hydrocolloid is unique as its molecular solutions show\u000a      weak gel properties, providing both suspension and flow behaviour e.g.\u000a      allowing the suspension of herbs in a vinaigrette salad dressing. However,\u000a      currently used grades of xanthan disperse poorly in water, a problem that\u000a      the industry has battled with since the material was first commercialised.\u000a      This prevents use of xanthan at high concentrations. Work at UoN has\u000a      addressed two important problems that are associated with the use of\u000a      xanthan gums.\u000a    Using extrusion technology UoN and CSM (a major manufacturer of baked\u000a      products)-sponsored projects [c] showed the production of a\u000a      physically modified xanthan [A] that is easily handled and readily\u000a      dispersible. The physical modification aids the dispersion of the xanthan,\u000a      but does not convert the parent hydrocolloid, as subsequent heating and\u000a      cooling converts the dispersion to a solution matching the physical\u000a      properties (viscosity and coil-helix transition temperature) of a control\u000a      material [1].\u000a    Increasing viscosity with the xanthan gums currently used by the food\u000a      industry reduces the sensory perception of taste, requiring addition of\u000a      higher amounts of salt or sugar to compensate. Salt reduction is an\u000a      important target for many food producers and the use of extruded xanthan\u000a      enables an improved tastant delivery, allowing reduced formulation levels.\u000a      In work sponsored by Nestle and DEFRA [a] food scientists at UoN\u000a      demonstrated that if food is thickened by swollen particles rather than a\u000a      solution of a biopolymer flavour\/taste delivery is retained at high\u000a      viscosities [2]. A new extruded xanthan developed by UoN converts\u000a      the polymeric macromolecule into a particulate form [1], which\u000a      gives a product microstructure with improved salt release. Starch (energy\u000a      density) reduction is also a growing requirement for industry to combat\u000a      obesity and type-2 diabetes. The new extruded xanthan has functional\u000a      properties on cooking performance (thickening on heating) and in-mouth\u000a      dispersibility for mouthfeel and taste delivery [a &amp; d],\u000a      allowing starch replacement. The processing of food biopolymers can be\u000a      understood using principles that are well-established for synthetic\u000a      polymers. The research, together with the above mentioned grants and the\u000a      EU funded STEP-ITN programme [e], has created an understanding of\u000a      control of amorphous-crystalline transitions [3]. This has led to\u000a      the development of a new form of xanthan, produced by a novel structural\u000a      rearrangement of the native helical linkages using melt extrusion cooking,\u000a      a processing technology first developed for synthetic polymers (product\u000a      name `Hydraxan').\u000a    A second industry problem, which spans food and pharmaceutical\u000a      industries, is that upon dilution (by bodily fluids during mastication and\u000a      digestion) structures tend to lose texture and viscosity. In projects\u000a      funded by Reckitt Benckiser a second invention [B,C] converted\u000a      xanthan gum to a liquid crystalline form [4 &amp; 5]. This\u000a      thickens upon dilution as the xanthan concentration decreases [6].\u000a      Subsequent work involving a clinical trial, showed that this product\u000a      (Thixate) suppressed appetite following consumption in a test meal. This\u000a      led to a UK patent filing for Thixate as a satiety gel [D].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28729","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Bovine mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary gland following bacterial\u000d\u000a      invasion, is the\u000d\u000a      foremost endemic infectious disease of dairy cattle worldwide.

The control plan produces a\u000d\u000a      hierarchical ranking of possible\u000d\u000a      farm interventions, and places them in order of likely efficacy, dependent\u000d\u000a      on the farm's mastitis\u000d\u000a      pattern. The DairyCo Mastitis Control Plan encompasses the entire process;\u000d\u000a      from farm diagnosis,\u000d\u000a      to identification of the best control measures, to implementation of the\u000d\u000a      measures on farm &#8212; all\u000d\u000a      based on the research detailed in this statement. For example, control\u000d\u000a      measures could include\u000d\u000a      making alterations to the cow's environment, changing the milking\u000d\u000a      procedure or changing dry cow\u000d\u000a      nutrition. The control plan incorporates all aspects known to influence\u000d\u000a      the risk of mastitis but\u000d\u000a      uniquely does so in a way to identify the optimal control strategy for\u000d\u000a      each individual farm. Over two\u000d\u000a      hundred and fifty veterinary surgeons and consultants have been trained in\u000d\u000a      the application of the\u000d\u000a      control plan since 2009 (Source 2), and it continues to be\u000d\u000a      implemented in a coordinated way\u000d\u000a      throughout Great Britain (Sources 1 &amp; 2). The national acclaim\u000d\u000a      and media attention (Sources 3, 4,\u000d\u000a        5 &amp; 6) provides evidence of the scheme's widespread uptake and\u000d\u000a      influence.\u000d\u000a    Approximately 90% of the work to develop the scheme was conducted by\u000d\u000a      researchers at\u000d\u000a      Nottingham. UoN researchers provided the entire underpinning\u000d\u000a          information for the development\u000d\u000a      and implementation of the national mastitis control scheme, in terms of\u000d\u000a      its technical make up,\u000d\u000a      optimisation, execution and evaluation. The national scheme was designed\u000d\u000a      and tested in a\u000d\u000a      randomised controlled trial and this directly led to the scheme being\u000d\u000a      chosen and started by\u000d\u000a      DairyCo UK. The original control plan was honed prior to national launch,\u000d\u000a      through the subsequent\u000d\u000a      analytic research that introduced refinements. Bespoke software was\u000d\u000a      developed to translate the\u000d\u000a      research findings into a format appropriate for use on a national scale\u000d\u000a      (the DairyCo \"ePlan\"), and\u000d\u000a      this software was designed from the findings of the research described (Source\u000d\u000a        2).\u000d\u000a    Current analysis of farms in the mastitis control scheme (2009 - 2012)\u000d\u000a      indicates that a reduction in\u000d\u000a      clinical disease of between 10-20% per year is being achieved (Source\u000d\u000a        7) and this means that, in\u000d\u000a      the first three years of operation the scheme has provided multi million\u000d\u000a      pound savings to the dairy\u000d\u000a      industry (Sources 2 &amp; 7). The scheme has coverage across the\u000d\u000a      whole of Britain and is available to\u000d\u000a      all British dairy farms. The total population of cows in Britain is ~1.6\u000d\u000a      million and in the first three\u000d\u000a      years the scheme (2009-2012) was implemented on 980 farms containing\u000d\u000a      &gt;10% of the cow\u000d\u000a      population (Source 7). The economic value to the British dairy\u000d\u000a      industry from the improvements\u000d\u000a      made by these farms is &gt;&#163;3 million p.a. in terms of clinical disease\u000d\u000a      alone (Source 2) and &#163;5-10M\u000d\u000a      p.a. when subclinical disease is included (Source 7). There are\u000d\u000a      many beneficiaries of the scheme.\u000d\u000a      Dairy farmers benefit from reduced clinical and subclinical mastitis with\u000d\u000a      large financial gains,\u000d\u000a      improved cow welfare, reduced environmental imprint and improved\u000d\u000a      sustainability of milk\u000d\u000a      production. The wholesale and retail sector benefit from improved image\u000d\u000a      and value of milk\u000d\u000a      produced. The veterinary sector benefits from increased sustainability of\u000d\u000a      the practice model, with\u000d\u000a      increased focus on disease prevention rather than treatment.\u000d\u000a    The research and national control programme have had an international\u000d\u000a      impact by being\u000d\u000a      incorporated into other national disease policies and programmes. This\u000d\u000a      influence is evident in a\u000d\u000a      variety of countries, including the Netherlands (Prof Green presented the\u000d\u000a      research to key opinion\u000d\u000a      leaders in the Dutch National Udder Health Programme, in 2009 and 2011,\u000d\u000a      and also gave a\u000d\u000a      keynote presentation to the international conference on Udder Health and\u000d\u000a      Communication (Source\u000d\u000a        8), the USA (Source 9), Australia (Prof Green presented the\u000d\u000a      GB scheme to managers of\u000d\u000a      `Countdown Downunder', the Australian national mastitis programme, and the\u000d\u000a      DairyCo Mastitis\u000d\u000a      Control Plan is being used to direct and inform the programmes in\u000d\u000a      Australia (Source 9) and Chile\u000d\u000a      (Prof Green was invited to present to key academic and industrial leaders\u000d\u000a      in 2012). In a statement\u000d\u000a      (2013), the Countdown Project Leader in Australia stated ' Of\u000d\u000a        particular interest to Countdown was\u000d\u000a        the design incorporated into the investigation pathway as delivered by\u000d\u000a        trained GB milk quality\u000d\u000a        advisers outlined within the DairyCo framework. We are also impressed\u000d\u000a        with some of the adviser-farmer\u000d\u000a        communication pathways employed by the DairyCo scheme such as the\u000d\u000a        interactive adviser\u000d\u000a        map on the web resource. It is clear to me, having been involved with\u000d\u000a        the Countdown project since\u000d\u000a        its inception, that we have many useful things to learn about project\u000d\u000a        design, delivery and evaluation\u000d\u000a        from the DairyCo scheme \" (Source 10).\u000d\u000a    The impact of the British national mastitis control scheme is highlighted\u000d\u000a      by its recommendation in\u000d\u000a      the National Dairy Cow Welfare Strategy &#8212; a national strategy for cow\u000d\u000a      welfare supported by all of\u000d\u000a      the major dairy organisations (Source 3). Further evidence of the\u000d\u000a      extent of the impact is found on\u000d\u000a      the DairyCo website (Source 2).

There are five\u000d\u000a      NSAIDs licensed for use in\u000d\u000a      cattle, in the UK (carprofen, flunixin meglumine, ketoprofen, meloxicam\u000d\u000a      and tolfenamic acid). A\u000d\u000a      surge in the use of NSAIDs, particularly Metacam&#8482;, the meloxicam brand\u000d\u000a      sold by BI, has arisen\u000d\u000a      from the research findings and the collaboration between UoN and BI. UoN\u000d\u000a      research was used to\u000d\u000a      inform marketing policy and approach (based on the barriers to use\u000d\u000a      identified in Prof. Huxley's\u000d\u000a      research), leading to considerable gains for animal welfare and clear\u000d\u000a      commercial benefit for BI, the\u000d\u000a      industrial collaborator. Although the research was instigated, designed\u000d\u000a      and independently\u000d\u000a      conducted in academia, much of the original research represents a true\u000d\u000a      HEI-industrial partnership,\u000d\u000a      which has further developed (for example, BI are the industrial partner on\u000d\u000a      a current BBSRC\u000d\u000a      Industrial Case Studentship on which Huxley and Green are the PIs). BI\u000d\u000a      were instrumental in this\u000d\u000a      research from the start, providing financial and logistical support to the\u000d\u000a      UK and wider European\u000d\u000a      work.\u000d\u000a    The response of BI to the publication of the research findings was to\u000d\u000a      instigate a concerted and on-\u000d\u000a      going marketing campaign, aimed at changing the NSAID prescribing habits\u000d\u000a      of farm animal vets\u000d\u000a      and the attitude of farmers to NSAID use. The material and evidence they\u000d\u000a      used to support this\u000d\u000a      campaign was underpinned by the research on farmer and vet attitudes to\u000d\u000a      pain and analgesic\u000d\u000a      usage and the barriers (both real and perceived) to increased NSAID usage\u000d\u000a      in cattle (Source 2).\u000d\u000a      For example, many veterinary surgeons believed that farmers were not\u000d\u000a      prepared to pay for\u000d\u000a      NSAIDs. The research at the UoN demonstrated this not to be the case, and\u000d\u000a      many cattle farmers\u000d\u000a      stated that vets did not discuss pain control with them as often as they\u000d\u000a      would like. This research\u000d\u000a      was pivotal in changing these attitudes and thus the use of NSAIDs (Source\u000d\u000a        2).\u000d\u000a    The increase in use of NSAIDs following the UoN research was dramatic.\u000d\u000a      Between 2008 and 2012\u000d\u000a      the total market value of NSAIDs sold in the UK for use in cattle\u000d\u000a      increased from &#163;4,704,642 to\u000d\u000a      &#163;8,927,556 (a 90% increase; Figure 1). Over the same time period\u000d\u000a      Metacam&#8482;, the meloxicam\u000d\u000a      brand sold by BI has seen its total market value increase from &#163;1,633,295\u000d\u000a      to &#163;4,574,484 (a 180%\u000d\u000a      increase; Figure 1). It is of note that 81% of the increase in\u000d\u000a      total NSAID growth between 2008 and\u000d\u000a      2012 was driven by sales of Metacam&#8482;, which had a greater than fifty per\u000d\u000a      cent market share in\u000d\u000a      2012. All other brands in the market place (&gt;20) saw their combined\u000d\u000a      sales rise from &#163;3,071,347 to\u000d\u000a      &#163;4,353,072 (Source 2). In a statement (2013), the Business Manager\u000d\u000a      &#8212; Cattle of BI stated, 'Our\u000d\u000a        partnership with Professor Huxley and his team at Nottingham University\u000d\u000a        has been central in\u000d\u000a        moving veterinary opinion and thereby validating our promotional\u000d\u000a        activities. The proximity of this\u000d\u000a        team of researchers to the practising veterinary surgeons and the\u000d\u000a        respect with which their opinion\u000d\u000a        is universally viewed has been, I believe, pivotal in changing attitudes\u000d\u000a        to pain relief and behaviours\u000d\u000a        which have brought about this massive increase in use of NSAIDs in\u000d\u000a        general and Metacam in\u000d\u000a        particular. Since the original collaboration between Boehringer\u000d\u000a        Ingelheim and Professor Huxley\u000d\u000a        and his collaborators to investigate attitudes of vets to the control of\u000d\u000a        pain in cattle, a universally\u000d\u000a        beneficial relationship has been created by way of increased profits for\u000d\u000a        our industry and company,\u000d\u000a        a resultant willingness to invest in on-going internal and third party\u000d\u000a        research with the indisputable\u000d\u000a        improvement in animal welfare for which we can all feel justifiably\u000d\u000a        proud\" (Source 2).\u000d\u000a    The beneficiaries of this research are widespread. Pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      companies have benefited from\u000d\u000a      increased sales, which have led to substantial and direct animal welfare\u000d\u000a      benefits via the control of\u000d\u000a      pain and discomfort in treated cattle. It is very difficult to accurately\u000d\u000a      quantify the exact number of\u000d\u000a      additional animals that have benefited (only volume of sales data is\u000d\u000a      available and dose volume is\u000d\u000a      dependent on animal weight). However, if it is assumed that an animal dose\u000d\u000a      has an approximate\u000d\u000a      cost price of between &#163;2 and &#163;20 (calf to adult), in 2012 between 210,000\u000d\u000a      and 2,100,000\u000d\u000a      additional animal doses were administered compared to 2008. Consequently\u000d\u000a      farmers, purchasers,\u000d\u000a      consumers and government have benefitted from an improvement in animal\u000d\u000a      welfare and an\u000d\u000a      assurance that every effort is being made to treat and control pain in\u000d\u000a      this key food production\u000d\u000a      species.\u000d\u000a    Alongside the marketing campaign and in some cases supported by BI, the\u000d\u000a      research clinicians\u000d\u000a      (Huxley &amp; Hudson) have made concerted efforts to raise the profile of\u000d\u000a      this research and pain\u000d\u000a      control in cattle in general (Source 3). Since January 2008 they\u000d\u000a      have delivered eleven training\u000d\u000a      meetings to farmers and industry, three professional development meetings\u000d\u000a      to veterinary\u000d\u000a      surgeons, created an open access webinar (Source 4) and presented\u000d\u000a      the work at nine national\u000d\u000a      and international events\/conferences attended by the dairy industry and\/or\u000d\u000a      veterinary surgeons,\u000d\u000a      reaching an estimated audience of well over 1000 people. Additionally they\u000d\u000a      have publicised the\u000d\u000a      work and the work has been reported directly or indirectly in a wide range\u000d\u000a      of professional journals\u000d\u000a      and industry magazines (Source 5). Finally, based on the interest\u000d\u000a      UoN research generated in this\u000d\u000a      area, XLVets (a veterinary consortium composed of 50 commercial practices\u000d\u000a      across the UK)\u000d\u000a      developed a group-wide training programme (2008-12) to promote the uptake\u000d\u000a      and use of NSAID\u000d\u000a      amongst their farming clients (Source 6). In a statement (2013),\u000d\u000a      the Chief Executive of XLVets\u000d\u000a      said, 'We have greatly appreciated the collaborative approach that you\u000d\u000a        have shown in providing\u000d\u000a        not just the science but also practical solutions and key opinion\u000d\u000a        leadership in the development of a\u000d\u000a        better understanding of pain and analgesia in cattle.

The reasons for this are multi-factorial, and include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Their ancestral heritage as a prey species means cattle are stoic,\u000d\u000a        they mask the signs of pain\u000d\u000a        and its implied weakness, making discomfort difficult to identify.\u000d\u000a      Cattle are large animals, the volume of product required means\u000d\u000a        treatment costs are high.\u000d\u000a      Historically analgesic use has not been considered a social norm in\u000d\u000a        the farming industry and\u000d\u000a        veterinary profession.\u000d\u000a      The research literature has lacked evidence of the benefits of NSAID\u000d\u000a        use in the field.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Strict food safety legislation governs the use of medicinal products in\u000d\u000a      food animal species. NSAIDs\u000d\u000a      are the only licensed analgesics that can be practically administered to\u000d\u000a      cattle, so their underuse\u000d\u000a      represents an important welfare problem for the UK's ten million farmed\u000d\u000a      cattle.\u000d\u000a    UoN research initially used questionnaires to explore the attitudes of\u000d\u000a      cattle veterinarians (641 UK-\u000d\u000a      wide responses; [1]) and cattle farmers (1135 UK-wide responses).\u000d\u000a      These studies gathered\u000d\u000a      extensive data on the viewpoints and opinions of vets and farmers to pain\u000d\u000a      in cattle and their use of\u000d\u000a      analgesics. They identified the huge diversity of opinion in this area and\u000d\u000a      recognized some of the\u000d\u000a      barriers to the wider administration of analgesics. This research strategy\u000d\u000a      developed by Prof Huxley\u000d\u000a      and Dr Whay in the UK was adopted in many parts of Europe (including\u000d\u000a      Spain, The Netherlands,\u000d\u000a      Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, France and Germany) and New Zealand [2].\u000d\u000a      Following this\u000d\u000a      initial attitudinal research, the work focused on addressing some of the\u000d\u000a      knowledge deficits and\u000d\u000a      behavioural barriers that were identified. For example, veterinary\u000d\u000a      respondents to the questionnaire\u000d\u000a      surveys who did not use analgesic agents for a condition, assigned\u000d\u000a      significantly lower pain scores\u000d\u000a      to it. This indicated that one of the key motivators for the use of\u000d\u000a      analgesics was the clinician's\u000d\u000a      perception of the animals' suffering [1]. Consequently a project [c]\u000d\u000a      was mounted with the aim of\u000d\u000a      improving understanding of the clinical beliefs of farm animal veterinary\u000d\u000a      surgeons, within a\u000d\u000a      Bayesian statistical framework, in order to understand and improve\u000d\u000a      clinical decision making [5].\u000d\u000a      Similarly, hock lesions are very prevalent in UK herds and were deemed of\u000d\u000a      minor significance by\u000d\u000a      the respondents of the farmer surveys despite evidence to suggest they are\u000d\u000a      painful. Studies have\u000d\u000a      further explored the pain associated with, and farmer attitudes towards,\u000d\u000a      hock lesions [4; a, b].\u000d\u000a      Recent work has targeted the lack of field based NSAID efficacy studies. A\u000d\u000a      randomised clinical trial\u000d\u000a      has been conducted to investigating the clinical impact of NSAID treatment\u000d\u000a      on lameness, a key\u000d\u000a      endemic disease [d].\u000d\u000a    This collective body of research evidence assessed the attitudes of\u000d\u000a      prescribing vets and identified\u000d\u000a      barriers to NSAID usage and how they could be overcome.

The success of a product, the developing company and their\u000a      contribution to the UK economy is dependent on the quality of the sensory\u000a      testing and sensory research carried out by industry. It is not uncommon\u000a      for UK companies to recruit sensory specialists from abroad due to the\u000a      lack of trained home-based individuals, and this demand continues (Source\u000a        1). The University of Nottingham developed a sensory training\u000a      programme, which now plays an important role in providing a broad, but\u000a      postgraduate level of training in sensory and consumer science. The\u000a      training was initially developed using funding from a `BBSRC Modular\u000a      Training for Industry Programme' grant (Ref BIG\/3\/1\/1, &#163;40K), in\u000a      collaboration with Campden BRI. Campden BRI are still significant partners\u000a      in the programme and see the relationship with Nottingham as very\u000a      beneficial through access to research understanding and its dissemination\u000a      to their members. This has been achieved through additional workshops, at\u000a      which Nottingham researchers have been invited to present (Source 1).\u000a    Registrants to the UoN industry training courses may take a full PG\u000a      Certificate in Sensory Science, or can access stand-alone modules for\u000a      continuing professional development. There are 6 modules related to the\u000a      Sensory training courses; Sensory evaluation and Techniques; Sensory\u000a        Evaluation: Statistical methods and interpretation; Psychophysics,\u000a        Perception and Physiology; Consumer Studies and Market Research; Food\u000a        Flavour and a final industrial based project module for those taking\u000a      the full post graduate certificate. Each of these modules comprise\u000a      lectures, practical activities or draw upon datasets that link directly to\u000a      research programmes carried out at Nottingham. For example since 2008,\u000a      Nottingham's work on brain imaging has been an element of the Psychophysics\u000a      module and is a unique offering on sensory training courses in the UK.\u000a      Prof. Hort's research on multimodal perception forms a significant element\u000a      of the Psychophysics module and provides industry with an\u000a      understanding of the sensory impact of changing ingredients in product\u000a      formulation. The new consumer methodology developed at UoN is incorporated\u000a      into the Consumer Studies and Market Research module. The\u000a      investigations students carry out for the project module draw upon the\u000a      research expertise of their tutors, founded in UoN research programmes.\u000a    Recent delegates on the course have highlighted its importance in\u000a      underpinning their own research. For instance JTInternational (Source\u000a        2) commented that the course has enabled them to `apply effective\u000a        state of the art sensory science in the Fast Moving Consumer Good Market'.\u000a      Similarly, a senior Mars Associate described `Through attendance I have\u000a        been able to directly transfer the theory and practical experiments to\u000a        our research at WALTHAM. The regular contact with the University of\u000a        Nottingham and demonstration of academic excellence has given us the\u000a        confidence to fund research. The outcome of the research has enabled us\u000a        to jointly publish and patent research which is a first for sensory\u000a        science at Mars. Having been able to prove the value in Sensory Science,\u000a        my budget has grown from &#163;0 in 2009 to &#163;100K in 2013' (Source 3).\u000a      Although sensory science is taught on some food related degree courses\u000a      most individuals working in sensory departments, at all levels, enter the\u000a      profession via a different route and so do not have the important training\u000a      required. UoN influence on industry is summarised by Tesco's International\u000a      Quality Manager (Source 4): 'The reputation of Nottingham\u000a        University in sensory science and its link with the industry and\u000a        involvement in research, encouraged Tesco to send five of its members of\u000a        staff on its PGCert in Sensory Science. The valuable knowledge and\u000a        insight into the various sensory methodologies gained has led this to be\u000a        a compulsory course for Tesco sensory scientists, who help shape the\u000a        future of the Quality Team. Furthermore, a key learning and benefit to\u000a        Tesco is the end project our staff undertake on the PGCert. This project\u000a        has enabled our team to develop specialist panels such as profiling that\u000a        has added value to the business and also allowed our staff to experience\u000a        what it is like to create business proposals and identify solutions to\u000a        problems. The course has allowed us to further strengthen\u000a        processes we have in place e.g. panel performance and monitoring of\u000a        profiling panels. It has also allowed us to keep up to speed with the\u000a        latest methodologies, statistical software and thinking. We have also\u000a        gained a strong network of those in the industry whereby we are able to\u000a        bounce ideas and share common problems\".\u000a    The flexibility of the programme means that those working at a technical\u000a      level can attend relevant modules as stand-alone courses (they run\u000a      intensively over 4 days to meet industry needs) or those at a management\u000a      and research and development level can attend all modules to gain a\u000a      postgraduate certificate. This further improves upon their professional\u000a      development. \"Completing the Post Graduate Certificate in Sensory\u000a        Science part-time has been one of the best things that I have done for\u000a        my career. All the modules have given me valuable information and\u000a        guidance which I use every day. I particularly enjoyed the statistics,\u000a        descriptive profiling and consumer studies modules; these have given me\u000a        the information I need to advise clients on the best test for their\u000a        products and ensure that I get the best out of my panel. Although it is\u000a        hard work the benefits are definitely worth the effort and the course\u000a        has the added advantage of allowing me to meet fellow sensory\u000a        colleagues. I would recommend anyone who is starting out in the sensory\u000a        science field or those who want to gain more knowledge complete this\u000a        course\" (Sensory Dimensions delegate 2010-2013) (Source 5).\u000a      Delegates have up to four years to complete the PGCert. To date, 27\u000a      students have graduated, with 14 currently registered. As shown in Figure\u000a        1, since the inception of the Sensory Science courses (2002)\u000a      Nottingham has provided training to over 200 industrial delegates. The\u000a      influence of the courses has increased markedly since 2008 and numbers of\u000a      new registrations for the PGCert and Professional development courses\u000a      increased 20% between 2009 and 2013.\u000a    The Agrifood Training Partnership (AATP) is one of four higher-level\u000a      training partnerships that have been awarded 5 years of funding by BBSRC\u000a      to deliver skills and training to businesses in the agrifood sector. UoN\u000a      is one of four leading internationally recognised university and research\u000a      institute partners (the others are, Cranfied University, Harper Adams and\u000a      Rothamsted Research) working with industry partners including Campden BRI\u000a      and Cambridge University Farm. The AATP scheme (Source 6) has\u000a      attracted additional delegates to the Sensory Science training; about 2\u000a      per course and Nottingham have had 3 enquiries to begin Masters in\u000a      Research in Sensory science through this scheme. In addition to the PGCert\u000a      attendance, UoN have had between 8 and 20 additional short course\u000a      delegates each year attending the modules as CPD training from similar and\u000a      additional companies, and some educational establishments (See Table 1).\u000a      Thus it is evident that the sensory training Nottingham provides and the\u000a      research that supports this is far reaching in terms of its effect in the\u000a      UK food industry. Importantly, several of these individuals and companies\u000a      are based in Europe, e.g. JT International, Mars, Diageo, RHM, and\u000a      consequently, the course is extending the impact of the research and\u000a      training across the globe (Source 2). Joanne Hort's 2013\u000a      appointment as Chair of the European Sensory Science Society has also\u000a      added to the reach and consequent impact these courses attain.\u000a    \u000a\u0009Figure 1.

This work demonstrated the\u000a      capability to increase understanding of food flavour. This early research\u000a      highlighted, for example, UoN expertise in understanding flavour\u000a      perception by combining sensory and instrumental techniques, for example\u000a      Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (APCIMS) and an\u000a      ability to apply advanced sensory methodology. This also initiated a\u000a      relationship with Campden BRI, which led to the initial development of the\u000a      sensory modular training initiative. The academic appointment of Joanne\u000a      Hort as Lecturer in Sensory Science in 2002 strengthened the sensory\u000a      research group. A BBSRC grant to Hort [c] demonstrated\u000a      Nottingham's ability to combine brain imaging and sensory science, showing\u000a      how cortical response differs according to individual taster status and\u000a      that fat in the oral cavity reduces cortical response in areas processing\u000a      flavour [2].\u000a    Professor Hort's work on multimodal perception [d, e, f; 3,4]\u000a      combined APCIMS and sensory techniques to develop understanding of the\u000a      sensory impact of changing ingredients in product formulations [3].\u000a      A DEFRA grant [g] enabled the application of consumer sensory\u000a      methods leading to findings which showed exposure to food can increase\u000a      liking, even when fat and salt content are reduced. More recently, funding\u000a      to investigate the emotional response to food [h &amp; i] has\u000a      revealed how new methodologies such as temporal dominance of sensations\u000a      can provide a fuller sensory profile of products [5]. This work\u000a      highlighted that consumer emotional responses were often more\u000a      discriminating across products than liking and that for some products the\u000a      emotional response to the sensory properties was more important than the\u000a      packaging [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28732","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Food production is the largest manufacturing sector within the UK.

Around 13%\u000d\u000a      of the people employed in manufacturing in the UK work in the food and\u000d\u000a      drink industry and it is of particular significance in our local East\u000d\u000a      Midlands region where 21% of manufacturing jobs are in the food sector.\u000d\u000a      Large multinational corporations lead the industry, but hundreds of small\u000d\u000a      and medium enterprises make a significant contribution to the market,\u000d\u000a      again the proportion is particularly high within the East Midlands.\u000d\u000a      Innovation, sustainability and efficiency in the industry are often\u000d\u000a      dependent upon relationships between manufacturers, processors and\u000d\u000a      academic researchers. The long-term commitment of Food Sciences at the\u000d\u000a      University of Nottingham (UoN) to understanding the interactions between\u000d\u000a      materials and processing and the implications of phase change (the\u000d\u000a      transitions of biopolymers from crystalline to amorphous forms) has\u000d\u000a      brought about a range of benefits to the industry at international,\u000d\u000a      national and local levels. UoN researchers took a fundamental approach to\u000d\u000a      understanding these processes and transferred the knowledge to industry.\u000d\u000a      Engagement with companies has enabled the commercial utilization of the\u000d\u000a      growing knowledge base. It has been the wisdom accumulated through many\u000d\u000a      UoN research projects, that has impacted on the thinking and activities of\u000d\u000a      food and biomaterials companies large and small.\u000d\u000a    As described below, UoN engagement with companies has been extensive and\u000d\u000a      the dissemination and knowledge transfer in relation to biopolymers\u000d\u000a      impacts on the sustainability and competiveness of those using\u000d\u000a      biomaterials, within the food and other industries.\u000d\u000a    Small company activity: The knowledge base\u000d\u000a      generated by UoN research has been effectively disseminated to smaller\u000d\u000a      businesses, particularly to those in the East Midlands. Food and Drink\u000d\u000a      enterprises are a key economic driver in the East Midlands, worth &#163;1.6\u000d\u000a      billion. Along with Yorkshire and Humber regions, the East Midlands is the\u000d\u000a      country's biggest food manufacturing centre. Working closely with the Food\u000d\u000a      and Drink iNet (The Food and Drink innovation Network was established in\u000d\u000a      2008 to co-ordinate specialist support to stimulate innovation in the food\u000d\u000a      and drink industry), UoN has played a key role in increasing the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of local industry, through knowledge and technology transfer\u000d\u000a      (Source 1). Two major EU grants have provided impetus for this\u000d\u000a      knowledge exchange and support for the smaller companies within the East\u000d\u000a      Midlands. UoN expertise on biopolymers has been transferred to SMEs\u000d\u000a      through the UoN Starch Processing Centre (2008-2011). Since inception, 66\u000d\u000a      separate business support activities occurred with 55 different companies.\u000d\u000a      From this activity 621 people were assisted in their skills development,\u000d\u000a      drawing on the expertise of the UoN researchers. This activity was\u000d\u000a      extended through the addition of lipids to the Centre (award 2013-2015)\u000d\u000a      and the concomitant addition of new interactions with the small companies.\u000d\u000a      This makes UoN a key partner in achieving business goals for many food\u000d\u000a      companies (Source 1).\u000d\u000a    National relevance: Supporting commercial operation\u000d\u000a      within the UK food industry by increasing the knowledge base on\u000d\u000a      crystalline-amorphous behaviour of biopolymers is of major strategic\u000d\u000a      importance. There are many examples where UoN expertise has helped\u000d\u000a      companies establish their unique selling points, by allowing them to use\u000d\u000a      scientific knowledge and measurements based upon UoN expertise to create\u000d\u000a      innovative products. An example of this would be GA Pet Foods a\u000d\u000a      manufacturer of own-label innovative petfood. The Managing Director of the\u000d\u000a      company stated (2013), \"GA Pet Foods has invested in excess of &#163;18\u000d\u000a        million in the last three years for the innovative manufacture of dry\u000d\u000a        pet foods. We are particularly interested in using sources of animal\u000d\u000a        protein that shorten the supply chain and do not impact upon the\u000d\u000a        resources being used for human foods. To do this novel manufacturing\u000d\u000a        technologies are required, as well as an understanding of the\u000d\u000a        nutritional benefits that could be gained (Source 2).\"\u000d\u000a      These technologies have been derived from the research work led by UoN. \"To\u000d\u000a        limit risks and provide a credible background for the work, an academic\u000d\u000a        partner with a history of processing and an understanding of the\u000d\u000a        nutritional requirements of animals was necessary.

The\u000d\u000a      retention of a critical mass of technological\/research expertise within\u000d\u000a      the UK is essential for a vibrant food industry. McCain Foods, the world's\u000d\u000a      largest producer of French fries and other oven-ready frozen food products\u000d\u000a      state that \"no small part of the decision\" to base their global\u000d\u000a      batter group in the UK came from their knowledge exchange collaboration\u000d\u000a      with UoN (Source 3).\u000d\u000a    International Engagement: Many international\u000d\u000a      companies use expertise from UoN in support of their manufacturing\u000d\u000a      developments. Pepsico is an American multinational food and beverage\u000d\u000a      corporation with interests in the manufacturing, marketing and\u000d\u000a      distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. A\u000d\u000a      statement from the Head of Breakthrough Foods R&amp;D at Pepsico confirms,\u000d\u000a      \"The Nottingham group have proven themselves to be a key partner for\u000d\u000a        Pepsico in Europe and globally in support of our Foods business,\u000d\u000a        predominately though a combination of their scientific leadership in the\u000d\u000a        area of starch and other complex carbohydrates, and their partnership\u000d\u000a        orientated approach to working with industry\" (Source 4,\u000d\u000a      2013). UoN have acted as first port of call to aid in translation\u000d\u000a      of upcoming technologies for many other companies. Key areas of knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer have been particularly in the field of alternative raw materials\u000d\u000a      and novel processing (Source 2,) and much of this work has been\u000d\u000a      based around enabling companies to understand and monitor factors allowing\u000d\u000a      fat and salt reduction in their products (2-3,6 and e). Pepsico\u000d\u000a      confirm that, \"Knowhow created within Biosciences at Nottingham has\u000d\u000a        been used to understand expansion and quality of such products.\u000d\u000a        Providing a mechanistic understanding of the starch &#8212; biopolymer matrix\u000d\u000a        that enabled the PepsiCo researchers to devise a new approach to product\u000d\u000a        formulation ultimately led to a successful product re-launch of our Oven\u000d\u000a        baked chips from Lays into the Netherlands and Belgium. We first\u000d\u000a        launched Baked Lays in the Netherlands in 2008 and relaunched in 2010\u000d\u000a        with the dramatically improved product design which as a strong\u000d\u000a        contributor to the very strong sales uplift we saw post re-launch &#8212; the\u000d\u000a        product is held to be one of the best Baked Lays product designs in\u000d\u000a        PepsiCo today.\" (Source 4, 2013). Similarly the Director of\u000d\u000a      Fundamental and Applied Research at McCain Foods states, \"McCain's\u000d\u000a        Fundamental Applied Research team has maintained a collaborative\u000d\u000a        relationship with Nottingham University for the past 5 years. In this\u000d\u000a        time the project has produced multiple positive developments\". \"The\u000d\u000a        information and knowledge gained has allowed McCain to complete a long\u000d\u000a        term project in the highly relevant area of fat reduction after many\u000d\u000a        years of work leading to a quantifiable increase in sales and volume. A\u000d\u000a        second project which has real process innovation at its core, again\u000d\u000a        based on starches in our applications, will help us significantly reduce\u000d\u000a        our wastage on a global scale.\" (Source 3).\u000d\u000a    Due to the fundamental approach taken by UoN researchers (a-d, 1-6),\u000a      links with industry and raw material processing have extended from food\u000d\u000a      materials to other biomaterials. UoN is a founding member of the European\u000d\u000a      Polysaccharide Network of Excellence (EPNOE) and within this organisation\u000d\u000a      has helped establish the links between crystalline-amorphous behaviour\u000d\u000a      cellulose and starch which can be applied to non-food materials (Source\u000d\u000a        5). The commercial significance of this is confirmed by a 2013\u000d\u000a      statement from the Head of Global Development and Innovation Textiles at\u000d\u000a      Lenzing Aktiengesellschaft (Source 6), \"Lenzing AG is an\u000d\u000a        Austrian based company specializing in man- made cellulose fibres\u000d\u000a        including the non-woven modal and lyocell (TENCEL&#174;) fibers. The tonnage\u000d\u000a        of fibre produced is ~900,000 per annum and annual sales are in the\u000d\u000a        region of &#8364;2,000 million... The Lenzing Group prides itself in leading\u000d\u000a        this industrial field through innovation and technology. The concepts\u000d\u000a        put forward within the European Network of Excellence in Polysaccharides\u000d\u000a        and the comparative understandings between starch and cellulose, led by\u000d\u000a        the team based in Food Sciences at the University of Nottingham, have\u000d\u000a        been of considerable interest to Lenzing AG. This has contributed to our\u000d\u000a        understanding of the properties of semi crystalline materials and how\u000d\u000a        mixtures of polymers may be of use in developing new materials with a\u000d\u000a        commercial application. New processes from these findings are being\u000d\u000a        considered for commercialisation\".\u000d\u000a    Dissemination of knowledge: The knowledge generated by food\u000d\u000a      scientists at UoN across three decades has generated a body expertise that\u000d\u000a      has been made accessible to small and large businesses. Between 2008 and\u000d\u000a      2013, the transfer of this knowledge has been a driver for product\u000d\u000a      reformulation (Source 4), innovation (Sources 3 and 6),\u000d\u000a      waste reduction (Source 3) and the promotion of a critical mass of\u000d\u000a      expertise in the industry (Sources 1 and 3). A key element of this\u000d\u000a      knowledge transfer from UoN to the local and global food industry has been\u000d\u000a      effective participation and engagement with opportunities for\u000d\u000a      dissemination. For example, the Food Standards Agency, as part of the\u000d\u000a      European Salt Action Network (ESAN), which was set up under the auspices\u000d\u000a      of the World Health Organisation, asked UoN to supply an expert talk at a\u000d\u000a      meeting hosted in Malta for the EU on salt perception and flavour (Source\u000d\u000a        7). Similarly UoN research to improve understanding of the\u000d\u000a      commercial implications of sodium reduction was disseminated to industry\u000d\u000a      through invitations, requested by Pepsico (Source 4) to give\u000d\u000a      knowledge transfer presentations on the relevance of Salt Reduction and\u000d\u000a      Processing at the American Cereal Chemist Association (Source 8).\u000d\u000a      UoN also participates in knowledge transfer activity through direct\u000d\u000a      engagement with companies. For example, Mars established a\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinary research collaboration with Prof. Hill, which informed\u000d\u000a      strategy for their petfood business.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at the University of Nottingham (UoN) has generated a deep\u000d\u000a      understanding of how semi-crystalline biopolymers, particularly starches\u000d\u000a      and cellulosics, can be controlled through processing to create products\u000d\u000a      with predictable behaviour and with enhanced functionality, especially for\u000d\u000a      texture creation.

These methods\u000d\u000a      were required to be robust enough for commercial use as well as being\u000d\u000a      validated by fundamental techniques. These included a range of\u000d\u000a      rheological, spectroscopy (NMR, FTIR, WAX) and thermal analysis\u000d\u000a      techniques. For example an understanding of protein thermoextrusion\u000d\u000a      problems was solved using a combination of capillary rheometry and charge\u000d\u000a      analysis [1]. A battery of tests was constructed to monitor\u000d\u000a      changes in carbohydrate structures across the microscopic, mesoscopic and\u000d\u000a      molecular scales and determine how hydration influenced the behaviour of\u000d\u000a      materials [2,4].\u000d\u000a    Having established a framework that could be used to consider hydration,\u000d\u000a      thermal and mechanical impact on biopolymers the UoN group extended the\u000d\u000a      programme of research into novel areas. Understanding of phase separation\u000d\u000a      and the creation of networks, gained through an understanding of edible\u000d\u000a      food materials, were applied to packaging [d, 4] and cellulosic\u000d\u000a      materials [5]. Concepts describing the loss of crystalline order\u000d\u000a      in complex carbohydrates have been applied to lignocellulose. This has\u000d\u000a      extended knowledge of breakage of the materials for the growing biofuels\u000d\u000a      industry and for the application of cellulosics as renewable resources\u000d\u000a      that can be used in a range of applications [5].\u000d\u000a    One of the major challenges for the food industry has been the reduction\u000d\u000a      expected in the levels of sodium in many foods. This causes technical\u000d\u000a      issues during processing, such as changes in colour and expansion, as well\u000d\u000a      as flavour implications. UoN has tackled this multifaceted problem using a\u000d\u000a      generic materials science approach. This work established that starch\u000d\u000a      structures, at all length scales, are disrupted by sodium in certain\u000d\u000a      processes [6] and it is this that influences the colour of many\u000d\u000a      food products. In addition, understanding the rheology of the matrix has\u000d\u000a      led to a greater understanding of salt release, and hence taste [f].\u000d\u000a      This holistic approach to studying foods, based on a materials science\u000d\u000a      approach, allowed UoN to support the Food Standards agency and companies [e,\u000d\u000a        f] to reduce salt levels across foods of varying water content\u000d\u000a      (soups to crackers) [1-6, a-f].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31750","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The use of e-collars (or \"shock collars\") to train pets is a\u000a      controversial and emotive subject globally.

Our\u000a      engagement with stakeholders at the time (e.g. Mills working with CAWC\u000a      which was feeding into DEFRA) and expertise in managing other\u000a      controversial projects (e.g. Cooper's work on battery hens), along with\u000a      our research reputation in clinical animal behaviour, meant the University\u000a      of Lincoln was in a strong position to lead successful initial and\u000a      follow-up bids for this research.\u000a    Annual progress reports were presented to stakeholders from Defra, the\u000a      Welsh Assembly (who unilaterally introduced a ban in 2010 (4)) and\u000a      Scottish Government (who delayed introduction of planned legislation\u000a      pending the results of our research). Whilst maintaining the necessary\u000a      confidentiality of results, the project team continued to maintain a\u000a      dialogue with other interest groups on both sides of the debate, such as\u000a      the Kennel Club, Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT) and industry\u000a      representatives such as Electronic Collar Manufacturers Association\u000a      (ECMA). This included distribution of detailed research methodologies,\u000a      discussion of training approaches and recruitment of trainers for study,\u000a      and in case of ECMA providing copy of raw data for independent analysis of\u000a      study findings, in order to maintain confidence in the integrity of the\u000a      results as and when they were made available.\u000a    Following lengthy deliberation by government policy makers, Defra\u000a      published the study reports in June 2013, having prepared policy\u000a      statements for use by UK Governments (5). This initiated publicity\u000a      campaigns by UK Kennel Club (6) and ECMA (7), national media attention\u000a      (8,9) and discussion by veterinary (6), pet training (10) and pet owning\u000a      interest groups (9), globally, partly managed by our Press Office. The\u000a      research has therefore had major impact on legislators, campaign groups\u000a      and the pet industry, specifically:\u000a    Government Policy: Defra and Scottish Parliament (5) have now\u000a      indicated that they do not plan to introduce legislation on electronic\u000a      training aids but will work with industry on standards and use, the Welsh\u000a      Assembly will review the ban in Summer 2014.\u000a    Industry: ECMA is working with Defra on self-regulation; changing\u000a      its processes to address issues raised in the study (7). These include a\u000a      revision of the quality of training manuals, tighter regulation of outputs\u000a      of devices and a change in the standards used for reporting of collar\u000a      electrical outputs in line with techniques developed during the study.\u000a    Culture and Society: Campaigners against the use of e-collars In\u000a      the U.K. and abroad (e.g. Canada, see: www.banshockcollars.ca\/alerts.php)\u000a      have used the results to strengthen their argument for an outright ban.\u000a      For example the Kennel Club (6,8,9) have highlighted our finding that\u000a      e-collars are not significantly more effective, but pose greater welfare\u000a      risks than reward based training for even severe problems such as\u000a      livestock chasing. Likewise training groups such as APDT have used our\u000a      results to support their policy opposing the use of aversives in training.\u000a    Animal Health and Welfare: Not only are these results impacting\u000a      directly on animal welfare, with changes being implemented by industry,\u000a      but by raising awareness of our potential to address such issues, we have\u000a      engaged with other stakeholders to address their concerns. For example,\u000a      following a series of meetings with trustees of the charity Feline Friends\u000a      (Derbyshire), they donated &#163;100k to the University to support research\u000a      aimed at addressing the impact of electronic containment systems\u000a      (\"invisible fences\") on cats; systems and species devoid of research as\u000a      noted in the CAWC report.\u000a    Our research impacts on important concerns for society in the U.K. and\u000a      abroad. By working with stakeholders at all stages of the process, we have\u000a      been able to produce impacts that are deep and wide ranging, influencing\u000a      government policy, industry practice, advocacy and the culture of pet\u000a      trainers and owners considering their use globally.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research into the use, welfare consequences and efficacy of handheld\u000a      e-collars in pet dog training is directly linked to current Government\u000a      policy.

A critical appraisal of published literature, and analysis of data\u000a        from a public call for evidence on experience with e-collars (CAWC\u000a      Committee Report1- Mills 2008-12). This systematically\u000a      established the assumptions and quality of evidence both for and against\u000a      the use of these devices. It identified that whilst there was good\u000a      evidence to indicate that these devices could cause\u000a      suffering, there was insufficient evidence to confidently infer that they\u000a      necessarily caused welfare problems. Critically, the\u000a      research identified key gaps in our knowledge and understanding,\u000a      including: the absence of research to test the claim that e-collars are\u000a      essential for the effective treatment of any problem; an important\u000a      distinction between hand-held devices, which depend on an operator for\u000a      activation and boundary fence systems, where the animal's behaviour\u000a      intrinsically controls the delivery of the aversive stimulus.\u000a    2. Model building and field study (Defra Project AW14022,\u000a      &#163;469k &#8212; Cooper, Lincoln and FERA, University of Bristol 2008),\u000a      Firstly we developed a realistic in vitro model of the relevant\u000a      properties of a dog's neck skin (wet and dry) that affect electrical\u000a      conduction and pain perception in vivo. This allowed, for the\u000a      first time, the assessment of e-collar products by probable severity in\u000a      vivo according to their design and settings3.\u000a    Secondly (Cooper, Mills, Ligout, Wright, Lincoln, with colleagues at\u000a      University of Bristol), we undertook the first large scale case-controlled\u000a      field study of pet dogs who had previously experienced training with\u000a      e-collars, to evaluate evidence for long term welfare problems. This\u000a      established that there was a sub-population of e-collar, but not control,\u000a      dogs that showed behavioural and physiological signs of welfare concern.\u000a      The study confirmed the CAWC finding that recall-related problems (e.g.\u000a      livestock chasing) were the commonest indication for e-collar use in U.K.\u000a      pets.\u000a    3. Comparison of training efficacy and welfare of dogs using versus\u000a      not-using an e-collar (Defra Project AW1402a4, &#163;69.9k\u000a    Cooper, Mills, Cracknell and Hardiman, Lincoln 2010). This evaluated\u000a    differences between dogs with recall problems being managed using e-collars\u000a    versus a reward-based training programme. Best practice procedures were\u000a    assured by using trainers either recommended by Electronic Collar\u000a    Manufacturer's Association (ECMA), or affiliated to the Association of Pet\u000a    Dog Trainers (APDT). Owners were generally satisfied regardless of training\u000a    method, but those who worked with reward-based training were more confident\u000a    of applying the training themselves. More potential signs of distress and\u000a    less environmental interaction were recorded in the e-collar trained group.\u000a    There was an elevation in corticosteroids in e-collar dogs on return to the\u000a    training context, which suggested a conditioned aversion. The results\u000a    established that e-collar use is not significantly more effective than\u000a    reward-based training, but carries more risks to dog welfare.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35404","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"934292","Name":"Mauritius"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Following the results of the trials done in 2003-2004, several\u000d\u000a      recommendations on postharvest practices were suggested. It was\u000d\u000a      established that the use of RPCs to attain better temperature control,\u000d\u000a      reduce damage and abrasion to the crop, thus reducing its susceptibility\u000d\u000a      to contract diseases; will result in a reduction on losses on the\u000d\u000a      postharvest of the tomato crop and an increase of the percentage on the\u000d\u000a      top price of the crop. The results also showed a clear benefit on the\u000d\u000a      investment of shallow, smooth sided, vented trays, compared with the\u000d\u000a      traditional use of wooden boxes to store the fruit postharves. The cost of\u000d\u000a      these trays will pay for itself in between one and two harvests.\u000d\u000a    These recommendations have resulted in the reduction of losses of the\u000d\u000a      tomato \"Pomme d'amour\". As a consequence this has had an in\u000d\u000a      important economic benefit to the community of subsistence- farmers of\u000d\u000a      Mauritius. The cooking tomato \"Pomme d'Amour\" is considered the\u000d\u000a      most important crop in the northern part of Mauritius and is an important\u000d\u000a      part of the traditional diet. Almost all the crop is grown by small\u000d\u000a      farmers as a substance for their family, but also an important proportion\u000d\u000a      is sold to local markets. Therefore, the direct beneficiaries or\u000d\u000a      stakeholders are the small subsistence farmers and their families of\u000d\u000a      northern Mauritius who mainly grow the \"Pomme d'amour\" tomatoes on\u000d\u000a      half a hectare or less.\u000d\u000a    After the implementation of the changes to the postharvest management of\u000d\u000a      the tomato in 2005-2006, these stakeholders have greatly reduced their\u000d\u000a      losses and have had a direct relationship on the increase of economic\u000d\u000a      gain. This has become very apparent in the last few years; and by 2010,\u000d\u000a      this reduction of loss has been very similar to what was originally\u000d\u000a      trialled in 2003-2004. Around 20% of reduction in losses has been achieved\u000d\u000a      and there has also been an increase to 60% from 25% on the eventual\u000d\u000a      percentage of top price.\u000d\u000a    Nowadays subsistence farmers in Mauritius are experiencing the benefits\u000d\u000a      in reduction of food loss which in turn has paid for the investment in\u000d\u000a      RPC's in only one to two harvests. The increase of marketable tomatoes of\u000d\u000a      around 2 kg per crate at a mean market price of &#163;1.5-2.0\/kg (in 2013 the\u000d\u000a      mean weekly price varied from &#163;0.7 to 2.7 \/kg http:\/\/www.areu.mu\/apmis\/)\u000d\u000a      compared with the price of the crates of &#163;5.\u000d\u000a    The impact that this research has had to the postharvest of the crop have\u000d\u000a      resulted in lower losses and so it has increased the value chain for the\u000d\u000a      subsistence farmers. For example in a typical year, where two or three\u000d\u000a      harvests can be achieved, if a farmer maintains the same area of tomato\u000d\u000a      production of approximately 0.125 hectares, by using the RPCs there will\u000d\u000a      be an increase in saleable fruit of around 800kg and an increase in income\u000d\u000a      of around &#163;1000.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Writtle College's Postharvest Technology Unit and the Mauritian\u000d\u000a      Agriculture Research and Extension Unit (AREU) studied the use of\u000d\u000a      returnable plastic crates (RPC's) to reduce food losses for subsistence\u000d\u000a      farmers in Mauritius.

This was combined with the fact that any\u000d\u000a      improvement that could be made to the post-harvest of the crop should pay\u000d\u000a      for itself over a short period as the farmers had no financial liquidity.\u000d\u000a    The research consisted of temperature monitoring of the product itself\u000d\u000a      with fly-lead single channel temperature loggers rather than simply\u000d\u000a      measuring the adjacent air temperature. This generated a much more\u000d\u000a      accurate picture of the potential for disease and moisture loss. The\u000d\u000a      research also involved close analysis under the microscope of the tomato\u000d\u000a      surface so as to ascertain skin abrasion that would accelerate moisture\u000d\u000a      loss. The combination of these standard postharvest technology techniques\u000d\u000a      highlighted the problem areas and so meant that the trials could go\u000d\u000a      forward with confidence. The results of the experimental research\u000d\u000a      mentioned above were reported in Bishop et al. 2007; and in Bishop\u000d\u000a      and Hanney, 2008.\u000d\u000a    Later, three experimental trials were undertaken in Mauritius during the\u000d\u000a      harvest season by comparing existing methods with an improved system.\u000d\u000a      These trials occurred in November 2003, March 2004 and September 2004.\u000d\u000a      Research staff involved on the ground in Mauritius was Dr Chris Bishop,\u000d\u000a      Reader in Postharvest Technology Writtle College and Mrs Indoomatee Ramma\u000d\u000a      of AREU and extension colleagues, with support at Writtle College of Dr\u000d\u000a      Alan Gash, Senior Lecturer in Agriculture (Dr Gash left the College in\u000d\u000a      2010) and the results were reported on Bishop and Ramma, 2012.\u000d\u000a    The work was carried out as part of the EU programme (Contract AREU\/\u000d\u000a      EDF\/01) Northern Plains Irrigation Project (NPIP) &#8212; Phase 2 Technical\u000d\u000a      Assistance to Support Diversification 2003-2004 (Contract AREU\/EDF\/01).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35859","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Bovine TB: the problem\u000a      bTB is caused by the pathogen M. bovis, which infects livestock\u000a      and wildlife, with severe socio-economic\u000a      consequences and an impact on animal health. bTB is largely eliminated in\u000a      many\u000a      countries, but the control of M. bovis has proven problematic in\u000a      both Great Britain and Ireland. In\u000a      the absence of improved control, the projected economic burden to Great\u000a      Britain over the next\u000a      decade is predicted to be &#163;1 billion. Though persistence of M. bovis\u000a      in the environment and poor\u000a      test sensitivity may play a role, efforts to understand and control bTB\u000a      centre around the role of the\u000a      Eurasian badger (Meles meles) as a potential reservoir. Despite the\u000a      importance of badgers as a\u000a      wildlife reservoir, this risk is concentrated in the South-West of\u000a      England, and in the rest of Great\u000a      Britain at least half of cases have previously been attributed to recorded\u000a      movements of cattle from\u000a      high risk areas that are under annual testing.

Members from the AHVLA as well as the Chief Veterinary\u000a      Officer for\u000a      Scotland and Scottish Government Scientific advisor joined the Glasgow\u000a      researchers on the\u000a      project steering group tasked with working up the research findings into a\u000a      framework that was\u000a      practical for implementation. In April 2011, the University of Glasgow\u000a      research team presented\u000a      their risk-based bTB model and a range of surveillance options to the\u000a      steering group, and worked\u000a      with them to identify the most appropriate surveillance model to implement\u000a      through existing AHVLA\u000a      channels in Scotland. The final form of the model was presented to the\u000a      Scottish Government\u000a      (including a group of government cattle stakeholders) in May 2011 and\u000a      accepted in June, just 15\u000a      months after the initial research was commissioned.a Details of\u000a      the revised bTB policy and its\u000a      implementation date (1st January 2012) were announced via\u000a      letters sent out by the AHVLA to the\u000a      livestock industry and veterinarians through a Scottish Government press\u000a      release in October 2011b\u000a      which sparked widespread media coverage.c\u000a    The model can be easily adapted at any time to account for changes in\u000a      individual risk factors,\u000a      thereby ensuring that bTB surveillance and resource allocation remain\u000a      optimal in Scotland. To\u000a      ensure the model remains evidence-based, the University of Glasgow has\u000a      been commissioned to\u000a      undertake further monitoring of the surveillance system and consider\u000a      options for improvement\u000a      under the Scottish Government Centre of Expertise in Animal Disease\u000a      Outbreaks, of which Profs.\u000a      Kao and Mellor are Principal Investigators on the Centre Directorate. This\u000a      is the first time that risk-\u000a      based surveillance for bTB has been used in the European Union, and\u000a      therefore the first time that\u000a      a scientific underpinning has been used to inform bTB surveillance.\u000a      Speaking of the University of\u000a      Glasgow-informed Scottish bTB surveillance system, the Chief Veterinary\u000a      Officer for Scotland\u000a      commented...\u000a    `In other OTF countries a wide range of surveillance protocols are in\u000a        operation but none have\u000a        been fully successful. The Scottish risk based system of exemptions is\u000a        therefore truly unique.' d\u000a    Revised Scottish Government policy saves money\u000a      Prior to the introduction of the new risk-based model developed by the\u000a      University of Glasgow, all\u000a      eligible cattle herds in Scotland were tested on a 4 year cycle and annual\u000a      costs for bTB control in\u000a      Scotland averaged &#163;2 million per year. A major aim of the University of\u000a      Glasgow-led policy revision\u000a      was to provide a surveillance system that would save money and more\u000a      effectively target\u000a      surveillance resources. Under the revised policy, simple strategies are\u000a      used to identify premises at\u000a      low risk of infection to exempt them from testing. Additionally, the\u000a      procedures for herd `breakdown'\u000a      follow-up testing have been changed by reducing two testing cycles to just\u000a      one. Unconfirmed herd\u000a      `breakdown' testing at 6 and 12 months after restoration of OTF herd\u000a      status is no longer required\u000a      under the revised policy. The predictive ability of the model provides the\u000a      opportunity for livestock\u000a      owners to implement pre-emptive control measures via preferential purchase\u000a      of cattle from areas\u000a      where bTB is a low risk. As of June 2011 there were 12,580 Scottish\u000a      agricultural holdings\u000a      registered, with typically one herd per holding. Previously, one in four\u000a      of these would have been\u000a      subject to routine herd testing in each year (i.e. 3,145 of them). Of\u000a      these in 2012, 1,018 herds\u000a      (more than 30%) were exempt from routine testing, resulting in savings to\u000a      the Scottish Government\u000a      in the region of &#163;150,000.a,e,f Consequently, the government\u000a      funds saved from the revised policy\u000a      have enabled investment in parallel animal health priorities (such as\u000a      bovine viral diarrhoea\u000a      eradication and reduction of sheep scab) to further enhance the health and\u000a      welfare status and\u000a      reputation of Scotland's livestock industry.d\u000a    Reduction in bTB testing affords benefits to farmers and animal\u000a          welfare\u000a      The reduction in bTB testing in Scotland has also impacted upon farmers,\u000a      veterinarians and cattle.\u000a      For testing to take place, cattle must be gathered and restrained in a\u000a      'crush' (a powerfully built\u000a      cage that holds the animal upright and still) on two occasions, 3 days\u000a      apart. This process\u000a      represents a major challenge as cattle, particularly beef bulls, can\u000a      exceed 1,000 kg in weight. A\u000a      2008 survey commissioned by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)\u000a      identified bTB testing as the\u000a      most hazardous task undertaken by veterinarians, and indeed HSE statistics\u000a      detail incidents where\u000a      farmers have been killed whilst moving their cattle for the purposes of\u000a      bTB testing.h The testing\u000a      process is therefore time consuming, potentially dangerous to those\u000a      carrying out the testing,\u000a      stressful to the animal and very costly in terms of time and effort.\u000a      Reducing the frequency of bTB\u000a      testing and exempting some herds altogether will undoubtedly reduce the\u000a      risks to people and\u000a      stress on cattle resulting from the manual handling involved. The cost of\u000a      the bTB testing process\u000a      for farmers can peak at &#163;50 in profit loss per animal due to reduced\u000a      productivity (weight, milk\u000a      yields). The reduction in bTB testing from the revised policy has\u000a      translated to an estimated saving\u000a      of &#163;100,000 per year to the Scottish farming industry.f\u000a    The success of the Scottish Government policy receives UK wide\u000a          recognition\u000a      Whilst Scotland has been officially bTB free since 2009, incidence rates\u000a      of bTB remain\u000a      problematically high in the southwest of England and parts of Wales and\u000a      Ireland, with an annual\u000a      average of approximately 25% of herds in the South-West under movement\u000a      restrictions due to bTB\u000a      at some point in 2011. Given the wide sale and transfer of livestock\u000a      between regions of the UK,\u000a      these areas represent a challenge to surveillance measures across the\u000a      whole of the UK and bTB\u000a      control remains a high priority issue. In recognition of the Scottish\u000a      policy on bTB testing, the\u000a      Scottish Government bTB policy team was nominated and shortlisted for `The\u000a        Innovative Delivery\u000a        Award' at the 2012 UK Civil Service Annual Awards. These awards are\u000a      designed to showcase best\u000a      practice in implementing technology in government policy making. The\u000a      policy development work\u000a      has been further recognised by the Civil Service, which has translated the\u000a      University of Glasgow\u000a      research behind the Scottish Government policy into a case study on its\u000a      `Open policy making'\u000a      website. The case studies aim to showcase proven best-practice examples of\u000a      policy making,\u000a      highlighting pointers for future approaches. In direct reference to the\u000a      University of Glasgow\u000a      research underpinning the Scottish Government bTB policy cost savings, the\u000a      article states that\u000a      `The academic research is central to this achievement and re-affirms\u000a        the Scottish Government's\u000a        decision to engage academia after it recognised it did not have the\u000a        resources or expertise to\u000a        conduct the research in-house.'h Furthermore the Boyd-Orr\u000a      Centre for Population and Ecosystem\u000a      Health was awarded the 2013 Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and\u000a      Further Education.j\u000a    In response to such advocacy and demonstrable benefits gained from the\u000a      incorporation of the\u000a      University of Glasgow's research into bTB government policy in Scotland,\u000a      the UK Department for\u000a      Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) commissioned the University of\u000a      Glasgow team in July\u000a      2012 (almost &#163;300,000 in funding) to produce a model of risk-based bTB\u000a      surveillance in England\u000a      and Wales, which includes the aim of extending these efficiency measures\u000a      to low risk areas of\u000a      England and potentially Wales.i The AHVLA has supported this\u000a      move by disseminating the\u000a      `Scottish experience' of successful research-led bTB policy development to\u000a      the approximately 200\u000a      Official Veterinarians involved in bTB testing across England, Scotland\u000a      and Wales in its distribution\u000a      profile.k Furthermore, dissemination of the Scottish bTB policy\u000a      to policy audiences as prominent as\u000a      the European Commission has given the University of Glasgow and Scottish\u000a      Government policy\u000a      development work an international profile.d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A University of Glasgow bovine tuberculosis (bTB) surveillance model was\u000a      fundamental to new\u000a      Scottish Government policy on bTB testing. Implemented on 1st\u000a      January 2012, the policy change\u000a      used the Glasgow model to indicate which cattle herds can be exempt from\u000a      routine testing while\u000a      still maintaining Scotland's Officially bTB Free status. In 2012 this\u000a      translated to exemption of more\u000a      than 30% of Scottish herds from routine testing, with an associated\u000a      government saving of\u000a      &#163;150,000. The revised policy also provided savings to the Scottish farming\u000a      industry in the region of\u000a      &#163;100,000 (2012) and limited the risks of bTB testing to farmers,\u000a      veterinarians and cattle.

The\u000a      results, published in\u000a      2012, showed risk in Scotland was most reliably associated with the\u000a      importation of cattle from\u000a      annual testing areas of England and Wales and from Ireland. These import\u000a      risks proved to be of\u000a      particular relevance to `fattening' herds in which cattle are reared for\u000a      slaughter.1\u000a    Development of a risk-based bTB surveillance model\u000a      In 2009, Scotland was granted OTF status, at which point the majority of\u000a      cattle herds in Scotland\u000a      were tested on a standard 4-year cycle. Following this, the Scottish\u000a      Government called for an\u000a      analysis of risk-based veterinary surveillance of bTB to identify possible\u000a      efficiency savings to\u000a      current monitoring systems. Owing to their unique combination of expertise\u000a      in bTB, the cattle\u000a      industry and disease modelling, University of Glasgow researchers led\u000a      jointly by Professor Kao,\u000a      Professor Dominic Mellor and Professor David Logue were appointed by the\u000a      Scottish Government\u000a      in March 2010 to develop a risk-based, bTB surveillance model specifically\u000a      designed for Scotland.\u000a      Based on the risk factors identified for Scotland, the resultant\u000a      predictive statistical model used\u000a      detailed information on the past patterns of herd outbreaks to calculate\u000a      the probability that any\u000a      given herd would be free from infection with M. bovis. This was\u000a      used to assess the relative\u000a      contribution of the following infection risk factors: (i) herd size, (ii)\u000a      the proportion of the herd sent for\u000a      slaughter, (iii) the type of herd (beef, fattening, dairy, etc.), and (iv)\u000a      the receipt of new cattle from\u000a      high incidence bTB areas. Variables were modelled along with the testing\u000a      interval period and the\u000a      probability of slaughterhouse detection of bTB to compare a set of\u000a      risk-based surveillance\u000a      scenarios. Each scenario was compared with the conventional surveillance\u000a      strategy to determine\u000a      which strategies produced better, similar and lower levels of detection.\u000a    These analyses, published in 2013, revealed that by giving consideration\u000a      to these risk factors, only\u000a      65% of Scottish herds would require regular 4-yearly testing to replicate\u000a      the detection rates\u000a      achieved with the conventional system.2 Using this approach,\u000a      only herds in which less than 25% of\u000a      the stock was slaughtered annually or herds for which more than 40% of the\u000a      stock were imported\u000a      on a regular basis needed to be tested every 4 years. Herds in which more\u000a      than 40% of the stock\u000a      was slaughtered each year could be wholly exempted from testing.\u000a      Historically, most false-positives\u000a\u0009  occurred in the now-exempt herds; thus the risk-based approach\u000a      further reduces the\u000a      burden associated with unnecessary testing.\u000a    Key University of Glasgow researchers: Rowland Kao\u000a      (Professor of Mathematical Population\u000a      Biology, 2009-present), Dominic Mellor (Professor of Epidemiology and\u000a      Public Health, 2008-present),\u000a\u0009  David Logue (Professor of Food Animal Disease, 2005-2011;\u000a      Honorary Senior Research\u000a      Fellow, 2011-present), Dr Paul Bessell (Research Associate, 2010-2011; now\u000a      Roslin Institute, May\u000a      2011), Dr Richard Orton (Scientific Programmer, 2009-2012, Research\u000a      Associate, 2012-present).\u000a    Key collaborators: Badger density data were provided by Dr\u000a      Michael Hutchings (SRUC,\u000a      Scotland's Rural College) and Dr Piran White (University of York).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35860","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2395170","Name":"Benin"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The work of Professor Sarah Cleaveland and the University of Glasgow\u000d\u000a      rabies group has had a strong impact in several African countries and at a\u000d\u000a      global level. Their research has led directly to major changes in policy,\u000d\u000a      influencing decisions made by government health and veterinary authorities\u000d\u000a      in Tanzania and Kenya. In Tanzania, this work led to the development and\u000d\u000a      adoption of new standard operating procedures for measures that both\u000d\u000a      control rabies in animal populations and prevent rabies from developing in\u000d\u000a      humans. In Kenya, the team is currently developing a national rabies\u000d\u000a      control and prevention plan for the Kenyan government. At the global\u000d\u000a      level, the team's efforts have led to the drafting of a resolution on the\u000d\u000a      global elimination of canine-mediated human rabies to be taken forward at\u000d\u000a      the WHO World Health Assembly in May 2014, which is the vehicle for\u000d\u000a      controlling the budget and policy decisions of the WHO.\u000d\u000a    In 2009, Cleaveland helped to develop a cost effective package for\u000d\u000a      sustainable canine rabies control at a WHO\/Bill &amp; Melinda Gates\u000d\u000a      Foundation Consultation.a The consultation recommended\u000d\u000a      financial mechanisms by which canine rabies control can be sustained\u000d\u000a      through cost savings in PEP, essentially adopting a `one health' approach,\u000d\u000a      where solutions to rabies control are addressed as a joint concern of both\u000d\u000a      veterinary and medical authorities. Cleaveland's work was debated at the\u000d\u000a      WHO level, demonstrating both the significant health problem posed by\u000d\u000a      rabies and the potential for global uptake of the work of University of\u000d\u000a      Glasgow research, which could lead to effective eradication of the\u000d\u000a      disease.\u000d\u000a    Tanzania: Human post-exposure prophylaxis and dog vaccination\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and 2012, Cleaveland led the `Canine Rabies Elimination\u000d\u000a      Demonstration Project', funded by the WHO\/Bill &amp; Melinda Gates\u000d\u000a      Foundation in Tanzania. At the outset of the project period in 2008,\u000d\u000a      Cleaveland and the Glasgow team (Hampson and Lembo) worked with the senior\u000d\u000a      health and veterinary authorities in Tanzania to develop new national\u000d\u000a      Standard Operating Procedures for both human intradermal PEP and mass\u000d\u000a      canine vaccination, advising on planning, implementation logistics and\u000d\u000a      vaccine options. These were adopted by the Tanzanian authorities in 2009,\u000d\u000a      representing a significant achievement in African public health policy.b,c\u000d\u000a    In 2009 (Nov-Dec), Cleaveland, Hampson and Dr Tiziana Lembo worked with\u000d\u000a      Tanzanian veterinary officials and collaborators from the WHO and United\u000d\u000a      States Centre for Disease Control (CDC) Rabies Team to deliver primary\u000d\u000a      training on the new PEP standard operating procedures to 30 clinicians in\u000d\u000a      Tanzania and on the delivery of mass dog vaccination schemes to 35\u000d\u000a      district veterinary officers. These training sessions were complemented by\u000d\u000a      the training of 22 lab technicians in rabies surveillance techniques (as\u000d\u000a      part of a separately funded programme of implementing effective rabies\u000d\u000a      surveillance in Tanzania; UBS Optimus Foundation, 2008-2011). The aim was\u000d\u000a      for each of these trained professionals to train others and for the nation\u000d\u000a      to build specialist capacity in the veterinary, medical and surveillance\u000d\u000a      aspects of rabies control.\u000d\u000a    The project also included research by both Cleaveland and Hampson\u000d\u000a      (University of Glasgow) on new strategies for human PEP regimens. Working\u000d\u000a      in a project area covering the South-East of Tanzania, the team promoted\u000d\u000a      the use of human PEP vaccination by the intradermal route through training\u000d\u000a      workshops with medical officers from the Ministry of Health, conducted in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the WHO. This was based on research showing it to be a\u000d\u000a      simpler, cost-effective replacement for intramuscular vaccination, due to\u000d\u000a      the lower volume dose required. As a result, since early 2010, the use of\u000d\u000a      intradermal PEP in the project region has increased from 0% to &gt;80% of\u000d\u000a      PEP vaccinations given (see Figure).d Issues of PEP regimen\u000d\u000a      compliance to prevent treatment failure have also been improved through a\u000d\u000a      mobile phone text-based reminder service initiated by Hampson in the\u000d\u000a      project area.d\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    Kenya: Informing a national rabies policy \u000d\u000a    During 2012, Cleaveland was working with the CDC base in Nairobi, which\u000d\u000a      catalysed the establishment of the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU) within the\u000d\u000a      Government of Kenya. Through this collaboration, Cleaveland's expertise in\u000d\u000a      rabies was sought during a large rabies outbreak in the city of Kisumu in\u000d\u000a      western Kenya, and Cleaveland provided operational advice to the\u000d\u000a      veterinary field teams, and organised supplies of vaccine. As a result of\u000d\u000a      this, a plan to develop a national rabies control strategy was initiated\u000d\u000a      by the ZDU, and Cleaveland invited to develop the outline and framework,\u000d\u000a      which was presented to the Kenyan Veterinary Association in April 2013.e\u000d\u000a      The strategy document, which encompasses human PEP, dog vaccination and\u000d\u000a      rabies surveillance in a step-wise approach, is being finalised within\u000d\u000a      the Government of Kenya, and has thus been the subject of national policy\u000d\u000a      discussion.\u000d\u000a    Rabies Blueprint \u000d\u000a    The `Rabies Blueprint' is a web-based resource\u000d\u000a      (caninerabiesblueprint.org), launched in June 2010, providing a\u000d\u000a      step-by-step guide for health authorities in rabies-endemic areas. It was\u000d\u000a      conceived and steered by Lembo and the Glasgow team in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      the Partners for Rabies Prevention, an independent group of rabies experts\u000d\u000a      from international agencies. The Rabies Blueprint combines all of the\u000d\u000a      relevant existing rabies control guidelines, addressing the\u000d\u000a      responsibilities of each stakeholder, legislative frameworks, costs and\u000d\u000a      implementation strategies. Within the first year the site had 46,000\u000d\u000a      visitors (over 2,000 per month) from 157 countries, 1,719 cities and five\u000d\u000a      continents.f The Blueprint has been used in many regions with a\u000d\u000a      high incidence of rabies, such as Africa (Uganda and Benin) and Asia\u000d\u000a      (Afghanistan and Indonesia). For example, the Asia co-ordinator of the NGO\u000d\u000a      `Global Alliance for Rabies Control' uses the Rabies Blueprint for\u000d\u000a      planning their programmes and operational activities in the Philippines\u000d\u000a      and Indonesia, describing it as a `valuable tool for training and\u000d\u000a        implementation of dog rabies control programs' and has cited its use\u000d\u000a      in the WHO strategic framework for rabies elimination in South East Asia\u000d\u000a      (2012).g,h \u000d\u000a    Influencing strategic policy on global health \u000d\u000a    In September 2012, Cleaveland and Hampson were invited to a WHO Expert\u000d\u000a      Consultation on rabies held in Geneva, Switzerland, bringing together the\u000d\u000a      leading practical evidence for discussion and providing a platform to\u000d\u000a      ratify operational recommendations to be advocated at government level.\u000d\u000a      This Consultation urged the WHO to continue to advocate human rabies\u000d\u000a      prevention through the elimination of rabies in dogs and to promote wider\u000d\u000a      use of the intradermal route for human PEP, which University of Glasgow\u000d\u000a      research has shown to reduce the volume and therefore the cost of the\u000d\u000a      cell-cultured vaccine by up to 80%.i\u000d\u000a    `The research conducted by the team has contributed substantially to\u000d\u000a        progress on for example the global burden of rabies and the\u000d\u000a        cost-effectiveness of intradermal rabies post-exposure prophylaxis and\u000d\u000a        rabies surveillance.

Effective vaccines for animals and humans are\u000d\u000a      available, but their use is limited by cost and accessibility. Research\u000d\u000a      undertaken at the University of Glasgow by Professor Sarah Cleaveland and\u000d\u000a      her team has led to the development and adoption of new health and\u000d\u000a      veterinary policies in East Africa, transforming research findings into\u000d\u000a      practical strategies for rabies prevention and control.

If left untreated, the disease is\u000d\u000a      fatal in essentially all individuals once symptoms appear. However,\u000d\u000a      preventative vaccination is almost 100% effective, as is `post-exposure\u000d\u000a      prophylaxis' (PEP) treatment &#8212; but this must be administered within 24\u000d\u000a      hours of exposure to the virus. Despite comparative successes in the\u000d\u000a      control of rabies in Central and South America through mass dog\u000d\u000a      vaccination programmes, the incidence of canine and human rabies in Africa\u000d\u000a      continues to rise, killing around 24,000 people annually (almost half of\u000d\u000a      all cases worldwide). The control and elimination of rabies in Africa and\u000d\u000a      Asia has been hampered by misconceptions about the epidemiology of the\u000d\u000a      disease, the ecology of domestic dogs and the cost of preventing rabies in\u000d\u000a      humans. In particular, policy-makers have often opted for culling `stray'\u000d\u000a      dogs as the principal strategy for canine rabies control and consider\u000d\u000a      wildlife to be the main source of rabies in Africa.\u000d\u000a    In on-going research since 2008, a University of Glasgow team, led by\u000d\u000a      Professor Sarah Cleaveland (Professor of Comparative Epidemiology,\u000d\u000a      2008-present), with Drs. Katie Hampson (Research Fellow, 2009-present),\u000d\u000a      Tiziana Lembo (Postdoctoral Research Associate, 2007-present), Darryn\u000d\u000a      Knobel (Postdoctoral research associate, 2009-2010) has provided key\u000d\u000a      evidence and insight into canine rabies control strategies. These\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that: (i) rabies transmission is not dependent on the density\u000d\u000a      of dogs, therefore the common strategy of indiscriminately culling dogs is\u000d\u000a      likely to be ineffective for rabies control;1 (ii) contrary to\u000d\u000a      common perceptions among policy-makers in Africa, very few (if any)\u000d\u000a      domestic dogs in Africa are ownerless (or stray) and most are accessible\u000d\u000a      for vaccination;5 and (iii) mass canine vaccination is feasible\u000d\u000a      and can result in the elimination of rabies in all species, even in\u000d\u000a      wildlife-rich areas of Africa,3,4 and crucially, is the most\u000d\u000a      cost-effective means to prevent human rabies in rural Africa.5\u000d\u000a    Rabies PEP treatment requires multiple doses, is expensive for developing\u000d\u000a      nations, and places a heavy economic burden on African healthcare systems.\u000d\u000a      In addition, vaccine shortages often occur in Africa. Therefore, PEP is\u000d\u000a      often not available, particularly in rural clinics. This, together with\u000d\u000a      difficulty reaching clinics and poor patient compliance with PEP doses,\u000d\u000a      means that many people die unnecessarily from rabies, particularly those\u000d\u000a      from poor families. In high-throughput clinics, often in urban centres,\u000d\u000a      regimens that use injections into the skin (intradermal delivery) have\u000d\u000a      been recommended as a cost-saving alternative to the conventional\u000d\u000a      injections into the muscle (intramuscular delivery); however, these\u000d\u000a      regimens are rarely used in Africa and have never been evaluated in these\u000d\u000a      settings. In 2010, the research team (Cleaveland and Hampson) simulated\u000d\u000a      different PEP regimens in a range of settings (high-throughput urban\u000d\u000a      clinics and low-throughput rural clinics), identifying the costs to both\u000d\u000a      the health authority (per treatment) and the bite victims, including\u000d\u000a      indirect costs such as travel to clinics. The team found that,\u000d\u000a      irrespective of the type of clinic, a universal switch from intramuscular\u000d\u000a      to intradermal regimens would reduce the amount of vaccine required (by\u000d\u000a      20% in low-throughput clinics and by 80% in high-throughput clinics),\u000d\u000a      resulting in significant savings to public health budgets and mitigating\u000d\u000a      the vaccine shortages that occur widely in Africa.6\u000d\u000a    External collaborators: Deborah Briggs (Global Alliance for\u000d\u000a      Rabies Control) (study of PEP cost-effectiveness); Alena Gsell (Swiss\u000d\u000a      Tropical and Public Health Institute, STPHI) (study of ownerless dog\u000d\u000a      populations in Tanzania).

The industry operates a\u000a      pyramid distribution (Figure\u000a      1) with the upper levels being the `layer-breeders', whose eggs are\u000a      fertilised and hatched. These\u000a      include pedigree birds selected for desirable characteristics, such as egg\u000a      dynamic stiffness (i.e. the\u000a      Kdyn metric tested by Bain). From these birds, the\u000a      great-grandparents and grandparents are bred to\u000a      create the parent stock, which are distributed around the world. It is the\u000a      progeny of these birds, the\u000a      commercial stock, that produce eggs for the table.\u000a    The combined research of Bain and\u000a      McKeegan has contributed substantially at\u000a      key levels within the layer industry\u000a      (highlighted in Figure), to improvements in\u000a      eggshell quality and hatchability and to\u000a      positive legislative change that affects the\u000a      welfare of UK commercial laying flocks.\u000a      These contributions have led to substantial\u000a      improvements in productivity, including\u000a      better eggshell quality, higher chick output\u000a      and decreased incidence of pecking\u000a      injuries, as described below.\u000a    Improving eggshell quality\u000a    As a result of Bain's validation of a novel\u000a      tool for assessing eggshell quality, several\u000a      international specialist layer poultry-breeding\u000a      companies are using the measurement of Kdyn in their breeding\u000a      programmes. These\u000a      include Lohmann Tierzucht GmBH,a a German-based breeder that\u000a      holds a 30% share of the world\u000a      laying market; and Hy-Line International,b a US-based breeder\u000a      that holds 45% of the world market\u000a      and 85% of the US market (the second largest egg-producing market in the\u000a      world). Since 2008,\u000a      both Lohmann Tierzucht and Hy-Line have tested all breeding selection\u000a      candidates for Kdyn in all\u000a      four of their pedigree lines for white and brown egg stocks,a,b\u000a      with Lohmann using the technology\u000a      on more than 20,000 pedigree birds annually. The process from selection of\u000a      pedigree birds using\u000a      Kdyn to commercial egg production takes approximately 3 years;\u000a      thus, table eggs with improved\u000a      stability have been available on the market since 2011.\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    \u000a    To poultry companies such as Lohmann Tierzucht, the benefit of improved\u000a      egg quality is not only\u000a      relevant to commercial layers, but also benefits the breeding sector\u000a      because eggs with better shell\u000a      quality have improved `hatchability', leading to a higher chick output.a\u000a      Lohmann Tierzucht also\u000a      claim that \"Eggs from birds with better DS [dynamic stiffness] achieve\u000a        a better revenue through\u000a        higher percentage of saleable eggs in relation to total eggs produced,\"\u000a      citing 2% fewer egg\u000a      seconds depending on the age of the flock.a\u000a    Both companies have UK subsidiaries supplying substantial shares of the\u000a      UK market, with\u000a      Lohmann GB (36%) and Hy-Line UK (30%) accounting for 66% of all day old\u000a      chicks.a,b Both\u000a      companies use a single hatchery, Millennium Hatchery in Warwickshire,\u000a      owned by Hy-line UK. The\u000a      hatchery produces infrared beak-trimmed\/vaccinated day-old chicks that are\u000a      transferred to rearing\u000a      farms for 16 weeks, after which they go into commercial layer\u000a      egg-production farms. Between\u000a      them, Lohmann GB and Hy-Line UK are responsible for some 22.4 million of\u000a      the 34 million laying\u000a      hens in the UK, all of which will have been selected for improved eggshell\u000a      quality on the basis of\u000a      the Kdyn measure, and which are capable of producing in excess\u000a      of 310 eggs per bird per annum\u000a      with an annual packer-to-producer value of approximately &#163;500 million.\u000a      Therefore, the estimated\u000a      2% fewer egg seconds claimed by Lohmann incorporating Kdyn into\u000a      their selection programs will\u000a      have saved up to &#163;10 million per annum to UK egg producers alone.\u000a    Influencing UK policy on welfare and productivity of commercial\u000a          laying flocks\u000a    Between 40% and 80% of the 35 million laying birds in the UK are subject\u000a      to injurious bird-on-bird\u000a      pecking, which can escalate to cannibalism, causing up to 20% mortality.c\u000a      To minimise this risk,\u000a      every hen hatched by Lohmann GB and Hy-Line UK, and intended for the\u000a      commercial production\u000a      of eggs with improved eggshell quality, has its beak trimmed using\u000a      infrared technology before\u000a      leaving the hatchery. Carefully managed breeding programs and investment\u000a      in improving eggshell\u000a      quality is intrinsically dependent on the welfare, and therefore\u000a      productivity, of layer hens. DEFRA\u000a      has estimated the economic benefit to the egg industry of birds not being\u000a      injured or killed (bird-on-bird)\u000a      could be anywhere between &#163;4.82 and &#163;12.3 million per annum.c\u000a    However, an EU directive (1999\/74\/EC) outlining the minimum standards for\u000a      keeping egg laying\u000a      hens had also prohibited all mutilation, and the UK enactment of this\u000a      legislation &#8212; including a ban\u000a      on beak trimming by any means &#8212; was due to be implemented on 1st\u000a      January 2011. In 2007, the\u000a      Farm Animal Welfare Council advised the government of the implications of\u000a      this ban, recognising\u000a      the greater welfare issue of pecking injury and the lack current UK\u000a      practice to prevent it if the ban\u000a      went ahead.d McKeegan's research, commissioned by DEFRA and the\u000a      BEIC in 2008, was\u000a      instrumental in the UK Government's decision not to go ahead with the ban\u000a      on beak trimming. The\u000a      findings were presented to DEFRA in March 2009,e and considered\u000a      by the Farm Animal Welfare\u000a      Council.f The findings were then summarised in a wider\u000a      consultation,g between January and April\u000a      2010, which was circulated to 79 poultry industry stakeholders, including\u000a      industry representative\u000a      bodies, animal welfare groups, veterinary associations, Government\u000a      agencies, academic institutes,\u000a      consumer groups and retailers.\u000a    The new draft regulations `Mutilations (Permitted Procedures) (England)\u000a      (Amendment) Regulations\u000a      2010' were presented to the Joint Committee for Statutory Instruments by\u000a      DEFRA in November\u000a      2010, together with an explanatory memorandum explaining the evidence\u000a      base, citing the Glasgow\u000a      research.h On 7th December 2010, the amendment was\u000a      debated by the First Delegated Legislation\u000a      Committee. Mr Plaice (Minister of State for DEFRA) stated: \"the\u000a        researchers believe infrared was\u000a        the least painful method. I have said in my opening speech that we\u000a        accept that it does cause pain.\u000a        We do not believe that it causes chronic pain; the research at Glasgow\u000a        demonstrated that even if\u000a        neuromas are present, they are not functioning.\" The committee voted\u000a      to extend the use of routine\u000a      beak trimming of laying hens, but restricted the method used to the\u000a      infrared technique only.i\u000a    The new amendment came into force on 23 December 2010, preventing the\u000a      ban, which was due to\u000a      be implemented on 1st January 2011. Thus, McKeegan's research\u000a      has resulted not only in the\u000a      maintenance of improved welfare standards for laying birds, but also the\u000a      avoidance of what would\u000a      have been substantial economic losses for the industry had the ban gone\u000a      ahead.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Key findings of two University of Glasgow research programmes have\u000a      transformed the UK egglaying\u000a      industry, driving substantial improvements in productivity and bird\u000a      welfare.

For\u000a      decades, poultry-breeding\u000a      companies used laboratory-based measurements, such as shell-breaking\u000a      strength and\u000a      non-destructive deformation, in their selective breeding programmes to\u000a      improve eggshell quality.\u000a      Although such traits are heritable, none has been proven to influence the\u000a      rate of egg breakage that\u000a      occurs during routine handling.\u000a    During the late 1990s, a test was developed at Leuven University,\u000a      Belgium, to detect both cracked\u000a      eggs and those at risk of cracking. This test evaluates the acoustic\u000a      vibration response of an egg\u000a      when subjected to a non-destructive impact generated by a lightweight\u000a      hammer making contact as\u000a      the egg rotates around its long axis, providing a measure of the ability\u000a      of an egg to dampen\u000a      vibration (`dynamic stiffness' or Kdyn). However, for this text\u000a      to be useful to the poultry industry, the\u000a      heritability of Kdyn and its value for predicting egg breakage\u000a      during routine handling first required\u000a      demonstration. Between 2001 and 2004, as part of the European Union (EU)\u000a      project `Egg\u000a      Defence', Bain and her team collaborated with Dr Ian Dunn (Roslin\u000a      Institute, UK), researchers at\u000a      Leuven University and Lohmann Tierzucht GmBH (a primary breeder of\u000a      egg-laying hens). Two\u000a      studies investigating Kdyn were proposed and led by Bain and\u000a      Dunn.\u000a    The first study, conducted between 2002 and 2003, showed that Kdyn\u000a      has a moderately high\u000a      heritability (i.e. the trait will respond directly to genetic selection)\u000a      and correlates positively with\u000a      other eggshell quality measures, such as breaking strength and thickness\u000a      (which can only be\u000a      determined by destroying the egg).1 Bain measured the eggshell\u000a      quality data of 3,000 eggs from a\u000a      pedigree population provided by Lohmann Tierzucht, comprising 1,500\u000a      offspring derived from\u000a      mating 32 sire with 240 dams. Dunn conducted the statistical modelling and\u000a      calculated the\u000a      heritability and genetic correlation for Kdyn from Bain's data\u000a      and values provided by Lohmann\u000a      Tierzucht.\u000a    The follow-up study (March 2004) established that Kdyn can\u000a    identify `risky' eggs.2 A field study was\u000a    set up by Bain in collaboration with Scottish egg producer Glenrath Farms\u000a    Ltd., who provided full\u000a    access to their production unit and grading equipment. The statistical\u000a    analysis was performed by\u000a    the team at Roslin. Of 1,660 eggs measured before and after passing through\u000a    the collection and\u000a    grading equipment, those with higher Kdyn values were\u000a    significantly less likely to be cracked.\u000a    Therefore, University of Glasgow research played a key part in validating Kdyn\u000a    as a useful tool for\u000a    selecting hens with superior eggshell characteristics, and in demonstrating\u000a    that this measure\u000a    reflects susceptibility to cracking during routine handling.\u000a    Contribution statement from B. De Ketelaere and J. De Baerdemaeker,\u000a      Leuven University: \"Our\u000a        group has performed quite extensive research into [Kdyn],\u000a        and collaborated with Dr. Maureen Bain\u000a        in order to gain more insight, not only into its relation to breakage in\u000a        practice, but also with respect\u000a        to its heritability. This research was published jointly with the group\u000a        of Maureen [Bain] taking the\u000a        lead. We believe that both aspects, for which credit goes to Maureen\u000a        [Bain], have triggered the\u000a        wide interest in the AET [Acoustic Egg Tester] by major poultry\u000a        companies worldwide.\"\u000a    Determining the consequences of beak trimming\u000a    Injury caused by bird-on-bird pecking affects laying hens in both\u000a      intensive (cage) and extensive\u000a      (barn and free-range) systems, and is a major welfare and economic issue.\u000a      Commercial egg\u000a      producers use beak trimming to minimise such damage, which can result in\u000a      the loss of breeding\u000a      stock and egg production. However, beak trimming can potentially cause\u000a      loss of normal beak\u000a      function (reduced ability to feed, drink and preen), and short-term or\u000a      chronic pain and debilitation.\u000a    Beak trimming was traditionally performed by hand, using a hot blade to\u000a      simultaneously cut and\u000a      cauterise the beak. In 2008, McKeegan characterised the physiological\u000a      response of birds to\u000a      infrared beak trimming. This procedure uses a high-intensity infrared\u000a      energy source, which is\u000a      localised, non-contact and can be automated. This research &#8212; jointly\u000a      commissioned by the\u000a      Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the British\u000a      Egg Industry Council\u000a      (BEIC) &#8212; assessed the chronic sensory (i.e. welfare) consequences of\u000a      infrared beak trimming.3\u000a      Beak nerve function and anatomy were examined at a range of ages in both\u000a      trimmed and non-trimmed birds by: (i) recording the responses of single sensory nerve\u000a      fibres that provide sensation\u000a      in the lower beak and (ii) by detailed microscopic and X-ray measurements\u000a      of beaks. The results\u000a      suggested that infrared trimming does not cause chronic pain or other\u000a      adverse consequences for\u000a      sensory function, such as neuromas (pain and abnormal sensations generated\u000a      by bundles of\u000a      nerves). The beaks of birds across all age groups tested had full\u000a      sensation with no evidence of\u000a      pain or numbness, even in regrown beak tips. Examination of beak healing\u000a      showed nerve\u000a      regeneration and the presence of specialised touch receptors by 10 weeks\u000a      after infrared trimming.\u000a    This research provided evidence that infrared beak trimming represents a\u000a      refinement compared\u000a      with previous approaches and that the welfare cost of beak trimming (acute\u000a      pain and some on-going loss of sensation) might be outweighed by the benefits (reducing\u000a      suffering and mortality of\u000a      injured laying hens; fewer hens injured or lost from bird-on-bird\u000a      pecking).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35862","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Glasgow CMPS-SF\u000a      Assessing pain in animals is a challenge for veterinarians because of the\u000a      inherent communication\u000a      difficulties and because different animals and species have varying\u000a      responses to pain. An animal\u000a      will experience acute pain immediately after a traumatic injury (e.g.\u000a      after breaking a bone or\u000a      following surgery) and appropriate intervention with pain relief can\u000a      significantly enhance recovery\u000a      and minimise the risk of chronic pain developing. The CMPS-SF is the first\u000a      statistically validated\u000a      scale to incorporate a structured and objective approach to pain\u000a      assessment in dogs. This\u000a      behaviour-based assessment provides an accurate, unbiased indication of\u000a      the pain level\u000a      experienced by the animal. The assessment is easy and quick to perform\u000a      with results available in\u000a      3&#8212;4 minutes. Uniquely, the CMPS-SF provides a threshold for analgesic\u000a      intervention, thereby\u000a      enabling clinical decision making on pain relief provision.\u000a    A practical resource for veterinarians to guide clinical decisions\u000a      The CMPS-SF is available for open-access download from the University of\u000a      Glasgow website.\u000a      Since 2008, the CMPS-SF has been downloaded by 3266 non-academic users\u000a      worldwide &#8212; 3109\u000a      and 157 of whom stated their intended use was in veterinary practice and\u000a      industry, respectively.a\u000a      However, once downloaded the CMPS-SF can be copied; download data are,\u000a      therefore, likely to\u000a      underestimate total usage. The CMPS-SF is further disseminated and used\u000a      within the veterinary\u000a      profession through its inclusion in textbooks, establishing it as a\u000a      standard reference for measuring\u000a      pain for both teaching and veterinary practice. The CMPS-SF has featured\u000a      in key pain\u000a      management handbooks for practitioners such as `Anesthesia for\u000a        Veterinary Technicians' (2010)\u000a      and `Practical Emergency and Critical Care Veterinary Nursing'\u000a      (2013), with global sales of 2,600\u000a      and 750 respectively.b\u000a    Impacts on the veterinary healthcare industry\u000a      As detailed below, the CMPS-SF has been used by the following\u000a      market-leading veterinary\u000a      healthcare companies since 2008: Merial, Novartis Animal Health Inc.,\u000a      Nexcyon Pharmaceuticals\u000a      Inc., Vetoquinol, Dechra and Animalcare.\u000a    Use of the CMPS-SF in clinical trials and regulatory application for\u000a        novel analgesics\u000a      Before new analgesic drugs for animals can be made available on the\u000a      market, they must gain\u000a      regulatory approval, a process that relies on robust clinical trial data\u000a      that demonstrate a drug's\u000a      effectiveness in the target species using validated pain measurement\u000a      scales.

Since mid-2012, its UK subsidiary has\u000a      used the CMPS-SF as\u000a      marketing support for its pain medications (including Cimalgex&#174;&#8212;the\u000a      fastest growing non-steroidal\u000a      anti-inflammatory drug for dogs in the UK and Ireland).d The\u000a      company has reproduced the original\u000a      copy and layout of the CMPS-SF on Vetoquinol branded pads containing 50\u000a      leaves of the\u000a      questionnaire (see example sheet). Vetoquinol specifically chose the\u000a      CMPS-SF acute pain scale\u000a      because:\u000a    `it is scientifically validated and well known in the UK whilst being\u000a        simple to use....it was\u000a        recommended to us by various veterinary surgeons throughout the UK'e\u000a    Almost 2,000 copies of the pad have been distributed (100,000\u000a      individual copies of the acute pain scale) to complement\u000a      Vetoquinol products. The Vetoquinol CMPS-SF marketing\u000a      supporting materials were a major focus of Cimalgex&#174;\u000a      promotional activities at the London Vet Show (November 2012)\u000a      and British Small Animal Veterinary Association Congress\u000a      exhibition (April 2013)d &#8212; these prominent events were attended\u000a      by over 3300 and 4000 veterinary professionals respectively.\u000a    Since 2010, Animalcare have employed a similar use of the\u000a      CMPS-SF to support their analgesic products. The company\u000a      have distributed the CMPS-SF in pads (50 sheets) to veterinary\u000a      surgeons and nurses across the 4,000 practices in their UK\u000a      territory through their `lunch and learn' programme. During these\u000a      sessions the territory managers inform staff on `why and how' to\u000a      use the CMPS-SF thus `[promoting] awareness of the scale to\u000a        vets and nurses (many of whom have limited time and finances to attend\u000a        external CPD).' e\u000a    \u000a   \u000a    \u000a    In spring 2013 the Dechra UK Marketing Team confirmed the key inclusion\u000a      of the Glasgow CMPS-SF\u000a      in its new UK-wide marketing campaign of Comfortan&#174;\u000a      (the UKs only veterinary licenced\u000a      methadone) via distribution of the CMPS-SF in a laminated form with the\u000a      product. Prior to spring\u000a      2013 Dechra had been directing customers to the CMPS-SF download at the\u000a      University of\u000a      Glasgow website. The decision to formally incorporate the Glasgow CMPS-SF\u000a      into the marketing\u000a      material was taken following an internal recommendation of the scale by\u000a      Dechra's technical team\u000a      who highlighted the CMPS-SF as `the most recognisable system' and\u000a      one which was `easy to use',\u000a      `familiar to most vets and nurses' and `known internationally by\u000a        [Dechra's] other international\u000a        territories'.f\u000a    Recognition of the University of Glasgow CMPS-SF\u000a      In 2009, the University of Glasgow research team was awarded the\u000a      Universities Federation for\u000a      Animal Welfare (UFAW) inaugural Companion Animal Welfare Award for the\u000a      development of the\u000a      CMPS-SF acute pain scale.

The assessment and treatment of pain in animals has long been\u000a      a controversial and\u000a      often overlooked issue. For the past 15 years, the University of Glasgow\u000a      School of Veterinary\u000a      Medicine Pain and Welfare group, led by Professors Andrea Nolan and Jacky\u000a      Reid, have\u000a      conducted comprehensive studies to identify the underlying pathophysiology\u000a      and pharmacology of\u000a      pain in animals, establishing how pain can be practically assessed and\u000a      managed by veterinarians.\u000a    Revealing the pathophysiology and pharmacology of pain in animals\u000a      The research group characterised the presence of pain and its underlying\u000a      mechanisms using two\u000a      models of disease in sheep: a clinical model of pain &#8212; sheep foot rot; and\u000a      the experimental sheep\u000a      model using injection of an inflammatory and pain sensitising agent\u000a      (carrageenan). Through these\u000a      translational research studies Professor Nolan (along with Dr Dolan, now\u000a      Glasgow Caledonian\u000a      University) identified spinal cord glutamate receptors in pain pathways\u000a      that could be directly\u000a      targeted by analgesic drugs,1 and described two glutamate\u000a      receptor subtypes (group I and II),\u000a      which each had a different response threshold to mechanical stimulation.2\u000a      In contrast to sheep with\u000a      experimentally-induced pain, sheep with clinical pain induced by foot rot\u000a      were shown to have\u000a      higher levels of two additional glutamate receptor subtypes (mGluR3\u000a      and mGluR 5) in the spinal\u000a      cord.3 The group also examined the expression of two genes (cyclooxygenase-2\u000a      and Egr-1) that\u000a      are markers of neuronal changes in spinal cord tissue taken from animals\u000a      with clinical pain induced\u000a      by persistent inflammation.4 Pain treatment reduced changes in\u000a      these genes, thereby preventing\u000a      the evolution of chronic pain. Nolan's group was the first to show altered\u000a      levels of glutamate\u000a      receptors in the sheep spinal cord after surgery, and to demonstrate that\u000a      treatment with non-steroidal\u000a      anti-inflammatory drugs after surgery could increase subsequent pain\u000a      thresholds.\u000a    Development of a robust and validated pain assessment questionnaire\u000a          for dogs\u000a      Aware of the McGill pain scale &#8212; an objective scale for assessing pain in\u000a      humans &#8212; and the\u000a      absence of a similar scale in veterinary medicine, the University of\u000a      Glasgow researchers worked to\u000a      develop a questionnaire for assessing acute pain in dogs. At that time,\u000a      pain management in\u000a      veterinary medicine was a much neglected field, and there were no valid\u000a      tools to assess pain in\u000a      any animal species. The questionnaire was developed between 1997 and 2007\u000a      in collaboration\u000a      with Professor Marian Scott (University of Glasgow School of Mathematics\u000a      &amp; Statistics). The group\u000a      adopted a psychometric approach to tool development. They surveyed 69\u000a      practising veterinarians\u000a      to provide words and expressions that represented their observational\u000a      assessment of a dog\u000a      experiencing pain. A total of 279 words obtained were reduced to 47 and\u000a      refined into seven\u000a      behavioural categories. A second group of 75 veterinary surgeons allocated\u000a      intensity values to the\u000a      range of words within each category and the resulting product was named\u000a      the Glasgow Composite\u000a      Measure Pain Scale (CMPS). The group then optimised the CMPS into a form\u000a      that was practically\u000a      quick and easy to use. The CMPS short form (CMPS-SF) contained 30 word\u000a      descriptors within six\u000a      categories of behaviour in dogs (vocalisation, attention to painful area,\u000a      mobility, response to touch,\u000a      demeanour and posture\/activity). Each category was numerically ranked\u000a      according to associated\u000a      pain severity. The sum of the rank scores yielded the composite total pain\u000a      score out of 24 (or 20 if\u000a      it was not possible to assess mobility). The CMPS-SF was applied by a\u000a      group of veterinary\u000a      surgeons from 3 international, English speaking sites to a total of 122\u000a      dogs post-surgery. These\u000a      individuals were also asked to indicate the level at which they felt the\u000a      dog required analgesia\u000a      based on their clinical judgement. A score equal to or greater than 6\/24\u000a      (or 5\/20) indicated the\u000a      point at which animals were experiencing significant pain levels.\u000a      Importantly, the CMPS-SF was\u000a      the first validated pain scale to define a threshold for intervention with\u000a      analgesics in dogs.6\u000a    Together, the underpinning research for the CMPS\/CMPS-SF was supported by\u000a      over &#163;400,000 of\u000a      funding from Pfizer animal health and the BVA welfare trust.\u000a    Key researchers: Andrea Nolan (Professor of Veterinary\u000a      Pharmacology [1998-present], Vice\u000a      Principal (VP) Learning &amp; Teaching [2004-2009], Senior VP &amp; Deputy\u000a      Vice-Chancellor [2009-July\u000a      2013]); Jacky Reid (Professor of Veterinary Anaesthesia [1998-2006],\u000a      Honorary Senior Research\u000a      Fellow [2006-present); Marian Scott (Professor of Environmental Statistics\u000a      [2000-present]).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35863","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research at the University of Glasgow has systematically supported feline\u000a      health care by providing\u000a      a reference point for expertise, reagents and testing services.

These tests have been used in big cat\u000a      species, which are also\u000a      susceptible to viruses such as FIV and FeLV. Willett and Hosie adapt tests\u000a      developed for domestic\u000a      cats for use in big cats held in European captive-breeding programmes.\u000a      Such tests are required for\u000a      the safe transfer of animals between zoos, and, according to veterinary\u000a      advisors, the University of\u000a      Glasgow offers the most comprehensive feline virus testing service.c\u000a      Between 2008 and 2012, the\u000a      service performed 30 tests per year for Amur leopards,d the\u000a      world's most endangered big cat\u000a      species with just 130 animals worldwide; and since 2008, performed 29\u000a      tests for Asiatic lions,c a\u000a      highly endangered cat that is at risk of contracting FIV from African\u000a      lions housed within the same\u000a      zoo. In 2011, the service screened 41 Iberian lynx to rule out a viral\u000a      cause for an epidemic that\u000a      affected most of the captive population. Willett also advised on the\u000a      safest vaccine for inoculation of\u000a      these animals, as vaccines can be contaminated with viruses that do not\u000a      affect domestic cats but\u000a      can harm big cat species.e\u000a    Feline vaccine development\u000a    The development and testing of vaccines against FeLV and FIV has\u000a      positioned the University of\u000a      Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine as a key reference point for vaccine\u000a      developers.\u000a    Vaccine development\u000a    The 1993 collaborative research with Merial on a recombinant FeLV vaccine1\u000a      provided the\u000a      underpinning technology for the development of one of the leading\u000a      international vaccines against\u000a      FeLV (PUREVAX FeLV). This vaccine, used in healthy cats aged 8 weeks and\u000a      older, was licensed\u000a      in 2000 and is sold as both a single vaccine and a multi-vaccine\u000a      combination; [text removed for\u000a      publication]. In January 2012, a new version of the vaccine with improved\u000a      efficacy was launched in\u000a      the USA, based on the same underpinning technology.f\u000a    Vaccine testing\u000a    In 2008, Pfizer Animal Health asked Willett and Hosie to perform\u000a      screening for the presence of\u000a      neutralising antibodies (produced in response to vaccination), which\u000a      provide a measure of\u000a      immunity conferred by a vaccine. Pfizer requested tests of blood samples\u000a      from cats immunised\u000a      with their FeLV vaccine (Leukocell 2) as part of a long-term vaccine\u000a      serology study. Pfizer (now\u000a      Zoetis) has a commitment to long-term data collection, underpinning their\u000a      Companion Animal\u000a      Immunisation Support Guarantee, which covers reasonable diagnostic and\u000a      treatment costs if a pet\u000a      vaccinated with a Leukocell 2 contracts FeLV. At the time, Pfizer did not\u000a      have the internal expertise\u000a      to perform this test, and considered the University of Glasgow to have the\u000a      best expertise in the\u000a      field and thus the preferred choice.g\u000a    Vaccine safety\u000a    In 2010, a feline retrovirus (RD114) was found to have contaminated\u000a      vaccine products. While\u000a      RD114 poses little risk to domestic cats, it does pose a risk to millions\u000a      of juvenile dogs treated with\u000a      the same vaccines, as well as big cat species. Hosie and Willett were\u000a      asked by two of the world's\u000a      largest veterinary pharmaceutical companies, Merial and Intervet (now MSD\u000a      Animal Health), to\u000a      provide a reference standard of purified RD114, as attempts to work with\u000a      RD114 from the\u000a      American Type Culture Collection (a global resource for such biomaterials)\u000a      had failed. The\u000a      Glasgow RD114 enabled these companies to successfully develop tests for\u000a      its detection and meet\u000a      the demands of the regulators. Merial stated that `the quality of RD114\u000a        stock provided by Pr M.\u000a        Hosie was better and allowed us to continue our work....without this\u000a        virus, we would have\u000a        experienced additional delays in our ability to develop those tests and\u000a        reply to the regulatory\u000a        authorities in the context of an investigation on the presence of RD114.'f\u000a      Similarly, MSD Animal\u000a      Health stated, `having this material has allowed MSD AH to continue to\u000a        provide quality feline\u000a        vaccine products.'h\u000a    Veterinary care\u000a    Hosie's research on feline viral diseases has yielded expert advice for\u000a      veterinary practitioners in\u000a      domestic pet practice. She is one of four UK experts on the 17-member\u000a      European Advisory Board\u000a      for Cat Diseases (ABCD). This organisation provides evidence-based\u000a      guidelines for the prevention\u000a      and management of major feline infectious diseases, including the choice\u000a      of vaccines and\u000a      vaccination protocols. ABCD also helps veterinarians to raise awareness of\u000a      infectious diseases\u000a      among cat owners. Hosie was lead author of the ABCD guidelines for the\u000a      prevention and\u000a      management of FIV.i These guidelines recommend against\u000a      euthanisation of cats with FIV and\u000a      provide recommendations for clinical management. They also draw upon\u000a      research performed at\u000a      the University of Glasgow that indicate that the current vaccine provides\u000a      limited protection against\u000a      common virus strains in Europe and thus its use is not recommended. The\u000a      guideline was published\u000a      in the International Society for Feline Medicine's journal in 2009, and\u000a      launched at the annual\u000a      congress of the European Society for Feline Medicine to 419 vets from 26\u000a      countries.j The 2009\u000a      guideline has been downloaded 695 times between Jan 2012 and July 2013,\u000a      and its updated\u000a      version (published in June 2013) was downloaded 287 times between June and\u000a      July 2013.k The\u000a      veterinary officer of International Cat Care &#8212; a leading international cat\u000a      welfare charity &#8212; stated\u000a      that, \"...these articles are highly thought of and highly regarded,\u000a        with a lot of clinical use.\"k\u000a    Hosie was also lead author of a new `Matrix' guideline (2013).l\u000a      This document offers veterinarians\u000a      guidance in conducting interviews with pet owners to determine vaccination\u000a      strategies appropriate\u000a      to the lifestyle, geographical location and disease risk of each cat. The\u000a      guideline has been\u000a      downloaded 266 times since June 2013.k It also addressed\u000a      concerns raised in the veterinary\u000a      industry, articulated in a British Small Animal Vet Association (BSAVA)\u000a      policy statement, regarding\u000a      adverse reactions in cats (such as tumours at injection sites) linked to\u000a      the frequency of vaccine\u000a      boosters. In this respect, the BSAVA supports the ABCD guidelines, which\u000a      recognise that some\u000a      core vaccines are required by all cats while others are only required\u000a      under certain circumstances.m\u000a      Hosie has been invited to share her expertise in the prevention,\u000a      management and treatment of\u000a      feline viral diseases caused by FIV, FeLV and other viruses at Continuing\u000a      Professional\u000a      Development days organised for veterinarians by Merial.

The research\u000a      described is by Professors\u000a      Oswald Jarrett, James Neil, Margaret Hosie and Brian Willett; since 1993\u000a      they have worked closely\u000a      on shared research themes, each independently leading collaborative work\u000a      on key feline viruses.\u000a    Feline leukaemia virus\u000a    The University of Glasgow has a long history of research on feline\u000a      leukaemia virus (FeLV), the\u000a      most frequent cause of cancer among cats; FeLV also weakens the feline\u000a      immune system. This\u000a      once common virus was first discovered and described at the University of\u000a      Glasgow in the mid-1960s.\u000a      Due in part to research efforts at Glasgow the prevalence is now below 1%,\u000a      although the\u000a      rate is markedly increased among kittens and cats that are already ill.\u000a    FeLV vaccine development\u000a    In 1993, the University of Glasgow collaborated with the French animal\u000a      health company Merial to\u000a      develop a new vaccine against FeLV.1 Unlike previous vaccines\u000a      based on killed FeLV virus, the\u000a      new vaccine was based on the canarypox virus, a bird virus that can enter\u000a      non-bird cells, but\u000a      cannot replicate and can therefore be used to initiate an immune response\u000a      in other species without\u000a      causing infection. In this work, Neil provided the FeLV genes that encode\u000a      immunoreactive\u000a      components from an infectious strain of the virus (known as Glasgow-1),\u000a      while Jarrett led the\u000a      testing of the vaccine's efficacy.1 Jarrett's laboratory\u000a      provided the viral challenge systems and\u000a      expertise needed to assess the level of protection provided by the\u000a      vaccine, which were superior to\u000a      that available within Merial at that time.\u000a    Feline immunodeficiency virus\u000a    Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection is one of the most common\u000a      infectious diseases\u000a      among cats, with a prevalence of 6% in the UK (up to 14% among cats with\u000a      an underlying illness).\u000a      Infection with FIV is characterised by a progressive impairment of the\u000a      immune system with clinical\u000a      signs resembling human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\u000a      University of Glasgow\u000a      research has contributed significantly to the understanding of the feline\u000a      immune response to FIV.\u000a    Understanding the feline immune system\u000a    Before the 1990s, the cat immune system was poorly understood and no\u000a      quantitative data were\u000a      available regarding the immune responses in healthy and ill animals. Thus,\u000a      identification of the\u000a      immune cells involved in cat immunity was pivotal to research progress.\u000a      Since 1993, Hosie and\u000a      Willett, together with Jarrett and Neil, have developed key tools for\u000a      investigating the mechanisms\u000a      of feline viral infections. These tools included cat-specific antibodies\u000a      to detect the presence of FIV\u000a      and cell lines to allow growth and purification of feline viruses.2\u000a      In addition, they developed\u000a      `pseudotype' viruses, which carry the immune reactive surface proteins of\u000a      one virus (e.g. FIV) upon\u000a      the inactivated particle of another virus (commonly HIV). Pseudotypes\u000a      provide an effective way to\u000a      study the key reactive components of a virus and &#8212; in the case of HIV(FIV)\u000a      pseudotypes &#8212; to\u000a      measure the strength of antibody response against FIV.4\u000a    These research tools were used to unravel the mechanisms used by such\u000a      viruses to enter cat\u000a      immune cells. Viruses need to recognise and interact with specific\u000a      molecules (receptors) on the\u000a      surfaces of cells to enter them and cause infection. In studies published\u000a      in 1997 and 2004 &#8212; the\u000a      latter in collaboration with researchers at the University of Tokyo, Japan\u000a      (who created the\u000a      molecular clones of cat immune cell genes) &#8212; Willett and Hosie identified\u000a      the key receptors\u000a      recognised by FIV and demonstrated for the first time a common mechanism\u000a      of infection by FIV\u000a      and the related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).3,4 The\u000a      development of specific antibodies\u000a      against these receptors facilitated subsequent worldwide investigations of\u000a      virus-receptor\u000a      interactions and the validation of FIV infection of cats as an animal\u000a      model for human AIDS. In\u000a      1999, in collaboration with researchers in Portland, USA, Willett used a\u000a      similar approach to identify\u000a      the receptors targeted by FeLV, the presence of which on red blood cells\u000a      are the means by which\u000a      FeLV subgroup C can cause anaemia.5\u000a    FIV vaccine development\u000a    Between 1993 and the present, the University of Glasgow team have been\u000a      involved in research to\u000a      develop vaccines &#8212; including DNA-based vaccines &#8212; against FIV, as well as\u000a      testing the efficacy of\u000a      vaccines developed elsewhere against existing UK viral strains. In 1995,\u000a      Hosie defined the nature\u000a      and extent of the immune response conferred by a prototype of the current\u000a      commercial FIV\u000a      vaccine.6 Although a strong response was detected against the\u000a      viral strain used to develop this\u000a      vaccine, weaker immunity was observed against a highly aggressive field\u000a      strain (known as\u000a      Glasgow-8), representative of strains found in the cat population of the\u000a      UK. This finding\u000a      demonstrated the need for careful optimisation of vaccines to ensure that\u000a      they conferred immunity\u000a      to various strains of FIV, particularly virulent strains.\u000a    Key University of Glasgow researchers: Oswald Jarrett\u000a      (Professor of Comparative Virology,\u000a      1980-2002); James Neil (Professor of Virology and Molecular Oncology,\u000a      1981-present); Margaret\u000a      Hosie (Research Fellow 1991-1996; Senior Research Fellow 1998-2008;\u000a      Professor of\u000a      Comparative Virology, 2008-present); Brian Willett (Reader, 1989-2008;\u000a      Professor of Viral\u000a      Immunology, 2008-present).

It operates from its\u000a      main office in Eberswalde University under the management of two\u000a      Co-Directors: Dr P Hobson and Professor P Ibisch, and is currently\u000a      supported by Foundations of Success for Europe (Mrs I Tilders), Nature\u000a      Conservation for Europe (Mr S Mueller-Kraenner), and the European\u000a      Conservation Coaches Network (ECNet). Recently, it has established a\u000a      memorandum of understanding with the Centre for International Development\u000a      and Training at Wolverhampton University and also with the Wilderness\u000a      Foundation.\u000a    The objectives of the Centre are to grow the specific brand of research\u000a      underpinning \"econics\" and to develop mechanisms for applying the theory\u000a      to meet the requirements of the sector. At the moment most of the\u000a      international activities of the Centre are sponsored by four key\u000a      collaborative partners all of which are based in Germany. They are the\u000a      German Government agencies: GIZ; The German Federal Agency for Nature\u000a      Conservation (Bundesamt f&#252;r Naturschutz, BfN); the German Academic\u000a      Exchange Service (DAAD); and German branch of World Wild Fund for Nature\u000a      WWF.\u000a    After the success of the tenth Conference of the Parties of the Bern\u000a      Convention (COP10) and the publication by Ibisch et al. edited by the\u000a      Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (see 2 on section 3\u000a      above) a number of high profile contracts were agreed with the German\u000a      Agency, GIZ to implement \"MARISCO\" (a method in vulnerability assessment\u000a      and adaptive management recently developed by the Centre) in the planning\u000a      process for protected area management. The first of the contracts was a\u000a      two year project (BIOMARC) working with national park staff from two of\u000a      the main marine reserves in Costa Rica. The task was to develop a MARISCO\u000a      model for managers to use in the planning process for both parks. The\u000a      successful outcome of the project prompted further discussions with GIZ on\u000a      ways to widen access to the MARISCO process for all the international\u000a      conservation partners working with GIZ. As a result a second contract was\u000a      signed for the production of a manual detailing the science and method of\u000a      MARISCO for the purpose of circulating to all the GIZ partner\u000a      organisations in conservation. The manual and accompanying video was\u000a      produced in 2013 (see 6 on section 3 above)\u000a    Raising the Centre's profile both through scientific publications and\u000a      activities with GIZ was a contributing factor to the development of a\u000a      working partnership with the Government agency, BfN. Two main projects\u000a      were launched in 2012. The first relates to the Centre's research\u000a      expertise in forest ecosystem function (see 3 on section 3 above),\u000a      and is a contract to co-ordinate a UNESCO World Heritage European Beech\u000a      Project. The goal is to establish by 2014 \"World Heritage\" status for a\u000a      network of prime sites for European beech across its entire range of the\u000a      continent. Identifying appropriate indicators of forest ecosystem function\u000a      that could then be used by scientific staff in the project team to select\u000a      priority sites for natural old growth beech was a key factor in the\u000a      process. The second contract is to apply MARISCO to the process of\u000a      planning for a UNESCO transboundary biosphere reserve in the Altai\u000a      Mountains across the Russian and Kazakhstan border.\u000a    The scientific robustness of MARISCO enables practitioners to use the\u000a      method to test and evaluate in detail existing practices in land use\u000a      management. MARISCO is being applied this way in a project funded by the\u000a      German branch of WWF to assess the effectiveness of FSC forestry schemes\u000a      operating in Russia. The successful completion of the first phase of the\u000a      project have simulated negotiations for a new four year contract to employ\u000a      the method in an assessment of certification schemes in oil palm\u000a      plantations in South East Asia and Argentina.\u000a    Providing training in specific skills directly related to the needs of\u000a      the sector is one of the key objectives of the Centre and at the moment\u000a      MARISCO is the main vehicle for delivering outcomes in this area. Many\u000a      organisations within the environmental sector recognize a gap in the\u000a      understanding and applied knowledge of complex cultural ecosystems amongst\u000a      both existing and prospective employees. Often, highly qualified students\u000a      and staff with academic knowledge in specific disciplines lack the\u000a      necessary skills to transfer and apply their understanding to problems\u000a      encountered within a multi-disciplinary environment. Using its knowledge\u000a      and research expertise in ecosystem science and complex systems theory the\u000a      Centre has, for the last two years, worked with the German Government\u000a      agency, DAAD, to deliver training in Ecosystem Diagnostics Analysis and\u000a      MARISCO to both postgraduate students and employees in the environmental\u000a      sector within Albania. After the successes of the first consultancy\u000a      project the Centre was encouraged to submit proposals for a larger,\u000a      regional programme of training for postgraduates and professional staff\u000a      across Montenegro, Albania and Kosovo. This latest contract will run for\u000a      two years.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Centre for Econics and Ecosystem Management is the product of six\u000a      years of international collaborative research and sector-based consultancy\u000a      between Writtle College and Eberswalde University for Sustainable\u000a      Development (Germany).

At Writtle\u000a      Dr Hobson has been working with principles of non-equilibrium\u000a      thermodynamics to advance techniques in assessing the ecological status of\u000a      forests.\u000a    The first two years of a PhD project (2006-2007) were carried out in\u000a      collaboration with Oulanka Biological Station, Finland with funding\u000a      assistance from the Lapland Atmosphere-Biosphere Facility (LAPBIAT).\u000a      Initial findings of this PhD research by P Mickleburgh confirmed a link\u000a      between vegetation function and the thermodynamic attributes of a system,\u000a      and also a degrading in both factors brought on by direct and indirect\u000a      human disturbance (Hobson and Mickleburgh, 2008).\u000a    In Eberswalde, Professor Ibisch, together with a PhD student was\u000a      developing techniques for applying theories of complex systems and\u000a      ecosystems to adaptive conservation management. A first meeting between\u000a      the two scientists at a British Ecological Society conference in 2006 set\u000a      out a plan to establish a collaborative single body of scientific research\u000a      drawing on the complementary studies on non-equilibrium thermodynamics and\u000a      the theories of complex systems and ecosystems.\u000a    The opportunity to present the two complementary areas of research arose\u000a      in 2009 at a special topics seminar chaired by both Hobson and Ibisch\u000a      during the 2nd European Congress for Conservation Biology in Prague.

Both students were working with\u000a      principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and complex systems theory to\u000a      derive effective measures of assessing ecosystem function at different\u000a      scales of observation. In the case of Norris, empirical evidence was\u000a      gathered from study sites at landscape scale across a variety of\u000a      ecosystems in the UK, Germany and Ukraine. Whilst Freudenberger analysed\u000a      global metadata to assess the function of ecosystems and to use this data\u000a      to prioritise areas for conservation.\u000a    Alberto Vega, the German Secretary to the United Nations Congress for\u000a      Biological Diversity (CBD) attended the conference and later invited the\u000a      research team to publish their findings in the CBD technical Series and\u000a      also to present papers during a special seminar at the 2010 COP10 World\u000a      Congress in Nagoya, Japan explaining the relevance of their research to\u000a      global strategies of biodiversity sustainability. Subsequently, the theory\u000a      underpinning the emergent concept of \"econics\" was laid out in a\u000a      comprehensive series of papers in the CBD technical series 54\u000a      Interdependence of Biodiversity and Development Under Global Change (eds.\u000a      Ibisch, Vega and Herrmann, 2010). Shortly afterwards, in 2011 the Centre\u000a      for Econics and Ecosystem Management was launched by Dr Peter Hobson and\u000a      Professor Pierre Ibisch, www.centreforeconics.org.\u000a    In the inaugural year of the Centre a substantial piece of research on\u000a      thermodynamic measures in forest landscapes was published in Applied\u000a      Ecology (see Norris et al. 2011), followed in the next year by two related\u000a      papers on using measures of thermodynamics to assess global ecosystem\u000a      function (see Freudenberger et al. 2012; 2012). The joint efforts of both\u000a      research branches provided an appropriate framework on which to build the\u000a      theoretical platform underpinning a recently developed adaptive management\u000a      method for conservation called Adaptive Management of Risk and\u000a      vulnerability at Conservation sites (MARISCO). With support and funding\u000a      from the German agency, Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#252;r Internationale\u000a      Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), in 2013 the manual entitled, \"Adaptive management of\u000a      Vulnerability and Risk at Conservation sites: A guidebook for risk-robust,\u000a      adaptive and ecosystem-based conservation of biodiversity\" (Editors,\u000a      Pierre Ibisch &amp; Peter Hobson), was published together with a short\u000a      website video on \"MARISCO method\" displayed on Vimeo and available here: http:\/\/www.centreforeconics.org\/publications-and-products\/adaptive-conservation-and-vulnerability-marisco\/.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37248","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    Gastrointestinal dysfunction and disease is the most common cause of\u000d\u000a      hospital admission in the\u000d\u000a      UK, making it a heavy burden for patients, the NHS and the economy.

Prebiotics are non-digestible food components that selectively\u000d\u000a      encourage proliferation of\u000d\u000a      beneficial colonic microflora. Bacteria belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium\u000d\u000a      and Lactobacillus\u000d\u000a      are most commonly targeted by prebiotics. Since his appointment as\u000d\u000a      Professor of Food\u000d\u000a      Microbiology at the University of Reading in 1999, Gibson has continued to\u000d\u000a      develop and extend his\u000d\u000a      work on prebiotics, which has included extensive commercial application\u000d\u000a      and the development of a\u000d\u000a      novel prebiotic for use in humans named Bimuno. The Bimuno development\u000d\u000a      programme brought\u000d\u000a      together Gibson's research on prebiotics with Professor Bob Rastall's\u000d\u000a      (Department of Food and\u000d\u000a      Nutritional Sciences, 1994 &#8212; present) research on enzymic development of\u000d\u000a      novel functional food\u000d\u000a      ingredients. Together, they set out to develop a novel prebiotic designed\u000d\u000a      to benefit human health\u000d\u000a      and well-being. Their aim was to improve upon existing products by\u000d\u000a      synthesising a prebiotic that\u000d\u000a      would enhance the growth of beneficial groups of bacteria with greater\u000d\u000a      efficacy than previously\u000d\u000a      achieved.\u000d\u000a    A candidate prebiotic must escape digestion in the upper gut, reach the\u000d\u000a      large intestine, and be\u000d\u000a      utilised selectively by a restricted group of microorganisms that have\u000d\u000a      clearly identified health\u000d\u000a      promoting properties. Among dietary oligosaccharides,\u000d\u000a      galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are the\u000d\u000a      most promising candidates as potential prebiotics, as they have been\u000d\u000a      associated with increased\u000d\u000a      populations and fermentation products of Bifidobacterium spp.\u000d\u000a    Assessing novel GOS mixture synthesised with enzymes from Bifidobacterium\u000d\u000a          bifidum\u000d\u000a    GOS are synthesized by enzymatic catalysis of lactose using a\u000d\u000a      &#946;-galactosidase enzyme. The\u000d\u000a      amount and nature of the GOS mixture synthesized is dependent upon the\u000d\u000a      source of the enzyme\u000d\u000a      as well as reaction conditions. Typically, GOS are synthesised through\u000d\u000a      enzymatic catalysis of\u000d\u000a      lactose using 03b2 galactosidase enzymes derived from yeasts or bacilli.\u000d\u000a      However, Gibson and\u000d\u000a      Rastall aimed to improve the selectivity of their GOS by sourcing\u000d\u000a      03b2-galactosidase from a beneficial\u000d\u000a      bacterial (probiotic) strain, Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIMB 41171.\u000d\u000a      Their hypothesis was that the\u000d\u000a      target bacteria will more readily metabolise prebiotics produced from\u000d\u000a      enzymes originating from\u000d\u000a      their conspecifics, resulting in a higher selectivity.\u000d\u000a    Gibson and his colleagues at Reading developed their novel GOS mixture,\u000d\u000a      known as Bimuno,\u000d\u000a      and assessed its prebiotic potential in vitro and in pigs. They\u000d\u000a      monitored changes in the gut bacteria\u000d\u000a      in response to different doses of Bimuno [1]. The prebiotic significantly\u000d\u000a      increased the density of\u000d\u000a      colonic bifidobacteria providing evidence for its potential as a prebiotic\u000d\u000a      [1]. In 2008, the researchers\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that the beneficial effects of Bimuno also extended to\u000d\u000a      humans, but also that GOS\u000d\u000a      mixtures produced with different 03b2 galactosidases showed different\u000d\u000a      prebiotic properties [2]. The\u000d\u000a      GOS mixture derived using enzymes from B. bifidum, produced a\u000d\u000a      larger ratio of bifidobacteria in\u000d\u000a      the gut than existing prebiotics [2].\u000d\u000a    Assessing response to Bimuno in targeted groups of people\u000d\u000a    Gibson and his colleagues then conducted a series of trials to test\u000d\u000a      whether Bimuno had effects in\u000d\u000a      groups of people with compromised colonic microflora. They conducted a\u000d\u000a      trial on elderly people, as\u000d\u000a      aging is associated with a reduction in beneficial bacteria and increased\u000d\u000a      gut inflammation. In 2008,\u000d\u000a      they reported that Bimuno significantly increased numbers of\u000d\u000a      bifidobacteria, at the expense of less\u000d\u000a      beneficial bacteria and that certain markers of the immune response,\u000d\u000a      including anti-inflammatory\u000d\u000a      mediators, were positively affected [3]. A trial in patients with\u000d\u000a      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in\u000d\u000a      2009, provided evidence that Bimuno not only changed the colonic\u000d\u000a      microflora in sufferers by\u000d\u000a      enhancing proportion of bifidobacteria, it alleviated many of their\u000d\u000a      symptoms [4]. In 2010, a trial with\u000d\u000a      otherwise healthy travellers showed that the group taking Bimuno as a\u000d\u000a      preventative measure\u000d\u000a      before travelling, experienced a significantly reduced incidence and\u000d\u000a      duration of traveller's diarrhoea\u000d\u000a      [5]. Most recently, Gibson and his colleagues conducted a trial assessing\u000d\u000a      the effect Bimuno had on\u000d\u000a      overweight adults. Again, Bimuno altered the gut microbiota toward a more\u000d\u000a      beneficial composition\u000d\u000a      and improved immune function, as well as markers of the metabolic syndrome\u000d\u000a      [6]. This series of\u000d\u000a      trials not only established the novel GOS mixture, Bimuno, as an effective\u000d\u000a      prebiotic, but also as a\u000d\u000a      potentially helpful for several conditions.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37263","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Reading's research findings were presented to Defra, Natural England,\u000a      National Farmers Union, Home Grown Cereal Authority and farmers through a\u000a      combination of scientific publications, project reports, presentations and\u000a      discussion meetings.\u000a    Influencing management options in AES\u000a    The Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) scheme and associated guidance\u000a      handbook, was rolled out in 2005, with updated versions of the handbook\u000a      published in 2008, 2010 and 2013. The Reading research was \"immediately\u000a        picked up in the scheme design and rolled-out as an option\" [a]. The\u000a      research, which identified the \"crucial importance of the need to\u000a        manage margins (e.g. through a summer cut of the outer 3m of 6m margins)\u000a        has been carried through into scheme design\/delivery\" [a].

The Royal Society for the Protection of\u000a      Birds (RSPB) provides advice for farmers on maintaining field margins on\u000a      grasslands [e] and arable land. Results of SAFFIE \"have been used\u000a        extensively to inform practical implementation of measures (on RSPB\u000a        landholdings and advisory guidelines to other land managers) and in\u000a        policy advocacy\" [c]. Butterfly Conservation also provides advice\u000a      around supporting butterfly diversity in farmland that recognises the\u000a      importance of maintaining flower-rich margins [f].\u000a    Influencing projects that bring environmental and economic benefits\u000a      The management options under AES and guidance provided by various NGOs in\u000a      relation to field margins has been influenced by the research conducted at\u000a      Reading. These projects have in turn led to considerable environmental\u000a      benefits. Between 2005 and 2009 in England, there were 21,463 agreements\u000a      set up containing field margin options that incorporated Reading's\u000a      research. In 2009 alone there were 1,977 agreements for option EF4 (Nectar\u000a      Flower mixture) with a total area of 2,002ha. By 2013 the number of\u000a      agreements had increased by 38% to 2,728 with an area of 3,618ha (59%\u000a      increase). This equates to 34,736 ha of farmland that has undergone\u000a      changes mandated by the scheme and outlined in the ELS handbooks,\u000a      improving habitat for declining species including kestrels and severely\u000a      declining species like UK tree sparrows [g]. While the exact economic\u000a      benefit of improved biodiversity is difficult to estimate, a survey\u000a      conducted in 2010 [g] estimated the benefit of AES in England to be\u000a      between &#163;0.8 billion and &#163;1.5 billion per year based on citizens'\u000a      willingness to pay.\u000a      Helping the UK government meet national and international\u000a          biodiversity commitments\u000a    In 2008, the Joint Nature Conservancy Committee revised the cereal field\u000a      margin priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan\u000a      (BAP) to broaden the scope to arable field margins [h]. These priority\u000a      habitats were identified as the most threatened and requiring conservation\u000a      action under the UK BAP and are now used under the UK Post-2010\u000a        Biodiversity Framework to help set conservation priorities at the\u000a      country level.\u000a    At an international level, the management of field margins is driven by\u000a      numerous international policies and directives, including the Nitrates\u000a      Directive, the Water Framework Directive and Environmental Stewardship.\u000a      Therefore, well-evidenced management strategies for field margins help\u000a      support UK government implementation of these directives [i]. The UK\u000a      government uses AES options, such as field margins, as a contribution to\u000a      its commitments to the European Union and Convention on Biological\u000a      Diversity.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted by the University of Reading between 2002 and 2007\u000a      influenced management options mandated under the UK Government's\u000a      agri-environmental schemes.

Bio-diverse environments\u000a      are more stable and more resilient to adversities such as pests, disease\u000a      and climate change. They provide a greater range and value of eco-system\u000a      services, providing food, clean water, cycling of nutrients, crop\u000a      pollination, recreational and other benefits (see UK National Ecosystem\u000a      Assessment, 2011).\u000a    Since 1987, the UK has used Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) to protect\u000a      and improve biodiversity and to meet its legal commitment to the European\u000a      Union, which made agri-environment programmes compulsory for Member States\u000a      in 1992. The AES need to provide farmers and other land managers with a\u000a      range of management options to support wildlife and the UK Department for\u000a      Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and other sponsors\u000a      commissioned research to identify potential options for inclusion in\u000a      English AES.\u000a    Testing management options for uncultivated margins in arable\u000a          fields\u000a      Intensively managed fields for agricultural purposes have led to declining\u000a      populations of UK grassland flora and fauna. Uncultivated field margins\u000a      provide a straightforward way of improving biodiversity and as such, the\u000a      establishment of grassy strips at the margins of arable fields is an AES\u000a      option. However, the outcomes of some management practices and the\u000a      respective benefits to plant and animal populations were only partially\u000a      understood in 1980-1990s.\u000a    In 2002, the Sustainable Arable Farming For an Improved Environment\u000a      (SAFFIE) [7] project was established, which brought together leading UK\u000a      researchers to develop and test `field margin' and `in field' options to\u000a      inform AES. A team from the University of Reading led the work on field\u000a      margins and coordinated the contributions of other partners, including the\u000a      Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and the British Trust for\u000a      Ornithology (BTO). The Reading team included Simon Potts, Professor of\u000a      Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (2002- ), Valerie Brown, Director of\u000a      Centre for Agri-Environmental Research and Professor of Agri-Environmental\u000a      Science (2000-2004), Dr Ben Woodcock, Research Fellow (2002-2007), Dr\u000a      Duncan Westbury, Research Fellow (2002-2008), Dr Jo Smith, PhD student\u000a      (2004-2007) and Dr Alex Ramsay, Research Fellow (2003-2007).\u000a    Between 2003 and 2007, Reading quantified the responses of all plants and\u000a      all invertebrates (except bumblebees and butterflies, which was led by\u000a      CEH) to different field margin types, using several innovative large-scale\u000a      manipulative field experiments in three experimental farms and 26\u000a      commercial farms throughout the UK. The team manipulated management\u000a      practices such as seed mix and management type. Reading compiled the\u000a      results from all partners into the final report on field margins [1].\u000a    The research findings identified management options that were most\u000a      effective in enhancing biodiversity around arable land. For example, they\u000a      found that sown seed mixtures that provided large scale architectural\u000a      diversity along the field margins supported a greater abundance and\u000a      diversity of beetles [2]. The team also found that minimising soil\u000a      cultivation encouraged beneficial litter-dwelling soil invertebrates [3].\u000a    Testing management options for uncultivated margins in grasslands\u000a      During the same time period (2002-2007), Reading was a partner in the\u000a      first ever large-scale UK grassland study, the Potential to Enhance\u000a      Biodiversity in Intensive Livestock farms (PEBIL) [8], which looked at the\u000a      response of multiple taxa to different types of field margins around\u000a      pastures. Reading led the assessments of all invertebrates to complement\u000a      work on plants, which was led by the Institute of Grassland and\u000a      Environmental Research (IGER), and birds, which was led by the BTO.\u000a    Reading implemented manipulative field experiments across four farms in\u000a      South-West England. The team manipulated conventional management\u000a      practices, such as application of inorganic fertiliser, cutting frequency\u000a      and height, and aftermath grazing, to create different treatment regimes\u000a      along a gradient of decreasing management intensity.\u000a    The findings provided options for management of grasslands that enhanced\u000a      invertebrate diversity. They found that stopping the use of inorganic\u000a      fertiliser, reducing cutting frequency and grazing were all beneficial to\u000a      butterfly diversity and that sowing flower-rich habitat enhanced bumblebee\u000a      diversity [4]. Fields that had no management or received only a single\u000a      silage cut in July supported greater abundances and species richness of\u000a      beetles [5]. Planthoppers and leafhoppers had the greatest abundance and\u000a      species richness in extensively managed treatments, and were negatively\u000a      affected by frequent cutting and grazing [6].\u000a    Reading's research substantially improved understanding of how\u000a      uncultivated margins can be used to improve biodiversity, helped develop\u000a      the mechanistic basis for the work, and provided a set of potential\u000a      options for inclusion in and further development of English AES.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37270","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Route to impact\u000d\u000a      As well as being published in peer-reviewed journals, the results of the\u000d\u000a      Reading research were disseminated at public events held during regular\u000d\u000a      intervals across the EU between 2007 to 2013.

In 2010, M&amp;S launched the \"Healthier Milk\" project,\u000d\u000a      which used the research results from the University of Reading to develop\u000d\u000a      a feeding regime that reduced saturated fatty acids and increased\u000d\u000a      unsaturated fatty acids, and also reduced environmental impact by reducing\u000d\u000a      methane production by dairy cows and reducing reliance on imported\u000d\u000a      Malaysian Palm oil [a]. The University of Reading then helped M&amp;S\u000d\u000a      trial this feeding regime with milk producers, with positive results. The\u000d\u000a      outcome was the launch of a `new' reduced saturated fat milk product in\u000d\u000a      October 2011, which was not a niche product but the mainstream milk retail\u000d\u000a      offering by M&amp;S. To date, M&amp;S is the only retailer to adopt this\u000d\u000a      approach [a].\u000d\u000a    M&amp;S benefits from increased sales of milk and improved corporate\u000d\u000a        social responsibility\u000d\u000a      M&amp;S is one of the UK's leading retailers with 21 million customers\u000d\u000a      visiting its 600+ UK stores each week [a]. Since the launch of M&amp;S's\u000d\u000a      Healthier Milk in 2011, sales have increased and the relationship with\u000d\u000a      their suppliers has strengthened [a]. Also, this initiative has met\u000d\u000a      several of the pillars defined in M&amp;S's corporate sustainability plan,\u000d\u000a      known as Plan A, and has been identified as the retailer's iconic food\u000d\u000a      sustainability product [a].\u000d\u000a    The public benefits from reduced saturated fat in milk products\u000d\u000a      M&amp;S sells 75 million litres of milk to around 1.5 million customers\u000d\u000a      each year [e]. Assuming there are at least 2 people per household, this\u000d\u000a      translates to an estimated 3 million people per year in the UK benefitting\u000d\u000a      from reduced SFA\/increased unsaturated fat in their diet. Indeed, M&amp;S\u000d\u000a      have estimated that 84 tonnes of saturated fat\/year have been removed from\u000d\u000a      the diets of their customers due to the research and accordingly reduced\u000d\u000a      health risks associated with consumption of SFAs [e]. Longer term\u000d\u000a      benefits, such as improvements in risk factors for cardiovascular disease,\u000d\u000a      obesity and cancers, are yet to be realised.\u000d\u000a    Environment benefits from reduced greenhouse gas emissions and reduced\u000d\u000a        carbon footprint\u000d\u000a      M&amp;S estimates that the \"Healthier Milk\" initiative has reduced the\u000d\u000a      need for Malaysian Palm oil by 1000 tonnes per year. The reduced demand\u000d\u000a      for palm oil means fewer Malaysian rainforests converted to palm\u000d\u000a      plantations and reduced carbon emissions associated with shipping to the\u000d\u000a      UK.\u000d\u000a    Reductions in harmful greenhouse gas emissions from the 10 thousand dairy\u000d\u000a      cows producing milk for M&amp;S amount to around 66-110 million litres of\u000d\u000a      methane per annum (18-30 litres of methane less per cow per day) helping\u000d\u000a      to reduce climate change and achieve UK targets for reduced emissions.\u000d\u000a    Milk producers benefit from increased payments\u000d\u000a      Since the 2011 launch of M&amp;S's healthier milk product, milk producers\u000d\u000a      who convert to the new feeding regime have benefitted from new payment\u000d\u000a      contracts that recognise the increased costs associated with the new diet\u000d\u000a      for dairy cows [b].\u000d\u000a    Cows benefit from improved diet\u000d\u000a    Farmer's Guardian also reported that cow fertility increased and that cows\u000d\u000a    had glossier coats and were generally calmer, which all suggest improved\u000d\u000a    health and well being for the animals [b]. There are 10,000 dairy cows that\u000d\u000a    produce milk for M&amp;S, all of which have benefitted from this research.\u000d\u000a    The development of commercial milk testing for fatty acids has provided a\u000d\u000a      new dimension to quality testing of milk for the dairy industry and paved\u000d\u000a      the way for incentive payments to producers according to fatty acid\u000d\u000a      profile (see supporting Arla letter). The dairy industry and dairy farmers\u000d\u000a      more generally (i.e. in addition to those 36 dairy farmers contracted to\u000d\u000a      M&amp;S who benefit from higher milk payments from the company noted\u000d\u000a      above) have very considerably benefitted from seeing and understanding the\u000d\u000a      scope to manage fatty acids in milk production and in the dairy supply\u000d\u000a      chain (see supporting evidence from National Milk Records plc and Arla).\u000d\u000a      The research has also helped all of these companies to further their\u000d\u000a      corporate social responsibility agendas and to gain commercial advantage\u000d\u000a      (for example, see letter from Arla).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2011, an estimated 3 million UK milk consumers have benefitted each\u000d\u000a      year from research conducted at the University of Reading, which has\u000d\u000a      helped reduce saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in milk and milk products.

Consumption of SFA increases the risk of\u000d\u000a      cardiovascular disease, obesity (and the diseases and health problems\u000d\u000a      associated with obesity) and, according to mounting evidence, various\u000d\u000a      cancers (such as breast and colon cancers).

Research carried out between 2004 and 2013\u000d\u000a      at the University of Reading examined how different types and quantities\u000d\u000a      of feed affected the various SFA found in milk in different breeds of cow.\u000d\u000a      The research was led by Reading staff that have expertise specifically in\u000d\u000a      fatty acids in the food chain, ruminant physiology and health quality of\u000d\u000a      milk &#8212; Ian Givens, Professor of Food Chain Nutrition and Director of Food\u000d\u000a      Production and Quality Research Division (2003-), Chris Reynolds,\u000d\u000a      Professor of Animal and Dairy Science (2000-), Dr Kirsty Kliem, Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow (2001-) and Mr Dave Humphries Senior Research Associate and Manager\u000d\u000a      of Animal Facilities (1992-).\u000d\u000a    The role of nutrition on milk fatty acid composition\u000d\u000a      In 2008, Givens explored options for replacing some of the SFA in milk fat\u000d\u000a      with more beneficial cis- monounsaturated fatty acids through alteration\u000d\u000a      of the cow's diet. He provided preliminary evidence that changing diet was\u000d\u000a      a viable strategy for achieving health benefits for milk consumers [1].\u000d\u000a      Givens and his Reading colleagues then conducted extensive feeding trials\u000d\u000a      of dairy cattle to identify the types and quantities of UK-grown feed\u000d\u000a      (maize, rapeseed and linseed) that result in substantially reduced\u000d\u000a      quantities of the various SFAs found in milk. They tested the effects of:\u000d\u000a      replacing grass silage with maize silage [2], different forms of rape seed\u000d\u000a      (whole, milled or oil) [3], different varieties of rape oil (normal vs.\u000d\u000a      high oleic acid) [4], and the inclusion of an extruded linseed product, on\u000d\u000a      different cow breeds [5] on milk fatty acid composition.\u000d\u000a    Their studies demonstrated that including processed rapeseeds (and other\u000d\u000a      oil-rich products) in the diet of the dairy cow reduced potentially\u000d\u000a      harmful SFAs typically from 70 to 55-60% total fatty acids whilst\u000d\u000a      increasing more beneficial cis-monounsaturated fatty acids from 20 to 33%\u000d\u000a      [3], [4]. They also showed that the proportionate changes milk fatty acid\u000d\u000a      composition was different in different breeds, highlighting the importance\u000d\u000a      of considering genetic interactions [5].\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Givens and his colleagues presented results from a four year\u000d\u000a      study that assessed the persistence of changes to milk fatty acid content\u000d\u000a      in response to diet change. New innovative techniques were developed to\u000d\u000a      accurately measure the fatty acid content of milk in terms of the type of\u000d\u000a      fatty acids and their quantities. The key findings were that 1) for a\u000d\u000a      given diet imposed, changes in milk fatty acid composition were persistent\u000d\u000a      at least over the 12 week study period and 2) the milk fatty acid\u000d\u000a      composition of individual cows varied a lot but were consistently\u000d\u000a      different ie high SFA cows were always high SFA. The results are important\u000d\u000a      because they confirm that the effect of diet changes are consistent and\u000d\u000a      that there is probably a sizable genetic component to milk fatty acid\u000d\u000a      composition but we have not done anything on this.\u000d\u000a    A key product of the work was the development of clear `blue prints' in\u000d\u000a      the published literature, which defined the parameters for more\u000d\u000a      sustainable milk production with lowered SFA content.\u000d\u000a    Sustainability was related to the use of oilseeds that are grown\u000d\u000a      extensively in the UK rather than imported feed stocks such as palm oil\u000d\u000a      and the reduced amount of methane produced by the cow. Thus the production\u000d\u000a      of milk with lower SFA can be achieved whilst also reducing the\u000d\u000a      environmental impact of milk production providing beneficial impacts on\u000d\u000a      both human health and the environment [2], [6], [7]\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37274","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research at Reading into the development and evaluation of spectral\u000a      modification films has\u000a      involved a long term partnership with BPI-visqueen, with Richard Henbest\u000a      (former Technical\u000a      Director at BPI-visqueen) co-authoring many of the papers listed above.\u000a      The Reading team\u000a      provided expertise in crop physiology and designed, implemented and\u000a      analysed experiments at the\u000a      research facilities at Reading, which examined crop responses to different\u000a      film types. BPI-visqueen\u000a      provided expertise in the development and production of the plastic films.\u000a      The collaboration\u000a      resulted in several commercial products that have been on sale during the\u000a      impact period 2008-2013.\u000a      These products offer tangible advantages to growers, which differentiated\u000a      BPI-visqueen\u000a      products in the market-place.\u000a    Development and sale of new commercial products\u000a      The first product developed from the work on light scattering film [1] was\u000a      Luminance THB (Thermal\u000a      Heat Barrier), launched in 2001 and marketed as a diffusing heat control\u000a      film for polytunnels. The\u000a      research undertaken by Reading into the effects of light scattering films\u000a      provided BPI-visqueen\u000a      with a credible, scientific basis for their key communication messages and\u000a      marketing materials [a].\u000a      In 2013, Luminance continues to be a globally recognised brand of film\u000a      that BPI-visqueen sells in\u000a      over 50 countries worldwide [b]. Though specific sales figures for this\u000a      product are commercially\u000a      sensitive, in 2011 BPI-visqueen reported that more than one third of\u000a      sales, valued at &#163;508 million,\u000a      were in the agricultural sector, including their value-added agricultural\u000a      films [b, pg 18]. Luminance\u000a      THB continues to be one of the leading wide film plastic products\u000a      manufactured by BPI.Visqueen\u000a      and was the first diffuse heat control film for polytunnels &#8212; since then\u000a      other plastics companies have\u000a      developed similar products (e.g SunMaster superthermic from XL\/Plastika\u000a      Kritis).\u000a    In February 2013 BPI-visqueen launched a new product, Lumisol, which is a\u000a      greenhouse film\u000a      designed to create an optimum growing environment by actively managing UV\u000a      light [c]. The\u000a      Lumisol film range includes both clear and diffused film formats and it\u000a      was the Lumisol Diffused\u000a      product that was developed using a formulation based on Luminance\u000a      technology [c]. Therefore the\u000a      original work undertaken by Reading [1] continues to provide effective\u000a      temperature control in this\u000a      next generation of diffused horticulture films. In Lumisol, all of the UV\u000a      light is allowed through to the\u000a      plant to increase the secondary compounds in the plant, increase nutrient\u000a      quality, and improve fruit\u000a      colour and firmness [2-4] as well as promote the plants own defence\u000a      mechanisms against pests\u000a      and diseases. This is a novel approach and has been built on work\u000a      conducted by Reading [2-4]\u000a      into the effects of UV clear films on the levels of plant secondary\u000a      compounds [d].Lumisol is sold for\u000a      greenhouse applications throughout BPIs domestic and overseas markets\u000a      including Europe\u000a      (France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain) Egypt, Turkey and some African\u000a      countries.\u000a    Reading's research on UV blocking for pests and diseases [5, 6] has been\u000a      used in products and\u000a      marketing for BPI-visqueen, including Lumivar, a UV blocking film [d].\u000a      Films from manufacturers\u000a      such as Plastika Kritis, Greece, now use UV blocking as a means of\u000a      reducing pest and disease\u000a      attack in greenhouses, in part influenced by the research done at Reading\u000a      as a highly skilled\u000a      individual from the Reading team became the exports manager for Plastika\u000a      Kritis in 2007 (see\u000a      below).\u000a    Industry invests in `smart-film' technology and creates job\u000a        opportunities\u000a      BPI-visqueen's success in horticultural film led to a &#163;7 million\u000a      investment in 2008 in new\u000a      manufacturing technology at their site in Ardeer, North Ayrshire to\u000a      produce these next generation\u000a      films with \"optimum quality and efficiency levels\" and with \"increased\u000a      throughput and quicker\u000a      turnaround times\" [e]. This investment provided 40 additional jobs in the\u000a      Scottish community of\u000a      Ardeer [e].\u000a    Advanced films enhance export sales\u000a      The benefits provided by Luminance have enabled BPI-visqueen to export\u000a      successfully into a\u000a      variety of overseas markets thanks to its unique advantages over standard,\u000a      locally available films.\u000a    The Sales Director at BPI-Visqueen said that \"working with Reading has\u000a        allowed BPI-visqueen to\u000a        advance films from being merely covers that protect crops from the\u000a        elements to a range of spectral\u000a        filters that add significant value to the grower. Reading helped us to\u000a        develop our range in a\u000a        methodical, scientific manner that gave us a head-start in the\u000a        marketplace with temperature control\u000a        films. This allowed us to compete at an international level which in\u000a        turn has enhanced our export\u000a        sales\" [f].'\u000a    New films increase strawberry production in the UK\u000a      The strawberry industry has seen a steady increase in production and\u000a      market value since the\u000a      widespread use of light diffusing, heat retaining and other spectrally\u000a      specific films [g]. Between\u000a      1991 and 2001, the average production of strawberries in the UK was 66.3\u000a      thousand tonnes [h,\u000a      table 10]. In 2002, after the introduction of Luminance THB, total\u000a      strawberry yield increased to 77.9\u000a      thousand tonnes and has steadily increased ever since [h, table 10]. Total\u000a      production in 2012\u000a      (provisional) was 145.1 thousand tonnes, nearly a 5% increase over\u000a      production in 2008 [h, table\u000a      10]. In 2011, the National Horticultural Forum acknowledged the\u000a      contribution of the collaborative\u000a      research conducted by the University of Reading and BPI-visqueen to these\u000a      improved yields[g, pg\u000a      3]. The development and commercialisation of novel films has helped extend\u000a      the British strawberry\u000a      growing season from eight weeks to one that now stretches from Spring to\u000a      Autumn. Although there\u000a      are many factors responsible for increased strawberry yields in the UK,\u000a      Reading's research into\u000a      spectral films has been one of the contributing factors.\u000a    Highly skilled people trained at Reading take expertise to other\u000a        companies\u000a      Postdoctoral researchers and PhD students who worked on research into\u000a      spectral modification\u000a      films at Reading are now working at horticultural film\/polythene companies\u000a      and are using their\u000a      knowledge on spectral films to improve their company's performance.

Horticultural crops, particularly soft fruit species, are grown\u000a      increasingly in polytunnels\u000a      and greenhouses since these allow the UK production season to be\u000a      increased, whilst reducing\u000a      pesticide use and harvest costs. At the time this research began in 1994,\u000a      most crops were grown\u000a      under clear standard polythene. Researchers at Reading began investigating\u000a      the effects on plant\u000a      growth and development of polythene films that modify the spectral\u000a      characteristics of light passing\u000a      through as published evidence suggested that certain modifications could\u000a      significantly improve\u000a      yield and quality of crops grown in polytunnels.\u000a    In 1995, Hadley and his colleagues found that additives could be\u000a      incorporated into polyethylene\u000a      films, which scattered a high proportion of light, allowing very little\u000a      transmission of direct beam light\u000a      and reducing transmission of infra-red compared to standard films [1]. The\u000a      light scattering films\u000a      transmitted the light wavelengths used for photosynthesis in diffuse form\u000a      allowing light to hit the\u000a      plant from all angles and giving better plant illumination. This increased\u000a      rates of photosynthesis\u000a      and improved growth compared to plants growth under direct beam light\u000a      under standard films.\u000a    As a result of this initial work, Hadley began a relationship with\u000a      BPI-visqueen, Europe's largest\u000a      manufacturer of polythene film products, to develop a range of novel\u000a      spectral modification films for\u000a      the horticultural industry. In 1997, with the support of a LINK grant [7],\u000a      the Reading team produced\u000a      a range of additives and experimental plastics, which BPI-visqueen then\u000a      produced in experimental\u000a      amounts to use in a series of growing trials designed to evaluate the\u000a      films for their effect on plant\u000a      growth and disease. Films with light scattering, UV clear and UV blocking\u000a      properties were identified\u000a      and further research, funded by grants [8-9] and BPI-visqueen directly (4\u000a      PhD projects in total),\u000a      evaluated the effect of these films on plant growth, pests and diseases,\u000a      and further refined the\u000a      stability of the films for commercial production.\u000a    Light scattering films control heat\u000a      Controlling temperatures in polytunnels and greenhouses is difficult and\u000a      in hot summer months\u000a      there is a serious risk of crops being damaged by scorching.The light\u000a      scattering film that was\u000a      developed [1] not only improves plant growth and yield, it reduces the\u000a      amount of heat generated.\u000a      As well as scattering the light wavelengths used by plants, the film\u000a      scatters longer wavelengths &#8212;\u000a      infra-red radiation &#8212; not used in photosynthesis. It is largely infra-red\u000a      radiation that heats the\u000a      polytunnel, but when these longer wavelengths are scattered, less\u000a      radiation enters the tunnel,\u000a      significantly reducing the temperature compared to standard polythene\u000a      films.\u000a    UV clear films increase nutrient content and fruit\u000a      Previous research had indicated that plants grown under high UV radiation\u000a      contain increased\u000a      levels of secondary products. Plant secondary compounds are beneficial to\u000a      human health\u000a      (increased nutritional value) and also form part of the plant's natural\u000a      defences to pests and\u000a      diseases. Therefore, growing plants under films that allow UV light\u000a      through &#8212; UV clear films &#8212; could\u000a      improve nutrient content as well as plant resistance to pests and disease.\u000a      Standard horticultural\u000a      films contain UV absorbing compounds that protect the film from UV\u000a      breakdown, but collaborative\u000a      work between Reading and BPI led to the development of a UV clear film.\u000a      The Reading team\u000a      showed that growing lettuce under UV clear films gave increased levels of\u000a      plant secondary\u000a      compounds including phenolics and anthocyanins [2, 3]. They also looked at\u000a      the effect of UV\u000a      radiation on fruit secondary compounds in one of the main commercial\u000a      varieties of strawberry,\u000a      Elsanta, and found that it hastened the rate of colour development and\u000a      gave increased levels of\u000a      anthocyanin, flavonoid and phenolic compounds at the time of harvesting\u000a      [4]. Plants also produce\u000a      greater numbers of firmer strawberries under UV clear films compared to UV\u000a      opaque films [4].\u000a    UV blocking films control diseases and pests\u000a      While UV light has a number of benefits for the plants, it's also\u000a      beneficial to the diseases and pests\u000a      that affect the plants. Many fungi, such as Botrytis cineria (grey\u000a      mould), need UV light to produce\u000a      spores and insects use UV light to navigate and forage for food; films\u000a      that block UV light could help\u000a      control fungal diseases and pests. In 2000, Hadley and his colleagues at\u000a      Reading reported that UV\u000a      blocking films led to reduction in the production of B. cineria\u000a      spores in vitro and that in field trials,\u000a      the incidence of B. cineria in strawberries was reduced by 26%\u000a      compared to standard films [5].\u000a      Field and behavioural experiments showed that fewer insect pests (aphids,\u000a      thrips and beetles)\u000a      were found under UV blocking films [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37275","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research leads to significant industry investment\u000a      Spencer's pioneering research on flavonoids and their benefits attracted\u000a      significant investment by\u000a      leading US food manufacturers.

Professor\u000a      Jeremy Spencer, has pioneered research, first at King's College London\u000a      (2002-2004) and more\u000a      recently at the University of Reading (2004-2007, Lecturer, 2007-2010\u000a      Reader; 2010-current\u000a      Professor), into how the human body absorbs and metabolises flavanols, and\u000a      the impact they have\u000a      on cardiovascular function. His research has added to a growing body of\u000a      evidence suggesting that\u000a      a diet rich in flavanols can have a positive impact on circulatory,\u000a      cardiovascular and\u000a      gastrointestinal (GI) tract health. Much of the early work on the role of\u000a      flavanols in health focused\u000a      on the antioxidant properties of these compounds and their potential role\u000a      in attenuating pro-oxidant\u000a      pathophysiological processes that underlie atherosclerosis and many\u000a      cancers. Spencer's research\u000a      at King's College London provided some of the first evidence that\u000a      flavanols and other flavonoids\u000a      exerted beneficial effects via non-antioxidant mechanisms [1]. This\u000a      research indicated that the\u000a      flavanol epicatechin, found in cocoa, berries, apple and wine, and its\u000a      human metabolites (i.e. those\u000a      forms of epicatechin found in the circulation after consumption) were\u000a      effective at preventing\u000a      oxidative-injury to cells, not via their role as classical antioxidants,\u000a        but rather by direct interaction\u000a        with cellular signalling pathways. Presentation of these results at\u000a      international conferences\u000a      prompted initial discussions with the American global food manufacturer\u000a      Mars, Inc. regarding\u000a      collaborative research potential.\u000a    Human absorption and metabolism of CocoaVia: identifying optimal\u000a        delivery of flavanols\u000a    In 2004, when Spencer joined Reading as Lecturer in Nutritional\u000a      Biochemistry, discussions with\u000a      Mars, Inc. developed into a direct collaboration between the company and\u000a      the university. Mars,\u000a      Inc., which has conducted decades of research on cocoa flavanols and holds\u000a      numerous patents for\u000a      processing cocoa in a way that preserves flavanols, invested &#163;400,000 over\u000a      the period 2005-2013\u000a      to support a core research laboratory at Reading. Research on human\u000a      absorption and metabolism\u000a      of an early formulation of Mars' flavanol-containing product CocoaVia\u000a      began in 2005, with the aim\u000a      of understanding how flavanols are taken-up and utilised in different\u000a      parts of the body, in particular\u000a      the vascular system, gut and brain. Whilst CocoaVia had proved highly\u000a      effective in improving\u000a      health biomarkers such as vascular function, further promotion of the\u000a      product on the basis of its\u000a      health effects was limited by the fact that cocoa is a high fat, high\u000a      sugar-containing product, which\u000a      could counteract the beneficial effects of the flavanols. In 2009, Spencer\u000a      and his colleagues began\u000a      collaboration with Mars, Inc to specifically look at the impact of\u000a      different types of sugars on flavanol\u000a      absorption. This showed that although sucrose promoted flavanol absorption\u000a      to a greater extent\u000a      than did the calorie free maltitol, the differences in uptake were not\u000a      large [2]. This research\u000a      informed the development of a novel flavanol-containing drink that was\u000a      both low in sucrose (sugar)\u000a      and fat, called Cirku.\u000a    First evidence that flavanols affect microbial community in the gut of\u000a        humans\u000a      Further industry investment in 2007 supported investigations at Reading\u000a      into the health effects of\u000a      CocoaVia. As the majority of cocoa flavanols are passed through to the\u000a      large intestine, it was\u000a      hypothesised that they may be metabolised by resident microbiota, thereby\u000a      encouraging the\u000a      growth of some beneficial gut bacteria. In 2011, Spencer and Gibson\u000a      (Professor Gut Microbiology,\u000a      University of Reading, 1998- current), showed for the first time that\u000a      consumption of cocoa flavanols\u000a      could indeed significantly affect the growth of select gut microflora in\u000a      humans, suggesting it did\u000a      have potential prebiotic benefits [3].\u000a    Flavanol-rich foods improve human cognition, vascular system health\u000a        and digestive health\u000a      Research carried out between 2007 and 2011, funded by Mars Inc. and by\u000a      BBSRC [7,8], and using\u000a      animal models of disease and human intervention studies, indicated that\u000a      flavanol-rich foods,\u000a      including Cirku and blueberry, were effective in improving cognitive and\u000a      vascular function\/health\u000a      [3,4]. Spencer and his colleagues also provided concurrent supporting data\u000a      that flavanols, present\u000a      in blueberry were effective in acutely improving vascular function in\u000a      healthy men in a time- and\u000a      intake-dependent manner and that these benefits were mechanistically\u000a      linked to the actions of\u000a      circulating phenolic metabolites on neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity [5].\u000a    Linking flavanols to improvements in memory and cognition\u000a      While research from the University of Reading and elsewhere had provided\u000a      evidence that\u000a      flavonoid-rich foods were capable of improving memory and cognition in\u000a      humans and other\u000a      animals, it was still not clear whether flavonoids were the agents that\u000a      caused the observed effects.\u000a      In 2012\/3, Spencer and his colleagues supplemented healthy rats with pure\u000a      anthocyanins or pure\u000a      flavanols (at levels found in both cocoa and blueberry) for six weeks.\u000a      They found that spatial\u000a      memory was enhanced in 18 month old rats, along with evidence of\u000a      activation of signalling\u000a      pathways linking to synaptic plasticity. These data supported the claim\u000a      that it is these flavonoids\u000a      that are the likely causal agents in mediating the cognitive effects of\u000a      cocoa, blueberry and other\u000a      flavonoid-rich foods [6].\u000a    Evidence that Cirku has cardiovascular benefits\u000a      In 2009, the European Commission funded research to provide\u000a      proof-of-concept to the claim that\u000a      Cirku helps support cardiovascular health by helping support healthy\u000a      circulation and blood flow to\u000a      the heart, brain, eye, muscle and skin health [9]. The collaborative\u000a      project, named FLAVIOLA\u000a      (www.flaviola.org), involved the\u000a      Universities of Reading, Dusseldorf, Gent, Maastricht and\u000a      Karolinska and INRA in France, with Spencer at Reading. Spencer's role in\u000a      the studies was to\u000a      develop an understanding of how flavanol absorption, distribution,\u000a      metabolism and excretion\u000a      (ADME) varies in different individuals within the general population and\u000a      how these differences\u000a      influence vascular health potential. Notably factors such as inter- and\u000a      intra-individual difference in\u000a      ADME, age, gender and background diet were investigated. The research\u000a      consortium showed\u000a      flavanols from Cirku were effectively absorbed, were delivered to the\u000a      vascular system, and induced\u000a      medically significant improvements in blood pressure and blood flow both\u000a      acutely (1 day) and\u000a      chronically (4 weeks) in different individuals (age, sex, background diet\u000a      etc.). A number of\u000a      manuscripts are currently submitted for publication and the data presented\u000a      at conferences are\u000a      available on the web site.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37277","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    About half of the world's population eats rice daily. Climate change\u000d\u000a      presents a major challenge to global rice producing regions by threatening\u000d\u000a      yields, farmer livelihoods and food security. Modelling studies published\u000d\u000a      in 1997 by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) showed that\u000d\u000a      climate change could reduce Asian rice production by almost 4% by the\u000d\u000a      middle of the 21st century, at a time when population growth will increase\u000d\u000a      consumer demand. For example, demand for rice could increase from 524\u000d\u000a      million tonnes now to 700 million tonnes by 2025. When theoretical\u000d\u000a      heat-tolerant varieties were included in the IRRI simulations, rice yields\u000d\u000a      across Asia under climate change were restored to their normal levels. The\u000d\u000a      research at Reading demonstrated the nature and importance of the heat\u000d\u000a      stress response in rice and other crops in practice and is making\u000d\u000a      theoretical heat-tolerant varieties a reality through its screening\u000d\u000a      protocols.\u000d\u000a    New rice screening protocols adopted by breeders and IRRI\u000d\u000a    Rice breeders became interested in the Reading team's phenotyping\u000d\u000a      protocols [5] following a presentation at a conference in Wuhan, China in\u000d\u000a      2007. The Reading protocols were subsequently incorporated into the\u000d\u000a      testing procedures of the International Rice Heat Tolerance Nurseries\u000d\u000a      (IRHTN) of the IRRI &#8212; a non-profit independent research and training\u000d\u000a      organization located in the Philippines. The Director General of IRRI\u000d\u000a      stated that \"scientists at IRRI modified [Reading's] screening protocol\u000d\u000a      and put it out for use by plant breeders through the International Rice\u000d\u000a      High Temperature Network\" [a]. The breeding team at IRHTN distributes a\u000d\u000a      range of different rice accessions to all rice-producing countries across\u000d\u000a      Asia and Africa. The most promising are then tested for heat tolerance\u000d\u000a      using a simplified version of the Reading screening protocol. Evidence is\u000d\u000a      provided from three example breeders in India who have adopted the new\u000d\u000a      protocol [b-d].\u000d\u000a    The IRRI is also investing in an advanced breeding programme for heat\u000d\u000a      tolerance based on Reading's identification of a heat tolerant rice\u000d\u000a      accession (N22) in 2008. These nurseries have also confirmed the\u000d\u000a      heat-tolerance trait that Reading researchers identified in a different\u000d\u000a      genetic background (N22 x IR64 and others) and have tested the mapping\u000d\u000a      populations for high temperature tolerance under control chambers, again\u000d\u000a      using the Reading protocol.\u000d\u000a    Thus, Reading research has enabled rice breeders internationally to\u000d\u000a      undertake crop selection programs so that rice growers around the world\u000d\u000a      can better adapt to the temperature demands of climate change and be able\u000d\u000a      to maintain or improve yields to help feed growing populations in Asia and\u000d\u000a      Africa. The immediate impact of the Reading research is on the\u000d\u000a      pre-breeding of rice for future climates, with ultimate benefits in the\u000d\u000a      form of new rice varieties for millions of growers globally, helping to\u000d\u000a      maintain yields, protect farmer livelihoods and food security.\u000d\u000a    Research informs international policy on climate change\u000d\u000a    In 2007, the Stern Review of The Economics of Climate Change used\u000d\u000a      figures of the temperature stress effect derived from Reading's crop\u000d\u000a      research data in relation to wheat and peanut varieties [e]. Although this\u000d\u000a      review was published prior to 2008, it remains one of the largest and most\u000d\u000a      widely known and discussed reports of its kind, and continued to be\u000d\u000a      greatly influential over the 2008-2013 period, remaining a subject of\u000d\u000a      debate in UK politics, e.g., [f-g].\u000d\u000a    The 2012 World Bank publication `Turn down the heat' includes the\u000d\u000a      high temperature stress effect in the Executive Summary [h] due to the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research at Reading. This document, and the Reading research,\u000d\u000a      was used to support the inclusion of climate change in the top-level\u000d\u000a      Sustainability Goal of the World Bank Group [i, pg 31] which has\u000d\u000a      underpinned World Bank strategy and activities globally. In this way, the\u000d\u000a      Reading research has contributed to the acceptance of the importance of\u000d\u000a      climate change in policy agendas because of demonstration of its effects\u000d\u000a      on crop yields, food security and sustainability. It has provided robust\u000d\u000a      evidence to support the positions of international organisations working\u000d\u000a      on climate change.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Heat tolerant rice varieties, which are better adapted to predicted\u000d\u000a      climate change scenarios, are critical for the future livelihood of\u000d\u000a      millions of rice growers and for the 50% of the global population that\u000d\u000a      depends on rice as a staple in their daily diet.

Since around this time,\u000d\u000a      Tim Wheeler, Professor of Crop Science, School of Agriculture, Policy and\u000d\u000a      Development, University of Reading (1994 &#8212; present), has been\u000d\u000a      investigating how climate change could impact on the sustainability of\u000d\u000a      agriculture and food security, together with Reading colleagues Richard\u000d\u000a      Ellis (Professor of Crop Production, 1977-present), Paul Hadley (Professor\u000d\u000a      of Horticulture, 1977-present) and later Peter Craufurd (Senior Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow,1997-2009) Krishna Jagadish (PhD scholar, 1999-2002) and Madan Pal\u000d\u000a      Singh (Royal Society India Fellow, 2006-2007).\u000d\u000a    Identified effect of temperature variability on crop yield\u000d\u000a    In 1996, Wheeler and colleagues discovered for the first time that in\u000d\u000a      addition to mean temperature warming, temperature variability must also be\u000d\u000a      considered when trying to quantify the impacts of future climates on crop\u000d\u000a      yields [1]. Using extensive plant experiments in controlled custom-built\u000d\u000a      environment facilities, Wheeler found that episodes of hot temperatures\u000d\u000a      (&gt;32oC) that coincided with the flowering of annual crops\u000d\u000a      drastically reduced the grain yield of wheat, and that these effects far\u000d\u000a      exceeded those of a small mean temperature warming [2]. Indeed, Wheeler\u000d\u000a      and colleagues showed that a period of high temperature for as little as\u000d\u000a      30-60 minutes in duration could reduce yields by anything from 50% up to\u000d\u000a      100% if it coincided with a key point in the growth of the crop, such as\u000d\u000a      flowering. This effect of brief periods of high temperature on crop yields\u000d\u000a      was previously unknown in the crop science community.\u000d\u000a    Further experimental research conducted at Reading quantified the\u000d\u000a      threshold temperature tolerated by wheat, rice, soybean and peanut\u000d\u000a      (groundnut) crops. Wheeler and his colleagues looked at responses of\u000d\u000a      groundnuts &#8212; a crop often exposed to temperatures in excess of 40oC\u000d\u000a      &#8212; to short periods of exposure to high temperatures [3] [7]. They found\u000d\u000a      that plants exposed to short, high-temperature episodes during the day\u000d\u000a      produced fewer pods. These findings, along with an extensive review of\u000d\u000a      existing evidence, led them to conclude that changes in the frequency of\u000d\u000a      hot temperatures, which are associated with warmer mean climates, were\u000d\u000a      critical to the annual yield of seed crops [4]. Understanding how crop\u000d\u000a      yields are affected by temperature fluctuations, particularly very short\u000d\u000a      high temperature events, independent of any substantial changes in mean\u000d\u000a      seasonal temperature, was an important discovery in the context of\u000d\u000a      predicting the likely impacts of climate change [8] [9]. This improved\u000d\u000a      understanding is helping identify, breed and grow heat tolerant crop\u000d\u000a      varieties to mitigate reduced yields in the face of climate change.\u000d\u000a    Developed protocols to screen for heat tolerance traits in crops\u000d\u000a    Beginning in 2003, the Reading team started to identify plant traits\u000d\u000a      associated with heat-tolerance and they developed new and robust\u000d\u000a      internationally-applicable protocols for screening wheat, rice, soybean\u000d\u000a      and peanut crop varieties for heat tolerance [5]. They conducted\u000d\u000a      experiments at optimum and high air temperatures using parents of some\u000d\u000a      prominent mapping populations of rice (Oryza sativa L.) to\u000d\u000a      determine a potential heat avoidance mechanism as well as to identify\u000d\u000a      genotypes with a true heat tolerance during the flowering period [5].\u000d\u000a      Their research showed that the effects of temperature on the timing of\u000d\u000a      flowering (heat avoidance) could be separated out from effects on the\u000d\u000a      pollination process itself (heat tolerance), which allowed them to develop\u000d\u000a      a screening method that identified true heat tolerance in crop varieties\u000d\u000a      [5]. The N22 rice variety was the most heat tolerant rice genotype [5]\u000d\u000a      [10]. The team then screened a population of 181 recombinant inbred lines\u000d\u000a      of a tolerant rice cultivar x susceptible cultivar cross for heat\u000d\u000a      tolerance [6]. They identified quantitative trait loci associated with\u000d\u000a      heat tolerance during flowering, which were in similar positions on the\u000d\u000a      chromosomes as other loci associated with stress tolerance such as\u000d\u000a      drought, cold and salinity; this suggested that there were common\u000d\u000a      underlying stress-responsive regions of the rice genome [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37285","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2245662","Name":"Senegal"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates\u000a      that the world needs to produce 60% more food by the year 2030. Increased\u000a      production is needed to support a growing global human population and to\u000a      accommodate changes in diet. However, our ability to maintain, let alone\u000a      increase, food production will be hindered by climate change; under a\u000a      `business as usual' scenario, levels of global productivity will steadily\u000a      decline. Food security is further threatened by the negative impacts of\u000a      extreme weather, which is expected to become more frequent. The University\u000a      of Reading's work on crops and climate change has informed international\u000a      policy related to measures to safeguard global food security by: i)\u000a      providing evidence to support the UK Government's position in\u000a      international climate change discussions, ii) providing key evidence for\u000a      the 2010 United Nations 16th Conference of the Parties\u000a      (COP-16), iii) developing new tools to support the training of farmers,\u000a      researchers and policy makers in the developing world, and iv) supporting\u000a      the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food &amp;\u000a      Agriculture.\u000a    i) Advising UK Government\u000a    The GLAM crop simulation model has been used by Reading researchers to\u000a      explore the impact of a range of potential climate change mitigation\u000a      policies on crop production to inform policy decisions through the AVOID\u000a      programme.\u000a    The results of Reading's work on crop productivity, together with\u000a      projections of other potential impacts undertaken by collaborators within\u000a      the AVOID programme, have been made available to DECC. These outputs have\u000a      included reports for DECC as well as presentations, posters and\u000a      information leaflets at key global conferences and meetings for policy\u000a      makers such as the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP-15)\u000a      in Copenhagen, a pre-COP-16 briefing in Cancun in 2010, and the Planet\u000a      Under Pressure conference in London 2012 (over 3000 delegates plus 3,500\u000a      virtual delegates on the web). According to an independent review of the\u000a      AVOID programme \"the programme's outputs have been used by policy makers\u000a      in DECC and other areas of government\" [a, pg 4] and have \"helped frame\u000a      the UK position at negotiations and the Committee on Climate Change's work\u000a      on long term targets to 2050\" [a, pg 4]. The AVOID outputs were used as\u000a      part of the evidence for the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2012, which\u000a      is \"a major piece of evidence in Defra\" [a, pg 6].\u000a    Reading research has also fed into the Commission on Sustainable\u000a      Agriculture and Climate Change [b, cites 4], which was chaired by the UK's\u000a      Chief Scientific Adviser at the time, Professor Sir John Beddington. Sir\u000a      John has used outputs from both AVOID and the research of the Commission\u000a      as a source for speeches to a variety of audiences [a, pg 5].\u000a    ii) Evidence for international agreements adopted at COP-16\u000a    The GLAM crop model simulations were incorporated into evidence that was\u000a      distributed to approximately 15,000 delegates at the 16th\u000a      Conference of the Parties (COP-16) to the United Nations Framework\u000a      Convention on Climate Change at Cancun, Mexico in 2010 [c]. The evidence\u000a      presented in information packs demonstrated the potential impacts of\u000a      mitigated and unmitigated climate change, including the crop impact data\u000a      from Reading. This included a comparison of impacts at 2f0b0C and 4f0b0C\u000a      global warming.\u000a    The outcome of COP-16 was an agreement adopted by the states' parties.\u000a      The agreement recognized that climate change represents an urgent and\u000a      potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, which\u000a      needs to be urgently addressed. The agreement further recognized that deep\u000a      cuts in global greenhouse emissions are required to hold the increase in\u000a      global average temperature below 2f0b0C above pre-industrial levels, and\u000a      that parties should take urgent action to meet this long-term goal,\u000a      consistent with the science. The outcome of COP-16 and the agreement to\u000a      hold global average temperature at the 2f0b0C level was built upon a wide\u000a      body of scientific evidence, which included the Reading evidence on\u000a      impacts of climate change scenarios on crop productivity. Whilst it is not\u000a      possible to attribute the outcome to any one source of information,\u000a      research from Reading made a material contribution to the larger body of\u000a      evidence that informed the decision making.\u000a    iii) Climate Analogue Tool used for training policy makers, farmers\u000a        and researchers in the developing world\u000a    The Climate Analogue Tool has been, and continues to be, implemented\u000a      through CCAFS. CCAFS has used the tool to support training of regional\u000a      partners in the developing world, including National Agricultural Research\u000a      Systems, Non-Governmental Organizations, and policy makers. The Tool is\u000a      informing the development of adaptation strategies to projected climates,\u000a      by ground-proofing abstract climate projections using comparisons based on\u000a      present-day conditions. This allows potential options for adaptation to be\u000a      identified based on existing agricultural practices in the locations where\u000a      current climates are comparable with the projected future climate of the\u000a      region of interest. Training and dissemination events for the Tool have\u000a      been held in Nepal, Senegal, Kenya (August 2012) and Ethiopia (October\u000a      2012). This has also led to farmer-to-farmer exchange visits among\u000a      climatic analogue locations, enabling individual farmers to learn from\u000a      their peers about potential strategies to cope with their future climatic\u000a      constraints [d].\u000a    The Tool has also been used to support farmer-to-farmer exchanges among\u000a      climatic analogue locations, through the CCAFS Farms for the Future\u000a      initiative. Farmers have already benefitted from the opportunity to learn\u000a      from their peers about potential strategies and practices to cope with\u000a      their future climatic constraints [d]. To date, Farms for the Future has\u000a      facilitated exchanges for partners from Nepal, Ethiopia, Tanzania and\u000a      Costa Rica.\u000a    iv) Supporting the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for\u000a        Food &amp; Agriculture\u000a    The Climate Analogue Tool is supporting policy implementation of the\u000a      International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.\u000a      No country is self-sufficient in plant genetic resources, and all depend\u000a      on genetic diversity in crops from other countries and regions.\u000a      International cooperation and the open exchange of genetic resources are\u000a      therefore essential for food security. The fair sharing of benefits\u000a      arising from the use of these resources is being proactively implemented\u000a      at the international level through the Treaty and its Standard Material\u000a      Transfer Agreement. The Tool is being used by Biodiversity International\u000a      to demonstrate the benefits of the Treaty and associated policies, and to\u000a      locate areas that need urgent conservation.\u000a    The scientist leading the Treaty implementation project for Biodiversity\u000a      International, is quoted on the CCAFS website as saying \"Our work\u000a        helping countries implement the Treaty dovetails beautifully with the\u000a        Climate Analogue Tool, and use of the tool will be mainstreamed into the\u000a        research supported by the project\" [e].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A novel large-area process-based crop simulation model developed at the\u000a      University of Reading and published in 2004 has been used to explore how\u000a      climate change may affect crop production and global food security.

Wheeler\u000a      and his colleagues conducted extensive plant experiments in custom built\u000a      controlled environment facilities to measure the effects of changes in key\u000a      climate change parameters (with particular attention given to changes in\u000a      temperature) on plant development and growth for a number of key crops\u000a      including rice, wheat, groundnuts and soybean.\u000a    Development of a novel large-area process-based crop simulation model\u000a    The Reading team used these research findings in conjunction with other\u000a      available data to develop a new process-based crop simulation model that\u000a      enabled the simulation of climate impacts on crop yield at a global scale.\u000a      Reading's Dr Andy Challinor (Senior Research Fellow, 2005-2007), joint\u000a      appointment between the School of Agriculture, Policy and Development\u000a      &amp; the Department of Meteorology) and Wheeler, together with colleagues\u000a      in the University's Department of Meteorology, developed a method for\u000a      combining weather and crop yield forecasting systems. To do this, the team\u000a      had to overcome a disparity in spatial scales as crop models generally\u000a      perform well at the field scale, while climate models operate at regional\u000a      and global scales. Using observational weather and yield data for\u000a      groundnut in India recorded from 1966 to1990, they established a working\u000a      spatial scale of an order comparable with the resolution of regional and\u000a      general circulation models of climate. In 2004, they published the design\u000a      and optimisation of this novel crop model, named GLAM (General Large Area\u000a      Model), which was developed so that it could easily be extended to any\u000a      annual crop for the investigation of the impacts of climate variability on\u000a      crop yield over large areas [3].\u000a    Wheeler and his colleagues subsequently developed new parameter sets for\u000a      GLAM based upon their experimental studies on crop responses to\u000a      variability in CO2, temperature and water availability. Their\u000a      work has helped improve understanding of the circumstances under which\u000a      different abiotic stresses dominate and has helped to quantify the\u000a      uncertainty inherent in the paramaterisation of crop growth and\u000a      development [4]. The Reading team, including Dr Hooker (Post-doctoral\u000a      Research Fellow, 2008-2012), Dr Osborne (Research Scientist, 2005-2008)\u000a      and Dr Rose (Teaching Fellow, 2008-present) also demonstrated the\u000a      uncertainty introduced to a crop impact assessment as a result of using\u000a      different climate General Circulation Models (GCMs) [5].\u000a    Application of GLAM\u000a    The GLAM crop model went on to be used as part of the AVOID research\u000a      programme, which is funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change\u000a      (DECC) and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and\u000a      aims to provide key advice to the UK Government on avoiding dangerous\u000a      climate change brought on by greenhouse gas emissions. The Reading team\u000a      contributed to the AVOID programme by using GLAM to examine the impact\u000a      that potential climate change mitigation policies may have on crops by\u000a      comparing global yield of key crops in mitigated and unmitigated scenarios\u000a      [6]. The GLAM model has been used by others elsewhere to run simulations\u000a      for crops growing under different climate change scenarios across the\u000a      world, in order to understand how they would respond to projected\u000a      environmental change and to highlight specific vulnerabilities to climate\u000a      change and the potential benefits of mitigation or adaptation strategies.\u000a    Development of a new Climate Analogue Tool\u000a    As an alternative but complementary approach to informing agricultural\u000a      adaptation to climate change, the knowledge and datasets from the GLAM\u000a      global modelling work were used by the Reading team to develop a tool to\u000a      identify sites or time periods that experience statistically similar\u000a      climates - known as analogue climates. This work was undertaken as part of\u000a      the Climate Change, Agriculture &amp; Food Security (CCAFS) programme of\u000a      the global Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research\u000a      (CGIAR), in collaboration with the International Center for Tropical\u000a      Agriculture, and the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Leeds.\u000a      This novel approach provides useful insights and practical knowledge to\u000a      support the evaluation and formulation of agricultural adaptation options\u000a      and strategies. Reading researchers developed both the original idea for\u000a      the Climate Analogue Tool and the coding foundation for core functions\u000a      within the software package. Collaborators then further developed the\u000a      software and validated it by applying it to various case studies.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37286","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Industry invests in research\u000d\u000a    Pioneering research findings from Reading [1] generated enormous\u000d\u000a      worldwide interest from industry and from government departments concerned\u000d\u000a      with food safety and health. Recognition of the impact of this research\u000d\u000a      resulted in significant funding for further research. Initially a\u000d\u000a      consortium of major food companies (Cadbury, Cereal Partners, Danone,\u000d\u000a      McCain, Ryvita, United Biscuits) funded a collaborative research\u000d\u000a      programme, led by Reading, in conjunction with the Universities of Leeds\u000d\u000a      and Nottingham. A 3-year BBSRC LINK project on minimising acrylamide in\u000d\u000a      potato products also received significant funding from food and\u000d\u000a      agriculture companies (ConAgra, Higgins Agriculture, Kettle Foods,\u000d\u000a      PepsiCo, Tesco, United Biscuits). Individual companies have also sponsored\u000d\u000a      shorter-term research at Reading, while other major grants have been\u000d\u000a      provided by BBSRC, Food Standards Agency and the EU.\u000d\u000a    Reading has, therefore, played a pivotal role in bringing together\u000d\u000a      researchers in the UK, initially the Universities of Reading, Leeds and\u000d\u000a      Nottingham and, later, Rothamsted Research and James Hutton Institute. The\u000d\u000a      outcomes of this collaborative research have had significant impact on the\u000d\u000a      approaches taken by the food industry all across the world for acrylamide\u000d\u000a      reduction.\u000d\u000a    Manufacturers adopt mitigation strategies\u000d\u000a      All large food companies preparing snack foods, biscuits, bread, coffee\u000d\u000a      and similar carbohydrate-rich foods have undertaken studies of their own\u000d\u000a      products. These approaches, taken towards mitigation, were based on our\u000d\u000a      initial finding that acrylamide is formed though the Maillard reaction\u000d\u000a      involving asparagine and reducing sugars in the food. European food\u000d\u000a      manufacturers have freely shared their findings and have produced a\u000d\u000a      \"Toolbox\", hosted on the FoodDrinkEurope website, which recommends\u000d\u000a      strategies for reducing acrylamide formation in different foods [a]. This\u000d\u000a      collaboration reflects the seriousness of the concern amongst food\u000d\u000a      manufacturers to mitigate acrylamide and the acceptance of our research by\u000d\u000a      the International community.\u000d\u000a    The Food and Drink Federation report that there has been a significant\u000d\u000a      impact of these mitigation strategies on acrylamide in food products with\u000d\u000a      reductions of 30-40% in potato crisps, 15% in potato fries, and 75% in\u000d\u000a      crispbread [b]. An analysis of over 40,000 acrylamide determinations in\u000d\u000a      commercial potato crisps from European countries showed a 50% reduction in\u000d\u000a      acrylamide levels from 2002 to 2011 [c].\u000d\u000a    Whilst the food industry has adopted strategies for lowering acrylamide\u000d\u000a      through modifying food processing, many manufacturers remain vulnerable to\u000d\u000a      fluctuations in the acrylamide-forming potential of the crops. Developing\u000d\u000a      best practice for cultivation of particular crops, alongside variety\u000d\u000a      selection and improvement, has an important part to play in acrylamide\u000d\u000a      reduction strategies. In this context, Reading's collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Rothamsted Research, has investigated the lowering of acrylamide\u000d\u000a      precursors in cereals and potatoes This has impacted on the understanding\u000d\u000a      of agronomic and genetic factors affecting asparagine and sugar levels in\u000d\u000a      cereals and potatoes and their influence on acrylamide. The impact also\u000d\u000a      extends to crop producers, where research is leading to increased\u000d\u000a      awareness of how plant varieties and agronomy methods relate to acrylamide\u000d\u000a      formation [d].\u000d\u000a    Evidence in USA legal actions\u000d\u000a      In 2005 the State of California initiated action against major\u000d\u000a      manufacturers of potato crisps (chips) and French fries alleging they\u000d\u000a      \"violated a State requirement that companies post warning labels on\u000d\u000a      products with carcinogens\". In 2008, Mottram acted as an expert witness in\u000d\u000a      the court proceedings, providing evidence that helped the court to reach\u000d\u000a      an appropriate and realistic judgement in which the companies agreed to\u000d\u000a      pay a combined US$3 million in fines and reduce the levels of acrylamide\u000d\u000a      in their products over three years rather than having all potato products\u000d\u000a      known to contain acrylamide carrying a health warning [e].\u000d\u000a    Public Awareness\u000d\u000a      Governments and the food industry need to provide consumers with\u000d\u000a      information about acrylamide and associated mitigation measures. Our\u000d\u000a      pioneering research at Reading has been used in the provision of such\u000d\u000a      information to the public by highly respected and influential\u000d\u000a      organisations, such as the National Cancer Institute in the USA [f] and\u000d\u000a      the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations FAO [g].\u000d\u000a      Acrylamide formation is one of the biggest scientific issues ever to hit\u000d\u000a      the food industry and it continues to attract huge media interest.\u000d\u000a      Articles describing the Reading research have appeared in popular science\u000d\u000a      media outlets, for example:\u000d\u000a    Frying and baking explain potential carcinogen in crisps and bread.\u000d\u000a      Nature News.

They then instigated research at\u000d\u000a      Reading to confirm this hypothesis and established that the Maillard\u000d\u000a      reaction involving asparagine and reducing sugars was the route [1]. Their\u000d\u000a      resulting publication in Nature was the first to establish the\u000d\u000a      origin of acrylamide in cooked foods and it has now received well over\u000d\u000a      1000 citations in the scientific literature.\u000d\u000a    This research provided crucial direction for food scientists worldwide &#8212;\u000d\u000a      academic, government and industry &#8212; as they sought to alleviate the\u000d\u000a      acrylamide problem. Our research showed that acrylamide was formed by\u000d\u000a      chemical reactions between natural food components under normal processing\u000d\u000a      conditions. As such, the paper established that complete elimination of\u000d\u000a      acrylamide from all baked and fried potato and cereal products would be\u000d\u000a      impractical to achieve. However, it did demonstrate that mitigation\u000d\u000a      strategies were possible through reduction of essential acrylamide\u000d\u000a      precursors (i.e. asparagine and sugars) in the raw ingredients and through\u000d\u000a      control of the kinetics of the reaction during processing. The chemical\u000d\u000a      pathways leading to acrylamide in food are part of the Maillard reaction,\u000d\u000a      a complex series of reactions between amino acids and sugars that also\u000d\u000a      produces desirable flavours and colours associated with cooked foods.\u000d\u000a      Heating of foods also provides structural changes, which influence\u000d\u000a      digestibility and texture, and creates low moisture products that are\u000d\u000a      shelf-stable. A major challenge, therefore, has been to prepare potato-\u000d\u000a      and cereal-based foods with lower acrylamide levels while maintaining\u000d\u000a      essential colour, flavour and other desirable attributes.\u000d\u000a    Further research involving Reading addressed these issues by providing\u000d\u000a      more detailed understanding of the chemical pathways involved [2], through\u000d\u000a      investigations of the kinetics of acrylamide formation [3], and examining\u000d\u000a      the relationship with flavour generation. Kinetic models have been\u000d\u000a      generated for cereal and potato products, including French fries, that\u000d\u000a      were used to predict acrylamide formation in relation to sugar and amino\u000d\u000a      acid precursors for different time-temperature regimes [3]. Other work\u000d\u000a      examined potential mitigation strategies, such as modifying pH, and adding\u000d\u000a      components that compete with asparagine in the Maillard reaction. However,\u000d\u000a      strategies that are showing the best long-term potential involve the use\u000d\u000a      of plant genetics and agronomy to reduce acrylamide formation in foods. We\u000d\u000a      have been partners in BBSRC-funded projects with Rothamsted Research that\u000d\u000a      have studied the genetics of asparagine, amino acid and sugar formation in\u000d\u000a      potato, wheat and rye [4, 5] and the role of agronomy in the accumulation\u000d\u000a      of acrylamide precursors during plant growth [6]. One particularly\u000d\u000a      important finding has been that wheat grown under conditions of severe\u000d\u000a      sulphate depletion contained greatly increased concentrations of free\u000d\u000a      asparagine &#8212; up to 30 times more compared with wheat receiving normal\u000d\u000a      levels of sulphate &#8212; which led to increased levels of acrylamide when\u000d\u000a      heated [6].\u000d\u000a    Key researchers: Professor Donald Mottram (from 2002 to date), Dr\u000d\u000a      Stephen Elmore (Senior Research Fellow; 2002 to date), Dr Jane Parker\u000d\u000a      (Senior Research Fellow; 2011 to date).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37316","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In 2008, RVC contributed to the BBC1 documentary, Pedigree Dogs\u000a        Exposed, which attracted 3.9\u000a      million viewers, and was responsible for three separate reports being\u000a      commissioned into breed\u000a      issues [a]. The programme highlighted, principally, a welfare concern, but\u000a      noted additional\u000a      economic impact, in added costs of veterinary care. It reported that\u000a      pedigree animals make up\u000a      75% of the seven million dogs in the UK (estimated in 2012 to be 9.4\u000a      million) and cost their owners\u000a      over &#163;10m in veterinarians' fees each week. The chronic pain affecting\u000a      CKCS afflicted by\u000a      syringomyelia was presented as a particularly graphic illustration of a\u000a      more general issue, and the\u000a      writer and director, acknowledged the substantial contribution from RVC\u000a      researchers to produce\u000a      the programme and subsequently: \"I made particular use of RVC work on\u000a        Chiari-like Malformation\u000a        and Syringomyelia in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels [...] RVC\u000a        researchers and research findings\u000a        were also extremely helpful in preparation of the follow-up documentary,\u000a        in 2012, which reported\u000a        progress but also ongoing concerns over these two [with BOAS] welfare\u000a        issues. Amongst the\u000a        breakthrough developments since the original programme, I would single\u000a        out VetCompass for\u000a        providing the UK-wide epidemiological data necessary to monitor canine\u000a        health and welfare [...]\u000a        research originating from the Royal Veterinary College underpinned much\u000a        of the content of\u000a        Pedigree Dogs Exposed, ensuring the programme's claims could not be\u000a        dismissed lightly.\u000a        Furthermore, the lasting impact of the programme is due in no small part\u000a        to the College's continued\u000a        commitment to this issue.\" [b].\u000a    The first documentary was highly influential: resulting in the withdrawal\u000a      of coverage for Crufts dog\u000a      show by the BBC and termination of support by the Dogs Trust, the Royal\u000a      Society for the\u000a      Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the People's Dispensary for Sick\u000a      Animals.\u000a    RVC's research and expertise was used in each of the resulting inquiry\u000a      reports [c,d,e], The reports\u000a      also noted a lack of quality data on prevalence of breed related health\u000a      problems. The Executive\u000a      Summary in the report of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal\u000a      Welfare noted: \"However,\u000a        there is a lack of information available about the scale of the problem\u000a        [health and welfare of many\u000a        pedigree dogs], which makes it difficult to obtain a clear picture of\u000a        what percentage of dogs are\u000a        affected. As the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) has shown that the\u000a        problem is widespread to\u000a        different degrees of severity in many of the most popular breeds we\u000a        believe further action must be\u000a        taken immediately.\" The Bateson inquiry included a call for\u000a      evidence, and in the report, points from\u000a      respondents included: \"A long list of heritable diseases affected dogs,\u000a        but little or no hard data\u000a        were available on prevalence. A few respondents pointed to the need for\u000a        a system to collect data\u000a        from veterinary surgeries, as being developed by the Royal Veterinary\u000a        College.\"\u000a    Each of the reports [c,d,e] concluded that current breeding practices\u000a      were detrimental to the\u000a      welfare of pedigree dogs. The Kennel Club subsequently completed its\u000a      ongoing revision of its\u000a      breed standards for every breed individually [f]. The revisions specify\u000a      that standards \"will not\u000a        include anything that could in any way be interpreted as encouraging\u000a        features that might prevent a\u000a        dog from breathing, walking and seeing freely\". For individual\u000a      breeds, the revisions frequently\u000a      include addition of `relatively', `moderately', `no exaggeration' and `not\u000a      excessive' and deletion of\u000a      `massive', to descriptions of breed characteristics. Additionally, it\u000a      sought to limit inbreeding by\u000a      \"refusing to register those puppies that are born from any mother\/son,\u000a        father\/daughter or\u000a        brother\/sister mating, taking place on or after 1st\u000a        March 2009\". The Kennel Club's Genetics and\u000a      Health Information Manager acknowledges RVC's role: \"RVC's research\u000a        into both the causes and\u000a        extent of breed-associated ill health and the extent of human perception\u000a        of these conditions, has\u000a        been extremely valuable in raising awareness and increasing\u000a        understanding of health and welfare\u000a        matters. Its work with breeders and breed clubs internationally has\u000a        helped to ensure that the\u000a        research outputs are taken into account and deliver tangible benefit in\u000a        terms of a healthier dog\u000a        population.\" [g]\u000a    An independent Advisory Council for welfare issues of dog breeding was\u000a      established in 2010, with\u000a      the support of the Dogs Trust, to pursue implementation of the other\u000a      recommendations of the three\u000a      reports [h]. Their Veterinary Director notes: \"RVC... contributed to\u000a        the section [of the first annual\u000a        report] relating to breathing difficulties and the majority of the other\u000a        priorities (ocular problems,\u000a        syringomyelia, idiopathic epilepsy and heart disease) are areas in which\u000a        RVC research findings are\u000a        contributing to canine health and welfare.\" [i].\u000a    The perceived `demonisation' of specialist breeders, and their initial\u000a      rejection of the PDE\u000a      documentary's claims, themselves created a barrier to improving welfare.\u000a      Consequently, the RVC\u000a      researchers have pursued a positive relationship with the pedigree clubs,\u000a      guided by outputs from\u000a      research into owners' (limited) perceptions of problems. They have\u000a      developed partnerships with\u000a      associations representing CKCS and other affected breeds, aided by the\u000a      Kennel Club's\u000a      overarching support for liaison between breeders and veterinary\u000a      scientists, in order to involve them\u000a      actively in work designed to improve health and welfare. Outputs from\u000a      VetCompass have\u000a      assisted, as anticipated by the inquiry reports, in providing firm\u000a      evidence for scale and scope of\u000a      specific problems.\u000a    The number of CKCS in the UK alone is estimated to easily exceed 65,000\u000a      (over 11,000 are now\u000a      registered in a single year), making it the 6th most popular\u000a      breed. There are also breed clubs\u000a      across Europe, North America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. All\u000a      are said to be\u000a      descended from six dogs. Studies of relatively small selected groups\u000a      suggest that over 95% bear\u000a      the Chiari-like malformation and, the majority of these may go on to\u000a      develop SM. Other disorders\u000a      in CKCS consequent on in-breeding are, unsurprisingly, common.\u000a    CKCS breeders' symposia, attracting around 60-70 participants were held\u000a      in 2006 and 2010 and\u000a      led to the Cavalier Club sponsoring research at RVC (see [2,3]), relating\u000a      to the mismatch of brain\u000a      and cranium size in CKCS. [text removed for publication]. Interim breeding\u000a      guidelines were\u000a      instituted, based on the research, discussion and report from the\u000a      international Cavalier Club round\u000a      table organised and hosted by RVC in 2006 [j]. Five years on from this,\u000a      independent research\u000a      showed a tangible impact on dog health and welfare: where a scheme was\u000a      implemented to screen\u000a      dogs by MRI. Where it was possible to select at least one parent that was\u000a      SM-free at five years of\u000a      age, the incidence of young dogs with severe clinical symptoms was\u000a      reduced. The analysis\u000a      showed 70% of CKCS offspring were unaffected by SM when both parents SM\u000a      free; 77% were\u000a      affected when one parent affected; and 92% affected when both parents\u000a      affected.

This was sparked by her observation, whilst at the RVC\u000a      (1994-1997 as Senior\u000a      Training Scholar and then Staff Clinician), of a syndrome of persistent\u000a      scratching in CKCS, which,\u000a      through correspondence with general practitioners, was shown to be common\u000a      in the breed. Studies\u000a      at RVC continued to characterise the anatomical basis of the syndrome [2]\u000a      suggesting over-crowding of the caudal cranial fossa (CCF) occurred. More\u000a      recently, Dr Holger Volk (progressing\u000a      from internship and residency from 2004, to Senior Lecturer in Veterinary\u000a      Neurology and\u000a      Neurosurgery), together with Dr Imelda McGonnell (from 2004, Lecturer and\u000a      then Senior Lecturer\u000a      in Reproduction and Development), in collaboration with Rusbridge clearly\u000a      demonstrated that the\u000a      syndrome in CKCS was related to oversize of the cerebellum relative to the\u000a      CCF. Although clinical\u000a      signs do not correlate with degree of cerebellar herniation [3], the\u000a      presence of SM is related to the\u000a      size of the cerebellum leading to over-crowding of the caudal part of the\u000a      CCF [4].\u000a    Most recently, the research team has linked this to continuance of\u000a      juvenile appearance and traits\u000a      into adulthood, particularly of gait, which is known to be controlled by\u000a      the cerebellum (to be\u000a      published shortly). As the puppyish characteristics are viewed as major\u000a      part of their appeal, this\u000a      presents a real challenge to modifying the breed. The Animal Welfare team\u000a      has undertaken\u000a      sociological studies which are addressing similar issues of breed appeal\u000a      and (un)awareness of\u000a      health and welfare issues: for example, documenting the lack of perception\u000a      of breathing problems\u000a      (including Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS)) in\u000a      brachycephalic breeds [5].\u000a      This appreciation has helped the team in their interactions with owners\u000a      and breeders, to encourage\u000a      implementation of impact, and led to further research support from the\u000a      Cavalier breed Club.\u000a    To assist the KC's commitment to qualitative changes in breed\u000a      descriptors, to address breed-related\u000a      problems, Dr Charlotte Burn, (Research Fellow from 2008 and Lecturer in\u000a      Animal Welfare\u000a      Science since 2010) set out to quantify conformation-related problems\u000a      (slipped discs in long bodies\u000a      [6]; and eye ulcers and breathing disorders in brachycephalics (submitted\u000a      for publication 2013)),\u000a      with the aim of adding quantitative limits to KC breed standards.\u000a    The CKCS and other breed health issues have connected to several other\u000a      programmes of\u000a      research at RVC, for instance into mitral valve disease &#8212; where the\u000a      prevalence in CKCS is about\u000a      twenty times that of other breeds (see case study `Improving diagnosis and\u000a      treatment of canine\u000a      heart disease'). The need for quality data on prevalence and risk to\u000a      identify the true scale of health\u000a      issues, was a further concern highlighted in the inquiry reports triggered\u000a      by the Pedigree Dogs\u000a        Exposed documentary.\u000a    The RVC's VetCompass project, led by David Church (Professor of Small\u000a      Animal Studies since\u000a      2001) and Dr David Brodbelt (Lecturer from 2004, then Senior Lecturer in\u000a      Companion Animal\u000a      Epidemiology from 2007), is now addressing this need. The database has\u000a      grown to over 500,000\u000a      cases and has brought 180 private and charitable practices in the UK into\u000a      participation in the\u000a      research activity. One example of its use was a study using the (then) 89\u000a      primary veterinary clinics\u000a      supplying data, to analyse prevalence, risk factors and survival from\u000a      records of chronic kidney\u000a      disease &#8212; again quantifying the higher risk in certain breeds &#8212; in 107,214\u000a      dogs [7].\u000a    Other Quality and Relevance Indicators\u000a      McGonnell.

It is estimated that some two million Atlantic salmon\u000a      escape each year in the\u000a      North Atlantic, which is equivalent to about 50% of the total number of\u000a      wild adult salmon in the\u000a      area. Escaped salmon enter rivers where they breed and interbreed with\u000a      wild salmon, thereby\u000a      changing the genetic make-up of wild populations. Farm-reared brown trout\u000a      are stocked in most\u000a      European countries where native populations are also present. In Britain\u000a      and Ireland over two\u000a      million such trout are stocked each year. Many local angling groups also\u000a      maintain hatcheries for\u000a      stocking both species.\u000a    The key findings of our salmon studies were that offspring of farmed,\u000a      first and second generation\u000a      hybrids, and backcrosses both to wild and farmed salmon showed reduced\u000a      survival compared with\u000a      wild salmon, and that repeated escape events can cause a reduction in\u000a      survival and reproductive\u000a      success of vulnerable wild populations potentially leading to their\u000a      extinction. Brown trout\u000a      investigations showed four detrimental impacts of stocking farm-reared\u000a      brown trout into wild\u000a      populations: (1) Loss of genetic diversity among wild populations, such\u000a      diversity being essential for\u000a      long-term survival and continued adaptation to changing conditions; (2)\u000a      Reduction in fitness due to\u000a      loss of local adaptations as a result of interbreeding with farm-reared\u000a      trout; (3) Reduction in fitness\u000a      as a result of interbreeding with farm-reared trout, which are maladapted\u000a      for life in the wild due to\u000a      domestication; (4) Loss of key life history types, and consequent\u000a      reduction in diversity of angling\u000a      opportunity and experience.\u000a    Due to the fact that almost all the brown trout population genetic\u000a      research in the UK and Ireland\u000a      had been carried out at QUB, together with key inter-related work on\u000a      Atlantic salmon, Ferguson\u000a      was asked by the Environment Agency (England &amp; Wales) to produce a\u000a      report on genetic impacts\u000a      of stocking on indigenous brown trout populations. Ferguson's (2007)\u000a      report is one of the main\u000a      sources listed under Research References by the Environment Agency (EA) in\u000a      their 2008 Review\u000a      of Brown Trout Policy. It was described by the EA as part of their \"work\u000a      with leading authorities on\u000a      trout fisheries management, analysis of scientific research, and an\u000a      extensive consultation\u000a      process\". Ferguson's report examined evidence on the impact on wild trout\u000a      stocks of stocking\u000a      domesticated fertile brown trout and on the potential alternative use of\u000a      sterile fish. This policy\u000a      review was pivotal for the change of brown trout stocking policy in\u000a      England in Wales. The\u000a      Environment Agency made the decision in 2008 to stop giving consent to\u000a      stock rivers and lakes\u000a      with fertile (diploid) farm strain brown trout in England and Wales from\u000a      2015, only stocking with\u000a      infertile (female triploid) brown trout or the progeny of local broodstock\u000a      reared under a suitable\u000a      regime being permitted.\u000a    As a direct result of work carried out at QUB and in response to the\u000a      Species and Habitats Review\u000a      Report, published in 2007, brown trout has been added to the list of\u000a      priority fish species in the UK\u000a      Biodiversity Action Plan, which is the UK Government's response to the\u000a      Convention on Biological\u000a      Diversity, signed in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. Following advice to the\u000a      Northern Ireland Department of\u000a      the Environment's Environment and Heritage Service (EHS), later NI\u000a      Environment Agency (NIEA),\u000a      on the existence of unique brown trout populations, Lough Melvin was\u000a      declared an Area of Special\u000a      Scientific Interest (ASSI) in 1997. Under ASSI status, no stocking with\u000a      farm strain trout is allowed.\u000a      Indeed any change in management requires NIEA permission. The Wild Trout\u000a      Trust, a major\u000a      charity dedicated to the conservation of brown trout in Britain and\u000a      Ireland, produced a statement in\u000a      2012 providing background and advice to fishery managers on brown trout\u000a      genetics and stocking.\u000a      This 15-page document includes five citations of QUB work and, as a\u000a      scientific adviser to the Trust,\u000a      Ferguson made a substantial contribution to drafting it.\u000a    Following concerns about the impact of salmon farm escapes, the WWF set\u000a      up a dialogue\u000a      involving key scientists and farm industry representatives. Ferguson was\u000a      invited to be a member of\u000a      the working party. The final global standards for the industry (published\u000a      February 2012) in respect\u000a      of genetic impacts are based substantially on QUB publications. The North\u000a      Atlantic Salmon\u000a      Conservation Organisation (NASCO), an international body established by\u000a      inter-governmental\u000a      convention, sought QUB advice on genetic impact of escaped farm salmon and\u000a      on supportive\u000a      breeding (use of offspring of native broodstock) on various occasions over\u000a      the past 20 years.\u000a      Current (2009-2011) NASCO international guidance draws significantly on\u000a      this advice and our\u000a      publications.\u000a    European government agencies (e.g. Scotland, Norway) have implemented\u000a      advice on trout\u000a      stocking and farm escapes. New legislation came into force on August 1,\u000a      2008, regulating the\u000a      introduction the stocking of all species of freshwater fish within\u000a      Scotland, including trout and\u000a      salmon. Internationally, results of QUB studies on salmon escapes have\u000a      been central to the\u000a      development of a national policy for the farming of European origin salmon\u000a      in Canadian waters\u000a      commissioned by the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (Verspoor et\u000a        al., in press:\u000a      corroborated by Professor, University of the Highlands and Islands) on\u000a      behalf of the Canadian\u000a      Government.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The effects of accidental salmon farm escapes, intentional releases of\u000a      non-native salmon and\u000a      trout, and stocking of fertile farm-reared trout, on the genetic makeup,\u000a      fitness and long-term\u000a      viability of wild populations has been a matter of increasing concern over\u000a      the past two decades.\u000a      Ferguson and Prod&#246;hl's group demonstrated that offspring of farmed, first\u000a      and second generation\u000a      hybrid and backcrossed salmon and trout showed reduced survival compared\u000a      with wild native fish,\u000a      and that repeated escape\/introduction events can cause a reduction in the\u000a      biological fitness of\u000a      vulnerable wild populations leading to reductions in numbers and\u000a      potentially to their extinction.\u000a      These findings led directly to changes in regulations and guidelines by\u000a      relevant major stakeholders\u000a      including the Environment Agency (England &amp; Wales), Wild Trout Trust,\u000a      North Atlantic Salmon\u000a      Conservation Organisation, World Wildlife Fund, and governments in Europe\u000a      and North America.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000a    Queen's University Belfast\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen's University Belfast","InstitutionName":"Queen's University Belfast","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10005343}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3451190","Name":"Rio de Janeiro"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1. *McGinnity, P., Stone, C., Taggart, J.

The salmon farming industry\u000a      world-wide is worth &#163;4.2\u000a      billion. Due to anthropogenic factors (e.g. habitat degradation,\u000a      introduced diseases and parasites,\u000a      overfishing) wild stocks of both species have declined throughout Britain\u000a      and Ireland and\u000a      elsewhere within their ranges. Both socio-economic and environmental\u000a      considerations are,\u000a      therefore, very important when considering management of these species in\u000a      respect to fisheries\u000a      and biodiversity. Atlantic salmon and brown trout farming, and stocking\u000a      with farm-reared and non-\u000a      native salmon and trout, have been the most prevalent methods of\u000a      attempting both to meet the\u000a      consumer demand for these fish and to mitigate real or perceived wild\u000a      population declines.\u000a      However, the impacts of salmon farm escapes, intentional releases of\u000a      non-native salmon and trout\u000a      and stocking of fertile farm-reared trout on the genetic integrity,\u000a      fitness and long-term viability of\u000a      wild populations have been a matter of considerable debate over many\u000a      years, with little empirical\u000a      evidence prior to the QUB studies.\u000a    Research at QUB: For the last 40 years researchers at QUB, under\u000a      the leadership of Professors\u000a      Andrew Ferguson (retired 30\/11\/04, Professor Emeritus until 30\/06\/14) and\u000a      Paulo Prod&#246;hl, have\u000a      researched molecular population genetics with a particular focus on the\u000a      conservation and\u000a      management of salmonid fishes, especially brown trout and Atlantic salmon.\u000a      Farm-reared Atlantic\u000a      salmon and brown trout differ from their wild counterparts genetically\u000a      (primarily due to\u000a      domestication in culture), phenotypically, and behaviourally. Individual\u000a      wild populations differ\u000a      substantially in their genetic make-up as a result of colonisation history\u000a      and local adaptation. The\u000a      genetic impact on native populations of deliberate and\/or inadvertent\u000a      introductions of farmed stock\u000a      and non-native salmonids has been an area of particular research interest\u000a      by the group. From\u000a      1993 to 2002 Ferguson and Prod&#246;hl, in collaboration with McGinnity (joint\u000a      QUB\/Salmon Research\u000a      Agency of Ireland, now the Marine Institute of Ireland) and colleagues\u000a      from University College\u000a      Cork, Scottish Office Marine and Freshwater Laboratories, Norwegian\u000a      Institute for Nature\u000a      Research, Xunta Galicia, and University of Oviedo, Spain, carried out\u000a      novel investigations in this\u000a      area. This work was supported by two major EC grants (totalling &#163;3M; QUB\u000a      was coordinator of\u000a      one), as well as grants from NERC and the Marine Institute Ireland\u000a      specifically to QUB. Innovative\u000a      common garden experiments were made feasible by the previous development\u000a      of single locus\u000a      DNA fingerprinting for salmonids (also EC funded); QUB were the first\u000a      group worldwide to develop\u000a      and publish the application of genetic markers for the elucidation of\u000a      previously intractable\u000a      ecological questions associated with salmonid biology. DNA fingerprinting\u000a      enabled for the first time\u000a      common garden experiments to be undertaken under natural conditions from\u000a      the egg stage\u000a      onwards and continued in subsequent generations. This, along with the\u000a      unique freshwater and\u000a      marine field facilities of the Marine Institute, enabled large scale\u000a      experiments to be undertaken in\u000a      the wild that were subsequently of widespread interest to salmonid\u000a      biologists and managers in both\u000a      Europe and North America. During the same period and subsequently,\u000a      research on salmon and\u000a      trout involved studies of the distribution and changes in genetic\u000a      diversity, and local adaptation, in\u000a      natural populations of both species. The unique trout populations of Lough\u000a      Melvin were one focus\u000a      of such investigations. In 2007, Prod&#246;hl received a 7-year grant (value &#8364;1\u000a      million - Beaufort Marine\u000a      Award) in Fish Population Genetics to continue research on the impacts of\u000a      deliberate and\/or\u000a      inadvertent introductions on native salmonid populations. As part of this\u000a      project, additional common\u000a      garden studies of native, non-native and farm-origin brown trout are being\u000a      undertaken.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38451","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The implementation of batteries of innovative tests, developed by Elliott\u000a      and his colleagues, in the control programmes of regulatory laboratories\u000a      around the world has had a major impact through the protection of\u000a      consumers globally and enhancement of trading opportunities. Without such\u000a      tests many contamination incidents would go unchecked and the ability of\u000a      many countries to monitor imported foods and support their own exports\u000a      would be greatly inhibited.\u000a    The globalisation of the trade in animal feeds and food has brought about\u000a      many benefits, e.g. cost reduction and year round availability of\u000a      foodstuffs. However, one of the biggest problems it has caused is a\u000a      massive increase in the importation of multiple products into Europe from\u000a      countries with low standards of feed\/food safety. Since the BSE crisis of\u000a      the 1980's European consumers have become more and more concerned with the\u000a      safety of the food they eat. This has led to a marked reduction in their\u000a      trust in governments' ability to protect them from food-related hazards.\u000a      Among the most feared risks are those relating to dangerous chemicals in\u000a      food. There are several thousand licensed veterinary pharmaceuticals and\u000a      pesticides and many hundreds of illegally used compounds. Added to this\u000a      are the problems with dioxin\/PCB contaminations, heavy metals, mycotoxins\u000a      and fraud issues involving nitrogen substitutes (such as melamine). An\u000a      additional complexity is that these chemicals must be measured at very low\u000a      concentrations to meet legislative requirements (usually parts per\u000a      billion). The time to undertake the analysis and costs involved add a\u000a      further dimension of difficulty to contaminant analysis\/detection. During\u000a      a period spanning nearly 20 years Elliott's work at QUB in delivering\u000a      methods that met, and continue to meet, ever-increasing demands has become\u000a      recognised globally. The majority of laboratories around the world, both\u000a      private sector and governmental, employ at least a number of these tests\u000a      in their routine testing programmes. The global sales of diagnostic test\u000a      kits plus verification from a number of leading governmental monitoring\u000a      laboratories helps reinforce this claim. Elliott and colleagues have\u000a      organised many training workshops for scientists working in regulatory\u000a      environments from all over the world to learn the QUB procedures. These\u000a      have been performed in conjunction with the EU Community Reference\u000a      Laboratories for Drug Residue Control, the EU Directorate Generals SANCO\u000a      (Food Safety) and DG TRADE. In addition, in collaboration with the UN FAO,\u000a      training workshops organised across the developing world have achieved\u000a      global reach. In 2001 QUB (Elliott) was a founding member of the\u000a      international School for Advanced Residue Analysis in Foods\u000a      (http:\/\/www.saraf-educ.org\/). This international School, held twice\u000a      annually, has trained over 600 scientists from 90 countries in methods\u000a      developed at QUB. In 2010 this initiative was extended from funding from\u000a      the Marie Curie programme to develop training opportunities specifically\u000a      for European postgraduate students.\u000a    The development of easy to use and reliable ELISA and biosensor-based\u000a      test kits for the detection of drug residues in foods has been another\u000a      excellent means of transferring the research to food control laboratories\u000a      globally. Kit sales now extend to well over 50 countries around the world\u000a      (2013 data). Indeed new product lines are being developed in collaboration\u000a      with QUB via funding for postgraduate students, many of whom get jobs\u000a      working in the associated diagnostics companies (some via KTP projects)\u000a      upon completion of their degrees. Tests to detect illegal dyes,\u000a      antibiotics and toxins in foods were launched in 2012 by Neogen.\u000a    Good testing methods alone are not sufficient to prevent feed and food\u000a      contamination. The costs associated with developing and implementing\u000a      robust monitoring programmes are substantial. It is impossible to test\u000a      every batch of animal feed and foodstuff produced for every possible\u000a      contaminant that might be present. Elliott and his team undertook one of\u000a      the largest studies of its kind in the world. They analysed every reported\u000a      chemical-based food contamination incident recorded globally over a 5-year\u000a      period. From this they were able to determine frequency of events relating\u000a      to the types of feed and food commodities, the geographic origin of the\u000a      contaminated materials and the possible health risks and industry risks\u000a      associated with each contamination event. Using a set of algorithms and\u000a      intimate knowledge of chemical analytical techniques, Elliott produced a\u000a      scheme for industry to set up a self-monitoring programme. This unique\u000a      scheme was implemented in 2013 in Northern Ireland by the Grain Trade\u000a      Association as a pilot and will be rolled out to the rest of Ireland and\u000a      the UK in 2014.

Elliott and his colleagues\u000a      set out to produce two types of testing procedures that would support the\u000a      implementation of these directives and protect the consumer.\u000a    Problems addressed included the isolation of many and differing compounds\u000a      from highly complex matrices, unequivocal identification to forensic\u000a      standards and quantification at parts per billion concentrations with\u000a      acceptable measurement uncertainty. Some compounds, owing to their\u000a      toxicity and significance to the consumer, were designated as\u000a      `zero-tolerance' in law, presenting industry and regulators with the huge\u000a      problem of interpreting that concept in the real world of measurement\u000a      science.\u000a    The QUB team has become renowned globally for their work in developing\u000a      rapid, broad-spectrum antibody-based screening tests for chemicals in feed\u000a      and foods. They developed innovative chemistries that permitted the\u000a      generation of antibodies that could detect entire families of chemicals\u000a      with unprecedented levels of sensitivity. These antibodies were then\u000a      incorporated into a range of immunochemical platform technologies that\u000a      provided a multitude of end users with rapid and reliable results. QUB\u000a      pioneered the use of surface plasmon resonance biosensing for contaminants\u000a      (2,4,5). This was achieved by developing a series of novel surface\u000a      chemistries on gold sensor surfaces that permitted antibody-chemical\u000a      interactions to be measured in minutes as opposed to up to a day for\u000a      conventional tests. Another notable innovation was the very simple, low\u000a      cost and rapid sample preparation techniques developed. The innovations\u000a      also included the use of purified cell receptors to detect families of\u000a      chemical contaminants. The ability to extract and stabilise the\u000a      beta-agonist receptor from cultured cells allowed the only receptor-based\u000a      test in the world to detect man-made chemicals to be introduced into\u000a      European monitoring programmes (3). European legislation also demanded\u000a      that advanced mass spectrometric techniques had to be used to produce\u000a      `unequivocal evidence' of the presence of chemical contaminants in feeds\u000a      and foods. Elliott and his group not only developed such methods but took\u000a      these further than many other research groups around the world by\u000a      producing methods that could confirm the presence of multiple contaminants\u000a      using highly innovative forms of sample preparation and chromatography\u000a      (6). The extreme robustness built into these methods, coupled to their\u000a      ultra-high sensitivity and rigorous validations, enabled them to be used\u000a      in regulatory laboratories around the world. There are over 100\u000a      peer-reviewed publications related to this case study. The opportunities\u000a      opened up by the research included safer global trade, but most\u000a      significantly a novel system of business collaboration for supply chain\u000a      integrity underpinned by the research institute as the `honest broker'.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38452","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Fisheries in Bangladesh is second only to the garment sector in total\u000a      national export earnings.\u000a      Shrimp alone accounts for about 80 - 85% of the total export earnings from\u000a      all fisheries\u000a      commodities. About 25% of the total shrimp export earnings comes from the\u000a      Giant Freshwater\u000a      Shrimp, Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Bangladesh is one of the top producers\u000a      of this shrimp\u000a      globally. This and other shrimp species exported from Bangladesh are\u000a      mostly the products of\u000a      aquaculture. Besides its role in export, the shrimp aquaculture based\u000a      industry is one of the major\u000a      sources of rural employments for men and women, supports several\u000a      categories of rural based\u000a      ancillary industries &#8212; all significantly contributing to the country's\u000a      overall economic development.\u000a      Clearly, the success of the shrimp based industry is extremely important\u000a      for sustained economic\u000a      development of this country. The yearly total value only from frozen\u000a      shrimp and fish exports\u000a      fluctuated between US$322 million and US$ 611 million during the last 10\u000a      years. Due to the\u000a      detection of contamination by nitrofurans in large quantities of shrimp by\u000a      Belgian authorities in\u000a      2008, exports fell by approximately 17%, by comparison with the average\u000a      over the previous 5\u000a      years. By 2009 a further 16% deduction in exports resulted.\u000a    The nitrofuran incident impacted hugely on the shrimp industry and entire\u000a      Bangladesh society in\u000a      many different ways: (i) An immediate export revenue loss valued at many\u000a      millions of pounds, (ii)\u000a      loss of Bangladesh image in the international market for Bangladesh\u000a      fisheries products, (iii) closure\u000a      of thousands of shrimp farms and tens of hatcheries across the country,\u000a      (iv) loss of thousands in\u000a      employment in the sector, (v) a huge economic loss which was felt right\u000a      across the country, both\u000a      immediate and fears of even worse long-term damage.\u000a    The European Commission, based on Kennedy's research realised the error\u000a      that had been made\u000a      and on the 15th November 2011 issued a formal repel of the emergency\u000a      measures that had been\u000a      put in place with regards Bangaldeshi aquaculture products. Now, just five\u000a      years since the 2008\u000a      crisis unfolded, due to the research conducted at QUB there is a much\u000a      stronger case for\u000a      Bangladesh to be considered as a producer of safe food. Indeed, the\u000a      Bangladeshi industry now\u000a      views the future with high levels of optimism. Despite the setbacks of\u000a      recent years, there is an\u000a      industry-governmental plan to increase production from 60,000 tonnes of\u000a      prawn annually from\u000a      80,000 hectares of farms. This is double the current output of the\u000a      country. Kennedy's nitrofuran\u000a      research has had a massive and positive impact of the livelihoods of\u000a      thousands of the world's\u000a      poorest people.\u000a    Kennedy's research uncovered the complex cause of the nitrofuran\u000a      contamination problems. He\u000a      worked with the Bangladeshi industry and government not only to uncover\u000a      the true causes of the\u000a      problem but on a much wider scale to greatly improve the safety and\u000a      quality of their entire\u000a      aquaculture industry. Kennedy was able to convince the Belgium government\u000a      that their\u000a      laboratories had made a serious error in alerting the entire European\u000a      Union (and rest of the world)\u000a      about a contamination that never actually occurred. This had a massive\u000a      follow on impact of the\u000a      stance of the European Commission with regards Bangladeshi shrimp imports\u000a      into Europe.\u000a      As a consequence of the shrimp crisis in 2010 and further European\u000a      Commission penalties, the\u000a      Bangladeshi government banned the use of all antibiotics in all animal\u000a      feeds as part of their\u000a      response to the on-going emergency. However, this ban had an\u000a      unintentional, yet devastating,\u000a      effect of causing marked increased mortalities in the Bangladeshi poultry\u000a      industry caused\u000a      particularly by necrotic enteritis and causing yet more economic losses to\u000a      the agri-food sector and\u000a      extreme hardship to subsistence farmers and their families. The\u000a      profitability of this industry is vital\u000a      to the nation, as poultry is the principal animal protein source for the\u000a      Bangladeshi population. At\u000a      two meetings in Dhaka, (January 2013) chaired by the Minister of\u000a      Agriculture and the Chief\u000a      Veterinary Officer, respectively, Kennedy advised relaxing the ban &#8212;\u000a      permitting the use of the four\u000a      \"beneficial antibiotics\" in poultry feed. This advice has been accepted\u000a      and is being implemented via\u000a      the Bangladeshi parliament, thus averting another food crisis in the\u000a      region.\u000a    The EU's investigations of the shrimp problems did uncover vast gaps in\u000a      the ability of this country\u000a      to provide local consumers and export customers with safe food. Through\u000a      Kennedy's research and\u000a      high level advise to industry, governmental agencies and government\u000a      laboratories a much better\u000a      system in now in place to safeguard citizens all over the world who\u000a      purchase and consume\u000a      Bangladeshi produce.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Kennedy and his team helped resolve a massive societal and economic\u000a      problem for Bangladesh\u000a      and ensured safer food for consumers worldwide.

Queen's researchers were able to\u000a      demonstrate the effectiveness\u000a      of the new test and the widespread use of furazolidone in pig production\u000a      in the UK (17% of kidneys\u000a      tested AOZ positive), shortly before the introduction of the ban.\u000a    The Queen's-led FP5 FoodBRAND team developed new analytical methods,\u000a      based on LC-MS\/MS\u000a      to detect tissue bound metabolites for all nitrofurans3. These tests were\u000a      employed to analyse\u000a      imported shrimp from Asia and large numbers of bound residues were\u000a      detected. Similar problems\u000a      were found in chicken imported from Thailand and Brazil, which accounted\u000a      for ~25% of the chicken\u000a      consumed in the UK. This rapidly developed into the \"global nitrofuran\u000a      crisis\" where multiple foods\u000a      from many countries were embroiled in scares about dangerous chemical\u000a      residues being found4.\u000a      The Queen's method is now used globally to control nitrofuran misuse.\u000a    The finding of nitrofuran residues in imported foods resulted in the EU\u000a      imposing severe import\u000a      restrictions on China, Thailand, Brazil, India and Bangladesh. It appeared\u000a      misuse across the world\u000a      was under control and further research identified other markers of\u000a      nitrofuran abuse5. However, in\u000a      Bangladesh, the worst effects of the contamination of aquaculture produce,\u000a      especially shrimp\u000a      arose in 2008. Bangladeshi exporters of giant river prawn were rocked by\u000a      more than 50 rejections\u000a      of consignments of their product in Europe. This caused the EU to place a\u000a      ban on their products.\u000a      Based on Kennedy's research into the highly complex origins of nitrofuran\u000a      contamination he and\u000a      his team were able to determine that a Belgian laboratory had made a major\u000a      mistake in their\u000a      analytical protocol. Kennedy's work uncovered that a nitrofuran metabolite\u000a      (semicarbazide) was\u000a      naturally occurring and was present in the shell of shrimps, without\u000a      exposure to any nitrofuran6. In\u000a      Belgium they included the shell in their testing regime. Beginning in\u000a      March 2008, Kennedy set out\u000a      to convince the Belgian authorities to correct the analytical error and to\u000a      prove that the residues of\u000a      semicarbazide had occurred naturally in the shell of the river prawn and\u000a      other crustaceans. This\u000a      was achieved by carrying out extensive sampling and analysis of shrimp\u000a      samples from many\u000a      regions of Bangladesh. The isolation of semicarbazide from shells of\u000a      shrimps not exposed to any\u000a      nitrofurans was used as compelling scientific evidence that Europe had\u000a      mistakenly branded\u000a      Bangladesh products as contaminated.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38453","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    PCV2 has been associated with a number of disease syndromes or\u000a      pathological conditions in pigs during the last 15 years, and the\u000a      terminology `porcine circovirus diseases' (PCVD) was proposed to replace\u000a      existing acronyms. PMWS is considered the most significant PCVD, and\u000a      therefore most of the prevention\/control and research efforts have been\u000a      focused on it. It is estimated that since its introduction in the 1990s,\u000a      that PCV2 had cost the European industry about &#163;468 million per year [a]\u000a      and, at its height in 2005\/6, it was estimated that PMWS cost EU pig\u000a      producers in excess of &#8364;600-900 million per year. Subsequently, now that\u000a      the disease has been reported in all major pig producing countries around\u000a      the world, global production losses related to untreated PCVD are\u000a      estimated in &#163;billions per year. The impact of PMWS on food safety and\u000a      veterinary public health is also important as PMWS-associated\u000a      immunosuppression results in increased carcase contamination by food-borne\u000a      pathogens and increased virus shedding at slaughter, and an associated\u000a      increase in the use of antimicrobial agents in the attempted control of\u000a      PMWS-associated disease. The latter provides an increased potential for\u000a      selecting for antimicrobial resistant bacteria and drug residues in pig\u000a      meat. PMWS and PCVDs are also important drivers of poor welfare in pigs.\u000a    The initial isolation and characterisation of PCV2 by Allan and\u000a      colleagues at QUB, USASK and Merial, the filing of patents and the\u000a      subsequent body of research that lead to an understanding of the disease\u000a      process and development of diagnostics and vaccines, has been successfully\u000a      deployed around the world to control this devastating disease [b].\u000a      Vaccines to PCV2 are now sold under licence by four multinational\u000a      companies in all pig producing countries, with outstanding and\u000a      unparalleled results. By October 2013, the associated royalty payments to\u000a      QUB were is excess of US$32 million [c].\u000a    PCV2 vaccination has been one of the most extraordinary success stories\u000a      of pig health control and is protecting the health, growth performance and\u000a      welfare of many millions of pigs around the world. No less importantly,\u000a      the results at farm level show that it is more than fulfilling its promise\u000a      to be extremely cost-effective and consumers are benefiting from a\u000a      reduction in antibiotic use. The successful application of this vaccine\u000a      against the diseases of major economic importance associated with PCV2 is\u000a      internationally recognised. Launched in 2006, the PCV2 vaccine sales\u000a      continue to increase year on year around the world with the estimates of\u000a      market share in 2010 in Europe of 51%, North America at 73% and Asia at\u000a      67%. In 2008, world sales of PCV2 vaccines were valued at $265 million [d].\u000a      In 2012 IFAH-Europe (on behalf of the European animal health industry)\u000a      reported that PCV2-vaccination is the only effective control for the PMWS\u000a      [e]. As early as 2009, the major role played by PCV2 vaccination on\u000a      reducing the on-farm use of antimicrobials had been recorded in Canada,\u000a      Japan, South Korea, Thailand and UK [f]. The dramatic positive\u000a      impact on pig farms, with mortality rates falling between 50 and 90% [g],\u000a      has driven a year on year increase of PCV2 vaccine sales, making it the\u000a      market leader [h]. The circovirus vaccines have delivered broad\u000a      global impact and exceptional returns on investment [i]. In 2013,\u000a      Boehringer-Ingelheim reported that one billion pigs had been vaccinated\u000a      against PCV2 with Ingelvac CircoFLEX&#174; and, based on yearly sales\u000a      volumes, that it is the most successful animal vaccine of all time [j].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) had a huge global\u000a      impact on the swine industry with estimated losses of &#8364;5-6 billion\/year\u000a      globally. Allan's team discovered and characterised the agent responsible\u000a      for clinical development of PMWS (porcine circovirus 2 [PCV2]) and used\u000a      these discoveries to drive vaccine development.

Further IPR\u000a      was filed in 1998 (16 patents filed so far) worldwide relevant to the IPR.\u000a      Using the PCV2 isolate from Canadian pigs as the candidate virus\u000a      QUB\/USASK\/Merial developed and tested a PCV2 vaccine which was eventually\u000a      marketed in 2006\/7. Following the launch of this initial vaccine, three\u000a      other multinational companies developed PCV2 vaccines and these are\u000a      marketed under licence to Merial.\u000a    In addition to the global amelioration of PMWS in swine, additional spin\u000a      outs from the research by Allan's team include diagnostic test kits for\u000a      PCV2, e.g. Serelisa CIRCO ELISA kit is on sale worldwide (1.5% royalties\u000a      to QUB). Allan continues to work in QUB on PCV2 research and successfully\u000a      co-ordinated three major EC consortia working on PCV2 and PMWS and\u000a      involving over 22 partner institutes across the EU and North America.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40221","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 2010, a Defra survey of approved processing plants in the UK showed\u000d\u000a      that 78% of plants were using electrical water bath stunners insufficient\u000d\u000a      to induce unconsciousness in chickens [a]. These stunning protocols were\u000d\u000a      also widely used in commercial poultry plants in Europe. This was exposing\u000d\u000a      millions of birds to a potentially painful death. Considering the very\u000d\u000a      large number of animals (minimum 9,350,000 birds per week), this was a\u000d\u000a      major animal welfare concern. However, since 1st January 2013,\u000d\u000a      a new European regulation [b] requires that all abattoirs in Europe must\u000d\u000a      now stun chickens using protocols shown to be effective by Bristol\u000d\u000a      research. The new regulation ensures that billions of birds in Europe are\u000d\u000a      adequately stunned prior to slaughter; a major positive impact on poultry\u000d\u000a      welfare.\u000d\u000a    The Bristol research into the optimum use of water bath electrical\u000d\u000a      stunner parameters has been widely disseminated to the industry by two\u000d\u000a      main routes; i) inclusion within European legislation and, ii) training\u000a        Animal Welfare Officers in abattoirs by University of Bristol staff.\u000d\u000a    i) Impact on Legislation: The Bristol findings on electric water\u000d\u000a      bath stunning parameters were of sufficient welfare significance to be\u000d\u000a      directly incorporated into European legislation [b].\u000d\u000a      Implementation of these findings into legislation was rapid. On 4th April\u000d\u000a      2007, The Humane Slaughter Association (HSA) held a workshop to discuss\u000d\u000a      electrical water bath stunning parameters where the results from Raj and\u000d\u000a      colleagues [1, 2, and 3] were presented. The workshop brought together\u000d\u000a      representatives from the poultry industry, retailers and scientists from\u000d\u000a      across Europe. The potential welfare significance of the findings were\u000d\u000a      highlighted and a recommendation for the research work to be urgently\u000d\u000a      corroborated was subsequently undertaken by Prinz et al in Germany [c, d\u000d\u000a      and e].\u000d\u000a    In the light of the new Bristol research, the European Commission\u000d\u000a      received information and requests from the UK authorities to amend the\u000d\u000a      electrical requirements specified in the previous opinions [f]. The UK\u000d\u000a      authority requested that the high-range frequency band should cover 600 to\u000d\u000a      800 Hz and that it should not extend to 1500 Hz, due to the concerns that\u000d\u000a      frequencies above 800 Hz lead to electro-immobilisation and do not produce\u000d\u000a      an effective stun. The new frequencies were incorporated into the EFSA\u000d\u000a      Scientific Opinion on the electrical requirements for water-bath stunning\u000d\u000a      equipment applicable to poultry [g]. EFSA stated that when insufficient\u000d\u000a      current passes through a bird only certain areas of the brain are\u000d\u000a      affected. Consequently it is possible to induce partial epilepsy that\u000d\u000a      leaves a bird conscious and sensible even though it shows seizures and\u000d\u000a      convulsions that are indistinguishable from those shown after an effective\u000d\u000a      stun [1]. Therefore, the occurrence of seizures and convulsions is not a\u000d\u000a      reliable indicator of unconsciousness and insensibility. Fifteen out of 21\u000d\u000a      studies used to present data for the EFSA document [g] were conducted by\u000d\u000a      members of the University of Bristol, and 14 out of 30 references that\u000d\u000a      were used for the relevant report section had authors from the University.\u000d\u000a      In 2009, the research findings were adopted in the new EC Council\u000d\u000a      regulation No 1099\/2009 of 24 September 2009 (1\/1\/2013) on the protection\u000d\u000a      of animals at the time of killing.\u000d\u000a    ii) Impact on training and function of industry personnel: In\u000d\u000a      recognition of the need for complex technical requirements such as\u000d\u000a      stunning parameters to be well understood by those actually operating\u000d\u000a      slaughter equipment, the European Commission has also enshrined the role\u000d\u000a      of the Animal Welfare Officer (AWO) into the EC regulation. The\u000d\u000a      crucial knowledge transfer role of the AWO has been described in the\u000d\u000a      Council Regulation [b] as follows: \"The appointment of a specifically\u000d\u000a        qualified person as an animal welfare officer to coordinate and follow\u000d\u000a        up the implementation of animal welfare operating procedures in\u000d\u000a        slaughterhouses has provided positive welfare benefits. This measure\u000d\u000a        should therefore be applied throughout the Community. The animal welfare\u000d\u000a        officer should have sufficient authority and technical competence\u000d\u000a        (provided by the course) to provide relevant guidance to line\u000d\u000a        personnel.\" This technical competence includes a need to understand\u000d\u000a      the welfare significance of the stunning protocols previously developed by\u000d\u000a      the Bristol research team [1, 2, 3]. AWO training courses, initiated and\u000d\u000a      run by the University of Bristol, are now available in Europe, and have\u000d\u000a      ensured that these important research findings have been disseminated to\u000d\u000a      those directly responsible for controlling stunning parameters. Bristol\u000d\u000a      played a pivotal role in embedding this robust knowledge transfer\u000d\u000a      mechanism within the poultry industry in Europe, thus providing a\u000d\u000a      long-term sustainable route for translation of future welfare science into\u000d\u000a      practice.\u000d\u000a    Direct involvement of Bristol in delivering impact\u000d\u000a    Active involvement of Bristol researchers in policy and dissemination\u000d\u000a      activities has made an important contribution to the impact in this area.\u000d\u000a      Bristol researchers gave evidence for and assistance with the Farm Animal\u000d\u000a      Welfare Council (FAWC) report on welfare of farmed animals at killing [h].\u000d\u000a      Raj is a member of the working group that contributed to the scientific\u000d\u000a      opinion on the electrical requirements for water bath stunning equipment\u000d\u000a      applicable to poultry, and leads the Scientific and Technical Advisory\u000d\u000a      Board of the farm assurance scheme \"Animal Welfare Approved\". In July\u000d\u000a      2012, members of the Bristol stunning and slaughter group (Knowles, Lines,\u000d\u000a      O'Callaghan, Raj, Wilkins and Wotton) received an award from the Humane\u000d\u000a      Slaughter Association for \"Major contributions to the science underpinning\u000d\u000a      humane livestock slaughter\".\u000d\u000a    In particular, Bristol has actively promoted dissemination of science by\u000d\u000a      developing the Animal Welfare Officer concept. This was acknowledged by\u000d\u000a      FAWC when it commented that \"The Animal Welfare Officer Course developed\u000d\u000a      by the University of Bristol Department of Animal Science has attained a\u000d\u000a      high level of recognition\" [h]. Steve Wotton, who developed the concept,\u000d\u000a      was awarded an MBE for services to animal welfare in 2007. This influence\u000d\u000a      is not limited to Europe. Largely driven by the technical specifications\u000d\u000a      of UK retailers, major exporters of poultry in the Asia and Central and\u000d\u000a      South America now also insist upon Animal Welfare Officer training for\u000d\u000a      managers within plants. Since 2008, Bristol researchers have run 61\u000d\u000a      courses which have trained over 800 delegates working in abattoirs in UK\u000d\u000a      and internationally.\u000d\u000a    Other implications for industry arising from Bristol research\u000d\u000a    Despite the significant welfare benefits of the modified stunning\u000d\u000a      parameters, further research carried out at Bristol University [i and j]\u000d\u000a      indicated that the new current\/frequency requirements would significantly\u000d\u000a      adversely affect meat quality. As a result, it has been suggested that\u000d\u000a      slaughter plants might make a move towards CO2 stunning. As\u000d\u000a      discussed by FAWC [h], gas stunning has further welfare advantages since,\u000d\u000a      unlike electrical stunning, it does not require shackling, which is a\u000d\u000a      significant aversive experience for birds. Two out of four UK\u000d\u000a      poultry-processing plants contacted for a survey of stunning practices had\u000d\u000a      switched to biphasic CO2 in January 2013.\u000d\u000a    An alternative method of dealing with the potential conflict between\u000d\u000a      using the newly stipulated electrical parameters and the need to control\u000d\u000a      carcass and meat quality, is a new `head-only' water bath stunning\u000d\u000a      technique developed in a collaboration between the University of Bristol,\u000d\u000a      Silsoe Livestock Systems Ltd, Cargill Meats and the Humane Slaughter\u000d\u000a      Association (HAS) [k]. The project was funded by Defra and the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government under the Sustainable Livestock Production LINK Programme. The\u000d\u000a      new technique involves the use of two currents &#8212; one across the head to\u000d\u000a      cause immediate insensibility and a smaller one through the body to\u000d\u000a      suppress involuntary wing flapping. The results of two studies [j, k]\u000d\u000a      carried out at Bristol indicate that head-only stunning is an effective\u000d\u000a      method of stunning birds using the criteria developed by Raj and others\u000d\u000a      and may represent a very significant improvement in carcass quality\u000d\u000a      compared with conventional water bath stunning. The application of\u000d\u000a      head-only stunning current to birds will encourage processors to apply\u000d\u000a      sufficient current that will guarantee good welfare, without significant\u000d\u000a      effect on carcass and meat quality. Head-only electric stunning therefore\u000d\u000a      has the potential to meet the commercial requirements of the processing\u000d\u000a      industry for high quality meat and a high standard of animal welfare at\u000d\u000a      slaughter. The LINK Programme Management Committee considered the\u000d\u000a      collaborative project \"...an outstanding project\", awarding a\u000d\u000a      score of 9 out of 10 for scientific content and 10 out of 10 for relevance\u000d\u000a      to the industry.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Defra-funded research at the University of Bristol showed that the water\u000d\u000a      bath stunning protocols commonly used in commercial processing plants\u000d\u000a      resulted in paralysis rather than unconsciousness in chickens during\u000d\u000a      slaughter. This finding led directly to the modification of stunning\u000d\u000a      protocols in a European Union Regulation (1099\/2009). Their practical\u000d\u000a      application within slaughter plants has been promoted to the poultry\u000d\u000a      industry in Europe and worldwide via Animal Welfare Officer (AWO) training\u000d\u000a      courses that were developed in Bristol. This has ensured that since 1st\u000d\u000a      January 2013 billions of birds in Europe are now adequately stunned, and\u000d\u000a      therefore unconscious, before they are slaughtered.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2654675","Name":"Bristol"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Raj, A.B.M., O'Callaghan, M. and Knowles, T.G.

They\u000d\u000a      proposed that the electroencephalogram (EEG) should be recorded in birds\u000d\u000a      before and after electrical water bath stunning to evaluate whether birds\u000d\u000a      had been effectively stunned.\u000d\u000a    By identifying and objectively measuring the total power content of the\u000d\u000a      pre-stun and post-polyspike EEG, they demonstrated that an effective stun\u000d\u000a      occurs if the magnitude of post-polyspike is &#8804;10% of the pre-stun value.\u000d\u000a      These criteria reliably indicate the induction of unconsciousness because\u000d\u000a      when polyspike activity, which in birds is symptomatic of epileptiform\u000d\u000a      activity, is followed by EEG suppression, the ability of the brain to\u000d\u000a      function normally, and associated consciousness, is lost.

Specifically, they showed that AC\u000d\u000a      sinusoidal frequencies above 800 Hz (see Table 1) [1] and DC waveforms\u000d\u000a      above 200 Hz [2] did not lead to an immediate state of unconsciousness,\u000d\u000a      and that increasing the AC sinusoidal frequency progressively from 50 Hz\u000d\u000a      to 800 Hz required increasing levels of applied current to produce an\u000d\u000a      effective stun [1, 2, 3].\u000d\u000a    Table 1.

The implementation of\u000a      this research in the UK has been primarily due to the active involvement\u000a      of DairyCo, which is the levy-funded, not-for-profit organisation working\u000a      on behalf of Britain's dairy farmers. The organisation has an annual\u000a      budget of over &#163;4 million for research and knowledge transfer to address\u000a      'market failure' issues in the dairy industry (i.e. to tackle issues not\u000a      currently being dealt with adequately to meet the needs of the industry).\u000a      DairyCo's animal-health knowledge-transfer programme had previously\u000a      focused on nutrition, genetics and mastitis programmes. However, in 2010\u000a      an industry collaboration led by the National Farmers Union published a\u000a      Dairy Cow Welfare strategy [a] that listed `improvement in the\u000a      recognition, treatment, prevention and control of lameness' as a key\u000a      industry priority. This specific priority was reviewed in September 2011\u000a      by the Cattle Health and Welfare Group, which is responsible for\u000a      implementing Defra's GB Animal Health and Welfare Strategy. They reported\u000a      that `DairyCo has undertaken to progress the valuable work initially\u000a        completed by Bristol University Veterinary Faculty and funded by the\u000a        Tubney Charitable Trust on dairy cow mobility' [b]. The DairyCo\u000a      dissemination materials have since been adopted by European dairy\u000a      companies and the New Zealand dairy industry. The Bristol research has had\u000a      impact in the following two main areas; Standardised Lameness Scores and\u000a      Husbandry Advisory Tools.\u000a    a) In 2008, DairyCo launched the DairyCo Mobility Score, which was based\u000a      on Bristol's Standardised Lameness Score [c]. This was followed by\u000a      a proactive DairyCo knowledge-transfer programme, aimed at farmers and\u000a      their advisors, which has included the distribution of 7,000\u000a      professionally produced DVDs, SLS scoring pads and laminated scoring cards\u000a      and 5,000 lesion-recognition cards. The SLS scoring system has been widely\u000a      adopted as a management tool on UK dairy farms. In a recent consultation\u000a      exercise undertaken by the industry's Red Tractor Assurance Scheme, 39% of\u000a      farmers reported that they carried out SLS scoring at least every three\u000a      months [d]. An important driver has been the involvement of major\u000a      retailers: in 2011, Farmers Weekly [e] reported that the scoring\u000a      system was being used by Tesco, McDonald's, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda\u000a      and Waitrose.\u000a    An important developing impact has been the inclusion of the DairyCo\u000a      Mobility Score within the Red Tractor Dairy Assurance Scheme from 2013\u000a      [f]. The scheme, which is supported by the major retailers, certifies over\u000a      90% of UK dairy production. The pilot testing of this work was supported\u000a      by the AssureWel project (www.assurewel.org)\u000a      a collaboration between Bristol University, the RSPCA and the Soil\u000a      Association. The inclusion of the SLS scoring system within this assurance\u000a      scheme means that the industry can now prioritise support for those farms\u000a      that have the highest levels of lameness. This provides a powerful new\u000a      mechanism for improving the welfare of the approximately two million dairy\u000a      cattle in the UK.\u000a    The scoring system also features in Danone's Dairy Animal Welfare\u000a        Programme [g]. Danone (Europe's largest dairy company) is promoting\u000a      use of this animal welfare programme to over 27,000 farms via its Sourcing\u000a      and Supplier Development department. The scoring system has also been\u000a      adapted for use in New Zealand which is a major dairy producer with over\u000a      11,000 farms and 4.5 million cows. The DairyNZ Healthy Hoof Lameness\u000a        Scoring [h] is now being actively promoted to all New Zealand dairy\u000a      producers.\u000a    b) Bristol research on Husbandry Advisory Tools has also had a\u000a      major impact on husbandry practices on farms. Between 2005 and 2009, the\u000a      first large-scale application of the approach was an intervention project,\u000a      the Healthy Feet Project [6], led by Bristol and involving over\u000a      200 farms. This demonstrated that implementation of the husbandry advice\u000a      within the programme reduced lameness in 73% of farms over the three-year\u000a      monitoring period, and that 52% of farms reduced lameness by more than\u000a      10%. Subsequently, an EU-supported Rural Development Programme in England\u000a      (RDPE) supported the roll-out of this lameness advice to the South West\u000a      [i]. The &#163;5 million fund to support ruminant health and welfare in the\u000a      region has involved 13 veterinary practices and, as of April 2013, 383\u000a      herds had been recruited onto the programme. Of the initial 38 herds\u000a      completing all stages of the support package, 28 had a mean 6.2% reduction\u000a      in lame animals. Other regions have also now adopted the approach with\u000a      lameness-related RDPE support. The support for the DairyCo Healthy Feet\u000a      Programme in the North West region is being evaluated. Initial findings\u000a      are very positive [j], showing that the programme has stimulated farmers\u000a      to undertake twice as many interventions to reduce lameness as farmers not\u000a      enrolled in the programme (7.9 vs 3.8 interventions per farm).\u000a    At a national level, the DairyCo Healthy Feet Programme [k] was launched\u000a      in 2011. In its 2012 annual report, DairyCo [l] described the programme as\u000a      follows: \"Based on proven research, the DairyCo Healthy Feet Programme\u000a        brings together the skills of vets, farmers and advisors, in a\u000a        structured approach to identify and tackle lameness on-farm, supported\u000a        by a comprehensive range of technical materials including foot care and\u000a        foot health recognition guides. Trained `mobility mentors' create and\u000a        deliver customised programmes culminating in a `mobility contract',\u000a        which sets out a timescale and actions to reduce the risk of lameness in\u000a        the participating herd.\" This has led to a national roll-out with a\u000a      network of approximately 100 trained `mobility mentors', including\u000a      veterinarians and members of the National Association of Cattle Foot\u000a      Trimmers, who are available to provide support to UK dairy farmers.\u000a      Bristol's influential role has been recognised within the veterinary\u000a      community: e.g. the University hosted the International Conference in\u000a      Lameness in Ruminants in August 2013.\u000a    In conclusion, Bristol's research has had a major impact on lameness\u000a        in dairy cattle in the UK and internationally. In addition to the direct\u000a        welfare benefits to the cows, reducing lameness also has positive\u000a      effects of the profitability of dairy farms. In a review of the financial\u000a        impact of lameness on the UK dairy industry in 2009 [m] the\u000a      estimated annual cost of the lameness to the typical herd was found to be\u000a      &#163;7,500, and &#163;125 million to the industry. There is therefore a significant\u000a      opportunity to increase profitability and welfare for those farms that\u000a      adopt the University of Bristol research. This is the critical\u000a      justification for the pro-active support for the knowledge transfer\u000a      programme provided by DairyCo, the National Dairy Levy Board.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dairy-cow herds in the UK and overseas, together with the dairy farming\u000a      industry, are benefiting from strategic animal-husbandry changes and\u000a      lameness-control programmes underpinned by research undertaken at the\u000a      University of Bristol since 1997. The dissemination by the UK Dairy Levy\u000a      Board of national Standardised Lameness Scores (the DairyCo\u000a      Mobility Scoring system, launched in 2008) and of Husbandry Advisory\u000a        Tools (the DairyCo Healthy Feet Programme, launched in 2011) was a\u000a      direct result of Bristol's work. It has led to the widespread adoption of\u000a      lameness scoring as a farm-management tool, the inclusion of lameness\u000a      assessment within certification schemes and a nationwide network of\u000a      trained `mobility mentors'. Where implemented, this advisory support has\u000a      resulted in a significant drop in lameness prevalence, thereby improving\u000a        welfare and reducing the economic losses associated with\u000a      treating and culling lame cows. Successful engagement with industry groups\u000a      throughout the research process has ensured that scientific outputs have\u000a      been rapidly implemented within the farming community. This approach has\u000a      been adopted internationally with the scoring system being used by\u000a      Europe's largest dairy company and a modified version is also being\u000a      promoted by the New Zealand dairy industry.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    University of Bristol\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] Whay H.R., Waterman, A.E. &amp; Webster, A.J.F.

These studies showed that dairy cattle with a\u000a      higher Standardised Lameness Score (SLS) had a reduced nociceptive\u000a      threshold that persisted for several weeks despite treatment, indicating\u000a      that lameness did indeed cause pain. This fundamental science was\u000a      important in demonstrating to policymakers that lameness was a genuine\u000a      welfare concern that mattered to the cows, in addition to being a\u000a      well-defined cause of significant productivity loss associated with\u000a      reduced milk yield, infertility and early culling.\u000a    BBRSC-funded experimental studies [i,ii] on the University of Bristol\u000a      farm then showed that housing system, diet and calving had a strong\u000a      influence on the prevalence of observable claw horn lesions [2]. More\u000a      detailed examination of the connective tissues of hooves demonstrated that\u000a      husbandry issues were associated with significant biochemical, mechanical\u000a      and histological changes around the time of calving [3]. The panel of\u000a      experts evaluating the BBSRC Responsive Mode Portfolio in March 2008\u000a      identified that the initial BBSRC funding had led to `very good\u000a        research outputs and made direct contributions to the public good'.\u000a      The husbandry risk factors contributing to lameness prevalence were then\u000a      examined in over 200 UK dairy herds in the winter of 2006\/7. This study\u000a      demonstrated a mean prevalence of 37% [4].\u000a    Using the knowledge generated in these experimental and epidemiological\u000a      studies undertaken at the University of Bristol and other institutions, a\u000a      concerted effort was made by Bristol researchers to develop Husbandry\u000a        Advisory Tools (HATS) in the form of farm-specific solutions for\u000a      farm-specific problems. In an initial investigation by Bristol [iii],\u000a      lameness was shown to be lower on those farms that adopted the husbandry\u000a      advice described in these management tools, although the level of\u000a      compliance by farmers was generally low [5]. Therefore, the next critical\u000a      step for Bristol and the industry was to design and evaluate alternative\u000a      motivational strategies to encourage improvements in lameness control.\u000a      Application of facilitation and social marketing techniques was shown to\u000a      have significant potential to reduce lameness [6]. This `Healthy Feet\u000a      Project' [iv] was undertaken in close collaboration with four dairy\u000a      companies, two certification schemes and the UK Dairy Levy Board\u000a      (DairyCo).\u000a    The evidence base arising from Bristol highlighting the extent and\u000a      severity of the welfare concern, the identification of potential husbandry\u000a      solutions and the benefits of intervention, has provided a solid\u000a      foundation for the use of Standardised Lameness Scores and Husbandry\u000a        Advisory Tools throughout the UK and internationally.\u000a    The substantial dairy-cattle lameness research at the University of\u000a      Bristol Veterinary School has involved the following key researchers: John\u000a      Webster (Lecturer 1977 to Professor 2008); John Tarlton (Research Fellow\u000a      1999 to Senior Research Fellow current); Toby Knowles (Research Associate\u000a      1990 to Professor current), Becky Whay (PhD student, 1994-1996; Research\u000a      Associate 2000 to Senior Lecturer current) and David Main (PhD student\u000a      1993-1997; Research Associate 1999 to Professor current).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40224","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Accurate diagnosis of infectious and genetic diseases is important for\u000a      the treatment and\u000a      management of cats by vets, as well as to inform breeding policy to reduce\u000a      the prevalence of\u000a      inherited genetic diseases. The infectious agents for which qPCR assays\u000a      have been developed\u000a      result in serious and welfare-compromising clinical signs in cats, which\u000a      can be fatal if these agents\u000a      are not detected and thus not treated appropriately. Upper respiratory\u000a      tract disease associated with\u000a      feline herpes virus, feline calcivirus, C. felis and B.\u000a        bronchiseptica cause ocular and nasal\u000a      discharge, pyrexia and anorexia, whilst haemoplasmas cause haemolytic\u000a      anaemia. The\u000a      retroviruses FIV and FeLV are immunosuppressive agents that are associated\u000a      with secondary\u000a      infections and neoplasia. The pioneering PCR assays described in the\u000a      underpinning research\u000a      section have led to significant commercial activity within Langford\u000a      Veterinary Services (LVS, a\u000a      wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Bristol), in excess of &#163;1.7M\u000a      to date, and the following\u000a      clinical benefits for affected cats:\u000a    An increase in the number of PCR tests\u000a        performed leading to specific treatments\u000a    The PCR assays are offered to vets and cat breeders\u000a      troughout the UK and Europe [a]. By the end of\u000a      2013, more than 53,000 PCR tests will have been\u000a      performed on over 40,000 cats since testing began in\u000a      2002. We have seen a significant increase in the\u000a      number of PCR tests run, from ~4000 per annum in\u000a      2005-2008 to over 8000 per annum in 2013 [b]\u000a      (Figure 1). Accurate detection of feline infectious\u000a      agents leads to correct treatment protocols (e.g.\u000a      doxycycline for C. felis, antivirals for FHV infection,\u000a      marbofloxacin for haemoplasmas) and significantly\u000a      improves health outcomes for infected cats. It also allows for appropriate\u000a      management (e.g.\u000a      isolation of cats, barrier nursing, keeping cats indoors, vaccination of\u000a      in-contact cats) to prevent\u000a      disease transmission [j].\u000a\u000a\u000a\u0009  \u000a    Reduction in the prevalence of inherited genetic\u000a        diseases\u000a    By genetic testing and selective breeding the\u000a      prevalence of inherited genetic disorders can be\u000a      reduced. Figure 2 shows the prevalence of the PKD\u000a      mutation in 4085 breeding cats, from 735 breeders,\u000a      tested between 2005 and 2013 [b]. There has been\u000a      a 90% reduction in the number of cats testing\u000a      positive for the PKD mutation over the 8 years\u000a      Bristol has been running the genetic test, such that\u000a      less than 5% of submitted cat samples were PKD\u000a      positive in 2013. This indicates that fewer cats will\u000a      develop chronic kidney disease due to PKD and\u000a      results in a positive impact on feline health and welfare [k].\u000a\u000a\u000a\u0009  \u000a    As a result of the Bristol genetic testing service for cat breeders, Dr\u000a      Chris Helps has been asked by\u000a      the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), the main registration body\u000a      for pedigree cats in the\u000a      UK, to collaborate on developing breed group genetic disease test panels\u000a      [c]. These will form part\u000a      of the GCCF Breeder Scheme, which aims to promote responsible cat breeding\u000a      and reduce the\u000a      prevalence of inherited genetic diseases in pedigree cats.\u000a    Number of vets and breeders using the PCR testing service\u000a    Since 2009, 705 veterinary practices and 30 referral and University\u000a      diagnostic laboratories, both in\u000a      the UK and Europe [d], have submitted samples for feline infectious\u000a      disease qPCR testing,\u000a      showing that a significant proportion (735 out of 4562 (16%, as of 2011))\u000a      of UK veterinary practices\u000a      use these diagnostic tests. In addition, since 2005 over 1900 [e] cat\u000a      breeders across Europe have\u000a      submitted samples for genetic disease PCR testing and have used the\u000a      results to inform their\u000a      breeding policy, with the ultimate aim of reducing or eliminating\u000a      inherited genetic diseases in their\u000a      breeding lines and increasing feline health. The increase in the number of\u000a      infectious disease\u000a      samples submitted clearly shows that vets are using these assays, and\u000a      hence value the results for\u000a      diagnosing and treating cats. Worldwide Guidelines, which include this\u000a      Bristol research, are now\u000a      available for vets to use to direct therapy and management on the basis of\u000a      qPCR results [l,m].\u000a    Advice calls and dissemination of information\u000a    An audit of advice calls and emails undertaken over a typical week in\u000a      November 2012 showed that\u000a      32 vets and 10 cat breeders contacted the Diagnostic Laboratory and Feline\u000a      Centre regarding\u000a      feline infectious and genetic disease PCR testing [f]. This equates to over\u000a        2000 advice calls per\u000a        year and shows that a significant number of vets and breeders are\u000a      aware of and\/or use the PCR\u000a      assays, value the results they obtain and benefit from talking to\u000a      clinicians and geneticists who can\u000a      help them interpret the results.\u000a    National and international interest in the infectious and genetic PCRs\u000a    Figure 3 shows unique page views for feline infectious\u000a    and genetic disease PCRs taken from the Langford\u000a    Veterinary Services website. Between April 2009 and\u000a    November 2012 there were over 26,000 unique page\u000a      views on 15 webpages, with the average number of\u000a    views increasing from ~3500 in 2009 to ~10,000 in\u000a    2012; a 285% increase in 3 years [g]. Looking at the\u000a    source of these unique page views shows that 41%\u000a    originated outside of the UK, with visits from 126\u000a    countries being logged [g]. This level of interest in\u000a    feline infectious and genetic disease PCRs shows\u000a    both the national and international impact of this work.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u0009\u000a    Through sharing reagents derived from the PCR assay development, a number\u000a      of other\u000a      international laboratories are now offering infectious disease testing by\u000a      PCR assays e.g. Iran,\u000a      Israel, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, Indonesia,\u000a      France, Australia, The West\u000a      Indies and USA, enabling cats worldwide to be tested for infectious agents\u000a      [h,i].\u000a    In conclusion, thanks to Bristol research, qPCR tests for feline\u000a      infectious and genetic diseases are\u000a      now widely used to benefit feline health and welfare both in the UK and\u000a      internationally. Clinical\u000a      guidance targeted at veterinary surgeons working in the UK and\u000a      internationally now also includes\u000a      recommendations to utilise these testing procedures as part of standard\u000a      practice [l,m] and the\u000a      GCCF is introducing breed-panel genetic testing in collaboration with\u000a      Bristol [c].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bristol University's School of Veterinary Sciences, a global leader in\u000a      feline medicine, was the first\u000a      UK centre to develop and commercially offer polymerase chain reaction\u000a      (PCR) and quantitative (q)\u000a      PCR assays to detect a range of feline infectious and genetic diseases.\u000a      Since 2008 there has been\u000a      a dramatic increase in the number of qPCR tests performed, with over\u000a      35,000 tests carried out\u000a      between 2008 and 2013.

Other research studies using these PCR assays have identified\u000a      risk factors for\u000a      infection and described the in vivo kinetics of infection with\u000a      feline haemoplasmas, monitored\u000a      responses to antibiotic treatment [3] and evaluated the potential routes\u000a      of transmission. Many of\u000a      the PCRs to detect inherited genetic diseases have been used to evaluate\u000a      their prevalence in cat\u000a      populations [5,6] and to monitor the change in prevalence over time. From\u000a      2002-2013, over 30\u000a      papers have been published in peer-refereed scientific journals.\u000a    Important findings from this research\u000a    \u000a      PCRs are very sensitive and specific methods for the diagnosis of\u000a        feline infectious and\u000a        genetic diseases [1,2,4].\u000a      Feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus, Chlamydophila felis\u000a        and Bordetella bronchiseptica are\u000a        significantly correlated with upper respiratory tract disease in cats\u000a        [4]. Risk factors\u000a        associated with these diseases in cats were poor hygiene, contact with\u000a        dogs with upper\u000a        respiratory tract disease and large numbers of cats housed together.\u000a      From 2005-2013, due to genetic testing and selective breeding, there\u000a        has been a 90%\u000a        reduction in the prevalence of the mutation causing PKD in the cat\u000a        population tested.\u000a      Older male non-pedigree cats are more likely to be infected with\u000a        haemoplasmas.\u000a      The feline haemoplasma, Mycoplasma haemofelis, shows cycles of\u000a        infection in vivo.\u000a\u000a      Marbofloxacin is an effective antibiotic treatment for feline\u000a        haemoplasma infection.\u000a      Doxycycline is an effective antibiotic treatment for feline\u000a        chlamydophila infection\u000a      Saliva is a possible mechanism of transmission of feline haemoplasmas.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40226","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The content and implementation of European directive 1999\/74\/EC\u000d\u000a      in January 2012 [a] which prohibits the use of conventional battery cages\u000d\u000a      for laying hens and introduces replacement, enriched cages, has had a major\u000a        impact on chicken welfare, and was significantly influenced by\u000d\u000a      Bristol University research. Cages, which previously only required 450 cm2\u000d\u000a      per bird, now require 750 cm2 per bird, with specific provision\u000d\u000a      for nest, litter and perches.\u000d\u000a    A critical milestone, necessary for the implementation of this directive,\u000d\u000a      was the formal decision by the European Commission in 2008 to go ahead\u000d\u000a      with the battery-cage ban [b]. This decision was also influenced by\u000d\u000a      Bristol research, and was made despite significant resistance from the\u000d\u000a      poultry industry and national governments across Europe. Following this\u000d\u000a      decision, and in anticipation of the directive implementation, producers\u000d\u000a      changed how they house their laying hens. Prior to 2008 enriched cages\u000d\u000a      were extremely unusual. The directive led to a rapid change between 2010\u000d\u000a      and 2012 (see figure). The number of hens in the EU reported to be in\u000d\u000a      traditional cages was 165 million birds in 2010 (32% of EU production).\u000d\u000a      However, after the traditional cage was banned the number of hens in\u000d\u000a        enriched cages was reported to be 210 million birds in 2012 (42% of EU\u000d\u000a        production). University of Bristol research directly contributed to\u000d\u000a      this major impact on production systems and animal welfare. The original\u000d\u000a      European directive, 1999\/74\/EC, was drafted following the publication of\u000d\u000a      the 1996 Opinion of the EC Scientific Veterinary Committee [d]. The report\u000d\u000a      cited the role of Bristol in developing enriched cages in research\u000d\u000a      published after 1993 [1,2]. This research was critical in demonstrating\u000d\u000a      the potential welfare benefits of enriched cages.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000a    However, some uncertainty remained about these welfare benefits. The\u000d\u000a      Commission was required to undertake a review of the implementation of the\u000d\u000a      directive, taking into account the \"pathological, zootechnical,\u000d\u000a      physiological, and ethological aspects of the various systems and of their\u000d\u000a      health and environmental impact\". The review which was completed in 2008,\u000d\u000a      was regarded by many as an opportunity to delay or even prevent\u000d\u000a      implementation of the proposed ban on traditional cages.\u000d\u000a    Even though welfare charities continued to argue that all types of cage\u000d\u000a      should be banned [e], previous scientific uncertainty about the welfare\u000d\u000a      benefits and optimum design of the enriched \/ modified cage was\u000d\u000a      highlighted by the industry. In particular the industry suggested that\u000d\u000a      mortality would be higher if space allowances were increased and that the\u000d\u000a      complex modified cage would reduce productivity and egg quality. The\u000d\u000a      industry standpoint in most EU countries was that insufficient evidence\u000d\u000a      was available for an acceptable alternative to the conventional cage. A\u000d\u000a      consortium representing egg producers throughout Europe presented a paper\u000d\u000a      to the Commission in 2007 seeking to extend the phase-out deadline from\u000d\u000a      2012 to 2017 [f].\u000d\u000a    Hence the research on the welfare impact of enriched cages was crucial to\u000d\u000a      inform the Commission Review. The scientific evidence was collated in two\u000d\u000a      critical reports. Firstly EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) considered\u000d\u000a      the relevant evidence [g], including 13 publications from Bristol.\u000d\u000a      Professor Nicol was one of the 10 members from the EU to sit on the\u000d\u000a      scientific advisory group. Secondly, an EU-funded collaborative project\u000d\u000a      (LayWel) involving eight institutions, also including Bristol, examined\u000d\u000a      the welfare implications of different husbandry systems [h].\u000d\u000a    In 2008, after reviewing the scientific evidence within the EFSA opinion\u000d\u000a      and the LayWel report, the European Commission was satisfied that the\u000d\u000a        science did justify the proposed ban on the conventional cage. The\u000d\u000a      report from the Commission stated that \"Enriched cages improve the\u000d\u000a        welfare of the animals in comparison with unenriched cage systems and\u000d\u000a        further optimisation seems possible in the future. In contrast, the\u000d\u000a        unenriched cages cause several animal welfare problems that are inherent\u000d\u000a        to the systems\". [b]\u000d\u000a    Hence Bristol research on the welfare of laying hens contributed both to\u000d\u000a      the content of the original directive and to the decision taken by the\u000d\u000a      Commission in 2008 to implement that directive. This led directly to a dramatic\u000a        change in the husbandry standards for millions of laying hens as\u000d\u000a      described in the opening paragraph.\u000d\u000a    In April 2013, the European Enforcement Network of animal welfare lawyers\u000d\u000a      and commissioners reported that all countries except Italy and Greece have\u000d\u000a      complied with the requirements for enriched cages [i]. The change in\u000d\u000a      requirements for cages and the increase in consumer awareness of\u000d\u000a      laying-hen welfare standards have also led to a reduction in the overall\u000d\u000a      proportion of hens reared in any cage (reduction from 74% to 65% in 2010).\u000d\u000a    Bristol research on enriched cages has, therefore, had a major impact\u000d\u000a        on the welfare of laying hens throughout Europe. It is clear that\u000d\u000a      this research has also had a major international influence.\u000d\u000a      Professor Nicol was funded by the New Zealand Egg Producers' Association\u000d\u000a      in 2009 to give a lecture tour explaining the reasoning and process behind\u000d\u000a      the EU ban. She also acted as a consultant in the only commercial trial of\u000d\u000a      enriched cages in New Zealand. From 2012, no new conventional cages can be\u000d\u000a      installed in New Zealand, but enriched cages will be permitted, as in\u000d\u000a      Europe [j]. Perhaps most surprisingly, despite very limited existing US\u000d\u000a      federal animal welfare law, legislation is currently being drafted based\u000d\u000a      on an historic agreement between producer organisation United Egg\u000d\u000a      Producers and The Humane Society of the United States [k]. The scientific\u000d\u000a      justification for this agreement was based on a review of which Nicol was\u000d\u000a      a co-author and a report from the HSUS which also makes extensive\u000d\u000a      reference to University of Bristol plus the EFSA and Laywel reports. The\u000d\u000a      state of California has decided to ban cages from 2015 [l]. Tasmania was\u000d\u000a      the first Australian state to declare phase-out, with no new battery cages\u000d\u000a      allowed from 2012 in Australia [m].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Hundreds of millions of laying hens in the European Community are now\u000d\u000a      kept in enriched cages with significantly more space than conventional\u000d\u000a      battery cages and with specific provision for nesting, scratching and\u000d\u000a      perching. Research undertaken at Bristol University provided much of the\u000d\u000a      evidence base for the full implementation of the relevant European\u000d\u000a      directive in January 2012; the prohibition of the conventional battery\u000d\u000a      cage and the introduction of a superior, scientifically researched\u000d\u000a      alternative. This has had a dramatic impact on husbandry standards and\u000d\u000a        the welfare of laying hens. With Bristol's involvement, similar\u000d\u000a      progress has also been made in countries beyond Europe.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2147291","Name":"State of Tasmania"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Sherwin, C.M. and Nicol, C.J.

The work was funded\u000d\u000a      by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [i] and provided vital\u000d\u000a      early information about how nests could be incorporated within a cage\u000d\u000a      system to ensure bird welfare and to minimise any adverse effects on\u000d\u000a      production (e.g., birds laying eggs on the cage floor) [1, 2]. Groups in\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh and Sweden also pilot-tested some of these early cage designs.\u000d\u000a    Bristol was then commissioned in 1997 by the Ministry of Agriculture,\u000d\u000a      Fisheries and Food (MAFF) to investigate whether dust baths could be\u000d\u000a      included within furnished cages and to identify the consequences for hen\u000d\u000a      welfare of different design solutions [ii]. This study showed that the\u000d\u000a      provision of full dust baths in a furnished cage was not a\u000d\u000a      practical proposition. However, hens were able to perform a certain degree\u000d\u000a      of dust bathing in the nest areas, partially satisfying this behavioural\u000d\u000a      need [3]. Other Bristol research showed that cage design influenced the\u000d\u000a      potential for birds to step on, and therefore damage, each other's backs\u000d\u000a      [4].\u000d\u000a    In 2000, MAFF also agreed to fund a series of commercial-scale trials as,\u000d\u000a      at that stage, the industry was reluctant to invest in new cage systems.\u000d\u000a      The trials explored the welfare impact of various cage heights, stocking\u000d\u000a      density, and floor types that could promote foraging and dustbathing. The\u000d\u000a      grant [iii] was awarded to a collaborative group including the University\u000d\u000a      of Bristol, the University of Edinburgh and de Montfort University.\u000d\u000a      Bristol researchers were specifically responsible for monitoring the\u000d\u000a      behaviour of the birds in commercial cages based at the former husbandry\u000d\u000a      trial facility, ADAS Gleadthorpe. Three designs of furnished cage, based\u000d\u000a      upon early prototypes developed by Bristol and Edinburgh researchers, were\u000d\u000a      compared with conventional battery cages. The study showed that basic and\u000d\u000a      essential behavioural needs were satisfied in the enriched cages and that,\u000d\u000a      contrary to industry concerns, mortality in enriched cages was no higher\u000d\u000a      than in conventional cages [5]. University of Bristol work on the enriched\u000d\u000a      cage design continued on a commercial scale in collaboration with ADAS.\u000d\u000a      This work also showed that certain cage-floor designs increased\u000d\u000a      dust-bathing behaviour.\u000d\u000a    In 2004, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) [iv]\u000d\u000a      commissioned the University of Bristol to conduct a fair and direct\u000d\u000a      comparison of the welfare of birds in all current cage systems to \"inform\u000a        the UK position in European negotiations\". This work showed that\u000d\u000a      many aspects of welfare were superior in furnished cages compared with\u000d\u000a      other systems [6].\u000d\u000a    Work at Bristol on laying hens has been led by Professor Christine Nicol\u000d\u000a      (Lecturer 1985-1993, Reader 1994-2001, Professor 2001 - present).

Dr Osthaus was then, in 2007, appointed to\u000d\u000a      a position at CCCU. After taking up this position, data from the studies\u000d\u000a      were analysed, written-up and published in international, peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a      journals [1,2]. The analysis and interpretation of the Millville coyote\u000d\u000a      study [1] took place in 2008 and 2009, and that for the Donkey Sanctuary\u000d\u000a      equid study took place in 2010 and 2011. Dr Osthaus was therefore\u000d\u000a      employed at CCCU while undertaking the analysis and interpretation of both\u000d\u000a      data sets, from which the impact is derived.\u000d\u000a    The results of the Millville coyote study [1] showed that, at the large\u000d\u000a      scale, captive coyotes act exactly like coyotes in the field. This allowed\u000d\u000a      previous criticism that captive animals were not good models for animals\u000d\u000a      in the wild to be dismissed. Now, solid and reliable inferences can be\u000d\u000a      made that allow research to inform conservation (allowing a greater\u000d\u000a      applicability of all such research at Millville). At the small scale,\u000d\u000a      however, analysis revealed differences in behaviour between captive and\u000d\u000a      wild animals. Specifically, the research identified stress-linked\u000d\u000a      behaviours in the captive coyotes that were subsequently addressed by\u000d\u000a      habitat enrichment.\u000d\u000a    The Donkey Sanctuary equid study [2] represented the first analysis of\u000d\u000a      social relationships in mixed herds of domestic equids, with the key\u000d\u000a      results published in 2012 [2]. This analysis of interactions between and\u000d\u000a      within species demonstrated that the animals preferred to associate with\u000d\u000a      individuals of the same equid type [2]. Hence this work demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      donkeys should be provided with another donkey as a companion and that\u000d\u000a      mules are best kept with other mules.

Since\u000a      then, it has been reared and sold in the UK as a biological control agent\u000a      (BCA) for armoured scale insects. These scale insects are serious pests of\u000a      temperate and tropical crops, both in glasshouses and in temperate and\u000a      tropical regions. Chilocorus nigritus therefore forms an important\u000a      part of the increasing armoury of BCAs available to organic growers and\u000a      those practising IPM.\u000a    All research was undertaken at CCCU by Dr Ponsonby (employed CCCU\u000a      1995 to present), who coordinated collaborations, authored papers and\u000a      supervised PhD students working on the project. Underpinning research was\u000a      published between 1998 and 2007 [1-6]. The impact claimed here relates to\u000a      the changes in protocols, practice and advice that principally derive from\u000a      the work published in 2007, and the subsequent interpretation and\u000a      application of that work (see [7]).\u000a    The key findings of the underpinning research can be summarised as\u000a      follows:\u000a    1) Climatic conditions: In collaboration with Imperial College\u000a      London and Wyebugs (a company providing insect diagnostic and support\u000a      services and the major UK supplier of C. nigritus), Dr Ponsonby\u000a      and colleagues established the climatic conditions required for the mass\u000a      rearing of C. nigritus and its main prey, Abgrallaspis\u000a        cyanophylli, and the conditions required for efficacious deployment\u000a      in glasshouses and field situations [1,2].\u000a    2) Prey-Relations and deployment: Introductions of C. nigritus\u000a      sometimes fail to establish, even when conditions are apparently\u000a      favourable. Work undertaken at CCCU from 1998 addressed the complexities\u000a      of the prey relations of C. nigritus in the context of glasshouse\u000a      use [3-6]. This research determined the prey densities necessary for\u000a      successful establishment of C. nigritus, identified the preferred\u000a      prey species\/combinations and documented indicators of plant\/prey\u000a      interactions that may affect the efficacy of C. nigritus as a BCA\u000a      [3-6].\u000a    In combination, this research led to clearly defined work practises and\u000a      the publication of definitive introduction rates for C. nigritus\u000a      [7].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42082","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    BEAA research has had continuing economic and commercial impact\u000a      throughout the REF period locally on Aber Instruments and nationally and\u000a      internationally on their distributors, customers and product consumers by\u000a      changing the methods used by practitioners in breweries and biotechnology\u000a      companies worldwide. Patenting of BEAA intellectual property has\u000a      continuing impact by protecting the market for Aber Instruments (see\u000a      section 3). The company has established its independent viability,\u000a      increased its workforce and commercialised a range of high specification\u000a      on-line instruments with worldwide patent cover, including the Futura,\u000a      which largely replaced the Biomass Monitor in 2009 for biotechnology\u000a      applications, and the development and improvement of the Yeast Monitor for\u000a      use in breweries [5.1].\u000a    Aber Instruments' Engineering Director has confirmed [5.2] that the\u000a      company \"continually works with Dr Hazel Davey and her research team in an\u000a      effort to understand cellular processes further and pass that knowledge on\u000a      to the marketplace\". He has confirmed that Dr Hazel Davey's research has\u000a      impact through \"her presentation at Aber Instruments' Distributors\u000a      Conference in May 2013 and through other avenues such as papers, websites\u000a      and posters\" and that \"this helps Aber Instruments to maintain its\u000a      presence in the marketplace and to promote its products.\" He goes on to\u000a      state that \"without this on-going work Aber Instruments would not be able\u000a      to maintain its profits\" and that \"Dr Hazel Davey's expertise on cell\u000a      vitality and the instruments that measure it is extremely useful to Aber\u000a      Instruments for exploring new market potential\".\u000a    The impact of BEAA research has significantly raised the profile of Aber\u000a      Instruments technology. This has resulted in it being considered a robust\u000a      and verified method and has led to a change in practitioner approach to\u000a      monitoring and decision making in a wide variety of processes that involve\u000a      cellular material. Aber Instruments launched its third major generation of\u000a      products, the Futura range, in 2009 [5.1]. The Futura is a new generation\u000a      of compact, lightweight biomass monitoring instrumentation that can be\u000a      used on conventional as well as disposable bioreactors. Research conducted\u000a      at the university has directly contributed to these developments by\u000a      providing methods to reduce and correct for interference in the biomass\u000a      signals. Aber Instruments' Sales and Marketing Director has confirmed that\u000a      BEAA research has led to \"an extensive list of key publications that are\u000a      often referred to by customers of Aber Instruments\" and that the two books\u000a      written by Dr Christopher Davey (see section 3) continue to be \"the\u000a      standard references used by practitioners in industries using Aber\u000a      Instruments technology\" [5.3].\u000a    In addition to the local impact on Aber Instruments, the impact of BEAA\u000a      research is much further- reaching as over 1000 systems based on the\u000a      technology that resulted from this research have been supplied worldwide\u000a      [5.1] and these are used in a wide variety of applications and sectors.\u000a      Worldwide, industries adopting Aber Instruments radio-frequency impedance\u000a      technology for fermentation and cell culture monitoring include breweries,\u000a      major biotechnology companies and increasingly biofuel plants. Thus, it\u000a      can be seen that, via Aber Instruments, the research conducted by a team\u000a      of scientists within AU is directly impacting on companies and end users\u000a      worldwide. The technology developed with input from AU staff is used for\u000a      research, process development and manufacturing by the world's leading\u000a      biotechnology companies such as Genetech, Novartis, Novo, Biogen Idec,\u000a      GlaxoSmithkline, Centocor, Sandoz, Eli Lilly and Genzyme [5.3,5.4]. The\u000a      Yeast Monitor is now established as the standard for on-line yeast\u000a      concentration measurement in large breweries including AB Inbev, SAB\u000a      Miller, Coors, Diageo, Heineken, Suntory, Kirin, Asia-Pacific and San\u000a      Miguel [5.1,5.3,5.4]. Aber Instruments' Engineering Director has confirmed\u000a      that these customers run trials prior to purchasing biomass monitoring\u000a      systems to determine cost-benefit analyses and that the \"research,\u000a      knowledge and understanding in this area lead to cost-benefit analyses\u000a      which show a typical saving in the process of 10%\" [5.2].\u000a    In the brewery industry, the approach to viability measurement developed\u000a      at AU is used mainly for on-line control of the rate and total amount of\u000a      yeast added to fermentation vessels to convert wort into beer. It is also\u000a      used for off-line measurements of yeast quality to decide the number of\u000a      times yeast can be recycled from one batch to the next. This is important\u000a      as recycling is quicker and reduces propagation and disposal costs. Aber\u000a      Instruments' Sales and Marketing Director has confirmed that on-line\u000a      pitching control alone has the following on-going benefits for breweries\u000a      adopting this technology [5.3]:\u000a    \u000a      Improving fermentation efficiency leads to cost savings of &#8364;158,184\u000a        per million hl of beer.\u000a      A reduction in labour costs of &gt;&#8364;40,000 per brewery, per annum as\u000a        the on line, automated monitoring of yeast quality and concentration\u000a        reduces the need for technical staff.\u000a      Outlay on additional fermentation vessels is reduced through improving\u000a        identification of brew completion via on-line, real-time monitoring.\u000a        This allows the fermented beverage to be processed more quickly; for\u000a        example, cutting the brew time from 5 days to 4 increases the production\u000a        of the brewery by 20% without the need for financial outlay on an extra\u000a        fermentation vessel. With each fermentation vessel and associated\u000a        instrumentation system costing approximately &#8364;700,000 this is an\u000a        important cost saving.\u000a      Better consistency of product flavour; this is especially important\u000a        for global brands where poor consistency leads to customer\u000a        dissatisfaction and loss of market share.\u000a    \u000a    Locally, Aber Instruments is benefitting from BEAA research through\u000a      growth of the company workforce and profits and opportunities for\u000a      accessing further investment in research. The impact of BEAA research has\u000a      also significantly raised the profile of Aber Instruments technology,\u000a      confirming its status as a robust and verified method and this in turn has\u000a      led to a change in practitioner approach to monitoring and decision making\u000a      in a wide variety of processes that involve cellular material. Worldwide,\u000a      industries adopting Aber Instruments radio-frequency impedance technology\u000a      for fermentation and cell culture monitoring include breweries and major\u000a      biotechnology companies. Thus, it can be seen that, via Aber Instruments,\u000a      the research conducted by a team of scientists within BEAA is directly\u000a      impacting on companies and end users worldwide.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    BEAA research has impacted positively on commerce in brewing and\u000a      biotechnology companies worldwide through continuous collaboration with\u000a      Aber Instruments, an AU spin-out company formed to commercialise\u000a      university research.

The most difficult aspect to\u000a      control is the yeast &#8212; as a biological agent both the viability and\u000a      vitality of the organism must be monitored to maximise efficiency and\u000a      product quality. As yeast is recycled from one brew to the next following\u000a      compaction, cold storage and acid washing, its quality can vary\u000a      considerably. Standard microbiological methods such as plate counts or\u000a      growth in liquid culture provide only a posteriori information\u000a      about the yeast quality &#8212; by which time the brew may have been spoiled\u000a      (leading to loss of profit, environmental issues if it requires disposal\u000a      or storage costs if it is to be blended). Historically, stain-based\u000a      methods have been used to monitor viability but these introduce errors\u000a      through sampling from a heterogeneous suspension with associated\u000a      contamination risk and increase labour costs and delays associated with\u000a      processing of the off-line sample and data.\u000a    The basis of the biomass monitoring systems developed through BEAA\u000a      research and commercialised by Aber Instruments is the real-time and\u000a      on-line radio-frequency impedance measurement of viable cell\u000a      concentration. Following on from earlier AU work, since 1993 research has\u000a      included analysis of brewer's yeast in laboratory conditions and also\u000a      under industrially-relevant challenging situations such as at high volume\u000a      fractions [3.1a] with the presence of non-biological particulates,\u000a      fluctuating or biologically-extreme temperatures, presence of gas bubbles\u000a      [3.1b], complex and variable growth media, etc. Thorough analysis of the\u000a      measuring electrodes and electronics [3.1c,d,e] has led to major\u000a      improvements in the quality and reliability of data obtained using this\u000a      methodology and these advances are the direct result of AU patents\u000a      assigned to Aber Instruments [3.2]. Additionally, the sensitivity of the\u000a      method to loss of viability, changes in cell size during growth or\u000a      nutrient limitation, aggregation of cells, fouling of electrodes etc have\u000a      all been investigated within BEAA [3.1a-e, 3.3a,b]. The publication of\u000a      this important and underpinning research has assisted the company in\u000a      improving and verifying the robustness of the technique and has shown it\u000a      to be a method that is suitable for real-world applications. This has\u000a      contributed to the acceptance of this technique as a standard approach by\u000a      practitioners within the brewing industry.\u000a    In addition to work with brewery-relevant samples, BEAA research has\u000a      included a wide range of other biological material including bacteria,\u000a      yeast, mammalian and plant cells, all at industrially-relevant volume\u000a      fractions [3.1a]. This has led to wider applicability of the technique\u000a      within the biotechnology sector (for example the technology has been\u000a      adopted by Genetech, Novo, Biogen Idec, GlaxoSmithKline, Centocor, Sandoz,\u000a      Eli Lilly and Genzyme). BEAA have also provided expert advice on potential\u000a      competitor patent applications protecting the interests of Aber\u000a      Instruments.\u000a    Currently, EU-funded research is further developing the accuracy and the\u000a      amount of additional biologically relevant information that can be\u000a      obtained from online monitoring, while DEFRA, BBSRC and ESDF (Welsh\u000a      Government) -funded projects are seeking to extend the methodology to\u000a      biofuel applications through monitoring degradation of plant material.\u000a    The original work was initiated within the research group led by\u000a      Professor Douglas Kell at Aberystwyth University. He remained active in\u000a      this area as a member of professorial staff until his move to Manchester\u000a      University in 2002. Dr Hazel Davey has taken an increasing lead in this\u000a      research as a member of staff since 1994, initially as a PDRA, Research\u000a      Fellow, Lecturer and now as a Senior Lecturer. She currently supervises\u000a      three postgraduate students who contribute to this research area. Dr\u000a      Christopher Davey is co-author with Douglas Kell of the most recent patent\u000a      [3.2] and wrote two books that are still supplied by Aber Instruments as\u000a      the standard reference for this technology [3.3 a,b]. He is now a\u000a      researcher on an open-ended contract at AU and continues to contribute in\u000a      particular to data analysis and interpretation of biomass signals.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42083","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The experimental work described above has been \"critical in providing\u000a      evidence to support\u000a      management and policy decisions in the uplands\" [5.1]. The research was\u000a      funded primarily by\u000a      DEFRA, with additional funding contributions from English Nature (now\u000a      Natural England) and the\u000a      Countryside Council for Wales (now Natural Resources Wales). Findings were\u000a      presented to and\u000a      discussed with policy officers from these government departments\/agencies\u000a      and other key\u000a      stakeholder organisations, such as the RSPB, National Trust and Welsh\u000a      Government. Through\u000a      these interactions the research has been \"important in underpinning policy\u000a      and agri-environment\u000a      scheme development in recent years\" [5.2]. In particular it has informed\u000a      the development of mixed\u000a      grazing options within the Glastir Entry (Option 15c and 15d) and Glastir\u000a      Advanced (Option 41b)\u000a      agri-environment schemes in Wales [5.1,5.2]. Glastir was launched in 2012\u000a      to replace the four\u000a      existing schemes at that time (Tir Cynnal, Tir Gofal, Tir Mynydd and the\u000a      Organic Farming\u000a      Scheme). In 2012 around 1,700 Glastir Entry (also known as All-Wales\u000a      Element) contracts were\u000a      signed, covering a total area of 154,000 ha; and around 500 of these\u000a      applicants were selected for\u000a      entry into Glastir Advanced (also known as Targeted Element). In addition,\u000a      the research findings\u000a      have informed the development of specific polices and initiatives\u000a      targeting the restoration and\u000a      maintenance of priority habitats within Wales, including support payments\u000a      to encourage cattle\u000a      grazing on Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) [5.1]. There are\u000a      currently 179 SSSIs in the\u000a      Welsh uplands, covering over 138,000 ha.\u000a    The research has also provided an evidence base for policy implementation\u000a      in England [5.3], and\u000a      within the impact assessment period influenced the development of the\u000a      priority UL18 cattle grazing\u000a      option within the Upland Entry Level Scheme (UELS; launched in 2010), and\u000a      a related\u000a      reprioritisation of the EK5 mixed grazing option within the Entry Level\u000a      Stewardship (ELS) scheme.\u000a      The cattle grazing option has been one of the most popular UELS options\u000a      across England [5.4],\u000a      and to date has been included within 3200 agreements covering an area of\u000a      nearly 200,000 ha\u000a      [5.3]. In addition to influencing the development of these environmental\u000a      schemes, output from the\u000a      research has informed the individual agreements put in place by land\u000a      management advisors to\u000a      meet the specified conservation targets for holdings entered into higher\u000a      level schemes [5.3].\u000a    As well as influencing government policy, the research has had an impact\u000a      on the work by leading\u000a      conservation bodies. For example it has \"shaped the science, practice and\u000a      policy\" of the RSPB;\u000a      informing the advisory materials they produce, the advice they give to\u000a      farmers, and the\u000a      management implemented on their own sites [5.5]. The National Trust has\u000a      similarly drawn on the\u000a      work by BEAA in respect of upland grazing systems. Management\u000a      prescriptions for upland habitats\u000a      and future research proprieties have also been influenced through Fraser's\u000a      membership of the\u000a      Upland Ecosystem Group of the Wales Biodiversity Partnership and her\u000a      appointment as a\u000a      \"recognised independent expert\" on the Moorland Grazing Group for Natural\u000a      England's Upland\u000a      Evidence Review in 2012 [5.6]. Through membership of the advisory group\u000a      for PONT (a not-for-profit\u000a      organisation affiliated to CCW\/NRW which exists to encourage and\u000a      facilitate grazing for the\u000a      benefit of the wildlife, landscape and cultural heritage of Wales) the\u000a      research has influenced\u000a      management regimes put in place as part of conservation projects across\u000a      Wales [5.1,5.7];\u000a      including the Anglesey Grazing Animals Project, the Gwendraeth Grasslands\u000a      project in\u000a      Carmarthenshire, and the Forgotten Landscape Project centred around the\u000a      Blaenavon Industrial\u000a      Landscape World Heritage Site in South Wales.\u000a    The wider environmental benefits that arise from increased efficiency of\u000a      resource use within mixed\u000a      grazing systems are associated with enhanced productivity for upland\u000a      farmers. Higher growth\u000a      rates can potentially lead to improved market returns, lower costs and\u000a      reductions in associated\u000a      greenhouse gas emissions. The advantages for producers of including\u000a      grazing by cattle were\u000a      summarised in a specific booklet prepared for farmers in Wales by Hybu Cig\u000a      Cymru (the strategic\u000a      body responsible for the promotion and development of the Welsh red meat\u000a      industry) as part of its\u000a      EU-funded Sheep and Beef Development Programme [5.8], which quotes results\u000a      from grazing\u000a      trials at Bronydd Mawr. The booklet states that in the years prior to its\u000a      publication the total number\u000a      of breeding beef females in Wales dropped by 5.5%, and that \"a\u000a      continuation with this trend could\u000a      not only impact on efficiencies of production on the farm but also have a\u000a      detrimental effect on the\u000a      Welsh landscape\". The benefits of retaining a mixture of cattle and sheep\u000a      advocated include: \"a\u000a      much higher utilisation of the pasture than sheep or cattle alone;\u000a      improvements in animal\u000a      performance; improvements in the utilisation of marginal land; more\u000a      productive swards; and\u000a      reductions in worm burdens reducing drench costs\". There is also growing\u000a      recognition of the\u000a      production benefits of utilising native grassland. One of the\u000a      opportunities for improving\u000a      sustainability within the supply chain that was highlighted by the HCC\u000a      Welsh Red Meat Roadmap\u000a      (2011) is maximising the use of grazeable habitats of principle importance\u000a      (or Section 42 habitats);\u000a      the policies and prescriptions for which have been influenced by the\u000a      research as outlined\u000a      previously. The link between environmental and economic benefits is also\u000a      recognised in a recent\u000a      report commissioned by the Farmers Union of Wales, which references work\u000a      by Fraser and Davies\u000a      on the impact of different breed types of cattle [5.9]. The research\u000a      findings relating to breed\u000a      differences and grazing options for Molinia-dominant vegetation\u000a      have also informed a recent\u000a      analysis of the likely biodiversity implications of changing livestock\u000a      numbers in the uplands [5.10];\u000a      again contributing to the on-going debate regarding the future of LFAs\u000a      within the UK.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    BEAA's large-scale research designing and testing alternative grazing\u000a      management systems for\u000a      the uplands has achieved impact on the environment and economy.\u000a      Environmental policy and its\u000a      implementation via agri-environment schemes has been directly and\u000a      indirectly influenced, with the\u000a      evidence provided by the research vital to the development of grazing\u000a      prescriptions and related\u000a      payment structures by government agencies and conservation bodies.

The\u000a      traditional basis of farming in these\u000a      areas is the keeping of breeding sheep and suckler cows, and livestock\u000a      farming has shaped, and\u000a      sometimes damaged, the upland landscape. At the time the research began\u000a      the uplands carried\u000a      around 12 million ewes and more than a million beef cows; in each case\u000a      over 60% of the UK total.\u000a      Previous hill farming research had focussed on adjusting fertiliser and\u000a      stocking rate guidelines for\u000a      re-seeded pastures. The new research by BEAA staff, Fraser (PI,\u000a      1994-present) and Davies\u000a      (Officer-in-charge, Bronydd Mawr Research Station, 1965- 2009) addressed\u000a      growing concern that\u000a      loss of cattle from upland systems following reform of the Common\u000a      Agricultural Policy (CAP) could\u000a      exacerbate biodiversity declines related to mismanagement of native\u000a      pastures, and sought to\u000a      quantify the benefits of retaining cattle within the uplands. Field-scale\u000a      studies were conducted at\u000a      the Bronydd Mawr [3.1,3.2,3.3,3.6] and Pwllpeiran [3.4,3.5] research\u000a      centres from 1998 to 2008,\u000a      with collaborative input from the University of Bristol (meat\u000a      characteristics [3.2,3.3], MLURI (upland\u000a      beef systems [3.1,3.2,3.3]) and ADAS (botanical surveying [3.4,3.5]). An\u000a      initial proof-of-principal\u000a      experiment demonstrated that mixed grazing with cattle improves production\u000a      efficiency relative to\u000a      sheep-only upland grazing systems through complimentary pasture use and\u000a      reduced parasite\u000a      burdens [3.1], strengthening the case to the farming community for\u000a      retention of cattle within the\u000a      uplands. Other studies established ways in which the production penalty of\u000a      grazing Molinia\u000a        caerulea (purple moor-grass) dominated semi-natural grasslands to\u000a      meet nature conservation\u000a      objectives could be minimised [3.2], and identified potential benefits to\u000a      the consumer of eating\u000a      meat produced from animals grazing such pastures [3.2,3.3].\u000a    Following reform of the CAP in 2003 subsidy payments became decoupled\u000a      from production. Since\u000a      then upland farmers have been offered financial incentives to manage the\u000a      land to meet nature\u000a      conservation and\/or heritage objectives. The evidence base to support the\u000a      development of grazing\u000a      prescriptions within these new agri-environment initiatives was limited\u000a      however. Similarly, although\u000a      such schemes adopted an `income forgone' approach to fixing payments there\u000a      was a dearth of\u000a      relevant data available upon which to base such calculations. Further work\u000a      by Fraser and Davies\u000a      explored options to enable livestock to be effectively used to deliver\u000a      environmental gain without\u000a      compromising overall productivity, and tested assumptions made by both\u000a      farmers and\u000a      conservationists regarding the relative economic and environmental value\u000a      of different elements\u000a      within upland livestock systems. The research confirmed the vital role\u000a      that cattle can play in\u000a      restoring and maintaining biodiversity within priority habitats regardless\u000a      of breed type [3.3,3.4,3.6],\u000a      but highlighted the need for welfare considerations to be taken into\u000a      account when using stock as a\u000a      management tool [3.4,3.5]. Likewise, site-to-site variation in level of\u000a      animal performance and\u000a      floristic responses to grazing of Molinia-dominant vegetation\u000a      communities has demonstrated\u000a      shortcomings in implementing blanket prescriptions and strengthened the\u000a      case for site-specific\u000a      conservation agreements [3.3,3.5,3.6].

BEAA has collected one of the world's largest ex-situ\u000d\u000a      collections of genetically\u000d\u000a      diverse Miscanthus outside Asia and used this to build a crop\u000d\u000a      improvement programme for UK and\u000d\u000a      Europe. This has created significant interest in the programme from\u000d\u000a      industry resulting in investment\u000d\u000a      by Ceres Inc, a US based energy crop company).

The\u000d\u000a      CBD entered into force on 29 December 1993 following the United Nations\u000d\u000a      Conference on\u000d\u000a      Environment and Development (the Rio \"Earth Summit\"). The Convention was\u000d\u000a      inspired by the\u000d\u000a      world community's growing commitment to sustainable development and\u000d\u000a      represented a dramatic\u000d\u000a      step toward the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use\u000d\u000a      of its components, and the\u000d\u000a      fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic\u000d\u000a      resources.\u000d\u000a    New crop breeding programmes are dependent on the collection and\u000d\u000a      characterisation of diverse\u000d\u000a      genetic resources. Importantly since the domestication of the staple\u000d\u000a      crops, legally binding contracts\u000d\u000a      including the CBD have been put in place to ensure that where genetic\u000d\u000a      resources are collected\u000d\u000a      from one country and commercially exploited elsewhere, the benefits of the\u000d\u000a      exploitation are shared\u000d\u000a      with the donor country.\u000d\u000a    BEAA researchers pioneered the making of new Miscanthus\u000d\u000a      collections and the negotiation of the\u000d\u000a      necessary agreements in the absence of clear national legislation for the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the\u000d\u000a      access and benefit sharing arrangements under the CBD and prior to the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the\u000d\u000a      Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing in 2011. BEAA scientists\u000d\u000a      worked closely with\u000d\u000a      DEFRA and partners in Asia to implement the CBD and access and benefit\u000d\u000a      sharing protocols\u000d\u000a      through organising joint workshops, collaborative research and legal\u000d\u000a      negotiations. For example an\u000d\u000a      International Workshop on Green Chemistry and Biomass Energy which was\u000d\u000a      jointly funded by the\u000d\u000a      National Science Council of Taiwan and the BBSRC, was held at the National\u000d\u000a      Cheng Kung\u000d\u000a      University on 3 November. Aberystwyth University and National Cheng Kung\u000d\u000a      University formally\u000d\u000a      signed a memorandum of understanding at the workshop, the signing of which\u000d\u000a      was presided over\u000d\u000a      by the vice chancellor of the Cheng Kung University and the CEO of BBSRC\u000d\u000a      [5.3].\u000d\u000a    In May 2012, Taiwan was the first Asian country to sign a full access and\u000d\u000a      benefit sharing\u000d\u000a      agreement [5.4] under the CBD framework with the UK, and this was followed\u000d\u000a      by successful\u000d\u000a      negotiations with South Korea during January 2013 to July 2013 and an\u000d\u000a      official signing in October\u000d\u000a      2013 [5.5, 5.6]. On both occasions the UK was represented by BEAA in the\u000d\u000a      negotiation. This has\u000d\u000a      created one of the first examples for implementing Nagoya protocols in the\u000d\u000a      UK and our partnering\u000d\u000a      countries. Not only have BEAA scientists implemented two international\u000d\u000a      agreements but their\u000d\u000a      experience and knowledge of setting up bi- lateral access and benefit\u000d\u000a      sharing agreements under\u000d\u000a      the CBD framework is now also being used as a proven example for others to\u000d\u000a      follow, supporting the\u000d\u000a      UK government's approach to proposed EU legislation in this area [5.7,\u000d\u000a      5.8]. This includes the UK\u000d\u000a      government's approach to the proposed \"Access to Genetic Resources and the\u000d\u000a      Fair and Equitable\u000d\u000a      Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (Nagoya Protocol):\u000d\u000a      Union implementation and\u000d\u000a      ratification\", an EU-wide legislation to be submitted to the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament which was voted\u000d\u000a      on in committee on 4 July 2013 [5.8, 5.9]. The main beneficiaries of this\u000d\u000a      policy impact are therefore\u000d\u000a      the UK government's agriculture policy legislation body (DEFRA), donor\u000d\u000a      countries in Asia,\u000d\u000a      commerce (only compliant germplasm can be commercially exploited in\u000d\u000a      signatory countries) and\u000d\u000a      the global society on the conservation of natural resources.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    BEAA has created a world leading collection of Miscanthus genetic\u000d\u000a      resources.

BEAA researchers have expanded\u000d\u000a      on these collections\u000d\u000a      and targeted germplasm which exhibits traits for agricultural production\u000d\u000a      and industrial end uses.\u000d\u000a      For the new collections from Asia, seed and rhizome have been imported,\u000d\u000a      quarantined and the\u000d\u000a      relevant necessary agreements put in place with donor countries.\u000d\u000a    Collected Miscanthus materials have been planted in trials in\u000d\u000a      Aberystwyth and in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with partners in academia and industry in the UK, continental Europe,\u000d\u000a      North America, and Asia.\u000d\u000a      Industrial partners include: Ceres Inc., E-On, Biocatalysts, Blankney\u000d\u000a      Estates, NFU and\u000d\u000a      Terravesta. Ceres signed a 15 year partnership agreement with BEAA in 2007\u000d\u000a      for the\u000d\u000a      improvement and commercialisation of Miscanthus as an energy crop.\u000d\u000a      The Miscanthus trials\u000d\u000a      have generated information on the matching of genotype to different\u000d\u000a      climates and also for\u000d\u000a      different end uses from bioenergy through to chemicals and materials.\u000d\u000a      Research in BEAA has\u000d\u000a      focused on performance of diverse Miscanthus germplasm under UK\u000d\u000a      conditions. This research\u000d\u000a      has helped to define crossing strategies and ideotypes for Miscanthus\u000d\u000a      and also through\u000d\u000a      modelling which regions in Asia contain the most desirable traits [3.4,\u000d\u000a      3.5, 3.6]. In addition DNA\u000d\u000a      based molecular markers have been developed with industry to identify\u000d\u000a      parents for wide\u000d\u000a      crosses and for use in selection programmes [3.7, 3.8].\u000d\u000a    In accordance with the guidelines of the United Nation's Convention on\u000d\u000a      Biological Diversity (CBD),\u000d\u000a      which has been ratified by 193 countries, each country is sovereign over\u000d\u000a      its own genetic resources\u000d\u000a      with the aim of governing the fair and equitable use of genetic resources.\u000d\u000a      Any new genetic\u000d\u000a      resources collected since 1992 needs to be CBD compliant. However, the\u000d\u000a      implementation of CBD\u000d\u000a      is still in its infancy and only a limited number of countries have\u000d\u000a      implemented access and benefit\u000d\u000a      sharing legislation. So far a multi-lateral mechanism for access and\u000d\u000a      benefit sharing has been put\u000d\u000a      in place for 64 main crop plants (so called Annex 1 species). Following\u000d\u000a      the adoption of the 2010\u000d\u000a      CBD protocol on access and benefit sharing in Nagoya it became possible to\u000d\u000a      enter into bi-lateral\u000d\u000a      agreements with donor countries. As Miscanthus has not been used\u000d\u000a      as a crop species to date,\u000d\u000a      BEAA scientists John Clifton-Brown (project leader, 2004-present) and Lin\u000d\u000a      Huang (researcher,\u000d\u000a      1999-present) have developed bi-lateral agreements with several donor\u000d\u000a      countries for\u000d\u000a      commercialisation of Miscanthus, one if not the first time this\u000d\u000a      has been done for any non Annex 1\u000d\u000a      crop.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42085","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The new maize variety GM-6, developed by Bangor research using the novel\u000d\u000a      methods of PPB and PVS, was successfully released in Gujarat State in 2002\u000d\u000a      and, as shown below, has had a major impact on food production in Western\u000d\u000a      India between 2008 and 2013. The relationship between the research output\u000d\u000a      (GM-6) and the impact is causal and direct and is related to the\u000d\u000a      production and economic benefits of growing GM-6 and the area upon which\u000d\u000a      it is grown. Because of careful targeting of farmers' needs during the PPB\u000d\u000a      and PVS, the high benefits gained from the new variety did not require\u000d\u000a      additional input of resources by the farmers. PPB and PVS produced a\u000d\u000a      variety that was earlier to mature than any of those produced by\u000d\u000a      conventional maize breeding, combined this trait with high yield, and took\u000d\u000a      fewer years to do so than conventional breeding methods [5.1, Witcombe et\u000d\u000a      al. 2007 (cited in section 3)].\u000d\u000a    Impact on production and international development: improved food\u000d\u000a          yield, security and economy\u000d\u000a      The impact resulting from the uptake of GM-6 on livelihoods of a sample of\u000d\u000a      farmers in three states in Western India that had previously been given\u000d\u000a      seed was surveyed [5.1]. Farmers liked the new variety for its higher\u000d\u000a      yield as well as other traits such as improved grain quality, earlier\u000d\u000a      maturity (7 days earlier silking than local varieties) and better\u000d\u000a      tolerance of major diseases and pests. Because of its early maturity, GM-6\u000d\u000a      escapes terminal drought, resulting in a much lower frequency of failed\u000d\u000a      harvests. Combined, these properties of GM-6 give a major advantage to\u000d\u000a      resource-poor farmers, allowing them to sell more grain, as well as\u000d\u000a      increasing their household food self-sufficiency. Farmers reported\u000d\u000a      considerable impacts on their livelihoods with seed sales in maize\u000d\u000a      increasing by 51% and food self-sufficiency by more than one month.\u000d\u000a      Large-scale uptake of GM-6 during the 2008-13 period is attributable to\u000d\u000a      the evidence that during its period of rapid uptake over 70% of the\u000d\u000a      farmers growing this new maize variety reported an overall increase of\u000d\u000a      more than 10% in their total income [5.1].\u000d\u000a    A comprehensive survey of the seed production records of the 13 main\u000d\u000a      responsible institutions in the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and\u000d\u000a      Rajasthan in western India by Yadavendra (2013) [5.2] showed that the\u000d\u000a      amount of GM-6 seed produced for sowing has increased rapidly from 2002 to\u000d\u000a      2013 with a notable acceleration during 2010-2013 (Figure 1 below). During\u000d\u000a      the 2008-2013 period 1519 t of GM-6 seed for sowing was produced (over 250\u000d\u000a      t per year), which represents 54% of the cumulative total seed produced\u000d\u000a      since the release of the variety in 2002. These documented values are\u000d\u000a      conservative as data are unavailable for private-sector non-certified\u000d\u000a      seed. This indicates the sustained and accelerating demand for this seed\u000d\u000a      amongst farmers. During 2008-2013 GM-6 accounted for over 91% of the total\u000d\u000a      recorded maize seed production in Gujarat State, and in each year during\u000d\u000a      2011-2013 it accounted for at least 98% of the total production (Figure 2\u000d\u000a      below, [5.2]).\u000d\u000a    Based on an average sowing rate of 20 kg seed\/ha, the 1519 t of\u000d\u000a      officially certified GM-6 seed produced since 2008 enabled 76,000 ha of\u000d\u000a      maize to be planted. Importantly, Yadavendra (2013) [5.2] determined that\u000d\u000a      the actual area of GM-6 planted is much greater than this, equating to an\u000d\u000a      estimated cumulative area of 1.08M ha since 2008. This was based on an\u000d\u000a      estimate that 4% of farmers' harvest of GM-6 is sown as seed in subsequent\u000d\u000a      years. This estimate is conservative as previous surveys [5.1] found that\u000d\u000a      farmers themselves sowed an average of 3% of the seed of GM-6 that they\u000d\u000a      harvested and distributed an additional 6% to relatives, friends and\u000d\u000a      neighbours for sowing. This estimated is further supported by the finding\u000d\u000a      of Yadavendra and Witcombe (2013) [5.1] that more than 60% of farmers who\u000d\u000a      were given GM-6 seed more than once grew it in the following year and\u000d\u000a      increased the proportion of their land area sown to this variety\u000d\u000a      year-on-year. Independent evidence for this large estimated land area\u000d\u000a      planted with GM-6 is provided by the principal maize research scientist at\u000d\u000a      the Main Maize Research Station, Gujarat Agricultural University, Godhra\u000d\u000a      who concluded from his observations that GM-6 is the most popular maize\u000d\u000a      variety in Gujarat, that it occupies a large majority of the maize area,\u000d\u000a      and that it has been grown on a cumulative area of 2M ha since its release\u000d\u000a      in 2002 [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Surveyed resource-poor farmers reported that cultivating GM-6 maize had\u000d\u000a      considerable positive impacts on their livelihoods with their maize seed\u000d\u000a      sales increasing by more than 50% and their household food supply lasting\u000d\u000a      for more than one additional month [5.1]. In addition, a majority of the\u000d\u000a      surveyed farmers growing GM-6 reported that it increased their total\u000d\u000a      income by 10-20%. Given that, on average, resource-poor households in\u000d\u000a      Gujarat each own 0.9-1 ha of land, which is only partially planted to\u000d\u000a      maize, it is estimated that the cumulative 1.08 million ha of GM-6\u000d\u000a      planting during the six years 2008-2013 equates to the livelihoods of an\u000d\u000a      average of more than 2 million household-years (333,000 households per\u000d\u000a      year) directly benefitting from GM-6. Using conservative estimates for\u000d\u000a      current value of maize grain and the estimated 30% yield advantage\u000d\u000a      obtained from cultivating GM-6 over other local varieties, GM-6 has\u000d\u000a      provided an additional harvest for farmers in Gujarat, Rajasthan and\u000d\u000a      Madhya Pradesh States of 360,000 t of food grain during 2008-2013 with a\u000d\u000a      net present value of Rs 5,600M (&#163;55M) [5.2, page 33], a major direct\u000d\u000a      impact on international development of the Bangor-led research that\u000d\u000a      created GM-6.\u000d\u000a    There are also good grounds for inferring substantial beneficial impacts\u000d\u000a      on the environment as the increased productivity of GM-6 is achieved\u000d\u000a      without the need for additional inputs, specifically water, inorganic N\u000d\u000a      and pesticides, thus reducing the burdens of water-consumption and\u000d\u000a      polluting agro-chemicals per amount of food production.\u000d\u000a\u0009  Figure 1.\u000d\u000a\u0009  Figure 2.\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a    Figure 1.

This was the first\u000d\u000a      published example (Witcombe et al. 2003) of the application of PPB in\u000d\u000a      maize, and included several research innovations to increase the\u000d\u000a      efficiency of mass selection in the crop. JRW made further innovations to\u000d\u000a      introduce properties desired by farmers, such as (i) breeding for very\u000d\u000a      early maturity and (ii) using both yellow- and white-endosperm maize as\u000d\u000a      parent varieties to combine the superior yield of yellow maize with the\u000d\u000a      preferred taste and colour of white maize.\u000d\u000a    This research produced new varieties highly adapted to the requirements\u000d\u000a      and preferences of local farmers, which greatly improved their popularity\u000d\u000a      and adoption rate. One of these varieties, GM-6, had particular strong\u000d\u000a      advantages in terms of yield (18% more than the local control variety in\u000d\u000a      research-station trials, and a 28% advantage in trials on farmers'\u000d\u000a      fields). In addition, GM-6 was superior for agronomic traits, e.g. extreme\u000d\u000a      early maturity in less than 80 days (Witcombe et al. 2003). Farmers also\u000d\u000a      highlighted GM-6's superior grain quality and the tightly packed cobs that\u000d\u000a      reduce insect attacks, as well as production of higher quality fodder,\u000d\u000a      which is a main source of animal feed. The resulting extremely high\u000d\u000a      popularity of GM-6 amongst farmers is reflected in the high adoption rate\u000d\u000a      of GM-6: between 1998 and 2000, over half the farmers that were given the\u000d\u000a      seed continued to grow it in the next year and all farmers growing GM-6\u000d\u000a      for a second year became continuing adopters, growing GM-6 on 30-100% of\u000d\u000a      their land (Witcombe et al. 2003).\u000d\u000a    This research, led by JRW, resulted in the official release of GM-6 for\u000d\u000a      the whole of the Gujarat agro-climatic zone in 2002 by the Gujarat State\u000d\u000a      Seed Certification Agency (GSSCA, Witcombe et al. 2003). It was notified\u000d\u000a      in 2003 by the central variety release committee of the Government of\u000d\u000a      India with the reference number S.O.383 (E)12-3-2003 REG\/2007\/338. It was\u000d\u000a      subsequently officially recommended for cultivation in the states of\u000d\u000a      Rajasthan (2004) and Madhya Pradesh (2005). JRW led research into the\u000d\u000a      pathway of rapid uptake of this variety by farmers in the three states\u000d\u000a      which was reported to the DfID Research into Use programme (Witcombe et\u000d\u000a      al. 2007).\u000d\u000a    The research was a collaboration between Bangor University, the\u000d\u000a      DFID-funded Krishak Bharati Cooperative Rainfed Indo-British Farming\u000d\u000a        Project (KRIBP) and Gujarat Agricultural University (GAU). All of\u000d\u000a      the breeding research was done by Bangor and KRIBP, and the on-station\u000d\u000a      testing by GAU, which also put the new varieties through the formal\u000d\u000a      testing system and jointly proposed them for release. PVS on the maize\u000d\u000a      varieties was organised by KRIBP with supervision and analysis by JRW. The\u000d\u000a      impact of the maize varieties on the livelihoods of local farmers was\u000d\u000a      surveyed by the Gramin Vikas Trust (GVT), Gujarat.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42086","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Adoption and dissemination of BG1442 variety in Nepal\u000a      The history of BG1442 perfectly illustrates the impact of PVS on\u000a      identifying varieties farmers will likely adopt. Although BG1442\u000a      had been introduced in Nepal in 1987, it had never been promoted or\u000a      officially identified. Bangor-led PVS trials with local farmers\u000a      (1996-2006) and large-scale seed distribution (2001 onwards), resulted in\u000a      rapid gain in popularity of the variety and its official release as Hardinath1\u000a      in 2004 - a process that had been completely stagnant prior to the PVS\u000a      trials. Surveys from 2008 show the magnitude of this popularity: 14-22% of\u000a      surveyed households in 10 districts grew the variety in 2008, compared\u000a      with none in 1997 [5.2,5.7]. Because it is grown in the fallow season, the\u000a      variety drastically improved not only income and food availability, but\u000a      also provided additional jobs. Rice self-sufficiency increased on average\u000a      by over 2 months (25%) and grain sales of families with surplus by 900 kg\u000a      per family (24%), [5.2,5.7].\u000a    Growth area and adoption of Ashoka varieties in India\u000a      The spread of the Ashoka varieties started in 2001 in four states\u000a      in northern India, and continues during the period 2008-2012 (Figure 1)\u000a      [5.3,5.4] extending to three additional states. In 2003, the varieties\u000a      were officially released for the first time in Jharkhand State and were\u000a      recommended for cultivation in Gujarat and Rajasthan through the State\u000a      Agricultural Universities by 2005. These varieties have been adopted for\u000a      certified seed production and, through the dissemination grants (RF, DFID)\u000a      secured by Bangor, expansion of seed distribution continues throughout\u000a      northern India and seed production levels since 2008 represent over 40% of\u000a      the total recorded seed production of the Ashoka varieties (Figure\u000a        1). By 2012, more than 900 t of seed had been distributed to over\u000a      226,000 farmers in villages throughout northern and central India (over\u000a      50% of these farmers were reached since 2008) [5.3, 5.4].\u000a    A survey in 2008 [5.1] showed that 95% of farmers who had been given seed\u000a      4-6 years earlier, continued to grow Ashoka despite no further\u000a      outside intervention, revealing its high acceptability. Farmers had\u000a      distributed seed within their villages and to other villages over\u000a      distances of up to 500 km. Many of these recipient villages had as high a\u000a      level of adoption as villages in which seed had been initially supplied\u000a      [5.1]. Seven years after its release, Ashoka was grown on 40-76%\u000a      of the available land of adopting farmers in the five study districts in\u000a      four states; while, for comparison, the popular public-sector variety\u000a      Vandana was grown on just 0-5% of available land 16 years after its\u000a      release [5.1 (Table 27)]. By 2008, in the five surveyed districts an\u000a      estimated 177,000 farmers were growing Ashoka varieties on\u000a      approximately 26,600 ha. Since seed of Ashoka had already been\u000a      distributed in over 1,000 villages by 2007 [5.1 (Figure 1] and high\u000a      farmer-to-farmer spread had been found, it was assumed (conservatively by\u000a      using low-end estimates) that adoption rates could be extrapolated across\u000a      the upland rice areas in all of the districts in the four states. Hence,\u000a      it was estimated that 420,000 ha were planted to Ashoka varieties by 2.8M\u000a      households by 2008 [5.1(Table 26)]. There is no post-2008 survey, but\u000a      since the number of farmers that was reached by subsequent dissemination\u000a      projects more than doubled (Figure 1) [5.4,5.5] and in view of the\u000a      expected substantial farmer-to-farmer spread, it is deduced that the areas\u000a      and households have substantially increased by 2013 from the 2008 levels.\u000a      Moreover, the varieties have been widely distributed in the neighbouring,\u000a      but not surveyed, states of Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, and Uttar\u000a      Pradesh.\u000a    Economic and welfare benefits of growing Ashoka\u000a      The Ashoka varieties are popular for their high yield (~15% higher\u000a      [5.1]), grain quality, superior taste, and fodder yield. Their early\u000a      harvest provides food during lean periods and pest-and drought-resistance\u000a      result in low costs and labour requirement. 83% of surveyed Ashoka users\u000a      reported increased rice availability in 2008, with a mean increase in rice\u000a      self-sufficiency of almost one month (17%). These direct benefits can\u000a      allow farmers to plant an additional crop or devote time to\u000a      non-agricultural activities, providing extra income and permitting them to\u000a      send their children to school [5.1]. Grain sales also increased by on\u000a      average 150 kg (46%) and farmers benefited from more, higher-quality grain\u000a      receiving a better price. Based on an additional 15% yield on 700 kg\u000a      grain\/ha, and a conservative market value of &#163;400\/t, the Ashoka varieties\u000a      in India were estimated to provide a financial benefit of about &#163;17M per\u000a      annum in 2008 - a benefit that would have accrued annually from 2009-2013\u000a      [5.1 (page 33),5.4].\u000a    Growth area and adoption of COB varieties in Nepal\u000a      The first Bangor COB variety (Bharke-3004) was officially released\u000a      in Nepal in 2006, the second (Sunaulo Sugandha) in 2008, and the\u000a      third Barkhe-3010 in 2009. Barkhe-1027 and Barkhe-2014\u000a      followed in 2012 and by that time these, together with the unreleased\u000a      varieties, had spread over 18 districts across the Terai. Between 2008 and\u000a      2012, seed kits were distributed to over 146,000 households [5.5] and were\u000a      more popular than varieties developed by Nepal Agricultural Research\u000a      Council (NARC) released in the same period: 10-16% of surveyed households\u000a      adopted the COB varieties, as opposed to 6-8% for the NARC varieties\u000a      [5.6]. 75% of the COB-variety users reported additional yields of 1 t\/ha,\u000a      equivalent to two months of rice self-sufficiency, bringing approximate\u000a      rice grain self-sufficiency to the poorest farmers, or a 12% increase in\u000a      sales (300 kg on average) for more affluent farmers [5.2]. By 2012, the\u000a      varieties were grown on at least 50,000 ha by 275,000 households in Nepal,\u000a      thereby directly benefitting over 1M people [5.2, 5.5]. This highlights\u000a      the benefits of Witcombe's COB approach compared with traditional breeding\u000a      of new varieties: despite its simplicity and low costs, its adaptability\u000a      to farmers' needs makes it highly successful, far-reaching and significant\u000a      in impacting on farmers' livelihoods.\u000a    Combined, the rice varieties developed through the Bangor research and\u000a      disseminated widely in Nepal and India by our partners, have improved\u000a        the livelihoods of millions of people; they are grown on at least\u000a      500,000 ha in India and Nepal and provide higher yields of better quality\u000a      with no need for greater agronomic inputs, to the poorest farmers across a\u000a      wide range of rice-growing environments.\u000a    \u000a    Figure 1.

(2005))\u000a      that has participatory varietal selection (PVS) as an integral component.\u000a      PVS was developed by Bangor University research in 1996 as a new\u000a      innovative method of collaboration between scientists and farmers in\u000a      field-evaluation of varieties (Witcombe et al. 1996; Joshi &amp; Witcombe\u000a      1996). It has been incorporated into national and international\u000a      agricultural research and extension systems. In Nepal, Witcombe has used\u000a      PVS to improve the dissemination and adoption of crop varieties with great\u000a      success (Joshi &amp; Witcombe 1996). One of the best examples involves the\u000a      promotion of high-yielding rice variety BG1442 through PVS:\u000a      between 1996 and 2002, Bangor researchers led by Witcombe undertook\u000a      farm-based PVS trials in 20 lowland districts in Nepal to improve\u000a      knowledge of, and access to, suitable rice varieties for resource-poor\u000a      farmers. Farmers chose BG1442 from these trials because of its\u000a      high yield and suitability to grow during the fallow season. DFID-funded\u000a      projects since 2001 further advanced the promotion of this variety in\u000a      collaboration with the Local Initiatives for Biodiversity in Research and\u000a      Development (LI-BIRD) and the Forum for Rural Welfare and Agricultural\u000a      Reform for Development (FORWARD) (Joshi et al. 2012).\u000a    In addition to PVS on BG1442, between 1996 and 1998, Bangor\u000a      research (DFID funded) developed ten new rice varieties from crosses\u000a      identified for their advantageous properties. For Nepal, eight COB\u000a      varieties were derived from three crosses between 1996 and 1998. For\u000a      India, Ashoka varieties 200F and 228 were created\u000a      (Virk et al. 2003) through COB and PVS in Jharkhand state (Witcombe et al.\u000a      2013).\u000a    The resulting new varieties were superior in their good taste, drought\u000a      tolerance and high pest-resistance properties and consistently higher\u000a      grain and straw yield across a wide environmental range in India and\u000a      Nepal. The success of the varieties led to two major grants for their\u000a      dissemination. A Rockefeller Foundation (RF) grant to Bangor (2005-2009)\u000a      funded dissemination of the two drought-tolerant Ashoka rice varieties in\u000a      four states in Northern India, and two subsequent DFID grants (Innovation\u000a      Challenge Fund 2008-2010, Best Bets 2010-2012) funded the scaling-up of\u000a      these varieties and the COB varieties from Nepal in a 30-partner project\u000a      in India and Nepal. For India, local collaborators were the Gramin Vikas\u000a      Trust (GVT) Ranchi and Birsa Agricultural University (BAU); for Nepal, the\u000a      NGOs LI-BIRD and FORWARD.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42087","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    BEAA research by Lawther formed the basis for a series of patents on the\u000a      fractionation of oats, which were central to the development of a number\u000a      of BioVelop products and responsible for its large commercial success.\u000a      BioVelop specializes in the development and scaling-up of cornerstone\u000a      technologies relating to the chemical-free extraction of functional\u000a      ingredients from cereal grains and brans. Specifically, BioVelop produces\u000a      five oat fibre derived products (PromOatTM, released 2010;\u000a      AvenaCareTM, released 2011; PrOAteinTM, released\u000a      2012; Oat insoluble fibre and Oat Maltodextrin, released 2013) as a direct\u000a      impact of BEAA research [5.1].\u000a    PromOat is a betaglucan (hemicellulose) soluble fibre-rich ingredient\u000a      sold as a nutraceutical for its beneficial effects on maintaining healthy\u000a      cholesterol levels. It has a number of allowed health claims, including\u000a      those which have been approved by the European Food Safety Authority, the\u000a      Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, for lowering cholesterol\u000a      and reducing post- prandial glycaemic response. Because of these health\u000a      benefits and its binding and emulsifying properties, PromOat is a very\u000a      attractive additive for many food products, ranging from low fat sauces\u000a      and dressings, to yoghurts, baked goods, meat products and ready meals.\u000a      Thereby, BEAA research not only provides commercial benefits to BioVelop,\u000a      but additional health benefits to consumers of a range of food products\u000a      [5.1].\u000a    PromOat was released on the market in 2010 and by 2012 a biorefinery had\u000a      been built for the commercialisation and upscaling of production for\u000a      BioVelop's patented oat products. PromOat retails for at least &#8364;15 per kg\u000a      and with a cost for the raw ingredients of only &#8364;0.20, provides a high\u000a      commercial benefit to Biovelop. Currently, the entire production capacity\u000a      of the refinery is used and produces 180 tonnes of PromOat&#8482; per year with\u000a      an annual value of &#8364;600,000 [5.2]. In recognition of the importance of\u000a      this technology and its application in the food sector, PromOat was\u000a      awarded Best Natural Ingredient for Functional Drinks at the Beverage\u000a      Innovation awards in 2011 [5.3].\u000a    PrOAtein, a protein and oil rich ingredient, and Oat insoluble fibre,\u000a      have been sold successfully and increasingly since 2012 and 2013\u000a      respectively. Oat Maltodextrin was made ready for market in July 2013\u000a      [5.2]. Avenacare&#8482; is BioVelop's first personal care product. This\u000a      hypoallergenic liquid form of oat betaglucan, was commercially released in\u000a      2011 and is incorporated into a wide variety of skin care, hair care,\u000a      personal care and baby care products to deliver the well-recognized and\u000a      scientifically-substantiated benefits of oats. Its soothing, revitalising\u000a      and strengthening properties have made this a highly successful product\u000a      selling at &#8364;20 per litre [5.4].\u000a    The commercial impact of BEAA research for the commercialisation of\u000a      fractionated biomass is further reflected in the success of Biovelop on\u000a      the international market. In May 2013, Tate &amp; Lyle, one of the world's\u000a      leading providers of specialty food ingredients and solutions, acquired\u000a      Biovelop, to expand its production of oat betaglucan as PromOat and\u000a      AvenaCare [5.5]. As a consequence of this takeover, the production\u000a      capacity of PromOat is being expanded to be more than tripled during the\u000a      last 12-18 months [5.2]. As the patents are worldwide and held until at\u000a      least 2022, continued success of the sales of these products derived from\u000a      the BEAA technology is near guaranteed.\u000a    This research also demonstrated the potential of plant biomass to replace\u000a      fossil fuel derived products and provided important background for the\u000a      funding of new commercially focused projects such as the &#163;10M investment\u000a      by the Welsh European Funding Office in the BEACON Biorefining Centre of\u000a      Excellence involving BEAA scientists (Iain Donnison, Rob Elias, Joe\u000a      Gallagher, Adam Charlton, Ana Winters) with commercial partners and\u000a      investment. BEACON provides a mechanism by which academia and businesses\u000a      can collaborate and so far it has assisted 45 enterprises, entered\u000a      collaborative R&amp;D projects with 14 companies and induced investment of\u000a      &#163;3.6M. The focus of BEACON is therefore on the translation of academic\u000a      research to create new products and processes. For example within BEACON\u000a      oat phenolics (avenanthramides) are being profiled from BEAA bred oat\u000a      varieties for use as active ingredients in skin care products, and xylose\u000a      is being recovered from oat hulls and converting to xylitol. The EU\u000a      Climate-KIC project \"ADMIT BioSuccinovate\" is developing the process for\u000a      conversion of xylose to xylitol. The &#8364;13M project led by David Bryant in\u000a      BEAA involves the fractionation of cereal straw with the primary objective\u000a      of determining sustainable and economic commercial grade bio-succinate\u000a      production from next generation C6 sugars. The work has therefore gone\u000a      beyond the impact with BioVelop to create a lasting legacy and a culture\u000a      of industry relevant research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Yield of valuable biomass fibre components and their utilization in the\u000a      food industry has been maximised by novel, cost-effective and\u000a      environment-friendly plant fibre extraction methods developed by BEAA.\u000a      Specifically, application of these methods enabled patenting and\u000a      commercialisation of oat fibre extraction by the Swedish company BioVelop,\u000a      directly resulting in commercial impact through international sales of\u000a      five nutritional products released since 2010.

The initial focus of this work\u000a      was the characterisation and fractional extraction of plant lignins and\u000a      polysaccharides, in order to study the components in detail and isolate\u000a      those relevant for industrial applications. Prior to this research, this\u000a      biomass was insufficiently characterised to enable full exploitation of\u000a      the potential benefits as an industrial feedstock and\/or human and animal\u000a      feed. In particular BEAA researchers mapped out and underpinned the need\u000a      to combine specific dry and wet techniques in preparing biomass for\u000a      wet-fractionation, leading to isolation of various cell wall, extractive\u000a      and matrix components which was achieved in subsequent research for wheat\u000a      [3.4] and demonstrated the generality of these methods amongst crops,\u000a      including for abaca fibre [3.5].\u000a    The research was led by BEAA in the BioComposites Centre by Dr Mark\u000a      Lawther (1986-1996) with research scientists Dr R.C. Sun (1996-2007) and\u000a      Dr J.M. Fang (1999-2005) and Director Dr A.J. Bolton (1989-1999). Prof\u000a      W.B. Banks (1977-1997) in the School of Agricultural and Forest Sciences\u000a      co-initiated the research programme with Lawther in the period up to 1997.\u000a      In the period 1993-2003, BEAA researchers generated over 80 papers in this\u000a      field of work.\u000a    The separation, isolation and characterisation techniques developed,\u000a      which span enzymatic, chemical and physical methods, were combined in\u000a      novel ways that led to maximisation of yields of selected components of\u000a      target biomass [3.6]. Through this work, the BEAA research demonstrated\u000a      for the first time the potential of biomass such as wheat straw as a raw\u000a      material for new markets, through replacement of non-UK or\u000a      environmentally-damaging materials with chemical fractions derived from\u000a      agricultural biomass. Because of this innovative approach, BEAA\u000a      methodology has made valuable plant products, previously inaccessible due\u000a      to their high cost or complex and environmentally unfriendly means of\u000a      extraction, accessible for food, feed and other industry and an attractive\u000a      and affordable alternative for synthetic or semi-synthetic alternatives.\u000a      The research was supported by a number of grants from MAFF (subsequently\u000a      DEFRA) [3.7, 3.8] and also led to patents which were central to the\u000a      development of a number of products [3.9, 3.10].\u000a    The research was utilised 2001-2009 by Prof. Mark Lawther with the\u000a      company BioVelop A\/S (which became BioVelop International AB in 2005), as\u000a      the underpinning basis to further develop (and up-scale) sequential\u000a      enzymatic and physical processes for the wet-fractionation of cereal\u000a      (wheat, oat, barley and rye) brans into fibre (lignocellulose), soluble\u000a      fibre (hemicellulose), protein and oil, starch dextrin and oligosaccharide\u000a      (low molecular weight hemicellulosic) fractions. These are effectively new\u000a      ingredients which have substantial value in the food and personal care\u000a      sectors and were commercially released from 2010.\u000a    In addition to commercial impact for Biovelop, the BEAA research was also\u000a      instrumental in demonstrating the potential of plant biomass to replace\u000a      fossil fuel derived products and played important contributions in the\u000a      funding of new commercially focused projects such as the &#163;10M investment\u000a      by the Welsh European Funding Office in the BEACON Biorefining Centre of\u000a      Excellence involving BEAA scientists [3.11].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42088","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    HHB67-Improved was the first pearl millet variety produced by DNA\u000d\u000a      marker-assisted-selection to reach farmers in India.

Such vast expansions of growth reflect the popularity of the\u000d\u000a      new variety.\u000d\u000a    Based on an average farm size of 2 ha, supporting a family of eight\u000d\u000a      [5.3], HHB67-Improved has brought greater food security to\u000d\u000a      approximately 3 million people in North-West India, in particular\u000d\u000a      resource-poor farmers whose cultivation of the original variety HHB67\u000d\u000a      left their food security highly vulnerable to downy mildew. Compared with\u000d\u000a      the original HHB67, HHB67-Improved provides larger grain\u000d\u000a      yields (about 10%), worth &#163;2.6M per year in central and western parts of\u000d\u000a      Rajasthan. Its improved downy mildew resistance has prevented losses of\u000d\u000a      over &#163;7M: the expected costs in the first year of a major downy mildew\u000d\u000a      outbreak (assuming 30% loss in harvest from 550,000 ha, yielding 700 kg\/ha\u000d\u000a      and a grain price of Rs 5\/kg) [5.2, 5.4]. Compared with HHB67 and\u000d\u000a      other local varieties in Rajasthan and Haryana, HHB67-Improved\u000d\u000a      gave a net benefit of Rs 544M (&#163;6.5M) in 2011 alone [5.1]. The higher\u000d\u000a      yield and early maturity of this staple also released land for crop\u000d\u000a      diversification with sesame and food legumes. Furthermore, HHB67-Improved\u000d\u000a      enabled farmers to continue with the advantageous practice of the\u000d\u000a      cultivation of a second crop, like wheat or chickpea, during the\u000d\u000a      post-rainy season, thus effectively transforming single-crop lands into\u000d\u000a      two-season multicrop fields. This doubled cropping intensity provides\u000d\u000a      resilient farming systems, substantially increased income and improved\u000d\u000a      nutrition compared with systems based on the previously grown pearl millet\u000d\u000a      landraces [5.1, 5.4].\u000d\u000a    Commercial impact for those involved in seed production and\u000d\u000a          improved measures of gender equality\u000d\u000a      In addition to direct benefits to grain farmers, the production of hybrid\u000d\u000a      seed benefits a whole industry of irrigated seed producing farmers who, on\u000d\u000a      average, see 12 times higher net returns than rainfed grain and stover\u000d\u000a      farms. In 2011, the production of HHB67-Improved seed gave a net\u000d\u000a      income of Rs 300M (&#163;3.6M) to the seed producers in Andhra Pradesh [5.1]\u000d\u000a      and further generated 186 person days per ha of employment, resulting in a\u000d\u000a      total of 900,000 person days of employment in 2011 alone, of which 45%\u000d\u000a      comprised women labourers [5.1, 5.4]. Women hired in seed production\u000d\u000a      account for twice the total labour days of men, demonstrating the improved\u000d\u000a      gender equality and significant increase in employment opportunities for\u000d\u000a      women in seed production regions and villages resulting from the improved\u000d\u000a      hybrid availability [5.1]. As seed production takes place at times and in\u000d\u000a      regions different to the main millet harvest, these benefits reach\u000d\u000a      additional households [5.3].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research using novel techniques of genetic marker-aided selection enabled\u000d\u000a      the development of new high yield, disease- and drought-resistant pearl\u000d\u000a      millet hybrids, of which HHB67-Improved was released throughout\u000d\u000a      India.

In India, where 40% (9M ha) of the\u000d\u000a      world's millet is grown, at least 70% consists of genetically uniform\u000d\u000a      hybrids, particularly vulnerable to downy mildew, the single most\u000d\u000a      destructive pearl millet disease. Epidemics can cause reductions in total\u000d\u000a      harvests of 30% or more. As the crop is rain-fed, scant and unreliable\u000d\u000a      rainfall can further drastically reduce yield. Grown by the poorest\u000d\u000a      farmers cultivating the least favourable land, pearl millet stands between\u000d\u000a      famine and food sufficiency for many families, and improving downy mildew\u000d\u000a      resistance and yield in a widely grown drought tolerant variety such as HHB67\u000d\u000a      has had a major impact on improving food security.\u000d\u000a    Collaborative research by the Centre for Arid Zone Studies (now Centre\u000d\u000a      for Advanced Research in International Agricultural Development, CARIAD)\u000d\u000a      at Bangor University, the Institute of Grassland and Environmental\u000d\u000a      Research (now Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences,\u000d\u000a      IBERS) at Aberystwyth, the International Crops Research Institute for the\u000d\u000a      Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and the John Innes Centre used a combination\u000d\u000a      of traditional techniques and the novel method of genetic marker-assisted\u000d\u000a      backcrossing selection to develop improved hybrids of pearl millet, as\u000d\u000a      part of the DFID-funded Plant Sciences Research Programme. This\u000d\u000a      collaborative research since 1993 by Professor Witcombe (1990-present), Dr\u000d\u000a      Yadav (researcher 1996-present), Dr Howarth (researcher 1985-present) and\u000d\u000a      Dr Breese (researcher 1996-2006) in BEAA produced a number of new genetic\u000d\u000a      resources, including the first ever molecular marker map in pearl millet\u000d\u000a      [3.1], and maps of the genetic basis of specific traits such as disease\u000d\u000a      resistance [3.2, 3.3], and yield. These were a prerequisite for the\u000d\u000a      subsequent marker-assisted breeding in millet [3.4].\u000d\u000a    This research enabled the subsequent transfer of downy mildew resistance\u000d\u000a      into the popular millet variety HHB67 [3.5] using marker-assisted\u000d\u000a      backcrossing [3.6], a new model for hybrid breeding combining traditional\u000d\u000a      techniques and the high-tech method of genetic marker-assisted selection\u000d\u000a      to introduce the mapped downy mildew traits into a new cross. HHB67\u000d\u000a      was widely grown (about 550,000 ha) by resource-poor farmers in Northern\u000d\u000a      India but was becoming very susceptible to downy mildew. The aim of our\u000d\u000a      research was to retain the advantageous traits of HHB67 (high\u000d\u000a      yield and drought escape through very early maturity) whilst improving\u000d\u000a      downy mildew resistance.\u000d\u000a    Genetic markers for downy mildew resistance identified by BEAA from the\u000d\u000a      ICMP451 parent were used to backcross a downy mildew resistance\u000d\u000a      quantitative trait locus (QTL) into the male-parent of HHB67.\u000d\u000a      Subsequent screening to confirm downy mildew resistance in the backcross\u000d\u000a      progeny was done by BEAA and ICRISAT by 2000. Using marker-assisted\u000d\u000a      backcrossing allowed quick identification of resistance traits in the\u000d\u000a      laboratory through analysis of the plant's DNA, a much faster and more\u000d\u000a      reliable process than field trials. Conventional backcross transfer of\u000d\u000a      downy mildew resistance to a parental donor plant of HHB67 took\u000d\u000a      nearly nine years (1991-1999), while novel marker-assisted backcross\u000d\u000a      transfer was completed in just over three years (1997-2000), once the\u000d\u000a      markers had been developed and marker-trait associations established.\u000d\u000a    Field screening of the best backcross products at ICRISAT and downy\u000d\u000a      mildew screening at BEAA was followed by field testing of the best of\u000d\u000a      these in Northern India in 2001-2004. From these trials, the best line not\u000d\u000a      only had improved downy mildew resistance but, through beneficial\u000d\u000a      non-target contributions from ICMP451, 5-10 % more grain and stover yield\u000d\u000a      than the original HHB67 [3.5].

Humphreys (Aberyswyth,1977-2008) and\u000a      other\u000a      researchers within BEAA hypothesised that increasing the water soluble\u000a      carbohydrate (WSC)\u000a      fraction of grasses would lead to improved ruminant utilisation. Since\u000a      this time underpinning\u000a      research on the biochemistry, metabolism, enzymology and genetics of WSC\u000a      (fructan) metabolism\u000a      in perennial ryegrass has been carried out by Thomas (Aberystwyth,\u000a      1972-2007), Cairns\u000a      (Aberystwyth, 1986-2010), Lovatt (Aberystwyth, 1974-present) and Armstead\u000a      (Aberystwyth, 1991-\u000a      present) [3.1, 3.2]. Similarly an understanding of the microbial\u000a      utilisation of protein and\u000a      carbohydrate in the rumen (Kim: Aberystwyth, 2001-2011, Lee: Aberystwyth,\u000a      2001-2013, Moorby:\u000a      Aberystwyth, 1993- present &amp; Scollan: Aberystwyth, 1993- present) was\u000a      built up and established\u000a      the rationale for high WSC as a key breeding target [3.3-3.6]. The BEAA\u000a      diploid ryegrass breeding\u000a      program, has exploited this research to breed HSG varieties, utilising a\u000a      mixture of spaced plant\u000a      assessment and half-sibling plot performance as a basis for half-sibling\u000a      recurrent selection over\u000a      many generations. The impact of HSG on the livestock sector has been\u000a      significant and in\u000a      recognition of this, the HSG perennial ryegrass variety AberDart was\u000a      awarded the NIAB Cup in\u000a      2003, the first forage grass to receive this award [3.7], and has remained\u000a      on the UK National (NL)\u000a      and Recommended Lists (RL) [3.7].\u000a    The intermediate heading date breeding programme is now entering the 14th\u000a      generation of\u000a      selection, while the late heading breeding programme is now in the 5th\u000a      generation of selection.\u000a      These diploid varieties are chromosome doubled to form the cornerstone of\u000a      the tetraploid and\u000a      hybrid ryegrass breeding schemes [3.1]. Varieties, diploid, tetraploid and\u000a      hybrid, have been\u000a      assessed in vitro and in vivo experiments to qualify and quantify the\u000a      effect of high WSC on rumen\u000a      microflora and digestion, milk and meat production and the effect they\u000a      have upon protein\u000a      utilisation, including the reduction in ruminant greenhouse gas emissions\u000a      [3.3-3.6,3.8]. We also\u000a      showed that higher WSC in HSG varieties provides additional energy that\u000a      improves the efficiency\u000a      of plant protein conversion in ruminants [3.4]. Mapping populations have\u000a      also been created from\u000a      HSG varieties to investigate the genetics of the trait [3.2]. Experimental\u000a      observations and\u000a      conclusions have been used to feed back into the breeding programmes to\u000a      further improve new\u000a      varieties for this trait.\u000a    HSG perennial ryegrass varieties, bred within BEAA have been shown to\u000a      increase milk production\u000a      by up to 6% per cow over the grazing season, increase dry matter intake by\u000a      up to 2 kg per head\u000a      per day and a 3% improvement in diet digestibility [3.5]. Research on beef\u000a      showed that HSG\u000a      varieties increased forage intake by around 25%, contributing to 18-35%\u000a      higher daily live weight\u000a      gain and therefore enabling slaughter weights to be reached more quickly\u000a      [3.4]. In the lamb sector,\u000a      HSG's have led to a 10-15% higher daily live weight gains with a 20%\u000a      higher carrying capacity of\u000a      swards containing the HSG varieties [3.6].\u000a    The positive environmental effects of HSG in livestock production can be\u000a      estimated. Livestock\u000a      account for approximately 37% of all emissions of methane (CH4),\u000a      which has 20-25 times the\u000a      global warming potential of CO2. Studies undertaken within BEAA\u000a      has demonstrated that on\u000a      average a lamb fed with the HSG variety released 20% less CH4\u000a      than a lamb fed with the control\u000a      variety [3.8]. Livestock account for approximately 85% ammonia emissions,\u000a      whose breakdown\u000a      products include nitrous oxide (N2O), which has ~250-310 times\u000a      the global warming potential of\u000a      CO2. In three zero-grazing trials undertaken within BEAA, the\u000a      amount of feed nitrogen (N) lost in\u000a      the urine was reduced by up to 24% [3.3-3.5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42090","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    BEAA's research on oat genetics has made a significant contribution to\u000d\u000a      the breeding of innovative\u000d\u000a      oat varieties that have had considerable impact [5.1].

This coincides with the publication of the\u000d\u000a      health claim on oats by the\u000d\u000a      EU [5.3] that accepts that eating oats contributes to a reduced risk of\u000d\u000a      coronary heart disease\u000d\u000a      because of their &#946;-glucan content. BEAA's research on variation in\u000d\u000a      &#946;-glucan content in oats has\u000d\u000a      identified sources of high &#946;-glucan that has been incorporated into the\u000d\u000a      winter and spring oat\u000d\u000a      breeding programmes, providing suitable varieties for the UK milling\u000d\u000a      industry. The BEAA oat\u000d\u000a      breeding programmes account for approximately 65% of the oats used within\u000d\u000a      the UK [5.4] and\u000d\u000a      varieties from that programme contribute to market diversification in oat\u000d\u000a      based products within the\u000d\u000a      breakfast cereal market and for snacks or light meals for consumers. There\u000d\u000a      is a growing demand in\u000d\u000a      the UK for on-the-go convenient breakfast foods. As a result, consumers\u000d\u000a      are increasingly opting for\u000d\u000a      cereal bars, instant porridge and other breakfast solutions. The oat\u000d\u000a      varieties bred by BEAA are\u000d\u000a      marketed through a strategic alliance with the company Senova [5.5]. The\u000d\u000a      utility of the new oat\u000d\u000a      varieties in terms of milling quality is tested in collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      British Oat and Barley Millers\u000d\u000a      Association, which represents the major oat milling companies within the\u000d\u000a      UK. In 2012, the quantity\u000d\u000a      of oats used within the UK was ca.700,000t of which 65,000t was imported,\u000d\u000a      with 450,000t milled for\u000d\u000a      human food consumption [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Impacts on commerce: \u000d\u000a      BEAA oat varieties based on our research activities [section 2] account\u000d\u000a      for approximately 65% of\u000d\u000a      the oats used in the UK and have a significant impact on the agriculture\u000d\u000a      sector. The instant market\u000d\u000a      for oats in the UK as of May 2013 is worth more than &#163;120 million, with\u000d\u000a      \"Oats So Simple\" alone\u000d\u000a      worth &#163;97.3 million [5.6] and is now the 3rd most valuable\u000d\u000a      cereal in the UK. Porridge sales are &#163;40\u000d\u000a      million putting the UK market for hot oat cereals at over &#163;160 million.\u000d\u000a      The BEAA oat varieties also\u000d\u000a      impact on other sectors: the ready to eat cereals, granolas and mueslis\u000d\u000a      market is approximately\u000d\u000a      worth &#163;19 million and bars and biscuits nearly &#163;10 million. Sales of\u000d\u000a      oat-based products are\u000d\u000a      increasing at 5% per annum. BEAA research thus contributes to the improved\u000d\u000a      human diet as a\u000d\u000a      consequence of the increasing popularity of oats in the retail market.\u000d\u000a      Economic impact is not only\u000d\u000a      in the UK as the UK is also a major exporter of oat products into Europe,\u000d\u000a      the Middle East, Africa\u000d\u000a      and Asia; 55% of the output of the QUAKER mill at Cupar is exported and\u000d\u000a      almost all as packed\u000d\u000a      retail products.\u000d\u000a    In the UK the majority of the oat crop comprises BEAA's winter oat\u000d\u000a      varieties; spring oats represent\u000d\u000a      ca. 25% of the crop. The Crop Evaluation Limited Recommended List (RL) of\u000d\u000a      winter oats is\u000d\u000a      currently dominated by BEAA varieties (eg 100% in 2012). The winter oat\u000d\u000a      variety Mascani, bred by\u000d\u000a      BEAA (RL listed in 2004), is currently the most widely grown, accounting\u000d\u000a      for nearly 50% of the\u000d\u000a      current winter oat seed sales [5.7] with 60,000ha of land sown for\u000d\u000a      production of this variety. Two\u000d\u000a      BEAA bred spring oat varieties (Glamis and Conway) are currently on the UK\u000d\u000a      National List and are\u000d\u000a      in RL trials. The oat crop is used for human food and also for animal\u000d\u000a      feed; the BEAA breeding\u000d\u000a      programme introduced the `naked oat' types in which the husks thresh free\u000d\u000a      from the groat during\u000d\u000a      harvesting, and these are favoured as feed for pigs and poultry. The BEAA\u000d\u000a      naked oat breeding\u000d\u000a      programme has bred varieties with high oil content and high ME value\u000d\u000a      making them a quality\u000d\u000a      animal feedstuff. Three (of 9) RL varieties of winter oats and one spring\u000d\u000a      oat (Lennon) listed in 2012\u000d\u000a      are naked oat varieties bred by BEAA [5.7], further emphasising the impact\u000d\u000a      of the BEAA breeding\u000d\u000a      programme on the diversification of the market for the oat crop. The\u000d\u000a      merits of these naked oat\u000d\u000a      varieties, marketed by Agrii [5.8] are listed in the UK RL guide 2012\/2013\u000d\u000a      [5.7]. Approximately\u000d\u000a      8500t were produced in 2012 with 18.8% going to the poultry sector, 14.1%\u000d\u000a      to pet food, 9.9% for\u000d\u000a      bird food, 16.4% for pigs and 40.8% for horses and malting.\u000d\u000a    Impact on production:\u000d\u000a      The BEAA research on dwarfing genes in oats has enabled the development of\u000d\u000a      dwarf varieties,\u000d\u000a      such as Balado, added to the UK RL in 2010, that reduce the risk of\u000d\u000a      lodging [5.9], and the need to\u000d\u000a      apply plant growth regulators to control plant height.

Oats are regarded as a healthy human food due to the\u000d\u000a      composition of the grain,\u000d\u000a      specifically the &#946;-glucan content. Analysis by Leggett of oil content\u000d\u000a      and composition [3.4] and beta-glucan\u000d\u000a      content [3.5] has underpinned the oat breeding programme for both sectors\u000d\u000a      and quantified\u000d\u000a      the variation in &#946;-glucan content within and between cultivated oats\u000d\u000a      and their wild relatives and so\u000d\u000a      released the potential for exploitation of wild relatives as a source of\u000d\u000a      novel genetic variation. More\u000d\u000a      recent research by Howarth (Aberystwyth, 1985-present) [3.6] on DArT\u000d\u000a      marker development has\u000d\u000a      enabled the breeding of varieties with high levels of &#946;-glucan.\u000d\u000a    Oats are regarded as a high value animal feed. Naked oats have a\u000d\u000a      non-lignified husk that is\u000d\u000a      removed during harvesting. Research by Ougham (Aberystwyth, 1983-2010)\u000d\u000a      [3.7] was carried out\u000d\u000a      on the contrasting reproductive development of naked and husked,\u000d\u000a      specifically lignin deposition.\u000d\u000a      Later research showed that the naked oat trait greatly increases the\u000d\u000a      metabolisable energy (ME) for\u000d\u000a      poultry, for which the husk is almost indigestible. Research by Cowan\u000d\u000a      (Aberystwyth, 1989-present)\u000d\u000a      [3.8] has since shown that oats are a high-energy grain suitable as a\u000d\u000a      monogastric feedstuff with a\u000d\u000a      well-balanced protein composition rich in essential amino acids. This\u000d\u000a      makes naked oats ideal for\u000d\u000a      inclusion in animal diets as an energy source and has underpinned the\u000d\u000a      breeding of naked oat\u000d\u000a      varieties and demonstrated their value as a high value feed for\u000d\u000a      monogastrics.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42091","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research has been twofold: firstly it has influenced\u000d\u000a      major planning decisions and also environmental policy decisions.\u000d\u000a      Secondly, it has established that fungi, along with other microbes should\u000d\u000a      be considered in conservation planning and conservation practice, a\u000d\u000a      process that has involved the raising of public awareness that fungi\u000d\u000a      deliver important ecosystem services and that they can be threatened by\u000d\u000a      human activities.\u000d\u000a    As noted above, semi-natural grasslands are amongst the most threatened\u000d\u000a      habitats in Europe. In the UK many such sites are legally protected\u000d\u000a      following notification as SSSIs. It is only very recently that distinctive\u000d\u000a      fungal populations have factored in the notification of any SSSIs and in\u000d\u000a      this respect the UK leads the world in recognising that sites with\u000d\u000a      distinctive fungal populations merit legal protection. For two of the four\u000d\u000a      such SSSIs in the UK , there has been significant input from G. W.\u000d\u000a      Griffith, as follows:\u000d\u000a    The notification of Eithinog (Bangor, Gwynedd) as an SSSI was based on an\u000d\u000a      assessment of the fungal diversity by BEAA. Following plans by the site\u000d\u000a      owner (Gwynedd Council) to undertake a building development at the site\u000d\u000a      and resultant objections, G. W. Griffith was commissioned by CCW to\u000d\u000a      undertake an assessment of the mycological value of the sites [5.1]. Based\u000d\u000a      on his report, CCW decided to notify the site as SSSI in 2008 [5.2], with\u000d\u000a      a press release from CCW stating \"An in-depth assessment by Aberystwyth\u000d\u000a      University commissioned by the Countryside Council for Wales, revealed the\u000d\u000a      development would not affect the site's important fungi, provided\u000d\u000a      appropriate measures were put in place to protect the new SSSI during the\u000d\u000a      work\". This notification was accompanied by several newspaper reports\u000d\u000a      [5.3] and the site has since been sold to the North Wales Wildlife Trust\u000d\u000a      and established as a nature reserve for the local community.\u000d\u000a    A similar proposed housing development of Llanishen Reservoir (Cardiff)\u000d\u000a      also led to the notification as an SSSI based on its diverse populations\u000d\u000a      of grassland fungi (on the embankment areas). The notification was based\u000d\u000a      on work by G. W. Griffith that discovered 28 species of waxcap on the site\u000d\u000a      and his assessment that this site was of international importance for\u000d\u000a      these fungi. This notification was upheld following judicial review at the\u000d\u000a      Royal Courts of Justice and subsequent challenges to the notification by\u000d\u000a      the site owners between 2009 and 2013. The fate of the reservoir and the\u000d\u000a      legal challenges generated considerable press attention and were discussed\u000d\u000a      in the House of Commons (Hansard, 25th Feb and 6th\u000d\u000a      July 2010) [5.4]. The development plans were ultimately quashed by the\u000d\u000a      Welsh Assembly Government (24th April 2013) [5.5]. This legal\u000d\u000a      saga [3.1], is described in a recent legal textbook with specific\u000d\u000a      reference to data generated by G. W. Griffith (Rodgers, 2013; [5.6]).\u000d\u000a    In light of these SSSI notifications, JNCC (Joint Nature Conservation\u000d\u000a      Committee; statutory adviser to the UK Government on national and\u000d\u000a      international nature conservation and part of DEFRA) undertook a review of\u000d\u000a      guidelines relating to the selection of biological SSSI's and specifically\u000d\u000a      grassland fungi [5.7]. These new guidelines relied heavily on BEAA\u000d\u000a      research findings and informal advice from G. W. Griffith. These\u000d\u000a      publications and other advice have also been widely used to inform\u000d\u000a      prioritisation of sites important for conservation, for example in UK\u000d\u000a      Local Biodiversity Action Plans [5.8].\u000d\u000a    The fundamental research at BEAA has been accompanied by activities to\u000d\u000a      raise public awareness of the conservation importance of fungi (and other\u000d\u000a      microbes).

Studies in mainland Europe had highlighted\u000d\u000a      the consequence of huge losses in lowland grassland habitats (estimated to\u000d\u000a      be &gt;95% since 1945) on the biodiversity of grassland macrofungi. This\u000d\u000a      was most serious in the Netherlands where it is estimated that only 200 ha\u000d\u000a      of `waxcap grassland' habitat remain [3.1]. Work at BEAA since 2001, led\u000d\u000a      by Gareth Wyn Griffith, has developed and enhanced this area of biology,\u000d\u000a      making a major contribution to the understanding of the diversity and\u000d\u000a      ecology of fungi in grassland ecosystems [3.1,3.2]. This includes the\u000d\u000a      fungal inhabitants of herbivore digestive tracts (e.g. discovery of two\u000d\u000a      new genera of anaerobic fungi) and plant roots (dark septate endophytes;\u000d\u000a      discovery of the importance of these fungi in mesotrophic grasslands) but\u000d\u000a      the greatest impact has emerged from our work on grassland macrofungi of\u000d\u000a      conservation importance.\u000d\u000a    Underpinning these studies of fungal diversity in grassland systems has\u000d\u000a      been the contribution of several past and present members of BEAA staff\u000d\u000a      (G. W. Griffith, D. R. Davies [until 2010], B. Douglas, J. Edwards, J.\u000d\u000a      Ironside) to landmark publications in fungal phylogenetics [3.3], which\u000d\u000a      have led in turn to taxonomic revisions [3.4] and ultimately the\u000d\u000a      establishment of an agreed fungal DNA barcode [3.5]. Such developments\u000d\u000a      have been crucial to the development of a stable nomenclature for fungi\u000d\u000a      and in development for genetic methods for the detection and\u000d\u000a      identification of fungi.\u000d\u000a    This impact in protecting the more vulnerable populations of grassland\u000d\u000a      macrofungi has been achieved from underpinning research at AU funded by\u000d\u000a      diverse stakeholders (e.g. NERC [3.6], DEFRA, Plantlife, Grasslands' Trust\u000d\u000a      and UK statutory conservation bodies, such as the Countryside Council for\u000d\u000a      Wales (CCW) and equivalent bodies in Scotland, England and Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland. These have permitted the development of quantitative survey\u000d\u000a      methodologies [3.1] that allow objective assessment of fungal diversity\u000d\u000a      and, thus, identification of sites in need of protection. Investigation of\u000d\u000a      the basic ecology of these fungi has led to the development of specific\u000d\u000a      management recommendations (in particular appropriate grazing management\u000d\u000a      and avoidance of eutrophication) based on robust experimental data [3.2].\u000d\u000a      These results are of direct relevance to conservation-orientated land\u000d\u000a      managers (e.g. nature reserve wardens) and also to policymakers (e.g. in\u000d\u000a      the design of agri-environment schemes or assessment of sites warranting\u000d\u000a      statutory legal protection). This research has also raised the public\u000d\u000a      profile of microbial conservation [3.7].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43294","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Building on scientific studies published from 2002 onwards, the direct\u000d\u000a      impact of arsenic and rice\u000d\u000a      investigations within the assessment period (2008-2013) were based on\u000d\u000a      human health impacts,\u000d\u000a      resulting in action by regulators, legislators, consumers and the food\u000d\u000a      industry.\u000d\u000a    The first assessment period impact was when focus turned to rice products\u000d\u000a      and it was\u000d\u000a      hypothesised that baby rice and rice milk might be problematic, resulting\u000d\u000a      in the first papers in this\u000d\u000a      area [5 &amp; 6 above], which were critical of the lack of legislation\u000d\u000a      regarding arsenic in foods. As a\u000d\u000a      result of these studies, and those that the FSA had commissioned itself,\u000d\u000a      the FSA advised in May\u000d\u000a      2009 the following: `As a precaution, toddlers and young children\u000d\u000a        between 1 and 4.5 years old\u000d\u000a        should not have rice drinks as a replacement for cows' milk, breast\u000d\u000a        milk, or infant formula. This is\u000d\u000a        because they will then drink a relatively large amount of it, and their\u000d\u000a        intake of arsenic will be\u000d\u000a        greater than that of older children and adults relative to their\u000d\u000a        bodyweight. This is both on nutritional\u000d\u000a        grounds and because such substitution can increase their intake of\u000d\u000a        inorganic arsenic, which should\u000d\u000a        be kept as low as possible. A daily half pint or 280 millilitres of rice\u000d\u000a        drink could double the amount\u000d\u000a        of the more harmful form of arsenic they consume each day\" [a]. Thus\u000d\u000a      the FSA directly acted on\u000d\u000a      the findings and advice of the Aberdeen University rice milk paper.\u000d\u000a    The Aberdeen studies on arsenic in rice culminating in the baby rice and\u000d\u000a      baby milk surveys also\u000d\u000a      prompted a major reassessment in 2009 of inorganic arsenic exposure of the\u000d\u000a      EU populace by the\u000d\u000a      EFSA [c]. This review by an assembled expert panel reached the same\u000d\u000a      conclusion as had the\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen studies on both rice milk and baby rice. Another major conclusion\u000d\u000a      from this EFSA\u000d\u000a      review was that the World Health Organization's inorganic arsenic\u000d\u000a      Provisional Maximum Tolerable\u000d\u000a      Daily Intake (PMTDI) was based on flawed calculations, was thus too high,\u000d\u000a      and was not\u000d\u000a      scientifically sustainable. The Aberdeen group had initiated this debate\u000d\u000a      through its series of\u000d\u000a      papers on rice, and indeed was the first and most vocal critic of this\u000d\u000a      PMTDI with respect to food\u000d\u000a      intakes. As the WHO PMTDI represented the only international benchmark of\u000d\u000a      inorganic arsenic\u000d\u000a      intake in any ingested item, it had been widely used to justify that\u000d\u000a      inorganic arsenic intakes from\u000d\u000a      rice were `safe'. This was a highly flawed argument that did not stand\u000d\u000a      scientific scrutiny, as rice is\u000d\u000a      the dominant source of inorganic arsenic globally, not water. While both\u000d\u000a      the WHO and EU have\u000d\u000a      set strict and low levels of what is the maximum allowed inorganic arsenic\u000d\u000a      in drinking water, given\u000d\u000a      that there are regions of the world that suffer from naturally elevated\u000d\u000a      arsenic in drinking waters,\u000d\u000a      they have not set food standards for inorganic arsenic.

(2002)\u000d\u000a      [1]. These identified that\u000d\u000a      the irrigation of paddy rice with groundwater containing high levels of\u000d\u000a      arsenic in Bangladesh and\u000d\u000a      West Bengal, India, might be of concern, placing earlier physiological\u000d\u000a      studies on arsenic\u000d\u000a      assimilation by rice in context. This was shortly followed by the first\u000d\u000a      field survey of arsenic in rice\u000d\u000a      grain to be published anywhere, identifying that indeed there was\u000d\u000a      extensive arsenic contamination\u000d\u000a      of rice, and paddy soil, in Bangladesh [2]. Furthermore, this publication\u000d\u000a      was the first to question\u000d\u000a      the failure of international bodies to set clear arsenic standards, and,\u000d\u000a      more specifically, the failure\u000d\u000a      to account for and legislate against arsenic in foodstuffs.\u000d\u000a    These initial findings provided impetus for further study, resulting in\u000d\u000a      the first paper to consider\u000d\u000a      arsenic in rice in a global context. This study revealed that EU, USA and\u000d\u000a      Bangladeshi arsenic\u000d\u000a      levels in rice were elevated above \"natural\" levels, and was the first to\u000d\u000a      identify that arsenic\u000d\u000a      speciation (the identification of the chemical forms of arsenic present)\u000d\u000a      in rice varied between\u000d\u000a      different rice producing regions [3]). The findings for Bangladesh were\u000d\u000a      further clarified by detailed\u000d\u000a      rice grain surveys, culminating in the most detailed global assessment of\u000d\u000a      total and inorganic\u000d\u000a      arsenic content of rice grain to date [4]. This enabled cancer risks from\u000d\u000a      arsenic-contaminated rice\u000d\u000a      to be estimated on a regional basis, showing that there is an elevated\u000d\u000a      risk of bladder and lung\u000d\u000a      cancers from rice based on the most up to date US EPA modelling of\u000d\u000a      inorganic arsenic cancer\u000d\u000a      risks. Those risks are highest for countries such as Bangladesh that have\u000d\u000a      very high rice\u000d\u000a      consumption rates combined with highly arsenic-contaminated rice.\u000d\u000a    The realisation that rice consumption represented a major source of\u000d\u000a      inorganic arsenic exposure led\u000d\u000a      to the investigation of specific rice-based food products. This phase of\u000d\u000a      arsenic in rice studies\u000d\u000a      identified that inorganic arsenic in baby rice [5] and rice milk [6] were\u000d\u000a      of considerable concern.\u000d\u000a      These two papers led directly to the 2009 EFSA review of arsenic from\u000d\u000a      foodstuffs [c] and the UK\u000d\u000a      FSA report, also in 2009, advising that rice milk should not be given to\u000d\u000a      children under 4 years old\u000d\u000a      [a]. Highest inorganic arsenic levels were identified in stabilized\u000d\u000a      rice bran products [7].

Smith was approached by Unilever, acting on behalf of a\u000d\u000a      number of global agri-food companies in 2009, to develop the science\u000d\u000a      described above into a practical software tool that could be used across\u000d\u000a      the world in a variety of food supply chains to help the companies meet\u000d\u000a      their ambitions to significantly reduce GHG emissions from agriculture\u000d\u000a      [c]. The first version of the tool was delivered in 2010, and has since\u000d\u000a      been used in 16 farming systems, in 18 countries sponsored by 18 agri-food\u000d\u000a      companies and NGOs (e.g. [c, d, e, g, h, I, j]). Some of the largest\u000d\u000a      agri-food companies (e.g. Unilever, PepsiCo, Tesco, Heinz, Sysco, and\u000d\u000a      Costco) sponsor this work, representing a significant proportion of global\u000d\u000a      agricultural food chains. A number of these companies have ambitious\u000d\u000a      emission reduction targets (e.g. PepsiCo aims to reduce emissions by 50%\u000d\u000a      in 5 years); these companies are now reducing GHG emissions by engaging\u000d\u000a      their producers in measures to reduce emissions, facilitated by the Cool\u000d\u000a      Farm Tool as described by the companies themselves in a number of case\u000d\u000a      studies (http:\/\/www.coolfarmtool.org\/CaseStudies).\u000d\u000a    Contribution by the University of Aberdeen: The work described\u000d\u000a      above, culminating in the IPCC chapter, was underpinned by a sustained\u000d\u000a      body of research in Smith's team. The IPCC chapter is necessarily\u000d\u000a      co-authored from experts around the world, but Smith led the team that\u000d\u000a      conducted the assessment, and was lead author of the chapter and\u000d\u000a      underpinning papers (see section 2). The development of the software tool\u000d\u000a      was in collaboration with Unilever and the industry-funded Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Food Lab; Hillier and Smith led the scientific and technical aspects of\u000d\u000a      the development.\u000d\u000a    There are three levels of beneficiary: (1) policy makers who have\u000d\u000a      benefited from the science arising from the research to allow them to\u000d\u000a      design policy based on quantifiable outcomes and costs, (2) agri-food\u000d\u000a      businesses and farmers who, through the Cool Farm Tool, have access to\u000d\u000a      tools to help them reduce the environmental impact of their farming\u000d\u000a      operations, (3) society, which benefits from reduced climate change due to\u000d\u000a      reduced GHG emissions (which account for ~25% of human GHG emissions).\u000d\u000a    Claimed impact as defined by REF guidance:\u000d\u000a    Evidence of the extent of the impact described: 18 companies are\u000d\u000a      sponsoring the Cool Farm Institute which was set up to maximise global\u000d\u000a      access and use of the Cool Farm Tool to assess GHG emissions and devise\u000d\u000a      roadmaps for GHG emission reduction. The work is having real impact e.g.\u000d\u000a      the PepsiCo \"50 in 5\" target was introduced in 2010 and the Cool Farm Tool\u000d\u000a      is one of two tools supporting this programme. Emissions have been reduced\u000d\u000a      as a result. Progress toward its \"50 in 5\" targets is published in\u000d\u000a      PepsiCo's yearly sustainability updates, which are published and\u000d\u000a      independently assured by Deloitte LLP. Other examples include Unilever\u000d\u000a      which has embedded the Cool Farm Tool into its farmer and supplier\u000d\u000a      sustainable agriculture self-assessment platform, H.J. Heinz which chose\u000d\u000a      to focus on a key crop and a major growing region &#8212; California tomatoes\u000d\u000a      -where they source from approximately 270,000 acres annually, and Oxfam GB\u000d\u000a      which has used the Cool Farm Tool to examine the\u000d\u000a      effects of climate change on smallholder farmers in Guatemala producing\u000d\u000a      frozen vegetables for export. These and other case studies are described\u000d\u000a      at http:\/\/www.coolfarmtool.org\/CaseStudies.\u000d\u000a      Impacts on the environment have already been significant through\u000d\u000a      quantified emission reductions on trial farms, and through engagement in\u000d\u000a      GHG emission reduction of previously unaware producers and farmers\u000d\u000a      supplying the global food companies listed, leading to a reduced\u000d\u000a        climate impact of farming for growers and suppliers.\u000d\u000a    Dates when impacts occurred: Society will ultimately benefit from\u000d\u000a      reduced GHG emissions from agriculture, but the benefits may not be felt\u000d\u000a      for some time since emission reduction has long-term, rather than\u000d\u000a      short-term, effects. In the meantime, many other beneficiaries have\u000d\u000a      already benefited from the impact described here. Policy makers and\u000d\u000a      shapers have already benefited from the science provided on GHG mitigation\u000d\u000a      potential in agriculture (e.g. UNFCCC 2008 position paper for climate\u000d\u000a      negotiations: [a]) leading to impact on public policy, whereby guidelines\u000a        have been informed by this research evidence. Similarly, agri-food\u000d\u000a      companies and farmers have already benefited through use of the Cool Farm\u000d\u000a      Tool to help reduce GHG emissions in their food supply chains which has\u000d\u000a      driven impacts on the environment through changed management\u000d\u000a        of the environmental risk presented by GHG emissions and impacts\u000d\u000a        on commerce by allowing agri-food companies to improve their\u000d\u000a        performance (both environmental and economic) by reducing inputs\u000d\u000a      [c].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Climate change, and the need to feed 9-10 billion people by 2050, are two\u000d\u000a      of the greatest challenges facing humanity this century. Agriculture needs\u000d\u000a      to provide more food from less input, and with agriculture contributing\u000d\u000a      around a quarter of human greenhouse gas emissions, it needs to do so\u000d\u000a      while reducing its impact on the climate.

Smith (Professor; 2013- present);\u000d\u000a      Hillier (Independent Research Fellow and main developer of the Cool Farm\u000d\u000a      Tool; 2005- present); plus 30+ PDRAs over the 10-year period.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43296","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Scottish Government's decision to publish the University of\u000a      Aberdeen's windfarm carbon calculator online in 2008 [a] attracted\u000a      immediate attention from the national media, and transformed the\u000a      politically sensitive debate over the development of windfarms on Scottish\u000a      peatlands. Carbon calculations are now an integral part of the planning\u000a      process, having progressed rapidly from a point where carbon\u000a      considerations did not factor in the conversation, even though the impetus\u000a      for windfarm construction is powered by global pledges to reduce\u000a      emissions.\u000a    The development of the calculator has involved years of in-depth\u000a      negotiations between the Aberdeen academics and regulatory bodies\u000a      (Scottish Executive, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish\u000a      National Heritage), NGOs (RSPB, John Muir Trust, National Trust) and\u000a      industry (Scottish Renewables, Scottish Power, Forestry Commission) to\u000a      ensure the tool is accepted by all. There are five key beneficiaries;\u000a      Smith has communicated with all main parties through regular meetings. The\u000a      windfarm industry has a tool that helps it demonstrate the environmental\u000a      credibility of a proposed site and speeds up the planning process,\u000a      evidenced by the successful application for Freasdail Windfarm in 2012\u000a      [f]. Community groups and NGOs have free access to a transparent\u000a      methodology that allows cases to be made against unsuitable developments.\u000a      Planning authorities can quickly check the carbon payback time of a\u000a      planned development. Wider society, which recognises the urgent need to\u000a      reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels, has a tool that\u000a      ensures the envisaged benefits of windfarms are achieved. The Scottish\u000a      Government has been able to claim on its website that it is \"a world\u000a      leader in advancing new scientific research on the carbon impact of wind\u000a      farms on peatlands, as part of our wider drive to promote best practice\u000a      for energy developments\" [j].\u000a    The controversial 103-turbine wind farm in Shetland - the third biggest\u000a      in Scotland - received government approval in April 2012. The calculator\u000a      informed three years of wrangling between developers Viking Energy [b] and\u000a      community groups like Sustainable Shetland [c] opposed to the plans.\u000a      Following carbon calculations, in September 2011 Viking agreed to scale\u000a      back its proposals, reducing the number of turbines from 150 to 127. But\u000a      Ministers went further and granted consent for only 103 turbines, which\u000a      still provided an estimated &#163;30m in annual income for the local community,\u000a      according to BBC news. The case encouraged the Scottish Government to fund\u000a      amendments to the windfarm carbon calculator and energy minister Fergus\u000a      Ewing launched a revised model in June 2011. He issued a requirement that\u000a      all new windfarm Section 36 planning applications must use the calculator\u000a      \"for assessing carbon losses and savings\" in developments that generate\u000a      50MW of electricity or more [d]. Ewing said: \"Planning authorities, like\u000a      all public bodies, have a duty to take account of the emission effects of\u000a      their decision-making, and they should encourage developers to use the\u000a      carbon assessment tool for all wind farms on peat as a matter of good\u000a      practice\" [g]. The Government is considering an extension of the\u000a      regulations to smaller sites.\u000a    The long-term environmental impact of the decision is clear: developments\u000a      on sensitive peatlands are avoided and sensitive habitats protected.\u000a      Furthermore the carbon calculator has opened up opportunities for land\u000a      restoration. Calculation of the impacts of different management strategies\u000a      of windfarm sites encourages developers to use their financial resources\u000a      to instigate peatland restoration and good practice to achieve a reduced\u000a      carbon payback time. If developments are focused on disturbed sites, extra\u000a      resources available for restoration from the industry can have a positive\u000a      impact on these habitats. But Aberdeen's research also provides a\u000a      scientific basis on which decisions can be made; it has contributed\u000a      rationale to debates where preconceived ideologies often cloud judgement.\u000a      The carbon calculator encourages developments on peatlands that are not\u000a      sensitive. For example, Black Law windfarm in Lanarkshire is sited on an\u000a      area previously used for mining so the damage resulting from the\u000a      development is much reduced. Aberdeen's research was cited in a Sunday\u000a      Herald article [e] in July 2008 to support criticism of a call by Scottish\u000a      Conservative MEP, Struan Stevenson, to ban wind farms from all peatlands.\u000a      His opponents, including Scottish Renewables, accused Stevenson of `bad\u000a      science', quoting Smith's published paper and referencing the carbon\u000a      calculator.\u000a    Further research published in Nature by Smith has shifted the\u000a      public debate further [6]. Based on new calculations the academics assert\u000a      that all developments on pristine peatlands should be avoided [h]. The\u000a      recommendation was made in a letter to Nature and covered by the Daily\u000a        Mail and The Press and Journal. The John Muir Trust has used\u000a      this to support its lobbying for a Wild Land Designation in Scotland. The\u000a      Scottish Government is considering the allocation of further funding to\u000a      Aberdeen to explore how the calculator can be adapted to assess wider use\u000a      of peatlands.\u000a    Claimed impact as defined by REF therefore is that: the Aberdeen work\u000a        has had an impact on public policy and services by stimulating public\u000a        debate, through changes to regulations and through implementation of new\u000a        technology, the Carbon Calculator. It has impacted practitioners and\u000a        services that have used the research findings in conducting their work.\u000a        Further, it has had an impact on the environment by planning decisions\u000a        being informed by the work.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Scottish Government is aiming to generate all of its electricity\u000a      through renewable energy sources by 2020.

Windfarms situated on peatlands, usually located on\u000a      exposed sites and less productive than managed mineral soils, offer high\u000a      energy returns and reduced investment costs. However, one hectare of\u000a      peatland can contain 5,000 tonnes of carbon (http:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/dn9722-grouseshooting-popularity-boosts-global-warming.html).\u000a      Installation of wind turbines can rapidly decompose peat, releasing carbon\u000a      into the atmosphere, thus lengthening the time for carbon payback and\u000a      destroying sensitive wildlife habitats.\u000a    Research at the University of Aberdeen led by Jo Smith, Professor in Soil\u000a      Organic Matter and Nutrient Modelling, coincided with an increase in the\u000a      mid-2000s in plans to develop windfarms on peatlands without considering\u000a      the carbon emissions cost. The importance of soil carbon to total\u000a      greenhouse gas emissions was highlighted in a seminal paper lead by\u000a      Aberdeen researchers in 2005, on emissions of greenhouse gases from\u000a      European soils, one of the first to provide dynamic simulations of changes\u000a      in soil carbon across Europe [1]. Carbon losses from organic soils were\u000a      identified as a key uncertainty because these soils hold large amounts of\u000a      carbon and so, if poorly managed, have potential to emit large quantities\u000a      of greenhouse gases. The findings inspired a &#163;500,000 grant [7] from the\u000a      Scottish Executive (SERAD) to develop a new model ECOSSE (Estimating\u000a      Carbon in Organic Soils - Sequestration and Emissions) to quantify\u000a      greenhouse gas emissions from organic soils.\u000a    Simulations using ECOSSE [2,3] revealed the scale of the potential threat\u000a      to Scottish peatlands and high potential carbon emissions that could\u000a      result from widespread conversion of Scottish peatlands. The data revised\u000a      estimates for carbon stored in organic soils in Scotland and Wales upwards\u000a      by 30 per cent for Scotland and 20 per cent for Wales. Recognising an\u000a      urgent need to factor potential greenhouse gas emissions into planning\u000a      applications for windfarms, the Scottish Government provided further\u000a      funding [8] for Aberdeen to design a simplified model that\u000a      could be used to calculate emissions at each proposed site.\u000a    Led by Jo Smith, University of Aberdeen researchers and their partners\u000a      created a carbon calculator for estimating potential carbon emission\u000a      savings that can be achieved if windfarms are developed on peatland or\u000a      forested land [4-6]. The methodology estimated the carbon payback time for\u000a      the windfarm; the time required for net carbon losses associated with the\u000a      windfarm to be balanced by carbon savings through clean energy. Net carbon\u000a      losses include loss of carbon from infrastructure; from carbon stored in\u000a      peat and forest; loss of carbon-fixing potential of peatland and forest;\u000a      and carbon savings due to habitat improvement. The calculator, published\u000a      in 2008, enabled planners to avoid developments on sensitive sites, while\u000a      permitting developments with good management on sites where a windfarm\u000a      does not result in degradation of sensitive soils. Developments to the\u000a      calculator continue - the latest version was released in 2011 - and will\u000a      improve its user friendliness and take into account further extraneous\u000a      factors like the impact of sheep grazing, housing and road construction.\u000a      Other lead Aberdeen academics were Dr Dali Nayak, Research Fellow\u000a      (2007-present), and Pete Smith, Professor of Soils &amp; Global Change\u000a      (2001-present).

The work examined the effect of the buffer in both simulated fore\u000a      gut and hind gut conditions and found the supplement to be an effective\u000a      buffer and stimulant for hind gut fermentation. Marketing of the product\u000a      has been based on these findings.

The Hale et al., (2012) study was the\u000a      first to address aetiological factors relating to the hind gut microbiome\u000a      of laminitic versus control animals. High fibre and high starch feed\u000a      substrates were incubated with faecal inocula from a group of ponies with\u000a      a history of laminitis (n=8), and a group of disease free control animals\u000a      (n=8). The extent and rate of degradation of substrate was measured over a\u000a      96 hour period using a standard gas production technique. The laminitic\u000a      ponies demonstrated significant fibre digestion deficiencies, which\u000a      highlighted the need for feed supplements that promote cellulolytic\u000a      degradation.

The Hale et\u000a        al., (2011) work reported herein sought to address this long held\u000a      belief experimentally. In a randomised cross over design, horses (n=8)\u000a      were fed both a high fibre and a high starch ration, before measurements\u000a      of behavioural reactivity and heart rate were performed. A significant\u000a      increase in both behavioural reactivity scores and heart rate associated\u000a      with the high starch treatment indicates that starch contributes to\u000a      behaviours that detract from manageability.

Key strategies have been\u000d\u000a      identified and researched to tackle this problem, e.g. reduction in the\u000d\u000a      prevalence of early maturing fish prior to harvest either using\u000d\u000a      photoperiodic treatment or sterility using chromosome manipulation, a\u000d\u000a      technique unique to aquatic fish and shellfish among farmed animals. The\u000d\u000a      knowledge gained by the group in these areas has led to the implementation\u000d\u000a      of protocols, guidelines and practices within the industry that have\u000d\u000a      significantly improved the sustainability of the sector, generating growth\u000d\u000a      and increased profitability.\u000d\u000a    Optimised photoperiod regimes developed by the reproduction group in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with leading light manufacturers (BGB Engineering, Akva and\u000d\u000a      recently Philips Lighting) have led to a considerable reduction in the\u000d\u000a      prevalence of early maturation during the first year of salmon on growing\u000d\u000a      at sea from &gt;40% in the late 1990`s to &lt;3% (from 2008 onwards) and\u000d\u000a      reduced energy usage through a combination of timing and duration of the\u000d\u000a      light exposure window as well as the adoption of new lighting technologies\u000d\u000a      and standardised light intensity. This has been implemented globally by\u000d\u000a      the salmon farming industry with companies that operate in all salmon\u000d\u000a      production countries (Marine Harvest, Scottish Seafarms) through knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer activities (workshop, consultancies, training) and contributed\u000d\u000a      very significantly to reduce costs and improve fish welfare. This\u000d\u000a      knowledge base has subsequently helped us pioneer similar light regimes\u000d\u000a      for Atlantic cod incorporating the use of specialist surface nets to shade\u000d\u000a      ambient sunlight, these were implemented commercially in Scotland and\u000d\u000a      Norway. However, such light regimes do not address the potential\u000d\u000a      environmental concerns associated with salmon escapees interacting with\u000d\u000a      wild salmonid stocks (in Scotland alone, 1.9 million farmed salmon escaped\u000d\u000a      into the natural environment between 2002 and 2009 due to human error,\u000d\u000a      storm damage or holes in nets). Therefore, there is an increasing pressure\u000d\u000a      from retailers, fish welfare standards and accreditation bodies, NGOs and\u000d\u000a      governments towards the development and implementation of sterile stocks.\u000d\u000a      While other strategies delay or limit the prevalence of early maturation\u000d\u000a      in culture, sterility fully suppresses puberty in females and by doing so\u000d\u000a      removes any introgression concerns for wild stocks in the event of\u000d\u000a      escapees.\u000d\u000a    Work done by the reproduction group is at the forefront of the research\u000d\u000a      on sterility through chromosome manipulation (induced triploidy) since\u000d\u000a      2008. A suite of projects (Salmotrip, 2008-11, BBSRC, 2011-15 and\u000d\u000a      Salmotrip+, 2013-16) coordinated by Prof. Migaud in collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      world leaders in salmon production, breeding and genetic enhancement\u000d\u000a      (Marine Harvest, Aquagen, and Hendrix Genetics) investigated the\u000d\u000a      commercial feasibility of producing sterile salmon with a focus on\u000d\u000a      breeding and selection, fish performances, nutritional requirements, fish\u000d\u000a      welfare and deformity, and consumer perception towards such a new product.\u000d\u000a      Research performed by the group on triploid salmon led to the first\u000d\u000a      introduction of triploid salmon on the market in 2012 by Aquagen and the\u000d\u000a      first commercial scale farming in Norway (2.5 million triploid salmon eggs\u000d\u000a      produced in 2012) and Scotland (forecast of 1 million triploid eggs\u000d\u000a      produced in November 2013). Research on nutritional requirements of\u000d\u000a      triploid salmon (2010-13) led to the development of triploid diets that\u000d\u000a      reduce skeletal deformities by as much as 50% and completely abolished\u000d\u000a      cataract prevalence (patent pending). These dietary formulations are now\u000d\u000a      being commercially produced by one of the largest feed manufacturer in\u000d\u000a      aquaculture (Biomar) and supplied to farms on growing triploid salmon in\u000d\u000a      UK, Norway and Tasmania. Knowledge transfer activities performed by the\u000d\u000a      group since 2008 had a very significant impact, not only on the fish\u000d\u000a      farming sector (producers, breeders, processors) but also on retailers,\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations (NASCO), governmental bodies and the\u000d\u000a      general public at national and international levels. Project results have\u000d\u000a      been disseminated widely through workshops organised during the European\u000d\u000a      Aquaculture Society meetings in 2010 and 2011, trade journal articles and\u000d\u000a      scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals. Importantly, data generated\u000d\u000a      is playing an important role in legislative decision-making regarding\u000d\u000a      future aquaculture policies and the use of triploidy within the salmonid\u000d\u000a      industries (rainbow and brown trout also) and fisheries. A demonstration\u000d\u000a      of this is the introduction by the Norwegian coastal and fisheries\u000d\u000a      ministry of `green licences' for salmon farming where green standards must\u000d\u000a      be met through technological and operational solutions to reduce\u000d\u000a      environmental challenge including a substantial reduction in the negative\u000d\u000a      impact of escapes on wild stocks through genetic (i.e. triploidy) and\u000d\u000a      physical containment. Also, the UK Environment Agency (EA) has introduced\u000d\u000a      new legislation to protect wild brown trout in England and Wales and by\u000d\u000a      2015 all trout stocked into all but totally enclosed waters with no\u000d\u000a      significant natural brown trout populations will be with sterile\u000d\u000a      all-female brown trout. This was made possible by research done in the\u000d\u000a      group which standardised triploidy induction technique and develop\u000d\u000a      monitoring tools for confirmation of triploidy status.\u000d\u000a    The impact of our research into the control of puberty in farmed fish, as\u000d\u000a      demonstrated above in salmon, cannot be underestimated as it is a key\u000d\u000a      milestone in the expansion of a sustainable aquaculture industry in\u000d\u000a      Scotland and worldwide.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Salmon maturation prior to harvest constitutes an environmental, welfare\u000d\u000a      and production bottleneck for the salmon aquaculture industry. Our\u000d\u000a      research has reduced the number of fish that mature during the grow-out\u000d\u000a      phase so they do not reallocate energy to develop gonads and display\u000d\u000a      secondary sexual characteristics that reduce yield, harvest quality and\u000d\u000a      increase disease susceptibility that can result in downgrading at\u000d\u000a      processing and lost profitability. In addition, reproductively competent\u000d\u000a      fish that escape from on-growing cages may breed with wild stocks, leading\u000d\u000a      to potential introgression. This has a major impact on public perception\u000d\u000a      of farmed salmon and it limits the expansion of the industry. The IoA\u000d\u000a      Reproduction team has undertaken a comprehensive body of work since 1993\u000d\u000a      to address this critical production bottleneck through an array of\u000d\u000a      management strategies.

With the radical change of scale\u000d\u000a      in production came the necessity to standardise\/optimise rearing protocols\u000d\u000a      to ensure reliable, year round, consistent supply of quality fish to a\u000d\u000a      growing market and minimise welfare and environmental impacts. To achieve\u000d\u000a      this it is critical that the industry controls the sexual maturation of\u000d\u000a      its fish in the production phase. Sexually maturing fish will result in\u000d\u000a      losses of growth, increased agonistic behaviour and disease\u000d\u000a      susceptibility, which are major welfare issues and product downgrading\u000d\u000a      because of reduced flesh quality and secondary sexual attributes. In\u000d\u000a      addition, farming of reproductively competent stock can have detrimental\u000d\u000a      effects on the fitness of wild stocks if they escape and interbreed. This\u000d\u000a      is negatively perceived by consumers and wild fisheries managers.

This work has resulted in farmed\u000a      salmon now being potential net producers of marine protein and oil\u000a      (2010-11). This is a highly successful outcome given the previous\u000a      situation of salmon farming as the world's biggest consumer of fishmeal\u000a      and fish oil.\u000a    Underpinning studies investigated the effects of various fish oil\u000a      substitutes and blends, and the levels, duration and timing of\u000a      substitution, in trials encompassing the entire growth cycle of salmon\u000a      from first-feeding fry to market size (1998-2005). The knowledge generated\u000a      informed industry on best practices for the substitution of fish oil with\u000a      vegetable oil in aquafeeds, and directly influenced commercial salmon feed\u000a      formulations that now show levels of fish oil substitution of between 25\u000a      and 70%, mainly with rapeseed oil. Different formulations and feeding\u000a      strategies were devised for minimising negative effects on tissue omega-3\u000a      LC-PUFA compositions including partial replacement of fish oil over the\u000a      entire growth cycle, or complete replacement followed by a pre-harvest\u000a      `finishing' phase using feeds with fish oil to restore omega-3 LC-PUFA\u000a      levels.\u000a    The major impact of this work is that these strategies are now employed\u000a      by the industry with the majority of production utilising partial\u000a      replacement with oil blends, and the finishing feed strategy being\u000a      employed to ensure that products comply with the high specifications of\u000a      premium retailers and quality certification. Recently, it was demonstrated\u000a      that feed formulations have enabled farmed salmon to be net producers,\u000a      rather than consumers, of marine protein and oil (Crampton et al., 2010;\u000a      Bendiksen et al., 2011). The impact of our research into the substitution\u000a      of fish oil in aquafeeds cannot be underestimated as the global supply of\u000a      fish oil would have been exceeded several years ago if substitution of\u000a      fish oil, particularly in salmonid feeds, had not been researched and\u000a      successfully implemented. Our contribution has not simply been to ensure\u000a      the continued expansion of aquaculture in a more sustainable manner, but\u000a      has specifically focussed on ensuring that the nutritional quality of the\u000a      product was not compromised. Omega-3 LC-PUFA levels are critically low in\u000a      Western diets and we cannot afford to allow levels in fish, the primary\u000a      source of these essential nutrients in our diet, to decline significantly.\u000a    The applied research was supported by fundamental studies including the\u000a      application of molecular and genomic technologies such as transcriptomics\u000a      and proteomics that provided the basic science underpinning our\u000a      understanding of molecular, biochemical, and physiological aspects of\u000a      omega-3 LC-PUFA metabolism in fish (2006-12; Monroig et al., 2010; Morais\u000a      et al., 2011). A major impact of these studies was that retention of\u000a      omega-3 LC-PUFA in flesh was a heritable trait in Atlantic salmon and so\u000a      could be enhanced by selective breeding (2009-11; Leaver et al., 2011).\u000a      Another impact was fish genes cloned in our lab being utilised in studies\u000a      to introduce the LC-PUFA biosynthesis trait into oilseed crops (Robert et\u000a      al., 2005).\u000a    Six projects had international partners with the Nutrition Group being a\u000a      core consortium partner in all these projects (coordinator of FOSIS and\u000a      RAFOA) and the lead partner with respect to fish oil substitution and\u000a      omega-3 LC-PUFA metabolism and nutrition. Uptake of these research\u000a      findings has been through very direct pathways as all the research was\u000a      performed in collaboration with the major global feed companies (BioMar,\u000a      EWOS and Skretting), either as partners in major RCUK (FOSIS) or EU\u000a      projects (RAFOA, FORM, AQUAMAX &amp; ARRAINA), or through industry-led\u000a      collaborative projects with BioMar and EWOS. In most cases the studies\u000a      were also performed in collaboration with major fish producers, such as\u000a      Marine Harvest, in their own facilities for semi-commercial scale trials\u000a      using sea pen cages and fish grown to market size. Many projects included\u000a      other key players in the aquaculture supply chain including oil producers\u000a      (Croda, DSM, Technology Crops Inc), fish breeding companies (Landcatch\u000a      Natural Selection), processors (Pinneys), retailers (Sainsburys), and\u000a      trade organisations (Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, Federation of\u000a      European Aquaculture Producers). All results were disseminated widely in\u000a      the scientific literature, at conferences and workshops, and in trade and\u000a      technical reports and the national press. This led to the rapid\u000a      application of the findings in the form of new commercial formulations and\u000a      feeding strategy recommendations that were made widely available so that\u000a      beneficiaries included the entire aquaculture sector from feed\u000a      ingredients, feed manufacture, fish producers and processors, to retailers\u000a      and consumers including SMEs. Key to this was the role of the Nutrition\u000a      Group as principal partners in an EU FP5 Thematic Network (FORM, Fish oil\u000a      and meal replacement) with a specific KT\/KE remit focussed on exchange of\u000a      information and an output consisting entirely of exploitation and\u000a      dissemination activities primarily through four annual meetings\/workshops\u000a      where our results were presented to a wide audience of key stakeholders\u000a      including the aquaculture industry, trade organisations, consumer groups\u000a      and health and safety authorities.\u000a    The Nutrition Group has been at the heart of the consultations and\u000a      committees defining aquaculture nutrition research not only in the UK and\u000a      Europe but also globally. In the early phase of EU FP6, the Nutrition\u000a      Group, along with our key collaborators in Norway (NIFES) and France\u000a      (INRA), developed an Expression of Interest that was adopted by the EU and\u000a      resulted in two new Calls, providing research funding of almost &#8364;25\u000a      million to the SEAFOODplus and AQUAMAX projects that spearheaded EU\u000a      research in aquaculture nutrition over the subsequent years (2006-2010).\u000a      Bell was a key member of the European Aquaculture Technology and\u000a      Innovation Platform (EATIP) (2008-2010) and was leader of Goal 1 tasked\u000a      with a remit to \"Strengthen sustainability of aquaculture by developing\u000a      Future Fish Feeds based on a sound scientific basis\". The EATIP programme\u000a      was adopted in an EU FP7 call on aquafeeds that was answered by the\u000a      ARRAINA project in which the Nutrition Group are members of the core\u000a      consortium. Recently, Tocher was an appointed member of the US National\u000a      Academies, National Research Council (NRC) Committee on Nutrient\u000a      Requirements of Fish and Shrimp. This Committee was convened for the first\u000a      time in 20 years with responsibility to completely update the NRC Bulletin\u000a      on Nutrient Requirements of Fish, last produced in 1993. The NRC Report is\u000a      universally regarded throughout the world as the \"Gold Standard\", and the\u000a      new Report \"Nutrient Requirements of Fish and Shrimp\" was published in\u000a      August 2011. All of the above contributed to the high regard the\u000a      aquaculture industry have for the research of the Nutrition Group. This\u000a      resulted in the Group being in great demand to carry out both contract\u000a      work and analyses, and the establishment of the Nutrition Analytical\u000a      Service (NAS), the highly successful commercial arm of the Nutrition Group\u000a      with over 40 customers around the globe and an annual turnover of almost\u000a      &#163;0.45 million.\u000a    The impact of our work is readily attested by key industrial partners:\u000a    \"The economic benefits have been far reaching both in reduction of\u000a      overall production costs and in facilitating increased growth in this\u000a      sector.

Fish are the\u000a      major source of omega-3 LC-PUFA in the human diet, and its level was\u000a      maintained in farmed fish through the use of fish oil as a major component\u000a      of extruded aquafeeds. Around 10 years ago it became clear that demand for\u000a      fish oil would rapidly outstrip supply, limiting expansion of aquaculture\u000a      activities, if fish oil use was not reduced. The challenge this presented\u000a      was that alternatives to fish oil lack omega-3 LC-PUFA. However,\u000a      replacement of fish oil with more sustainable alternatives is now standard\u000a      practice in the industry. Research into fish oil replacement and omega-3\u000a      metabolism in the Nutrition Group, Institute of Aquaculture has been at\u000a      the forefront of the scientific research in the UK and Europe that has\u000a      ensured nutritional quality of farmed fish by developing alternative feed\u000a      ingredients and feeding strategies that have maintained levels of omega-3\u000a      LC-PUFA despite radical changes to feed composition driven by\u000a      sustainability and food security.

Thus it is crucial that the levels of these fatty\u000a      acids should be maintained in farmed fish and seafood products.\u000a      Over-exploitation of wild fisheries has meant that about 50% of fish and\u000a      seafood for human consumption is now farmed and aquaculture is the fastest\u000a      growing global food production system. Aquaculture has been highly\u000a      dependent on dietary fish oil and fishmeal derived from marine fisheries,\u000a      representing a production system that is, at best, at its sustainable\u000a      limit. Continued expansion of aquaculture, which is essential to meet the\u000a      global demand for fish, is only therefore possible by replacing\u000a      marine-derived resources with alternative nutrient sources.

In\u000a      some sectors of the aquaculture industry disease losses can reach up to\u000a      40% of a fish population, threatening the very existence of certain\u000a      sectors. Prior to the introduction of vaccines, antibiotics were the only\u000a      method of controlling bacterial diseases.\u000a    Fish immunology research at the Institute of Aquaculture has contributed\u000a      essential tools and methods to assist in the development of fish vaccines\u000a      since 1993. The group has close links with industry and much of the\u000a      research has been undertaken with funding from major pharmaceutical\u000a      companies, leading to commercialisation of the vaccines developed\u000a      (Furunculosis, Pasteurellosis, Bacillary Necrosis).\u000a    In order to develop an effective vaccine the protective antigens need to\u000a      be identified and their protective response confirmed in the host species.\u000a      As very few reagents were available to monitor the immune response or to\u000a      identify pathogens in fish, this became one of the main tasks for the\u000a      group at Stirling (1993-date) and a wide range of monoclonal antibodies\u000a      (mAbs) and standard operating procedures were developed for this purpose1.The\u000a      fish health group has also made significant contributions to the\u000a      elucidation of host-pathogen interactions and characterisation of\u000a      pathogens for a number of fish species and diseases leading to vaccine\u000a      development e.g. Furunculosis 2 in salmonids,\u000a      Pasteurellosis3,4 in sea bass and sea bream, Aeromonad\u000a      septicaemia in carp and Tilapia 5, and Bacillary Necrosis in Pangasius\u000a      catfish6.\u000a    Development of methods to identify the antigens expressed by pathogens\u000a      during infection was also important so that potential vaccine candidates\u000a      could be isolated and tested. The team focused on differential expression\u000a      of pathogen antigens under different culture conditions leading to the\u000a      successful development of vaccines. This was first approached in 1995\u000a      using iron restriction conditions to culture Aeromonas salmonicida in\u000a        vitro2 and a vaccine to protect against\u000a      Furunculosis was subsequently developed. A similar approach was used to\u000a      develop a Pasteurellosis vaccine for use in Mediterranean fish species\u000a      (1997-2003)3,4. Aeromonas hydrophila is very\u000a      heterogeneous and therefore vaccine development was particularly\u000a      difficult, so more recently the team took a different approach in that the\u000a      bacteria were actually cultured in vivo in culture chambers rather\u000a      than manipulating the in vitro culture media. In addition,\u000a      immunoproteomics was used to identify common vaccine antigens between the\u000a      field isolates. This time a recombinant vaccine was successfully developed\u000a      (2005-2010)5. Finally, the first commercial fish vaccine for\u000a      use in Pangasius catfish was recently developed. This vaccine\u000a      protects against bacterial necrosis from Edwardsiella ictaluri\u000a      which is the most significant disease affecting the catfish sector in\u000a      Asia. The research performed at Stirling (2006-2011) provided the original\u000a      disease diagnosis, pathogen identification and screening of vaccine\u000a      candidates6. This is an extremely important development as the\u000a      use of antibiotics in Vietnamese aquaculture has been a cause for concern.\u000a    Key staff working on vaccine development include Adams (1995-present),\u000a      Thompson (1993- present), Richards (1979-present) and Crumlish\u000a      (1999-present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44473","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    AERU's 2006-12 research, described above, has significantly improved the\u000a      scientific understanding of ways to reduce agriculture-related net\u000a      greenhouse gas emissions and help meet national and European targets.\u000a      Since AERU identified modifications in specific farming practices to\u000a      encourage greenhouse gas emission reductions and enhance the carbon\u000a      storage in soils and biomass, various policy instruments have incorporated\u000a      the recommended changes, and a range of guidance materials for farmers,\u000a      their advisors and policy makers have been developed.\u000a    For example, the Environmental Stewardship scheme evaluations highlighted\u000a      a number of prescribed practice alterations that would reduce net\u000a      emissions. These included: reducing soil cultivation depth to decrease\u000a      fuel consumption; encouraging springtime manure application to improve\u000a      crop nutrient availability and reduce ammonia emissions; prohibiting the\u000a      application of inorganic nitrogen fertilisers to rush pastures, in order\u000a      to reduce soil emissions; and increasing the width of non-cropped margins\u000a      around woodland to eliminate soil disturbance and so increase carbon\u000a      sequestration. The study also recommended additional practices that the\u000a      scheme should encourage, such as hedgerow restoration. Defra accepted all\u000a      of these recommendations, and they are an established part of the ES\u000a      Scheme.\u000a    It is difficult to quantify the impact on reducing greenhouse gas\u000a      emissions, but one rough indicator can help place it in perspective: in\u000a      2009, 2.44 million ha of farmland was managed under ES agreements. If\u000a      management of just 5% of this land shows a modest 0.5% increase in soil\u000a      organic carbon in the top 10cm of soil, roughly an additional 22t\/ha\u000a      carbon dioxide is sequestered, or around 2.7 million tonnes in total &#8212;\u000a      equivalent to approximately 0.5 million passenger flights around the earth\u000a      (40,000 kilometres). AERU's research is specifically mentioned as a\u000a      guidance source for the South West Climate Action Plan 2008-2010, which\u000a      describes the activities required to support the region mitigate and adapt\u000a      to the impacts of climate change. A Defra publication reviewing the\u000a      success of the agri-environment schemes also references it, and a Natural\u000a      England contact has stated that AERU's ES scheme work is at the heart of\u000a      their evidence base for this subject area.\u000a    Since November 2012, Rural Development Programme (RDP) Managing\u000a      Authorities in EU member states have been using the OSCAR project's\u000a      guidance manual and online software to optimise the design of national\u000a      programmes to ensure that, as well as delivering the main RDP objectives\u000a      of restoring and enhancing the competitiveness of rural areas and farming,\u000a      they also deliver climate change benefits. Contacts at Defra and Natural\u000a      England have stated that AERU's OSCAR and Environmental Stewardship work\u000a      will be used to support their the ES Schemes development work in the next\u000a      financial phase of the Common Agricultural Policy.\u000a    AERU's research has also influenced farming methods across Europe.\u000a      Farmers must comply with all aspects of the ES scheme to receive subsidies\u000a      and grants, which consequently creates climate change benefits. Natural\u000a      England and Defra have used the ES research to formulate a suite of land\u000a      management guidance material for farmers and other land managers, aiming\u000a      to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions on their land. For\u000a      example, Natural England published a farmers' guidance manual and a poster\u000a      entitled `Making the most of Environmental Stewardship'. A Technical\u000a      Information Note for land managers and advisers (TIN107) explained how the\u000a      right farming practices can make a significant difference to greenhouse\u000a      gas reductions.\u000a    AERU's National Trust work generated guidance material for farmers on the\u000a      Wallington estate, including detailed maps showing where to spatially\u000a      target specific practices, and step-by-step guidance material to help\u000a      mitigate emissions. Trialled by an independent consultant, this material\u000a      has been used with regional Natural England and National Trust advisors,\u000a      to extend the reach of the research to National Trust estates across\u000a      England and Wales.\u000a    Farmers are encouraged to monitor and manage their carbon emissions by\u000a      using carbon calculators. Lack of sensitivity to farming practices omits\u000a      potential reductions to the carbon balance, and renders them unsuitable\u000a      for action plan development. AERU's research is changing this. Its\u000a      calculator (IMPACCT), freely available to farmers, was designed\u000a      specifically for formulating mitigation and adaption plans. Core data from\u000a      this research programme informs other publicly available calculators. As a\u000a      contact at Natural England can confirm, the CALM tool, a widely\u000a      disseminated, third-party software tool, has implemented AERU's data to\u000a      upgrade and make it more useful to ES Scheme farmers. It is used by\u000a      farmers worldwide; the CALM website (www.calm.cla.org.uk)\u000a      also reports that land managers use it to help secure supermarket\u000a      contracts and reach grain quality assurance standards.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2005 the Agriculture and Environment Research Unit has undertaken\u000a      an extensive programme of research related to mitigating the climate\u000a      change impacts arising from agricultural land management policies and\u000a      practices.

AERU's remit is to carry\u000a      out research related to understanding the environmental impact of\u000a      agriculture and, in particular, agricultural policy to enable more\u000a      scientifically informed policy development. Since 2005 AERU has examined\u000a      the effect of farm land management practices on climate change. Many such\u000a      practices could mitigate climate change by improving long-term carbon\u000a      storage in soil and vegetation, i.e. carbon sequestration, whereby carbon\u000a      is captured from the atmosphere through natural processes. However, some\u000a      farm practices may also lead to stored soil carbon being released when\u000a      soil is disturbed. AERU has sought to identify how these practices can\u000a      mitigate climate change and help the UK and European governments meet\u000a      greenhouse gas emission targets.\u000a    AERU's research contributed significantly to the Environmental\u000a      Stewardship (ES) scheme, which pays English farmers to protect and enhance\u000a      biodiversity and the environment. For Defra, AERU developed an approach\u000a      for assessing all scheme-advocated farming practices and identifying those\u000a      best able to reduce carbon emissions or increase sequestration without\u000a      compromising its key aims. The scheme was subsequently modified, and the\u000a      2006 project repeated in 2011 to ensure that AERU's recommendations\u000a      remained valid. In 2012, Natural England commissioned related work to\u000a      consider whether farmers taking land out of production under the scheme\u000a      might intensify greenhouse gas production elsewhere, displacing rather\u000a      than reducing emissions. This study found that the concerns were largely\u000a      invalid.\u000a    AERU also contributed to the Nitrate Vulnerable Zone Action Programme\u000a      (NVZAP), a statutory programme that all farmers in designated areas must\u000a      observe to minimise nitrate leaching to water bodies. Under the\u000a      legislative process, the costs and environmental benefits of the\u000a      programme's measures had to be understood, and particularly how these\u000a      would affect greenhouse gas emissions and UK emission targets. Aiming for\u000a      a consistent approach across the different policy instruments, Defra asked\u000a      AERU to apply the same ES Scheme assessment methodology to NVZAP. The\u000a      study found that NVZAP would reduce carbon emissions, and helped it to\u000a      become law.\u000a    In 2010, the National Trust commissioned AERU to produce a Carbon Land\u000a      Management Plan for its 5,300ha Wallington Estate in Northumberland.\u000a      Again, the same methodology was employed to identify specific land\u000a      management practices that the estate could use to encourage carbon\u000a      sequestration and preserve existing carbon stocks. The resulting\u000a      `blueprint' provides guidance to farm tenants on other Trust estates\u000a      (Section 3, Ref. 1).\u000a    Between 2009 and 2012, AERU'S methodology was turned towards reducing the\u000a      impact on climate change caused by European farming activities. IMPACCT,\u000a      the first of two European Commission projects, developed a carbon balance\u000a      model for integrated whole-farm assessment, encouraging practices that\u000a      would decrease greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration,\u000a      within a sustainable balance of environmental, social and economic\u000a      objectives. Unlike other carbon accounting tools, IMPACCT &#8212; freely\u000a      available to all EU farmers &#8212; goes beyond estimating net greenhouse gas\u000a      emissions, being designed for high sensitivity to farming practice changes\u000a      and developing farm-specific, pragmatic and cost-benefit optimised\u000a      mitigation plans (Ref. 2).\u000a    `OSCAR' (2011-12) extended the methodology EU-wide, aiming to identify\u000a      whether land management measures encouraged by the European Rural\u000a      Development Programme (RDP), via farm subsidies and grants, could be\u000a      optimised to mitigate climate change and enable greater adaptation to its\u000a      effects whilst considering the diverse agricultural industries,\u000a      landscapes, climates and environments within the EU-27. In November 2012,\u000a      the European Commission launched the resulting tools, aiming to help all\u000a      RDP Managing Authorities evaluate national programmes and optimise them\u000a      for carbon emission reduction.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44474","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Environmental Management for Agriculture software, developed in the\u000d\u000a      late 1990s, was the first true environmental management system for\u000d\u000a      farmers. Two key spin-off outputs, with a clear line back to EMA, have had\u000d\u000a      a significant impact in making data and information readily available to\u000d\u000a      agencies working in environmental protection or the farming industry,\u000d\u000a      nationally and internationally.\u000d\u000a    1. The Online Pesticide Properties Database (PPDB)\u000d\u000a    The online Pesticide Properties Database (PPDB), launched in 2007,\u000d\u000a      introduced a single, globally available, comprehensive pesticide data\u000d\u000a      resource. Pesticide risk parameters had previously proven difficult to\u000d\u000a      collate, with data being scattered across organisations and publications,\u000d\u000a      often unreliable, and frequently commercially protected. Databases had\u000d\u000a      significant gaps, providing information only on more common substances,\u000d\u000a      and no resource included data on pesticide breakdown products, although\u000d\u000a      they were often significant for risk assessments. Project-specific\u000d\u000a      databases were developed for each university, governmental, NGO or\u000d\u000a      commercial research task: this was time-consuming, costly, and frequently\u000d\u000a      under-resourced. Data paucity and access to journals &#8212; a significant\u000d\u000a      problem in developing countries &#8212; also led to data quality concerns, and\u000d\u000a      inevitably affected risk assessments.\u000d\u000a    PPDB therefore plugged an information gap, saved pesticide researchers\u000d\u000a      considerable time and funding bodies money, and provided much-needed\u000d\u000a      information on data quality. The harmonised dataset also allows for more\u000d\u000a      consistency in pesticide risk assessments.\u000d\u000a    Access has increased exponentially since 2008, when 132,000 pages were\u000d\u000a      downloaded, rising to 989,000 in 2012 and expected to easily exceed 1\u000d\u000a      million in 2013. The database is used worldwide, but predominantly in\u000d\u000a      Europe, North and South America, Australia and India, by end users working\u000d\u000a      at, for example, pesticide manufacturers, agricultural consultancies and\u000d\u000a      universities. A random literature search for 2009 to February 2012 found\u000d\u000a      over 100 journal publications citing the PPDB as a main data source. It is\u000d\u000a      licensed for offline use to major organisations who protect and manage\u000d\u000a      natural resources, such as the US Geological Survey; the French Geological\u000d\u000a      Survey organisation BRGM; and pesticide companies including Bayer,\u000d\u000a      Monsanto and Syngenta. The Danish Environmental Protection Agency use the\u000d\u000a      PPDB as the key data source for calculating their national pesticide\u000d\u000a      impact indicator, which underpins their pesticide tax and farm advisory\u000d\u000a      systems. Waitrose Foods use a similar approach with the PPDB to inform\u000d\u000a      their global crop protection policy.\u000d\u000a    The PPDB is globally acknowledged as possibly the most\u000d\u000a      comprehensive resource of its type. The eminent International Union of\u000d\u000a      Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), for example, endorses the database and\u000d\u000a      provides access to it via its own website, and a well-respected pesticide\u000d\u000a      scientist at the US Department of Agriculture has stated that the PPDB\u000d\u000a      `has become the best [pesticide] database available in the world' (see\u000d\u000a      section 5, `Institutional Corroboration').\u000d\u000a    2. The ADLib Resource\u000d\u000a    Many British organisations such as Defra, Natural England, the Farmers\u000d\u000a      Union, the Environment Agency and ADAS produce guidance material for\u000d\u000a      farmers and their advisors, disseminating it chiefly via direct mailshot\u000d\u000a      and their websites. Farmers and their advisors must therefore actively\u000d\u000a      search for information from these sources, or be alerted to new and\u000d\u000a      relevant publications by a third party.\u000d\u000a    By holding documents produced by these and other organisations in\u000d\u000a      electronic hyperlinked form, ADLib addressed this issue, becoming a\u000d\u000a      knowledge transfer service to the British agricultural industry and\u000d\u000a      quickly disseminating key and new information to end users. It underpins\u000d\u000a      Defra's online farming support services delivered by GOV.UK, a\u000d\u000a      government-funded website for information about government services that\u000d\u000a      provides access to key documents, forms, best practice information, etc.\u000d\u000a      This service has over 17,000 registered users and, according to online\u000d\u000a      traffic analysis, many more that are unregistered.\u000d\u000a    ADLib also provides the support material for the Agriculture and\u000d\u000a      Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) ihub, which offers free access to\u000d\u000a      climate change mitigation and adaptation advice for the UK farming\u000d\u000a      industry. Other organisations offer ADLib to their members: the Fertiliser\u000d\u000a      Advisers Certification and Training Scheme (FACTS), for example, provides\u000d\u000a      its 2,000-strong membership with access to fertiliser best-practice\u000d\u000a      support material and scheme-specific documentation.\u000d\u000a    ADLib overcomes issues such as copyright, format variety, maintenance\u000d\u000a      costs and version management by bringing together previously scattered\u000d\u000a      information from government agencies and departments, as well as small\u000d\u000a      specialist organisations. It offers timely and targeted delivery of advice\u000d\u000a      to farmers and their advisors, saving them time and money when seeking\u000d\u000a      appropriate information, and ensuring they are kept up-to-date.

AERU was established in\u000d\u000a      1995 to undertake a major project that developed a computer-based\u000d\u000a      environmental management system for farms. This system, known as\u000d\u000a      Environmental Management for Agriculture, or EMA (see section 3, Refs 1\u000d\u000a      &amp; 2), was groundbreaking in several ways. First, it was one of the\u000d\u000a      first computerised decision-support systems designed specifically for\u000d\u000a      farmers at a time when on-farm computer use was uncommon. Second, making\u000d\u000a      use of a wide range of environmental impact models, it could identify and\u000d\u000a      rank environmental issues according to severity, thereby pinpointing those\u000d\u000a      that should be tackled on-farm. It also provided site-specific advice for\u000d\u000a      impact mitigation and management and thus, for the first time in the UK,\u000d\u000a      brought the concept of environmental management systems onto farms.\u000d\u000a    AERU released the software commercially in 1998. Despite initial\u000d\u000a      scepticism, EMA quickly became popular with farmers and their advisers,\u000d\u000a      and four updated versions subsequently followed. The software won several\u000d\u000a      awards during its lifespan and sold over 3,600 copies on CD-Rom. Although\u000d\u000a      now `retired', EMA continues to underpin a programme of interrelated\u000d\u000a      research projects and the development of various spin-off products. Two of\u000d\u000a      these in particular have made a real difference to the British and\u000d\u000a      international agricultural communities (in Europe, USA, Australia, south\u000d\u000a      America, and many other locations).\u000d\u000a    Part of the original EMA package evaluated the environmental impact of\u000d\u000a      pesticides using a simple risk-assessment model driven by a database of\u000d\u000a      physico-chemical parameters. This was successfully evaluated as part of\u000d\u000a      the 1999 EU-funded CAPER project (section 3, Ref. 4, and Key Research\u000d\u000a      Award 3), leading to the development of a more sophisticated and\u000d\u000a      innovative version under the Defra-funded p-EMA project (1999-2000) (Ref.\u000d\u000a      4). The lessons learnt about the delivery of complex systems to farmers\u000d\u000a      were further exploited in the EU-funded FOOTPRINT project, a Europe-wide\u000d\u000a      modelling software development initiative in which AERU's role was to\u000d\u000a      develop a risk assessment tool for farmers and their advisors. A key part\u000d\u000a      of all these decision-support tools was the embedded pesticide database\u000d\u000a      and, due to demand from academics, researchers, regulators and industry,\u000d\u000a      it has been constantly maintained and expanded.

The extent of the influence was quantified to enable\u000d\u000a        clear priorities to be established for measures to reduce contamination.\u000d\u000a      The underpinning research involved the collection of three hundred\u000d\u000a        samples of wheat per year from fields of known agronomy over a number of\u000d\u000a        seasons. These were analysed for ten trichothecene mycotoxins, including\u000d\u000a        deoxynivalenol (DON), and zearalenone. The mycotoxin concentration was\u000d\u000a        statistically modelled against the agronomic practices (e.g. variety,\u000d\u000a        cultivation and previous crop) applied to each field, to quantify the\u000d\u000a        extent of influence of each agronomic factor found to be important.\u000d\u000a      The research was a five-year project started in 2001.\u000d\u000a      The research was supervised by Dr (now Professor) Simon Edwards, who\u000d\u000a        was Reader in Plant Pathology at the time.\u000d\u000a      The context for the project was that the introduction was anticipated\u000d\u000a        of European Commission (EC) legislative limits for the fusarium\u000d\u000a        mycotoxins, DON and zearalenone in cereals and cereal products.

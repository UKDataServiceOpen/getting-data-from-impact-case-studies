The linkage of the research to wine production and\u000d\u000aoperations has informed policy, regulations and guidelines relevant to the sector through enhanced\u000d\u000aenergy awareness with the main beneficiaries being the local wine industry, their associations and\u000d\u000agoverning bodies. The reach of the case study is extensive with individual wineries, vineyards,\u000d\u000aprofessional bodies, institutions and the wider supply chain benefitting in different countries\u000d\u000aincluding the emerging winemaking industry in the UK.\u000d\u000aLocal wine industry associations and governing bodies; UKVA Sustainability Programme, UKVA\u000d\u000aregional bodies SEVA (South East Vineyard Association) (corroborating statement 1, source\u000d\u000a5.1) and MVA (Mercian Vineyard Association) (source 5.2) and the UK Wineskills Programme\u000d\u000a(source 5.3) have benefitted from the underpinning research through increased knowledge of how\u000d\u000asystems operate in an energy context with consequential cost savings. Collectively, the data\u000d\u000aaccumulated during the case study has led to the development of the first set of UK relevant\u000d\u000abenchmarks and the establishment of an industry Energy Working Group for UK wine producers\u000d\u000aand industry stakeholders. The Energy Working Group is the first of its kind in the UK. Smyth is an\u000d\u000aenergy expert for the UKVA and sits on the working group as an expert witness thereby facilitating\u000d\u000athe process through which research outcomes directly impact on energy policy and subsequent\u000d\u000aimplementation by the UK industry. The UK energy benchmark study provides an up to date\u000d\u000arepresentation of the industry's current energy requirement on which future sustainable\u000d\u000aprogrammes are being developed (source 5.4).\u000d\u000aEvaluating the energy demand of winemaking facilities through specific auditing procedures\u000d\u000adeveloped by the CST team and underpinning research (including solar energy) has had a major\u000d\u000aimpact on individual operating performances, resulting in cost saving and environmental benefits.\u000d\u000aThe underpinning research has contributed to the development of a patented solar water heater\u000d\u000a(source 5.5) that has particular application to hot water usage in the wine making industry. The\u000d\u000asolar water heater is being commercialised as SolaCatcher through Solaform Ltd, a University of\u000d\u000aUlster spin-out company (source 5.6).\u000d\u000aEnergy audits conducted for individual wineries have significance through a direct impact upon the\u000d\u000astrategy, operations and management practices of that facility and changing wine production\u000d\u000aactivities to adopt greater sustainability procedures. Information from the energy audits has had a\u000d\u000afundamental impact in changing the attitude of the UK winemaking industry. Many wineries have\u000d\u000abeen empowered through the knowledge provided from the audits to review and change their\u000d\u000aoperating policy and management tailored to a greener agenda. This is evidenced through written\u000d\u000asupport from a range of wine producers (SMEs) spanning the full spectrum of wine making in the\u000d\u000aUK and the USA. As an example, the research enabled senior management at Domaine\u000d\u000aCarneros in California, to evaluate and compare their systems, processes and plant against\u000d\u000aaccepted Californian benchmark values and provided information that permitted the winery to\u000d\u000aanalyse energy consumption trends and patterns and instigate improvements in energy usage\u000d\u000a(corroborating statement 2, source 5.7). In the UK, a number of English wineries had an immediate\u000d\u000aimpact from their participation in the study. Following the energy audit, each winery was given a\u000d\u000adetailed report on their energy usage and benchmark including the award winning Ridgeview Wine\u000d\u000aEstate (corroborating statement 3, source 5.8). Each winery used this information to implement\u000d\u000aenergy saving measures that led to a reduction in energy usage and economic savings.\u000d\u000aThe research has also impacted on the building of new wineries in the UK, the wider supply chain\u000d\u000aand professionals involved in their construction. The UK wine industry is set to expand significantly\u000d\u000ain the next decade and the building of energy sustainable wine facilities is crucial. This research\u000d\u000ahas already been used by a number of producers with impact apparent through changes in the\u000d\u000adesign of their wineries to reduce the energy requirements in their processes and operations.\u000d\u000aAncre Hill Estates (corroborating statement 4, source 5.9) is an example of how the research\u000d\u000ahas directed the design (and energy use) of their proposed new winery and how this research\u000d\u000awas used by their design consultants.\u000d\u000aThe research has resulted in the production of wine within stricter, defined energy benchmarks\u000d\u000athereby improving the environmental credentials of the industry whilst reducing energy use and\u000d\u000aassociated emissions. This research determined that the collective UK winery operations used\u000d\u000a2,008 MWhs of energy in 2011, equivalent to 1181 barrels of crude oil, producing 736.8 tonnes of\u000d\u000aCO2. As the industry is in the midst of rapid expansion (production increased fourfold over the past\u000d\u000adecade), the Energy Working Group, using the energy benchmark established by Smyth at 0.557\u000d\u000akWh\/litre, has set this as a desired upper limit for all UK wine production as evidenced by\u000d\u000aprominent English producers (source 5.4).\u000d\u000aThe impact of this study is not limited to the wine industry but is applicable to the much larger food\u000d\u000aand drink industry. Through an Inter-trade Ireland Fusion project, the research team provided\u000d\u000aexpertise to Errigal Seafood, demonstrating the wider reach of the accumulated knowledge and\u000d\u000aexpertise. The company's thermal energy bill in 2011 was &#8364;445,847. Using the transferable skills,\u000d\u000aknowledge and expertise developed in the wine study, the team were able to directly impact\u000d\u000asavings in the shellfish production facility. The research through streamlining the company's\u000d\u000aproduction processes led to a 15% reduction in energy used, equating to &#8364;89,184 and 42.3 tonnes\u000d\u000aof CO2 saved (corroborating statement 5, source 5.10).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis case study concerns the long term (energy) sustainability of emerging winemaking regions.\u000d\u000aUnderpinning research in energy efficiency and renewable technologies informs the case study in\u000d\u000adetermining energy usage and benchmarks, development of energy guidelines\/policy,\u000d\u000aimplementation by national professional bodies and adoption of energy best practice by the local\u000d\u000aindustry.

The research is underpinned by the\u000d\u000aactivities of a team led by Smyth (currently Reader, previously Lecturer since 1998) and three\u000d\u000acolleagues Hewitt (Professor since 2007 in post continuously since 1996), Zacharopoulos\u000d\u000a(Research Fellow appointed 2007), Mondol (Lecturer appointed 2008, previously Research Fellow\u000d\u000asince 2006). CST's fundamental research in the area of solar materials, novel collector designs,\u000d\u000aadvanced optics and thermal transfer\/storage (ref 3.1, 3.2), played a central role in these\u000d\u000aachievements. CST has long been recognised as a leading research group in UK solar energy.\u000d\u000aUnder the directorship of Professors Norton and Eames in the 1990s\/early 2000s, and now Hewitt,\u000d\u000aCST has developed significant expertise, experience and facilities in the modelling and evaluation\u000d\u000aof solar technologies such as the development and experimental characterisation of low cost\u000d\u000afacade integrated concentrator photovoltaics (funded through the EPSRC's Clean Technology,\u000d\u000aPhotovoltaics Programme and the European Union JOULE Programme). The underpinning\u000d\u000aresearch conducted by the team at CST, including internationally recognised award winning papers\u000d\u000a(for example ref 3.3), prestigious grants (grants 3a-g) and international patents, has been\u000d\u000ainstrumental in informing the current case study. Based on a fundamental understanding of the\u000d\u000ademand driven energy requirements in commercial\/industrial buildings and their respective\u000d\u000aprocesses, the team has conducted extensive research into those energy related synergies that\u000d\u000aalternative\/renewable technologies, in particular solar technologies, provide coupled with specific\u000d\u000aenergy supply\/storage requirements. This research has led to a number of innovative technologies,\u000d\u000asuch as SolaCatcher, a passive solar water heater (ref 3.2) that gained national awareness\u000d\u000athrough the `Make it in GB' competition 2012 at the Science Museum, London.\u000d\u000aThe connection between solar energy research and the wine industry started in 2002 when Smyth\u000d\u000adeveloped a novel solar quilt to provide passive frost protection to young vines (ref 3.4). To\u000d\u000acommercialise this technology, Smyth developed a University of Ulster spinout company,\u000d\u000aSOLVEDNI Ltd (2003) supported by an Invest NI Compete Award (Solar Frost Protection for\u000d\u000aVineyards, 2004). A patent was applied for in 2004 and Smyth during a sabbatical period at\u000d\u000aVictoria University of Wellington (VUW), NZ (with Skates) received a VicLink grant (Passive Solar\u000d\u000aWater Heating System For Vineyard Frost Protection, Product Research and Development award,\u000d\u000a2005) to field trial the solar quilt at two vineyards; Gladstone and Nobillio. The results of this novel\u000d\u000aresearch lead to several publications in 2006 and was the catalyst to further research.\u000d\u000aThe success of the solar quilt led to a number of solar-agri products involving collaborations with\u000d\u000athe Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (NI), Romberg GmbH, Eglantine Vineyard, Plumpton     \u000d\u000aCollege and Tubex Ltd. Continued research by Smyth (with Russell, Humbolt University, USA) led\u000d\u000ato publications on solar applications in the wine industry (ref 3.5) and in 2009 with Milanowski\u000d\u000a(Plumpton College), Smyth published a book `Solar Energy in the Winemaking Industry' through\u000d\u000aSpringer Publishing (2011). Smyth was awarded a prestigious Royal Academy of Engineering\u000d\u000aGlobal Research Award (2010) (grant 3e) to take up a six month secondment with the solar winery,\u000d\u000aDomaine Carneros in California. This work initially sought to investigate solar system design and its\u000d\u000aapplication in winery buildings but rapidly evolved to explore the synergies between solar energy\u000d\u000asupply and wine production energy demand.

The expertise has subsequently been applied to the North\u000d\u000aCarolina wine industry and more recently to the UK wine industry (ref 3.6). In particular Smyth and\u000d\u000ahis colleagues, with the UKVA (UK Vineyard Association) Sustainability Programme, UKVA\u000d\u000aregional bodies and UK Wineskills Programme, have applied their research in energy monitoring,\u000d\u000aenergy supply and demand relationships to determine the only energy benchmarking standard for\u000d\u000athe UK wine industry and develop a framework to support guidelines and policy.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"57","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe impact of the underpinning research concerns technology transfer to companies mainly in the\u000d\u000aSME sector, with reach apparent in terms of both the diversity of manufacturing companies and\u000d\u000atheir geographical location (Ireland, UK and Europe). Significance is through improving the quality\u000d\u000aof products and sales, as well as the establishment of scientifically based assessment for the\u000d\u000asubstitution of halogenated fire retardants by environmentally compatible fire retardants.\u000d\u000aTechnology transfer of our methodology to modify, predict and model fire performance has been\u000d\u000autilised extensively by industry. Applications include the development of new high performance\u000d\u000afabrics, high fire resistance wall or floor insulation, manufacturing of new fire doors and improved\u000d\u000aintumescent coatings. The significance of the research lies in the impact on production systems in\u000d\u000athese areas and ultimately, has been incorporated into products used in a range of circumstances\u000d\u000aembracing both domestic and commercial environments. Thus the reach of the impact whilst\u000d\u000ainitially with specific companies has, through incorporation into products, been extended to other\u000d\u000aapplications.\u000d\u000aExamples of manufacturing companies employing the underpinning research are SITEX (high\u000d\u000aperformance fabrics), Pollock Lifts (designers of lifts for disabled people) and Essexford Joinery\u000d\u000a(redevelopment of doors and core materials for doors). New designs implemented by these\u000d\u000acompanies are based on FireSERT's research with benefit apparent in reducing weight, whilst at\u000d\u000athe same time increasing the fire resistance of fabrics (SITEX), floor partitions (Pollock Lifts) and\u000d\u000afire doors (Essexford).\u000d\u000aResearch in FireSERT on flame resistant fabrics for industrial and fire-fighting protective clothing\u000d\u000aprovides an alternative to the traditional meta-aramid fabrics (Dupont Kevlar). Application of these\u000d\u000afabrics by SITEX (corroborating statement 1, source 5.1) has produced a number of benefits in\u000d\u000arelation to fabric\/fibre blends. Fire barrier research on materials in FireSERT has permitted the\u000d\u000aassessment of performance levels needed for fabric systems. This has significance in establishing\u000d\u000anew coating technology that is environmentally safe and boosts performance. Specifically this has\u000d\u000aenabled SITEX to produce fabrics offering a high level of fire protection without using finishes or\u000d\u000aprocesses which are chemically negative with significant environmental gain. Wider societal benefit\u000d\u000ais the reduction in the level of toxic gas in the event of fire (source 5.2). Furthermore, the new\u000d\u000aprotective fabrics are competitive in price and quality relative to existing meta-aramid alternatives.\u000d\u000aFurther evidence of the industrial significance of materials research at FireSERT is the application\u000d\u000aby Pollok Lifts (corroborating statement 2, source 5.3) which, as a manufacturing and service\u000d\u000abased company in the SME sector, has utilised FireSERT's research on the use of nano-particles,\u000d\u000aenvironmentally safe fire retardants and intumescent paints in the improvement and development\u000d\u000aof their 20 Series Homelift (Through Floor Lift). These fire retardants were used to improve the fire\u000d\u000aresistance of floor partitions and have enabled Pollock Lifts to meet and exceed the requirements\u000d\u000aof specific clauses in BS 5900:2012 namely \"Fire protection\" and \"Behaviour of homelift in the\u000d\u000aevent of fire\". Use of FireSERT research has facilitated the company (Pollock Lifts) in the\u000d\u000adevelopment of a market leading, cost effective product with a reach that extends into different\u000d\u000amarket sectors namely shops, offices, hospitals and residential properties.\u000d\u000aIn the case of Essexford Joinery (corroborating statement 3, source 5.4) a similar procedure was\u000d\u000afollowed transferring FireSERT's research for the design of new doors, through implementation\u000d\u000aand testing the application of new intumescent coatings. The significance of these developments is\u000d\u000aan increase in the fire resistance of doors produced by Essexford which has resulted in an\u000d\u000aincrease in manufacturing output and a product reach across economic sectors (source 5.5).\u000d\u000aThese benefits, as illustrated by the experience of such companies, have resulted in superior\u000d\u000aproducts and an increase in sales as an outcome of applying the research developed by\u000d\u000aFireSERT.\u000d\u000aThe methodologies underpinning the research have been applied by companies beyond the UK\u000d\u000aand Ireland. As an example, IRIS Vernici (corroborating statement 4, source 5.6), an Italian based\u000d\u000aSME specialising in production of coatings for the building and manufacturing industry, has used\u000d\u000aFireSERT's research in improving the fire resistance of intumescent coatings by the inclusion of\u000d\u000ananoclays. The underpinning research has played an important role in the development of several\u000d\u000acommercial intumescent coatings (CHAR 17, CHAR 21 and CHAR 22) and, more recently, of the\u000d\u000aunsaturated polyester intumescent system. Significance is in terms of reducing the weight of\u000d\u000acomponents in buildings (for example plasterboard), which facilitates the construction and\u000d\u000arehabilitation of buildings and offers less expensive options. The use of environmentally safe fire\u000d\u000aretardants has assisted IRIS Vernici in surpassing regulation requirements and increasing their\u000d\u000asales.\u000d\u000aFlammability research undertaken as part of the ENFIRO project has contributed to the\u000d\u000adevelopment of a complete Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for regulating the replacement of currently\u000d\u000aused fire retardants (so called brominated) with environmentally friendly fire retardants. The\u000d\u000aenvironmental and toxicological hazards of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) means that a\u000d\u000anumber of these BFRs have already been phased out with ecological benefit to society. Economic\u000d\u000abenefit from the change to environmentally-friendly fire retardants is substantial with forecasts\u000d\u000apredicting a global market for fire retardants of US$6 billion by 2018. In this respect, the\u000d\u000asignificance of flammability research at FireSERT has been to demonstrate cost effectiveness and\u000d\u000asafety issues regarding the use of HFFRs to replace BFRs in products including application in the\u000d\u000acable and electronic industry. The reach of FireSERT's research on fire retardants has also\u000d\u000aimpacted on product development by multi-national companies, for example CLARIANT has\u000d\u000autilised the research at Ulster in the manufacturing and marketing of HFFRs (corroborating\u000d\u000astatement 5, source 5.7).\u000d\u000an summary, the research undertaken at FireSERT on fire safe materials is having significant\u000d\u000aindustrial impact in terms of product development. The properties of these materials (lightweight,\u000d\u000ahigh strength, excellent fire resistance) are fundamental to their significance to industry and have a\u000d\u000areach that is cross-sector in nature with benefit to society through enhanced fire protection.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThe use of fire retardants is a requirement to reduce fire severity and deaths but is also\u000d\u000acontroversial due to environmental (leaching) and health consequences of commonly used\u000d\u000ahalogenated fire retardants. A novel methodology has been developed and validated in the Fire\u000d\u000aSafety Engineering Research and Technology centre (FireSERT), Built Environment Research\u000d\u000aInstitute, for the prediction of large-scale burning behaviour of fire retarded polymers by combining\u000d\u000asmall-scale (mg size) experiments with computer simulations of fire growth and toxicity.

This has enabled the design, development\u000d\u000aand evaluation of fire safe materials through the selection of appropriate fire retardants (reactive or\u000d\u000aadditive) including nanoparticles at a stage prior to the use of such formulations in large-scale\u000d\u000amanufacturing production which may require extensive retooling at significant cost.\u000d\u000aThe fire dynamics and materials research group in FireSERT, where the FIRESAFE research has\u000d\u000abeen advanced, is led by Prof Delichatsios (in post since 2002) and includes Dr Zhang (lecturer\u000d\u000asince 2008) and a number of members of research staff Dr Bakirtzis (2006-2010 and 2012-2013),\u000d\u000aDr Ramani (2010-2013), Dr Suzanne (2010-2012) and Dr Ukleja (2009-2013). The scientific output\u000d\u000aof this research is exemplified by the selected references in Section 3.\u000d\u000aThe research has been supported by grants from EPSRC (grant 3a &#8212; Flames on building facades)\u000d\u000aand European FP6 and FP7 awards (on material fire resistance and fire modelling). In the FP6\u000d\u000aPredFIRE-NANO project (grant 3b &#8212; Predicting Fire Behaviour of Nanocomposites from Intrinsic\u000d\u000aProperties, coordinated by Delichatsios), polymers modified with fire retardants and nanoclays\u000d\u000awere analysed. Small-scale degradation and toxicity tests (mg samples) were initially performed,\u000d\u000afrom which key intrinsic properties of materials were deduced (reference 3.2 and 3.3). These\u000d\u000aproperties can then be incorporated into a numerical model to predict ignition and pyrolysis\u000d\u000abehaviours in a cone calorimeter. The new methodology developed was validated for a nylon\u000d\u000ananocomposite (reference 3.4) and, subsequently, successfully applied to other polymer\u000d\u000ananocomposites (reference 3.5). Further validation of the methodology used flaxboard with\u000d\u000aintumescent coatings with\/without nanoclays. The methodology was also incorporated in a\u000d\u000acomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and validated against experimental data, for which\u000d\u000alarge-scale tests were also conducted (reference 3.6).\u000d\u000aIn September 2009, the research group was awarded a FP7 European project, ENFIRO (grant 3c &#8212;\u000d\u000aLife Cycle Assessment of Environment-Compatible Flame Retardants, Delichatsios and Zhang), as\u000d\u000apart of a consortium including the University of Amsterdam, Stockholm University and Utrecht\u000d\u000aUniversity. This project examined alternative fire retardants (halogen-free fire retardants, HFFRs)\u000d\u000ato replace brominated fire retardants (BFRs), in terms of their impact on environmental and\u000d\u000atoxicological risks, viability of industrial implementation, production of fire retardants and fire safety.\u000d\u000aThe research focussed on flammability testing of HFFRs and BFRs and comparison of their\u000d\u000arespective performance as characterised by three parameters: flame spread, smoke yield and\u000d\u000aefficiency of combustion. The results show that phosphorus-based retardants combined with\u000d\u000ananoclays can achieve better or similar fire performance as BFRs, while producing significantly\u000d\u000aless toxic gases.\u000d\u000aIn 2011, the group was awarded a further FP7 project on the flammability on new light composite\u000d\u000amaterials on new generation aircrafts (grant 3d &#8212; AircraftFire, Fire risks assessment and increase of\u000d\u000apassenger survivability).

In this context, research on releases\u000d\u000aand fires has provided the framework for assessing safety distances and developing safer\u000d\u000acommercial designs. A key example that illustrates industry relevance was a design study (2011)\u000d\u000afor a home refueller for 700 bar hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Research at the University of Ulster, utilising facilities developed under EPSRC\/JIF\u000d\u000afunding (grant 3a), dates from work into modelling and large eddy simulation (LES) of industrial\u000d\u000ascale deflagrations i.e. \"explosions\". Molkov and Makarov (staff since 1999 and 2000 respectively),\u000d\u000afirst showed that vented deflagration overpressure is an indirect function of flow turbulence and\u000d\u000acombustion instabilities (ref 3.1). They collaborated with Shell (2006) discovering the phenomenon\u000d\u000aof coherent deflagrations (ref 3.2), explaining the physical reason for deflagration severity in low\u000d\u000astrength equipment and buildings. Partnership with industry (Tamanini\/FM Global\/USA) and\u000d\u000aacademia (Dobashi\/University of Tokyo\/Japan) (grant 3b) provided the limits for vent cover inertia,\u000d\u000aensuring there is no reduction in the effectiveness of deflagration mitigation when venting and\u000d\u000ainforming EU guidance as outlined in Section 4.\u000d\u000aHySAFER (Molkov\/Makarov) became a partner in the European Network of Excellence \"Safety of\u000d\u000ahydrogen as an energy carrier\" (2004) (grant 3c) expanding the scope of the group's research to\u000d\u000aother physical phenomena underpinning hydrogen safety. A significant number of research grants\u000d\u000afollowed (Section 3) facilitating outputs and informing guidance and technology development.\u000d\u000aHydrogen can permeate (similar to \"seepage\") through the walls of a storage vessel. In an\u000d\u000aenclosed space such as a garage this permeation and dispersion may result in a flammable\u000d\u000aatmosphere unless regulated. Research in HySAFER by Saffers (researcher 2008-2011, lecturer\u000d\u000a2011-2012), Makarov and Molkov in 2010 demonstrated the maximum rate of permeation of\u000d\u000ahydrogen from an onboard storage tank is sufficiently low, such that there is no flammable mixture\u000d\u000aformed, even on the tank surface. Together with partners Volvo (Sweden), CEA (France) and\u000d\u000aNSRCD (Greece) a safe permeation rate limit of 6.0 Ncm3 of hydrogen per hour per litre of\u000d\u000acontainer internal volume was established (ref 3.3). This rate limit was adopted into European\u000d\u000aRegulation No.406\/2010 as outlined in Section 4 (sources 5.1 and 5.2).\u000d\u000aThe release of hydrogen in the form of a jet is the start of most accidents and is usually followed by\u000d\u000ajet fire and\/or explosion. The ability to predict the behaviour of unignited and ignited jets (fires) is\u000d\u000afundamental for calculating separation distances. Typically hydrogen releases occur from high\u000d\u000apressure meaning the jet is \"under-expanded\", thus it is important to understand how an under-\u000d\u000aexpanded jet behaves. In 2008 Molkov, Makarov and Bragin (researcher\/lecturer 2006-2012)\u000d\u000adeveloped an original \"under-expanded jet theory\" which accounted for flow losses and hydrogen's\u000d\u000anon-ideal behaviour at high pressures. This theory enabled conditions at the jet exit to be\u000d\u000acalculated. In 2010, Molkov and Saffers validated the similarity law for concentration decay in\u000d\u000aunder-expanded jets. This meant the similarity law could be used as a means of calculating\u000d\u000aseparation distances for unignited jets. Hydrogen's buoyancy impacts on separation distances as a\u000d\u000ahorizontal jet will begin to rise as it loses momentum. Thus separation distances can be\u000d\u000asignificantly reduced using the correlation for momentum-to-buoyancy-controlled flow transition in\u000d\u000anon-reacting\/reacting jets. Initial work on jet fires was reflected in the HYPER guidance (grant 3d)\u000d\u000aand the novel jet flame length correlation developed by Molkov\/Saffers has become the\u000d\u000acornerstone for hydrogen safety engineering (refs 3.3 and 3.4).\u000d\u000aPressure relief devices (PRD) are mandatory for hydrogen onboard storage, they enable a gas\u000d\u000atank to empty in the event of fire, preventing catastrophic failure. HySAFER has developed\u000d\u000ainnovative designs to reduce the jet length from a PRD as demonstrated by the underpinning work\u000d\u000aon under-expanded plane jet behaviour (ref 3.5).\u000d\u000aIn 2010 Brennan (researcher 2007-2008, lecturer since 2008), Molkov and Makarov discovered the\u000d\u000apressure peaking phenomenon for unignited indoor releases of hydrogen, and drastically changed\u000d\u000athe requirements for engineering calculations of ventilation system parameters. The research\u000d\u000ademonstrated that a release indoors can lead to overpressures capable of compromising the\u000d\u000aintegrity of a structure (ref 3.6) and thus pressure peaking phenomenon should be accounted for in\u000d\u000adesign. In addition, this work and that on PRDs highlighted the need for improved ventilation\u000d\u000asystems, PRD design, and increased fire resistance of hydrogen storage tanks (grants 3e, 3f and\u000d\u000a3g).\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"60","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe underpinning research through interaction with policy makers and practitioners has raised the\u000d\u000aprofile of regeneration internationally and in the UK across government (DCLG, devolved\u000d\u000aadministrations), investment fund managers, advisers and investors. Research funded by\u000d\u000aESRC\/ODPM\/RICS in developing the first UK property regeneration index has proven to be the\u000d\u000acatalyst for the change in sentiment towards investment in areas undergoing regeneration. The\u000d\u000arecognised importance of the `pilot' index developed by the research team at Ulster and the\u000d\u000asignificance placed on this research by government and industry is encapsulated by the\u000d\u000asubsequent initiation and production of the UK Urban Regeneration Property Index by the\u000d\u000aInvestment Property Databank (IPD). The chairman of the Regeneration Index Committee\u000d\u000aresponsible for production of the UK index offers testament to the pioneering role of the research at\u000d\u000aUlster in `paving the way' for the development of the IPD regeneration index (corroborating\u000d\u000astatement 1, source 5.1). A written response (June 2011) submitted by Igloo Regeneration to the\u000d\u000aDCLG Regeneration Select Committee details the role of the research team at Ulster in developing\u000d\u000athe evidence base that changed regeneration investment decision making (source 5.2). The\u000d\u000aimportance of the regeneration index in offering a robust and credible evidence base of risk-return\u000d\u000aperformance of regeneration areas has been articulated by the Homes and Communities Agency\u000d\u000a(http:\/\/www.homesandcommunities.co.uk\/news\/regeneration-investment-demonstrates-surprising-\u000d\u000aresilience-according-ipd).\u000d\u000aFurther evidence of the significance of the research, its recurring influence on policy development\u000d\u000aand reach is evident across the REF cycle. The 2010 DCLG report entitled `Valuing the Benefits of\u000d\u000aRegeneration &#8212; Logic Chains and Literature Review' incorporates findings from two of the studies\u000d\u000aundertaken by Ulster reiterating the leading role of the research in initiating and establishing\u000d\u000aperformance benchmarking within regeneration property markets (source 5.3). In 2011 the Scottish\u000d\u000aGovernment Social Research report entitled `Town Centre Regeneration: How does it work and\u000d\u000awhat can be achieved' utilised the underpinning research at Ulster to inform policy making on\u000d\u000ainvestment performance in relation to town centre regeneration (source 5.4). Internationally, the\u000d\u000aJohannesburg Development Agency (February 2009) made sustained reference to and adopted\u000d\u000athe research undertaken at Ulster in analysing area based regeneration initiatives to inform policy\u000d\u000adevelopment (source 5.5).\u000d\u000aThe research on BIDs at Ulster, including the annual Nationwide BIDs Survey, has been\u000d\u000ainstrumental in shaping best practice with findings adopted by policy makers and BID companies\u000d\u000arespectively. Impact has been significant in relation to the activities of BID companies but the reach\u000d\u000ahas been wider, with beneficiaries including policy makers, retailers, city councils, town centre\u000d\u000amanagement companies, the Inter Bank Rating Forum, the British Retail Consortium and the\u000d\u000aBritish Council of Shopping Centres (corroborating statement 2, source 5.6). On the policy side,\u000d\u000aevidence presented to the Welsh Assembly Enterprise and Business Committee articulated the\u000d\u000arole of the survey in relation to the operational performance of BIDs. In Notheren Ireland , research\u000d\u000aundertaken for Belfast City Council on BIDs was referenced in the subsequent NI Assembly Social\u000d\u000aDevelopment Committee research paper and informed the August 2012 publication of the\u000d\u000aAssembly Business Improvement Districts Bill. The research team were invited in November 2012\u000d\u000ato present the findings from the 2012 Nationwide BIDs survey to the NI Assembly Committee for\u000d\u000aSocial Development (source 5.7) in their scrutiny of the draft legislation for NI. The evidence\u000d\u000aprovided was considered to be objective, quantitative and based on real examples, it helped the\u000d\u000aCommittee to clarify a number of issues, alleviated concerns the Committee had about a\u000d\u000amandatory levy being imposed under the prevailing economic circumstances and led to the\u000d\u000aCommittee supporting the provisions of the Bill (corroborating statement 3, source 5.8).\u000d\u000aThe investment vehicle strand of the underpinning research has influenced international policy in\u000d\u000arespect of regeneration and essential infrastructure provision. Specifically, the significance of the\u000d\u000aRICS commissioned research on PPP and PFI disseminated at launch events (2011) in Dehli,\u000d\u000aLondon and Washington is reflected through its reach across policy makers, investors, contractors,\u000d\u000aadvisory groups and end users (corroborating statement 4, source 5.9). Subsequent input to the\u000d\u000apolicy agenda in the UK was facilitated through meetings with the Government's Property Unit, the\u000d\u000ahead of PPP policy at Infrastructure UK and HM Treasury. This culminated in a formal approach\u000d\u000afrom HM Treasury to the RICS requesting their insight and understanding to the `call for evidence'\u000d\u000apertaining to the reform of PFI. The RICS response extensively utilised and referenced the\u000d\u000aresearch at Ulster. Pertinently, the HM Treasury publication `A New Approach to Public Private\u000d\u000aPartnerships' (December 2012) advocates four key strands of the guidance and direction\u000d\u000acontained within the RICS submission and directly related to the underpinning research namely\u000d\u000acontract standardisation, contract flexibility, more effective awareness, management on the part of\u000d\u000athe client and reduced procurement timeframes. In the Americas, the research has had particular\u000d\u000aresonance, the depth of its reach and influence on the policy agenda is evidenced by a series of\u000d\u000ahigh profile roundtable and cross-stakeholder discussions (corroborating statement 5, source 5.10)\u000d\u000aincluding the initiation of collaboration between the research team and the Canadian Council for\u000d\u000aPublic Private Partnerships on the development of best practice. The global significance and reach\u000d\u000aof the research is further demonstrated by a presentation to the Vice-Governor of Sao Paulo by the\u000d\u000aRICS Chief Executive as part of the UK trade and investment mission to Brazil in 2012 with the\u000d\u000aPPP report forming the basis of discussions on infrastructure procurement and delivery.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis case study details the research undertaken in the Built Environment Research Institute\u000d\u000a(BERI), Centre for Research on Property and Planning concerning the interrelationships across\u000d\u000aregeneration, value creation and innovative funding mechanisms.

The research raised significant\u000d\u000aquestions in government and the private sector about the nature of risks and returns in\u000d\u000aregeneration. The outcome of this study was utilised by the Urban Task Force, with the then Office\u000d\u000aof Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) subsequently commissioning the same team in 2000 to produce\u000d\u000aa report on factors affecting the level and form of private investment in regeneration. The\u000d\u000apositioning of urban regeneration and whether investment opportunities still existed within the\u000d\u000asector in the wake of the downturn (2008-2009) was the subject of research commissioned by IPF\u000d\u000a(Adair, Berry, Haran and McGreal) and the performance of regeneration property in a mixed-asset\u000d\u000aportfolio formed the basis of the 2011 publication by Haran et al (ref 3.1).\u000d\u000aThe second strand, benchmarking regeneration performance (grant 3b) was facilitated by joint\u000d\u000afunding (2001-2003) through the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) with ODPM and\u000d\u000aRICS to an Ulster led team (Adair, Berry and McGreal) with the universities of Glasgow and\u000d\u000aAberdeen. This research sought to take the outcomes of the JRF study further by addressing how\u000d\u000aproperty performance returns in regeneration areas compared with prime markets. This ground-breaking\u000d\u000apiece of research (the first rigorous analysis of regeneration returns and risks), launched\u000d\u000aat the Tate Gallery by the then minister (Cooper) formed the basis for the later adoption of the\u000d\u000aindex by industry (ref 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4).\u000d\u000aThe third strand, tax incentives in regeneration originated with an ESRC grant (1999-2001) (Berry\u000d\u000aand McGreal with Lloyd then University of Dundee) on tax-based mechanisms in regeneration,\u000d\u000afocussing on Tax Incremental Financing (TIFs) and Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) (ref\u000d\u000a3.5). The theme of tax based mechanisms in a policy context resulted in two significant studies\u000d\u000a(Adair, Berry, McGreal and Allen (Research Associate 2005-2007) funded by HMRC\/DCLG. The\u000d\u000afirst (2004-05) a longitudinal evaluation of the 2001 Urban White Paper Fiscal Measures (grant 3c,\u000d\u000awith Arup and phase 1 with Sheffield Hallam University), and the second (2007) a study into the\u000d\u000aextension of fiscal measures to business premises through the Business Premises Renovation\u000d\u000aAllowance in disadvantaged areas. Further research on BIDs, evolved from the ESRC grant on tax\u000d\u000aincentives with firstly a local, Belfast City Council, funded study (2006-2007) followed by a major\u000d\u000aand on-going UK national study with BritishBIDs (Bb) which commenced in 2009, with subsequent\u000d\u000aannual reports (Adair, Berry, Haran, Hemphill (Lecturer in post since 2007), Kashyap, McCord,\u000d\u000aMcGreal and Mcllhatton &#8212; Research Associate in post since 2009).\u000d\u000aThe fourth strand, on delivery vehicles spanning the different phases of regeneration and\u000d\u000ainfrastructure was funded by the IPF Educational Trust (grant 3d) with English Partnerships and\u000d\u000athe British Property Federation to an Ulster led team (Adair, Allen, Berry, McGreal) with the\u000d\u000aUniversity of Aberdeen. Furthermore, Adair, Berry and McGreal (with Haran, McCord, Kashyap\u000d\u000aand Hutchison University of Aberdeen), funded by RICS (grant 3e), undertook an evaluation of\u000d\u000aPublic Private Partnerships, phase one (2010-2011) focussing on the future of the Private Finance\u000d\u000aInitiative (ref 3.6) and phase two (2012-2013) on value for money and private sector investment.\u000d\u000aThe potential for TIFs as a delivery vehicle (2011-2012), a University of Aberdeen led project with\u000d\u000aUlster, funded by the RICS Education Trust, provides an integrating link to the earlier ESRC study\u000d\u000ain 1999-2001, outlined in strand three, which first explored the potential for TIFs in the UK.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"61","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe impact of the underpinning research on cellular beams is apparent in the construction sector.\u000d\u000aSignificance is in terms of the development of a new design concept applicable in all European\u000d\u000acountries, influencing regulations concerning the sustainability of buildings and cost savings in\u000d\u000arelation to fire protection. Reach extends beyond industry and the construction profession with\u000d\u000abenefits to wider society in terms of safer building structures in the event of fire.\u000d\u000aContribution to the regulatory environment is evidenced in two principal ways namely development\u000d\u000aof the European Fire Design Guidance and improvement to the British Standards BS476: Part 20-\u000d\u000a22 and BS5950 Part 8: Fire Design. Concerning European Design Guidance, the underpinning\u000d\u000aresearch, in particular the results from the major fire test (February 2010) and findings from the fire\u000d\u000aresistance of long span cellular beams project have directly led to the development of a new\u000d\u000adesign code for single cellular beams submitted to fire and extended design guidance concerning\u000d\u000athe whole floor structure (http:\/\/bookshop.europa.eu\/en\/fire-resistance-of-long-span-cellular-beam-\u000d\u000amade-of-rolled-profiles-ficeb--pbKINA25122\/?CatalogCategoryID=w2wKABst3XAAAAEjfJEY4e5L).\u000d\u000aThe significance of the design guidance to industry is highlighted by Arcelor Mittal (corroborating\u000d\u000astatement 1, source 5.1) with this company confirming benefits in relation to fire protection and\u000d\u000amore economic designs. Likewise, the findings of the research are directly applicable to\u000d\u000amanufacturers. For example, ASD Westok identified the impact upon market share and cost\u000d\u000asavings to the company (corroborating statement 2, source 5.2) while Kingfell (corroborating\u000d\u000astatement 3, source 5.3) has indicated improvement of the structural performance in fire.\u000d\u000aReach is extensive, key beneficiaries of the guidance stemming from the underpinning research\u000d\u000aare structural designers using performance based fire design criteria, regulatory authorities at a UK\u000d\u000aand European level, fire-fighters and the general public who will benefit from safer structures and\u000d\u000abuildings. The significance of the New European Fire Design Guidance,\u000d\u000a(http:\/\/www.ife.org.uk\/about\/events) Innovative Construction Design for Fire Safety Engineering is\u000d\u000aemphasised through the development of a European Training Course sponsored by CEC Coal and\u000d\u000aSteel and supported by the Institution of Fire Engineers and industrial partners. Such proactive\u000d\u000adissemination of the Guidance has successfully extended reach to constituent groups. For\u000d\u000aexample, RPS Group (corroborating statement 4, source 5.4) provides evidence of the training\u000d\u000aaspect of the impact and highlights the significance of the workshop sponsored by the European\u000d\u000aCommission as part of the underpinning research in the grant MACS+: Membrane action in fire\u000d\u000adesign of composite slab with solid and cellular steel beams (research grant 3c).\u000d\u000aFurther illustration of the benefit of the underpinning research to the construction sector is the\u000d\u000afindings from the EPSRC grant (grant 3b) concerning the specific impact of the restraint effect on\u000d\u000asurrounding structural elements during a fire compartmentation. This issue has become a major\u000d\u000aconcern for buildings after 9\/11 in which the restraint effect and fire severity ultimately led to the\u000d\u000acollapse of the World Trade Center Buildings in New York. The research findings from this grant\u000d\u000ahave shown how building collapse can be avoided by taking into consideration the axial effect (the\u000d\u000aadditional forces transferred from the cold surrounding structural elements to the element under\u000d\u000afire) at the fire design stage and thereby having more robust structures. Significance arises from\u000d\u000areduction in the cost of damages and reach relates to societal benefit across a range of stake-\u000d\u000aholders by improving safety to occupants\/users in the event of fire occurring\u000d\u000a(http:\/\/www.westok.co.uk). As a consequence of the research (notably references 3.1 - 3.3, grants\u000d\u000a3a and 3b) the prescriptive \"rule\" specified in BS5950 Part 8:1990 for beams with web openings\u000d\u000arequiring 20% extra coating thickness, compared with solid-web beams, was withdrawn from the\u000d\u000aSteel Construction Institute (SCI) approved document AD269. This significant change in the British\u000d\u000aStandard has been verified by the Steel Construction Institute (corroborating statement 5, source\u000d\u000a5.5).\u000d\u000aThe benefits flowing from the new design guidance, developed from the underpinning research, is\u000d\u000ato ensure maximum operational use with regard to the life expectancy of the structure, irrespective\u000d\u000aof the building layout. Furthermore, the analytical techniques developed by FireSERT have been\u000d\u000autilised at an international level as evidenced by Kingfell (corroborating statement 3, source 5.3)\u000d\u000aand Beyond Fire (source 5.6) in regard to best practice. Commercially there has been benefit to\u000d\u000along span construction and an increased market share of steel beams. As an illustration of the\u000d\u000acommercial benefit, ASD Westok suggests a cost saving of circa &#163;3 to 5 million per annum\u000d\u000a(corroborating statement 2, source 5.2). The significance extends beyond cost. For example, when\u000d\u000acellular steel beams are used in multi-storey buildings the reduction in the total weight of the\u000d\u000asteelwork has the benefit of decreasing the depth of floors required to accommodate pipes,\u000d\u000aconduits and ducting thereby yielding significant benefit to the construction sector regarding the\u000d\u000adevelopment of certain multi-storey buildings and the users of these buildings. Details of the\u000d\u000aapplication and benefit of this research on cellular beams to industry has been highlighted on the\u000d\u000aASD Westok web site (http:\/\/www.westok.co.uk) with specific reference to the underpinning\u000d\u000aresearch at FireSERT (source 5.7). Wider community impact and interest is evidenced through\u000d\u000aextensive media reporting of the significance of the research and the safety of buildings in the\u000d\u000aevent of fire (source 5.8).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThe development of standards and design guides at a European level for composite concrete\u000d\u000afloors with cellular steel beams has been informed by research undertaken in the Fire Safety\u000d\u000aEngineering Research and Technology centre (FireSERT), Built Environment Research Institute.\u000d\u000aCentral to the impact is the establishment of technical rules for the fire safe design of buildings\u000d\u000aconstructed with the use of cellular beams.

In particular the research grant \"Performance in\u000d\u000afire of restrained columns in steel framed construction\" (award of &#163;125K, 1996-1999 to O'Connor\u000d\u000a(left University 2001) and Nadjai (in post continuously since 1995 and professor from 2004)) was\u000d\u000athe first substantive research in this area. In 2001, Nadjai advanced this research with further work\u000d\u000aon the development of innovative structural and economic solutions in steel structural elements\u000d\u000aand steel cellular beams in buildings.\u000d\u000aStemming from this body of work, Nadjai with Ali (in post from 1996, professor since 2009)\u000d\u000ahighlighted that the structural fire engineering European design code (prEN1993-1-2\/prEN1994-1-2\u000d\u000aand British Standard BS5950 Part 8) did not contain rules or guidance on the fire resistance of\u000d\u000acomposite floors employing cellular steel beams (http:\/\/www.iom3.org\/news\/cellular-composite-\u000d\u000afloor-beams-fire-high-temperature published by the Materials World Magazine). This gap in the\u000d\u000aknowledge base concerning structural fire design for cellular beams has major implications for the\u000d\u000aconstruction industry and raises issues in relation to not only the use of a specific product but the\u000d\u000awider application of structural steel elements in buildings. Furthermore, in industry there has been\u000d\u000amuch debate concerning the requirements for intumescent coatings. The outcome of this research\u000d\u000ahas been to highlight the need for a uniform European design approach to address the implications\u000d\u000aarising from the gap in the knowledge base.\u000d\u000aResearch over the ensuing ten year period (2001-2011) by Nadjai and colleagues has sought to\u000d\u000aaddress these issues by focussing on the failure mechanism of the fire resistance of long span\u000d\u000acellular beams (grants 3a, 3b, 3c). The first of these research awards (grant 3a) Fire Resistance of\u000d\u000aLong Span Cellular Beams Made of Roller Profiles (FICEB) funded by CEC Research Fund for\u000d\u000aCoal and Steel (total value &#163;1.6M) http:\/\/www.build.ie\/construction_news.asp?newsid=107400\u000d\u000ainvolved the collaboration of major industrial steel manufacturers ASD Westok Ltd (UK) and\u000d\u000aArcelor Mittal (Luxembourg), regulators the Steel Construction Institute (SCI-UK) and the Centre\u000d\u000aTechnique Industrial de la Construction Metallique (CTICM- France) and an academic partner the\u000d\u000aUniversity of Liege. The significance of this research, as discussed in Section 4, was the\u000d\u000adevelopment of standards and design guides, through the establishment of European codes for the\u000d\u000afire safe design of buildings constructed using cellular beams. While grant 3a was concerned with\u000d\u000anatural fire, the second award (grant 3b) considered the fire resistance of cellular beams, both\u000d\u000aprotected and unprotected, in a furnace fire situation. The results from this aspect of the research\u000d\u000ahave informed British standards for cellular beams in relation to the restraint effect (the effect of the\u000d\u000asurrounding elements not subject to fire). The third of these, grant 3c, brought together the\u000d\u000aEuropean codes and British standards regarding resistance of buildings to fire and facilitated\u000d\u000adissemination to key stake-holders.\u000d\u000aA distinct characteristic of the underpinning research has been the ability to complement laboratory\u000d\u000abased research by field testing http:\/\/www.theengineer.co.uk\/Articles\/301348\/Fiery+research.htm.\u000d\u000aInnovation is evident in the conducting, by a research team led by Nadjai in February 2010, of a\u000d\u000alarge real scale 3D compartment fire test for a typical office construction (references 3.1, 3.2 and\u000d\u000a3.3). The tests were designed to investigate the failure mechanism of long cellular beams, the\u000d\u000amembrane actions of composite structures and to propose robust design solutions. The scale of\u000d\u000athe fire test was unique with an invited international audience of scientists and companies\u000d\u000asponsoring the event (http:\/\/www.firesert.ulster.ac.uk\/FSIW\/pdf\/final-programme.pdf).\u000d\u000aThe underpinning research on concrete and steel beams and columns by Nadjai and colleagues in\u000d\u000aFireSERT (references 3.4 - 3.6, grant 3d) has resulted in extensive international collaboration, one\u000d\u000aexample being that with the Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy (grant 3e) in a research\u000d\u000aproject on the investigation of fire protection requirements which currently do not exist in Korean\u000d\u000aregulation (Choi lecturer in post since 2008 with Nadjai).The outcome of this research is providing\u000d\u000aa set of practical design recommendations to satisfy the requirements of fire safe engineering,\u000d\u000atransferring knowledge from Ulster with specific application in Korea.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"85","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThis case study presents examples of how research into underappreciated architects and their\u000d\u000abuildings has resulted in wide-ranging impacts, including enhancing public understanding and\u000d\u000ainforming practical decisions by professionals, activists and public bodies responsible for\u000d\u000aevaluating and protecting historic architecture.\u000d\u000a1 REACH: the diffusion of the findings through research to new audiences:\u000d\u000aEffective audience development in this field relies on a long period of gestation before impact can\u000d\u000abe claimed, since amenity societies and public agencies take into account demonstrable public\u000d\u000ainterest over a period of time when taking decisions. Brittain-Catlin is one of Britain's most widely\u000d\u000apublished architectural commentators. He has been reviewing and writing continuously for The\u000d\u000aWorld of Interiors (monthly, readership estimated at 161,000 worldwide) since 1989. He\u000d\u000aoccasionally writes for The Tablet, a literary weekly with an average circulation of about 20,000;\u000d\u000aand for Architecture Today and Architectural Review, the readers of which (just under 20,000, and\u000d\u000a12,807 respectively) are mainly architects, regularly bringing his research insights to a professional\u000d\u000aaudience outside academia. His general readership books How to Read a Building (2007),\u000d\u000aChurches (2008), and Architecture (2008) have enabled the promotion of a new interpretation of\u000d\u000aAWN Pugin, the C19 gothic revival and parsonage building to a growing general audience. These\u000d\u000abooks are widely loaned by libraries (7,538 loans, June 2008-June 2012 (latest figures available)).\u000d\u000aFollowing his earlier contribution to the narrative of the Channel 4 programme `Time Team' on\u000d\u000aPugin's house in Ramsgate (about 2M viewers and frequently repeated since 2008), he contributed\u000d\u000asubstantially in this REF period to a BBC4 documentary on Pugin celebrating his bicentenary\u000d\u000a(2012) which has been repeated many times. In the producer's words, the programme `wouldn't\u000d\u000ahave had such an impact but for your excellent contributions' [letter from corroboration 5.1 below].\u000d\u000a2 REACH: the development of a new critical audience among influential members of the\u000d\u000ageneral public, generally through impact on amenity societies\u000d\u000aResearch on parsonages, Field and Manasseh has been and will be incorporated into large-\u000d\u000acirculation, authoritative guides such as The Buildings of England (Yale UP; several counties, since\u000d\u000a2006; most recently, East Sussex and North and North East Kent (both 2013)) and elsewhere, with\u000d\u000aexplicit acknowledgment [see letter from Yale UP, 5.5]. Leonard Manasseh (see below) will feature\u000d\u000ain the next edition of the authoritative Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\u000d\u000aas a result of Brittain-Catlin's work, and he was formally consulted by OUP regarding plans for\u000d\u000achanging the current content and scope of this important reference work.\u000d\u000aThrough his work with professional bodies and amenity societies Brittain-Catlin has significantly\u000d\u000aimproved understanding and appreciation of Victorian and gothic revival architecture and led a re-\u000d\u000aevaluation of key examples. He was for eight years (until 2012) editor of the Pugin Society's journal\u000d\u000aand active member of its committee. The Society has about 400 members internationally, and is\u000d\u000acontinuously growing. It disseminates new research about the Pugin family to a wide audience\u000d\u000a[3.6] which contains many members who are influential opinion formers (such as politicians, artists\u000d\u000ain other fields, and many people active in building conservation as practitioners as well as writers\u000d\u000aand polemicists). He has been a member of the Southern Buildings Committee of the Victorian\u000d\u000aSociety since 2001 [5.2]. This committee is one of two which in effect act as the executive\u000d\u000acommittee of the Society, determining both in general and in detail the policy of the Society\u000d\u000aregarding alterations to Victorian buildings. The Society is a statutory consultee, and local planning\u000d\u000aauthorities are expected to submit significant proposals to it. Examples of continuing and long-term\u000d\u000aimpact on committee decisions have related to development at a series of Pugin houses: The\u000d\u000aGrange, Ramsgate; the former rectory, Rampisham (upgraded in 2006 to Grade 1 as a result of\u000d\u000aBrittain-Catlin's research); and Oswaldcroft, Liverpool, during the current period (see below).\u000d\u000aThe key insights from Brittain-Catlin's continuing research into the early gothic revival have been\u000d\u000afrequently presented by him to general audiences drawn from the membership of amenity and\u000d\u000asimilar societies, including the Dundee Conservation Lectures held in 2010 and 2011; the\u000d\u000aVernacular Architecture Group (2009); the Essex Historic Buildings Group (2012) [5.6]; the Norfolk\u000d\u000aHistoric Buildings Group (2012); the Friends of St Augustine's Church, Ramsgate (2012); the\u000d\u000aCharing and District Local History Society (2013); the (national) Art Fund (2012), and others.\u000d\u000aThese talks are generally followed by an article in a society's newsletter which then reaches all\u000d\u000amembers. The researcher has received many letters from local history or architectural enthusiasts\u000d\u000ainspired by The English Parsonage to carry out related researches in their own area.\u000d\u000a3 SIGNIFICANCE: the creation of impact on local communities, through the exploitation of\u000d\u000aacademic research in local sites of heritage significance\u000d\u000aBrittain-Catlin has acted as a specialist consultant to local planning authorities and developers and\u000d\u000ahas directly influenced decisions on the preservation of a number of significant buildings; and,\u000d\u000asecondly, he organised a conference with demonstrable local social, cultural and economic impact.\u000d\u000aResearch into both early C19 and mid-C20 architecture has resulted in Brittain-Catlin providing\u000d\u000aadvice in response to requests from local planning authorities. Examples include work for Kirklees\u000d\u000aCouncil, which wrote that his research was `of significant use' in determining an application to\u000d\u000ademolish a vicarage at Paddock, near Huddersfield [5.7]. In the case of the Pugin house\u000d\u000a`Oswaldcroft', the Victorian Society's official response to an original listed building application was\u000d\u000abased directly on Brittain-Catlin's detailed case; the local conservation officer then suggested to a\u000d\u000asubsequent developer that Brittain-Catlin should prepare the Statement of Historical Asset\u000d\u000aSignificance for a subsequent application. This he did, resulting in the granting of listed building\u000d\u000aconsent [5.3]. The project architect commented that `it is without question that had we not had the\u000d\u000aknowledge and research prepared by Mr Timothy Brittain-Catlin, then our client's planning\u000d\u000aapplication would have struggled to obtain local authority approval including English Heritage' [5.3].\u000d\u000aBrittain-Catlin is an active trustee and publications committee chair of the Twentieth Century\u000d\u000aSociety (C20S), which supported his case for the listing of Leonard Manasseh buildings in London\u000d\u000a[5.4; 5.10]. Other listing applications have since been initiated through C20S on the basis of his\u000d\u000aresearch. The Designations Director of English Heritage has written confirming the important role\u000d\u000aof the C20S \/ EH \/ RIBA series, to which both Brittain-Catlin and Adler contributed during the REF\u000d\u000aperiod, in `the delivery of protection through listing, through informing planning decisions, and by\u000d\u000aengaging owners and their agents in better appreciating their property. We have directly drawn on\u000d\u000athese titles in preparing listing recommendations for DCMS, and they contribute directly into our\u000d\u000athematic assessment approach' [5.10]. Similarly, The Victorian Society has sought the listing of\u000d\u000abuildings designed by Horace Field on the basis of Brittain-Catlin 's published research [3.3, 3.5]\u000d\u000a[5.2]: The C20S will likewise seek listing for the work of Edgar Ranger, currently being researched.\u000d\u000aAs a trustee of the C20S, the researcher was an active member of a body consulted by the\u000d\u000aDepartment of Culture, Media and Sport regarding their Improving Listed Building Consent (2012).\u000d\u000aThe conference `New Directions in Gothic Revival Studies Worldwide' (Canterbury, July 2012),\u000d\u000ademonstrates the route to research impact: the researcher's status, based on his publications\u000d\u000a[eg, 3.1, 3.2, 3.6] enabled him to convene a major international conference, and he devised a\u000d\u000aprogramme with broad impact potential. Events were held in Ramsgate, open to all, in which\u000d\u000aanyone with an interest in local architecture could meet the worldwide leaders of gothic revival\u000d\u000ascholarship; and Pugin Society members could attend the conference for a very much reduced\u000d\u000arate. Conference events included talks that were accessible for a non-academic audience, drawn\u000d\u000aby the researcher's general readership books. Events were reported in the local press, and in the\u000d\u000aArchitectural Review (international professional readership). Brittain-Catlin spoke on BBC Kent\u000d\u000a(12.7.12). Following his initiative with Thanet District Council, academic speakers at the conference\u000d\u000awere transported free in evenings and mornings between the conference site and Ramsgate in\u000d\u000aorder to support local bed &amp; breakfast owners and contribute to the local economy. The conference\u000d\u000aalso introduced conference speakers to the Ramsgate Society, a local amenity society, by\u000d\u000aorganising tours of the town. Thanet District Council's tourist manager Paula Harbidge commented\u000d\u000a`Such events are wonderful for the local economy and they also enhance the area's reputation -\u000d\u000anationally and internationally', (reported in Thanet Extra, 11.7.2012, p 2 [5.9]). These events are an\u000d\u000aexample of successful strategic impact planning and provide a model for a type of future activity.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis case study demonstrates how Timothy Brittain-Catlin's long-term research into a group of\u000d\u000ahistoric buildings sharing a common theme, and designed by underappreciated architects, has had\u000d\u000awide-ranging impacts on various groups.

Key insights deriving from\u000d\u000aresearch, which have developed and guided impact, include:\u000d\u000a1) the long-term cultural value of some architects' work has been undermined by the traditional\u000d\u000amethodologies of architectural history and are underprotected statutorily.\u000d\u000a2) some significant sources of research have up to now been missed by researchers (for\u000d\u000aexample, the parsonage mortgage files in diocesan archives, and personal archives held by some\u000d\u000atwentieth-century architects).\u000d\u000a3) the value of aspects of architectural practice change at certain historical periods, so that\u000d\u000ahidden qualities can be appreciated best by later audiences.\u000d\u000aThe research was undertaken mainly in the form of archival and site research. Research for The\u000d\u000aEnglish Parsonage in the Early Nineteenth Century [ref 3.1], completed during 2008, consisted of\u000d\u000afinding, reviewing and analysing drawings and documents relating to parsonage mortgage\u000d\u000aapplications made by incumbents in the Church of England to church mortgage givers. This\u000d\u000aprocess revealed how the gothic revival spread across English domestic architecture and how\u000d\u000asome architects faced loss of reputation, a phenomenon subsequently developed by Brittain-Catlin\u000d\u000ain his role as editor of the peer-review journal of The Pugin Society [3.6].\u000d\u000aA second phase of research was carried out during 2008-09 and consisted mainly of reviewing\u000d\u000amaterial in the Lloyds Banking Group Archives. This material related to the career of Horace Field\u000d\u000aas architect of a series of influential bank branches. The course of Field's career, and especially its\u000d\u000adownward trajectory, was then described in `Horace Field and Lloyds Bank', a detailed account of\u000d\u000aField's work for the bank that was published in Architectural History in 2010 [3.3]; and `Downward\u000d\u000atrajectory: towards a theory of failure' (ARQ, 2011) [3.5], which uses the overall pattern of Field's\u000d\u000acareer, beyond his bank work, as a way of suggesting alternative interpretations of `unsuccessful'\u000d\u000aarchitects. During 2009-10 Brittain-Catlin concentrated on the career of the British post-Second\u000d\u000aWorld War modernist architects Leonard Manasseh &amp; Partners, specifically for a book in the RIBA \/\u000d\u000aEnglish Heritage \/ Twentieth Century Society series on modern British architects [3.4, 5.10], but\u000d\u000aalso to see how historical patterns in architects' professional reputations continue up to the present\u000d\u000aday. There was no conventional surviving archive for these architects, and Brittain-Catlin's\u000d\u000aresearch took the form of amassing material from private collections, from interviews, and from\u000d\u000avisits to various sources. Brittain-Catlin's current research focuses on the interwar Thanet architect\u000d\u000aEdgar Ranger, and he has recently completed a book on the subject of undervalued architects, to\u000d\u000abe published by The MIT Press in March 2014.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"100","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"286963","Name":"Oman"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The historical, cultural, methodological and ethical insights from the\u000a      research and outputs\u000a      have resulted in pioneering, wide-ranging and sustained impact from NTU's\u000a      leading involvement\u000a      and advisory role in a number of impactful projects in the documentation,\u000a      management and\u000a      renewal of built heritage in Oman\u000a      and the UAE\u000a      and its dissemination through public engagement.\u000a    Oman: In 2010, aware of the gap in management of heritage sites,\u000a      Oman's Ministry of\u000a      Heritage and Culture (MHC) decided to select a partner to address its\u000a      cultural heritage sites at\u000a      greatest risk. Based on NTU's research and advisory record in this field,\u000a      our team was invited.\u000a      Stage-1 of the initiative involved a pilot-study to undertake\u000a      documentation and Heritage\u000a      Management Plan (HMP) for 2 oasis settlements (Birkat al-Mawz-WHS and\u000a      Izki-selective; grant-i;\u000a      evidence-4) on their priority list of 86, followed by 4 more in Stage-2\u000a      (completed July 2013) and 4\u000a      in Stage-3 (on-going).\u000a    Stage-1: Contextually-appropriate, cost-effective and expedient\u000a      alternatives to established\u000a      documentation methods (e.g. resource-intensive ICOMOS - International\u000a      Council on Monuments\u000a      and Sites - approach) were developed by NTU, by limiting the on-site\u000a      component and emphasising\u000a      aerial-photograph-based documentation. Comprehensive and selective\u000a      documentation approaches\u000a      were applied to HMPs and compared to ascertain their relative benefits in\u000a      documenting Oman's\u000a      1000-plus vernacular settlements.\u000a    Key feature of this pilot-HMP - well-received by MHC and the Committee\u000a      for the\u000a      Registration and Protection of Historic Building Clusters - is its focus\u000a      on future generations through\u000a      full integration of developmental needs\/aspirations in renewal\u000a      (training\/education\/crafts\/renewable\u000a      energy). This model combines heritage management and development in a\u000a      Master Plan and\u000a      employs comprehensive documentation (instead of conventional selective\u000a      approach in WHSs.\u000a    Stage-2: Following success of the pilot phase, MHC asked NTU to\u000a      undertake work on 4\u000a      additional settlements (Izki, Ibri, Bahla-WHS, Fanja; grant-g;\u000a      evidence-1-3) in the Dakhiliyah\u000a      (Interior) Governorate. MHC embraced the documentation approaches as\u000a      `models' and has\u000a      adopted the comprehensive option for future key settlement HMPs\u000a      (undertaken by NTU) and the\u000a      selective option for small-settlement documentation (by Salut Planning and\u000a      Management,\u000a      advised\/reviewed by NTU). MHC has acted on NTU's advice and is currently\u000a      reviewing the\u000a      inventory of vernacular settlements to establish a rigorous criteria-based\u000a      priority list (evidence-5).\u000a      NTU has contributed text and non-text based material on vernacular\u000a      architecture for the permanent\u000a      display at Muscat's National Museum (grant-f).\u000a    Stage-3: In 2013 NTU was awarded 4 new sites (2 in Sinaw, Mudayrib\u000a      and Al-Gila-WHS;\u000a      new funding &#163;161,000) in the unexplored Sharqiyyah (Eastern) Governorate.\u000a      Full implementation\u000a      of Master Plans are being discussed with MHC for Salalah and with Ministry\u000a      of Tourism for Misfat\u000a      Al-`Abriyeen and Minzafah.\u000a    Capacity Building Element: In 2009 the NTU team was invited by\u000a      Muscat Municipality to\u000a      undertake vernacular settlement documentation within Muscat Governorate\u000a      (grant-h). To train\u000a      young Omanis in heritage documentation, the project was developed with a\u000a      significant 'capacity\u000a      building' component (an approach subsequently adopted by MHC for its\u000a      employees - 20 trained;\u000a      evidence-6). Twelve unemployed graduates (6 men\/6 women) from the Oman\u000a      Technical College\u000a      were recruited on the documentation training programme through interviews\u000a      (evidence-7).\u000a      Intensive on-site training supported by NTU-developed training manual\u000a      prepared the\u000a      documentation team with the requisite documentation, representation, team\u000a      working, project\u000a      management and leadership skills.

Following the eight-month fieldwork and drawn documentation\u000a      production, all trainees\u000a      gained employment within government and private sectors with average\u000a      annual salaries of\u000a      &#163;18,000, indicating economic and social impact.

Shackley's internationally recognised work (1998:\u000a      reference-1; also 2001 &amp; 2002) on\u000a      the complex cultural and political nature of World-Heritage-Sites (WHS) as\u000a      places of tourism and\u000a      the validity of applying contemporary theoretical frameworks to analysing\u000a      historical issues had\u000a      provided important insights into their management and consumption.\u000a      Paralleling this, Mansfield's\u000a      work in heritage focused on conservation and protection policies, their\u000a      remit within the UK and the\u000a      legal and ethical challenges. His publication in Structural Survey\u000a      (2001) addressed a key issue in\u000a      heritage conservation: refurbishment. Exploring the perception of `risk'\u000a      in refurbishment amongst\u000a      conservation consultants, Mansfield highlighted the importance of the\u000a      clients' awareness of cultural\u000a      issues. In recognising the importance of the design quality Mansfield\u000a      subsequently argued the role\u000a      of government initiatives (CABE) in enshrining good design within\u000a      conservation policy (2004:\u000a      reference-3). The ethical challenges associated with design interventions\u000a      within an increasingly\u000a      complex conservation practice is discussed in Mansfield's 2008 paper.\u000a      Black's work (2002:\u000a      reference-2) on the conservation of built heritage in the UK was\u000a      underpinned by wider multi-\u000a      disciplinary research interest within the institution on the need to\u000a      address the significant built\u000a      heritage in Nottingham - a legacy of the city's lace manufacturing\u000a      industry. The work provided\u000a      important theoretical and practice-related insights into the appreciation,\u000a      interpretation and\u000a      appropriation of built heritage in the UK. A social enterprise based\u000a      approach to heritage\u000a      management emerged in the work of Alina and Tom Hughes, whose concerns\u000a      centred on identity\u000a      and social justice. In 2003, under the Prince of Wales' INTBAU\u000a      (International Network for\u000a      Traditional Building, Architecture and Urbanism) initiative, the team was\u000a      involved in the production\u000a      of a master plan for the medieval Saxon village of Laslea in Transylvania,\u000a      Romania through an\u000a      international development and design workshop (http:\/\/www.intbau.org\/archive\/Transylvania.htm).\u000a    The study of vernacular environments and heritage management were given\u000a      further impetus\u000a      with the arrival of Bandyopadhyay in 2008 through work on oasis\u000a      settlements of Oman. Although\u000a      Bandyopadhyay's early work and some impact activities took place at Liverpool\u000a        University, funding\u000a      bids secured at Liverpool and later at NTU (AHRC, US Ambassador's Fund for\u000a      Cultural\u000a      Preservation, Historical Association of Oman; grant references a-e)\u000a      resulted in important\u000a      publications at NTU. His research on the politico-historical background of\u000a      prayer niches (mihrab)\u000a      and their underlying cultural concepts in central Omani mosques (2008) was\u000a      followed by an\u000a      exhibition on the architecture and settlement organisation of Harat\u000a      al-Bilad, the main settlement in\u000a      the oasis of Manah (2009: reference-4). The exhibition highlighted key\u000a      methodological problems of\u000a      settlement documentation and analysis and emphasised the need to\u000a      understand heritage\u000a      settlements in terms of social and deeper cultural practices and ideals.\u000a      The publication on tribal\u000a      dynamics (2011: reference-5) emphasised the importance of considering the\u000a      complex tribal and\u000a      social history in understanding settlement organisation and evolution in\u000a      central Oman.\u000a      Bandyopadhyay's well-received monograph (2011: reference-6) extended these\u000a      assertions further\u000a      through a detailed study of central Omani oasis settlements, exploring\u000a      notions of sacredness, the\u000a      role of water, mosque and dwelling typology, and settlement morphology,\u000a      amongst other issues.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"580","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research project behind `Petit Bayle' consists not only of the\u000d\u000a      original design for it, but also the construction and continuing\u000d\u000a      experience and use of it.

Smith played an\u000d\u000a      equal part with Victoria Thornton in the original design of the house: see\u000d\u000a      output\u000a        JS1 `Petit Bayle' [5.3].\u000d\u000a    Since 2007 Smith has continuously used Petit Bayle &#8212; its overall concept,\u000d\u000a      its details, and its post-occupancy feedback &#8212; as a basis for teaching in\u000d\u000a      order to maintain a continuous process of research into its function.\u000d\u000a      These aspects of the building were built into project briefs for students\u000d\u000a      at different levels in the school and were discussed through lectures as\u000d\u000a      well as seminars and design projects. This ongoing research continues to\u000d\u000a      play a role in the evaluation of the design for a wider audience.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, during the design and research process Smith has been\u000d\u000a      involved with the work of the School at all levels, which included\u000d\u000a      engagement with its developing interest in sustainable environments; the\u000d\u000a      establishment of CASE, the School's research centre for sustainable\u000d\u000a      environmental design; and in practice also as a tutor to third-year\u000d\u000a      students required to work on environmental and technical solutions for\u000d\u000a      their buildings.\u000d\u000a    Petit Bayle is located in the Lot et Garonne region of South Western\u000d\u000a      France. The process of design and research was underway in 2007 and the\u000d\u000a      house was completed in 2008. The house was designed for the use of a\u000d\u000a      single family as a holiday residence; the area is 170 square metres and\u000d\u000a      the cost of the project was &#8364;290,000.\u000d\u000a    Research methodology and questions for the project are described\u000d\u000a      in detail in\u000d\u000a        the output JS1. The most significant questions were: how can\u000d\u000a      local building materials and forms be incorporated into a sustainable\u000d\u000a      building project in an isolated rural location? How can the requirements\u000d\u000a      and details of sustainable design become part of a coherent architectural\u000d\u000a      language that suits the special location of this house? How can the unique\u000d\u000a      aspects of site and orientation be expressed while meeting the demands of\u000d\u000a      sustainable design? What lessons can be drawn from the design and\u000d\u000a      occupancy of this project for architects operating in similar geographic\u000d\u000a      and climatic situations?\u000d\u000a    Methodology: Using the site and context as a generator of form,\u000d\u000a      function and materiality, the approach was to understand and explore the\u000d\u000a      various architectural possibilities offered by a steeply sloping rural\u000d\u000a      site. The location offered dramatic views of the surrounding landscape and\u000d\u000a      the fundamental aim was the design of a house that would exploit the\u000d\u000a      potential for useful passive solar gain and cooling, alongside an\u000d\u000a      exploration of locally available, affordable and sustainable materials and\u000d\u000a      building techniques. The early design processes were based on recording\u000d\u000a      site experiences and exploring its potential through a quick turnover of\u000d\u000a      ideas, without being overly precious, whilst remaining bound by some\u000d\u000a      awareness of what could be affordable and practical.\u000d\u000a    The key research insights for the project take the form of the\u000d\u000a      eventual architectural solution which has been widely published and\u000d\u000a      continues to be analysed. Smith has defined his areas of enquiry as\u000d\u000a      follows:\u000d\u000a    i) what are the pragmatic and poetic possibilities of a site in a\u000d\u000a      context-based design response?\u000d\u000a    ii) what is the importance of understanding the opportunities and limits\u000d\u000a      offered by the working practices and technologies of a particular place?\u000d\u000a    iii) how does a visceral, haptic experience function as an antidote to\u000d\u000a      the increasingly virtual world of contemporary existence?\u000d\u000a    iv) how do the development of simple, low tech and robust sustainability\u000d\u000a      strategies function as integral parts of the design process, becoming key\u000d\u000a      generators of form and choice of materials rather than the outcome of\u000d\u000a      simple pragmatic and technological developments?\u000d\u000a    Although these are questions without quantifiable answers, close\u000d\u000a      observation of the house during the latter and current stages of the\u000d\u000a      project has demonstrated some valuable responses. There has been\u000d\u000a      continuous monitoring at a practical level, observing which elements need\u000d\u000a      replacement\/ repair; and comparing anticipated robustness (or otherwise)\u000d\u000a      of materials and finishes. Specifically, the strategies to combat-over\u000d\u000a      heating over the summer have been monitored, with better than expected\u000d\u000a      results, although it should be noted that the performance of the house\u000d\u000a      during the unoccupied winter months in terms of energy usage and cost have\u000d\u000a      not yet been methodically tested or monitored. The use of spaces by\u000d\u000a      residents and visitors (including) design professionals has however been\u000d\u000a      monitored and discussed, in particular where this has varied from what was\u000d\u000a      anticipated. Occupation of the project has prolonged the ability to\u000d\u000a      experience and contemplate the building's engagement with the landscape\u000d\u000a      throughout the day, night and the summer months, and to draw conclusions\u000d\u000a      from it.\u000d\u000a    The design for this house forms part of a continuum of research\u000d\u000a      undertaken by Smith, as an independent architect, as a collaborator, and\u000d\u000a      as the lead design architect in earlier employment: all these projects\u000d\u000a      share common ground with the following aspects of the research design\u000d\u000a      process: engagement with context as being the key generator of form by\u000d\u000a      careful consideration of the approach up and into the building;\u000d\u000a      orchestration of routes through the building; and the controlling of views\u000d\u000a      and manipulation of light.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2787","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research has positively impacted the way in which public, private\u000a      and third sectors specifically approach PPP procurement at the following\u000a      levels:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Impact\u000a                level 1:\u000a          \u000aEconomic,\u000a              commercial and organisational - through improving\u000a            processes; increasing effectiveness of practice; and the governance\u000a            of private business entities.\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Impact\u000a                level 2:\u000a          \u000aPublic policy\u000a            - through helping shape public sector PPP procedures, thereby\u000a            improving infrastructure delivery to the benefit of society.\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Impact\u000a                level 3:\u000a          \u000aEnvironment\u000a            - through positive influence on professional practice to inform PPP\u000a            guidelines and shape future service provision.\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    4.1 Evidence\u000a    The above three levels of impact are verified in the following five\u000a      evidence descriptors.

(Impact level 2; Corroborative source 2).\u000a    2) Internationally, CIB TG72 has positively impacted on understanding,\u000a      awareness and the practical application of PPP. For example, in 2009,\u000a      Kumaraswamy and Akintoye led the CIB TG72 Conference, \"Revamping\u000a      PPPs: From `Revisiting and Rethinking' to `Revamping and Revitalising'\u000a      PPPs\".

The project started in 2010, and brought\u000a      together international research partners from 17 European and four\u000a      non-European countries (Australia, Hong Kong, Albania and USA).

The research also identified critical\u000a      success factors such as partners' commitment to adequate resources,\u000a      equitable relationships and recognition of non-financial benefits; while\u000a      principal failure mechanisms were found to include lack of\u000a      trust\/consolation, inexperience and poor business fit. In advancing these\u000a      findings for the benefit of end users, the UoA designed approaches for\u000a      capturing and prioritising collaborative drivers in such areas as:\u000a      relationships, trust, risk allocation, legal and regulatory requirements,\u000a      and market maturity criteria (Adetola et al., 2011).\u000a    Construction Innovation and Process Improvement (Akintoye et\u000a        al., 2012), further complemented and consolidated this research,\u000a      with contributions from esteemed international academics and practitioners\u000a      from Australia, Egypt, Hong Kong, Malaysia, The Netherlands, Turkey, UK,\u000a      and the USA. This peer-reviewed seminal text brought PPP to forefront of\u000a      public and practitioner awareness. In recognition of the UoA's seminal\u000a      work, the CIB Programme Committee established a new Task Group TG72\u000a        Public Private Partnership in 2008, which is led by Akintoye\u000a      and Kumaraswamy. TG72 continues to internationally inform and positively\u000a      impact PPP through this leading forum to facilitate effective\u000a      knowledge-exchange for core PPP issues.\u000a    The UoA's PPP research also informs society through numerous conduits,\u000a      including industry workshops and dedicated conference forums such as\u000a      Constructing Excellence; The International Conference on PPP Body of\u000a      Knowledge, Preston, UK (2013) in collaboration with European Co-\u000a        operation in Science and Technology; CIB TG72; and the University\u000a        of Hong Kong, China. Outreach is also complemented through\u000a      specialist workshops (e.g. Akintoye et al., 2011), and\u000a      cognate outputs (Akintoye et al, 2012; Brown et al.,\u000a      2013) as key components of the impact process.\u000a    1 Accessed at: http:\/\/www.cost.eu\/domains_actions\/tud\/Actions\/TU1001\u000a      (October, 2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2788","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has positively impacted the way in which public, private and\u000a      third sectors view and interact with their natural environment at the\u000a      following levels:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Impact\u000a                level 1:\u000a          \u000aEconomic,\u000a              commercial and organisational &#8212; particularly in the\u000a            organisational context.\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Impact\u000a                level 2:\u000a          \u000aPublic policy\u000a            &#8212; for example, through confirmation by the Environment Minister of\u000a            State [Lord de Mauley] (see Section 5).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Impact\u000a                level 3:\u000a          \u000aEnvironment\u000a            &#8212; via a more positive disposition to the natural environment of the\u000a            public, scientists and other stakeholders.\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Impact\u000a                level 4:\u000a          \u000aPractitioners\u000a              and Professional services &#8212; through resultant changes in\u000a            practice of relevant groups such as teachers, lecturers and\u000a            scientists.\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    4.1 Evidence\u000a    The above four levels of impact are verified in the following six\u000a      evidence descriptors.

The project engaged over 1,000 organisations\u000a      from the voluntary (53%), community (38%) and statutory (9%) sectors in\u000a      designing and delivering natural environment activities. (Impact\u000a          levels 1, 3 and 4; Corroborative sources 1, 2, 6 and 8).\u000a    2) Public policy: has been positively impacted by the project and as a\u000a      result, so has society at large. This was evidenced for instance, by Lord\u000a      de Mauley's presentation at the OPAL report event, which took place at the\u000a      House of Lords on 22nd January 2013. (Impact level 2;\u000a          Corroborative sources 1, 2 and 7).\u000a    3) Societal impact: evidenced in that almost half of OPAL's participants\u000a      when questioned, said that taking part had changed the way they thought\u000a      about the environment. Over one third of participants said that they would\u000a      improve their behaviour towards the environment &#8212; confirming more positive\u000a      environmental attitudes among society as a direct result of this project's\u000a      impact. (Impact levels 2 and 3; Corroborative sources 3, 4, 6, 7\u000a          and 8).\u000a    4) Engagement and outreach: it was found that: i) being able to\u000a      contribute to a national research programme was a key motivating factor\u000a      for many participants; ii) for half of participants this was the first\u000a      time they had engaged in a scientific initiative; and iii) OPAL was\u000a      broadening peoples' natural environment knowledge and skills (90% of\u000a      participants said they had learnt something new). (Impact\u000a          levels 1, 2 and 4; Corroborative sources 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).\u000a    5) Environment: findings identified that individuals' appreciation of\u000a      (and care for) the environment was essential for environmental\u000a      sustainability. OPAL has extended the ways people can achieve this in the\u000a      following ways: i) more than 25,000 sites across England have been studied\u000a      by local people; ii) 230,000 field packs were distributed to schools and\u000a      community groups; iii) over 1,000 training courses were delivered; iv) the\u000a      public surveyed over 25,000 sites across England and entered the\u000a      information into the OPAL national database; v) communities contributed\u000a      data to local research studies; vi) scientists developed strong links with\u000a      local communities, helping the public gain greater understanding of what\u000a      scientists do and the relevance of science to their everyday lives; vii)\u000a      scientists found that working with the public was rewarding and can bring\u000a      real benefits to their research; viii) public involvement created a\u000a      greater sense of connection and ownership of local spaces; and ix) the\u000a      majority of scientists involved wanted to continue to engage the public in\u000a      their research. (Impact levels 2 and 3; Corroborative sources 1, 3,\u000a          4, 5, 6, and 7).\u000a    6) Practitioners and professional services: have benefited in a variety\u000a      of different ways. For example: i) OPAL's high quality science programme\u000a      has given confidence to both teachers and students to carry out more\u000a      fieldwork; ii) OPAL resources are stimulating, straightforward and\u000a      informative &#8212; over 800 primary and more than 1,000 secondary schools have\u000a      registered for OPAL materials; iii) over 2,000 people have taken part in\u000a      OPAL training sessions; iv) by involving people in their research,\u000a      scientists have made their work more relevant to everyday life; and v)\u000a      OPAL has developed new ways of bringing societies and communities together\u000a      to raise awareness of their work. Nearly half of OPAL grant-funded\u000a      societies have increased their membership by more than 10% (Impact\u000a          levels 1 and 4; Corroborative sources 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Open-Air Laboratories (OPAL) project was funded by a &#163;14.4 million\u000a      grant from The Big Lottery Fund and represented one of the largest public\u000a      participation initiatives in environmental research projects ever. The Grenfell-Baines\u000a        School of Architecture, Construction and Environment (the unit of\u000a      assessment, UoA) was one of nine academic partners to benefit from this\u000a      funding (see REF 5a).

The UoA's specific role in this\u000a      research evaluated participants' engagement; the work of which was part of\u000a      32 OPAL (regional) sub-projects delivered by nine universities and six\u000a      other participating organisations in England (OPAL, 2013). This engagement\u000a      embraced a wide range of communities, including socially marginalised\u000a      groups who would not otherwise have been afforded such opportunity, to\u000a      engage in natural and environmental science (Toogood, 2013). The\u000a      project provided a unique platform for: achieving far-reaching community\u000a      benefits; maximising societal involvement; and developing OPAL longevity.\u000a    Unlike other regional OPAL projects, the UoA's contribution spanned both\u000a      multi-regional and national foci.

Huggins, with Izushi then developed models to\u000a      examine regional competitiveness from an international perspective. In\u000a      2002, the results of one project were formulated as the World\u000a        Knowledge Competitiveness Index, with the underlying model designed\u000a      as an integrated and overall benchmark of the knowledge capacity,\u000a      capability and sustainability regions across the globe, and the extent to\u000a      which this knowledge is translated into economic value and transferred\u000a      into the wealth of the citizens of these regions. As with the UK level\u000a      index, this tool has also been further developed, refined and expanded,\u000a      with each new version made publicly available through a report and\u000a      accompanying spreadsheets. The third model developed by Robert Huggins\u000a      Associates focused on examining the competitiveness of Europe's regions\u000a      and nations. This led to the establishment of the European\u000a        Competitiveness Index, whereby competitiveness is defined as the\u000a      capability of an economy to maintain increasing standards of living for\u000a      those who participate in it by attracting and maintaining firms with\u000a      stable or rising market shares in an activity.\u000a    Impact on UK and international policymaking\u000a      Since 2008, the research has been disseminated to a policymaker audience\u000a      principally through reports containing the concepts, methodologies and\u000a      metrics of the UK Competitiveness Index, European\u000a        Competitiveness Index and World Knowledge Competitiveness Index.\u000a      During this period, the reports have been downloaded from a bespoke\u000a      website (www.cforic.org) 50,722 times (as of 25th October\u000a      2013). The research has also been disseminated via the media, reaching a\u000a      wide range of audiences, including regional, national and supranational\u000a      (principally European Commission) policymakers. For instance, the Financial\u000a        Times published significant articles in 2008 (3 September) and 2010\u000a      (19 April). Other dissemination has occurred through presentations of the\u000a      research to policymaker audiences, notably the Global Competitiveness\u000a      Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (January, 2009), attended by policymakers\u000a      and industry representatives.\u000a    In the UK, the research - especially that disseminated through the UK\u000a        Competitiveness Index - has transformed the way a large number of\u000a      regional and local authorities: (1) assess the economic performance of the\u000a      places within their jurisdiction; (2) develop strategies and targets to\u000a      improve the economic performance of these places; and (3) market and\u000a      promote these places, particularly with regard to the attraction of\u000a      investment. This is evidenced by the fact that since 2008 the research has\u000a      appeared in the policy documentation of at least 80 regional or local\u000a      authorities (or stakeholder partnerships) in the UK. For example, in 2009,\u000a      authorities in Manchester adopted the research as a key means of\u000a      developing a new strategic enterprise framework for the city, in\u000a      particular for establishing a rationale for focusing intervention on a\u000a      particular range of activities [1]. In York, the York Economic Partnership\u000a      (YEP), involving the local authority and other stakeholders, utilised the\u000a      research in their 2011 documentation outlining the future economic\u000a      strategy for the city. In particular, YEP used the research to provide a\u000a      better understanding of the performance of the city and the strategic\u000a      actions required to facilitate improvement [2]. This led to YEP developing\u000a      what they termed a `new approach' to strategic development involving\u000a      multiple organisations from across the city-region.\u000a    The influence of the research has permeated across both urban and rural\u000a      places. For example, Somerset County Council utilised the researchers'\u000a      work within their own 2010 commissioned documentation relating\u000a      specifically to the economic competitiveness of the local authority area\u000a      [3]. This resulted in concrete recommendations being proposed as to how\u000a      the local public sector can best support improvements to economic\u000a      competitiveness in Somerset. Also in 2008, the research became an integral\u000a      feature of the impact analysis of the European Social Fund Objective One\u000a      Programme for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, with it acting as an\u000a      important assessment measure of the extent to which funding impacted on\u000a      the region's underlying economic performance [4]. As a result, a number of\u000a      recommendations were established, including one that addressed the low\u000a      participation in the knowledge economy through investments in Convergence\u000a      Programmes.\u000a      Within the UK, the research has also influenced national level\u000a      policymaking. In 2010, the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES)\u000a      reviewed the research team's work on regional competitiveness\u000a      differentials to better understand the geography of UK competitiveness,\u000a      and the associated implications in terms of developing a policy agenda to\u000a      raise employment and skill levels in the UK [5]. In March 2011, the UK\u000a      government announced the establishment of a &#163;100m Growth and Innovation\u000a      Fund to boost investment in skills and training as means of directly\u000a      addressing the competitiveness issues raised by the UKCES.\u000a    The research - principally that disseminated through the World\u000a        Knowledge Competitiveness Index and the European Competitiveness\u000a        Index - has had an international policy impact. In 2010, the\u000a      European Commission designed and published its first EU Regional\u000a      Competitiveness Index. This EC-led work drew significantly on the concepts\u000a      and methodologies originally developed by the researchers, as highlighted\u000a      by significant references to their work in the Commission's publication\u000a      [6]. Similarly, policymakers in overseas locations have incorporated the\u000a      research into their deliberations and actions. For instance, city\u000a      authorities in Grand Rapids, USA utilised the concepts and measures\u000a      relating to `knowledge competitiveness' to provide a fuller understanding\u000a      of the economic evolution of the city and its future prospects (2008) [7].\u000a      Other examples of international policy impact can also be cited. In 2008,\u000a      the city of Helsinki drew upon the research to formulate a vision for the\u000a      city, which resulted in activities to increase internationalisation and\u000a      integration into the global economy [8]. In Ireland, the national\u000a      development agency - Forf&#225;s - integrated the methodology and measures\u000a      provided by the European Competitiveness Index within a comprehensive\u000a      competitiveness benchmarking framework [9].\u000a    At the international level, the research has influenced agendas beyond\u000a      regional and local development. In 2009, the work of the researchers\u000a      formed part of the deliberations of the International Institute for\u000a      Sustainable Development - a not-for-profit policy research institute - in\u000a      their formulation of a `responsible competitiveness' agenda [10]. In\u000a      addition, Huggins was asked in 2011 to join a team advising the General\u000a      Secretariat of the Executive Council of Abu Dhabi on the development of\u000a      methodologies for examining the competitiveness of the emirate in relation\u000a      to innovation. This led to the creation of `The Competitiveness Office of\u000a      Abu Dhabi' by the Department for Economic Development in Abu Dhabi.\u000a      Huggins has also advised the Competitiveness Office on developing a\u000a      `Regional Competitiveness Index for Abu Dhabi'.\u000a      Since 2008, Huggins has acted as an advisor or consultant on\u000a      competitiveness issues to the following organisations: East of England\u000a      Development Agency (2008); One North East (North East England Development\u000a      Agency) (2009); Greater Merseyside Partnership (2009); UK Government\u000a      Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2010\/11); British\u000a      Chambers of Commerce (2012); Regional Australia Institute (2012); and\u000a      Chambers of Commerce in Colombia (2012).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research pertaining to the concept and theory of regional competitiveness\u000a      has permeated economic development policymaking in the UK and overseas.\u000a      Economic development policymaking has become increasingly devolved from\u000a      the national level to government decision-makers at the regional, city and\u000a      local level. This has required such policymakers to establish new\u000a      strategies, modes of assessment, and marketing plans to facilitate and\u000a      promote economic development. Cardiff's research has helped to transform\u000a      the perception, activities and strategies of decision-makers through the\u000a      provision of new concepts, methods and metrics for assessing regional\u000a      competitiveness.

Within the\u000a      study, Professor Robert Huggins (then Senior Research Associate) developed\u000a      new concepts, methodologies and measures to understand the competitiveness\u000a      of regions, cities and localities. At the time there were already a number\u000a      of established models for measuring competitiveness differences across\u000a      nations, but there was very little research on sub-national and\u000a      territorial differentials in competitiveness. Therefore, the research\u000a      offered a new means of both conceptualising and measuring geographic\u000a      uneven development.\u000a    The research undertaken at Cardiff established an innovative model for\u000a      benchmarking the economic performance of regions that went beyond the\u000a      traditional focus of examining certain indicators and regions in\u000a      isolation. Instead, the research provided the groundwork for a new form of\u000a      benchmarking that draws upon an integrated suite of indicators that are\u000a      comparative across regions. In particular, the regional competitiveness\u000a      framework developed at Cardiff provided a tool that moved beyond a focus\u000a      on single economic measures, such Gross Domestic Product per capita, that\u000a      fail to fully capture differences in the performance of economic systems\u000a      across regions, or the reasons underlying these differentials.\u000a    The competitiveness framework also provided a new means for classifying\u000a      regions, which in due course allowed policymakers and analysts to identify\u000a      `competitor' and `comparator' regions from where they may wish to seek and\u000a      transfer relevant policies and economic strategies. In this respect, the\u000a      research provided a basis for supporting the evolution in regional\u000a      policymaking from processes that are undertaken principally on an\u000a      intra-regional basis to one that integrates processes based on\u000a      inter-regional learning. The research, therefore, helped set a policy\u000a      agenda which recognises that whilst each region has a unique combination\u000a      of competitiveness requirements, economic integration and globalisation is\u000a      necessitating heightened interaction and linkage, resulting in the need\u000a      for regions to increasingly pool and consolidate their competitive\u000a      strengths as a means of eradicating their weaknesses.\u000a    The initial research undertaken by Huggins was formulated as the UK\u000a        Competitiveness Index, the first tool to provide a composite measure\u000a      of the competitiveness of the UK's regions, cities and localities. After\u000a      publishing the Index at Cardiff in 2000 - Huggins, R.

(see Background, section 4)\u000a    Huggins returned to academia in 2005 and to Cardiff, as Professor, in\u000a      2008. Overall, his research has established `regional competitiveness' as\u000a      a new theoretical lens through which to consider the uneven economic\u000a      development of places. However, as with many emerging concepts and\u000a      theories, it has become one of the most keenly contested constructs within\u000a      economic geography. Since his return to Cardiff, Huggins and colleagues\u000a      (including Dr Hiro Izushi, Aston University and Dr Piers Thompson, Cardiff\u000a      Metropolitan, then Nottingham Trent University) have contributed\u000a      significantly to these debates.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3469","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has influenced the Welsh Government in taking a more\u000a      integrated approach to the development of rural policy. Ministers and\u000a      their advisers are also better able to target policy on specific rural\u000a      problems based on the detailed evidence and understanding provided by the\u000a      Cardiff team. Other beneficiaries include a diverse range of policy,\u000a      practitioner and community organisations in Wales, the UK and the EU, who\u000a      have used Cardiff research findings in rural policy debates.\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000a    In the early 2000s, the evidence gap in Welsh rural policy was addressed\u000a      by the award to a Cardiff-led team (directed by Milbourne and including\u000a      Marsden) of the first Wales Rural Observatory (WRO) grant (2003-07, &#163;1.6M,\u000a      funded by the Welsh Government). The team secured continued funding for\u000a      the WRO from 2007 to 2013 (&#163;2.45M, Welsh Government and European\u000a      Commission). The WRO has applied Marsden's `rural web' model of integrated\u000a      policy development and Milbourne's insights into the nature of rural\u000a      poverty to specific research themes requested by the Welsh Government.\u000a      Commissioned research projects have investigated inter alia\u000a      poverty, housing needs and homelessness, service provision in deep rural\u000a      localities, the eco-economy and the impacts of Common Agricultural Policy\u000a      (CAP) reform on farm households. As a result of these activities, the\u000a      Cardiff-led team has created Wales' first major evidential resource on\u000a      social, economic and environmental change in rural areas, with the Welsh\u000a      Government Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and European\u000a      Programmes stating at a recent WRO conference (22 March 2012, Cardiff) :\u000a      \"I know from personal experience how valuable the Rural Observatory has\u000a      been in increasing our understanding of the needs of rural Wales.\"\u000a    The WRO regularly organises dissemination events for the Welsh Government\u000a      and its partner organisations on its findings. The corpus of research that\u000a      it has developed has attracted broad media coverage in Wales, featuring in\u000a      the Western Mail, Daily Post, Farmers' Guardian, and on the BBC News\u000a      website. Milbourne and Marsden have also directly disseminated their\u000a      research to Ministers, Welsh Assembly Members and other policy-makers\u000a      through frequent advice to Welsh and UK Government bodies. For example\u000a      Milbourne's research on rural poverty in Wales resulted in an appointment\u000a      to the Welsh Government's Financial Inclusion Steering Group (2009-12) and\u000a      an invitation to present evidence to the National Assembly for Wales'\u000a      Rural Development Sub-committee Inquiry into Poverty and Deprivation in\u000a      Rural Wales (2008). He was also appointed in 2011 to the Wales Rural\u000a      Development Programme Monitoring Committee, which oversees the\u000a      implementation of European rural development policy in Wales (2013-20).\u000a      Milbourne's research on rural housing and homelessness led to him being\u000a      appointed as the academic consultant on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's\u000a      Commission on Rural Housing in Wales (2007-08)5.4, which led to\u000a      the establishment by the Welsh Government of a network of Rural Housing\u000a      Enablers to tackle rural housing needs across Wales. Marsden's work on\u000a      integrated rural policy development resulted in him being invited to\u000a      advise on the development of the new Welsh Future Generations Bill, and\u000a      the new Environment and Sustainability Committee inquiry into Sustainable\u000a      Land Management. He was also invited to present research evidence from his\u000a      research to the National Assembly for Wales' Rural Development Committee\u000a      (RDP) on local and regional agri-food initiatives (2012), the Wales RDP\u000a      Committee (2012) and the Welsh Government's CAP Reform Committee (2013).\u000a    Impact on policy-making\u000a    The Welsh Government's Head of Rural Policy, Terri Thomas, has stated\u000a      that \"the work of the WRO has made a fundamental contribution to the\u000a      development of rural policy within the Welsh Government in a number of\u000a      ways. The reports that have been provided by WRO allow rural policy\u000a      officials to.... secure modifications to policy proposals to ensure the\u000a      needs of rural areas are properly considered.\"5.1 For example,\u000a      the WRO's Deep Rural Localities project (2009) revealed the Welsh\u000a      Government and local authorities needed to do more to deal with the\u000a      specific problems of isolated communities in rural Wales. These problems\u000a      included lack of broadband provision, an unresponsive public transport\u000a      system and poor heating and energy use in rented properties. In a written\u000a      statement on 15.12.09, the Minister for Rural Affairs acknowledged the\u000a      importance of the researchers' application of a more integrated approach\u000a      to tackling rural problems, stating that \"Cabinet...has identified\u000a      priority issues including community transport, broadband provision and\u000a      wider rural proofing, and agreed to co-operate across portfolios...[The]\u000a      findings provide the Government with a sound understanding of issues\u000a      affecting deep rural areas and we will now develop a co-ordinated approach\u000a      to address them.\"5.2 In a later debate on rural communities\u000a      (22.5.12), the First Minister was questioned on the Welsh Government's\u000a      subsequent response to the research. He stated: \"If you look at the \"Deep\u000a      Rural Localities\" research, you will see that as a result of that, four\u000a      community transport pilot projects were awarded money in order to take\u000a      them forward...It has led to the development and expansion of\u000a      interventions on ICT... and helped inform home energy efficiency\u000a      programmes, and make them more relevant to rural dwellers. Crucially, it\u000a      also raised awareness and understanding of the level, breadth and specific\u000a      characteristics of rural poverty enabling WG to take due account of these\u000a      factors when developing its Tackling Poverty Programme.\"5.3\u000a    Key findings from another WRO research project - on CAP reform and\u000a        farm households - have also been influential in shaping the\u000a      development of rural policy in Wales. Evidence from this research was used\u000a      by the National Farmers Union in its written evidence to the UK\u000a      Parliament's Welsh Select Affairs Committee's Inquiry into Broadband\u000a      Services in Wales in May 2011.\u000a    In relation to European policy, Terri Thomas states that WRO research\u000a      reports were used by the Welsh Government to argue with the European\u000a      Commission for a specifically Welsh implementation of the 2007-2013 Rural\u000a      Development Plan and in negotiations over the 2014-2020 Plan. WRO work has\u000a      also examined the likely impact of CAP reform on Welsh agriculture,\u000a      adopting Marsden's concept of analysis by farm household. The research\u000a      found that some 68 per cent of these households felt vulnerable in some\u000a      way to the changes, with 10 per cent contemplating selling up. Thomas\u000a      comments that \"the reports from these studies have been invaluable in\u000a      forming a picture of how the industry operate at a farm household - as\u000a      opposed to farm business - level and helping officials to gauge the impact\u000a      of the coming changes and the mitigating actions that are likely to be\u000a      most effective.\"5.1\u000a    Research projects have also influenced Welsh policy on sustainability,\u000a        food and rural development. Marsden was appointed as Special Advisor\u000a      to the Welsh Assembly Sustainable Development Committee, providing advice\u000a      on the merger of the three environmental bodies in Wales - Forestry\u000a      Commission, Environmental Agency and Countryside Commission for Wales. His\u000a      advocacy of a more integrated approach to land-based policy management led\u000a      to the Committee establishing a new merged body Natural Resource Wales\u000a      (April, 2013).5.7\u000a    The Cardiff team's research on food policy and regulation has\u000a      been significant in developing new food policy in Wales and the UK. The\u000a      Chatham House Food Supply project5.8 initiated on the basis of\u000a      Marsden's research developed four global food supply scenarios to\u000a      understand the effects of food uncertainties on the EU\/UK. The scenarios\u000a      ranged from treating high food prices as a `blip' to a permanent crisis in\u000a      the world food supply. The report, co-authored by Marsden, reflected his\u000a      research in calling for an integrated approach to securing the supply\u000a      chain, building in technological innovation, waste reduction and other\u000a      strategies, rather than viewing the agricultural sector in isolation. The\u000a      report received considerable UK media interest and led to a major\u000a      international Chatham House conference in October 2008, which was attended\u000a      by more than 150 national and international delegates from the food,\u000a      financial and government sectors. The resulting Cabinet Office\u000a      investigation of the global food crisis led to the UK Government's\u000a      publication in 2008 of Food Matters: Towards a strategy for the 21st\u000a        century5.9. The report acknowledged the uncertain range\u000a      of potential future food scenarios and called for a more comprehensive\u000a      food policy. This UK report resulted in the Cardiff team being\u000a      commissioned by the Welsh Government to undertake research to support the\u000a      development of a `radical' food strategy for Wales, entitled Food for\u000a        Wales, Food from Wales 2010-20205.10, which highlighted\u000a      the significance of the agri-food sector to economic development policy in\u000a      Wales and resulted in the establishment in 2012 of the Welsh Government's\u000a      Food Industry Task Group.\u000a    Impact on policy debate\u000a      Research findings from specific WRO projects have shaped diverse rural policy\u000a        debates in Wales, having been used in briefings produced by Children\u000a      in Wales, End Child Poverty Network Cymru, Woodland Trust Wales, House of\u000a      Lords Research Service, and the Welsh Local Government Association. In\u000a      2008, Milbourne delivered the keynote paper at an EU policy conference on\u000a      Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion in Rural Areas in Budapest5.5.\u000a      He highlighted the problems of denial among poor rural people and the\u000a      difficulties of shaping policy response to the specific difficulties of\u000a      rural poverty. This paper was later cited in a World Health Organisation\u000a      (2010) report on Rural Poverty and Health in the WHO European Region5.6\u000a      as evidence of the rural impacts of the global economic downturn.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In the late 1990s the new Welsh Assembly Government publicly acknowledged\u000a      a significant evidence gap in relation to rural policy.

In relation to the\u000a      first theme, research has concentrated on integrated rural development\u000a      (funded by several European Commission grants), sustainable development\u000a      and communities (ESRC-funded) and agri-food regulation and governance\u000a      (funded by ESRC, Chatham House, Welsh Government). This body of research\u000a      has made significant empirical, methodological and theoretical\u000a      contributions to academic understanding of rural development and agri-food\u000a      systems. More than 60 comparative rural case studies from across Europe\u000a      have been used to construct a more integrated and grounded theory of rural\u000a      development. It has involved the construction of a conceptual model - the\u000a      rural web - that incorporates a range of inter-related key domains,\u000a      including institutional arrangements, market governance, endogeneity,\u000a      sustainability novelty and social capital. This inter-relation of issues\u000a      has also highlighted the need to refine EU and national level policy\u000a      mechanisms to facilitate more integrated and sustainable forms of rural\u000a      development. Research on food policy and regulation undertaken before and\u000a      during the food price volatilities of 2007-8 has also provided the first\u000a      fully integrated assessment of the global food crisis. The research has\u000a      also demonstrated that an effective response to this crisis would need to\u000a      integrate several policy fields including transport, energy, waste and\u000a      water. Collectively, these projects have produced a series of\u000a      agenda-setting journal articles, research monographs and edited books.\u000a    A second strand of research has made major contributions to debates on\u000a      rural welfare. Funded research has examined rural housing needs and\u000a      homelessness (ESRC, Welsh Government, Joseph Rowntree Foundation) and\u000a      rural poverty (ESRC, Welsh Government) in the UK. Other research funded by\u000a      RCUK - through the New Dynamics of Ageing programme - has provided the\u000a      first study of poverty amongst older people in rural Britain. Together,\u000a      these projects have highlighted the statistical significance and uneven\u000a      geographies of poverty and homelessness in rural Britain, as well as the\u000a      prominence of older people within the rural poor population. This work has\u000a      also demonstrated some distinctive features of rural poverty that\u000a      perpetuate its cultural and political invisibility, including poor\u000a      people's denials of poverty, the complex relations between community,\u000a      nature and understandings of poverty, and the ways in which traditional\u000a      paternalistic social structures continue to shape attitudes to welfare in\u000a      rural areas, leading to a reluctance on the part of the poor and homeless\u000a      to accept state support. Further research has examined the scalar politics\u000a      of rural welfare provision, highlighting the role of local political\u000a      discourse in resisting welfare provision and how the delivery of welfare\u000a      services is bound up with complex coalitions of actors drawn from the\u000a      public and voluntary sectors, and involving different spatial scales. This\u000a      broad body of research has led to the production of a large number of\u000a      significant publications on rural poverty, homelessness and welfare.\u000a    These strands of research were led by Marsden (Professor,1995-) and\u000a      Milbourne (Professor, 1999-).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3470","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    At a time when obesity affects one in seven children, according to the\u000a      NHS, the research resonated with a wide audience of policy-makers and\u000a      professional practitioners. This was due in large part to the results\u000a      being broadcast internationally through a robust dissemination strategy,\u000a      which included 60 conferences (including the UN) in 16 countries. For\u000a      example, the Sustainable Food Cities conference (2011) had over 500\u000a      delegates, including practitioners from 20 UK cities and 15 NGOs. The\u000a      dissemination strategy also involved extensive engagement with influential\u000a      national and international media organisations, including BBC, which in\u000a      2011 conferred the Radio 4 Food and Farming Award to the Food for Life\u000a      Partnership (FFLP) [1], a five-year programme, established by the Soil\u000a      Association in 2007, which was heavily influenced by the research. As\u000a      stated by Helen Browning, the Chief Executive of the Soil Association:\u000a      \"Cardiff University's collation and analysis of international good\u000a      practice case studies has helped us to visualise better school food\u000a      services, impacting directly on our own programme of school food\u000a      transformation through the Food for Life programme\" [2]. Funded through a\u000a      &#163; 16.9 million grant from the Big Lottery and involving four charities,\u000a      the FFLP is the most transformative school food programme in Europe. It is\u000a      currently being implemented in more than 4,300 English schools, reaching\u000a      over 500,000 children, and preliminary results show that the initiative\u000a      has made a genuine difference, especially as regards the number of primary\u000a      school children eating 5-a-day. Dr. Sonnino's invited participation in the\u000a      Soil Associations' Catering Mark Standards Committee since 2011 will\u000a      ensure that the Cardiff team's expertise continues to support this\u000a      important reform effort in the UK.\u000a    In Wales, the research was `very valuable and relevant' to the\u000a      government's reform of the national school food policy, Appetite for\u000a        Life, according to Jane Hutt, the Welsh Government's Finance\u000a      Minister. [3] Morgan and Sonnino were invited to serve on school food\u000a      reform task forces in Wales (2008) and Scotland (2009) and to be part of\u000a      the team that designed and wrote the first National Food Strategy for\u000a      Wales in 2010 &#8212; a document commissioned by the Welsh Government to make\u000a      the national food system more sustainable. Professional practitioners (in\u000a      Carmarthenshire, East Ayrshire, Greenwich and Rome) have used the research\u000a      to introduce new criteria into their public contracting processes to\u000a      ensure that sustainability criteria are allotted parity of esteem with\u000a      more conventional economic criteria - the first step in the transition to\u000a      a more sustainable school food system. [4]\u000a    In Scotland, the research was instrumental in translating local good\u000a      practice into national policy through the direct participation of Dr.\u000a      Sonnino in the task force that designed the national food and drink policy\u000a      &#8212; Walking the Talk &#8212; Getting Government Right (2009). The adviser\u000a      on Food Policy from the Food, Drink &amp; Rural Communities Division of\u000a      the Scottish Government, Robin Gourlay, wrote, \"Morgan and Sonnino's ESRC\u000a      funded research continues to be a vitally important touchstone in my work\u000a      as it is in many spheres for practitioners involved in sustainable\u000a      procurement, community planning, health and education.\" [5]\u000a    Morgan and Sonnino were invited to address two sessions of the United\u000a      Nations, when it convened the Seventeenth Session of its Commission on\u000a      Sustainable Development (4-15 May 2009), where member countries and NGOs\u000a      assembled to discuss the design and delivery of sustainable food systems.\u000a      As a result of these sessions, the researchers were invited to both\u000a      Zimbabwe and Kenya to discuss the promotion of food security through\u000a      stronger urban-rural linkages. [6] The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) has\u000a      drawn extensively on the research to inform its own creative procurement\u000a      programme - Purchase for Progress. [7] In 2012, WFP bought US$1.1\u000a      billion worth of food to feed more than 90 million people.\u000a    Furthermore, the research `strongly contributed to the conceiving and\u000a      rethinking of programmes such as the Home Grown School Feeding\u000a      (HGSF),' according to the WFP, which had formed a partnership with the\u000a      Gates Foundation to commission the researchers to deliver a study of HGSF.\u000a      [8] This allowed the Cardiff team to engage with policy-makers and\u000a      practitioners in low and medium income countries (principally Brazil,\u000a      Ghana and South Africa) that were reforming school food systems. [9]\u000a    Findings from this research were discussed in a World Bank Report: Rethinking\u000a        School Feeding. As a result of this, Sonnino was invited to\u000a      participate in a high-profile workshop in London (January 2012) on\u000a      `building the evidence-base for school feeding policies' - sponsored and\u000a      organized by the World Health Organization, the School Food Trust and the\u000a      World Bank. [10]\u000a    Based on these impacts and the extensive engagement of the researchers\u000a      with policy-makers and practitioners, in 2013 Morgan and Sonnino were\u000a      awarded the Economic and Social Research Council's Celebrating Impact\u000a        Prize for outstanding impact on public policy. This is the first\u000a      ever award given to an ESRC-funded project of outstanding social impact,\u000a      and the competition was extremely strong, with more than 30 applications\u000a      received for the public policy category. The researchers were invited to a\u000a      high-profile award ceremony, held in London in May 2013, which received a\u000a      wide coverage on a range of scientific and government web sites. The Prize\u000a      has been designed to further enhance the impact of the research; as a\u000a      first initiative, it will support Sonnino's travelling to the Negev region\u000a      in December 2013 to provide advice on an Israeli-Palestinian collaborative\u000a      initiative on procurement and sustainable local development.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research furnished evidence for school food reform in the UK, Italy,\u000a      the USA and developing countries. Examining the pioneering experience of\u000a      school food reformers in Europe, North America and Africa, the research\u000a      showed that the power of public purchase can transform the quality of\u000a      school food.

The primary focus of the research was the power of\u000a      public procurement and the regulatory, political and cultural factors that\u000a      shaped the way it was designed and deployed.\u000a    The key insights of the ESRC research were the following:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aRegulatory regime: the reform of public procurement regulations\u000a        in the EU raised the status of sustainability criteria in the awarding\u000a        of public catering contracts, allowing public bodies to procure higher\u000a        quality and more locally-produced food than had been the case hitherto\u000a        (Morgan and Sonnino, 2008).\u000a      \u000aNational diversity: the national interplay of culture and\u000a        politics was found to be the main reason as to why member states\u000a        interpreted EU regulations differently. Italy and the UK interpreted\u000a        \"best value\" in radically different ways because of the different\u000a        cultural values they attached to food &#8212; intrinsically significant in\u000a        Italy, where the school meal was meant to provide for children's health\u000a        and educational needs; instrumentally significant in the UK, where\u000a        school food was not seen as integral to children's education (Morgan and\u000a        Sonnino, 2007; Sonnino, 2009).\u000a      \u000aPublic procurement: the research demonstrated that in the UK\u000a        and the USA the power of purchase is in practice hindered by a number of\u000a        barriers, principally: legal uncertainty as to what is permissible under\u000a        EU\/Federal procurement regulations; a consumer culture that commends\u000a        quantity over quality in food choice\/provision; and a low-cost catering\u000a        culture that is biased towards \"cheap food\" options (Morgan and Sonnino,\u000a        2008). In developing countries, the research showed that public\u000a        procurement failed to calibrate demand and supply of local and\u000a        nutritious food due to the inadequacy of the governance structure and an\u000a        unrealistic timeline chosen for the reform process (Morgan, 2010).\u000a      \u000aValue for money: the research showed that \"value for money\" is\u000a        a highly contested concept that needs to be based on a metric of whole\u000a        life cost, rather than low upfront cost (Morgan, 2008).\u000a      \u000aPower of purchase: creative public procurement requires a\u000a        supportive political milieu and a professional climate in which\u000a        procurement officers have the confidence and competence to internalise\u000a        health and environmental costs in their public contracts (Sonnino,\u000a        2010).\u000a      \u000aDiffusing good practice: the research showed that more\u000a        effective diffusion mechanisms of social learning are needed in the\u000a        public sector (where performance is highly variable) if good practice is\u000a        to become the norm, rather than the exception (Morgan, 2008).\u000a    \u000a    The significance of the research stemmed from the fact that it coincided\u000a      with public outrage (as seen by protesting parents, media coverage) about\u000a      food insecurity and childhood obesity. This gave the research a high\u000a      political prominence and robustness because it was based on a new and\u000a      solid evidence base that examined school food reform in a comparative\u000a      perspective.\u000a    The key researchers involved in this body of research (which was carried\u000a      out in the period 2005- 2009) were Kevin Morgan and Roberta Sonnino,\u000a      respectively Professor and Reader in the School of Planning and Geography\u000a      at Cardiff University.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3474","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research is being used globally as a tool for providing scientific\u000d\u000a      research and evidence in urban planning.\u000d\u000a    a. sDNA is being used in China. Chinese urban planners operate mostly\u000d\u000a      with intuitive design skills, which are increasingly insufficient for\u000d\u000a      planning development in a mixed-market land economy. The attraction of\u000d\u000a      sDNA to China's army of urban planners is its ability to predict urban\u000d\u000a      system performance (pedestrian and car movements and relative volumes,\u000d\u000a      land use demand at different points in the urban grid, land value, and\u000d\u000a      tantalisingly from our epidemiological studies, urban health outcomes),\u000d\u000a      all from network geometry. This offers the prospect of \"proofing\"\u000d\u000a      strategic plans at all scales early on in the process of urban planning.\u000d\u000a      Guoyan Zhou, director of Renew A+P Consulting, Shanghai, said \"SDNA is\u000d\u000a        a great evaluation method for the analysis and decision-making on\u000d\u000a        different plans in China.\" [Error! Reference source not\u000d\u000a      found.].\u000d\u000a    sDNA is being used, for example, by Renew A+P Consultants, Shanghai and\u000d\u000a      Hefei University of Technology (HUT), Anhui Province, China to evaluate\u000d\u000a      the spatial design of a major growth corridor in the city of Huainan, part\u000d\u000a      of a plan to accommodate another 1.2 million people in the city; and by\u000d\u000a      Tongji University design institute planning consultants to evaluate\u000d\u000a      accessibility and economic performance of underground parts of cities.\u000d\u000a    b. The network approach to urban plan evaluation has been widely\u000d\u000a      disseminated across China by the Cardiff team via keynote and invited\u000d\u000a      speeches to large and high profile audiences. Together with the Space\u000d\u000a      Syntax team at UCL and the MIT network analysis team, it has triggered new\u000d\u000a      conversations, expectations and research among the professional and\u000d\u000a      academic urban planning communities. On the basis of this research,\u000d\u000a      Webster has been appointed, for example, to the influential Wuhan Urban\u000d\u000a      Research Network, a cross-disciplinary expert forum giving strategic\u000d\u000a      guidance to the economic, social and spatial growth of this city of 10\u000d\u000a      million.\u000d\u000a    c. sDNA has been used by consultants BRS (France) and dEp (UK) [1]\u000d\u000a      to prepare spatial planning policy and an investment plan in one of Paris'\u000d\u000a      five new towns (150,000 inhabitants). sDNA helped appraise community\u000d\u000a      severance resulting from alternative spatial strategies. Impacts include:\u000d\u000a      a plan that more efficiently guides spatial development over the plan\u000d\u000a      period; creation of a 1400km detailed pedestrian network model as a basis\u000d\u000a      for the severance study (a world first in the sophistication of an\u000d\u000a      analytical base for pedestrian\/walking-oriented urban planning); a\u000d\u000a      location plan for a new, light, and rapid transit option for this\u000d\u000a      community as part of the Grand Paris multi-billion Euro regional transport\u000d\u000a      project.\u000d\u000a    d. sDNA has been used by Arup [2], in its preparation of a\u000d\u000a      spatial strategy plan for Wiltshire County Council, with (Westminster\u000d\u000a      Government) Homes and Community Agency funding. The action research\u000d\u000a      involved creating a new methodology for a high resolution pedestrian\u000d\u000a      network model. Currently detailed pedestrian networks in UK towns and\u000d\u000a      cities are not readily available. The pedestrian model was used for\u000d\u000a      evidence-based appraisal and evaluation of alternative town development\u000d\u000a      strategies. Impacts include: Guiding spatial development with greater\u000d\u000a      efficiency over the plan period of a market town centre in the UK;\u000d\u000a      suggesting new strategies that might have otherwise been overlooked (town\u000d\u000a      extension impact); providing a greater evidence base with a stronger\u000d\u000a      technical narrative to lower the transaction costs of plan preparation and\u000d\u000a      adoption; making planning strategies for different towns more consistent\u000d\u000a      by virtue of a common analytical approach.\u000d\u000a    e. sDNA is being used in partnership with Cardiff University Medical\u000d\u000a      School and with the UK Biobank project based at Oxford University to\u000d\u000a      introduce objectively measured built environment indicators into\u000d\u000a      analytical epidemiological models and public health debates. The UK\u000d\u000a      Biobank is a major national health resource, with the aim of improving the\u000d\u000a      prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of serious and\u000d\u000a      life-threatening illnesses through data on 500,000 people. Funded by UK\u000d\u000a      Biobank, sDNA is producing over 100 built environment metrics\u000d\u000a      (epidemiology-modelling quality) for each of the Biobank's 500,000 cohort\u000d\u000a      members. This creates the world's largest and most sophisticated cohort\u000d\u000a      study for gene-built-environment studies of disease in the community. As a\u000d\u000a      result of this work, the sDNA team is working with the Coalition\u000d\u000a      Government's Chief Planner (at the Department for Communities and Local\u000d\u000a      Government) and with the Royal Town Planning Institute [3] to\u000d\u000a      explore new protocols for evidence-based urban planning. An agreement has\u000d\u000a      also been reached with the Dean of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong\u000d\u000a      to apply sDNA to three big public health science cohorts in China. This\u000d\u000a      collaboration has now started. In April 2013 the UK Biobank funding was\u000d\u000a      supplemented by one of ESRC's Transformative Research grants to conduct\u000d\u000a      `Urban WHealth modelling' at UK level.\u000d\u000a    f. sDNA has provided the methodological basis for several major funded\u000d\u000a      research projects closely linked to policy making agencies, with several\u000d\u000a      others under discussion. For example, in July 2013 the Turkish Government\u000d\u000a      awarded a significant grant to a team based at Gazi University Ankara,\u000d\u000a      Istanbul City University, Cardiff University and Hong Kong University to\u000d\u000a      study the optimal timing sequence of residential and retail development by\u000d\u000a      the municipality of Ankara and Istanbul using sDNA [5]. This\u000d\u000a      project will help guide the work of Istanbul's powerful new Urban\u000d\u000a      Transformation development agency as it sets about spatially\u000d\u000a      re-configuring a massive 75% of the city's fabric. Istanbul has 14 million\u000d\u000a      inhabitants and this is the largest ever application of the tool of land\u000d\u000a      readjustment (temporary expropriation, redevelopment, reorganising\u000d\u000a      property rights and reallocation pro-rata less a fraction to cover cost of\u000d\u000a      redevelopment).\u000d\u000a    g. In 2013, sDNA was presented within a suite of three-level walking\u000d\u000a      modelling framework by an independent transport planning consultant to a\u000d\u000a      network with over 300 industry professionals from the UK and Ireland at\u000d\u000a      the 11th Annual UK Transport Practitioner Meeting, Birmingham\u000d\u000a      and at the international conference Walk 21, Munich, with 500 delegates\u000d\u000a      from health, transport and planning professionals who are working\u000d\u000a      increasingly together throughout the world to deliver more liveable and\u000d\u000a      successful places. On both occasion the audience consisting of transport\u000d\u000a      modellers and other practitioners who work with modellers found the\u000d\u000a      three-level framework useful as a way of conceptualising different stages\u000d\u000a      of analysis in a design and planning process. The audience was very\u000d\u000a      receptive and appreciative of the framework and of sDNA capacities [Error!\u000a      Reference source not found.].\u000d\u000a    h.

This research has developed a tool that blends spatial\u000d\u000a      analysis with economics into a unique methodology to appraise baseline\u000d\u000a      plans and evaluate the impact of alternative urban configurations. It\u000d\u000a      rests on the premise that complex information about the way people\u000d\u000a      interact is mediated through a city's street network. Retrieving that\u000d\u000a      information as indices and relating those indices to urban performance\u000d\u000a      measures allows urban plans to be evaluated for specific outcomes.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Cardiff University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cardiff University","InstitutionName":"Cardiff University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007814}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2988507","Name":"Paris"},{"GeoNamesId":"2867714","Name":"Munich"},{"GeoNamesId":"1791247","Name":"Wuhan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1818058","Name":"Anhui Sheng"},{"GeoNamesId":"4930956","Name":"Boston"},{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"},{"GeoNamesId":"323786","Name":"Ankara"},{"GeoNamesId":"2867714","Name":"München"},{"GeoNamesId":"745044","Name":"Istanbul"},{"GeoNamesId":"1796231","Name":"Shanghai Shi"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

As a result, construction professionals have been able to simulate\u000d\u000a      more accurately the energy performance of buildings and large-scale urban\u000d\u000a      developments and retrofit programmes. This has orchestrated significant environmental\u000a        benefits. In the UK alone over a quarter of all CO2 emissions derive\u000d\u000a      from the fuel used in homes. However tighter energy efficiency standards\u000d\u000a      for homeowners can cut domestic CO2 emissions by 80%. Moreover, globally a\u000d\u000a      considerable proportion of CO2 emissions and energy use is attributable to\u000d\u000a      buildings - approximately 40% according to the international Energy\u000d\u000a      Agency.

These tools are specifically developed to inform\u000d\u000a      the design process at an early stage, when major decisions are made and\u000d\u000a      impact is greatest, as well as checking at the more developed detailed\u000d\u000a      design stages. These tools now benefit the building industry, and their\u000d\u000a      underpinning research is explained below:\u000d\u000a     HTB2 [1] is simulation software that predicts the thermal\u000d\u000a      energy performance of buildings under varying weather and occupancy\u000d\u000a      conditions. The software was developed solely within the WSA, with major\u000d\u000a      developments in the last 15 years. Alexander has been responsible for its\u000d\u000a      recent development and distribution, with contributions from Lannon and\u000d\u000a      Jones. The flexibility and ease of modification of HTB2 [2]\u000d\u000a      has made it eminently suited for use in the rapidly evolving field of\u000d\u000a      energy efficiency and the sustainable design of buildings. The model has\u000d\u000a      kept pace with changes in the design and construction industry through a\u000d\u000a      continuing process of extension, testing, and modification. Since 1988,\u000d\u000a      reflecting the growing importance of energy efficient buildings,\u000d\u000a      developments include: chilled and heated surface environmental systems, a\u000d\u000a      range of infiltration and ventilation models, and detailed simulation of\u000d\u000a      advanced glazing systems and multiple skin facades [3,4]. It has been\u000d\u000a      combined with the HVAC model BEACON (funded through a Hong Kong Government\u000d\u000a      Grant) to produce the model BEEP, aimed at the Hong Kong commercial\u000d\u000a      market.\u000d\u000a    The motivation for creating EEP, arose from a need to\u000d\u000a      extend performance-based assessment from single buildings to urban scale.\u000d\u000a      Research into urban modelling at the WSA began in 1994, funded through an\u000d\u000a      EPSRC grant [GR\/K19181: To Develop a Model for Energy and Environmental\u000d\u000a      Planning for Sustainable Cities, 1994-98] continuing with further EPSRC\u000d\u000a      funding [GR\/L81536: Development and completion of the EEP model,1998-2001]\u000d\u000a      and followed by EPSRC \/ MRC funded research [G9900679: Housing\u000d\u000a      Neighbourhoods and Health 2001-3 ]. The main research aim was to integrate\u000d\u000a      energy simulation tools with Geographical Information Systems (GIS), with\u000d\u000a      additional models addressing transport, air pollution and health to\u000d\u000a      support analysis of complex urban processes. This software framework\u000d\u000a      allows different simulation tools to communicate and share data, for\u000d\u000a      example, simple energy tools can be used, such as the UK SAP annual energy\u000d\u000a      predictor, as used in UK Building Regulation calculations, or, more\u000d\u000a      complex energy models such as HTB2. EEP was initially developed to\u000d\u000a      consider the existing built environment and allow planners and designer to\u000d\u000a      address major urban retrofit projects [5,6]. After further research and\u000d\u000a      development, the software now offers a comprehensive urban modelling tool\u000d\u000a      for planning and designing new urban developments, predicting energy use,\u000d\u000a      CO2 emissions and the potential for collecting solar energy. The latest\u000d\u000a      version has replaced the original GIS framework with Google's SketchUp\u000d\u000a      and Google Earth, to provide pre-processing computational\u000d\u000a      environments that are commonly used by designers [7], and enabling the\u000d\u000a      simultaneous simulation of 100's of buildings using advanced models such\u000d\u000a      as HTB2, to provide annual hourly data on energy and thermal performance.\u000d\u000a    Marsh began the development of Ecotect, an integrated\u000d\u000a      building analysis software package, initially through his PhD, before\u000d\u000a      joining the WSA in 2001. During his 5 year tenure to 2006, as a Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow, he collaborated with colleagues on the development and application\u000d\u000a      of building simulation tools, carrying out major developments of Ecotect,\u000d\u000a      and integrating it with other modelling software, including HTB2,\u000d\u000a      and the WSA's Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) airflow model\u000d\u000a          WINAIR [8]. This research included testing numerical models\u000d\u000a      against physical scale models of complex estates, allowing modelling of\u000d\u000a      internal and external spaces on the same scale [9]. This version of Ecotect\u000d\u000a      has since made significant worldwide penetration into architectural\u000d\u000a      practice and teaching since its purchase by Autodesk Inc. in 2008.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3658","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact on EU policy, legislation and standards\u000d\u000a\u0009HARMONAC was the\u000d\u000a      major reference source used as evidence concerning the impact of the\u000d\u000a      original Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) 2002 on energy\u000d\u000a      efficiency in HVAC systems in practice [5.1, 5.2].

The research\u000d\u000a      produced the following insights specific to the impact claimed here:\u000d\u000a    Between 2000 and 2002, a research project funded by the Building Research\u000d\u000a      Establishment (BRE), Toshiba Carrier and the National Grid Transco led by\u000d\u000a      Professor Ian Knight of the Welsh School of Architecture (1987 to present)\u000d\u000a      undertook detailed monitoring of air-conditioning (AC) system energy use\u000d\u000a      in 32 UK Office Buildings. The published results from this empirical work\u000d\u000a      provided a first insight into the ranges of energy consumption achieved by\u000d\u000a      various types of AC systems in UK Offices. The work showed that, despite\u000d\u000a      serving similar activities, the energy consumptions achieved\u000d\u000a      in practice could be very different, and that some of this difference\u000d\u000a      depended on the design of the cooling system [3.1].\u000d\u000a    A follow-on BRE funded project which analysed the breakdown of energy use\u000d\u000a      between the various components of the AC systems, showing the role of all\u000d\u000a      system components in overall AC system energy use, was undertaken between\u000d\u000a      2002 and 2004 (led by Ian Knight [3.2]). The above research projects led\u000d\u000a      to an invitation to Ian Knight to participate as a Work Package Leader in\u000d\u000a      the European project AUDITAC (Field benchmarking and market development\u000d\u000a      for audit methods in air conditioning) proposed by &#201;cole des Mines, Paris\u000d\u000a      between Jan 2005 and Dec 2006. This project demonstrated that application\u000d\u000a      of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) Standard for the\u000d\u000a      mandatory Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) Inspection of\u000d\u000a      AC systems was difficult to achieve in practice with the number of\u000d\u000a      accredited inspectors available in Europe, as well as not being cost\u000d\u000a      effective in many instances [3.3].\u000d\u000a    Ian Knight proposed and ran a further European scale project (HARMONAC -\u000d\u000a      Harmonizing Air Conditioning Inspection and Audit Procedures in the\u000d\u000a      Tertiary Building Sector) to assess the impact of inspection of air\u000d\u000a      conditioning systems on energy efficiency in practice, with a view to\u000d\u000a      establishing savings achieved and identifying where procedural\u000d\u000a      improvements might be found. HARMONAC ran from September 2007 to August\u000d\u000a      2010, and established that the range of energy conservation opportunities\u000d\u000a      identified in individual AC systems by inspection was limited to 37% of\u000d\u000a      the potential energy savings identified in those same systems by\u000d\u000a      concurrent detailed energy measurements [p10 3.4]. This meant that the\u000d\u000a      full range of potential energy savings was only accessible by detailed\u000d\u000a      measurement. [3.4,3.5]\u000d\u000a    Following HARMONAC, Ian Knight is now running the pan-European iSERV\u000d\u000a      project (Inspection of HVAC systems through continuous monitoring and\u000d\u000a      benchmarking &#8212; 2011 - 2014).\u000d\u000a    iSERV applies the HARMONAC findings to 1000+ European HVAC systems across\u000d\u000a      20+ EU Member States, to establish HVAC component energy benchmarks for\u000d\u000a      specific end use activities [3.6].

Octavia have also reviewed their contingency plans and developed\u000d\u000a      a built asset management strategy that integrates adaptation of their\u000d\u000a      existing stock to future climate change. This represents a fundamental\u000d\u000a      change in approach to adaptation which is normally reactive rather than\u000d\u000a      pro-active. SBERGs involvement with Octavia is on-going [5.8].\u000d\u000a    In TSB project `EM\/1520160' (2011-2012), members of SBERG joined the\u000d\u000a      client's team (the University of Greenwich) to examine the adaptation\u000d\u000a      needs to climate change of a new 15,267m2 educational building.\u000d\u000a      SBERG helped develop a range of future performance scenarios against which\u000d\u000a      adaptation solutions were assessed. Twenty five adaptation solutions were\u000d\u000a      developed by the building's design team (Heneghan Peng, Hoare Lea,\u000d\u000a      Fanshawe and Alan Baxter Associates) of which seven (ranging from\u000d\u000a      technical changes to the original design, to future changes in service\u000d\u000a      equipment) were adopted by the client and included in a future\u000d\u000a      refurbishment strategy. This again represents a fundamental change in\u000d\u000a      approach to climate change adaptation where the future performance of the\u000d\u000a      building is proactively considered at the design stage and future\u000d\u000a      solutions integrated into long-term built asset management strategies. The\u000d\u000a      integration of climate change adaptation into the initial design stage of\u000d\u000a      a building was presented to an international audience of Facilities\u000d\u000a      Managers and Built Environment Professionals at the EFMC2013 Conference in\u000d\u000a      Prague [5.9].\u000d\u000a    Finally, the SBERG team worked closely with the London Climate Change\u000d\u000a      Partnership, Climate South East, London Confederation of Small Businesses\u000d\u000a      and the London Knowledge Transfer Network to ensure that the CREW\u000d\u000a      project's outputs raised awareness\/understanding and stimulated debate of\u000d\u000a      climate change resilience and adaptation amongst London businesses.

The barriers associated with implementing adaptation\u000d\u000a      solutions were examined through an RBS-funded International PhD\u000d\u000a      Scholarship, won by Jones. This project identified the adaptation\u000d\u000a      decision-making process from a business perspective [3.5]. Both the\u000d\u000a      performance-based management model and business decision model formed the\u000d\u000a      theoretical basis of a subsequent EPSRC project (Jones was the PI)\u000d\u000a      investigating Community Resilience to Extreme Weather Events (CREW).\u000d\u000a    The multi-disciplinary CREW consortium project (2008-2011), involving 14\u000d\u000a      UK universities, examined how existing communities could better prepare\u000d\u000a      for and recover from future extreme weather events. Jones and Dr Ali\u000d\u000a      (full-time member of SBERG since 2009) were responsible for developing an\u000d\u000a      adaptation framework that could be integrated into the built asset\u000d\u000a      management process [3.4]. The framework involved translating\u000d\u000a      vulnerability, resilience and adaptive capacity of buildings and\u000d\u000a      communities (Ali and Jones, 2013) to extreme weather events into a series\u000d\u000a      of performance metrics. The metrics were tested through a field study of\u000d\u000a      social housing [3.3] whilst the wider policy implications were explored\u000d\u000a      through joint workshops with Greater London Authority, Confederation of\u000d\u000a      Small Businesses, local Councils, local community groups and insurance\u000d\u000a      industry representatives.

To\u000d\u000a      reduce these emissions the UK Government has developed design guidance for\u000d\u000a      new building, but hasn't addressed the problems associated with existing\u000d\u000a      buildings. The Sustainable Built Environment Research Group (SBERG) at the\u000d\u000a      University of Greenwich was established by Professor Jones in 1996\u000d\u000a      to undertake research to support the development of a sustainable built\u000d\u000a      environment, and in particular to understand the complex interaction\u000d\u000a      between people, the built environment they use and occupy, the natural\u000d\u000a      environment, and the economics that support daily life. The research\u000d\u000a      underpinning this impact case study is drawn from two EPSRC projects that\u000d\u000a      explored the issues surrounding mitigation of existing buildings to\u000d\u000a      climate change:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Innovation in the Design, Construction and Operation of Buildings for\u000d\u000a        People (IDCOP);\u000d\u000a      Carbon, Control &amp; Comfort: user-centred control systems for\u000d\u000a        comfort, carbon saving and energy management (CCC).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In 2004 Professor Jones was co-investigator on the EPSRC IDCOP\u000d\u000a      project (2004-2009) [3a], involving three UK universities and 16\u000d\u000a      industrial partners. It aimed to identify the innovation required to\u000d\u000a      ensure that buildings continued to support the needs of businesses and\u000d\u000a      citizens over the next 50 years. Prof Jones carried out a detailed\u000d\u000a      questionnaire survey and follow up interviews of Social Housing managers\u000d\u000a      to investigate the barriers to the effective retrofitting of low carbon\u000d\u000a      solutions in domestic buildings [3.3]. He identified the importance of\u000d\u000a      human behaviour (both individual and corporate) in reducing energy\u000d\u000a      consumption in the home and the need to understand the socio-technical\u000d\u000a      interface (eg in the development of energy control systems, lifestyle\u000d\u000a      behaviours etc.) when developing low carbon retrofit solutions. The\u000d\u000a      research also identified the significance of individual and corporate understanding\u000d\u000a        of sustainability as a key indicator of the willingness to invest in\u000d\u000a      the retrofit of mitigation measures to existing buildings.\u000d\u000a    The socio-technical factors affecting the retrofitting of low carbon\u000d\u000a      mitigation measures to existing social housing were further investigated\u000d\u000a      in the EPSRC CCC project (2009-2012) [3b]. This multidisciplinary,\u000d\u000a      three-year project investigated the relationship between comfort in the\u000d\u000a      home and the systems used to deliver it, involving seven universities,\u000d\u000a      EoN, three commercial partners and seven social landlords. Prof Jones was\u000d\u000a      a co-investigator and led the University of Greenwich team (comprising\u000d\u000a      engineers and psychologists) which explored the meaning of comfort and its\u000d\u000a      relationship to CO2 emissions through a controlled extensive\u000d\u000a      intervention study of 53 households (pre and post intervention interviews,\u000d\u000a      physical house surveys and monthly energy use monitoring). Prof Jones's\u000d\u000a      team developed and tested no-cost behavioural interventions (local\u000d\u000a      benchmarking with monthly feedback and a home user guide with helpful\u000d\u000a      hints). The interventions resulted in an 18% reduction in energy\u000d\u000a      consumption between the control and intervention sample homes [3.1]. The\u000d\u000a      project also identified the importance that habit plays in energy\u000d\u000a      consumption and how energy providers and social housing landlords could\u000d\u000a      play a crucial role in changing habits by engaging with tenants during\u000d\u000a      periods of change, either through an energy systems retrofit or change in\u000d\u000a      tenancy [3.2].\u000d\u000a    The research from both these projects identified the importance of\u000d\u000a      socio-technical factors (eg linking technology to lifestyle, linking\u000d\u000a      personal understanding to built asset management etc.) in the effective\u000d\u000a      mitigation of climate change in the home.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4421","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research by the Liverpool School of Architecture Lighting Group has made\u000a      a significant and active contribution to the formulation of national and\u000a      international design guidance, and hence on the design practice of the UK\u000a      and international lighting industry. In addition the methods developed\u000a      during the research were taken up in the R&amp;D test protocols for the\u000a      lighting industry.\u000a    The development of lighting design for interiors to take account of\u000a        room contents\u000a      Research on lighting of building interiors, which are obstructed by room\u000a      contents, commenced in 1983 and early work on light loss assessment and\u000a      luminaire layouts led to the effects of obstruction being included in\u000a      lighting design for the first time, with results from the research being\u000a      incorporated into the 2009 and subsequent Society of Light and Lighting\u000a      Code for Interior Lighting. The significance of this is that internal\u000a      obstructions account for approximately 10% light loss. Although lighting\u000a      designers know of this effect they traditionally over-design the system in\u000a      compensation, with resultant unnecessary energy use and costs. The\u000a      research permits that over-design to be eliminated. Active collaboration\u000a      with Thorn Lighting in the UK and Toshiba Lighting and Technology\u000a      Corporation, Japan, extended the design methods to take account of a wide\u000a      range of building types and lighting equipment. Both companies used the\u000a      results to inform their lighting design procedures.\u000a    The report Lighting design for obstructed interiors from the\u000a      Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) Technical Committee TC 3-31,\u000a      Chaired by Carter, drew heavily on the Liverpool work and the report\u000a      continues to act as specialist reference for national and international\u000a      design codes.\u000a    Of particular significance to this case study is the related research on\u000a      obstructed interiors, which has led to the development of methods used for\u000a      field measurement of task and planar illuminance in occupied interiors.\u000a      This work is incorporated into the current (2012) Society of Light and\u000a      Lighting Code for Interior Lighting (used in the UK), and also into the\u000a      CIE\/ISO Interior Code (Lighting of work places Part 1: Indoor 2001) which\u000a      remains the main code world-wide.\u000a    Involvement of the occupant in the control of light levels and\u000a        electricity usage\u000a      The research on lighting control investigated the manner in which people\u000a      use individual systems to create a satisfactory visual environment. The\u000a      research demonstrated that users with individual control select lower\u000a      light levels than those specified in codes and the resulting lower\u000a      electricity usage is beneficial for the environment. This research was\u000a      funded by, and in collaboration with, the Building Research Establishment\u000a      and supported by ECS Lighting Control and the results were incorporated\u000a      into the lighting control element of the current revision (2010) of Part L\u000a      of the UK Building Regulations.\u000a    The replacement of electric lighting with guided daylight systems\u000a      The initial Liverpool research on electric source guidance was supported\u000a      by Simplex Lighting, a manufacturer of luminaires for industrial\u000a      applications. It developed both methods of analysis of the photometric\u000a      performance of these devices and methods of extraction and redirection of\u000a      delivered light, both of which were applied to the development of the\u000a      Conductalite luminaire, marketed by Simplex. This research was the basis\u000a      for a study of tubular daylight guidance systems - devices which collect,\u000a      transport and distribute daylight deep into buildings - undertaken with\u000a      the two UK market leaders, Monodraught and Solatube. The impact of the\u000a      work has been threefold:\u000a    \u000a      The results formed the scientific basis both for understanding the\u000a        photometry of the devices and their relationship with the building they\u000a        light, and for the design procedures used by the manufacturers and\u000a        installers.\u000a      Dr Carter was appointed Chair of Commission International de\u000a        l'Eclairage Technical Committee TC 3-38, concerned with tubular daylight\u000a        guidance systems.\u000a      Dr Carter was co-author of the present UK guidance document on fibre\u000a        optic and remote source lighting, produced jointly by the Institution of\u000a        Lighting Engineers and the Society of Light &amp; Lighting.\u000a    \u000a    In addition, current research on hybrid lighting systems, undertaken in\u000a      cooperation with two companies, Parans Solar Lighting and Limitless,\u000a      continues to inform the design procedures for hybrid systems of both\u000a      companies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Lighting Group has been involved in the formulation of national and\u000a      international design guidance, with impacts on the practices of the UK and\u000a      international lighting industry.\u000a    This guidance offers designers the tools to create optimum visual\u000a      conditions in energy efficient buildings while reducing electric lighting\u000a      usage.

The approach has been to use\u000a      field measurement and computer simulation to investigate the effect of\u000a      innovative concepts and devices on interior lighting. In addition, a range\u000a      of post- occupancy evaluation techniques have been developed to establish\u000a      human reaction to these innovations. A combination of the two approaches\u000a      has enabled design guidances to be framed, which have been trialled by\u000a      cooperating industrial partners, before forming national and international\u000a      design guidance documents, now used worldwide.\u000a    The first theme investigated is lighting design in complex and obstructed\u000a      spaces (1993 - 2002). Conventional calculation methods assume an empty\u000a      room as the main condition, but in real interiors, illuminance is affected\u000a      by room contents such as furniture and machinery. The research has yielded\u000a      generalised predictions of losses in real interiors such as offices. This\u000a      was extended into design guidance on selection and positioning of\u000a      luminaires for minimum light loss and hence minimum electric usage. Key\u000a      outputs include 1 and 2 cited in the next section.\u000a    The second theme (1998 - 2008) is the manner in which employees use\u000a      individual lighting control systems to create a satisfactory visual\u000a      environment in offices. The research demonstrated that users with\u000a      individual control select lower light levels than those specified in codes\u000a      and the resulting lower electricity usage is beneficial for the\u000a      environment. A parallel study of user reaction to the systems led to\u000a      design guidance, to take advantage of the large energy savings obtained by\u000a      the use of this technique. Key outputs include 3 cited in the next\u000a      section.\u000a    The third theme is remote source lighting, where source and output\u000a      devices are separated by a guidance system. This has three strands. The\u000a      initial research on electric source guidance developed both methods of\u000a      analysis of photometric performance and methods of extraction and\u000a      redirection of delivered light. This was followed by research on daylight\u000a      source systems (1997 - 2001). Research on the influence of system\u000a      configuration on illuminance and visual quality of passive tubular\u000a      daylight guidance systems was undertaken by a combination of field\u000a      measurement and assessment of human response, and the integration of the\u000a      passive light output devices with conventional interior electric lighting\u000a      was also addressed (2001- 2012).\u000a    The third theme, on remote source systems, concerns hybrid systems (2006\u000a      -2012), which simultaneously deliver daylight and electric light. The\u000a      research examines light delivery and potential energy savings for\u000a      commercial buildings. The results established usage patterns (the\u000a      proportions of daylight, electric and hybrid lighting) for combinations of\u000a      building configuration, geographic location and types of daylight delivery\u000a      system. The significant variation in performance with system type,\u000a      geographic location, and building geometry, has confirmed that choice of\u000a      appropriate light guidance system is strongly influenced by building\u000a      location.

The working group comprises scientists, test\u000a      laboratories and\u000a      manufacturers of domestic appliances, water services and mechanical\u000a      installations. Research at\u000a      Liverpool on the reception plate method of measuring vibrating machines\u000a      [ref 5] formed the basis\u000a      of the European Standard, EN 15657-1:2009, a laboratory method for\u000a      measuring mechanical\u000a      installations in heavyweight buildings.

Manufacturers of\u000a      heating, ventilation and\u000a      transportation (e.g. lifts) systems, and domestic appliances can now\u000a      measure their products in\u000a      laboratories and estimate if they will comply with noise limits when\u000a      installed in buildings. Test rigs\u000a      based on this research have been constructed in approximately ten\u000a      laboratories across Europe\u000a      and manufacturers are currently using the test data for product\u000a      development. During this period the\u000a      research received EPSRC funding (grant period 2006-2009), and recently was\u000a      supported by a\u000a      major manufacturer, the Baxi Group (EPSRC grant 2010-2013). As a result of\u000a      this collaboration,\u000a      Baxi have been able to improve installation procedures to reduce noise\u000a      from its new generation of\u000a      domestic combined heating and power (CHP) units [Corroboration source\u000a      No.3].\u000a    The successful completion of EN 15657-1:2009 prompted a request for\u000a      further work relevant to the\u000a      development of the new generation of sustainable building types,\u000a      particularly timber-frame and\u000a      timber-composite multi-occupancy dwellings. These buildings are likely to\u000a      be even more heavily\u000a      mechanically serviced than traditional buildings but they are inherently\u000a      less able to resist noise\u000a      transmission. This further work began in 2009 with the research at\u000a      Liverpool providing the main\u000a      impetus [refs 4,5] and Professor Gibbs is currently co-authoring a new\u000a      European Standard, EN\u000a      15657-2, with Michel Villot of CSTB [Corroboration source No. 1].\u000a    The underlying research by Professor Gibbs is also feeding into the\u000a      development of R&amp;D test\u000a      protocols for the qualification of vibrating components in aircraft, on\u000a      which he is currently\u000a      collaborating with Boeing (USA) [Corroboration source No.4].\u000a    Sound insulation\u000a      Dr Hopkins has significant influence on Standardisation in building\u000a      acoustics. In 2009 Dr Hopkins\u000a      was appointed Chair of the British Standards committee on building\u000a      acoustics (EH\/1\/6). Due to his\u000a      research expertise on flanking transmission in buildings, he was appointed\u000a      Convenor of European\u000a      and International Standards groups on the measurement of flanking\u000a      transmission of building\u000a      elements (CEN\/TC126\/WG6 and ISO\/TC43\/SC2\/WG17) in 2009 and 2010. Due to\u000a      his recent\u000a      research on the measurement of sound insulation, he was voted Convenor of\u000a      three International\u000a      Standards groups on field measurement of sound insulation in buildings\u000a      (ISO\/TC43\/SC2\/WG18\u000a      Project Groups 5, 6 and 7) in 2009. In 2010, four new International\u000a      standards were published on\u000a      sound insulation measurement of building elements, which all reference the\u000a      research monograph\u000a      on sound insulation that was sole-authored by Dr Hopkins as a key text\u000a      [Hopkins, 2007; ref. 3].\u000a    In 2009, Dr Hopkins was Head of the UK Delegation to the ISO\/TC43\/SC2\u000a      plenary session on\u000a      building acoustics in South Korea. He prepared and presented the UK\u000a      proposal to revise all four\u000a      International Standards on field sound insulation measurement, due to\u000a      demands from the UK\u000a      acoustic consultancy industry. This drew upon his recent research on the\u000a      efficacy of manual-scanning measurements for sound pressure levels [Hopkins, 2011, ref. 6]\u000a      and low-frequency\u000a      sound insulation measurements to tackle issues relating to the poor\u000a      acoustic performance of\u000a      timber-frame buildings. He was subsequently appointed Convenor of the\u000a      project group to revise\u000a      these Standards. His research forms the basis for three new International\u000a      Standards (ISO 16283\u000a      Parts 1, 2 and 3), on the field measurement of sound insulation in\u000a      buildings, with Part 1 now in its\u000a      final stage [Corroboration source No. 6] and Part 2 now at the penultimate\u000a      stage [Corroboration\u000a      source No.7].\u000a    Building regulations in 24 European countries refer to the current\u000a      versions of the field\u000a      measurement Standards and they will automatically adopt the new ISO 16283\u000a      series of Standards\u000a      that will replace them. These Standards are essential to check that the\u000a      required level of sound\u000a      insulation is achieved in buildings, primarily in dwellings, for\u000a      compliance with National Building\u000a      Regulations. They are particularly important for the UK construction\u000a      industry as there are\u000a      approximately 35,000 field sound insulation tests per annum, providing a\u000a      direct income of\u000a      approximately &#163;10M per annum for acoustic consultants. This is in addition\u000a      to income of\u000a      approximately &#163;53M that UK consultants earn using these Standards in\u000a      building acoustics.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of building acoustics research by the Acoustics Research Unit\u000a      at Liverpool has been\u000a      through knowledge transfer into Standardisation, guidance to industry and\u000a      take-up by test\u000a      laboratories.

This is in response to the\u000a      sustainability imperative for\u000a      low-cost, low-carbon dwellings and work spaces. The prediction of sound\u000a      transmission is more\u000a      complex for lightweight constructions compared to traditional heavyweight\u000a      constructions [Hopkins,\u000a      2007, ref 3] and, prior to the research, well-established prediction\u000a      models existed only for the latter.\u000a    The second is the increased mechanisation of buildings including\u000a      residential, commercial and\u000a      industrial. The noise generated by mechanical services is structure-borne\u000a      in origin. Vibrations from\u000a      heating, ventilation and water systems and from elevators and domestic\u000a      appliances are transmitted\u000a      to the building structure and ultimately radiate as unwanted sound into\u000a      rooms.\u000a    The third is the need to improve the accuracy and repeatability of the\u000a      field sound insulation\u000a      measurements that are required in Building Regulations to ensure legal\u000a      compliance with\u000a      performance standards for airborne and impact sound insulation.\u000a    Professor Gibbs has developed laboratory methods of measurement for\u000a      machine vibrations, which\u000a      provide data for prediction models that can be used to test noise control\u000a      solutions for machinery\u000a      installed in buildings [Corroboration source No.1]. Two underpinning\u000a      concepts have been\u000a      developed to the point of knowledge transfer. The first concerns\u000a      vibrations of complicated\u000a      machines which can be measured in the laboratory by attaching them to a\u000a      well-defined structure\u000a      and measuring the vibration response of that structure [Gibbs and Spaeh,\u000a      2002-present; ref. 5].\u000a      The second concerns the development of a two-stage method which allows all\u000a      installation\u000a      conditions to be considered, including modern lightweight timber-frame and\u000a      timber-composite\u000a      buildings as well as traditional heavyweight buildings [Gibbs et al,\u000a      2005-2008; refs. 2,4,5]. This\u000a      allows the vibration of machines to be described in terms of the single\u000a      values much favoured by\u000a      manufacturers, engineers and designers [Gibbs, 2006-2009; ref. 2],\u000a      significantly reducing the\u000a      complexity of measurement and calculation. Mechanical installations\u000a      generally cause low-\u000a      frequency noise problems, which are not easily predicted and controlled.\u000a      This research is replacing\u000a      existing and often inaccurate methods with a method which takes into\u000a      account the resonant\u000a      behaviour of rooms and building elements [Gibbs and Maluski, 1998 - 2002;\u000a      ref. 1].\u000a    Dr Hopkins has developed new methods [2011; ref. 6] to theoretically\u000a      assess the efficacy of\u000a      manual scanning paths for acoustic engineers and environmental health\u000a      officers carrying out\u000a      sound insulation or environmental noise measurements, i.e. manually moving\u000a      a sound level meter\u000a      around a room in order to measure the spatial-average sound pressure\u000a      level. The research has\u000a      quantified the efficacy not only of simple existing paths, e.g. circles,\u000a      but also of more complex\u000a      geometrical paths. This has led to proposals for new manual scanning paths\u000a      which are highly\u000a      efficient in producing good estimates of the spatial-average sound\u000a      pressure level [Corroboration\u000a      source Nos.2,5].\u000a    Key Researchers:\u000a      Academic Staff: Professor B.M.

Evidence of this can be found in published material where the\u000d\u000a      work is cited (e.g., Bate 2010: 95; Velez-Serna 2011: 544-46); TV\/Radio,\u000d\u000a      press and media coverage (e.g., BBC, ITV, GMTV); and impact reports (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Impact 08; AHRC reviews) linked to Liverpool's nomination as European\u000d\u000a      Capital of Culture 2008. Our three consecutive AHRC projects, on film and\u000d\u000a      cities, contributed to the national `Screen Heritage UK' programme.\u000d\u000a      Liverpool received special mention as `a very successful programme' in the\u000d\u000a      British Film Institute's report to the House of Lords Select Committee on\u000d\u000a      Communications, in its inquiry into the British film and television\u000d\u000a      industries, 2009. The BFI relied on this work when preparing its\u000d\u000a      subsequent `Portrait of Britain' national project.\u000d\u000a    The reach and significance of our research into cinematic geography,\u000d\u000a      archaeology and place is in three specific areas:\u000d\u000a    1. Enhancements to heritage preservation, conservation and presentation:\u000d\u000a    a) Film Databases, 2008, 2014: The creation of two city film\u000d\u000a      databases (City in Film and Cinematic Geographies of Battersea) has transformed the way researchers,\u000d\u000a      practitioners and the public can interrogate film archives. Web statistics\u000d\u000a      show that several thousand visitors used the resource.\u000d\u000a    b) BFI Screenonline 2008-9: Collaboration with the BFI on the  Liverpool Screenonline project, the UK's first film archive of a city\u000d\u000a      (45,000 users by March 2013), was developed and made available to schools,\u000d\u000a      universities and public libraries. Organisation of nine\u000d\u000a      screening\/discussion events with local filmmakers, artists, community\u000d\u000a      activists, which were attended by between 30 and 800 participants.\u000d\u000a    c) Mitchell and Kenyon, St George's Hall, 2008: With Prof.\u000d\u000a      Toulmin (Sheffield University) and the BFI, as part of Liverpool's 2008\u000d\u000a      European Capital of Culture programme, re-enacted the screening of\u000d\u000a      material from one of the UK's most important film archives &#8212; Mitchell and Kenyon's Liverpool Films (1901\/2). The first venue in\u000d\u000a      Liverpool had an audience of over 1,000. The screening had impact in terms\u000d\u000a      of engaging the public with the history of the city using archive film and\u000d\u000a      on people's memory of the city (Liverpool Echo, 30.04.08; Daily\u000d\u000a        Post, 06.05.08), TV (ITV) and radio (BBC Merseyside).\u000d\u000a    2. Production of cultural artefacts to enhance cultural understanding\u000d\u000a        of place and people:\u000d\u000a    a) Members of the research group were consultants to Hurricane Films for\u000d\u000a      Terrence Davis' film Of Time and the City, 2008, and used archive footage sourced\u000d\u000a      through their research. The contribution is acknowledged in the film\u000d\u000a      credits. The digital database by Koeck and Roberts, including the\u000d\u000a      retrieval and study of films at the North West Film Archive, enabled\u000d\u000a      filmmakers to create the first Liverpool feature-length film composed\u000d\u000a      entirely from archive footage. The film was screened and received special\u000d\u000a      mention at Cannes\u000a        Film Festival 2008; nominations for a BAFTA\u000d\u000a      and British Independent Film Award (Best British Documentary, 2008) and a\u000d\u000a      New York Film Critics Circle Award (2009), and positive newspaper reviews\u000d\u000a      e.g. in The Guardian.\u000d\u000a    b) Two installations at the National Museums of Liverpool (NML), 2011-12:\u000d\u000a      Lumi&#232;re\u000a          and the Overhead Railway and Mapping the City in Film\u000d\u000a      provided opportunities for two permanent exhibitions, utilising animation,\u000d\u000a      historical maps and interactive displays at the\u000d\u000a        Museum. The work provided previously unknown spatial context of the\u000d\u000a      earliest Liverpool films. It was the most visited museum outside London in\u000d\u000a      2011-12. Lectures were attended by more than 1000 people and were reported\u000d\u000a      on the History\u000d\u000a        Network in the USA.\u000d\u000a    3. Stimulation of public debate:\u000d\u000a    a) Urban Planning Strategies: Koeck served as consultant to Nanning\u000d\u000a      (2010), Macau (2011) and Nanjing (2012) to develop with them film\/visual\u000d\u000a      culture-based strategies for city branding and urban regeneration. The\u000d\u000a      Nanning Urban and Rural Planning Bureau subsequently revised its\u000d\u000a      development into a regeneration, which included the preservation of a\u000d\u000a      historical inner-city district. This change in policy, with greater\u000d\u000a      emphasis on \"cultural industry\" and \"cultural heritage\", was publically\u000a        announced by the government.\u000d\u000a    b) English Heritage was a partner on Cinematic\u000a          Geographies of Battersea (2012-13). This project led to new\u000d\u000a      understanding regarding the role of moving images\/film for the UK's\u000d\u000a      cultural heritage as well as the use of digital and social media to\u000d\u000a      `stitch' cultural history back into urban space. It is the first time that\u000d\u000a      The Survey of London (founded 1894) has referenced this role of film in\u000d\u000a      the context of an investigation of urban\/architectural heritage.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Interdisciplinary research by the Centre for Architecture and the Visual\u000d\u000a      Arts (CAVA), based in the School of Architecture, is on the role of the\u000d\u000a      moving image in the culture and identity of cities. By examining historic\u000d\u000a      film, current trends and future developments in city branding and digital\u000d\u000a      imaging, a new field of research has developed with three types of\u000d\u000a      beneficiary: (1) institutions (museums and galleries); (2) municipal\u000a        authorities (planning\/urban development departments); (3) inhabitants\u000d\u000a      of and visitors to cities. Liverpool's European Capital of Culture\u000d\u000a      programme (2008) formed the basis of the research, which has spread\u000d\u000a      nationally (London\/Battersea) and internationally (China).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Liverpool\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Liverpool (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Liverpool","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10006842}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1799869","Name":"Nanning"},{"GeoNamesId":"1799962","Name":"Nanjing"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Peer reviewed publications (ordered by date):\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Koeck, R.

The research by CAVA showed how it was possible to\u000d\u000a      integrate this filmic resource with other existing resources (North West\u000d\u000a      Film Archive, English Heritage) and developing sources (British Film\u000d\u000a      Institute Screenonline) to strengthen both public and professional\u000d\u000a      understanding of how the physical form of the city has developed and how\u000d\u000a      it might change in future. In addition, Geographic Information Systems\u000d\u000a      (GIS) mapping, interactive locative media, and mobile digital devices are\u000d\u000a      being used to integrate film with the direct physical experience of the\u000d\u000a      city, combining the virtual with the real.\u000d\u000a    The projects City in Film (AHRC) and Mapping the City in Film\u000d\u000a      (AHRC) were amongst the first to use GIS in an arts and humanities context\u000d\u000a      and provided the UK's first comprehensive study of filmic heritage of a\u000d\u000a      city (Liverpool). The project has brought together and documented to date\u000d\u000a      over 1700 films about the city between 1897 and 1984. The research group\u000d\u000a      assembled a spatially organised film database, allowing practitioners and\u000d\u000a      the public to search and locate archive material by, for example, spatial\u000d\u000a      function or usage. Developing these methods, Cinematic Geographies of\u000d\u000a        Battersea (AHRC) created a mobile database of nearly 600 archive\u000d\u000a      films, allowing researchers and the public to discuss and actively engage\u000d\u000a      with issues around city and film heritage. The three projects generated\u000d\u000a      made accessible and contextualised data &#8212; using e.g. physical\u000d\u000a      screenings\/installations, locative media applications and pioneering\u000d\u000a      techniques such as GIS, GPS geo-fencing, 3D, augmented reality &#8212; that\u000d\u000a      otherwise would not be available.\u000d\u000a    In developing these new resources, the research group collaborated with\u000d\u000a      public institutions, both in the UK (including North West Film Archive,\u000d\u000a      British Film Institute and English Heritage) and overseas (Nanning City\u000d\u000a      Planning Office, China), to establish approaches and applications, which\u000d\u000a      can be used worldwide and which have directly influenced subsequent work\u000d\u000a      on other cities. Examples of this influence are: the filmic mapping of\u000d\u000a      \"Postwar Architecture and the City in Greece, 1950-2010\" (Alifragkis,\u000d\u000a      University of Thessaly), \"Cinematic Rotterdam\" (Paalman, University of\u000d\u000a      Amsterdam), and \"Film.

The public events and exhibitions formed a key focus\u000d\u000a      and this has continued, e.g. at the Shanghai Expo 2010, Maxxi (Rome) 2011\u000d\u000a      and National Museums of Liverpool 2012.

Initial work investigated cob's\u000d\u000a      composition, structural performance, failure, repair and maintenance.\u000d\u000a      Presently, key researchers (Watson, Mackie, Brocklebank, Bradbury), work\u000d\u000a      in a broader context, with heat, moisture, legislation, sustainability and\u000d\u000a      culture, exemplified in the ongoing international Cordiale project on\u000d\u000a      managing landscape change producing a series of online tools influencing\u000d\u000a      the building related choices that construction professionals and occupants\u000d\u000a      take.\u000d\u000a    The EBG was established by the CEA to focus on the wider field of\u000d\u000a      sustainable construction (degrees from 1995, accreditation in 1996).\u000d\u000a      Today, the EBG complements the CEA by looking at environmental issues in\u000d\u000a      the building industry. Initially researchers such as Goodhew and\u000d\u000a      Pilkington, focussed on earth walls to establish a methodology that can be\u000d\u000a      used to measure the in situ thermal properties of mass building materials.\u000d\u000a      This has expanded to a spectrum of (predominantly natural) materials, such\u000d\u000a      as straw bale and hemp-lime, as well as hygral and acoustic performance\u000d\u000a      establishing a series of numerical values that characterise the moisture\u000d\u000a      and sound insulation performance of natural materials.\u000d\u000a    A key line of research uses thermography to assess the thermal\u000d\u000a      performance of buildings in situ, (The Telegraph, March 2006). Based on\u000d\u000a      findings that characterised the relationship between viewing thermal\u000d\u000a      images and occupant behaviour, the work has impacted the domestic energy\u000d\u000a      consumption of 690+ homeowners: 61 homes were assessed in the 21st Century\u000d\u000a      Living project with Homebase and the Eden Project, while `Cornwall\u000d\u000a      Together' with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has\u000d\u000a      added 620.

Further work has developed moisture probes,\u000d\u000a      specifically designed for monitoring the conditions in straw bale walls.\u000d\u000a      Again, these have been tested in live building environments establishing\u000d\u000a      the technique as a valid approach to inter-wall moisture monitoring for\u000d\u000a      contractors and building owners alike.

First, our access to longitudinal change data across the 39 NDC\u000d\u000a      regeneration areas, combined with evidence on individual residents\u000d\u000a      therein, allowed us more accurately to monetise both the costs and the\u000d\u000a        benefits of ABIs. This work has had an impact on central government.\u000d\u000a      This methodology based on shadow pricing was first published in the final\u000d\u000a      suite of NDC evaluation reports, and then subsequently incorporated into Communities\u000a        and Local Government's (CLG): Valuing the benefits of regeneration:\u000d\u000a        Economic Paper 7 Vol 1: Final Report (para 7.69) (S2). A\u000d\u000a      communication (24\/3\/10) from the then Head of Neighbourhoods and\u000d\u000a      Regeneration Analysis Unit at CLG indicated that the then permanent\u000d\u000a      secretary 'was particularly interested in the shadow pricing methodology\u000d\u000a      and keen that we have a debate on its application to regeneration'. In\u000d\u000a      addition the then key evaluation officer in CLG commented that 'the NDC\u000d\u000a      Evaluation made important methodological strides in valuing the benefits\u000d\u000a      of the programme in a way that had never been done before. The findings\u000d\u000a      were used by the Department to analyse and prioritise future spend. The\u000d\u000a      methodological learning gleaned through the NDC Evaluation has since\u000d\u000a      informed analysis relating to similar Government programmes where\u000d\u000a      monetising hard-to-value benefits was crucial' (S1). The potential use of\u000d\u000a      this methodology was in turn referred to in an HM Treasury and\u000d\u000a        Department of Work and Pensions 2011 Report: Valuation techniques for\u000d\u000a        social cost benefit analysis (Table p.63) (S3). A 2011 House of\u000d\u000a        Commons Communities and Local Government Committee: Regeneration Report\u000d\u000a      (par.44) (S7) using written evidence from Lawless, also referred to the\u000d\u000a      importance of formal evaluation in assessing regeneration programmes and\u000d\u000a      in ensuring lessons were retained from previous ABIs (par. 65).\u000d\u000a    Second, research insights emerging from this team enhanced understanding\u000d\u000a      of the nature of outcome change associated with regeneration\u000d\u000a      schemes. Research established that regeneration is likely to be associated\u000d\u000a      with relatively modest area-level changes, most of which reflects improved\u000d\u000a      perceptions of the neighbourhood and its environment, rather than positive\u000d\u000a      changes with regard to people-based outcomes relating to, say, jobs,\u000d\u000a      education, or health. These findings were acknowledged in the government's\u000d\u000a      2008 'Framework for Regeneration' (CLG) (S4), which propounded a\u000d\u000a      more economically orientated approach to deprived areas than hitherto,\u000d\u000a      partly because, although the NDC evaluation had shown positive change\u000d\u000a      across some outcomes, this did not extend to growth in jobs (p.3\/4).\u000d\u000a      Research findings into the scale of outcome change associated with\u000d\u000a      regeneration schemes were disseminated to key government policy\u000d\u000a      specialists at sessions held at CLG on the 25\/1\/10, 15\/3\/10, 27\/4\/10,\u000d\u000a      28\/5\/10 and 8\/6\/10. In all these were attended by around 150\u000d\u000a      representatives from five government departments (CLG, Home Office,\u000d\u000a      Business Innovation &amp; Skills, HM Treasury, and the Cabinet Office), as\u000d\u000a      well as key analysts from third arm agencies and research funding\u000d\u000a      organisations. Attendees included the then Director General Communities,\u000d\u000a      CLG, and the Head of Community Analysis, CLG. Lawless was recruited to two\u000d\u000a      of the then government's expert panels in Housing and Communities and in\u000d\u000a      Neighbourhoods, Cities and Regions. In that role he produced a think-piece\u000d\u000a      for government reflecting on research evidence (published 1\/3\/11): Regeneration&#8212;What\u000d\u000a        are the problems and what can we achieve in addressing them? These\u000d\u000a      research findings were in turn to influence two national committees.\u000d\u000a      First, whilst research showed only limited changes in relation to\u000d\u000a      employment, it also identified the useful role which job and training\u000d\u000a      schemes could play in integrating services at the local level. These key\u000d\u000a      messages were developed in Lawless's presentation (11\/12\/08) to members of\u000d\u000a      the Houghton Review on Tackling Worklessness, which were later\u000d\u000a      incorporated into that Review's final report (p. 24) (S5). Second,\u000d\u000a      Lawless's presentation (2\/7\/09) to the Marmot Review into Health\u000d\u000a        Inequalities also pointed out the limited scale of people-based\u000d\u000a      change associated with area-regeneration programmes. This finding was\u000d\u000a      reiterated in that Review's subsequent report, which concluded that NDC\u000d\u000a      evidence suggested the neighbourhood may not be an especially sensible\u000d\u000a      scale at which to plan for people-based outcomes, such as job growth\u000d\u000a      (p.137) (S6).\u000d\u000a    Research by the team also identified the limited scale of outcomes\u000d\u000a      associated with community engagement. These findings were referred to in\u000d\u000a      both the 2008 White Paper 'Communities in control: real people, real\u000d\u000a        power' (p.70) (S8), and in a House of Commons Communities and\u000d\u000a        Local Government Committee: Regeneration Report (par. 75) (S7). The\u000d\u000a      implications of these findings on debates surrounding the 'Big Society'\u000d\u000a      were in turn explored with CLG staff (26\/1\/11), including the then Head of\u000d\u000a      the Communities Analysis. In particular, the research team stressed the\u000d\u000a      importance of data pointing to the complexities in achieving robust\u000d\u000a      outcome change from community-based initiatives with regard to indicators\u000d\u000a      such as trust in institutions and residents thinking they can influence\u000d\u000a      local decisions. The implications of these research findings in relation\u000d\u000a      to the community dimension, in turn impacted on lobbying organisations and\u000d\u000a      think tanks. One nationally important lobbying organisation, the Royal\u000d\u000a      Society of Arts (RSA), used these findings to argue for community\u000d\u000a      engagement best being seen in terms of connectivity, rather than taking\u000d\u000a      place within defined 'spaces' (P.10-11) (S11). Similarly, research into\u000d\u000a      community outcomes from local initiatives informed debate amongst\u000d\u000a      think-tanks. One, Demos, supporting the broad concept of a more loosely\u000d\u000a      structured 'Big Society', used these findings to argue that the NDC\u000d\u000a      initiative lacked effective community engagement (p.36) (S9). However,\u000d\u000a      another more critical of the 'Big Society', Labourlist, used evidence to\u000d\u000a      suggest successes associated with the NDC Programme occurred exactly\u000d\u000a      because of its substantial funding base (S10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    For almost 50 years UK governments have designated area-based initiatives\u000d\u000a      (ABIs) to moderate social, economic and environmental problems in\u000d\u000a      disadvantaged urban areas. A research team from the Centre for Regional\u000d\u000a      Economic and Social Research (CRESR) has been assessing and explaining\u000d\u000a      changes associated with ABIs for more than 20 years.

Between 1988 and 2013 over 30 refereed papers\u000d\u000a      were published in journals such as Environment and Planning C, Town\u000d\u000a      Planning Review, Policy and Politics, Urban Studies and Regional Studies.\u000d\u000a      Lawless (1988-present, Professor) has played an overarching role, working\u000d\u000a      with Gordon Dabinett (senior lecturer, left for Sheffield University\u000d\u000a      2002), Elaine Batty (1999 - present, Research Fellow), Christina Beatty\u000d\u000a      (1992-present, Professor since 2012), and Ian Wilson (2004 - present,\u000d\u000a      Research Fellow). A number of grants supported this work (G1-G5), although\u000d\u000a      the award of the national evaluation of the New Deal for Communities (NDC)\u000d\u000a      Programme (2001-2010) proved especially valuable in providing time and\u000d\u000a      resources through which to develop thinking (G6). Research has majored on\u000d\u000a      two inter-related themes. How can evaluations best identify the costs and\u000d\u000a      benefits of ABIs? Using this evidence on costs and benefits, how then can\u000d\u000a      the scale and nature of outcome change associated with regeneration\u000d\u000a      programmes best be explained?\u000d\u000a    First, there has been a long-standing debate as to how evaluations\u000d\u000a        should identify the costs and benefits associated with ABIs. Much of\u000d\u000a      the research undertaken over the last 30 years or so into this theme has\u000d\u000a      not been especially robust because of factors such as lack of longitudinal\u000d\u000a      evidence and any change data not reflecting the, often arbitrary,\u000d\u000a      boundaries of ABIs. However, research undertaken by this team sought to\u000d\u000a      instil rigour into the debate by looking to monetise all benefits arising\u000d\u000a      from regeneration schemes, particularly through the use of shadow pricing\u000d\u000a      methodologies (Ref 4). The NDC evaluation in particular generated\u000d\u000a      long-term change data for these 39 deprived English areas across outcomes\u000d\u000a      such as environmental perceptions, community attitudes, crime, education,\u000d\u000a      jobs and so on. Having individual-level data through time on change in\u000d\u000a      relation to quality of life and income for those continuing to live in\u000d\u000a      these NDC areas, meant it was then possible to employ shadow pricing\u000d\u000a      methods to monetise transitions from, say, being `not satisfied' to\u000d\u000a      `satisfied' with the area, and its environment. This is an important\u000d\u000a      innovation since regeneration schemes typically seek to improve\u000d\u000a      perceptions of areas, an objective which has previously proved impossible\u000d\u000a      to monetise.\u000d\u000a    Second, results from this monetisation of benefits, together with other\u000d\u000a      evidence from previous projects, helped the team to understand the\u000d\u000a        scale and nature of outcome change associated with regeneration\u000d\u000a      schemes (Refs 1, 2, 3, 5). Lawless was centrally involved in the\u000d\u000a      Department of the Environment, Transport and the Region's 2001 'Review of\u000d\u000a      the Evidence Base for Regeneration Policy and Practice (Dabinett, G,\u000d\u000a      Lawless, P, Rhodes J, and Tyler, P) which concluded that the then\u000d\u000a      evidence-base lacked rigour in relation to longer term outcomes associated\u000d\u000a      with regeneration programmes. One of the key objectives of the NDC\u000d\u000a      evaluation was therefore for the first time to establish, and to explain,\u000d\u000a      longer term change across a range of outcomes. This research concluded\u000d\u000a      that area-level change across these 39 areas through time proved\u000d\u000a      relatively limited, being largely restricted to more positive perceptions\u000d\u000a      on the part of residents towards their local area, its environment and\u000d\u000a      fear of crime. However, individuals who engaged with specific,\u000d\u000a      defined regeneration projects funded by NDCs saw much more positive change\u000d\u000a      than those not engaged, across a range of outcomes including health,\u000d\u000a      education and worklessness. However, this evidence pointing to\u000d\u000a      individual-level gains from regeneration projects was not picked up via\u000d\u000a      area-level household surveys. This was because in absolute terms\u000d\u000a      relatively few residents of these regeneration areas-each on average\u000d\u000a      accommodating around 10,000 people-directly benefited from NDC funded\u000d\u000a      projects. For instance, worklessness projects funded by NDCs might move a\u000d\u000a      small group of people into jobs, but these benefits would be insignificant\u000d\u000a      when compared with trends apparent within the wider labour market.\u000d\u000a    Because the NDC Programme placed a strong emphasis on involving local\u000d\u000a      residents in devising and implementing regeneration schemes, it was also\u000d\u000a      possible to establish the scale of outcomes associated with community\u000d\u000a        engagement initiatives (Ref 6). Research by the team highlighted the\u000d\u000a      complex nature of community engagement in regeneration schemes and the\u000d\u000a      limited scale of associated area-level outcome change in relation to key\u000d\u000a      indicators such as trust, social capital, networking, and involvement in\u000d\u000a      local decision making. But as with other outcomes, that relatively small\u000d\u000a      numbers of individuals living in NDC areas who became more directly\u000d\u000a      involved in community projects or who-say-served as community\u000d\u000a      representatives on NDC boards, tended to see more positive change in\u000d\u000a      relation to indicators such as trust than was the case for those more\u000d\u000a      distanced from the regeneration process.\u000d\u000a    Although the NDC Programme in particular provided a valuable laboratory\u000d\u000a      through which to develop research in relation to outcomes from\u000d\u000a      regeneration schemes, it is worth commenting that: policy reports have to\u000d\u000a      be in the public domain before academic papers can be published; the\u000d\u000a      relationship between research and impact is iterative not unilinear;\u000d\u000a      concern with area regeneration diminished following the change of\u000d\u000a      government in 2010; and the impacts of research on policy are often\u000d\u000a      indirect and time-delayed, rather than obvious and immediate.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4962","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research insights have had direct impacts on policy makers in central\u000a        government, virtually all of which occurred after 2007. However,\u000a      brief reference should be made of one key contextual development: the 2007\u000a      DCLG Select Committee on Coastal Towns. In its report, http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm200607\/cmselect\/cmcomloc\/351\/351.pdf\u000a      that Committee made 13 references to the evidence base in 'The Seaside\u000a        Economy' (Ref 4, G3), the key output from the ESRC funded\u000a      research on Seaside Towns. The DCLG Select Committee made two\u000a      recommendations which informed post 2007 impact.\u000a    First, the Committee recommended 'that the Government conducts an\u000a        immediate study on coastal tourism,' (p47 par 8) because \"seaside\u000a        towns are the least understood of Britain's problem areas\". In\u000a      response to this recommendation, in 2008 via its Neighbourhoods, Cities\u000a      and Regions Expert Panel, DCLG (S1) commissioned Fothergill to draft, 'England's\u000a        Coastal Towns: a short review of the issues, evidence base and research\u000a        needs'. That paper suggested various topics for further research.\u000a      Two of these, a statistical `benchmarking' study (G5, S1, S9), and a\u000a      report on tourism (G8, S2, S9), were subsequently commissioned from Beatty\u000a      and Fothergill. A further piece of research suggested by Fothergill's 2008\u000a      report, was undertaken by DWP in 2009. This involved an analysis of trends\u000a      in incapacity claimants in seaside towns, an exercise facilitated by the\u000a      use of the CRESR-developed ward-based definition of seaside towns (output\u000a      from G3, Refs 4,5) which Beatty and Fothergill licenced to DCLG for use\u000a      across all Government departments (S1).\u000a    Second, the 2007 Select Committee argued that Government needed to\u000a      appreciate the diverse needs of seaside towns. This recommendation\u000a      resulted in the 2008 commissioning by DCLG of a benchmarking study (G5,\u000a      S1), findings from which were presented (29\/7\/08) to the Whitehall cross-government\u000a\u0009  Coastal Towns Working Group comprising senior civil servants\u000a      with lead responsibility for coastal issues (S1,S6 par 7-9)). This led to\u000a      Beatty and Fothergill being commissioned to provide an evidence base on\u000a      smaller seaside towns (G7, S1, S6 par 61-63). Two further presentations\u000a      were made to the Coastal Towns Working Group (24\/11\/09) (G7,S6) and in\u000a      2010 (G8). Similarly two presentations were made to the Regional\u000a      Development Agencies' Coastal Areas Network on coastal communities\u000a      (26\/6\/08) (G7), and (7\/7\/10) (G8) and also to Welsh Government officials\u000a      (10\/6\/10) (G6). In turn the March 2010 CLG Update Note on Coastal\u000a        Towns (extract below from S6) documented the impact of the Beatty\u000a      and Fothergill Benchmarking study (G5, S1, S3, S4) and the subsequent\u000a      commissioning of G7:\u000a    \u000a      England's Seaside Towns &#8212; A 'Benchmarking' Study published by CLG\u000a          in 2008 has been well received. The study helped to fill the evidence\u000a          gap that existed on seaside towns. It reveals that the nature and\u000a          extent of the challenges faced by seaside towns vary considerably from\u000a          one location to another......... The study is helpful to local\u000a          authorities covered in the report, as evidence for developing their\u000a          community plans and priorities.\u000a       \u000a      A benchmarking study of smaller coastal towns (below 10,000\u000a          population) funded jointly by CLG, Defra and the Commission for Rural\u000a          Communities has been commissioned. It will report in Spring 2010.'\u000a    \u000a    The DCLG press release (S7) (4\/3\/11) accompanying the launch of the\u000a      subsequent smaller seaside towns research (Par 63 S5 above,G7, S1)\u000a      included a statement from Secretary of State, Eric Pickles MP:\u000a    'A new report by Sheffield Hallam University on small seaside towns,\u000a        paints a compelling picture of economic and social challenges,\u000a        enterprise and resilience over the last decade.' 'Mr Pickles\u000a        believes today's report underlines the need for a new approach to\u000a        coastal resorts, which have growth potential that needs to be harnessed\u000a        locally.'\u000a    The Secretary of State was also quoted in the press release:\u000a    \"Today's report paints a picture of resilience and enterprise in rural\u000a        seaside towns, despite missing out on the London centric growth and\u000a        prosperity of the past decade.\" \"Small coastal resorts have shown they\u000a        can build stronger, more diverse economies when given the chance.\"\u000a    Informed by evidence developed by Beatty and Fothergill, the Coalition\u000a      Government's new approach to seaside towns, was announced on 22\/7\/11 with\u000a      the creation of a Coastal Communities Fund, worth approximately &#163;25m a\u000a      year. Fothergill was subsequently invited to a ministerial seminar on\u000a      coastal towns (11\/7\/12), at which the CRESR studies were the only academic\u000a      studies alluded to by the Secretary of State in his opening remarks (S1).\u000a      Moreover, Government Policy Statements supporting economic development\u000a      projects in coastal and seaside areas (23\/8\/13) (S8) used the 2008 Beatty\u000a      and Fothergill benchmarking study (G5) as background evidence supporting\u000a      the policy decision to develop the Coastal Communities Fund.\u000a    Paralleling this impact on government policy, research insights have also\u000a      informed and benefited broader political debate (S9) by providing\u000a      evidence on the needs of seaside towns. The tourism report (G8, Ref 6) was\u000a      quoted by several MPs including John Penrose MP for Weston-Super-Mare\u000a      (Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Culture, Olympics, Media and\u000a      Sport) (S9) (25\/6\/10). Subsequently, Fothergill was invited by Mark\u000a      Simmonds, MP for Boston and Skegness, to address MPs in the Conservative\u000a      Coastal Towns Group (7\/7\/10) with regard to evidence on seaside towns\u000a      (G5-8). In addition, the tourism, (G8) and the benchmarking, studies\u000a      (G5,G7), were quoted extensively by five different MPs - including the\u000a      minister responding on behalf of government - in the Parliament\u000a      Adjournment Debate on Coastal Towns (S9) (20\/7\/10). Media coverage\u000a      resulting from G9 also focused on the finding that some seaside towns had\u000a      been particularly badly hit by welfare reforms, with research findings\u000a      also eliciting a response from the Prime Minister (S10).\u000a    Finally, research insights have had an impact on policy development\u000a        within seaside towns. Since 2008, presentations have been given at\u000a      four Annual Conferences of British Destinations (formerly BRADA) (S2)\u000a      representing local authorities (S3) and trade bodies in seaside towns,\u000a      Coastnet (2009), and the Local Government Association tourism and leisure\u000a      network (2010). The Coastal Regeneration Handbook, published in\u000a      2010 by the Coastal Communities Alliance (S3), which lobbies on behalf of\u000a      seaside towns, gives 14 references to this CRESR research programme. The\u000a      research team was also commissioned by the South East Local Enterprise\u000a      Partnership (S5) to provide an evidence base for SE coastal communities\u000a      which was disseminated at a seminar (12\/9\/12) attended by thirty\u000a      representatives from local authorities around the SE coast. This\u000a      culminated in further research in 2013 setting out ten priorities for the\u000a      region's coastal communities (S5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Traditionally seaside towns have been one of the least understood of\u000a      Britain's `problem areas'.

This work\u000a      was largely funded through a 2001 Economic and Social Research Council\u000a      (ESRC) grant: Unemployment and the labour market in Britain's seaside\u000a        towns (G3, Refs 4, 5), which was in turn co-financed by four\u000a      local authorities and the Housing Corporation. Nine follow-on studies were\u000a      subsequently commissioned by central and local government. Research was\u000a      undertaken because of the marked lack of evidence in relation to the\u000a      evolving economic and social fortunes of seaside towns. Four key research\u000a      insights emerged.\u000a    First, methodological advances allowed for fuller investigations of\u000a      labour market change. In particular, in 2001 the researchers developed a\u000a      new ward-based definition of the 43 principal seaside towns, unlocking\u000a      opportunities to analyse data on each, through time. Subsequently, the\u000a      Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), Welsh Government\u000a      and local partners commissioned the team to expand this research to\u000a      include smaller settlements (121 in total), such that by 2010\u000a      socio-economic and statistical profiles were available for all Britain's\u000a      seaside towns (G5, G6, G7).\u000a    Second, this ward-based geography facilitated the production of 'labour\u000a      market accounts' for each seaside town documenting the inter-related roles\u000a      of employment change, migration, commuting, economic inactivity,\u000a      population growth, and unemployment in explaining change from the early\u000a      1970s through to the mid-2000s. This work built on previous research by\u000a      Beatty and Fothergill into 'labour market accounting' techniques\u000a      undertaken as part of an ESRC funded study into adjustment in former\u000a      coalfield areas (G1, Ref 1). Research on seaside towns also built on\u000a      survey designs, estimation techniques, and theoretical frameworks which\u000a      emerged from a GB-wide investigation into `hidden unemployment' (G2, Refs\u000a      2, 3).\u000a    Third, for the first time research generated robust estimates across\u000a      seaside towns of employment supported through tourism by utilising\u000a      sophisticated benchmarking techniques. Previously, employment in the\u000a      tourism sector was hidden in statistics which incorporated such jobs\u000a      within the larger category of 'employment supported by local consumer\u000a      spending' (G8, Ref 6).\u000a    Fourth, the resultant evidence base, including a survey of 1,200\u000a      non-employed residents in seaside towns G3, Refs 4,5), underpinned a\u000a      series of overarching conceptual and policy conclusions. Research findings\u000a      showed most seaside towns were growing in terms of population and\u000a      employment, contrary to the myth that foreign holidays had undermined\u000a      their economic rationale. Unemployment affecting a number of seaside towns\u000a      was attributable not so much to local economic factors, but rather to high\u000a      in-migration, often driven by housing-related factors and the\u000a      benefits-system. Moreover, research insights dispelled the idea that\u000a      seaside towns were broadly similar in terms of socio-economic\u000a      characteristics and trends: evidence pointed to considerable diversity.\u000a      These overarching conclusions in turn informed, and were further\u000a      developed, in a number of wider-ranging studies by the team. These\u000a      included Beatty and Fothergill building on the theoretical framework and\u000a      methodologies deployed in the seaside towns research (G3), and also\u000a      earlier research (G2), to co-develop and secure as co-applicants an ESRC\u000a      funded study examining the growth of incapacity benefits amongst women\u000a      (G4). As part of this study Beatty and Fothergill in turn secured\u000a      additional co-funding of &#163;295,000 from other local partners including\u000a      three seaside towns' case study areas: Blackpool, Great Yarmouth, and East\u000a      Lindsey. Outputs by Beatty and Fothergill included individual reports for\u000a      each seaside town and a survey dataset of 1,100 Incapacity Benefit\u000a      claimants in these three towns. In addition, the 2013 report 'Hitting\u000a        the poorest places hardest: the local and regional impact of welfare\u000a        reform' (G9), highlighted the extent to which districts such as\u000a      Blackpool, Thanet, Hastings and Great Yarmouth were being especially\u000a      hard-hit by welfare reforms.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4963","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research insights impacted on policy within the two themes outlined in\u000a      Section 2. Key beneficiaries were central government, devolved\u000a      administrations and other regional and local agencies. First, knowledge\u000a        regarding the rationales and challenges of implementing the cohesion\u000a        agenda and an understanding of factors limiting its effectiveness\u000a      (Refs 1, 2), informed a series of evaluations and the provision of\u000a        advice and guidance to policy. An evaluation of the role of housing\u000a      in promoting community cohesion as part of the National Evaluation of\u000a      Housing Market Renewal (2009), explored Pathfinder approaches to\u000a      mainstreaming cohesion, which revealed a lack of understanding about what\u000a      community cohesion was and what Pathfinders should be aspiring to achieve.\u000a      In response, recommendations and guidance on good practice were provided,\u000a      and fed back to Pathfinders through personal communication in a bid to\u000a      prompt improvements in policy and practice. In turn these were\u000a      disseminated nationally in a Department for Communities and Local\u000a      Government (DCLG) published report (Housing Renewal and Community\u000a      Cohesion, 2009), which secured coverage in the professional press (Inside\u000a      Housing 28\/10\/09, Regeneration and Renewal 2\/11\/09). Subsequently,\u000a      Robinson and colleagues were commissioned by the Bridging Newcastle\u000a      Gateshead (BNG) Pathfinder to conduct research and to develop a strategy\u000a      for promoting cohesion in meeting housing needs through housing market\u000a      renewal (G4). Delivery of this contract involved the provision of advice\u000a      to BNG officers on an on-going basis about how to open up new housing\u000a      opportunities to different ethnic groups and to manage the cohesion\u000a      challenges that might ensue. In a report to the Audit Commission, the\u000a      strategy produced by CRESR was credited by BNG with helping to ensure that\u000a      housing market renewal responded to the needs of all groups within the\u000a      pathfinder area and in promoting cohesion (S6).\u000a    Research insights also enhanced development and delivery of the Welsh\u000a      Government's community cohesion strategy. Robinson and colleagues were\u000a      commissioned to evaluate the national cohesion strategy for Wales (G10).\u000a      Regular feedback, recommendations and guidance were provided to civil\u000a      servants in the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Division during the two\u000a      years of the evaluation through numerous feedback and briefing sessions at\u000a      Welsh Government offices. Recommendations directly informed Ministerial\u000a      decisions about the future direction of policy. For example, the\u000a      evaluation raised concerns about a lack of strategic thinking and limited\u000a      attention to mainstreaming among local authorities. In response, the Welsh\u000a      Government promoted the development of local strategies and funded the\u000a      appointment of a network of dedicated cohesion officers across Wales\u000a      charged with promoting collaborative working and in mainstreaming the\u000a      cohesion agenda (S1). CRESR was also commissioned to author guidance on\u000a      mainstreaming cohesion for local authorities, which was published by the\u000a      Welsh Government (S8). As part of the evaluation of the national strategy,\u000a      the CRESR team also provided the Welsh Government with detailed advice\u000a      about how to measure cohesion and specific advice regarding cohesion\u000a      questions to be included in the Living in Wales survey. Robinson also\u000a      authored guidance on community profiling and tension monitoring, designed\u000a      to enhance the practice of local authorities in Wales. This was launched\u000a      by the Minister in 2011, forwarded to all local authorities in a bid to\u000a      support good practice, and made available as a free download on the Welsh\u000a      Government's website (S8). This built on research exploring determinants\u000a      of community relations in the context of new migration (G11), and applied\u000a      research testing techniques for promoting engagement between long-\u000a      standing and newly arrived residents in Bradford (G8). The impact of this\u000a      work is confirmed by the comment from a senior civil servant in the Fairer\u000a      Futures Division of Welsh Government that this body of work was \"influential\u000a        in the development of a model in Wales of Regional Community Cohesion\u000a        Co-ordinators...to mainstream work on community cohesion. Further\u000a        recommendations from the evaluation have ensured that there is a key\u000a        focus on the delivery of community cohesion in Wales, where a renewed\u000a        action plan is being developed in 2013. The guidance has ensured that\u000a        Co-ordinators are delivering work consistently, with coverage across all\u000a        22 local authorities in Wales\" (S1).\u000a    Second, research insights played an important role in informing the\u000a        terms and influencing popular and political perspectives about one\u000a      of the most divisive issues associated with new migration: access to\u000a        social housing. Empirical insights into the housing experiences of\u000a      new migrants (Refs 4,5) and quantitative analysis of the profile of A8\u000a      migrants in social housing in England (S5), were referenced in a report on\u000a      housing allocations to the Migration Impacts Forum (2008), a government\u000a      convened group exploring the local level impacts of migration. The\u000a      professional journal 'Inside Housing' drew on these findings to challenge\u000a      comments by the Margaret Hodge MP about migrants living in social housing\u000a      (S6). Subsequently, Robinson was commissioned by the Local Government\u000a      Association (LGA) to deliver one of three pieces of analysis examining\u000a      whether there was any validity in the contention that recent migrants had\u000a      received preferential treatment in social housing allocations (S7). This\u000a      evidence informed the letter subsequently sent by the LGA to all local\u000a      authority chief executives in England clarifying the facts about the\u000a      allocation of housing to migrants (08\/04\/08). Research in the field also\u000a      led to invitations to briefings and presentations challenging thinking and\u000a      policy. Examples include briefings to: civil servants in DCLG and the Home\u000a      Office (30\/01\/08); practitioners and policy officers from local\u000a      authorities on the Yorkshire Migration Partnership (25\/03\/11); and the\u000a      first meeting of the Housing and Migration Network, which brought together\u000a      policy makers and practitioners to develop ideas for improving the housing\u000a      of refugees and new migrants (15\/10\/09).\u000a    Findings emerging from five evaluation reports (2010-2012) into the\u000a      effectiveness and efficiencies of local and national initiatives\u000a      supporting the integration of refugees (G9), helped the Home Office to\u000a      deliver on its obligation to evaluate and to learn from, European Refugee\u000a      Fund and European Integration Fund initiatives and to share such insights\u000a      with other EU states (S2). Key insights from research also informed Home\u000a      Office understanding of the impacts of migration and options for\u000a      monitoring these effects through Robinson's membership of a Home Office\u000a      expert panel on the impacts of migration on public services in England\u000a      (2012). Other contributions include a presentation on the local impacts of\u000a      migration to an invited audience of 30+ government policy makers, civil\u000a      servants and voluntary and community sector interests, as part of the\u000a      Westminster Breakfast Briefings series on migration convened by the\u000a      University of Oxford, discussing topical, cutting edge research on\u000a      migration related issues (22\/06\/12). In 2013, Robinson was recruited to\u000a      provide expertise on housing, migration and cohesion to the Homes and\u000a      Communities Agency's (HCA's) Equalities and Diversity Advisory Group,\u000a      which advises and challenges the HCA on all aspects of its work.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Community cohesion emerged as a distinct policy agenda in the aftermath\u000a      of the 2001 disturbances in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham and was\u000a      subsequently shaped by events including the London bombings of 2005 and\u000a      large-scale migration from the EU and beyond.

This research was supported by 13\u000a      research grants secured from research councils, charities and government\u000a      bodies. All research was undertaken in CRESR. The grant holder for all\u000a      projects was Robinson (1997-present, Professor since 2005). Other Category\u000a      A staff involved were Casey (2004-present, Senior Lecturer), Flint\u000a      (Professor, left for University of Sheffield 2011), Platts-Fowler\u000a      (Research Fellow, left for University of Leeds 2012), Reeve (2000-present,\u000a      Senior Research Fellow) and Wilson (2004-present, Research Fellow).\u000a      Research has focused on two related themes: policy understanding and\u000a      implementation of the cohesion agenda; and migration and cohesion.\u000a    First, research has addressed the question of how policy is interpreting\u000a        and implementing the cohesion agenda (Refs 1, 2, 3; Grants 1, 2, 4,\u000a      6, 9, 10). The underpinning body of research includes the first ever study\u000a      exploring links between community cohesion and housing (G1). This study\u000a      examined understandings and interpretations of the agenda among\u000a      practitioners in England through semi-structured interviews and a cohesion\u000a      impact assessment of policy and practice across the social rented sector.\u000a      These findings provided the basis for original analysis exploring the\u000a      rationale, understandings and implementation of the cohesion agenda in\u000a      England (Ref 1). The fundamental pillars that the agenda was built on were\u000a      identified and subject to scrutiny for the first time. A reliance on\u000a      contested notions of community and multiculturalism and presumptions about\u000a      the motives and behaviours of certain groups in society was revealed,\u000a      raising critical questions about the policy programme, thus scoping a new\u000a      academic research agenda. The means and mechanisms through which agencies\u000a      can promote cohesion were disclosed and factors with the potential to\u000a      undermine positive outcomes detailed (Ref 1, 2). This underpinning body of\u000a      research also includes the first study exploring predictors of community\u000a      cohesion among young people (Ref 3). This involved statistical modelling\u000a      of data from the Longitudinal Survey of Young People in England to fill a\u000a      gap in knowledge about factors informing variations in cohesion among\u000a      young people, as part of which new measures of cohesion were developed.\u000a      Predictors of cohesion among young people were found to overlap with those\u000a      within the adult population (deprivation, perceptions of crime), but to\u000a      also include distinctive features relating to social and ethnic mix within\u000a      school populations, and the individual situations of young people.\u000a    Second, a specific strand of analysis focusing on migration and\u000a        cohesion emerged from this portfolio of research on cohesion.\u000a      Migration emerged as a key factor informing cohesion at the local level.\u000a      Dominant discourses served to pit migrants against British citizens, thus\u000a      working to raise community tensions. Research ventured beyond this\u000a      stereotyping and scape-goating to expose the experiences and consequences\u000a      of migration for new and settled populations and for community relations.\u000a      This included a focus on the frequently debated issue of access to housing\u000a      for new immigrants (Refs 4, 5 and Grants 5, 7, 8). Analysis highlighted\u000a      how the rapid pace of change driven by new migration posed real challenges\u000a      for the housing system, but also revealed moral panics surrounding migrant\u000a      access to social housing had little or no association with a clear,\u000a      apparent and rational threat (Ref 5). Indeed, the first exploration of\u000a      housing pathways for new migrants revealed that, far from being skilled\u000a      players of the British welfare state, migrants were frequently unaware of\u000a      possibilities provided by the social rented sector (Ref 4). This strand of\u000a      work also involved a leading contribution to efforts designed to fill gaps\u000a      in knowledge and understanding about the local effects of new migration.\u000a      Robinson and Reeve authored the first review of the evidence base on\u000a      neighbourhood experiences of new immigration for the Joseph Rowntree\u000a      Foundation (Grant 3). Subsequently, a programme of work explored the\u000a      integration of new migrants in the UK, through in-depth, qualitative\u000a      analysis of migration experiences and an evaluation of initiatives\u000a      promoting integration (Grants 8, 9, 11). Drawing on these empirical\u000a      insights, a conceptual framework was developed to support explorations\u000a      into the neighbourhood effects of new immigration (Ref 6). This approach\u000a      recognised that migration could be a driver of change at the local level,\u000a      but its consequences were often more complex and varied than commonly\u000a      assumed, not least because place both informed, and was in turn influenced\u000a      by, new immigration.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8528","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Following the developmental research and its dissemination though\u000d\u000a      non-academic conferences (e.g. Moore 2010b) the PPDS framework is now part\u000d\u000a      of the international benchmarking and certification EarthCheck EC3\u000d\u000a      programme (Source 5.1) and is applied globally (examples given in Sources\u000d\u000a      5.2, 5.3). EarthCheck is the world's largest certifier of sustainable\u000d\u000a      travel and tourism operators, having more than 1000 clients in over 60\u000d\u000a      countries. The programme provides benchmarking, certification and\u000d\u000a      performance improvement systems to help businesses improve profitability\u000d\u000a      and operational efficiencies. Published case studies have been used to\u000d\u000a      challenge, develop and improve internationally accepted sustainability\u000d\u000a      indicators. These indicators are used in the design process, project\u000d\u000a      planning, and management activities across a wide range of mixed- use\u000d\u000a      precincts, communities and tourist resorts. PPDS is now in commercial use.\u000d\u000a      The PPDS framework has provided a means to overcome on-going impacts\u000d\u000a      including environmental vulnerability (Source 5.4) over-exploitation,\u000d\u000a      energy dependency, population loss, social depredation, debt, and economic\u000d\u000a      volatility.\u000d\u000a    Discussions between EarthCheck and Royal Thai Government officials and\u000d\u000a      representatives of Pattaya City Thailand have taken place to further\u000d\u000a      exploit the success of the PPDS framework system. Both were seeking to\u000d\u000a      improve the quality of life in one of the notorious tourist areas where\u000d\u000a      exploitation of young women and boys employed in the sex trade had become\u000d\u000a      rife. The discussions have led to the development of an international\u000d\u000a      consortium incorporating SMEs and local Authorities from Asian countries\u000d\u000a      including Indonesia and Malaysia. The primary aim of the collaborations is\u000d\u000a      to seek to address the issues of disparity and promote strategies for the\u000d\u000a      creation of sustainable process-based supply chains using process-based\u000d\u000a      framework systems.\u000d\u000a    The PPDS framework, along with the related tool Building Planning and\u000d\u000a      Design Standard (BPDS) arising from this research are now being utilised\u000d\u000a      to offer a means by which major refurbishment of listed buildings in\u000d\u000a      cities can be undertaken in a sustainable and ecologically sensitive\u000d\u000a      manner (Source 5.5). For example, the City of Melbourne's Tourism\u000d\u000a      Environmental Action Plan 2009 - 2013 addresses the challenge of growing\u000d\u000a      tourism demands in the City. Challenges include increased tourism activity\u000d\u000a      that puts pressure on the environment by consuming increased resources and\u000d\u000a      energy whilst generating increased waste and carbon emissions. A feature\u000d\u000a      of the City's governance is that its hotels now achieve accreditation\u000d\u000a      using this internationally recognised system. EarthCheck Pty, who advised\u000d\u000a      and created the vision for the promotional organisation Destination\u000d\u000a      Melbourne, recommends the PPDS framework and standards. Whilst recognising\u000d\u000a      that tourism underpins the socio-economic wellbeing of Melbourne by\u000d\u000a      generating more than $10 billion in expenditure and employing 160,000\u000d\u000a      people, this cannot override the principles of sustainable development.\u000d\u000a      The sustainability achieved using the PPDS and BPDS framework standards at\u000d\u000a      the Rialto Hotel Melbourne (Moore, 2010a) has led to their prescription as\u000d\u000a      voluntary regulatory frameworks for use on precinct and building\u000d\u000a      proposals, including heritage buildings, in Melbourne City business\u000d\u000a      district. The evidence from the Rialto case study indicates that these\u000d\u000a      standards offer the potential of lower environmental and social impacts\u000d\u000a      along with lower life cycle costs and higher returns on investment\u000d\u000a      capital.\u000d\u000a    Early research showed that many developing countries and small island\u000d\u000a      states in the Australasia region have experienced some of the largest\u000d\u000a      increases in world tourism demand. Furthermore, travel and tourism provide\u000d\u000a      a means of socio-economic restructuring. PPDS has led to extensive\u000d\u000a      elimination or mitigation of the negative ecological impacts linked to\u000d\u000a      tourism and its accompanying resort development and on-going facility\u000d\u000a      management. The successful utilisation of the Framework is now being\u000d\u000a      extended to a major regional governmental undertaking in Thailand where\u000d\u000a      the City of Pattaya, through the Mayor's office, is to use PPDS processes\u000d\u000a      to interconnect and drive the redevelopment of the regional travel and\u000d\u000a      tourism industry.\u000d\u000a    The PPDS approach is being further deployed by a SwitchAsia funding bid\u000d\u000a      by the Unit, supported by Thailand's Designated Areas for Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Tourism Administration (DASTA). DASTA is a national government\u000d\u000a      organisation headed by the Prime Minister of Thailand in consortium with\u000d\u000a      EarthCheck Pty; the founding member of this alliance of government,\u000d\u000a      industry and research organisations. The project develops the PPDS themes\u000d\u000a      to revitalise impoverished precincts to become good places to live, raise\u000d\u000a      families, retire to or simply visit. The design-brief to end-user\u000d\u000a      philosophy of PPDS will encourage respect for the environment and its\u000d\u000a      bio-diversity within new or refurbished development projects.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study presents a dynamic development framework route-map (the\u000d\u000a      Precinct Planning Design Standard, PPDS) that enhances sustainability and\u000d\u000a      the delivery of a development's goals, aims, and objectives for\u000d\u000a      medium-large mixed-use precinct developments and tourist resorts in\u000d\u000a      developing countries.

Exemplar projects include the Rise Noosa and\u000d\u000a      Salt precincts in Australia, Alila Resorts at Uluwatu and Soori Bali in\u000d\u000a      Indonesia, Hilton Hadahaa Island in the Maldives, and Banyan Tree's Laguna\u000d\u000a      Lang Company, in Vietnam. During the developmental research, the Precinct\u000d\u000a      Planning Design Standard (PPDS) was used as a sustainability modelling\u000d\u000a      tool for the Australian State Government regulated, ecologically\u000d\u000a      sensitive, United Nation biosphere area at Lake Weyba Noosa on the\u000d\u000a      Sunshine Coast of Queensland Australia. PPDS provided greater certainty\u000d\u000a      regarding predicted long term ecological performance improvements on this\u000d\u000a      high profile ecologically sensitive project.\u000d\u000a    Moore (2010b) identified an early research focus on a process-based\u000d\u000a      framework for delivering sustainable development for travel and tourism\u000d\u000a      infrastructure in coastal, rural, or urban regions. He reviewed\u000d\u000a      environmental, social and economic policy and strategies being pursued by\u000d\u000a      international, national, state, region and local level and how they\u000d\u000a      translate into the regulatory and development process. He also analysed\u000d\u000a      existing statutory regulation and its integration of sustainable\u000d\u000a      principles into the development approval process. Additionally, his\u000d\u000a      research reviews and critiques existing sustainable models and tools and\u000d\u000a      how they interface with the regulatory process. Linking the proposed\u000d\u000a      performance based integrated process framework and its models and tools to\u000d\u000a      the development approval process, Moore determined the barriers to the\u000d\u000a      implementation of sustainable principles on medium to large mixed use\u000d\u000a      precinct developments. Through case studies, Moore tested the framework,\u000d\u000a      models and tools using several medium to large mixed use precinct\u000d\u000a      developments to determine how good intent translates to actual\u000d\u000a      performance.\u000d\u000a    The framework developed into the fully integrated PPDS tool incorporating\u000d\u000a      planning and design, construction management, and facility operations. It\u000d\u000a      integrates the development process with ecological assessments for medium\u000d\u000a      to large mixed-use precincts in one management tool. This helps clients,\u000d\u000a      stakeholders and professional advisors, particularly the development\u000d\u000a      manager, achieve goals brought on by ever-increasing sustainability\u000d\u000a      demands and delivery pressures. PPDS meets industry demands to mitigate\u000d\u000a      ecological impact.\u000d\u000a    Moore (2011) shows that existing development standards and tools adopt\u000d\u000a      principles that define sustainable planning, design, and construction, but\u000d\u000a      have only limited references to pre-development and operational needs.\u000d\u000a      PPDS, however, (Moore, 2012) gives full regard to post-construction\u000d\u000a      management and performance measurement. These two major omissions,\u000d\u000a      pre-PPDS, indicate deficiencies in key standards such as the\u000d\u000a      sustainability protocols existing as the Building Research Establishment\u000d\u000a      Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) (UK), the Leadership in Energy\u000d\u000a      and Environmental Design (LEED) (United States of America) and GreenStar\u000d\u000a      (Australia). Sustainability principles were rarely initial or ultimate\u000d\u000a      project objectives; projects merely responded to statutory authority\u000d\u000a      requirements and only included environmental imperatives. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      earlier standards are limited by their assumptions about pre-determined\u000d\u000a      site choice: the PPDS development tool incorporates early pre-planning and\u000d\u000a      design phases of the development process. The development industry\u000d\u000a      commonly separates construction and management (Moore, 2010a) leading to\u000d\u000a      many of the industry's delivery problems such as poor quality, over-spend\u000d\u000a      and poor programmed performance. Whilst pre-PPDS standards follow and\u000d\u000a      perpetuate this unsatisfactory disconnection, PPDS provides a fully\u000d\u000a      integrated design-brief to end-user approach. The Unit's on-going\u000d\u000a      research, further refining the PPDS, explores how to disseminate the\u000d\u000a      benefits of the framework approach into industry process and practice.\u000d\u000a      This includes mechanisms by which institutional, social and regulatory\u000d\u000a      barriers are overcome.\u000d\u000a    Initial research was funded in 2006 by the Australian Government and\u000d\u000a      Earthcheck Pty at the University of Queensland, where Moore was then\u000d\u000a      employed.

The conceptual model demonstrated potential for\u000d\u000a      significant energy saving in buildings from adaptive human environmental\u000d\u000a      behaviour. The increasing concerns about global warming in the 1990s\u000d\u000a      elevated the global recognition of the model, because of its potential to\u000d\u000a      reduce `greenhouse gas' emissions.\u000d\u000a    More recently the Thermal Comfort Unit at Brookes has developed the\u000d\u000a      conceptual foundation of the adaptive model. It has designed and conducted\u000d\u000a      field-experiments to acquire data quantifying thermal comfort in daily\u000d\u000a      life to measure the thermal environment in buildings, and observe the\u000d\u000a      occupants' thermal behaviour.\u000d\u000a    Co-operation with overseas research teams has led to the acquisition of\u000d\u000a      data from a wide range of climates and cultures around the world. In\u000d\u000a      cooperation with the Low Energy Architecture Research Unit of London\u000d\u000a      Metropolitan University, the Unit organised the influential series of\u000d\u000a      international Windsor conferences on thermal comfort and energy use in\u000d\u000a      buildings. Since 1994 these conferences have been instrumental in building\u000d\u000a      an informal international network of practitioners and researchers who\u000d\u000a      have further advanced the adaptive approach to comfort, both through the\u000d\u000a      collection of data worldwide, and the development and extension of models\u000d\u000a      of human thermal behaviour in buildings.\u000d\u000a    The research projects of the Thermal Comfort Unit have included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Field experiments in Pakistan to provide climate-related national\u000d\u000a        guidelines for temperatures in buildings.\u000d\u000a      Year-round field experiments in offices in England (Oxford) and\u000d\u000a        Scotland (Aberdeen) to establish the dynamic relation between changes in\u000d\u000a        outdoor temperature and changes in comfortable temperatures indoors.\u000d\u000a      Leading data-acquisition year-round field experiments in five European\u000d\u000a        countries (France, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, and UK) to form a\u000d\u000a        pan-European database.

Essentially, populations can\u000d\u000a      successfully adapt to become comfortable at widely differing indoor\u000d\u000a      temperatures. The results also showed that the temperature for comfort in\u000d\u000a      a building could be linked to the outdoor temperature by an exponentially\u000d\u000a      weighted running mean of the daily mean outdoor temperatures.\u000d\u000a    The weighting coefficient (alpha) of the exponential series was\u000d\u000a      quantified from the field databases and found to be in the region of\u000d\u000a      0.8\/day.

From 2007 onwards, Green Guide rated materials\u000d\u000a      have had to be specified as part of the Code for Sustainable Homes\u000d\u000a      standards which are now required in order for any new residential\u000d\u000a      development in the UK to be granted Planning Permission. Green Guide is\u000d\u000a      also cited in the UK Government's Homes and Communities (HCA) Quality\u000d\u000a      Standards (2007) and is the official UK Government Buying Standard for all\u000d\u000a      construction products.\u000d\u000a    Government Buildings\u000d\u000a      In 2009, the Government stipulated that all of their publicly owned\u000d\u000a      property should attain maximum Green Guide materials credits in order to\u000d\u000a      achieve the BREEAM `Excellent' standard required of all new government\u000d\u000a      buildings.\u000d\u000a    UK Local Authorities\u000d\u000a      Greener construction materials offer many human health and welfare\u000d\u000a      benefits in terms of using safer, less polluting, lower atmospheric\u000d\u000a      emission producing materials. As a result of Green Guide being able to\u000d\u000a      measure and compare materials against these issues, many UK Local\u000d\u000a      Authorities have published design guides using Green Guide as a green\u000d\u000a      standard for all housing and commercial construction projects requiring\u000d\u000a      Planning Permission and Building Regulations. For example, in the London\u000d\u000a      Mayor's, Greater London Authority (GLA) Planning Guidance notes, it is\u000d\u000a      stated that that no high embodied impact materials shall be used \"...as\u000d\u000a      defined by the summary ratings set out in The Green Guide to\u000d\u000a      Specification.\" (GLA, 2006; pp 37-38). The GLA design guide also uses\u000d\u000a      Green Guide to set standards for the use of timber, insulation and the use\u000d\u000a      of recycled materials. Similarly, Green Guide is the key reference text\u000d\u000a      for materials selection in many commercial developments such as the 1.9\u000d\u000a      million sq ft Westfield Shopping Centre in East London and other UK Local\u000d\u000a      Authority design guides including those cited below in Section 5: the\u000d\u000a      Borough of Islington, Kent County Council, North Devon (Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Construction Technical Appendix; : DVS1A and ECN15) &amp; Devon County\u000d\u000a      Council (Sustainable Design &amp; Construction Guide); Dundee (Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Development Guide for Construction), Fife, Bristol, Newcastle City Council\u000d\u000a      (Urban Design Guidance, 2010), Staffordshire, Glasgow, Edinburgh and\u000d\u000a      Oldham &amp; Rochdale.\u000d\u000a    International Standards\u000d\u000a      Green Guide has also provided a model and source of information across\u000d\u000a      many international jurisdictions as other countries have sought to develop\u000d\u000a      their own international standards for greener construction. BREEAM and\u000d\u000a      Green Guide ratings are used in many countries worldwide including France,\u000d\u000a      Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Poland and Germany and BREEAM is available in an\u000d\u000a      international version to meet this demand.\u000d\u000a    Materials Producers\u000d\u000a      Once Green Guide began to rate materials using an A* &#8212; E scoring system,\u000d\u000a      enabling property professionals to see and compare the environmental\u000d\u000a      impacts of products, it became possible (and a commercial imperative) for\u000d\u000a      materials producers to improve their environmental performance in order to\u000d\u000a      enhance their social and green credentials. For example, 2011 data shows\u000d\u000a      that the energy use for concrete production has fallen by around 11%\u000d\u000a      compared to the 2008 baseline. The concrete industry has become\u000d\u000a      increasingly active in the use of by-products, secondary materials and\u000d\u000a      material diverted from the waste stream to reduce its demands on primary\u000d\u000a      raw materials. The 2012 energy use target was achieved in 2010 when a\u000d\u000a      quarter of the energy used in the concrete industry came from material\u000d\u000a      derived from the waste stream (CPA, 2012). Although such behaviour change\u000d\u000a      is also attributable to rising energy costs and more stringent\u000d\u000a      legislation, the impact of Green Guide's rating system cannot be\u000d\u000a      underestimated as it has become a key part of their marketing campaigns.\u000d\u000a      Evidence of this can be seen in marketing material from the concrete\u000d\u000a      industry, roofing materials producers, aluminium manufacturers and the\u000d\u000a      producers of insulation materials (see Section 5 for examples).\u000d\u000a    A lasting legacy\u000d\u000a      The authors of Green Guide have produced a number of academic papers and\u000d\u000a      reports, helping to broaden the research community's understanding of the\u000d\u000a      environmental impacts of construction products. As stated in the London\u000d\u000a      Olympic Development Plan in which Green Guide was used as the key text in\u000d\u000a      determining the selection of construction materials, the challenge is to\u000d\u000a      continue to \"identify, source, and use environmentally and socially\u000d\u000a      responsible materials... a key aspect... of delivering sustainable\u000d\u000a      developments\" in order to leave \"a lasting social, economic and\u000d\u000a      environmental legacy...\" (ODA, 2007 &amp; 2009)\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Green Guide to Specification is an environmental profiling system\u000d\u000a      that enables designers and constructors to select building materials and\u000d\u000a      components which have the lowest environmental impact.

Prior to his work, no reliable method existed to evaluate and\u000d\u000a      compare the environmental impacts of construction materials. The Green\u000d\u000a      Guide measures the environmental impacts of each material or component, in\u000d\u000a      terms of their effect on climate change, resources use, water extraction,\u000d\u000a      wastes created, toxicity, ozone depletion, acidification and\u000d\u000a      Eutrophication. The quantitative `cradle-to-grave' Life Cycle Assessment\u000d\u000a      (LCA) data for each impact and for each material is collated by dividing\u000d\u000a      the overall range of values by six.

Yet the\u000d\u000a      construction and operation of new energy facilities can be very\u000d\u000a      controversial, especially for the host locality. Until recently much more\u000d\u000a      has been known about the local bio-physical impacts of such projects\u000d\u000a      rather than the socio-economic impacts. IAU research identifies the\u000d\u000a          nature of the local socio-economic impacts and approaches to\u000d\u000a          mitigate negative impacts and enhance positive impacts.\u000d\u000a    Power station facilities are large (covering 100s of hectares), employ\u000d\u000a      many people to build (typically over 5000 pa over an 8 year construction\u000d\u000a      period for a nuclear station) and are expensive (c&#163;14 billion for the new\u000d\u000a      twin-reactor nuclear power stations). IAU research has developed\u000d\u000a      operational models to explain the nature and key determinants of local\u000d\u000a      socio-economic impacts. It differentiates between impacts for different\u000d\u000a      `stages' in the life-cycle of the development, between social and economic\u000d\u000a      impacts, and also between actual and perceived impacts. The identified\u000d\u000a      impact categories are now widely used to structure major project\u000d\u000a      assessments.\u000d\u000a    The IAU has undertaken research and consultancy on major UK power station\u000d\u000a      developments over 30 years. This has included work on the various `types'\u000d\u000a      of developments (fossil-fuelled, nuclear and wind farms), and on the\u000d\u000a      various key `stages' in the project life-cycle (construction, operation\u000d\u000a      and decommissioning). Initial research, funded largely by the energy\u000d\u000a      industry (CEGB\/National Power\/ Nuclear Electric) in the 1980s\/1990s\u000d\u000a      developed `operational' models. A major step in the research programme was\u000d\u000a      the award of an applied research contract to the IAU to monitor the local\u000d\u000a      socio-economic impacts of building Sizewell B nuclear power station\u000d\u000a      (Suffolk) over the period 1988-1996 (National Power\/Nuclear Energy &#8212; c &#163;1\u000d\u000a      million). This is still the most recent nuclear power station built in the\u000d\u000a      UK. The IAU worked with many stakeholders (developer, local authorities,\u000d\u000a      local agencies such as health authorities, police, and the local community\u000d\u000a      &#8212; including local schools) to identify the range of local impacts, using a\u000d\u000a      wide range of quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings are\u000d\u000a      published in a set of `Annual Monitoring Reports' (1988-1996), plus\u000d\u000a      many related articles (see Section3). The Sizewell B monitoring studies\u000d\u000a      were invaluable in monitoring impacts, and managing them better, in the\u000d\u000a      Suffolk community.\u000d\u000a    The Sizewell B and other IAU studies (see Section 3) have provided\u000d\u000a      valuable empirical studies for developers and local decision makers in\u000d\u000a      assessing the likely impacts of new developments. During the 1990s and\u000d\u000a      2000s, IAU advised on\/researched the potential local socio-economic\u000d\u000a      impacts of: English gas-fired developments; various Scottish windfarms;\u000d\u000a      and nuclear decommissioning projects. In the period 2008-2013, the IAU has\u000d\u000a      assessed, for British Energy and EDF, the local socio-economic impacts of\u000d\u000a      the UK's new nuclear build programme. This initially involved studies at 4\u000d\u000a      sites, narrowing down to detailed studies which formed part of the EDF\u000d\u000a      application to PINS (2011) for consent to build Hinkley Point C, plus\u000d\u000a      consultation studies (2012) for building Sizewell C.

The following narrative presents selected\u000a      examples in support of these benefits.\u000a    Policies and Practice\u000a      In 2008, working in partnership with the GeoInformation&#174; Group,\u000a      DECoRuM research was used to provide carbon mapping services to UK local\u000a      authorities. Furthermore, principles of carbon counting research have\u000a      underpinned the development of several tools, protocols and practices.\u000a      Professor Gupta, drawing on his research expertise of DECoRuM, through his\u000a      role as technical advisor, contributed to UNEP's Global Common Carbon\u000a      Metric tool7 and protocol through the Sustainable Buildings and\u000a      Climate Initiative. The Common carbon metric protocol is currently being\u000a      developed as an ISO standard on carbon metric of building (ISO\/TC 59\/SC17)8.\u000a      Principles from carbon counting research have also been applied to\u000a      development of the world's first carbon neutrality standard, through\u000a      Professor Gupta's contributions as member of the steering committee, the\u000a      British Standards Institution's (BSI) `UKPAS 2060 Specification of the\u000a      demonstration of carbon neutrality' 9(taken up by nearly 100\u000a      organisations).\u000a    Community engagement\u000a      Through the EVALOC project4, DECoRuM incorporates a `community\u000a      energy monitoring toolkit', designed to present results on impacts and\u000a      effectiveness of low-carbon interventions. A `community engagement\u000a      toolkit' is also included which provides usable materials and guidance for\u000a      community energy projects: nationally through monitoring and evaluation of\u000a      six case study low carbon communities funded through the Department of\u000a      Energy and Climate Change's Low Carbon Communities Challenge programme;\u000a      and locally through the steering group membership of the Low Carbon Oxford\u000a      initiative since 201210.\u000a    More recently, through the DECC-funded Local Energy Assessment Fund\u000a      (2012)11, DECoRuM has enabled a local community in Bicester\u000a      (Oxfordshire, UK) to prepare for the National Green Deal programme, by\u000a      assessing the potential for applying costed refurbishment interventions\u000a      (packages) based on a combination of best practice energy saving measures,\u000a      and low carbon technologies. Findings from the DECoRuM-Bicester model have\u000a      been directly used to install cavity and wall insulation in 42 dwellings,\u000a      resulting in CO2 savings of least 50tCO2 per year. To share\u000a      insights from carbon counting research, since 2013 Gupta has been\u000a      appointed a steering group member of the Department of Energy and Climate\u000a      Change's English Housing Survey (EHS) Modelling project.\u000a    Future proofing and designing for the future\u000a      SNACC project assessed the risk of climate change driven overheating for\u000a      existing suburban homes5. The effectiveness ranking of\u000a      interventions for tackling overheating in homes6 have been\u000a      explicitly applied in Department for Communities and Local Governments\u000a      seminal report, published in 2012, `Investigation into overheating in\u000a      homes'13. The report, citing Professor Gupta's research\u000a      directly, identifies policy instruments to tackle future overheating in\u000a      new build (Building Regulations) and refurbishments (National Green Deal\u000a      advice). Furthermore, overheating findings from SNACC research project\u000a      have been taken up and disseminated through a National Overheating\u000a      Guidance note14 prepared by United Kingdom Climate Impact\u000a      Programme (on behalf of Department for Communities and Local Governments)\u000a      with endorsement from the Green Deal Oversight and Registration Body in\u000a      addition to Department for Energy and Climate Change. This guidance note\u000a      will be distributed to all Green Deal advisors and assessors. In addition\u000a      to these, UK's Adaptation and Resilience to a Changing Climate\u000a      Coordination Network (ARCC-CAN) has taken up SNACC's research findings on\u000a      overheating to produce a detailed guidance note to underpin the National\u000a      Overheating Guidance Note15.\u000a    Impacts from DECoRuM-adapt model are continuing to be realised through\u000a      Professor Gupta's continued engagement with industry and communities of\u000a      interest. Since 2010, the risk-based methodological approach developed in\u000a      the SNACC project has been successfully applied in five Technology\u000a      Strategy Board-funded `Design for future climate' projects with nationally\u000a      leading architectural practices and consultancies e.g. Farrells, BDP\u000a      Partnership, Medical architecture, Penoyre and Prasad LLP, and Ridge and\u000a      Partners. The projects have systematically evaluated, through downscaling\u000a      of UK climate change projections and simulation, the potential for\u000a      incorporating adaptation strategies for tackling overheating into live\u000a      designs of future low\/zero carbon homes, schools and hospitals in the UK.\u000a      In particular, findings from one of the Design for future climate project\u000a      on future-proofing NW Bicester eco-town, has led to the introduction of a\u000a      new local planning requirement for developers by Cherwell District\u000a      Council, related to testing of new housing for overheating in 2050s16.\u000a    Achieving real CO2 emission reductions\u000a      The approach of DECoRuM carbon counting research has also been applied in\u000a      advanced low carbon refurbishments of three TSB funded Retrofit for future\u000a      projects (by Oxford Brookes University) out of which one project (Oxford\u000a      Whole House Carbon Reduction) has achieved 80% carbon emission reductions\u000a      in reality (wide media coverage) and is the only case study profiled by\u000a      TSB in their Retrofitanalysis report17.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Gupta, an internationally recognised expert on architecture and\u000a      climate change, has developed an innovative software model for carbon\u000a      counting (DECoRuM&#174; model) and climate change adaptation (DECoRuM&#174; adapt)\u000a      of existing housing.

DECoRuM&#174; brings together\u000a      Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques (based on MapInfo GIS) and\u000a      BREDEM-12 energy model, to rapidly measure, model, map, manage and track\u000a      domestic CO2 emissions on a house-by house level, and also aggregate and\u000a      visualise results on an urban scale. The background calculations of\u000a      DECoRuM are performed by BREDEM-12 (Building Research Establishment's\u000a      Domestic Energy Model &#8212; BREDEM) and SAP 2009 (Standard Assessment\u000a      Procedure-SAP), both of which are dynamically linked to create the model\u000a      and perform the calculations. To inform the model, actual home\u000a      characteristics are gathered from historic and current maps, on-site\u000a      street survey, occupant questionnaires, and literature describing home\u000a      characteristics based on age and typology. Using such data reduction\u000a      techniques, DECoRuM is able to assess baseline energy usage and evaluate\u000a      energy savings, CO2 reductions and cost-effectiveness (using life-cycle\u000a      costing) of applying best practice energy efficiency strategies and\u000a      low\/zero carbon technologies in existing housing.\u000a    In 2006 DECoRuM&#174; was awarded proof of concept funding from SEEDA for its\u000a      further development; this required applying the model in the city of\u000a      Oxford and at Arizona State University with a view to their carbon\u000a      emission reduction. These studies demonstrated that by applying DECoRuM,\u000a      an estimate of the potential area-based level of CO2 reduction was\u000a      possible e.g. application of DECoRuM model to a case study in Oxford shows\u000a      that CO2 emission reductions above 60% are possible, at a cost of between\u000a      &#163;6 and &#163;77 per tonne of CO2 emissions saved, depending upon the package of\u000a      measures used and the scenario of capital costs (low or high) employed1.\u000a    An EPSRC CASE award2 (Robert Irving supervised by Professor\u000a      Gupta), enhanced the heat-pump sub-model of DECoRuM to assess the possible\u000a      effects of future domestic heat pump installations on the UK energy supply3.\u000a      Following on from this work, in 2010 through an ESRC-funded research grant4\u000a      `EVALOC project on evaluating low carbon communities', DECoRuM&#174; has\u000a      incorporated a `community energy monitoring toolkit' to track the impact\u000a      of community-led low carbon interventions on energy behaviours through\u000a      detailed long-term monitoring of energy use and environmental conditions\u000a      (visualised through maps).\u000a    The DECoRuM model has also been applied to climate change adaptation,\u000a      through the EPSRC-funded SNACC project5 which investigates how\u000a      existing suburban neighbourhoods in England can be `best' adapted to\u000a      reduce further impacts of climate change and withstand ongoing changes.\u000a      `DECoRuM-Adapt' toolkit was developed and tested to establish the impacts\u000a      of climate change on both winter heating demand and summer overheating\u000a      potential of existing suburban homes (in six suburban typologies across\u000a      Oxford, Stockport and Bristol). Probabilistic climate change projections\u000a      for 2030s and 2050s were used in dynamic thermal simulation (IES Apache\u000a      sim) to test the effectiveness of incremental adaptive retrofitting\u000a      packages in reducing future overheating risk in typical English home\u000a      archetypes. Using `DECoRuM-Adapt' these adaptation packages were further\u000a      evaluated in the six case study neighbourhoods across the three cities to\u000a      assist planners and policy-makers in assessing and preventing overheating\u000a      risk at a stock level. This showed that the existing housing stock must be\u000a      future-proofed for a warming climate, particularly through retrofit\u000a      programmes (e.g. the Green Deal) and any upgrading of building regulations6.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14222","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    It is vital to find ways to protect and pay for ecosystem services at a\u000a      time when Governments around the world are operating under tighter\u000a      economic constraints, and there is growing interest in Payment for\u000a      Ecosystem Service schemes internationally. Reed led the\u000a      development of a UK Peatland Code that could facilitate private investment\u000a      in peatland restoration, providing guidance and quality standards for\u000a      potential investors and for the landowners and managers who are paid to\u000a      restore peatlands. The Code gives corporations the opportunity to sponsor\u000a      UK-based projects linked to their brands as part of their Corporate Social\u000a      Responsibility portfolio, with the potential to turn these investments\u000a      into future assets if the Code becomes part of the Government's GHG\u000a      Accounting Guidelines (as the Woodland Carbon Code did), making it\u000a      possible to include GHG emission savings in corporate carbon accounting,\u000a      or if it becomes financially viable to trade the carbon on the\u000a      international voluntary carbon market. The Code also provides an\u000a      opportunity for landowners and managers to generate financial rewards from\u000a      restoration.\u000a    The Government's 2011 Natural Environment White Paper emphasised the\u000a      creation of new markets to pay for nature's services. It announced the\u000a      formation of Defra's Ecosystem Markets Taskforce, which was tasked with\u000a      identifying business opportunities for nature. The Taskforce ranked a UK\u000a      Peatland Code as their joint top opportunity out of 44 submitted\u000a      opportunities (http:\/\/www.valuing-nature.net\/taskforce).\u000a      In October 2012, Reed was invited to join the Roster of Experts\u000a      for the second phase of the Taskforce's work. In its final report in May\u000a      2013, the Taskforce recommended the development of a robust code for\u000a      peatland restoration (http:\/\/www.defra.gov.uk\/ecosystem-markets\/files\/Ecosystem-Markets-Task-Force-Final-Report-.pdf).\u000a    The Natural Environment White Paper committed to producing a Payment for\u000a      Ecosystem Service Best Practice Guide, which Defra published in May 2013\u000a      co-authored by Reed, featuring the Peatland Code as a case study,\u000a      based directly on Reed's research at BCU (https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/\u000a          payments-for-ecosystem-services-pes-best-practice-guide). The\u000a      White Paper committed to producing a Payment for Ecosystem Service Action\u000a      Plan, which Defra also published in May 2013, and which drew specifically\u000a      on Reed's research to highlight peatland restoration via the\u000a      Peatland Code as one of five opportunity areas (reference 1, section 5).\u000a      This committed Defra to a number of actions, including the launch of a\u000a      pilot Peatland Code (reference 2, section 5), and publication of metrics\u000a      to underpin the research developed in collaboration with Reed\u000a      (reference 3, section 3). In July 2013, the Committee on Climate Change\u000a      (an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act\u000a      2008) highlighted the development of a Peatland Code as a \"key priority\",\u000a      drawing on evidence from Defra's PES Action Plan (http:\/\/www.theccc.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/ASC-2013-Chap4_singles_2.pdf).\u000a    Since joining BCU in July 2012, Reed has been Research Manager\u000a      for IUCN's UK Peatland Programme. The government's commitment to the\u000a      Peatland Code is further illustrated by a letter to the IUCN UK Peatland\u000a      Programme (5th February 2013), from the four country Ministers, which sets\u000a      out a framework for action, including co-operation and co-ordinated action\u000a      to support the development of the Peatland Code (http:\/\/www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org\/sites\/all\/files\/20130205\u000a          Joint DA letter to IUCN.pdf). This intention was re-iterated\u000a      in the UK Government's National Adaptation Plan in July 2013\u000a      (https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/\u000a          209866\/pb13942-nap-20130701.pdf). Reed is now\u000a      supporting Welsh Government to co-ordinate peatland restoration under the\u000a      Peatland Code across the country and integrate payments with their Rural\u000a      Development Programme.\u000a    Defra funded Reed to carry out the necessary underpinning\u000a      research and develop the Peatland Code, and Reed is now on Defra's\u000a      commissioning team to fund continued research to support the next phase of\u000a      Code development. The Code was published online for public consultation in\u000a      June 2013 (for responses see appendix 2, publication 4, section 3), and\u000a      was launched by the Environment Minister, Richard Benyon, at an\u000a      International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conference on 10th\u000a      September 2013 (http:\/\/iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org\/news\/230).\u000aThe\u000a      Code has the potential to become a template for similar initiatives\u000a      internationally, and with this in mind in June 2013, Reed was\u000a      invited to present progress on developing the Code to a conference\u000a      organized by the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) in\u000a      co-operation with the European Network of Heads of Nature Conservation\u000a      Agencies (ENCA) (http:\/\/www.bfn.de\/0103_conferenzce-biodiversity0.html).\u000a    Since then, Defra asked Reed to design and organize a conference\u000a      to bring together all their PES Pilot projects to help them evaluate the\u000a      research programme, and identify cross-cutting lessons and implications\u000a      for policy (http:\/\/ekn.defra.gov.uk\/2013\/10\/04\/ecosystems-knowledge-network-event-practical-experiences-with-pes\/;\u000a      the event attracted over 70 participants and was over-subscribed). The\u000a      Living with Environmental Change partnership commissioned Reed to\u000a      write two Policy &amp; Practice Notes integrating his team's research with\u000a      findings from across the partnership: one on Payments for Ecosystem\u000a      Services generally, and another translating this work for the professions,\u000a      titled \"Natural capital for land management professionals\" (http:\/\/www.lwec.org.uk\/resources\/policy-and-practice-notes).\u000a    Defra's Deputy Director of Sustainable Land and Rural Evidence and\u000a      Analysis stated (Testimonial 1, section 5): \"Professor Reed's work\u000a        since joining BCU has made a significant contribution to the Payment for\u000a        Ecosystem Services agenda within Defra, with work he led on the UK\u000a        Peatland Code featuring prominently in the Defra PES Action Plan.\u000a        Moreover, the success of the research has been helped considerably by\u000a        Professor Reed promoting a collaborative and a multi-disciplinary\u000a        approach. Overall this research has made a considerable contribution and\u000a        provided us with valuable lessons for the development of Payment for\u000a        Ecosystem Service schemes in the UK.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study shows how research on ecosystem service governance is\u000a      directly supporting the Government's promotion of Payment for Ecosystem\u000a      Services (PES) schemes. These aim to pay for nature's services through the\u000a      involvement of business and the wider public. Specifically, research has\u000a      informed the development of a pilot UK Peatland Code to stimulate private\u000a      investment in peatland restoration. The pilot Code, which was published\u000a      for public feedback in June (and launched in September 2013 by the\u000a      Environment Minister), sets out guidance and quality standards for\u000a      sustainable business investment in peatlands. It has implications for\u000a      chartered surveyors, planners and others advising clients on future land\u000a      use and income generating opportunities.

On\u000a      joining BCU, he was invited to join the Roster of Experts for the second\u000a      phase of Defra's Ecosystem Markets Taskforce, and secured funding to:\u000a      develop a PES scheme for peatland restoration with South West Water\u000a      (funded by NERC and South West Water); scope a place-based PES scheme for\u000a      the South Pennines (funded by Natural England and Defra); and lead two\u000a      Defra PES pilot research projects to develop a UK Peatland Code and\u000a      explore the potential for Visitor Giving schemes to elicit payments for\u000a      peatland ecosystem services from members of the public.\u000a    The underpinning research used case study research in the South Pennines\u000a      and elsewhere to explore how Payments for Ecosystem Service schemes may be\u000a      designed to deliver a range of complementary ecosystem services in the\u000a      same location (e.g. climate, water, biodiversity and recreational benefits\u000a      from peatland restoration), whilst avoiding trade-offs between ecosystem\u000a      services where possible (for example, sequestering carbon via exotic\u000a      conifer plantations at the expense of native biodiversity). The research\u000a      explored the potential to elicit payments for carbon, biodiversity, water\u000a      quality and recreational benefits associated with peatland restoration,\u000a      including a scenario-based assessment of possible trade-offs (up to 2030)\u000a      and an assessment of market and governance needs.\u000a    This research clearly demonstrated that over appropriate timeframes (e.g.\u000a      30-100 year contracts) good practice peatland restoration can deliver\u000a      significant climate change mitigation benefits, with typical costs of\u000a      restoration between &#163;53,300-&#163;70,600 for a 100 hectare site. With typical\u000a      Greenhouse Gas emission reduction benefits of between 3.9-4.2 tonnes CO2\u000a      equivalent per hectare per year, this would equate to 11,700-12,600 tonnes\u000a      CO2 equivalent over a 30 year contract (equivalent to a year's\u000a      emissions of over 7,000 average family cars). If this investment were\u000a      turned into an asset, the investment would break even by the end of a 30\u000a      year contract if the carbon was worth &#163;7.50 per tonne. If carbon prices\u000a      were higher than &#163;7.50 per tonne, then this would represent a return on\u000a      investment. At the same time, this work would deliver improvements in\u000a      water quality (primarily reductions in brown colouration caused by\u000a      Dissolved Organic Carbon), biodiversity (in particular blanket bog\u000a      specialists) and recreational access (primarily due to restoration of deep\u000a      gullies). The research has demonstrated that there is a strong interest in\u000a      sponsoring peatland restoration from the private sector (notably from food\u000a      and drink, hospitality and horticulture) and corporations are willing to\u000a      pay a premium for UK-based projects that deliver climate change mitigation\u000a      alongside biodiversity and water benefits. However, the research investors\u000a      need appropriate Government-backed guidance to give them confidence that\u000a      their investments will deliver these benefits, and guidance is needed to\u000a      ensure landowners follow good practice restoration. Reed has\u000a      therefore led the development of a UK Peatland Code, funded by Defra and\u000a      supported by the Environment Minister, with the support of Environment\u000a      Ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14225","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This case study provides theoretical and policy fusions between SP and EA\u000d\u000a      translating complex science into accessible and operational\u000d\u000a      decision-support tools (RUFopoly and EATME) that enable different\u000d\u000a      public(s) audiences to engage with complex planning issues.

EATME is being developed and\u000d\u000a      tested simultaneously with the project co-investigators involving\u000d\u000a      academic, policy and practice participants. For example, Welsh Government\u000d\u000a      and NRW are using EATME within their policy frameworks.

Larkham and Morton's (1996-2004) work on the evolution,\u000d\u000a      form and function of fringe belts identified the need for more diverse and\u000d\u000a      flexible planning interventions, supporting the needs of local communities\u000d\u000a      and their environment.\u000d\u000a    Scott's RELU-funded research (2010-2012) advances this work within\u000d\u000a      a more holistic treatment of RUF character and potential. Although the RUF\u000d\u000a      now represents the dominant UK space (Scott, 4), this research exposes its\u000d\u000a      `forgotten' nature; lacking pro-active and dedicated policy interventions.\u000d\u000a      This becomes urgent given contemporary planning policy and growth debates\u000d\u000a      which position the RUF as a `battleground' within which new housing and\u000d\u000a      infrastructure developments are contested, rather than set within more\u000d\u000a      shared visions of the kind of RUF places and environments public(s) want.\u000d\u000a    This reactive interface between built and natural environments is\u000d\u000a      typified by policy `disintegration', where interventions are based on\u000d\u000a      different paradigms, governance, scales and tools (Scott, 1). These\u000d\u000a      readily conflict: for example policy agendas built on localism (built\u000d\u000a      environment) versus landscape-scale approaches (natural environment). Our\u000d\u000a      research deconstructs this policy `disintegration' through narratives\u000d\u000a      revealing how natural and built environment interests coincide and\u000d\u000a      conflict within the same geographical space. The research then shows how\u000d\u000a      through the intersection of spatial planning (SP) and the ecosystem\u000d\u000a      approach (EA), alternative narratives maximising connectivity,\u000d\u000a      long-termism and values, can help supersede traditional silos and\u000d\u000a      administrative boundaries, creating multiple benefits (see section 3\u000d\u000a      citations).\u000d\u000a    The integration of EA and SP paradigms fills a research and policy void.\u000d\u000a      Using a research model involving a transdisciplinary research team that\u000d\u000a      crosses academic, policy and practice boundaries, enables co-production\u000d\u000a      and social learning to shape the research `journey', improving\u000d\u000a      collaboration across and within research-policy-practice domains. The\u000d\u000a      resultant conceptual framework champions more accessible end-user `lenses'\u000d\u000a      of `values', `time' and `connections' through which RUF futures can be\u000d\u000a      co-developed. By re-interpreting complex concepts (EA and SP), we\u000d\u000a      engineered new pathways across disciplinary and professional silos,\u000d\u000a      maximizing the potential for positive public engagement as exemplified in\u000d\u000a      our RUFopoly game (section 4; http:\/\/www.bcu.ac.uk\/research\/-centres-of-excellence\/centre-for-environment-and-\u000a        society\/projects\/relu\/rufopoly).\u000d\u000a    CESR's expertise at the RUF research and policy interface secured Scott's\u000a      leadership in a Defra and Research Councils' UK (RCUK) funded project (UK\u000d\u000a      National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) Follow On) that mainstreams the NEA\u000d\u000a      Ecosystem Assessment (2011) within an operational tools framework. The\u000d\u000a      resulting `Ecosystem Approach Toolkit: Mainstreaming the Environment' (EATME:\u000d\u000a        http:\/\/www.eatme-tree.org.uk), provides an accessible web portal\u000d\u000a      within which users navigate through a policy cycle\u000d\u000a      (Ideas-Survey-Assess-Plan-Act-Evaluate). Each stage has guidance adapted\u000d\u000a      from the 12 principles of the EA and selected case study experiences,\u000d\u000a      which then signposts the most appropriate policy and decision-support\u000d\u000a      tools to use. Our EA toolkit consists of tools (regulatory, incentive,\u000d\u000a      valuation, futures and ecosystem services) that were co- selected on their\u000d\u000a      policy impact and suitability for incorporation within an Ecosystem\u000d\u000a      Services Framework. We then subjected each tool to a bespoke\u000d\u000a      ecosystem-proofing process with accompanying guidance. EATME is thus\u000d\u000a      designed to mainstream nature into policy, projects, plans or programmes\u000d\u000a      and is built on our transdisciplinary research model to maximise research\u000d\u000a      and policy impact.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18931","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Over the last decade public art has increasingly become associated with\u000d\u000a      the wider processes of regeneration and place shaping. However, the\u000d\u000a      assessment of the impact of public art in relation to wider regeneration\u000d\u000a      benefits is complex and difficult to identify. This is reflective of a\u000d\u000a      number of factors, including: the uncontained nature of the audience that\u000d\u000a      views public art; the fact that the target population for anticipated\u000d\u000a      impacts of the art is very broad; that audience contact can be intentional\u000d\u000a      or accidental, conscious or subconscious, direct or indirect; and that\u000d\u000a      outcomes are often time-lagged, evolving over a number of years. Since\u000d\u000a      2003 the cultural policy and public art policy analysis and evaluation\u000d\u000a      work undertaken through the underpinning research outlined in section 3\u000d\u000a      has directly addressed these issues, providing policy makers with\u000d\u000a      information and evidence with which to assess the impact of their\u000d\u000a      investments in public art works and public art strategies.\u000d\u000a    The policy impact of this research activity has been spread throughout\u000d\u000a      the UK across a range of local authorities and public sector agencies.\u000d\u000a      This work has involved extensive interaction with the policy-making\u000d\u000a      community through numerous strategy and policy evaluations for local\u000d\u000a      authorities, as well as assessments of national cultural and public art\u000d\u000a      programmes relating to the built environment (projects for Arts Council of\u000d\u000a      Wales, Arts Council England, Scottish Arts Council). At a national level\u000d\u000a      our research has informed both organisational change and spending\u000d\u000a      priorities of key cultural institutions. For example, the research\u000d\u000a      undertaken for Public Art Wales (2003) and the Scottish Arts Council\u000d\u000a      (2004), was used to determine the structure for public art provision in\u000d\u000a      these organisations, as well as their delivery and commissioning\u000d\u000a      strategies. Equally, our research for the Arts Council, England in 2007\/8\u000d\u000a      contributed to the development of a rationalised approach to a national\u000d\u000a      cultural programme (Architecture Week) designed to promote and improve\u000d\u000a      public awareness of the significance of art, design and architecture in\u000d\u000a      the built environment.\u000d\u000a    Our contribution to the cultural regeneration of place has also been made\u000d\u000a      at the regional level. Between 2007 and 2008, working with colleagues in\u000d\u000a      the University's Policy Research Institute, we contributed to an extensive\u000d\u000a      piece of research on the `Welcome to the North' Public Art Programme'\u000d\u000a      (part of a wider `Welcome to the North' initiative funded under the\u000d\u000a      management of `The Northern Way' programme of regional development\u000d\u000a      activity in the mid-200s). Our research both reviewed and evaluated the\u000d\u000a      success of the `Welcome to the North Public Art Programme' as well as\u000d\u000a      assessing its broader aim of establishing a public art programme designed\u000d\u000a      to enhance the profile, perception and overall quality of place of the\u000d\u000a      Northern Way area (the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber and the North\u000d\u000a      East). (see: http:\/\/www.artscouncil.org.uk\/funding\/funded-projects\/case-studies\/welcome-north-public-art-programme\/).\u000d\u000a    One of the key recommendations from the research was the need to maximize\u000d\u000a      publicity and promotional messages during the post-delivery stage of the\u000d\u000a      programme in order to ensure that its impacts continue to accrue. Indeed,\u000d\u000a      our work demonstrated that the presence of the art works and their impact\u000d\u000a      upon the wider public would continue to emerge beyond the life-time of the\u000d\u000a      overall programme. The key recommendation here (and impact on the\u000d\u000a      programme) was that there was a need to identify ways in which the art\u000d\u000a      works could be mobilized to promote quality of place and improve the\u000d\u000a      perception of the North of England in the long term. In practical terms\u000d\u000a      this required the commissioning organisation to develop approaches to\u000d\u000a      post-programme management that linked the imagery and presence of the art\u000d\u000a      work to major event promotion within specific localised contexts.\u000d\u000a    Our work at the local level has been influential in developing local\u000d\u000a      public art strategies. For example, as the Wigan Pier Quarter Strategy\u000d\u000a      document suggests, \"Consultants RKL have prepared a Public Art Strategy\u000d\u000a        for the Pier Quarter. The strategy shows how an integrated public art\u000d\u000a        strategy could help to create a new image for the area and help to\u000d\u000a        enhance the distinctive qualities of the site.\"\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.move2wigan.com\/images\/links\/WPQ-Strategy-Final.pdf)\u000d\u000a      (p.9).

Policy for the renewal of places through culture (including\u000d\u000a      public art) is now a feature of many cities as they aim to transform their\u000d\u000a      economies and establish their cultural competitive advantage on a global\u000d\u000a      stage. At the same time, the extent to which culture positively\u000d\u000a      contributes to the regeneration of areas and neighbourhoods that have been\u000d\u000a      subject to economic, social and physical decline has become a central\u000d\u000a      concern of government and regeneration agencies. In an evidence-based\u000d\u000a      policy environment research and evaluation has a key role to play in\u000d\u000a      assessing the impacts and benefits of cultural activity and this is where\u000d\u000a      activity has been placed with staff (Strange, Wishardt) providing policy\u000d\u000a      analysis and evaluation research.\u000d\u000a    Research has been commissioned and carried out across the UK for a range\u000d\u000a      of local and national organisations. In particular, research activity has\u000d\u000a      centred on 3 national (Arts Council of Wales, Arts Council England,\u000d\u000a        Scottish Arts Council), 1 regional (Yorkshire Forward) and 6\u000d\u000a      local authority projects (Kent County Council, Durham County Council,\u000d\u000a        Wigan Metropolitan District Council, Hull City Council, Leeds City\u000d\u000a        Council). Each of these has provided a detailed interrogation and\u000d\u000a      assessment of existing policy provision while carrying out evaluation work\u000d\u000a      that has informed future strategy and policy development. This work\u000d\u000a      demonstrates a sustained commitment to improving policy development and\u000d\u000a      policy options that have potential to impact on the aesthetic and cultural\u000d\u000a      renewal of places and the people that live and work there. While the\u000d\u000a      results of this work have been used by clients to develop better policy\u000d\u000a      options for public art, the work has also been disseminated widely within\u000d\u000a      professional and academic communities, with the outcomes of research being\u000d\u000a      presented and published to national and international audiences.\u000d\u000a    The research work is carried out in collaboration with colleagues both\u000d\u000a      within the University and external to it. In particular, CUDEM staff\u000d\u000a      (Strange, Wishardt) work closely with David Devins, Doug Sandle and\u000d\u000a      Jonathan Long (Leeds Metropolitan University) and Graham Roberts (RKL &#8212;\u000d\u000a      Roberts, Knight, Leeds Metropolitan consultancy), established in 2003\u000d\u000a      specifically to undertake public art evaluation work. The range of\u000d\u000a      projects this research partnership has carried out is extensive with 10\u000d\u000a      projects undertaken since 2003. The number of past (and continuing)\u000d\u000a      commissions is illustrative of an established research expertise and\u000d\u000a      network that is well-placed to secure future work and retain research\u000d\u000a      impact.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18932","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The flow chart below outlines the work undertaken to demonstrate the\u000d\u000a        types of impact achieved:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    Water quality results indicated that shallow well water was heavily\u000d\u000a      polluted with both total and faecal coliforms, especially after the on-set\u000d\u000a      of the rains. About 95% of all the wells tested failed to meet safe\u000d\u000a      drinking water values for untreated water in the wet season, while about\u000d\u000a      80% of the wells failed in the dry season(1,2,3). It was noted\u000d\u000a      that the main forms of contamination from shallow wells emanate from\u000d\u000a      bacteriological and physical constituents; in contrast, the main form of\u000d\u000a      contamination from boreholes stem from chemical elements. The detrimental\u000d\u000a      impact on human health of chemical contamination normally requires many\u000d\u000a      decades of exposure before it can be recognised. Where life spans are\u000d\u000a      short due to high incidence of infectious diseases emanating from\u000d\u000a      bacteriological contamination, it is this form of contamination that needs\u000d\u000a      to be addressed first for the developing world. To immediately try to\u000d\u000a      minimise water related diseases, Water Officers and Village Chiefs were\u000d\u000a      informed (2006-08) of the wells, which were yielding grossly biologically\u000d\u000a      contaminated water(A); and hence advised to either just use\u000d\u000a      this water source for washing or to boil the water for at least one minute\u000d\u000a      before consuming.\u000d\u000a    From this data a series of publications were formed(e.g. 1-6).\u000d\u000a      Inter alia, these fed into the Government of the Republic of Malawi\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Irrigation and Water Development, Second National Water\u000d\u000a      Develop Project (NWDP II &#8212; 2011) entitled `Water Resources Investment\u000d\u000a      Strategy', World Bank funded(B); hence used to developed\u000d\u000a      policy. The field sampling data has also been presented to MPs at the\u000d\u000a      House of Commons and has provided direction to others researchers(e.g.C-H).\u000d\u000a      Laboratory trials were undertaken on Moringa oleifera,\u000d\u000a      Jatropha curcas and Guar gum extracts. Toxicity tests were also\u000d\u000a      conducted on these extracts. These trials showed that the addition of\u000d\u000a      plant extracts can considerably improve the quality of shallow well water.\u000d\u000a      About 70% reduction in TC and FC was noted on average. At optimum dosage,\u000d\u000a      turbidity reduction of water ranged from 10-100% for the three plant\u000d\u000a      extracts. All three extracts proved non-toxic at the recommended\u000d\u000a      concentrations for water treatment based on the ecotoxicity results. To\u000d\u000a      implement the use of local plant extracts, grown throughout rural\u000d\u000a      villages, a novel small-scale `bolt-on' shallow well water purification\u000d\u000a      system has been developed. Initial field data demonstrates that\u000d\u000a      improvement in shallow well water quality of around 80% can be achieved.\u000d\u000a      Hence, if implemented for every shallow well in Malawi around 1.5 million\u000d\u000a      Malawians could have significantly improved water sources. Interest in\u000d\u000a      applying the technology on a larger-scale has been expressed by NGOs and\u000d\u000a      the private sector(G) and will be further developed once the\u000d\u000a      full-scale site trial has been completed. It is hoped that such a system\u000d\u000a      will provide a unique sustainable and economical solution to significantly\u000d\u000a      reduce waterborne diseases to some of the poorest people in the world.\u000d\u000a    In addition to actually conducting the research work, funding from DelPHE\u000d\u000a      (2009-12) was awarded to develop a new style MSc course, in conjunction\u000d\u000a      with the Polytechnic University of Malawi(10). Prior to the\u000d\u000a      onset of this course people in the public or industrial sectors had to\u000d\u000a      leave their jobs (travel overseas) and thus become a full-time student to\u000d\u000a      gain a higher qualification, due to the limitations of available courses\u000d\u000a      in-country. The associated costs, both financial and emotional for\u000d\u000a      studying overseas are high. Also, what they are taught and encouraged to\u000d\u000a      research, in general, targets the cultural and economic situation in the\u000d\u000a      host country; little benefit may accrue to the student's country of\u000d\u000a      origin. In addition, after they have gained their qualification it might\u000d\u000a      be a few years before they gain employment again in their home country. A\u000d\u000a      market had developed for good quality assured postgraduate courses that\u000d\u000a      can be delivered in-country at an affordable cost, enabling students to\u000d\u000a      maintain full employment during their studies. A total of 39 students are\u000d\u000a      currently (2013) studying on this programme.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This study analysed the shallow well drinking water quality of 17,000\u000d\u000a      rural Malawians.

A prioritisation system was derived (in\u000d\u000a      2008) to select the most suitable extracts, which took into account such\u000d\u000a      criteria as availability, purifb01cation potential, yield and costs(4,8).\u000d\u000a      An empirical parametric study was then undertaken (2008-10) to optimise\u000d\u000a      the performance on the most promising plant extracts together with initial\u000d\u000a      cytotoxicity analyses, both in the laboratory and in the field(9).\u000d\u000a      Laboratory experiments were undertaken in the microbiology and civil\u000d\u000a      engineering laboratories at Leeds Met, forming an interdisciplinary\u000d\u000a      element to the project (e.g. 5,6); data from these experiments\u000d\u000a      were then fed into field studies in Malawi (2010-11) regarding the\u000d\u000a      development of a water purification system(11).\u000d\u000a    The first stage the full-scale Malawi field trial commenced July 2013.\u000d\u000a      The trial consists of a shallow well with a `bolt-on' water purification\u000d\u000a      system, housing a low cost telemetry cell phone network system to remotely\u000d\u000a      monitor the performance of the well(12).\u000d\u000a    A new MSc programme was established in Malawi (2009) to increase the\u000d\u000a      level of knowledge of water officials, stakeholders and the alike (10).\u000d\u000a      Engagement workshops and laboratory sessions also ran throughout 2012\/13.\u000d\u000a      These sessions were precursors to the international volunteering field\u000d\u000a      trial, which included 14 multi-disciplinary undergraduate students from\u000d\u000a      both Malawi and the UK.\u000d\u000a    Dr Martin Pritchard, a Reader at Leeds Met, overall directs this research\u000d\u000a      work. Dr Alan Edmondson, a Principal Lecturer in Microbiology at Leeds\u000d\u000a      Met; Dr Andy Swan, a Senior Lecturer in Civil Engineering at Leeds Met;\u000d\u000a      Professor Theresa Mkandawire from Malawi Polytechnic and Professor Gary\u000d\u000a      O'Neill from Creh Analytical all contributed towards the success of this\u000d\u000a      project. The work to-date has included three PhD projects &#8212; ranging from\u000d\u000a      monitoring in the field in Africa, to undertaking laboratory trials in the\u000d\u000a      UK, to becoming a hybrid of both.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18933","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The group's research has had major impacts in three areas: Building\u000a        Regulations: The group is at the forefront of regulatory\u000a      development, Bell served on the CLG's regulatory teams for the 2006 review\u000a      and following this, work at Stamford Brook (Wingfield et al. 2011), Elm\u000a      Tree Mews (Bell et al., 2010) and work funded by the Mineral Wool\u000a      Insulation Manufacturer's Association (MIMA &#8212; Wingfield et al., 2009)\u000a      highlighted, as never before, a performance gap that could undermine\u000a      regulation and the Government's 2016 zero carbon housing targets. Bell was\u000a      invited again, as convenor and technical author, to lead industry working\u000a      parties and advise ministers for both 2010 and 2013 reviews. The\u000a      contribution was recognised in a National Audit Office report (NAO, 2008)\u000a      and in evidence to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC\u000a      2009) in addition to citations in the consultation documents for the 2010\u000a      (CLG 2009) and 2013 (CLG 2012) reviews. Crucially, the work on the party\u000a      wall thermal bypass (Wingfield et al., 2009 and Lowe et al., 2007) led to\u000a      regulatory change in 2010 to ensure bypasses were fully accounted for in\u000a      the national calculation methodology (SAP) and the Approved Documents (HM\u000a      Government, 2010). In addition, the government's Green Deal is set to\u000a      include party wall installation as an accredited improvement measure in\u000a      existing dwellings with cavity party walls. This will ensure that the\u000a      group's research will have application in both new build and existing\u000a      dwellings. Although the full carbon impact remains uncertain it is likely\u000a      that carbon savings could be in the millions of tonnes per year.\u000a    Low and zero carbon housing policy: Bell provides leadership on\u000a      the Zero Carbon Hub (ZCH) which, inter alia, cited performance gap studies\u000a      from the group (Bell et al. 2010) and was instrumental in providing the\u000a      clearest policy statement to date; over 90% of new dwellings\u000a      as-constructed should be zero carbon as verified by effective measurement\u000a      (ZCH 2011, recommendation 4a). Work is on-going through a\u000a      government\/industry project to develop solutions (ZCH 2013) Bell is a\u000a      steering group member. In addition, Bell's membership of the DECC Expert\u000a      Measures Group advises on In-Use factors for DECC's Green Deal program\u000a      (driven largely by work at Leeds Met). The award of &#163;526,800 to research\u000a      the Leeds Green Deal Pilot Project (led by Gorse and Stafford) shows\u000a      recognition by government. Further awards by TSB on their Building\u000a      Performance and Evaluation and Retrofit Programmes represent a significant\u000a      body of work (value in excess of &#163;700,000 led by Johnston and Gorse) which\u000a      continue to identify methods of improving building performance and\u000a      efficiency.\u000a    The group's identification of the performance gap prompted the Technology\u000a      Strategy Board's (TSB) programme on Building Performance Evaluation (BPE)\u000a      which adopts the group's Co-heating Test protocol. This standard has also\u000a      been embraced by the IEA Annex 58 programme on whole building performance,\u000a      for which the group are leaders in whole house heat loss (see Johnston et\u000a      al. 2012). Thus the group is changing the way the construction industry\u000a      deals with as built energy efficiency internationally, as well as in the\u000a      UK.\u000a    The house building industry and manufacturers: The group advises\u000a      the Home Builders Federation and National Home Builders Council and\u000a      individual developers through the Good Homes Aliance, ZCH, TSB and DECC\u000a      programmes. Dissemination work through CPD (LowCarb4Real -Bell et al.\u000a      2009, Green Vision) has engaged hundreds of professionals over the last 4\u000a      years; over 150 were reached through the Green Visions program, and over\u000a      200 professionals attended meetings hosted by the group for the Leeds\u000a      Sustainability Institute, the IEA's annex 58 and the Association of\u000a      Researchers in Construction Management. As an indication of the wider\u000a      interest in the group's research the group website which provides details\u000a      on projects and their outputs was visited by over 5,300 unique visitors\u000a      between August 2012 and September 2013 whilst the Low Carbon Housing\u000a      Virtual Site developed by the group was visited almost 11,000 times.\u000a    Commissions from MIMA (Wingfield et al., 2009 and Bell, 2012) and\u000a      collaborations with Knauf have led to the development of products\u000a      specifically for the new insulation market in the party wall bypass worth\u000a      &#163;millions.

Thanks to the group's work\u000a      it is now accepted that failure to address the performance gap carries\u000a      significant commercial risks and undermines energy and carbon reduction\u000a      policy.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The group's forensic research into housing energy and carbon performance\u000a      has established the existence of \"performance gap\" between designed energy\u000a      performance and that achieved in completed dwellings.

The\u000a      review, undertaken for Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Office of the\u000a      Deputy Prime Minister established the importance of not only raising\u000a      standards but also establishing the extent to which improved standards\u000a      could be achieved in main-stream house building.\u000a    This work led to a number of housing field studies aimed at understanding\u000a      the issues involved in the production of low energy\/carbon housing. The\u000a      key underpinning studies are set out below:\u000a    \u000a       An investigation of the implementation of Part L robust details\u000a        undertaken for CLG from 2003 to 2005 (Bell et al. 2005). This project\u000a        established through a series of design and construction site studies a\u000a        wide range of design and construction defects that would lead to energy\u000a        and condensation underperformance. Subsequent hygrothermal modelling\u000a        work at UCL confirmed an increased risk of surface and interstitial\u000a        condensation as a result of insulation placement and other defects. The\u000a        field work also identified significant issues relating to levels of\u000a        understanding, skills and design &amp; construction processes.\u000a       The Stamford Brook Field trial (Wingfield et al., 2011), conducted\u000a        from 2001 to 2008, was an action research study of the implementation of\u000a        advanced regulatory standards. It involved a partnership between two\u000a        major house builders, the National Trust and CLG in the construction of\u000a        a large housing development of some 700 dwellings. This was probably the\u000a        first study that measured not only the extent of energy underperformance\u000a        but also identified many of the technological and process issues that\u000a        explained the performance observed. Of particular significance was the\u000a        characterisation of a thermal bypass in party wall cavities (Lowe et al.\u000a        2007), a hitherto unrecognised heat loss mechanism that is now\u000a        recognised and incorporated into building regulation and the regulatory\u000a        national calculation methodology (SAP).\u000a       The Elm Tree Mews project (Bell et al. 2010) led on from the pivotal\u000a        work at Stamford Brook by applying and improving on the action research\u000a        approach. This project was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and\u000a        sought to explore the issues involved in constructing to a standard that\u000a        addressed the zero carbon trajectory set out by the Government in 2006.\u000a        It also enabled an exploration of modern off-site technology.\u000a        Significant underperformance was again observed not only in the fabric\u000a        but also in the configuration of a communal heat pump.\u000a       Collaboration in the Carbon, Comfort and Control project (EPSRC\u000a        funded) extended the scope of the group's work by addressing performance\u000a        gap issues involving controls, design and occupant behaviour associated\u000a        with heat pumps (Stafford 2011). Findings demonstrated the complex\u000a        interplay between the control of low carbon technologies, behaviour and\u000a        the performance of the envelope.

In 2002 the EPSRC Innovative\u000a        Manufacturing Initiative further challenged the construction sector\u000a      to `adopt a radical change programme based upon both a re-organisation\u000a        of the way that work is procured and the way that work is managed and\u000a        integrated.' Each recognised that the way that work is placed in the\u000a      construction sector should be used to shape the sector and to drive\u000a      performance improvement beyond cost efficiencies to include wider social\u000a      and economic benefit.\u000a    From 2001 Salford determined that projects supported by the EPSRC\u000a      Innovative Manufacturing Initiative (IMI): Salford Centre for Research and\u000a      Innovation in the Built Environment (SCRI) should demonstrate impact\u000a      beyond academia. Salford has achieved this aim by working with UK national\u000a      government through current and previous administrations, and local\u000a      government and industry to support the development of regional and\u000a      national implementation mechanisms following from Rethinking Construction.\u000a      The impact of Procuring Social and Economic Value through Construction\u000a      is underpinned by the following research:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a2002: Trust in Construction developed a\u000a        social\/psychological model focused on the trust elements of team\u000a        integration and how different project factors affect the formation of\u000a        trust. A Trust Inventory and a relationship mapping tool were developed,\u000a        to identify trust-based team structures. These were supported by\u000a        additional tools incorporated into the workshop to address mutual\u000a        objectives, performance measurement, roles and responsibilities, team\u000a        structures and dispute resolution. The research found that trust by\u000a        itself would not change performance but needs to be inextricably linked\u000a        to full management interventions; improved processes and procedures; and\u000a        pointed towards supply chain integration and collaborative working.

The main observations revealed that `policy\u000a        through procurement initiatives' require full integration into\u000a        procurement, integrated as early as possible in the procurement process\u000a        and actively managed through each stage of procurement.

A method is described for determining the\u000d\u000a        sound power radiated from roof structures excited by water impact. A\u000d\u000a        method of estimating the sound intensity level from natural rainfall is\u000d\u000a        derived based upon the measured results and the characteristics of\u000d\u000a        natural rainfall. [1]\u000a\u000d\u000a      \u000a1995: Building envelope: Lam et al conducted\u000d\u000a        fundamental research into the sound insulation characteristics of\u000d\u000a        building envelope constructions.

A new method\u000d\u000a        for predicting the sound reduction index (SRI) of commercial double-skin\u000d\u000a        cladding systems was proposed and validated by measurement with\u000d\u000a        implementation of the developed models funded by the industry trade\u000d\u000a        association (Metal Cladding and Roofing Manufacturers Association). [2]\u000a\u000d\u000a      \u000a1989-onwards: Acoustic Diffusers: Diffusers are used in\u000d\u000a        spaces where acoustics is a critical requirement. They can be used to\u000d\u000a        improve speech intelligibility in railway stations, theatres and\u000d\u000a        teleconferencing rooms and are used in auditoria and studios where\u000d\u000a        quality is important. Cox, Lam et al identified flaws in existing\u000d\u000a        methods of characterising diffusion and proposed a new approach based on\u000d\u000a        spatial auto-correlation functions, subsequently adopted as an\u000d\u000a        international measurement standard and a method of obtaining a `single\u000d\u000a        figure of merit' for a diffuser which has facilitated new designs of\u000d\u000a        diffusers used in rooms around the world [3]. Angus proposed\u000d\u000a        binary reflection amplitude grating which provides diffusion about an\u000d\u000a        octave above the frequency whose wavelength is twice the size of the\u000d\u000a        binary element.

A `reception plate method' provides an\u000d\u000a        engineering method for characterisation of equipment in buildings. [5]\u000d\u000a        The equipment is installed on two test plates and the vibration of the\u000d\u000a        plates is used to infer the `source strength' of the machine and its\u000d\u000a        structural dynamic properties. The single reception plate method was\u000d\u000a        adopted as a European measurement standard, EN 15657-1:2009 for\u000d\u000a        characterisation of structure borne sound sources on heavy floors.\u000d\u000a        Moorhouse, Elliott et al subsequently developed the `in situ blocked\u000d\u000a        force' method where equipment cannot be decoupled from its surroundings\u000d\u000a        for testing. This method leads to a more detailed description of the\u000d\u000a        sound source than the reception plate method and has been widely adopted\u000d\u000a        in the automotive industry and within aerospace. [6]\u000a\u000d\u000a      \u000a2009: Low frequency noise: Moorhouse et al developed\u000d\u000a        and applied a procedure for the assessment of low frequency noise (LFN)\u000d\u000a        complaints [7]. The development of the assessment method\u000d\u000a        included laboratory tests addressing low frequency hearing threshold and\u000d\u000a        the effect on acceptability of fluctuation, and field measurements\u000d\u000a        complemented interview-based questionnaires. Environmental health\u000d\u000a        departments then conducted a series of six trials with genuine \"live\"\u000d\u000a        LFN complaints to test the procedure.

LHSA was formally endorsed by the then Scottish\u000a      Executive through implementation of the 2001 Housing (Scotland) Act, which\u000a      established the preparation of local housing strategies as a statutory\u000a      local authority duty and required these be informed by an evidence-base\u000a      created by an LHSA process. The current guidance for housing needs and\u000a      demand assessment laid down by the Scottish Government continues to draw\u000a      strongly on the LHSA framework. Current English (and Welsh) housing needs\u000a      and demand assessment guidance also explicitly acknowledges a continuing\u000a      debt to LHSA.\u000a    Alongside the original 1993 Guidance, Glasgow academics produced LHSA\u000a      case studies for Edinburgh and Rural Dunbartonshire. Subsequently, when\u000a      Local Housing Strategies became a statutory requirement after 2001,\u000a      Glasgow University contributed to teams that carried out the entire LHSA\u000a      requirement for West Lothian and the rural example of the Western Isles.\u000a      In each case the complete process of LHSA was undertaken: review of\u000a      planning and policy documents, assessing the appropriate geography for\u000a      study, undertaking a data audit, undertaking analysis of external drivers,\u000a      examining each tenure and their key interactions before identifying key\u000a      long-term problems or imbalances. The final reports were used by the local\u000a      authorities in these regions as an evidence base which underpinned and\u000a      shaped their Local Housing Strategies and forward planning initiatives.\u000a    The main impacts of the research, therefore, centre on the application of\u000a      the research to develop good practice guides to enhance the practice of\u000a      housing professionals; the extensive influence of the research on the\u000a      training of housing analysts, researchers and policymakers on LHSA; and\u000a      the subsequent positive impact that these activities have had on the\u000a      effective planning and management of social housing, with the research\u000a      informing the Local\u000a        Housing Strategies of numerous local authorities and housing\u000a      providers. Essentially, LHSA has influenced two decades of public sector\u000a      housing investment decisions.\u000a    Influencing the formation of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001:\u000a    As noted above, the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 enshrined in law a\u000a      requirement that all local authorities produce a local housing strategy\u000a      that was informed by an evidence-base from an LHSA process. The research\u000a      influenced the forming of this legislation by virtue of Maclennan being\u000a      invited to chair the Single Housing Plans Group (SHPG), which was\u000a      established in February 2000 during the drafting stages of the Housing\u000a      (Scotland) 2001 Bill. The SHPG was tasked with taking forward a Housing\u000a      Green Paper proposal for a single housing plan for each local authority\u000a      area. Membership of the group comprised representatives from the Scottish\u000a      Executive, Scottish Homes, COSLA, local authorities, the Scottish\u000a      Federation of Housing Associations and the Chartered Institute of Housing.\u000a      The impact of the new law was evident right up until and into 2008 when\u000a      changes were made to the local housing strategy requirements; significant\u000a      elements of LHSA remain in the approach and the guidance continues to form\u000a      part of the cluster of materials adopted by the Scottish Government's\u000a      Centre for Housing Market analysis.\u000a    Production of Good Practice Guides for local authorities:\u000a    On the basis of the LHSA research, GU researchers were commissioned by\u000a      Communities Scotland to co-produce LHSA Good Practice Guides to provide\u000a      practical assistance to Local Authorities on how to carry out LHSA. In\u000a      preparing these Guides, titled, Local Housing Systems Analysis: Good\u000a        Practice Guide, the research team contributed to Local Authorities'\u000a      processes for assessing need and ensuring the effective provision of\u000a      social housing. The researchers produced successive versions of these Good\u000a      Practice Guides in 1993, 1998 and 2004.\u000a    The subsequent development of Scottish Housing Needs and Demand\u000a      Assessments (HNDAs), by the Scottish Government in 2008 drew heavily on\u000a      the LHSA model in its guidance. This is evident in the HNDA Guidance where\u000a      it states that it is based upon the Local Housing Market Assessment\u000a        Guide of the Welsh Assembly 2006, which was prepared by the research\u000a      team using the LHSA model; and on the Strategic Housing Market\u000a        Assessments: Practice Guidance, Communities and Local Government\u000a      2007, which explicitly states that it is `based upon the Local Housing\u000a        Systems Analysis Best Practice Guide, Communities Scotland, 2004',\u000a      which was also based on the LHSA research.\u000a    Delivery of training courses for practitioners in Scotland:\u000a    In addition to producing new guidance for housing professionals, members\u000a      of the research team wrote and delivered successive waves of training\u000a      courses to staff at Scottish Homes; Communities Scotland; Scottish\u000a      Office\/Executive staff; housing associations; and local authorities in\u000a      Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The team carried out several rounds of\u000a      this 2-day and 3-day training courses, which involved:\u000a    \u000a      Conceptualising housing as a system and exploring its practical\u000a        implications\u000a      Undertaking data audit and sources of housing data\u000a      Housing market geography\u000a      LHSA and economic analysis\u000a      The meaning of housing need\u000a      Housing needs assessment\u000a      Drivers of housing change\u000a      Balance and imbalance.\u000a    \u000a    The training involved a mix of plenary sessions and practical exercises.\u000a      Training courses were provided around both the 1998 and 2004 guidance\u000a      publications (largely to councils, Scottish Homes and Communities Scotland\u000a      staff but also Government, housing association and other housing\u000a      specialists). Training was also organised with the Scottish Housing Best\u000a      Value Network (twice in 2007 and 2010) and for Glasgow city council staff\u000a      transferring to Glasgow Housing Association. Each session, either 2 or 3\u000a      days long, was attended by 25-30 delegates i.e. around 200-240 delegates\u000a      in total.\u000a    Extension of Reach - NI and Wales:\u000a    The demand for guidance and training in LHSA extended beyond public\u000a      bodies and local authorities in Scotland and over the period from 1993 to\u000a      2011 the Glasgow University researchers developed analogous LHSA Good\u000a      Practice Guides for the Welsh Assembly and undertook extensive research\u000a      and training with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.\u000a    Influencing housing strategies in Northern Ireland:\u000a    Most recently (2007-12), Young, O'Sullivan and Gibb, carried out a\u000a      comprehensive, major study of Greater Belfast and a mini-LHSA study for\u000a      the town of Larne, for the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE). The\u000a      Head of Research at NIHE stated that the University of Glasgow research `identified\u000a        potential future imbalances in the Northern Ireland's housing market,\u000a        enabling scarce resources to be targeted in a more meaningful way'.\u000a    The Belfast study involved identifying appropriate geographical areas for\u000a      study, developing a good practice guidance report and conducting a\u000a      systematic case study of Belfast alongside training delivered by members\u000a      of the research team in Belfast in 2010-11. The Head of Research at NIHE\u000a      further explained that this training ensured that `the planning teams\u000a        were equipped to undertake LHSA for the remaining 10 housing market\u000a        areas'; additionally, the Head of Research went on to affirm that:\u000a    [T]hese key strategic research studies have had a major influence on\u000a        the development of housing strategies and the social housing programme\u000a        in recent years.

A fundamental part of this work resulted in the advancement\u000a      of a new conceptual approach for understanding in practical and planning\u000a      terms how housing systems operate and change over time, known as Local\u000a      Housing Systems Analysis (LHSA). The framework was explicitly intended to\u000a      assist public decision makers to diagnose the need for and nature of\u000a      policy interventions in the form of public investment.\u000a    In 1993 University of Glasgow researchers Duncan Maclennan, Professor &#8212;\u000a      Urban Studies at Glasgow (USG)*; Alison More, Lecturer\/RA &#8212;\u000a      USG; and Ken Gibb &#8212; Professor USG (research fellow at the time) developed\u000a      LHSA in partnership with staff at Scottish Homes (which became\u000a        `Communities Scotland' in 2002). Key partners were Dr. Tony\u000a      O'Sullivan, then Head of Research and Planning at Scottish Homes (who\u000a      subsequently became Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the University of\u000a      Glasgow in 2004 and who was appointed Honorary Professor in 2010) and\u000a      Gillian Young, then Head of Business Intelligence at Scottish Homes.\u000a    The University of Glasgow researchers made a unique and significant\u000a      contribution to the research process given their strong body of expertise\u000a      in housing economics, housing planning and the geography of housing\u000a      systems. The initial LHSA framework was largely developed by Maclennan and\u000a      O'Sullivan with subsequent major contributions from Gibb, More and Young.\u000a      The key contributions by Glasgow academics were threefold: in terms of the\u000a      framework's evolving conceptual and practical underpinnings; revising that\u000a      framework as more data became available and policy\/practice needs evolved;\u000a      and close application through case studies and, in particular, training of\u000a      housing and planning professionals so that they could use the model\u000a      effectively.\u000a    LHSA was a comprehensive response to significant conceptual and empirical\u000a      gaps in housing planning and practice in Scotland and elsewhere. In\u000a      developing the model of LHSA, the Glasgow University researchers argued\u000a      that a local housing system is not one that should be solely defined by\u000a      local authority administrative boundaries. Instead, it was their\u000a      contention, wholly novel at the time, that a local housing system should\u000a      be understood as a largely self-contained or independent area, one defined\u000a      by consumer behaviour and choices (expressed by property sale and\u000a      purchase, household movement, etc.) rather than administrative fiat. The\u000a      scale and direction of these flows, the researchers argued, would depend\u000a      on the impact of various forces or drivers, some of which might arise in\u000a      the wider environment (e.g. economic and demographic change) and others\u000a      from within the housing system itself (turnover, price change, housing\u000a      quality, etc). Their research insights revealed that it is a combination\u000a      of these flows and wider forces that influence the shape of the local\u000a      housing system over time and space. Central and novel to the framework was\u000a      the fundamental interdependence of different parts of the housing system:\u000a      renting and owning, private and social housing. As a result of this, they\u000a      highlighted that it is vital for housing planners to be aware of and\u000a      understand these flows or processes in order to consider how to intervene\u000a      effectively to address key imbalances or systemic local problems.\u000a    LHSA embraced planning, demography and economic analysis of the drivers\u000a      of housing systems, focusing on all tenures and their interdependence\u000a      within a well-defined housing market area. Undertaking an LHSA required\u000a      housing planners to undertake a rigorous data audit so that they could map\u000a      out the external and internal drivers of their housing system, having\u000a      clarified the appropriate geography and located the analysis in its\u000a      broader spatial and economic planning context. Not only did this help set\u000a      objectives, the data audit element may also justify a mixed methods\u000a      approach utilising qualitative methods where key quantitative information\u000a      was absent. Working through the LHSA framework allowed the planner to then\u000a      identify key problems or imbalances which were the essential outputs of\u000a      the process and which in turn informed investment decisions.\u000a    This marked a new approach to the analysis and working definition of\u000a      local housing systems and signalled a change away from tenure-based\u000a      partial analysis of how housing provision is assessed.\u000a    * All positions relate to the time of the research, unless\u000a        otherwise stated.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20945","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The depth and diversity of the research differentiated it from the\u000a      largely incidental treatment of territoriality in the existing literature,\u000a      communicating a new understanding about the relationship between young\u000a      people, place, and violent behaviours to both policy makers and the\u000a      public.\u000a    Transforming popular understandings of youth gangs and violence\u000a    The research significantly contributed to public understandings about the\u000a      roots of youth gangs at a time when there was rising concern about rates\u000a      of violent deaths. This impact was achieved through a range of publicity\u000a      activities and substantial media coverage.\u000a    The project pages on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation website have received\u000a      15,500 hits, with approximately 1,600 copies of the report downloaded. On\u000a      publication the research was featured by over 300 media outlets, including\u000a      The Daily Mirror, The Independent, The Daily Express, The Times,\u000a      and The Herald. The Guardian (G2) published a two page\u000a      spread on territoriality based on the report, as well as news coverage and\u000a      a comment column in the main paper.\u000a    Kintrea gave live news interviews to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, BBC Radio\u000a      Leeds and LBC (London) and interviews were also included in the TV\u000a      documentaries War on Knives (Sky 1, 14 and 21 October 2008) and Stabbed:\u000a        The Truth about Knife Crime (BBC 1, 20 January 2009). War on\u000a        Knives was the biggest-ever televised campaign to tackle knife\u000a      crime. Kintrea featured in the first of two 2-hour live programmes which\u000a      outlined the scale of the problem through films and expert interviews.\u000a      Kintrea was interviewed alongside a representative from the Violence\u000a      Reduction Unit and a victim of knife crime. Stabbed examined the\u000a      reasons behind knife crime through interviews with police, youth workers\u000a      and researchers, as well as teenagers and families of victims. Kintrea's\u000a      interview was used as context for footage of territorially-impacted young\u000a      people discussing why they carried knives.\u000a    In addition, a special exhibition, Nothing in the World but Youth,\u000a      at Turner Contemporary in Margate in 2011, featured cognitive maps drawn\u000a      by young people as part of research focus groups. The exhibition attracted\u000a      123,000 visitors and nearly 1,000 copies of the exhibition catalogue,\u000a      which included a contribution by Kintrea, were sold.\u000a    The Scottish Government research received significant media attention,\u000a      particularly in relation to findings about female gang members. It was\u000a      reported in articles in The Herald, The Sun, The Scotsman, and the\u000a        Evening Times as well as by Scottish Television (STV).\u000a    Informing policy on Gangs and Knife Crime\u000a    The research impacted on understandings of youth gangs held by policy\u000a      makers. Before the research was published, there were no national policy\u000a      interventions targeting the territorial aspect of gangs.\u000a    In 2008 a series of fatal stabbings urged the House of Commons Home\u000a      Affairs Committee to launch an Inquiry into Knife Crime, which reported in\u000a      June 2009. The research formed the basis of discussions at an\u000a      evidence-gathering seminar in Leeds, contributing to the Inquiry's\u000a      conclusion that `the rise in violent knife offences seen over the past\u000a        few years is associated with street violence between groups of young\u000a        people who share a territorial identity, often referred to as 'gangs'.\u000a    During the period of the Inquiry, the researchers delivered two seminars\u000a      at the Home Office (October 30th 2008; March 12th\u000a      2009). The first addressed civil servants from The Home Office and the\u000a      Department of Communities and Local Government, while the second,\u000a      organised by the Tackling Gangs Action Project (TGAP) within the Home\u000a      Office, was delivered to senior police officers, youth practitioners,\u000a      senior civil servants and partner agencies. Researchers also gave a\u000a      presentation to the Youth Justice Board in February 2009. During this\u000a      period, the research was quoted in the politically influential Centre for\u000a      Social Justice report Dying to Belong (2009).\u000a    According to the Head of Public Space Violence at the Home Office at the\u000a      time, the research contributed to their understanding of the nature of\u000a      gang violence, with its emphasis on how territoriality fuels much of this.\u000a      This helped to improve initial Home Office understanding of the problem at\u000a      the important stage of building an evidence base and formulating strategic\u000a      plans for TGAP.\u000a    There is now clear recognition of the central role of territoriality in\u000a      gangs, with the most recent policy document Ending Gang Violence: A\u000a        Cross Government Report describing case studies in exactly the same\u000a      terms as Kintrea et. al (2008). The introduction of gang injunctions in\u000a      England in 2011 is a direct response to the need to tackle territorial\u000a      violence.\u000a    Informing Scottish Government Policies on Young People and Knife\u000a          Crime\u000a    Prior to the research, there were few large-scale empirical studies of\u000a      gangs or knife carriers in the UK, and none in Scotland. The research\u000a      reports therefore filled important information gaps for the Scottish\u000a      Government and shaped its approach.\u000a    New insights included: statistical data about the backgrounds of gang\u000a      members and knife carriers; the different aetiologies and risk factors for\u000a      the two groups; and information about young women's involvement in gangs,\u000a      which is characterised more by victimisation than aggression. These\u000a      research findings have become reference points in policy meetings and\u000a      briefings within the Scottish Government. In addition, Jon Bannister was\u000a      invited to participate in a Scottish Government debate into knife crime in\u000a      January 2009. During the debate he drew from both research projects to\u000a      highlight the significance of territoriality to gang behaviour and also to\u000a      urge for more sustained funding to be dedicated to early intervention\u000a      projects.\u000a    According to Senior Researchers at the Scottish Government, the research\u000a      gave confidence to policy development around the Scottish Government's `No\u000a      Knives Better Lives' campaign, elements of the Community Initiative to\u000a      Reduce Violence (CIRV) and the Cashback for Communities programme. The\u000a      CIRV, in particular, has had great reported success in reducing the rate\u000a      of gang violence in Glasgow by 50% between 2008 and 2011.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    At a time when youth gangs were high on the UK and Scottish governments'\u000a      agendas and a focus of media concern, this research was instrumental in\u000a      changing understandings of the origins of youth gangs, and why they engage\u000a      in violent conflict. A key insight was that significant gang behaviour had\u000a      its origins in extreme forms of place attachment. The impact encompassed\u000a      changes in policy direction and programmes aimed at tackling youth\u000a      violence, including policies in Scotland such as `No Knives Better Lives'.\u000a      Through very substantial publicity, including coverage on 2 primetime TV\u000a      documentaries, the research informed public understandings, and challenged\u000a      conventional wisdom on the nature, organisation and behaviour of youth\u000a      gangs.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Glasgow\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Glasgow (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Glasgow","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007794}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    1.

These projects were preceded\u000a      by a feasibility study funded by the Scottish Executive in 2005.\u000a    A central focus of the studies is the role of territoriality as a\u000a      source of conflict. Territoriality was defined in the research as: a\u000a        situation in which a group claims an identifiable geographical area as\u000a        their own, and seeks to defend that area against others. This was\u000a      derived from R.D. Sack's Human Territoriality: Its Theory and History\u000a      (Cambridge University Press, 1986).\u000a    Project 1 was carried out in 2006-2008 by a team in Urban Studies\u000a      at Glasgow led by Keith Kintrea (Senior Lecturer (SL) in Housing Studies)*\u000a      and including Jon Bannister (SL in Public Policy), Jonathan Pickering\u000a      (Lecturer in Public Policy), Maggie Reid (Research Fellow) and Naofumi\u000a      Suzuki (Research Assistant). The study investigated the significance of\u000a      territoriality in the relationship between young people and place in\u000a      British cities; the incidence, origins and impacts of territoriality; and\u000a      how policy could best respond to it.\u000a    The research accessed informants through youth projects that were active\u000a      in six cities: Bradford, Bristol, Glasgow, Peterborough, Sunderland and\u000a      Tower Hamlets. Researchers interviewed 43 adults including project staff,\u000a      community workers, police, local authority youth service staff, local\u000a      activists and teachers. The team also conducted 15 focus groups with young\u000a      people including some who were involved directly with the projects and\u000a      others who were not.\u000a    The research led to a key insight that had not been recognised before in\u000a      the literature or policy about youth and place. It revealed that\u000a      territoriality among young people is found across the UK, and is a\u000a      significant source of disadvantage. Territoriality was shown to be rooted\u000a      in the culture of poor places. While it helps shape young people's\u000a      identities and provides them with the support of a friendship group, it\u000a      has many negative impacts. It not only cuts off disadvantaged young people\u000a      from opportunities &#8212; in education, work, leisure and personal\u000a      relationships &#8212; but also involves them in rivalry with groups from other\u000a      areas which often escalates to violence and criminality. The research\u000a      therefore showed that territoriality contributes to the exclusion of young\u000a      people from city life, and reduces their life chances.\u000a    Project 2 was led by Jon Bannister between 2008 and 2010. The team\u000a      also included Keith Kintrea and Jon Pickering from Urban Studies, plus\u000a      Glasgow colleagues Michele Burman (Professor of Criminology); Susan\u000a      Batchelor (Lecturer in Sociology), and Susan McVie (Edinburgh University).\u000a      The research sought reliable evidence about the nature, form and\u000a      prevalence of youth gangs and knife carrying in Scotland through\u000a      qualitative research with individuals engaged in services designed to\u000a      manage and challenge problematic youth behaviours. The research also\u000a      included interviews with a large sample of young people in five case study\u000a      locations: Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and West Dunbartonshire.\u000a    The research revealed critical insights into gang behaviours and\u000a      activities in Scotland.

This\u000a      national support has\u000a      been fundamental in gaining the financial and procedural support of the\u000a      European Union and the\u000a      European Parliament. The project has provided a model for the European\u000a      Commission\/Council of\u000a      Europe initiative in the Caucasus\/Black Sea region: the Kyiv Initiative\u000a      Regional Programme which\u000a      covers Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan &#8212; ministers from\u000a      these countries\u000a      signed up to the methodology at the Conference of Ministers of Culture on\u000a      Rehabilitating our\u000a      Common Heritage, Ljubljana 2009, organised as part of the Slovenian\u000a      Chairmanship of the Council\u000a      of Europe Committee of Ministers. (The author had been involved in\u000a      methodological discussions in\u000a      both Armenia and Georgia at an earlier stage of the Kyiv Initiative before\u000a      the adoption of this\u000a      project methodology).\u000a    Institutional\u000a    The project has enabled the adoption of new methodological tools within\u000a      the countries, enabling\u000a      national authorities to develop structured approaches to the\u000a      identification of buildings and sites at\u000a      risk, with reasoned, costed proposals for their rehabilitation. It has\u000a      also encouraged the\u000a      development of databases based on Council of Europe documentation\u000a      standards (Council of\u000a      Europe, Guidance on Inventory and Documentation of the Cultural\u000a        Heritage, Strasbourg 2001, by\u000a      John Bold et al) and the translation of those standards into national\u000a      languages.\u000a    Social\u000a    The traditional approach to investment in historic buildings in\u000a      South-East Europe was confined to\u000a      the official responsible bodies. The initial intention of the project was\u000a      to broaden the pool of\u000a      expertise and then to broaden participation to involve more potential\u000a      stakeholders in rehabilitation\u000a      projects. As a result, there has been a greatly-increased involvement of\u000a      local communities in\u000a      questions of heritage-led regeneration as a result of their recognition of\u000a      the benefits and\u000a      responsibilities which relate to the cultural heritage. There has been\u000a      significant attendance at\u000a      meetings to discuss the future of individual buildings and sites, as well\u000a      as participation in project\u000a      boards and attendance at European heritage days. All the major flagship\u000a      projects have required\u000a      the appointment of project boards drawn from local government and the\u000a      local business\u000a      communities. They have contributed to decision-making on the future\u000a      development of sites with\u000a      a view to encouraging community involvement, investment and tourism. The\u000a      author has been\u000a      involved in explaining the methodology and aims of the Ljubljana Process\u000a      to stakeholders and in\u000a      leading project board discussions in Kosovo, Montenegro and Romania.\u000a    Economic\u000a    There has been a significantly strengthened recognition of the economic\u000a      value of the heritage as\u000a      a social benefit, as an investment opportunity and as a spur to tourism.\u000a      The long-term viability of\u000a      the conversion of historic buildings to new sustainable uses is now better\u000a      understood, together with\u000a      the recognition that rehabilitation of buildings and sites offers both\u000a      business and community\u000a      benefits. The encouragement through the project of national, international\u000a      public and private\u000a      funding for sites from Ministries of Culture, the European Union and\u000a      numerous national\u000a      governments, institutions and private foundations has been profound. The\u000a      agreement of the EU to\u000a      fund the Ljubljana Process from 2008 signalled their recognition of the\u000a      project achievements.\u000a      Further funding was agreed by the European Parliament. The continuing\u000a      support of the EU is\u000a      demonstrated by their continued funding of the Ljubljana Process 2 through\u000a      the Directorate for\u000a      Enlargement (which is able to provide advice and funding to\u000a      `pre-accession' countries which will in\u000a      due course become members of the EU).\u000a    By the end of 2010, over 76 million euros had been allocated or promised\u000a      (by the EU, the\u000a      European Parliament, international agencies, other governments and the\u000a      governments of the\u000a      participating countries) by which time over 80% of the 186 sites had\u000a      undergone, or were\u000a      undergoing various levels of stabilisation, restoration or conversion.\u000a      Most of this funding followed\u000a      the boost to the project given by greater EU involvement from 2008. The\u000a      methodology of the\u000a      project had very consciously from the beginning included the\u000a      project-specific questions which are\u000a      posed by funding agencies. The author participated in meetings with both\u000a      the Council of Europe\u000a      Development Bank and the World Monuments Fund to enable appropriate\u000a      refinement of the\u000a      methodology.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The IRPP\/SAAH (also known as the Ljubljana Process) is part of the\u000a      Council of Europe's\u000a      Regional Programme in S.E.

It was designed to establish\u000a      methodologies for heritage-led\u000a      rehabilitation in countries undergoing political, social and economic\u000a      transition: improving heritage\u000a      management practices; increasing ministerial acceptance of responsibility\u000a      for the built heritage\u000a      which had been lost in the new world, post-communist order; establishing a\u000a      transferrable model;\u000a      and fund-raising for the rehabilitation of a wide range of sites,\u000a      encouraging new sustainable uses\u000a      and jobs. The project has had significant financial impact, raising over\u000a      76m euros by the end of\u000a      2010, by which time over 80% of the 186 identified sites had undergone or\u000a      were undergoing\u000a      rehabilitation. Its methodology has been endorsed by the European\u000a      Commission which as a\u000a      consequence has increased its funding for heritage sites as part of its\u000a      pre-accession programme.\u000a      Within the participating countries the programme has been fully endorsed\u000a      by ministers of culture,\u000a      and has received significant further endorsement from the ministers of\u000a      culture within the countries\u000a      of the Caucasus which are participating in the Kyiv Initiative Regional\u000a      Programme.

The programme\u000a      received financial support\u000a      from the European Commission. The beneficiary countries are Albania,\u000a      Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina,\u000a      Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro,\u000a      Romania and Serbia,\u000a      including Kosovo. The IRPP\/SAAH is one of three components of the\u000a      programme. Following the\u000a      allocation of more EU funding in 2008, it became known as the Ljubljana\u000a      Process. It is ongoing.\u000a    Initial research was carried out on the ground by a team of three,\u000a      including the project leader,\u000a      working with national authorities to investigate the heritage and its\u000a      management in each country:\u000a      the main characteristics of the heritage; the degree to which it was\u000a      threatened; the management\u000a      structures (policies, responsibilities, numbers of staff, training,\u000a      strengths and weaknesses);\u000a      legislation; national and international partnerships; funding;\u000a      documentation; education; the\u000a      relationship between heritage and planning; social aspects including\u000a      ethnicity. All of the findings\u000a      were published by the Council of Europe in Heritage Assessment reports,\u000a      all of which were either\u000a      written by, or edited by, the project leader, in association with the\u000a      national representatives.\u000a    The countries were then encouraged to produce Prioritised Intervention\u000a      Lists of significant sites at\u000a      risk and in need of funding for rehabilitation. The assessment of relative\u000a      significance and the\u000a      assigning of priorities for funding were new approaches in South East\u000a      Europe which required\u000a      training from the project leader and colleagues. Also new was the\u000a      encouragement to view the\u000a      heritage more broadly, beyond the major religious monuments and\u000a      archaeological sites, to include\u000a      urban and rural ensembles and infrastructural and industrial monuments:\u000a      notable among these\u000a      was the Senje Coal Mine, Serbia, which is situated in an area of natural\u000a      beauty and is now being\u000a      redeveloped with local community participation as a mining heritage\u000a      centre, with an hotel for\u000a      visitors to both the industrial and natural landscapes, and encouraging\u000a      the return of those who had\u000a      lost their jobs when mining was run-down. A comparable strategy of\u000a      encouraging the return of the\u000a      displaced, in this case the result of ethnic conflict, underpins the\u000a      reconstruction (ongoing) of the\u000a      Aladza Mosque at Foca, Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u000a    Guidance was provided in the compilation of the lists but fuller guidance\u000a      including field trips to visit\u000a      sites followed with the compilation of Preliminary Technical Assessments.\u000a      The project leader and a\u000a      team of international experts assessed a range of aspects of the building\u000a      or site, the projects in\u000a      hand or proposed for its rehabilitation, potential future uses and costs.\u000a      This assessment was\u000a      followed by more detailed Business Plans, again guided by the project\u000a      leader and Council of\u000a      Europe experts.\u000a    This process took place over the period 2003-08, during which time 186\u000a      buildings and sites were\u000a      identified, providing a broad cross-section of the significant built\u000a      heritage of the Balkans, identified\u000a      by the national experts, following the methodology provided by the project\u000a      leader and colleagues.\u000a      The project methodology was published as a Council of Europe guidance\u000a      book, written by the\u000a      project leader, Guidance on Heritage Assessment (Strasbourg,\u000a      2005).\u000a    The further allocation of European Commission funding in 2008 enabled a\u000a      greater concentration\u000a      on a smaller number of 26 `flagship projects', through the `Ljubljana\u000a      Process'. This continued until\u000a      December 2010, when the project leader stepped down. Further Heritage\u000a      Assessments and\u000a      Impact Assessments were carried out in 2010, within the countries\u000a      themselves by the national\u000a      representatives, guided by the project leader and colleagues, with further\u000a      on-site assessment by\u000a      members of the Raymond Lemaire International Centre for Conservation,\u000a      Leuven. The introduction\u000a      of the Ljubljana Process in 2008 not only provided more funding for the\u000a      flagship sites but also\u000a      further inspired national governments to fund the other sites on the\u000a      national lists during the period\u000a      2008-10. The enthusiasm of the national governments of the countries of\u000a      South-East Europe for\u000a      the project was confirmed at a Conference of Ministers in Ljubljana 2009\u000a      when they strongly\u000a      endorsed the project and confirmed their full backing for the investment\u000a      process and the\u000a      associated management and monitoring structures, including the wider\u000a      involvement of local\u000a      communities: this involvement of local stakeholders in the planning\u000a      process and heritage-led\u000a      rehabilitation represented a new approach in the region, based on best\u000a      practice in western Europe.\u000a    The Ljubljana Process has continued since 2011 as the Ljubljana Process\u000a      II, managed by the\u000a      Regional Cooperation Council based in Sarajevo, with the aim of further\u000a      institutionalising the\u000a      methodology and further enabling national authorities to oversee the\u000a      political sustainability of the\u000a      project. The methodology devised and developed by the project leader and\u000a      colleagues has been\u000a      adopted in its entirety for this new phase, with the addition of some\u000a      refinements in the business\u000a      planning process. The methodology was also endorsed for application in\u000a      their own countries\u000a      through the Kyiv Initiative Regional Programme by the ministers of culture\u000a      of the Caucasus\u000a      (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) who attended the\u000a      Ljubljana Conference in 2009.\u000a      This project is also continuing, employing the methodology in urban\u000a      rehabilitation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21446","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Newcastle University staff have a long track record in providing research\u000a      insights on aspects of collaborative planning. The primary purpose of this\u000a      research is as a mirror on society, allowing it to reflect on, and in time\u000a      to reframe its thinking about, its practices. Its impact, then, is firstly\u000a      when society reflects upon the research insights, secondly if this causes\u000a      them to change their thinking about their practices, and thirdly if this\u000a      ultimately leads to tangible changes of practice and thus planning\u000a      outcomes.\u000a    Over many years, including during the 2008 - 2013 impact period,\u000a      Newcastle staff (but particularly Healey) have ensured that the research\u000a      insights have been diffused to a wide range of leading planners and\u000a      politicians, as a first stage of impact. This has been effected by\u000a      ensuring research outputs have been promoted to such people and from the\u000a      standing afforded to Newcastle University research by the planning elite.\u000a      For example, when receiving the RTPI's Gold Medal (its highest award for\u000a      contributions to the profession, only awarded twice in the last 30 years\u000a      and Healey the only ever female recipient) Healey used the opportunity to\u000a      promote the research insights accumulated at Newcastle through her\u000a      address. Healey was also the senior editor of the RTPI journal Planning\u000a        Theory and Practice until 2009 and was associate editor of the RTPI\u000a      Library Book Series from 2009-2013. The standing of the research is\u000a      evidenced by the profession. For example, the Vice-Chair of the TCPA in\u000a      2011 referred to Healey, Davoudi, Hull and Vigar as `influential voices in\u000a      planning' (IMP1); and the 2008 president of the RTPI describes the\u000a      `major contribution' Healey made to linking academic planners and\u000a      practitioners (IMP2).\u000a    Research insights have been considered by a wide range of people\u000a      associated with planning, some of whom have gone on to promote ideas of\u000a      collaborative planning in other parts of the world. Activities in this\u000a      vein would include the mentoring of postgraduate students, and addresses\u000a      at events such as Planning Summer Schools, RTPI events and lectures at\u000a      Young Planners conferences.\u000a    Newcastle research insights and their discussion by planning elites have\u000a      clearly progressed to make significant changes in thinking. Friedman\u000a      (2008), identifies three shifts in planning and practices the first of\u000a      which is \"toward making planning more of a whole-society process\u000a      rather than primarily a technical one (e.g., Healey, 2007, 280-282)\"\u000a      (p.254) (IMP3), and Albrechts (2009) claims that \"there is ample\u000a      evidence that the concepts developed, theorized and opened up to spatial\u000a      planning by Healey do travel. They travel not only in academia but also in\u000a      the world of practice\" (p.145) (IMP4).\u000a    Promoting planning as a whole-society spatial activity as conceptualised\u000a      by Healey is now commonplace among the leading planning practice\u000a      organisations in the UK. For example, the TCPA's Chief Planner said\u000a      \"Collaborative Planning is a theory that has now become de rigeur\u000a      practice\" (IMP5). Similarly, ideas of collaborative planning have\u000a      pervaded government thinking for the last decade, most recently evidenced\u000a      by the chapter on this in the Conservative manifesto `Open Source\u000a      Planning' (a precursor to the Localism Act) (IMP6).\u000a    The substantial revision of the English planning system in 2004 was\u000a      informed by the Newcastle research of the mid\/ late 1990s and early 2000s.\u000a      The research had defined the need for a return to the visioning aspect of\u000a      the system present in the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act and had\u000a      pointed to its re-emergence in certain places. The 2004 Act created Local\u000a      Development Frameworks (LDFs), which although introduced prior to the\u000a      impact period, are highly significant as the plans created as a result\u000a      continue today as the `core' spatial planning strategy for each local\u000a      authority area and hence have significant impact in the 2008-2013 period.\u000a      Very much in line with the concept of collaborative planning they aim to\u000a      address social, environmental and economic issues as well as land-use\u000a      issues per se, to be participative, and to integrate and help\u000a      deliver other strategies and policies. During the period before the 2004\u000a      Act, Healey had an advisory role to ODPM as a member of the steering group\u000a      for their scoping study on LDFs and was involved in associated discussions\u000a      with the civil servants drawing up the legislation (IMP7). Of\u000a      particular note was her influence on the requirement on planning\u000a      authorities to seek consensus on essential issues early in the process of\u000a      LDF preparation, by the comprehensive involvement of the fullest possible\u000a      range of interested parties.\u000a    Not only is this principle of collaborative planning continuing in LDFs\u000a      under the Coalition government, it is also evident in the planning\u000a      approaches they have introduced. \"Both through a \"localism\" agenda driven\u000a      from constituency and local government roots, and from a \"growth agenda\u000a      with more business foundations, there is even now increased interest in\u000a      drawing together sectors of resource investment at more local scales than\u000a      the nation-state; an approach which would, as the Royal Town Planning\u000a      Institute is arguing in its profession-based current research, enhance the\u000a      effectiveness of spatial planning\" (IMP7).\u000a    The concept of collaborative planning has also had global reach. Healey,\u000a      Davoudi and Vigar were commissioned by UN Habitat to write a chapter for\u000a      the UN Global Report on Human Settlements 2009 (IMP8). In this\u000a      they were able to assert the themes of collaborative planning to UN\u000a      Habitat audiences &#8212; elite policymakers in the global south &#8212; allowing them\u000a      to reflect upon these ideas. The underpinning research is globally held in\u000a      high esteem and has informed the work of many academics working to affect\u000a      change in their local contexts (IMP3, IMP4). Most recently, a\u000a      number of Healey's papers have been translated into Chinese. According to\u000a      Professor Bing Zhang, Chief Planner at the China Academy of Urban Planning\u000a      and Design (a scientific research institution under the Ministry of\u000a      Construction of PR China), `Healey's research achievements on urban\u000a      planning have had a sustained influence on planning theory and practice in\u000a      China during the last two decades' (IMP9).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Newcastle has made a significant contribution to the\u000a      development of strategic and local planning practice in the UK and\u000a      globally.

As part of a wider movement for a communicative\u000a      approach to understanding planning activity, this consolidated a shift in\u000a      thinking from planning as largely a technical-rational process undertaken\u000a      principally by an elite of professional planners, to a networked activity\u000a      intended to resolve place-based challenges by integrating not only various\u000a      actors in planning and the resources available in governmental\u000a      organisations, but also incorporating local people as an equal partner in\u000a      policy- and decision-making processes. Research in this vein was\u000a      particularly evident at Newcastle University during the 1990s and 2000s.\u000a      It involved a number of staff, particularly Patsy Healey (Professor,\u000a      Emeritus Professor), but also Simin Davoudi (Research Associate, 1989-96;\u000a      Professor, 2006-) and Geoff Vigar (Research Associate, 1995-8; 2000 &#8212;\u000a      Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Professor).\u000a    In the 1990s, a number of in-depth empirical studies were undertaken of\u000a      urban partnerships and land-use planning through which the detailed nature\u000a      of the relational dynamics in governance practices for urban development\u000a      were explored. For example, as part of the ESRC Research Project Urban\u000a        Governance, Institutional Capacity and Regenerating City Centres,\u000a      Healey led a team studying the Grainger Town Initiative, a partnership\u000a      project to regenerate the C19th core of Newcastle City Centre (1).\u000a      An ESRC-funded project Development Plans and the Regulatory Form of\u000a        the Planning System (1995-1997) developed empirical work in a\u000a      similar vein but linked an institutionalist focus more closely to the\u000a      English statutory planning system. It explored the social relations of\u000a      strategic spatial planning processes in England and identified the ways in\u000a      which highly centralised and sectoral policy agendas and processes\u000a      inhibited the achievement of innovation, inclusion and environmental\u000a      sustainability. The subsequent book argued for a return to more proactive\u000a      planning system centred on developing a shared local vision using the\u000a      tools of forward plans. It also identified that pressure from other\u000a      spheres, including a development industry eager for greater certainty in\u000a      strategic planning, had sown the seeds of such a system (3). Such\u000a      research fed into Healey's landmark book Collaborative Planning:\u000a        Shaping Places in Fragmented Societies (2), first published\u000a      in 1997 (second edition 2006). Its aim was to promote new ways of managing\u000a      collective concerns about the qualities of shared places and local\u000a      environments. The book emphasised the multiple webs of relations through\u000a      which both places and policies are `constructed' and urged greater\u000a      recognition of the range and complexity of stakeholders and issues\u000a      involved, and the need for planning practice to reflect on the power\u000a      structures and relations at work within processes of spatial change. It\u000a      promoted an ethic of inclusion and a commitment to participative\u000a      processes, arguing that these practices enable policies and projects to be\u000a      based on the best possible understanding of relevant material conditions,\u000a      values and interests.\u000a    Research in the early 2000s contributed to the refinement of the theory\u000a      of collaborative planning by focusing on specific conceptual and empirical\u000a      aspects. For example, the EU FPV SINGOCOM project (Healey, Frank Moulaert\u000a      2002-08; Vigar) further developed the concept of institutional capacity (4)\u000a      in planning and urban governance (5). Here, empirical work\u000a      comparing urban regeneration projects in the UK with others in Europe\u000a      highlighted the lack of local institutional capacity in English local\u000a      government explained through the continuing centrism and highly\u000a      sectoralised nature of the English polity.\u000a    Healey's 2007 book Urban Complexity and Spatial Strategy: Towards a\u000a        Relational Planning for our Times (6) brings together\u000a      aspects of this work, making further theoretical in-roads in part through\u000a      the deployment of three international case studies funded by the\u000a      Leverhulme Trust. It develops the themes of collaborative planning set out\u000a      previously, with particular emphasis of how concepts from urban geography\u000a      can be mobilised in thinking about development processes and how these\u000a      affect the capacity to transform power relations and achieve shared\u000a      objectives for qualities of place. It again highlighted the deficiencies\u000a      of English local governance and planning practice although noted how\u000a      through mobilising the power of collaborative networks planners could get\u000a      things done and make places better. Thus, as in Healey's previous work,\u000a      reflexive planners found hope and practical lessons as to how to mobilise\u000a      planning systems to achieve a common good.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21450","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As a direct result of the underpinning research, two products, NBS\u000a      Scheduler and NBS Create, were developed by NBS. Both have impact in the\u000a      2008-2013 period, NBS Scheduler as a continuation and development of its\u000a      initial impact and NBS Create as a new product impacting on professional\u000a      practice. Both products are targeted at SMEs (although NBS Create is used\u000a      by large companies as well) which need to work seamlessly to provide high\u000a      quality buildings, sometimes in collaboration with large construction\u000a      firms which usually have dedicated in-house facilities. Each product\u000a      allows the incorporation of up-to-date industry standards, regulations and\u000a      codes for the UK and represents rare examples of University-developed\u000a      prototypes making it not only to market, but to become market leaders.\u000a    NBS Scheduler\u000a    NBS Scheduler is marketed by NBS and was launched in 2001. It enables\u000a      users to write schedules of work for refurbishment, alteration and\u000a      new-build projects without bills of quantities, and facilitates the\u000a      creation of a three-part document consisting of preliminaries, a\u000a      specification and priceable schedule of work for use on building projects.\u000a      NBS Scheduler is designed to deal with smaller construction projects and\u000a      is thus targeted at small to medium firms, which constitute the majority\u000a      of firms in the construction industry (RIBA estimate that small\u000a      architectural practices (with less than 6 employees) constitute three\u000a      quarters of the UK total (3)). These firms usually do not have the\u000a      resource to develop bespoke software for such tasks (which are\u000a      time-consuming and can lead to errors and delays on projects if not\u000a      written accurately). The facility to use products like Scheduler is\u000a      therefore a tremendous benefit to a key component of the UK economy, as it\u000a      allows firms to quickly develop construction information in a structured\u000a      and standardised format that is compatible with other building related\u000a      software (e.g. AutoCAD). Clients subscribe to the service which allows\u000a      continuous updates from the national standard specification system for the\u000a      UK. The impact of the software was immediately apparent and by 2011, 570\u000a      British firms had a current subscription for the software with\u000a      subscriptions to Scheduler accounting for c.&#163;300,000 income per annum (IMP1).\u000a    One of the users of NBS Scheduler is Architectural Co-operative, which\u000a      works with communities to improve the design and construction of the built\u000a      environment. They use the software to complete domestic refurbishment\u000a      projects. Their director confirms that NBS Scheduler enables them to write\u000a      schedules of work quickly and easily and keeps them up to date with the\u000a      latest British standards, contracts, building regulations and codes since\u000a      the software is designed to be regularly updated (IMP2). Robert\u000a      Turner of Robert Turner Associates (a Chartered Building Surveying\u000a      practice) confirms that his business \"has benefited enormously by using\u000a      NBS Scheduler\" because it has \"aided in eliminating oversights in the\u000a      specification\" and minimised \"the risk...of...specification writing\u000a      [allowing] the specifier to concentrate on the task in hand\" (IMP3);\u000a      and The Martin Design Partnership (an architectural design consultancy)\u000a      use NBS Scheduler for its ease of use and ability to produce schedules\u000a      quickly and accurately. They affirm that in order to maintain their high\u000a      standards of documentation, they rely on NBS Scheduler for producing high\u000a      quality accurate schedules (IMP4). Other companies like MDBCS (IMP5)\u000a      (building surveying), and Russes and Turner (architectural design) have\u000a      also acknowledged that in order to maintain their high standards of\u000a      documentation, they rely on NBS Scheduler for producing high quality\u000a      accurate schedules.\u000a    The reach and significance of NBS Scheduler in the UK Construction\u000a      industry is further demonstrated by the fact that drawing and modelling\u000a      software developers such as ArchiCAD have developed tools to communicate\u000a      with NBS Scheduler which makes NBS Scheduler available with just a\u000a      mouse-click from ArchiCAD (IMP6). Further evidence of the reach of\u000a      this software is that producers of different materials and construction\u000a      related items find it advantageous for them to be included in the database\u000a      of NBS Scheduler and they mention this on their advertisements and\u000a      websites: e.g. Neaco, FAKRO, CMS ACOUSTICS, Axess2, Bituchem Asphalt LTD,\u000a      and Stratatiles (IMP7).\u000a    NBS Create\u000a    In addition to the direct impact created through the use of NBS\u000a      Scheduler, the research underpinning its development has also led to the\u000a      development of a more recent software product (NBS Create), launched in\u000a      2011 to the engineering services market, with releases of architecture,\u000a      structure and landscape libraries in March 2012. The Executive Director\u000a      for RIBA Enterprises states that: \"the information modelling undertaken\u000a      for NBS Scheduler...served as a platform for the development of the new\u000a      NBS Create product,\" and is based on \"the underlying information model\u000a      that is an extension\/development of the model in [NBS] Scheduler\" (IMP8).\u000a      In a website description, he expressed his belief that NBS Create \"is the\u000a      most advanced specification modelling system in the world\" (IMP9)\u000a      and his view has been endorsed by the industry: in the 2013 Construction\u000a      News Awards, NBS Create won the Digital Built Britain Award (IMP10).\u000a      The Executive Director of RIBA goes on to say that it is a \"built-for-BIM\u000a      [Building Information Modelling] specification system\"; which \"...meets\u000a      both the current needs for a flexible specification system...and delivers\u000a      information in the structured format required for BIM\" (IMP9). As\u000a      at June 2013, 235 companies had current subscriptions for this product (IMP8).\u000a      One of the subscribers (EPR Architects) comments that it allows them \"to\u000a      write comprehensive and technically proficient specifications\", and\u000a      \"improves the efficiency of the [design, construction detailing and\u000a      specification] process and reduces the opportunities for mistakes\" (IMP2).\u000a    Both NBS Scheduler and NBS Create represent exemplars of how academic\u000a      research can develop into prototypes and then marketable products. These\u000a      software products are widely used by small firms in the industry and have\u000a      made invaluable improvements to their practices. The underpinning research\u000a      is therefore making a sustained impact in the UK construction industry and\u000a      thus the productivity of the wider UK economy.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research in information modelling at Newcastle University's School of\u000a      Architecture, Planning and Landscape, supported by research grants and\u000a      industry funding, led to the development of a software prototype and\u000a      subsequently to a market software application (NBS Scheduler). This\u000a      product is particularly targeted at SMEs in the construction industry with\u000a      a design capability and for them it has become best-practice software.

Of particular relevance is the\u000a      work by staff in the Construction Informatics Research\u000a      Centre\/Architectural Informatics Group at Newcastle University between\u000a      1990 and 2002, particularly Stephen Lockley (RA, Lecturer and Professor,\u000a      1985-2002, Visiting Professor 2013-), Ming Sun (RA and Lecturer,\u000a      1990-1996), Richard Watson (RA and Lecturer, 1999-2002) and Sameh Shaaban\u000a      (RA, 1999-2002).\u000a    The design and construction of buildings involves a wide range of\u000a      professionals and firms that work together in unique `one-off' projects to\u000a      create buildings and other assets. The involvement of many firms allows\u000a      for flexibility and the scope to put together the best mix of skills to\u000a      deliver any project. However this fragmented structure can lead to\u000a      problems in the sharing and exchange of information between different\u000a      professionals and the software applications used by them. The need to\u000a      `integrate' the construction industry through, for example, the\u000a      development of standard ways of working, and software applications that\u000a      are interoperable (i.e. share and exchange information seamlessly), has\u000a      therefore been a longstanding and on-going need in the industry.\u000a    A key strategy in such construction integration is the use of Information\u000a      and Communication Technologies to: automate discrete activities in the\u000a      design and construction process; develop models and standards for the\u000a      representation and communication of building information between people\u000a      and different software applications; and facilitate `virtual'\u000a      collaborative working and the conduct of business electronically.\u000a    In the early 1990s, Newcastle University was a key member of the\u000a      Europe-wide COMBINE (Computer Models for the Building Industry in Europe)\u000a      1 and 2 projects, which were aimed at developing: workable computer\u000a      integrated building design systems; robust exchange systems for building\u000a      models, cost estimating tools, and the implementation of building\u000a      component database prototypes. Newcastle's involvement in the COMBINE 2\u000a      project (1993-1995) was to develop a \"Data Exchange System which provides\u000a      the underlying support for data exchange and data maintenance in an\u000a      integrated building design system...\" (1, 2).\u000a    Industry became interested in the outputs from this research and there\u000a      followed a period from 1995 to 2002 when more commercially-oriented\u000a      research and development was undertaken by Newcastle staff with funding\u000a      from RIBA Enterprises (National Building Specification) in particular. As\u000a      Watson, Lockley and Shaaban describe (3), this was \"to support the\u000a      creation, management and communication of project specification\u000a      information\": \"information that is communicated by the design team to the\u000a      contractor to enable the construction of a building project\". Research\u000a      activity in this area focused on \"the creation and population of\u000a      appropriate, re-usable information models...to provide a generic\u000a      information resource for the industry\" (3).\u000a    The outputs from this research directly led to the development of several\u000a      industry applications in conjunction with the National Building\u000a      Specification (NBS), who provided funding for these developments. In 2002\u000a      many members of the Newcastle University group became employed by NBS to\u000a      continue the development of software products based on their earlier\u000a      research. The impact case study described below focuses on two of the\u000a      products (NBS Scheduler, and subsequently, NBS Create) that resulted from\u000a      the underpinning research.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21451","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Academics at Newcastle have been successful in generating impact from\u000a      their research on cities and security in the 2008-2013 period, both in\u000a      their own rights and as lead partners in the Surveillance Studies Network\u000a      (SSN). Two types of impact of their work - on public debate, and on policy\u000a      formation - are described below.\u000a    Impacts on Public Debate, Awareness and Understanding\u000a    The cities and security research at Newcastle has impacted upon public\u000a      understanding and awareness of such issues. The most significant element\u000a      of this is the development of a research- informed lexicon, starting with\u000a      `splintering urbanism', and including research to support the idea of the\u000a      UK as a `surveillance society', to capture and communicate some of the\u000a      most fundamental processes underway in cities for consumption by public,\u000a      policy and research audiences. In addition: the founding of the SSN; the\u000a      founding, editing and contributions to its open access journal Surveillance\u000a        and Society; and the co-creation of SSN's four major international\u000a      conferences and a number of other networking events which have attracted\u000a      hundreds of delegates from both academic and non-academic backgrounds,\u000a      have all been contributions to the impact of Newcastle University's urban\u000a      security research.\u000a    The most significant vehicle for shaping public debate has, however, been\u000a      the publication of Graham's book, Cities under Siege: the New Military\u000a        Urbanism in 2010. Although written by an academic and drawing\u000a      heavily on his research, this book was produced and marketed for a much\u000a      wider target audience. At 31 July 2013, 3,500 copies of the English\u000a      edition had been sold, including 1,500 in the USA (IMP1).\u000a      Translations into many languages, including Mandarin, Arabic, German and\u000a      French are in progress or completed. The French version `Ville Sous\u000a      Contr&#244;l&#233;' has now sold 1200 copies. The global reach of the research\u000a      messages was enhanced by book reviews not only in the UK, but also in the\u000a      press of many other countries - for example, La D&#233;couverte (IMP2)\u000a      provides extracts from six prestigious French reviews; and a 4500 word\u000a      article for the United Arab Emirates newspaper, Alkhaleej (IMP3).\u000a      It was further promoted when Nicholas Lezard chose it as book of the week\u000a      in the Guardian (IMP4). \u000a    The high profile of Cities under Siege and the linkage of the\u000a      book's themes by many commentators to global events such as the Arab\u000a      Spring and movements such as `Occupy', which both had intensely urban\u000a      roots and impacts, meant that Graham's research insights were high profile\u000a      in the media. For example, he was the `talking head' for a major\u000a      documentary The Fear has a Thousand Eyes screened on the tenth\u000a      anniversary of the 9\/11 attacks on the main terrestrial channels in\u000a      Germany and Switzerland (IMP5), and was interviewed twice on the\u000a      influential US global daily news show, Democracy Now, to discuss\u000a      the Occupy `protests'. The Editor of the programme commented that \"his\u000a      book Cities Under Siege exposes like no other how cities are being remade\u000a      into security landscapes. His analysis in the first interview was so\u000a      insightful, and resonated so well with so many people around the world\u000a      involved in the protests, that we asked him back the next day for another\u000a      interview. We have repeated segments of hi[s] interviews several times\u000a      since they remain a remarkably incisive analysis of the current politics\u000a      of cities around the world\" (IMP6).\u000a    Such exposure of Graham's research insights have led to lively public\u000a      debate of his ideas. For example, more than 1,000 tweets are found in a\u000a      Twitter search using `Lockdown London Guardian', from the title of\u000a      Graham's Guardian article on the London Olympics 2012. It is also clear\u000a      that Graham's terminologies to describe his concepts such as `splintering\u000a      urbanism' and `new military urbanism' have become part of the lexicon of\u000a      public discourse. More than 500 tweets have used the `new military\u000a      urbanism' terminology (IMP7) to discuss issues of cities and\u000a      security, particularly when framing their arguments in terms of dissent.\u000a    Impacts on Policy Formation and Debate\u000a    Researchers at Newcastle have influenced the development of a regulatory\u000a      framework in the UK which addresses surveillance and information security.\u000a      The primary conduit of influence was two reports of the Surveillance\u000a      Studies Network (SSN).\u000a    The first report (2006) was co-ordinated by Murakami-Wood (5);\u000a      and Graham provided an `expert report' for the publication. The report was\u000a      the lead item on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme on 2 November 2006 and\u000a      featured heavily in news coverage of the time. The report was translated\u000a      into 5 languages, and sparked official inquiries by both the House of\u000a      Commons Home Affairs Committee and the House of Lords Constitution\u000a      Committee. Murakami Wood coordinated submissions from the Surveillance\u000a      Studies Network for both and gave a seminar at the House of Lords\u000a      introducing the range of surveillance technologies that they should\u000a      consider. He also gave oral evidence to the Lords' Committee cementing a\u000a      process whereby the term `surveillance society' became used in policy\u000a      debate throughout the World during the period to 2013.\u000a    The report was later submitted as evidence to the Home Affairs\u000a      Committee's Inquiry into the Surveillance Society in 2008 by SSN, but had\u000a      already had influence on that Inquiry: in Volume 1 of the Inquiry report\u000a      it refers to the SSN work in the introduction, stating that \"our aim was\u000a      not to duplicate that work but rather to build on it in exploring the\u000a      large strategic issues of concern to the general public\" (p.8) (IMP8).\u000a      From this central position in the Inquiry process, the findings of the SSN\u000a      report pervade the recommendations of the Home Affairs Committee, and\u000a      where these were accepted by government, formed the basis of revisions to\u000a      the regulatory process. According to the Information Commissioner, the\u000a      report had \"led to increased parliamentary, media and public interest in\u000a      the increased surveillance of people's daily lives\" (p.2) (IMP9).\u000a      The report contributed to the debate that fed into the UK elections in\u000a      2010 where surveillance became for the first time a national election\u000a      issue.\u000a    The second, updated, SSN report in 2010 (Wood and Graham as two of the\u000a      six authors) was included as Part B of the Information Commissioner's 2010\u000a      Annual report to the House of Commons (IMP9), and described as\u000a      \"the centrepiece of this report\" (p.4), demonstrating the continuing\u000a      influence SSN research has had on the Information Commissioner's Office.\u000a      The Information Commissioner's report was presented to the Home Affairs\u000a      Committee on 11 November 2010 and received national media attention - for\u000a      example, the Guardian (IMP10) - so furthering Parliamentary and\u000a      public understanding of the surveillance research insights raised by Wood,\u000a      Graham and SSN colleagues. It was incorporated into the ICO's annual\u000a      report to the House of Commons in 2011 and remains highly influential in\u000a      policy and public discourse.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Two decades of research in the Global Urban Research Unit at Newcastle\u000a      University has significantly shaped public awareness and political\u000a      understanding of the links between technology, infrastructure and security\u000a      within highly urbanised societies. Research into the role of cities as key\u000a      sites of security and war and the spread of `the surveillance society' are\u000a      two interlocking foci that have generated impacts with global reach.

A key moment was the initiation of a research centre,\u000a      the Centre for Urban Technology (CUT), in 1994, led by a small group of\u000a      young researchers, in particular, Simon Guy (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer,\u000a      Professor to 2005); Simon Marvin (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, to 2001) and\u000a      Steve Graham (Lecturer, Reader, Professor to 2005; and Professor, 2010 -).\u000a      CUT's work made a major contribution to shifting the study of urban\u000a      infrastructure from an area dominated by very `technical' research, often\u000a      aligned with engineering and policy studies, to an exciting new focus for\u000a      urban and social theory. This in part reflected societal processes such as\u000a      the marketization of urban infrastructure, but also how CUT researchers\u000a      were able to conceptualise infrastructure as `Urban Technology' and apply\u000a      a new set of socio-technical ideas with which to consider its significance\u000a      to the politics of urban life. During the 1990s, CUT staff worked on a\u000a      number of funded research projects, including a very significant ESRC\u000a      e-society grant and a host of industry-funded projects with the likes of\u000a      British Telecom and major energy and water companies. This work cohered\u000a      into a substantial body of written scholarship including the seminal\u000a      publication, Splintering Urbanism (1), which placed a new\u000a      set of influential terminologies in the public domain, including the\u000a      phrase `splintering urbanism' itself. \u000a    In 2001, Graham took over the Directorship of CUT and led a merger with\u000a      two other centres to become the Global Urban Research Unit (GURU) at\u000a      Newcastle University in 2002. In 2001 David Murakami-Wood joined GURU as\u000a      Earl Grey Fellow on a project to examine Algorithmic Surveillance\u000a      (then Lecturer, 2004-09; Reader, 2009) and GURU's urban technology\u000a      research consolidated into a focus on cities and security, e.g. (2, 3,\u000a        4) which continues to the present day. Graham's British Academy\u000a      funded readership (2002-2004) The UK as a Software Sorted Society,\u000a      was a particular highlight demonstrating that the sites, spaces,\u000a      structures, symbols and experiences of cities and urban life were now\u000a      central to political struggles over security and surveillance. Graham and\u000a      Murakami-Wood in particular reinforced Newcastle University's position as\u000a      a lead organisation in cities and security research during this period,\u000a      with both heavily involved in the founding of the academic Surveillance\u000a      Studies Network (SSN) as well as being two of the five founding editors of\u000a      the open-access academic journal Surveillance and Society.\u000a      (Murakami- Wood as the Managing Editor).\u000a    GURU's work on urban security in the 2000s also included the &#8364;1m EU\u000a      funded Social Polis platform on cities and social cohesion (2007-10, with\u000a      Gilroy, Vigar from this UOA), wherein Murakami-Wood led a\u000a      trans-disciplinary work programme on urban security that included a number\u000a      of stakeholders from civil society, policy and industry in co-designing a\u000a      research programme. Murakami-Wood's ESRC Fellowship Cultures of Urban\u000a        Surveillance further consolidated GURU's work in this field.\u000a    The key research output in this period in terms of policy impact was\u000a      however the 2006 report (5) to the UK Information Commissioner's\u000a      Office (ICO) &#8212; the UK Government's surveillance regulator &#8212; on the\u000a      surveillance society and a series of follow-up publications; Murakami-Wood\u000a      led the four- person team of main authors drawing heavily on GURU's work\u000a      of the previous ten years.\u000a    In 2010, Graham returned to Newcastle University and published his major\u000a      book Cities under Siege (6), a culmination of his previous\u000a      eight year's research on cities and security. The book unites the normally\u000a      separate academic discourses around the urbanisation of security on the\u000a      one hand, and the politics of cities and urban life on the other, and is a\u000a      major expos&#233; of the tightening connections across the world between urban\u000a      life, militarism and security politics. In this \"the central role of\u000a      cities within the new imperialism - the resurgence of aggressive, colonial\u000a      militarism focusing on the violent appropriation of land and resources in\u000a      the South\" (p.xxviii) is emphasised. This is a scholarly publication, long\u000a      in the making, which draws directly from much of the cited research\u000a      undertaken during Graham's time at Newcastle and from research undertaken\u000a      at Newcastle in the 2005-10 period by others. For example, the use of the\u000a      term `Cities under Siege' to capture Graham's agenda first appears in\u000a      print in his 2006 article (4) written at Newcastle University and\u000a      the article's content is particularly apparent in chapter 2 `Manichean\u000a      Worlds'; a 2003 article Lessons in Urbicide (New Left Review) is\u000a      reproduced, in modified form, in chapter 7 of the same name; and the paper\u000a      in Critical Social Policy (2) heavily influences chapter 4\u000a      `Ubiquitous Borders'. The introduction of geopolitical thinking into his\u000a      earlier urban studies approach is obvious in some of his writing in the\u000a      early 2000s while at Newcastle, e.g. (3, 4) but his time at Durham\u000a      University (2005-2009) contributed to the book inasmuch as it honed\u000a      Graham's understanding of the critical geopolitical dimensions of his\u000a      earlier research and writing.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21452","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    An important opportunity to put the networked rural development approach\u000d\u000a      into practice on a significant scale arose in 2007, when Mark Shucksmith\u000d\u000a      was appointed Chair of the Scottish Government's Committee of Inquiry into\u000d\u000a      Crofting. Crofting is a distinctive and highly regulated form of land\u000d\u000a      tenure specific to the northern half of Scotland. It is also a cultural\u000d\u000a      heritage of major international significance. At the same time, there have\u000d\u000a      been years of decline in crofting and the Shucksmith Inquiry was charged\u000d\u000a      with ensuring it had a future.\u000d\u000a    Principles of networked rural development were central to the approach\u000d\u000a      and conduct of the Inquiry and the Inquiry Report, and thereby impacted on\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Government's Crofting Policy (2008) and the Crofting Reform\u000d\u000a      (Scotland) Act 2010 and are beginning to impact on changes in crofting\u000d\u000a      governance and to crofters lives. The networked rural development approach\u000d\u000a      was operationalized in the Inquiry as: allowing people in places more\u000d\u000a      control over the decisions made about them, and in the state adopting a\u000d\u000a      more enabling role.\u000d\u000a    The approach and conduct of the Inquiry during 2007 and 2008 was shaped\u000d\u000a      by Shucksmith's commitment to applying the insights from the research on\u000d\u000a      networked rural development. The Inquiry commissioned a review of evidence\u000d\u000a      of the effectiveness of rural development approaches from a researcher at\u000d\u000a      Newcastle University (Atterton), which summarised the contributions made\u000d\u000a      by researchers in CRE and elsewhere in developing the concept of\u000d\u000a      neo-endogenous rural development. Such knowledge from academia and other\u000d\u000a      `experts', though, was matched by a valorisation of the knowledge of local\u000d\u000a      people through a programme of local meetings which allowed them a\u000d\u000a      collective voice. The Director of the Scottish Crofting Foundation (now\u000d\u000a      Federation) was quoted in The Herald as saying \"There is no doubt the\u000d\u000a      authentic voice of Scottish crofters is in this report\" (IMP1).\u000d\u000a    The 2008 Inquiry report itself is explicit in drawing attention to the\u000d\u000a      Atterton research, with a summary of the commissioned review of research\u000d\u000a      forming one section of the Inquiry report (IMP2), and the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research explicitly referenced. Briefly, the Inquiry report\u000d\u000a      proposed local mobilisation and community empowerment in respect of both\u000d\u000a      regulation and development, supported by generative state action and by\u000d\u000a      refocused managerial technologies which would operate to encourage local\u000d\u000a      strategies and initiatives. These proposals illustrate how neo-endogenous\u000d\u000a      rural development and place-shaping might proceed in practice. Using the\u000d\u000a      neo-endogenous approach, the Inquiry sought to build the capacity of\u000d\u000a      crofting communities to mobilise strategically and collaboratively,\u000d\u000a      empowering communities at various levels.\u000d\u000a    The Environment Minister, responding to the Inquiry report (IMP3),\u000d\u000a      drew contrasts with the 1954 Taylor Inquiry into Crofting which emphasised\u000d\u000a      the need for initiative to come from outwith the crofting communities in\u000d\u000a      order to bring about change, a clear acknowledgement of its exogenous\u000d\u000a      development approach. Referring to the Shucksmith report he emphasised its\u000d\u000a      contrasting networked development approach: \"The principles of localism\u000d\u000a      and communality are central to the report's recommendations and, like the\u000d\u000a      committee of inquiry, I believe they are at the heart of crofting. The\u000d\u000a      Government believes strongly in empowering communities to take control of\u000d\u000a      their own destinies and in enabling people to make the plans and take the\u000d\u000a      decisions that affect them and their communities\". He went on to say that\u000d\u000a      any new governance structures should facilitate local input, reflecting\u000d\u000a      the need for supportive external networks for neo-endogenous development.\u000d\u000a    The Inquiry itself, the report, and the processes leading to policy and\u000d\u000a      governance change and enactment have stimulated debate, between local\u000d\u000a      people in meetings, in the media, and in the Scottish Parliament, so\u000d\u000a      extending the impact of the Newcastle research. As identified by a former\u000d\u000a      Chairman of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), \"Many of the\u000d\u000a      Shucksmith Report's proposals have been implemented in subsequent\u000d\u000a      legislation &#8212; which has resulted, as the report recommended, in the\u000d\u000a      formation of a largely elected Crofting Commission and in more vigorous\u000d\u000a      action being taken to deal with problems such as those arising from\u000d\u000a      crofter absenteeism and neglect of holdings\" (IMP4). The changes\u000d\u000a      to crofting law and governance emanating from the Shucksmith report are to\u000d\u000a      be found in the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010; the setting up of an\u000d\u000a      elected Crofting Commission in 2012 to replace the appointed Crofters\u000d\u000a      Commission; responsibility being passed to HIE for crofting development;\u000d\u000a      and implementation of a new definitive map-based crofting register.\u000d\u000a    The Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (IMP5, IMP6) in\u000d\u000a      particular enacts the proposals in the Shucksmith Report for radical\u000d\u000a      measures to extend the `place-shaping' neo-endogenous rural development\u000d\u000a      approach beyond those areas in which community buy-outs had occurred under\u000d\u000a      the earlier land reform legislation. The new Crofting Commission has six\u000d\u000a      of its nine Commissioners elected by Crofters, and sees its regulatory\u000d\u000a      role as having \"the potential to create stronger, more resilient,\u000d\u000a      ambitious, sustainable and culturally rich communities, and a well-managed\u000d\u000a      landscape and environment in the crofting areas\" (Crofting Commission,\u000d\u000a      para 20) (IMP7), so emphasising its focus on communities rather\u000d\u000a      than simply on individual crofters' rights. HIE has accommodated its new\u000d\u000a      crofting development responsibilities in its Strengthening Communities\u000d\u000a      division alongside the Community Land Unit, so underlining the commitment\u000d\u000a      of the new governance arrangements to empowered people in places, as\u000d\u000a      recommended in the Shucksmith Report.\u000d\u000a    The new systems of governance are still very new, but participatory\u000d\u000a      cultures are emerging: crofters are beginning to engage with processes\u000d\u000a      which seek to involve them in determining their futures (e.g., the\u000d\u000a      election of crofters onto the new Crofting Commission with local turnouts\u000d\u000a      of between a third and a half of crofters (IMP8)); and measures\u000d\u000a      are being introduced to encourage crofters to engage in local collective\u000d\u000a      action (e.g., the Scottish Government's encouragement of voluntary,\u000d\u000a      community-led mapping and registration rather than mandatory registration\u000d\u000a      by individuals (IMP9). A former Chairman of HIE said \"the overall\u000d\u000a      outcome [of the Shucksmith Inquiry] has been to give crofting a more\u000d\u000a      assured future.\" (IMP4). Similarly, the Minister told the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament that \"crofting is in a perilous state and we have an obligation\u000d\u000a      to ensure that it carries on into future generations. Mark Shucksmith and\u000d\u000a      his colleagues have done us a great service in helping us to ensure that\u000d\u000a      it does\" (IMP3).\u000d\u000a    While crofting is specific to Scotland, and the impact of the networked\u000d\u000a      development research can be tracked through the conduct of the Inquiry,\u000d\u000a      the Report findings, the policy and governance changes, and to the\u000d\u000a      engagement of crofters in determining their futures, in Scotland, the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research and the Inquiry's work have had influence beyond\u000d\u000a      this jurisdiction. The Irish Government recently launched an Inquiry into\u000d\u000a      land reform in rural Ireland, modelled on the Crofting Inquiry's work, and\u000d\u000a      presentations on both the research and the Crofting Inquiry's proposals\u000d\u000a      have been of interest to policy and practice users in Norway (Nationen,\u000d\u000a      9 September 2009, p.18) and England. In 2013, the report of the Crofting\u000d\u000a      Inquiry was translated into Japanese (IMP2) because \"Japan is a\u000d\u000a      country of peasants and community and is suffering from the same problems,\u000d\u000a      such as absenteeism. Grappling with the land problem in Scotland is a very\u000d\u000a      instructive experience to our society\" (IMP10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Crofting Reform Act 2010 and Scottish Government's Policy Statement\u000d\u000a      on Crofting 2008 implemented the main recommendations of the report of the\u000d\u000a      Committee of Inquiry on the Future of Crofting, chaired by Professor Mark\u000d\u000a      Shucksmith. The Inquiry itself was an example of a co-production approach\u000d\u000a      to the generation of knowledge for legal and policy application. The\u000d\u000a      report, in turn, was informed: by work of CRE researchers at Newcastle\u000d\u000a      University in the 1990s and 2000s on \"neo-endogenous rural development\";\u000d\u000a      by theories and studies of \"collaborative planning\" developed by planning\u000d\u000a      researchers in Newcastle University; and by Shucksmith's work, often\u000d\u000a      synthesising the two, from 2005. This body of research informed a major\u000d\u000a      overhaul of crofting legislation and governance in Scotland aimed at\u000d\u000a      reversing the decline of crofting as a social practice with major\u000d\u000a      territorial effects, and is actively debated in other countries as an\u000d\u000a      appropriate approach to rural development.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Newcastle University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Newcastle upon Tyne (University of)","InstitutionName":"Newcastle University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007799}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

This work has been developed further since 2005 by\u000d\u000a      Mark Shucksmith (Professor, 2005-), working across the School of\u000d\u000a      Architecture, Planning and Landscape (APL) and CRE, refining and promoting\u000d\u000a      both the conceptual framework and its implementation in policy and\u000d\u000a      practice (4, 5).\u000d\u000a    The concept of neo-endogenous rural development critiqued both the\u000d\u000a      dominant model of `top-down', exogenous development (exemplified by the EU\u000d\u000a      Common Agricultural Policy) and transformed the model of `bottom-up',\u000d\u000a      endogenous development, based on local, participative approaches. It\u000d\u000a      proposed instead a `networked' model of development, acknowledging that\u000d\u000a      both local and extra-local factors are critical to processes of rural\u000d\u000a      development and it developed and populated a new conceptual framework that\u000d\u000a      has informed far-reaching analytical and normative responses. This\u000d\u000a      framework stressed the role of human and social capital and the dynamics\u000d\u000a      by which it accumulates in individuals, businesses and organisations.\u000d\u000a      Shucksmith (4) pointed out the affinities of this model with\u000d\u000a      Healey's (Professor, Emeritus Professor) collaborative planning approach (6),\u000d\u000a      and specifically with the concept of institutional capacity, and he\u000d\u000a      proposed concepts of `networked development' and `disintegrated rural\u000d\u000a      development' which brought together these two literatures and schools of\u000d\u000a      thought. The result was an emphasis on: mobilising local actors and\u000d\u000a      communities in place-shaping; a focusing of attention on the\u000d\u000a      `mobilisation' process, in particular, on the role of the state as an\u000d\u000a      enabler of locally controlled development; and, in addressing issues of\u000d\u000a      inequality and capacity. There is a risk with bottom-up development that\u000d\u000a      it exacerbates inequality because there is an unequal capacity to act\u000d\u000a      between local place-based communities, and because, within communities,\u000d\u000a      powerful elites can capture most of the benefit. For Shucksmith, there is\u000d\u000a      a crucial role for the state in engaging in capacity building so that\u000d\u000a      local actors are enabled to influence both local and extra-local domains (4).\u000d\u000a    In summary, the networked (neo-endogenous) approach to rural development\u000d\u000a      involves:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the mobilisation of assets (tangible and intangible, human and\u000d\u000a        non-human), both within and outwith the locality;\u000d\u000a      the building of capacity to act, both amongst individuals but\u000d\u000a        especially collectively in terms of the capacity of people within an\u000d\u000a        area to work together towards a shared vision of their future;\u000d\u000a      networks which connect people within and beyond the locality; and\u000d\u000a      an enabling state, with appropriate cross-sectoral and partnership\u000d\u000a        working at all levels with a culture of institutional learning at its\u000d\u000a        heart.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    It is important to note that this body of research develops both a\u000d\u000a      conceptual framework and a normative agenda: it not only analyses what is\u000d\u000a      underway in some rural places, but also promotes it as a means of `doing'\u000d\u000a      rural development in other areas. Recently, Shucksmith has been the main\u000d\u000a      academic advocate of Newcastle's networked development approach, bringing\u000d\u000a      the arguments to a wider, non-academic audience, most recently through the\u000d\u000a      Carnegie UK Trust's publication of his report, Future Directions in Rural\u000d\u000a      Development (October 2012) and lectures such as his 2008 Macaulay Lecture\u000d\u000a      (Available in audio online at http:\/\/www.macaulay.ac.uk\/MacaulayLecture\/2008\/)\u000d\u000a      and his 2013 address at the House of Lords. The invitation to Chair the\u000d\u000a      Inquiry into Crofting hence provided him with the opportunity to put into\u000d\u000a      practice what he was advocating in terms of the networked development\u000d\u000a      approach.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21453","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The `value-added' of Lowe and Phillipson to the overall social and\u000d\u000a      economic impact of the Relu\u000d\u000a      programme was highlighted by the Independent Evaluation of the programme's\u000d\u000a      impacts\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Research Councils. Of note here is that it sees\u000d\u000a      \"influence in the research and\u000d\u000a      science policy arenas, particularly in growth of acceptance of\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinarity in policy relevant\u000d\u000a      research and in a shift from a model of \"Knowledge Transfer\" to two-way\u000d\u000a      \"Knowledge Exchange\"\u000d\u000a      as a significant legacy from the programme, along with \"Evidence of a set\u000d\u000a      of approaches that can\u000d\u000a      deliver research impacts\". It stresses how the Directorate experimented\u000d\u000a      \"in ways to foster\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Exchange and related impact-generation\" (p.6) (IMP1).\u000d\u000a    The innovations in knowledge exchange and interdisciplinary research\u000d\u000a      practice that were\u000d\u000a      developed and tested as `pathways to impact' by the Relu Director's office\u000d\u000a      had a significant effect\u000d\u000a      on many organisations involved in addressing rural land use problems. The\u000d\u000a      Relu national\u000d\u000a      stakeholder forums acted as sounding boards on programme and project\u000d\u000a      development and\u000d\u000a      dissemination strategies. For Wessex Water, a project forum \"helped\u000d\u000a      crystallise our thinking on\u000d\u000a      how we approached catchment management\" (IMP2); for the former\u000d\u000a      technical director at Marks\u000d\u000a      and Spencer it \"influenced procurement strategies\" (IMP2). The\u000d\u000a      Assynt Foundation, following\u000d\u000a      involvement in a Relu Visiting Fellowship, said that it \"helped to\u000d\u000a      encourage me to tackle some of\u000d\u000a      our practical problems in a more logical and perhaps scientific manner\" (IMP2).\u000d\u000a      Relu's use of\u000d\u000a      digital technology enabled widespread interaction with stakeholders and\u000d\u000a      the public. For example,\u000d\u000a      Relu's Great Land Use Debate attracted around 100 comments and 4500 hits,\u000d\u000a      and helped to set\u000d\u000a      the agenda for the Government's Land Use Futures Project (IMP2).\u000d\u000a    As their research and experimentation progressed, Lowe and Phillipson\u000d\u000a      were very active in\u000d\u000a      transferring their insights into wider science policy with subsequent\u000d\u000a      downstream impacts on later\u000d\u000a      research and its impacts. Numerous high-level presentations and briefings\u000d\u000a      led to changes in UK\u000d\u000a      science policy and practice, including to the Government Chief Scientist,\u000d\u000a      a meeting of all of the UK\u000d\u000a      Chief Scientists, House of Lords, the G8 Research Assessment Group, Food\u000d\u000a      Standards Agency,\u000d\u000a      Natural England, the Food and Environment Research Agency and major\u000d\u000a      research partnerships\u000d\u000a      such as the Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) and Global Food\u000d\u000a      Security (GFS)\u000d\u000a      Programmes. A significant briefing of the research councils in May 2012\u000d\u000a      led to Lowe, Phillipson\u000d\u000a      and Liddon (Relu Science Communication Manager from 2006) being invited to\u000d\u000a      work with the Chief\u000d\u000a      Executives of ESRC, BBSRC and NERC to change their ways of working in the\u000d\u000a      light of findings\u000d\u000a      from Relu.\u000d\u000a    Approaches and tools developed by Lowe, Phillipson and Liddon as part of\u000d\u000a      the Relu experiment\u000d\u000a      have been used within ESRC and NERC knowledge exchange and impact best\u000d\u000a      practice guides\u000d\u000a      (IMP3, IMP4) and within many national Research Council research\u000d\u000a      programmes to enhance\u000d\u000a      practical impacts.

By linking together engagement and the impact parts\u000d\u000a      of the SIAM dataset it\u000d\u000a      is possible to investigate what encourages successful knowledge exchange\u000d\u000a      and what kinds of\u000d\u000a      stakeholder relationships are associated with what kinds of impact.\u000d\u000a      Phillipson has held briefings\u000d\u000a      with Knowledge Exchange officials in the research councils on its wider\u000d\u000a      application and it is now\u000d\u000a      used to inform new research programmes.

This recognition is accompanied by calls for the\u000d\u000a      `democratisation' of science such that it\u000d\u000a      is more transparent and responsive to public concerns. In addition a\u000d\u000a      series of `rural' crises\u000d\u000a      demanded new approaches to make research better oriented to the problems.\u000d\u000a      An example was the\u000d\u000a      management of the 2001 outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the UK\u000d\u000a      which was\u000d\u000a      investigated by Newcastle University's Centre for Rural Economy.

Requiring strategic\u000d\u000a      collaboration across\u000d\u000a      three research councils (ESRC, BBSRC, NERC) with 94 projects involving\u000d\u000a      over 450 social and\u000d\u000a      natural scientists and more than 4000 stakeholders from the public,\u000d\u000a      private and third sectors, it\u000d\u000a      provided an ideal test bed for interdisciplinary collaboration between\u000d\u000a      natural and social scientists,\u000d\u000a      and for devising methods for effective stakeholder engagement, policy\u000d\u000a      exchange, and practice\u000d\u000a      involvement in interdisciplinary research.

Little was known about how older people cope in unfamiliar\u000d\u000aenvironments. Key findings included the recognition that environmental unfamiliarity arises when\u000d\u000afamiliar places become unfamiliar not only because of cognitive decline but also through urban\u000d\u000aregeneration, and when older people travel to new places, regardless of the purpose of travel. The\u000d\u000aresearch identified positive and negative environmental `triggers' that affect older people's\u000d\u000aexperience of unfamiliar spaces, allowing interventions to mitigate the effects of negative triggers\u000d\u000aand augment the positive triggers.\u000d\u000aQuantitative and qualitative research methods assessed older people's experiences of unfamiliar\u000d\u000aenvironments with adapted quantitative measures of older people's reactions to urban design\u000d\u000aquality and walkability. Using samples living in the Swansea area, unfamiliar with Colchester in\u000d\u000anorth-east Essex (and vice-versa), the study trialled `visitors' to each location.

The research shows the relevance of\u000d\u000ashared memories of events and situations to particular places and buildings.\u000d\u000aSigns are of limited use in unfamiliar and new areas. They are often positioned incorrectly (too\u000d\u000ahigh, for example), and lack essential content such as indications of distance or walking time to\u000d\u000athe destination.\u000d\u000aGaps exist in planning practitioners' understanding of the inter-related elements of older\u000d\u000apeople's relationships with the built environment.

These include low noise domestic\u000d\u000a      ventilation systems manufactured by Greenwood and Titon; acoustic\u000d\u000a      green-roof systems developed by Kingspan; and road noise barriers\u000d\u000a      manufactured by Acoustic Modules Ltd. In particular, since 2011 a novel\u000d\u000a      acoustic window system, designed by Professor Kang, has made significant\u000d\u000a      contributions to overall built environment sustainability in six major\u000d\u000a      projects led by the Hong Kong Housing Department [S5]. The system reduces\u000d\u000a      external noise while allowing effective day-lighting and natural\u000d\u000a      ventilation, with a typical saving of &#163;60k per year per building over the\u000d\u000a      use of standard air- conditioning systems.\u000d\u000a    Organised networks and workshops that have helped define the\u000d\u000a          regulatory agenda\u000d\u000a    Based on his research in sound propagation, soundscape, and green\u000d\u000a      acoustic components, Professor Kang has set up and chaired three\u000d\u000a      professional networks to propagate research and best practice and inform\u000d\u000a      the development of relevant regulations:\u000d\u000a    1) European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [S6] Network on\u000d\u000a      Soundscape of European Cities and Landscapes (2009-2013, &#8364;500k), which\u000d\u000a      created an international network of 83 participating organisations from 22\u000d\u000a      COST countries and 7 partner organisations outside Europe;\u000d\u000a    2) EPSRC Noise-Futures network [S6] (2006-2009, &#163;100k, Professor Kang is\u000d\u000a      joint Chair), with 52 participating organisations including policy makers,\u000d\u000a      consultants and researchers;\u000d\u000a    3) Worldwide University Network on Environmental Acoustics (2004- ) with\u000d\u000a      major world-leading acoustic centres.\u000d\u000a    32 workshops have been hosted by these networks across the EU, attended\u000d\u000a      by over 2000 people, to discuss and define environmental acoustic practice\u000d\u000a      and policy. Sonic installations following COST workshops in Brighton, in\u000d\u000a      2011, demonstrated a ground breaking soundscape implementation that\u000d\u000a      enhances public safety and improves crowd behaviour [S7]. The workshop\u000d\u000a      outputs also formed the foundation of the first ISO Standard for\u000d\u000a      soundscapes: ISO\/TC 43\/SC 1\/WG 54: Perceptual Assessment of Soundscape\u000d\u000a      Quality &#8212; a key standard for designers, planners and policy makers. Part 1\u000d\u000a      of this standard was published in 2012 [S8].\u000d\u000a    Influenced development and adoption of international policies on\u000d\u000a          environmental noise\u000d\u000a    A major impact of Professor Kang's research is that urban planning now\u000d\u000a      takes better account of environmental noise. Professor Kang's soundscape\u000d\u000a      research has been delivered to policy makers through invited keynote\u000d\u000a      lectures at international and national conferences and workshops organised\u000d\u000a      by local authorities and government policy-making organisations. In 2009\u000d\u000a      Professor Kang delivered a keynote speech to 150 practitioners and\u000d\u000a      policymakers at the Tranquil Spaces conference, organised by the\u000d\u000a      Greater London Authority [S9]. Ten similar presentations have been\u000d\u000a      delivered since 2008 in London, Brighton, China, India, Malta and Sweden,\u000d\u000a      with a total audience of over 500. As a consequence, Professor Kang's\u000d\u000a      research is now included in the recent DEFRA benchmarking report [S10] on\u000d\u000a      soundscape and creation of quiet areas, following the strict requirements\u000d\u000a      by the EU Directive 2002\/49\/EC.\u000d\u000a    The impact of his research on international policy is evidenced by\u000d\u000a      Professor Kang being appointed as Chief Environmental Acoustics Adviser to\u000d\u000a      the Planning Department of four major Chinese cities, Dalian, Harbin,\u000d\u000a      Huludao, and Taiyuan. In this role he is able to apply his research to\u000d\u000a      guiding planning policy to integrate environmental noise and soundscape\u000d\u000a      issues with a fast urbanisation process. The dissemination of Professor\u000d\u000a      Kang's research and its adoption as part of national and local planning\u000d\u000a      policy has been encouraged by media coverage of his work on urban sound\u000d\u000a      environment, including BBC, Times, Radio New Zealand National, and China\u000d\u000a      Changsha TV.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Theoretical and experimental research on urban sound environments has\u000d\u000a      been carried out by Professor Kang and his team at the University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield since 1999.

Since he joined the University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield in 1999, Professor Jian Kang has developed sound propagation\u000d\u000a      theories, pioneered soundscape approaches, and established a theoretical\u000d\u000a      basis for a range of green acoustic products.\u000d\u000a    Professor Kang leads a research group of 15-20 associates, PhD\u000d\u000a      researchers and visiting researchers from 8 countries including France,\u000d\u000a      Germany, Italy, Sweden, China, Korea, Brazil and Australia. Since 1999, 32\u000d\u000a      of his projects have received total funding of over &#163;4m, from European\u000d\u000a      Commission, EPSRC, AHRC, Royal Society, British Academy, British Council,\u000d\u000a      China Natural Science Foundation, and from industry including BP, Samsung\u000d\u000a      and Kingspan. The research has generated 428 publications, including 86\u000d\u000a      journal publications, 3 monograph books, 36 keynote speeches, and 5 design\u000d\u000a      guides\/tools now adopted as standard references by planning and design\u000d\u000a      practitioners.\u000d\u000a    Professor Kang's research since 1999 at Sheffield can be divided in to\u000d\u000a      three main areas:\u000d\u000a    Sound propagation\u000d\u000a    Professor Kang has been researching fundamental acoustic theories and\u000d\u000a      models for urban sound propagation. Through theoretical analytic work,\u000d\u000a      developing algorithms and codes for computer simulation, physical scale\u000d\u000a      modelling and in-situ measurements, Professor Kang's research discovered a\u000d\u000a      series of fundamental phenomena in long spaces, such as the variation of\u000d\u000a      reverberation along their length and the non-linearity of the decay\u000d\u000a      process. From these results he developed formulae to calculate\u000d\u000a      reverberation in long spaces, as well as the radiosity model to simulate\u000d\u000a      sound fields formed by diffuse boundaries. With its high accuracy, of 2dB,\u000d\u000a      the radiosity model provided the basis for micro-scale urban area sound\u000d\u000a      map computation [R1], and this has been integrated into practical\u000d\u000a      noise-mapping techniques. His research at Sheffield on the acoustics of\u000d\u000a      long spaces, including underground stations and urban streets, was\u000d\u000a      published in a monograph book [R2].\u000d\u000a    Soundscape\u000d\u000a    Professor Kang pioneered soundscape research at Sheffield that examines a\u000d\u000a      constructive and holistic approach to noise control in the built\u000d\u000a      environment, closely related to the EU policy on identifying and\u000d\u000a      protecting quiet areas. Rather than focusing on noise reduction alone,\u000d\u000a      this considers environmental acoustics in a broader context that includes\u000d\u000a      perspectives from psychology, sociology, anthropology and medicine.\u000d\u000a      Together with his team, Professor Kang used analyses of sound fields in\u000d\u000a      urban spaces and subjective evaluation of soundscapes, to generate the\u000d\u000a      world's largest soundscape database [R3]. This revealed direct\u000d\u000a      relationships between the subjective evaluation of acoustic comfort and\u000d\u000a      objective measures of sound fields within the urban context. The database\u000d\u000a      has also been used to develop prediction models, based on neural network\u000d\u000a      techniques, from which soundscape quality maps can be generated. This has\u000d\u000a      led to the development of a set of design tools for planners and\u000d\u000a      architects [R4] and the publication of a soundscape design framework [R5].\u000d\u000a    Green acoustics\u000d\u000a    This research area focuses on reducing noise in a sustainable manner.\u000d\u000a      Since 1999 Professor Kang has established basic acoustic theories for a\u000d\u000a      number of green building elements, including natural ventilation window\u000d\u000a      systems [R6], low-noise ventilators, low-height noise barriers, green\u000d\u000a      roofs and non-fibrous micro-perforated membrane sound absorbers.\u000d\u000a      Correspondingly, a series of field and laboratory experimental studies\u000d\u000a      were carried out, to validate the theories.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22929","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The evolution of planning obligations policies in the UK since 2008 has\u000d\u000a      been shaped by the research undertaken at Sheffield on the incidence of\u000d\u000a      obligations, their value and the way they have been delivered. The\u000d\u000a      research team developed a strategy to maximise the impact of their\u000d\u000a      findings that was based on three sets of complementary activities:\u000d\u000a    (i) Co-production of the research agenda and research design: a\u000d\u000a      range of stakeholders (including policy makers and researchers within\u000d\u000a      DCLG, Welsh Assembly Government, Countryside Agency, Housing and\u000d\u000a      Communities Agency (then Housing Corporation), the National Housing\u000d\u000a      Federation, Halcrow Consultants and local planning and housing\u000d\u000a      practitioners) were involved at various stages in establishing\u000d\u000a      policy-relevant research questions, co-designing research methods, and\u000d\u000a      analysing and interpreting results in partnership with our team. These\u000d\u000a      stakeholders played different roles in different projects. They acted\u000d\u000a      variously as commissioners of research, members of the research teams,\u000d\u000a      research subjects and steering\/advisory group members; and assisted in\u000d\u000a      distilling the key messages from the research. This ensured that the\u000d\u000a      research was robust, relevant to the challenges faced by policy makers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners, and that the findings were accessible to different user\u000d\u000a      groups.\u000d\u000a    (ii) Dissemination of Best Practice: the team has engaged in an\u000d\u000a      extensive UK-wide programme of dissemination of findings to\u000d\u000a      housing\/property, legal and planning practitioners involved in policy\u000d\u000a      implementation. This includes the publication of articles in the\u000d\u000a      professional press (e.g. Planning), Continuing Professional\u000d\u000a      Development activities and contributions to around 20 best practice\u000d\u000a      briefings. The events programme included numerous national symposia\u000d\u000a      reaching around 400 members of the planning profession (e.g. the RTPI\u000d\u000a      Planning Convention (2009), the RTPI S106 and CIL Seminars (2008x2, 2009,\u000d\u000a      2010; 2011 and 2012 [latter two chaired by Crook]); a series of local\u000d\u000a      events including workshops on the value and incidence of obligations in\u000d\u000a      London, Leeds and Bristol attended by representatives of 57 different\u000d\u000a      local planning authorities; and presentations to around 100 property\u000d\u000a      industry leaders at the British Property Federation Seminar (2010), to\u000d\u000a      House- builders' Heads of Legal Forum hosted by lawyers Nabarro LLP (2010)\u000d\u000a      and to the planning partners and their teams at lawyers DLA Piper LLP\u000d\u000a      (2008, 2010).\u000d\u000a    (iii) National Policy Engagement: ongoing engagement with\u000d\u000a      national policy makers involved in new policy formation, including invited\u000d\u000a      seminars at the Treasury, Welsh Assembly Government, and DCLG (2009);\u000d\u000a      presentations to meetings of the UK and Irish Chief Planners; and the\u000d\u000a      provision of evidence to Select Committees (for example S1).\u000d\u000a    The cumulative effect of this extensive approach to user engagement with\u000d\u000a      the planning obligations research programme can be seen most clearly\u000d\u000a      through three important, demonstrable impacts.\u000d\u000a    (i) The research has been influential in informing government\u000d\u000a        thinking about policy reform on the role of planning obligations and\u000d\u000a      its relationship to other forms of funding of affordable housing. Our\u000d\u000a      evidence on the way in which state subsidies from the Homes and\u000d\u000a      Communities Agency were used (with little impact on the level of\u000d\u000a      provision) contributed to the restructuring of grants for affordable\u000d\u000a      housing on sites subject to planning obligations (now formalised in the\u000d\u000a      Homes &amp; Communities Agency's National Affordable Housing Programme for\u000d\u000a      the years 2012 to 2016) and thus to a more efficient use of &#163;2.8bn per\u000d\u000a      annum of public expenditure on affordable homes (S2).\u000d\u000a    (ii) Our evidence on the value of obligations has had a direct impact\u000d\u000a        on the development of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\u000d\u000a      influencing the reach of the levy and leading to a larger proportion of\u000d\u000a      sites contributing to infrastructure funding and provision. This influence\u000d\u000a      can be tracked from the Barker Review of Land Use Planning (S3)\u000d\u000a      through debates about the nature and shape of post-Barker Reforms\u000d\u000a      including the subsequently abandoned Planning Gain Supplement proposal and\u000d\u000a      its successor, the CIL (S4). Our work was a central\u000d\u000a      component of the evidence base for the development of CIL, being the only\u000d\u000a      research quoted in the series of DCLG consultations on the policy and\u000d\u000a      regulations (e.g. DCLG, `CIL', August 2008, p13) (S5). Our work on\u000d\u000a      `Common starting points for S106 negotiations' indicated that proposals\u000d\u000a      for statutory guidance on negotiations would prove to be ineffective. This\u000d\u000a      proposal was dropped. Furthermore, our estimates of obligations' value and\u000d\u000a      incidence also had a prominent role in the official regulatory impact\u000d\u000a      assessments (DCLG `CIL Impact Assessment', p 8 &amp; 16) because they shed\u000d\u000a      light on how the previous framework has been operating, and specifically\u000d\u000a      evidenced the limited incidence of obligations and supplied unique\u000d\u000a      estimates of the additional revenue to be raised via the Levy (S6).\u000d\u000a    (iii) the findings influenced local authority and private sector\u000d\u000a        (including legal) policy and practice by showing how specific\u000d\u000a      approaches to negotiations and to monitoring were strongly related to the\u000d\u000a      number and value of obligations secured. Our first study of the Value of\u000d\u000a      Obligations for ODPM provided the basis for the Planning Obligations:\u000d\u000a      Practice Guide (DCLG, 2006) and our updates (supported by the\u000d\u000a      dissemination and CPD certificated contributions outlined above) have\u000d\u000a      continued to be influential throughout this REF period with, for example,\u000d\u000a      the 2010 study (R1 above) used extensively in the impact assessment\u000d\u000a      concerned with renegotiating S106 Planning Obligations (S7) which\u000d\u000a      has sought to steer local practice in response to the market downturn.\u000d\u000a      More generally, our research has been credited by many, including the\u000d\u000a      former Director of Policy at the RTPI, with providing a rationale for\u000d\u000a      greater formalisation of policy, better preparation for - and structuring\u000d\u000a      of - negotiations, and much improved monitoring of policy delivery (S8).\u000d\u000a      These changes in practice have been associated with improved levels of\u000d\u000a      value capture.\u000d\u000a    In sum, the programme of research led by The University of Sheffield on\u000d\u000a      planning obligations has influenced the design and development of policies\u000d\u000a      in ways that have helped to secure additional homes for low-income\u000d\u000a      households and to ensure that public infrastructure provision is better\u000d\u000a      resourced at local and national levels. The research team has influenced\u000d\u000a      the behaviour of practitioners and contributed to improvements in the way\u000d\u000a      in which planning obligations policies have been implemented by local\u000d\u000a      government. As the former specialist adviser to House of Commons Select\u000d\u000a      Committee on Communities and Local Government has commented \"[this\u000d\u000a        research] has added considerably to the capacity of local authorities to\u000d\u000a        deliver affordable homes and infrastructure for new development\" (S8).\u000d\u000a      This has led to improvements in access to housing, the provision of public\u000d\u000a      goods and physical neighbourhood quality in a great many local communities\u000d\u000a      throughout the UK.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Planning obligations are used by local government to capture some of the\u000d\u000a      financial windfall that accrues to land owners and developers when\u000d\u000a      planning permissions are granted. University of Sheffield research into\u000d\u000a      the incidence of planning obligations, their financial value, and\u000d\u000a      variations in related local policy and practice has made a significant\u000d\u000a      contribution to national policy development. This includes the shaping of\u000d\u000a      the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the improvement of obligations\u000d\u000a      policy implementation throughout the UK. The three main impacts of the\u000d\u000a      research have been: (i) to provide evidence that has resulted in a much\u000d\u000a      larger proportion of sites now contributing to infrastructure provision\u000d\u000a      than was initially intended in national policy; (ii) to provide evidence\u000d\u000a      that influenced the decision to restructure affordable housing grants,\u000d\u000a      resulting in better use of around &#163;2.8bn per annum of public expenditure\u000d\u000a      and a greater supply of new housing for lower income households than would\u000d\u000a      otherwise have been possible; and (iii) to inform best practice within\u000d\u000a      local authorities, enabling many of them to use obligations to capture\u000d\u000a      increasingly large contributions to infrastructure provision.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Sheffield\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sheffield (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sheffield","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007157}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aR1.

The income derived from\u000d\u000a      obligations is used to secure the delivery of new affordable homes and the\u000d\u000a      infrastructure required for new development, including schools and public\u000d\u000a      transport.\u000d\u000a    The use and design of planning obligations policies have been a\u000d\u000a      longstanding source of controversy and their scope, effectiveness and\u000d\u000a      impact on the operation of markets has been both under-researched and\u000d\u000a      poorly understood by policy-makers and practitioners. Staff at The\u000d\u000a      University of Sheffield (Professor Tony Crook [Emeritus since 2010],\u000d\u000a      Professor John Henneberry, and Professor Craig Watkins, with input from\u000d\u000a      Professor Heather Campbell, Dr Ed Ferrari, Dr Steven Rowley [Curtin since\u000d\u000a      2007], and Dr Malcolm Tait) have conducted a series of 12 externally\u000d\u000a      funded projects on the incidence, value and delivery of planning\u000d\u000a      obligations that have been highly significant in shaping planning\u000d\u000a      obligations policy nationally and in influencing the way in which policy\u000d\u000a      is implemented at the local level. Currently, we estimate that Planning\u000d\u000a      Obligations worth more &#163;6bn per annum are agreed in England and Wales (R1).\u000d\u000a    This research commenced at Sheffield in 1993 and has, at times, involved\u000d\u000a      working with colleagues at Cambridge University and with planning\u000d\u000a      consultants Halcrow. Our research has extensively influenced the scope and\u000d\u000a      scale of the uniquely structured planning gain policy arrangements\u000d\u000a      operating in England and Wales.\u000d\u000a    Our initial research, undertaken by Henneberry for the Department of\u000d\u000a      Environment, explored the implications of the introduction of a\u000d\u000a      development impact fee system, including the likely effects on\u000d\u000a      practitioner behaviour. (Note: the current Community Infrastructure Levy\u000d\u000a      is technically a form of Impact Fee). These findings informed an\u000d\u000a      examination of how planning obligations mediate the relations between\u000d\u000a      planners and developers and highlighted the profound influence that the\u000d\u000a      increased use of obligations was having on policy and practice (funded by\u000d\u000a      Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Land Development Trust and\u000d\u000a      the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) &#163;32k,\u000d\u000a      1998-2000). This work led to high quality academic outputs (R2) and\u000d\u000a      helped shape the future research agenda.\u000d\u000a    The conceptual and practical insights provided a platform for detailed\u000d\u000a      studies of the use of obligations (known as section 106 agreements) and\u000d\u000a      related grant policy arrangements as a means of securing new affordable\u000d\u000a      housing. This work, which spanned 6 funded projects (all conducted with\u000d\u000a      Cambridge who led mainly on delivery issues, and shared the case study\u000d\u000a      work geographically), provided the basis from which to disentangle the\u000d\u000a      influence of agreements from other funding mechanisms and to explore the\u000d\u000a      efficiency and equity of the policy regime in its entirety. The research\u000d\u000a      outputs included contributions to conceptual debates about the\u000d\u000a      distributional effects of the policy arrangement (R3) and numerous\u000d\u000a      reports and briefings detailing specific findings, targeted at policy\u000d\u000a      makers and practitioners.\u000d\u000a    The key contributions include: (i) the first estimates of the additional\u000d\u000a      affordable housing secured through planning gain (2000, &#163;181k funded by\u000d\u000a      Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), Housing Corporation, Countryside Agency,\u000d\u000a      Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and the Royal Town\u000d\u000a      Planning Institute (RTPI)); (ii) a detailed exploration of the extent to\u000d\u000a      which new homes were funded through planning gain and\/or grants (2003,\u000d\u000a      &#163;42k JRF); (iii) an assessment of the value for money of using planning\u000d\u000a      gain compared with grant (2003, &#163;60k Office of the Deputy Prime Minister\u000d\u000a      (ODPM)); (iv) analysis of the extent to which agreements for new homes\u000d\u000a      were delivered (2005, &#163;36k JRF); (v) an exploration of how negotiations\u000d\u000a      could maximise the funds secured by planning gain (2007, &#163;48k DCLG); and\u000d\u000a      (vi) an assessment of how CIL levies might reduce sums negotiated for\u000d\u000a      affordable homes through planning gain (2011, &#163;10k National Housing\u000d\u000a      Federation (NHF)).

Crucially, as we discuss in section 4, when examined in\u000d\u000a      the round the findings of this research called into question the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of affordable housing grants.\u000d\u000a    This complemented a further series of Sheffield-led studies that, like\u000d\u000a      the early impact fees studies, re-focused on the wider role of obligations\u000d\u000a      and related policy instruments as mechanisms to secure not just affordable\u000d\u000a      homes but also the infrastructure needed for all types of new development.\u000d\u000a      These projects were designed to provide an input into the design of CIL\u000d\u000a      and established a robust method for measuring the value of obligations in\u000d\u000a      England (see above; and 2005, with Halcrow, &#163;93k for ODPM; 2007, &#163;51k\u000d\u000a      DCLG; &amp; 2007\/08, with Cambridge, &#163;123k DCLG) and Wales (R6,\u000d\u000a      2007\/08, &#163;35k, Welsh Assembly Government). The research also provided\u000d\u000a      unique insights into local experience and demonstrated that, contrary to\u000d\u000a      the popular views held by policy and professional communities, variations\u000d\u000a      in the value and number of obligations secured more often arose from\u000d\u000a      differences in local practice than from more commonly cited drivers such\u000d\u000a      market conditions, with land and property values tending to be of\u000d\u000a      secondary importance. This evidence has had important implications for\u000d\u000a      local policy-makers and practitioners and the way in which policy has been\u000d\u000a      implemented.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23009","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Process\u000d\u000a    The research has been undertaken with a philosophy that embraces a need\u000d\u000a      to involve a wide constituency within the work.

Our work\u000d\u000a      with Robert Gordon's College allowed pupils and staff to engage in a\u000d\u000a      participatory design process, which had practical (design of a\u000d\u000a      green campus) and educational (engagement with University staff\u000d\u000a      and students) benefits.

This process has led to the\u000d\u000a      development of an innovative series of outputs, including those for both\u000d\u000a      academic (conference) and industrial (films, fact sheets, public events)\u000d\u000a      audiences. Recently, our work with Robert Gordon's College (a private\u000d\u000a      school, without affiliation to RGU) during 2012-13 involved all pupils\u000d\u000a      from the ages of 5-18 in a participatory design exercise. Apart from the\u000d\u000a      immediate benefits to be derived from design outputs themselves, there are\u000d\u000a      clear benefits to the participants in that they were enabled to\u000d\u000a      participate in a large scale design process. Corresponding benefits to RGU\u000d\u000a      were clear in that the challenging delivery of a high quality design\u000d\u000a      experience resulted in a deeply satisfying (and award winning) research\u000d\u000a      project.\u000d\u000a    Members of the group have organised and chaired high profile professional\u000d\u000a      and academic conferences (Bennadji, Laing) throughout the\u000d\u000a      submission period (ASCAAD 2010, IV\/BuiltVis 2007-present), and have been\u000d\u000a      active in the delivery of invited lectures across Europe. The group has\u000d\u000a      represented the RICS on the European Construction Technology Platform\u000d\u000a      since 2008 (Laing). Research from the architectural audits has been\u000d\u000a      disseminated through exhibition and conference (Scott 2006-10).\u000d\u000a    Significance: Almost all of the group activity has been undertaken\u000d\u000a      in partnership with colleagues from industry or the public sector, and has\u000d\u000a      had a direct feed into policy and practice (e.g. Greenspace EU and\u000d\u000a        Scottish Government, Streetscapes Scottish Enterprise, Urban\u000d\u000a      Connections Aberdeen City).\u000d\u000a    Work from the group has appeared in leading international academic\u000d\u000a      journals, within which work of significance and key to debate within the\u000d\u000a      discipline is published. The work carries significance in terms of\u000d\u000a      methodological innovation (environmental monitoring, visualisation)\u000d\u000a      and in relation to online user participation (from Streetscapes,\u000d\u000a      onwards).\u000d\u000a    Nature of the impact\u000d\u000a    RGU was a key partner in `CARE North' (Interreg IVB), which aimed to\u000d\u000a      promote the use of sustainable urban transport as a key component within\u000d\u000a      urban design in the North Sea Region.

We have also been engaged with a wider range of\u000d\u000a      North Sea Region projects, including undertaking focussed consultancy work\u000d\u000a      within Build with CARE. Through the completion of this research, a series\u000d\u000a      of applied methodologies have been developed which assist and facilitate a\u000d\u000a      process of user engagement in design, and visualisation within\u000d\u000a      architecture (Mahdjoubi et al 2013).\u000d\u000a    The earliest work referenced in this case study was jointly instigated by\u000d\u000a      RGU and Scottish Enterprise (1999-2001), and concerned the use of combined\u000d\u000a      visualisation and environmental economics in the consideration of\u000d\u000a      streetscape redevelopment. The Streetscapes project aimed to develop a\u000d\u000a      method whereby public participation in the design of streetscapes could be\u000d\u000a      realised in an interactive and ultimately positive manner. This was\u000d\u000a      achieved through the application of non-market valuation techniques (i.e.\u000d\u000a      choice experiments) and computer generated images. Streetscapes present a\u000d\u000a      complex and dynamic setting for urban life, and that complexity was\u000d\u000a      reflected in the project methodology. The results from the study indicate\u000d\u000a      that image based choice experiments do generate valid, useful results.\u000d\u000a    It was anticipated that the resulting methods would be of use to\u000d\u000a      planners, designers and developers. The intention was to encourage\u000d\u000a      creativity, stimulate discussion, refine ideas and ultimately produce\u000d\u000a      designs which optimise the needs of all parties involved (Laing et\u000d\u000a      al 2007, Conniff et al 2010).\u000d\u000a    Many European towns and cities possess attractive parks and recreational\u000d\u000a      areas. The Greenspace project (FP7 2001-04) developed methodologies that\u000d\u000a      identified the types and variety of open and green space that best satisfy\u000d\u000a      peoples needs (Laing et al 2006 and 2009). Using case studies, it\u000d\u000a      demonstrated how public participation can be brought into the strategic\u000d\u000a      planning of greenspace on a continuing basis. The research assessed how\u000d\u000a      strategic planning can maximise the contribution that different types of\u000d\u000a      open and greenspace make to quality of life. By combining a planning,\u000d\u000a      ecological and socio-economic assessment, the project categorised the\u000d\u000a      existing provision of greenspace in sample cities. It describes how\u000d\u000a      greenspace is used, and evaluated the extent to which existing greenspace\u000d\u000a      meets social needs. The research also led to the involvement of RGU in the\u000d\u000a      revision of planning policy guidance in Scotland regarding public open\u000d\u000a      space.\u000d\u000a    Work undertaken though CARE North (and currently being extended through\u000d\u000a      CARE North+, 2009-2013, ongoing) engaged with a consortium of six\u000d\u000a      Municipal Authority partners from across the North Sea region, to help\u000d\u000a      design, develop and evaluate approaches to low carbon urban transport.\u000d\u000a    The research group has been actively engaged also in the inclusion of\u000d\u000a      wider groups within urban design, including school children (Zaman and\u000d\u000a      Thaddeus 2013). Research methods and principles central to our work in\u000d\u000a      participatory design were applied within an inclusive study of school\u000d\u000a      re-design, which engaged with children at primary and secondary levels.\u000d\u000a    Researchers associated with outputs (dates employed by RGU):\u000d\u000a      Richard Laing (1997-present), Anna Conniff (2005-10), Tony Craig\u000d\u000a      (2000-07), Carlos Galan Diaz (2009), Anne-Marie Davies (1999-2003),\u000d\u000a      Stephen Scott (2001-08), Quazi Zaman (2008-present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23010","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The design outputs have been cited as best-practice case studies and have\u000a      become benchmark\u000a      for low-energy sustainable designs.

It has been undertaken with a philosophy\u000a      that embraces a need to\u000a      involve a wide constituency within the work. Key findings have had an\u000a      impact on the study of IT\u000a      within the visualization of design detail, environmental performance, and\u000a      the application of\u000a      innovative methods within the design of sustainable housing.\u000a    Key beneficiaries of the research\u000a    Beneficiaries of the practice-based sustainable housing research include\u000a      housing providers and\u000a      policy makers whose strategies have focussed on meeting their low carbon,\u000a      good quality design\u000a      and social inclusion agendas, including the fuel poverty. The design\u000a      outputs were particularly\u000a      selected and awarded by beneficiaries, to reflect their own initiatives\u000a      and aspirations. The design\u000a      outputs incorporated within their design guides, best practice case\u000a      studies, and policy reports for\u000a      the others to inspire and follow. Other key beneficiaries for the design\u000a      outputs have been the public\u000a      and the occupiers of the social housing sector where their running costs\u000a      were being reduced\u000a      considerably to improve their life standards and dealing with the fuel\u000a      poverty.\u000a    \u000a      Housing associations, local Authorities and other social housing\u000a        providers\u000a      Scottish Enterprise\u000a      Affordable House providers\u000a      Owners and tenants\u000a      Construction professionals\u000a    \u000a    Nature of the impact\u000a    The research-based practice outputs of the sustainable housing exemplify\u000a      the real and tangible\u000a      ways in which our research also impacts on society and the environment\u000a      outside of academia. The\u000a      high quality architectural responses have resulted in design outputs which\u000a      set a high benchmark\u000a      for future affordable housing.

Professor Deveci was one of the active participants\u000a      representing the UK for\u000a      the IEH SHC task 28.\u000a    There are many barriers for the adoption of Low carbon construction\u000a      standards within the house\u000a      building industry which includes the capital cost, skill shortages, supply\u000a      chain and changing\u000a      behaviours. The proposal focuses on the reluctance of the volume house\u000a      builder. It would appear\u000a      that this is a consequence of incomplete knowledge, and a beliefs that `it\u000a      is too much change and\u000a      that the additional capital costs involved cannot easily be passed on to\u000a      purchasers as the value\u000a      accrued is poorly understood and communicated.

The Landscape Character Database, which\u000d\u000a      retains a record of all LCAs carried out until 11 Nov 2010, shows that\u000d\u000a      from 2008 until the database was closed due to lack of continuation\u000d\u000a      funding, the majority of LCAs referenced the guidance as their key source.\u000d\u000a      (S1)\u000d\u000a    The Topic Paper on sensitivity and capacity has had an equally\u000d\u000a      significant impact and has led to a considerable number of studies by\u000d\u000a      various tiers of local government to assess the sensitivity and capacity\u000d\u000a      of their landscapes to different forms of development. The proliferation\u000d\u000a      of wind energy developments has meant that there has been widespread use\u000d\u000a      of the approach to produce sensitivity and capacity studies for wind farm\u000d\u000a      developments in different parts of the country and there has also been\u000d\u000a      emphasis on their use in relation to housing.\u000d\u000a    The research has had an impact on practice in Europe and in particular\u000d\u000a      has helped to shape the approach set out in the European Landscape\u000d\u000a      Convention (ELC). It has been described by Tveit (S9) as internationally\u000d\u000a      one of \"three of the most widely applied practical frameworks for\u000d\u000a      analysing visual qualities.\" The EU funded research project on a European\u000d\u000a      Landscape Character Assessment Initiative (ELCAI) acknowledges the\u000d\u000a      influence of this work on practitioners in its final report (S6, S10).\u000d\u000a    Two 2009 articles, one in Landscape and Urban Planning (S3) and\u000d\u000a      one in Land Use Policy (S4), a journal aimed at practitioners and\u000d\u000a      policy makers as well as academics, mention the influence of the approach\u000d\u000a      in developing a parallel approach in Belgium. The Danish guidance on\u000d\u000a      landscape character assessment emerged directly in response to the\u000d\u000a      influence of the UK guidance (S2).\u000d\u000a    In 2012 the LCA work had an impact on policy development in the\u000d\u000a      International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Heritage\u000d\u000a      Programme through a study intended to improve guidance for the application\u000d\u000a      and assessment of criterion (vii), one of the ten criteria used by the\u000d\u000a      World Heritage Committee to identify land as having Outstanding Universal\u000d\u000a      Value sufficient to merit World Heritage status. The study report (S9)\u000d\u000a      makes extensive reference to the LCA method and the UK guidance and\u000d\u000a      devotes a separate annex to explaining the approach, concluding that\u000d\u000a      several aspects of LCA are particularly relevant to the application of\u000d\u000a      criterion (vii). It notes, for example, that \"LCA offers guidance on\u000d\u000a        techniques and vocabulary that can be adapted to different environments\u000d\u000a        and provides a level of consistency across similar types of areas that\u000d\u000a        may be assessed by different individuals. A similar type of guidance\u000d\u000a        could be developed for assessment of aesthetic values under criterion\u000d\u000a        (vii)\".

The introduction by the UK Government, initially in\u000d\u000a      Planning Policy Guidance Note 7 of 1997, of a policy aimed at protecting\u000d\u000a      rural landscape `for its own sake' gave impetus to a search for a method\u000d\u000a      that could be used by local authorities to implement this approach in\u000d\u000a      their strategic planning.\u000d\u000a    From 1998 to 2002, Swanwick was funded by the Countryside Agency and\u000d\u000a      Scottish Natural Heritage to look at how landscape can be taken into\u000d\u000a      account in decision making in ways that move beyond the traditional\u000d\u000a      approach of designating protected landscapes to methods that recognise the\u000d\u000a      distinctive character of all landscapes. This required 1) recognition of\u000d\u000a      the need to move beyond the idea of landscape value as the basis for\u000d\u000a      decision making; and 2) development of an acceptable, reliable and\u000d\u000a      repeatable method of assessing the character of the wider landscape and\u000d\u000a      using this information to inform decision making. The research brought\u000d\u000a      together theoretical perspectives with lessons from Swanwick's previous\u000d\u000a      practice experience, and was informed by extensive user consultations and\u000d\u000a      examination of case studies. The research and associated outputs\u000d\u000a      crystallised the concept of landscape as the relationship between people\u000d\u000a      and place and challenged the idea that it is too complex and subjective a\u000d\u000a      concept to be able to influence policy and practice. The researchers\u000d\u000a      developed an accessible and workable practical method known as Landscape\u000d\u000a      Character Assessment (LCA) &#8212; a process of identifying and describing\u000d\u000a      variation in the character of the landscape and using this information to\u000d\u000a      assist in managing change. The key output was definitive published\u000d\u000a      guidance on LCA (R1), written by Swanwick, initially to be used in England\u000d\u000a      and Scotland to reflect the remits of the funders. This set out in detail\u000d\u000a      the method to be adopted in assessing the character of the landscape at\u000d\u000a      different scales and using the results (the characterisation) to inform\u000d\u000a      judgements in many different areas of landscape policy. It was illustrated\u000d\u000a      by a number of case studies and examples of the approach in practice.\u000d\u000a    Between 2002 and 2003, Swanwick carried out further research, funded by\u000d\u000a      the same agencies, focussing on the complex issue of how Landscape\u000d\u000a      Character Assessment could be used to underpin judgements about the\u000d\u000a      sensitivity of different landscapes to change and development and their\u000d\u000a      capacity to accommodate change. This research involved consultation with a\u000d\u000a      reference group of practitioners and examination of practical examples of\u000d\u000a      alternative approaches to identify an acceptable approach. The output was\u000d\u000a      a topic paper (R3) on sensitivity and capacity, published as an addendum\u000d\u000a      to the main guidance. It set out a step-by-step approach to using\u000d\u000a      landscape characterisations as the starting point for judgements about the\u000d\u000a      ability of different types of landscape to accommodate change of specific\u000d\u000a      types, such as wind energy schemes or housing development.\u000d\u000a    Two related topic papers (R2, R5) were also produced by Swanwick as part\u000d\u000a      of a series published by the two agencies to complement the main guidance.\u000d\u000a      Swanwick also wrote a book chapter, at the invitation of the Countryside\u000d\u000a      Agency, to summarise the state of the art in this area of work for a wider\u000d\u000a      audience (R4).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23133","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The route to impact\u000d\u000a    Our impact strategy to change the nature of planting design in urban\u000d\u000a      places included writing articles for professional and public\u000d\u000a      journals\/magazines, plus publishing books that translated the research\u000d\u000a      into practice.

In addition, the Sheffield Green Roof Development Programme directly\u000d\u000a      inspired the initiation of a full-scale green roof programme by the City\u000d\u000a      of Melbourne, Australia, linked with University of Melbourne, following a\u000d\u000a      keynote presentation by Dunnett at the Australian Green Roofs Conference\u000d\u000a      in 2008: `'The City of Melbourne's green roof development programme,\u000d\u000a        and associated initiatives ... was modelled on Nigel Dunnett's work in\u000d\u000a        Sheffield\".

This has had a direct impact on what happens in\u000d\u000a      millions of gardens across the world. Our work was featured as part of a\u000d\u000a      BBC2, three-hour TV programme in February 2012 (S3).\u000d\u000a    Influence on professional guidelines and best practice training.\u000d\u000a    Our approach to the design of the Olympic Park was highlighted in a\u000d\u000a      training video specially commissioned by the Landscape Institute (National\u000d\u000a      Professional Body for Landscape Architecture) for its members (S4). This\u000d\u000a      has been viewed extensively by landscape architects in Britain and around\u000d\u000a      the world, to inform and change practice norms. These impacts have been\u000d\u000a      further extended by books we have written derived from our research, which\u000d\u000a      now form a key part of the literature of Landscape Architecture (such as The\u000a        Dynamic Landscape: Design, Ecology and Management of Naturalistic Urban\u000d\u000a        Planting, Taylor and Francis). These have now been translated into\u000d\u000a      four languages including Chinese and more than 15,000 copies have been\u000d\u000a      sold worldwide.\u000d\u000a    Changes in environmental design standards and professional practice.\u000d\u000a    Our work has re-invigorated planting design throughout the world: \"Sheffield....\u000a        has emerged as the world leader in naturalistic planting, courtesy of\u000d\u000a        .... James Hitchmough and Nigel Dunnett\" (S5). This is evidenced by\u000d\u000a      a raft of invitations to undertake commissions to design examples of this\u000d\u000a      sustainable vegetation in prestigious, heavily visited landscapes (Eden\u000d\u000a      Project Cornwall; Royal Horticultural Society Gardens, Wisley and Hyde\u000d\u000a      Hall; Toyota UK (Derby); London Wetland Centre; Queen's Gallery,\u000d\u000a      Buckingham Palace; Burgess Park, London; Oxford University Botanical\u000d\u000a      Garden; and Cambridge University Botanic Garden). Dunnett's innovative\u000d\u000a      approaches to green roof and rain garden planting have resulted in\u000d\u000a      prestigious and highly public design commissions including the South Bank\u000d\u000a      Centre, London, Google UK's new head office, the head offices of the John\u000d\u000a      Lewis Group (to create Central London's first street-side rain garden),\u000d\u000a      and at Buckingham Palace. In June 2013, Dunnett gave a private tour of the\u000d\u000a      latter garden to Her Majesty The Queen, at her request. In addition to our\u000d\u000a      own work, we have encouraged many others around the world to adopt our\u000d\u000a      approaches (S6, S7).\u000d\u000a    Changes in traditional attitudes and behaviours towards the designed\u000d\u000a        environment and biodiversity\u000d\u000a    Our research and practice has had a profound effect on winning support\u000d\u000a      amongst practitioners and the public for the use of ecologically based,\u000d\u000a      but culturally responsive vegetation in designed urban landscapes. In part\u000d\u000a      this is because we have shown through our research how vegetation that is\u000d\u000a      attractive to people can, with only small adjustments, also be highly\u000d\u000a      sustainable and good for biodiversity. The Royal Horticultural Society,\u000d\u000a      traditionally ambivalent or even hostile to ecological approaches has used\u000d\u000a      the Olympic Park wildflower meadows as a springboard for its 2013 public\u000d\u000a      campaign on increasing urban sustainability and diversity. Sue Biggs, RHS\u000d\u000a      Director General, says: \"After enjoying the Olympic Park meadows in\u000d\u000a        2012 there is a great appetite from the British public to create their\u000d\u000a        own version at home, which is great news for pollinating insects\"\u000d\u000a      (S8). In addition it has commissioned the authors to design over 15ha of\u000d\u000a      horticultural wildflower meadows at one of its UK gardens demonstrating\u000d\u000a      how its attitudes to conservation have been changed. Hitchmough was\u000d\u000a      awarded a Fellowship in May 2013 from the British Naturalists Association\u000d\u000a      for outstanding contribution to natural history. Dunnett's Green roof on\u000d\u000a      Sharrow Junior School (Sheffield) is the only designed green roof in the\u000d\u000a      world that has been awarded formal government Nature Reserve Status.\u000d\u000a    Help in shaping the 2012 Olympic experience and the UK's global\u000d\u000a        reputation\u000d\u000a    We were head-hunted by the Olympic Development Authority (ODA) to lead on\u000d\u000a      the planting design of the London 2012 Olympic Park. This involved\u000d\u000a      developing a new planting strategy for the whole site based on our\u000d\u000a      research, designing and specifying the plant communities and supervising\u000d\u000a      implementation. \"At the brief stage I made it very clear that I wanted\u000d\u000a        James Hitchmough and Nigel Dunnett to be involved.

We were the first researchers in the world to apply rigorous\u000d\u000a      ecological experimentation to the design of urban plant communities and\u000d\u000a      much of our research has been published in Landscape and Urban\u000d\u000a        Planning, one of the most highly ranked journals in Urban Studies.\u000d\u000a    Our work has focused on producing vegetation that is exceptionally\u000d\u000a      attractive to the public, producing colourful flowers from spring to\u000d\u000a      autumn, as a means of gaining public support to allow functions such as\u000d\u000a      biodiversity enhancement and water management to be achieved without\u000d\u000a      alienating the large number of people in urban places who are unreceptive\u000d\u000a      to environmental issues. We investigated a range of plant communities with\u000d\u000a      key aesthetic or functional attributes, and used these as hybrid\u000d\u000a      ecological\/design models. We evolved a standardised protocol for the work,\u000d\u000a      generally starting at laboratory or glasshouse scale with individual\u000d\u000a      species, and then moving to multi-species microcosm experiments and\u000d\u000a      finally to field or practice scale experiments. In developing our work we\u000d\u000a      have collaborated with a variety of organisations; however their role was\u000d\u000a      always limited to the provision of technical and other forms of practical\u000d\u000a      support.\u000d\u000a    Initial research looked at the fundamental issues of whether\u000d\u000a      horticultural species with presumed poor ecological fitness could compete\u000d\u000a      when sown or planted with naturally occurring native species. We ran two\u000d\u000a      experiments over 6 year periods: 1993-1999 (R1) and 2001-2006 (R6) which\u000d\u000a      showed that persistence and fitness were not necessarily defined by\u000d\u000a      nativeness per se, but rather by the specific conditions of the\u000d\u000a      site: knowledge that we used to underpin our subsequent philosophical and\u000d\u000a      ecological approach. Both of these studies were run in conjunction with\u000d\u000a      external partners (Scottish Agricultural Colleges for (R1) and ARK DM, a\u000d\u000a      Sheffield based Architectural practice for (R6)), who supported the\u000d\u000a      research by allowing us to use their facilities over long periods of time.\u000d\u000a    Research from 1999 onwards (R2, R3) has focused on establishing\u000d\u000a      communities from seed sown in situ, as a means of using seedling\u000d\u000a      density to manage competition with weeds. This method also allowed us to\u000d\u000a      engineer very large areas of these plant communities with limited budgets.\u000d\u000a      Aspects of this work were supported through technical collaboration with\u000d\u000a      the RHS (Royal Horticultural Society) and later by a Marie Curie TOK grant\u000d\u000a      (2006-9, &#163;256K) with a large international seed company, Jelitto Seeds,\u000d\u000a      Germany. This research also generated methods of effectively controlling\u000d\u000a      seedling weeds, the soil weed seed bank that would otherwise lead to the\u000d\u000a      elimination of the sown species, plus the number of seedlings\/m2\u000d\u000a      of each sown species (R5). This latter study was supported by the\u000d\u000a      Malaysian Department of Agriculture via a PhD Scholarship.\u000d\u000a    Research published in 2006 (R4) confirmed that our designed plant\u000d\u000a      communities could be successfully and sustainably managed by using nature\u000d\u000a      conservation techniques such as cutting or burning, rather than by\u000d\u000a      traditional, expensive and highly labour intensive techniques. These\u000d\u000a      innovations enabled close control of the composition of sown, designed\u000d\u000a      plant communities that was a pre-requisite for large scale application to\u000d\u000a      landscape practice.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23141","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Westminster's research has contributed to significant\u000d\u000a      improvements in the management and experience of the night-time economy in\u000d\u000a      England and Wales and hence to social, economic and environmental\u000d\u000a      sustainability.\u000d\u000a    The Purple Flag scheme was directly informed by the University of\u000d\u000a      Westminster's body of research on the night-time economy and good practice\u000d\u000a      in the management of night-time city centres.

The research demonstrated that more people would go to town\u000d\u000a      centres in the evening and at night if centres were more accessible, had\u000d\u000a      less anti-social behaviour and offered more choice with regard to places\u000d\u000a      to eat and drink, live performance and festivals and highlighted best\u000d\u000a      practice with regard to their management through partnerships.\u000d\u000a    Paul Davies of the Civic Trust drew extensively on the University's\u000d\u000a      research in NightVision, the final report for the Special Project,\u000d\u000a      in 2006 (see section 5). Pages 101-103 demonstrate that the University of\u000d\u000a      Westminster's research comprised four of the seven studies. The findings\u000d\u000a      were reinterpreted and repackaged as assessment criteria and evaluation\u000d\u000a      methodology for Purple Flag scheme. The Purple Flag web-site refers to the\u000d\u000a      research undertaken for the Special Project as the `Civic Trust research'\u000d\u000a      as underpinning the Purple Flag criteria. The scheme, administered by Paul\u000d\u000a      Davies, is currently hosted by the Association of Town Centre Managers\u000d\u000a      (ATCM) and is backed by central government. At the time of writing thirty\u000d\u000a      six town centres in thirty-five local authority areas have achieved Purple\u000d\u000a      Flag status.\u000d\u000a    The University of Westminster research has therefore had a demonstrable\u000d\u000a      impact on the environment of night-time town and city centres. This impact\u000d\u000a      does not only relate to the introduction of a new policy instrument, but\u000d\u000a      has also been acknowledged by businesses and individuals. To illustrate, a\u000d\u000a      study commissioned by Purple Flag found economic benefits from\u000d\u000a      accreditation. These include a 13% increase in footfall in comparison to\u000d\u000a      other similar places, in the context of the night-time economy having a\u000d\u000a      value of &#163;6.6bn p.a., employing 1.3m people and producing 27% of town and\u000d\u000a      city turnover. Purple Flag accredited centres enjoy a raised profile and\u000d\u000a      an improved public image, wider patronage from different social groups,\u000d\u000a      lower crime and anti- social behaviour and a more successful mixed-use\u000d\u000a      economy.\u000d\u000a    The output of the desktop study (see Section 2) influenced policy and\u000d\u000a      practitioners.

The context was the expansion in\u000d\u000a      youth oriented bars and clubs from the late 1990s onwards. The Licensing\u000d\u000a      Act 2003 (implemented November 2005) and '24 hour drinking' drew much\u000d\u000a      comment from the media about binge drinking and crime and disorder.\u000d\u000a    The research underpinning the impacts claimed was carried out in several\u000d\u000a      projects. As Prof Roberts was PI for all, each informed the other.\u000d\u000a      Co-researchers were all drawn from the University of Westminster. The\u000d\u000a      first project (2001-2002), with Dr Turner, was a study of night-time\u000d\u000a      activities in Soho. This study used an innovative method of time-lapse\u000d\u000a      video recording to demonstrate that the negative externalities associated\u000d\u000a      with increased night-time activities were caused by the sheer volume of\u000d\u000a      people and vehicles involved.\u000d\u000a    The second project (2002-2003) was a study of entertainment districts in\u000d\u000a      London, Berlin, Copenhagen and Dublin with Dr Turner (until University\u000d\u000a      2003), Prof Bailey, Prof Osborn and Steven Greenfield. Here a key insight\u000d\u000a      was the importance of taking a holistic approach to planning and licensing\u000d\u000a      for the night-time economy.\u000d\u000a    The third project focused on good practice in the management of\u000d\u000a      night-time city centres (2003- 2006). The Civic Trust administered the\u000d\u000a      project under the Special Projects Scheme, for the Office of the Deputy\u000d\u000a      Prime Minister (ODPM). The Civic Trust commissioned the University of\u000d\u000a      Westminster to carry out four separate studies. A national survey of\u000d\u000a      evening and night-time activities in England (2003), with Dr Gornostaeva\u000d\u000a      (until 2004), highlighted the number of local authorities experiencing\u000d\u000a      problems with their night-time economies and others looking for expansion.\u000d\u000a      The other three studies were undertaken with Dr Eldridge. A survey of\u000d\u000a      national and regional operators (2004-2005) combined with the `Hotspots'\u000d\u000a      research (2005) which investigated operators and partnership working in\u000d\u000a      five selected towns in England whose night-time economies were regarded as\u000d\u000a      problematic, directed attention to the importance of partnership working\u000d\u000a      and the barriers to its smooth operation, in particular divisions between\u000d\u000a      licensees. A need for sharper intervention on the part of government was\u000d\u000a      also shown. `After Dark: Perceptions of `Going Out' in Town Centres at\u000d\u000a        Night' (2006) was a focus group study in another five locations with\u000d\u000a      reluctant and\/or non- participants in night-time economy. This highlighted\u000d\u000a      the importance of the availability of transport, a diversity of food and\u000d\u000a      drink offer, live entertainment and `cultural animation' such as free\u000d\u000a      festivals to attract people out. The ODPM also commissioned a desk-top\u000d\u000a      study of best practice in management in the night-time economy (Prof\u000d\u000a      Roberts). This review demonstrated the extent of partnership working and\u000d\u000a      detailed best practice.\u000d\u000a    Prof Roberts acted as a Specialist Adviser to a House of Commons Select\u000d\u000a      Committee (see ODPM: Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions\u000d\u000a      Committee The Evening Economy and the Urban Renaissance Twelfth\u000d\u000a      Report of Session 2002-03 HC396-1) and its follow-up session in 2004-05\u000d\u000a      (HC456).

As one Defra office stated \"There\u000d\u000a        is, over the last five years,\u000d\u000a        no academic research institution that has either had more impact or has\u000d\u000a        influenced to a greater\u000d\u000a        extent, our approach to farmer behaviours, advice and land management\u000d\u000a        environmental issues\"\u000d\u000a      [b].\u000d\u000a    The research informed recommendations by the independent Farming\u000d\u000a      Regulation Task Force\u000d\u000a      (May, 2011) on the need for clear communication of advice and the\u000d\u000a      importance of working with\u000d\u000a      farmers [b]. The study's good practice principles were used directly in\u000d\u000a      Defra's key principles for the\u000d\u000a      provision of advice, as stated in Annex 3 of Defra's Review of Advice,\u000d\u000a      Incentives and Partnership\u000d\u000a      Approaches, published as a Business Plan Commitment in March 2013 [e].\u000d\u000a      This review also\u000d\u000a      evidenced CCRI's evaluations in identifying the drivers leading farmers to\u000d\u000a      seek advice.

The\u000d\u000a      research on co-operative working demonstrated that successful\u000d\u000a      agri-environmental co-operatives\u000d\u000a      can be encouraged, through facilitation, to work collectively for\u000d\u000a      environmental gain. A direct impact\u000d\u000a      of this work was the employment of 18 Commons Development Officers (in\u000d\u000a        situ) operating across\u000d\u000a      Wales whose task is to develop the confidence and capacity of Commoners to\u000d\u000a      apply for collective\u000d\u000a      agri-environment schemes. Approximately 90% of Commons in Wales reportedly\u000d\u000a      subscribe to and\u000d\u000a      work with these Officers [f].\u000d\u000a    The CCRI research was also used at practitioner level by the Agricultural\u000d\u000a      Industries Confederation\u000d\u000a      (AIC Value of Advice report, April 2013) to develop an understanding of\u000d\u000a      farmers' different sources\u000d\u000a      of advice and to highlight the importance of farm management advice from\u000d\u000a      one trusted source.

This stimulated a CCRI study for Exmoor National Park Authority\u000d\u000a      (ENPA) and Natural\u000d\u000a      England exploring participatory policy development in the uplands by Dwyer\u000d\u000a        and Short [2], which\u000d\u000a      worked with farmers to develop an alternative, `Ecosystem Services'\u000d\u000a      approach, now being taken\u000d\u000a      forward by ENPA.

Findings\u000d\u000a      showed how farmers differ in their\u000d\u000a      engagement with initiatives and that this is influenced by how advice is\u000d\u000a      given; who gives advice\u000d\u000a      and how the message and messenger are evaluated; and how the farmer's\u000d\u000a      capacity and\u000d\u000a      willingness to change is affected.

The\u000a      construction, by CCRI, of the national retail markets database of\u000a      traditional food markets was endorsed by the All Party Parliamentary\u000a      Markets Group (A). The Department for Communities and Local Government\u000a      (DCLG) Select Committee Report, Market failure? Can the traditional\u000a        market survive? (2009) used the CCRI research to establish a markets\u000a      working group and to create a ministerial role within DCLG for traditional\u000a      markets. DCLG's Good Practice Guide for Markets also included a number of\u000a      CCRI recommendations. In addition, NABMA used the CCRI research in its\u000a      submission to the Mary Portas Review of the High Street (2011),\u000a      sponsored by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. NABMAs Love\u000a        Your Local Market (2013) campaign was a direct outcome of the CCRI\u000a      research. [A]\u000a    The research team in the SOLINSA project worked in partnership\u000a      with two community food groups. It made an active contribution to the\u000a      development and structure of the second Brighton and Hove Food Strategy\u000a      (Digging Deeper, 2012) in the areas of food awareness, safe affordable\u000a      food and providing sustainable food and waste recycling. The team also\u000a      worked with the Permaculture Association in actively improving its\u000a      marketing strategies and developing its strategies for linking with the\u000a      farming industry and for research. The team also facilitated two\u000a      `strategic review' discussion groups for the Association. According to the\u000a      Permaculture Association Chief Executive, the CCRI's work \"helped to\u000a        develop an innovative `co-housing' project with Leeds City Council and\u000a        housing associations ....... that included community food growing within\u000a        the overall project brief\" (B).\u000a    The social impacts of fishing research led directly to changes in\u000a      the Shellfish Regulations for England's inshore waters. It was also used\u000a      directly by Defra as a principal input to their economic assessment of the\u000a      impact of such fishing to the tourism economy of coastal communities, and\u000a      their social assessment of the welfare of these communities (25\/03\/2011)\u000a      (E). In addition, the findings were utilised by Defra in informing the\u000a      creation of Marine Conservation Zones.\u000a    In the Local Food Project, the CCRI evaluated the &#163;60 million\u000a      initiative by the Big Lottery (2009 on) that encouraged local food growing\u000a      and capacity building within the community. The whole programme benefited\u000a      from the CCRI's evaluation through the dissemination of both principles\u000a      and good practice. A project instigator has noted, \"I have enormously\u000a        valued the robust, rigorous and objective discussions within the CCRI\u000a        team on working out the best approaches; something that doesn't happen\u000a        very often within organisations and project delivery\" (C). The\u000a      project is being managed by Royal Society of Wild Trusts (RSWT), who's\u000a      manager notes that \"through\u000a        communications all [Local Food] projects have benefitted in some way\"\u000a      and that the strategic impact of the research had been considerable,\u000a      allowing the management team to \"pitch the outcomes and emerging trends\u000a        of Local Food with robust evidence to the Big Lottery Fund policy\u000a        colleagues, addressing the wider context of community impact and not\u000a        just environment and food growing\" (D). The work of the CCRI on the\u000a      Local Food project is on-going but the RSWT project manager has commented\u000a      that whilst several organisations contribute understanding to the project,\u000a      the work of the CCRI has been `critical'.\u000a    The sustainable food organisation, f3 has worked with the CCRI on\u000a      the SOLINSA, SUPURB and Local Food projects. According to\u000a      their Associate Director the research has \"demystified the\u000a        notions of evaluation and impact for local food practitioners\"\u000a      allowing communities on the ground to gain a better understanding of their\u000a      own influence (C). Importantly, the CCRI has facilitated crossover between\u000a      academics and practitioners, leading to practitioners publishing academic\u000a      works and academics becoming directly involved in the local food movement.\u000a    The CCRI places considerable emphasis on informing wider societal debates\u000a      around food production and consumption and its wider impacts. An example\u000a      of this can be seen in the Local Food evaluation where the CCRI's report\u000a      was presented to a conference of 500 delegates in the local food sector\u000a      (October 2012) and informed the creation of 3 films, shown on Community\u000a      Channel (23 July 2013) (F). The research team have also contributed to\u000a      national debates, such as Kirwan's contribution to BBC Radio 4's `Farming\u000a      Today' and `Today' programmes regarding Farmers' Markets (25 June 2012)\u000a      (G). In addition, CCRIs involvement in events such as the Royal Society on\u000a      `Sustainable Intensification as the Future of Farming' (May 2013) (H)\u000a      reflects the significance of its contribution to this debate.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The CCRI's extensive programme of funded research (for the EU, UK\u000a      government, research councils, private and the voluntary sectors) into\u000a      local and sustainable food has impacted at both national and local levels.\u000a      Nationally, it has led directly to changes in fishing regulations (Defra),\u000a      adjustments to ministerial roles (DCLG), changes in the implementation of\u000a      the Big Lottery's Local Food programme and the successful development of\u000a      traditional food markets.

Ilbery and Maye supervised two ESRC funded PhD\u000a      studentships concerned with the social relationships around food\u000a      distribution and retailing. One with the Soil Association examining the\u000a      potential of buying groups to increase access to organic produce (Little)\u000a      [C] and one with the National Association of British Market Authorities\u000a      (NABMA) (Smith), assessing the role of street markets in fresh food\u000a      provisioning.\u000a    The Freshstart initiative, which was evaluated by Kirwan\u000a      and Ingram, (2005-2008), and built on Kirwan's earlier work, was\u000a      funded through Cornwall Agricultural Council Development Trust (CACDT)\u000a      under Objective 1 funding, and offered a package of measures to both\u000a      farming entrepreneurs entering the industry and farmers wishing to leave.\u000a      Key to its evaluation [D] was a concern to understand how the local\u000a      farming community in Cornwall could be made more socially sustainable by\u000a      matching entrants with those hoping to leave the industry.\u000a    SOLINSA (EU, Framework VII, 2010-2013, Ingram and Kirwan),\u000a      examined innovations in learning and information flows within and between\u000a      communities to assist in the development of the practice of sustainable\u000a      agriculture. Of two case studies, one has involved working with the\u000a      Brighton and Hove Food Partnership, whereby the latter have been a\u000a      research partner rather than a research subject. It focused on linking\u000a      food to energy, waste and health to maximise the benefits of local food\u000a      production.\u000a    The Social Impact of Inshore Fisheries (Reed and Courtney,\u000a      2010-2011) was funded by Defra as part of their programme Sustainable\u000a        Access to Inshore Fisheries (SAIF), examined the contribution made\u000a      by smaller commercial fishing business to their local community. The\u000a      research [E] reported on the symbolic and cultural role of inshore fishing\u000a      in creating a sense of place and how that underpinned the tourism economy\u000a      and related niche food sectors.\u000a    Local Food (LF) is a &#163;60 million funding programme to help make\u000a      locally grown food accessible and affordable to communities. The fund is\u000a      managed by the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts (RSWT) and was evaluated\u000a      by the CCRI (Kirwan and Ilbery, 2009-2014). The research\u000a      [F] focused on affecting change at a community level and the need to\u000a      support projects that are using food as a creative medium through which to\u000a      develop community capacity across a spectrum of issues, including health\u000a      and well-being.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23228","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In the past twenty-five years there has been a fundamental shift in the\u000d\u000a      legal and constitutional\u000d\u000a      foundations of government relations with the indigenous peoples in the\u000d\u000a      common law jurisdictions of\u000d\u000a      Canada and Australasia.

The\u000a      scientific research at CURBE has been instrumental in managing and\u000a      reducing risk and will continue to save lives.\u000a    Mainly concentrating on natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods,\u000a      volcanoes and tsunamis, the fundamental research at CURBE seeks to reduce\u000a      the risk of these perils, by analysing past events, developing new methods\u000a      of modelling and bringing together close cooperation between architects,\u000a      engineers, earth scientists and public health specialists.\u000a    Much of this work has been conducted jointly with Cambridge Architectural\u000a      Research (CAR) Ltd (of which Spence and So are Directors), who has\u000a      contributed modelling and data analysis expertise to extend the basic\u000a      research undertaken at CURBE into applications. Two major research areas\u000a      which have exploited CURBE's long understanding of earthquake risk are\u000a      presented here.\u000a    The first is in the assessment of vulnerability of buildings, the likely\u000a      building damage and human casualties from earthquakes. Spence pioneered\u000a      the work in the classification of damage by classes of building and levels\u000a      of damage (Coburn and Spence, 2002). The methodology and data developed by\u000a      CURBE are central to models in use today for both pricing and\u000a      exposure-limitation in insurance and reinsurance; the Global Earthquake\u000a      Vulnerability Estimation System (GEVES), (Spence et al., 2008) being one.\u000a      Fundamental to the methodology is the collection and analysis of empirical\u000a      data. UK's Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT) which\u000a      was co-founded by Spence in 1982 is now partly funded by EPSRC as the\u000a      council's on-going commitment to bettering seismic data collection and\u000a      research. EPSRC has also funded CURBE members on visits to damaged areas\u000a      after the Pisco, 2007, Wenchuan 2008, Samoa, 2009, L'Aquila 2009, Haiti,\u000a      2010 and Tohoku, 2011 earthquakes.\u000a    The estimation of earthquake induced casualties is crucial to planning\u000a      mitigation and emergency management strategies. This work was first\u000a      carried out in LessLoss (2005-2007 EU funding, Spence as PI). So\u000a      has since been actively involved in the assessment of human casualties,\u000a      improving understanding of how casualties occur in natural disasters and\u000a      providing key parameters for loss estimation models.\u000a    The second related area is in the innovative use of remote sensing for\u000a      post-disaster damage and recovery. In Use of remote sensing for\u000a        earthquake damage assessment (2001- 2004 EPSRC funding, Spence as\u000a      PI), then-newly available high-resolution satellite images were analysed,\u000a      and a range of techniques (manual and computerised) for preparing damage\u000a      mapping were developed. The skills developed by Saito (2001 -2012) are\u000a      currently used for the World Bank's post disaster needs assessment.\u000a    CURBE's skills in remote imagery interpretation were further strengthened\u000a      in Monitoring of post disaster recovery (EPSRC 2008-2010,\u000a      Chenvidyakarn as PI). The techniques developed for assessing\u000a      post-earthquake damage were applied for the first time to monitor the\u000a      process of recovery. CURBE subsequently obtained EPSRC Follow-up funding\u000a      (2010-2011, Ramage as PI) to develop these techniques into tools suitable\u000a      for use by agencies working in the field, and EU funding for SENSUM (So as\u000a      PI), a Framework to integrate Space-based and in-situ sENSing for dynamic\u000a      vUlnerability and recovery Monitoring (2013-2014).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23292","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    MEPLAN software developed by ME&amp;P from the work of Echenique has been\u000a      used extensively by the UK Government in LASER (London And South East\u000a      Region) model for London Crossrail, Thames Gateway, Congestion Charging,\u000a      and has become the core of the DfT National Transport Model4,.\u000a    Cambridge Futures has had impact on the planning of Cambridge3:\u000a      \"It paved the way for a more positive planning strategy for Cambridge\u000a        which provided housing closer to where the jobs were being created, by\u000a        achieving higher densities on existing brownfield sites, a radical\u000a        review of the inner boundary of the Green Belt to provide urban\u000a        extensions, and a New Town to the north west of Cambridge connected to\u000a        the city by high quality public transport.\u000a    Cambridge's growth strategy has recently been described as `smart' by\u000a        the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and last week was praised by the\u000a        Planning Minister for its positive approach to achieving high quality\u000a        growth that is making a major contribution to the UK's economy.

Pre-period\u000a      there have been three spin-out companies, Marcial Echenique &amp; Partners\u000a      Limited (ME&amp;P), Marcial Echenique S.A. (MECSA in Spain) and Transporti\u000a      e Territorio SRL (TRT in Italy) which have been key to this interaction\u000a      between research and practice.\u000a    The special issue of Environment &amp; Planning B edited by Owers and\u000a      Echenique (1994)1 is devoted to the work originating with\u000a      Echenique's group.

Bringing\u000a      these strands together served not only to illustrate the applicability of\u000a      the integrated models, but to examine the difficulties in calibrating\u000a      models and testing underlying assumptions, particularly with respect to\u000a      human behaviour.\u000a    Echenique's group used their approach to examine the development\u000a      possibilities for central Chile in 19942.\u000a    In the Cambridge Futures Project3,4, this research moved on to\u000a      consider strategic planning alternatives for the Cambridge sub-region.\u000a      This notably incorporated input from the public in testing model\u000a      assumptions &#8212; which has been held up as exemplary practice (see section\u000a      4). This also included consideration of the impact of congestion charging\u000a      in the city of Cambridge.\u000a    The SOLUTIONS project built on the Cambridge Futures Project, and carried\u000a      out case studies of three UK city regions to test the sustainability of\u000a      the planning policy trend over a 30 year period compared against the\u000a      alternative policies of compaction, planned expansion or dispersal 5.\u000a      Non-academic partners allowed use of their policy testing models\u000a      (developed by Echenique), notably the Departments for Transport and the\u000a      Communities and Local Government that jointly provided financial support\u000a      for option testing, and the Cambridgeshire County Council and the Tyne and\u000a      Wear local authorities. The subsequent ReVISIONS project (2008-12) funded\u000a      by EPSRC and EEDA explored how spatial planning affects the potential for\u000a      green technologies. It developed an enhanced version of MEPLAN extended to\u000a      include buildings, energy, water and waste.\u000a    A particular research output was the conclusion that land use allocations\u000a      and transport configurations will have little impact on reducing carbon\u000a      dioxide emissions over the next 30 years: the broadly different spatial\u000a      policies of dispersal or compaction make less than +5% or -5% difference\u000a      in energy use by transport5.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23400","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research has been widely disseminated in the healthcare and\u000a      architectural community.

Most recently they have examined the additional complexities\u000a      that arise in buildings for healthcare, such as resilience in heatwaves,\u000a      prodigious internal heat gains, vulnerable occupants and airborne\u000a      cross-infection concerns.\u000a    The initial work undertaken by Short and colleagues in natural stack\u000a      ventilation and passive cooling included designs for Farsons' Brewery\u000a      Process Block Malta (completed 1990), which won first prize in Architecture\u000a        Today's High Architecture, Low Energy Awards 1992, and was a\u000a      finalist in the Design Museum's Design Sense Award competition 1999; the\u000a      Queens Building at De Montfort University (1993), awarded Green Building\u000a      of the Year 1995 by The Independent; and the 110,000ft2\u000a      Lanchester Library and Learning Resource Centre for Coventry University\u000a      (2000), thought to be the first modern naturally conditioned deep plan\u000a      building in the world, [1]\u000a    Short and his team then evolved the approach further to deliver cooling\u000a      benefit within the London Urban Heat Island by the introduction of Passive\u000a      Downdraught Cooling (PDC). This low-energy technique distributes\u000a      pre-cooled air into the building without mechanical fan assistance,\u000a      extending its range. The underlying principles of the technique were\u000a      explored using physical models, and the anticipated performance predicted\u000a      using thermal modelling.[1] These ideas were then applied in the design\u000a      and construction of the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies\u000a      (2006), believed to be the first large-scale application of PDC, and an\u000a      international competition winner in 2003. A significant extension of these\u000a      ideas for use in a continental climate was the incorporation of a\u000a      breathing double envelope, with modelling undertaken for Chicago [6] and\u000a      Beijing.\u000a    The UK Department of Health (DH) first became interested in Short's work\u000a      through the publicity surrounding Coventry University Library. The DH\u000a      Director of Estates and Facilities and DH Chief Architect asked Short if\u000a      this work could provide a template for a radically different very\u000a      low-energy acute hospital. In addition, in 2001, Short won the Braunstone\u000a      Health and Social Care Centre competition for an innovative 40,000 ft2\u000a      integrated centre in Leicester, funded through the New Deal for\u000a      Communities, to house seven clinical and social services. The building &#8212;\u000a      passively pre-cooled and pre-warmed by a below-ground labyrinth &#8212; became a\u000a      SHINE Learning Network for Sustainable Healthcare Buildings exemplar case\u000a      study. Interaction with the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)\u000a      then led to a series of further projects.\u000a    One such project considered existing hospital buildings typical of those\u000a      operated by four NHS Trusts. The buildings were monitored, and current\u000a      performance simulated using dynamic thermal models calibrated against the\u000a      measured data; future performance was also simulated against the\u000a      appropriate UKCIP 09 predictive climate base for 2030, 2050 and 2080. Most\u000a      were found to be significantly vulnerable to summer overheating. Short and\u000a      his colleagues proposed adaptive cooling and ventilation refurbishment\u000a      options to increase resilience, and predicted relative performance against\u000a      existing internal conditions, energy demands and CO2 emissions.\u000a      For example, a detailed study of a representative late 1960s tower [2]\u000a      showed that the building could achieve good resilience to overheating\u000a      until 2080 with relatively non-invasive and energy-saving modifications\u000a      and, surprisingly, that there would be significant mitigation co-benefits.\u000a      Similar conclusions arose from work on mid-rise 1970s ward blocks.[3]\u000a    Furthermore, a similar study of a 1920s traditional heavyweight masonry\u000a      block revealed the unsuspectedly significant resilience of cross-vented\u000a      open `Nightingale' wards.[4] This study demonstrated that significant\u000a      resilience to overheating in the face of changing climate &#8212; and also\u000a      energy savings &#8212; could be achieved by light-touch measures. When the\u000a      communal bed layout of Nightingale wards led to this type being condemned\u000a      by then Under-Secretary of State Hazel Blears, Short and his team\u000a      investigated various reconfigurations of the Nightingale interior (in the\u000a      DeDeRHECC project). They demonstrated that care closer to present care\u000a      models can be delivered, recovering the innate resilience of type (i.e.\u000a      zig-zag bedspace layout option dubbed the `Business Class' option by\u000a      Cabinet Office 2012).\u000a    Short and colleagues also investigated the application of the\u000a      underpinning ideas about passive cooling and natural ventilation to new\u000a      build hospitals, and found them equally effective.[5]\u000a    Throughout these collaborations, Short as PI researched the DH and NHS\u000a      Trust context; digitally reconstructed the individual NHS buildings (both\u000a      as built and as existing); led the interface with the four NHS Trusts and\u000a      DH; designed all options for new build and refurbishment adaptations.\u000a      Lomas (De Montfort and Loughborough) led on thermal data collection and\u000a      modelling. Cath Noakes (Leeds) led on the infection control aspects of\u000a      adaptation designs. Clarkson (Cambridge, Engineering) examined user health\u000a      worker\/patient\/building interaction.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23953","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Concrete is the most ubiquitous of all building materials, available and\u000d\u000a      used globally, with cement (its active ingredient) consumed in excess of\u000d\u000a      2000 million tonnes annually.

It began in\u000d\u000a      2004 as a research-led teaching programme; an innovative methodology\u000d\u000a      within University-based architectural research. The aim was to explore the\u000d\u000a      viability of using flexible formwork for concrete, facilitating the\u000d\u000a      development of forms that are difficult to achieve using conventional,\u000d\u000a      rigid methods and allowing less skilled workers to achieve better quality\u000d\u000a      results with a reduced environmental impact. With outputs including a\u000d\u000a      prize-winning book, the first of its kind in the subject area, and\u000d\u000a      Pedreschi's supervision of the first PhD thesis in the subject area, the\u000d\u000a      Alliance's research sits within the growing body of innovation studies on\u000d\u000a      `disruptive technologies' &#8212; those that may revolutionise existing ways of\u000d\u000a      doing things.\u000d\u000a    The principal researcher is Prof Remo Pedreschi (1989-present). Since\u000d\u000a      2005, Pedreschi has undertaken 18 Fabric Formed Concrete studies in which,\u000d\u000a      with trainee architects in a workshop environment, he has developed,\u000d\u000a      designed and constructed concrete architectural components, such as walls,\u000d\u000a      columns, beams and shells, using fabric formwork. The process involves\u000d\u000a      experimentation &#8212; through repeated prototyping and development &#8212; leading\u000d\u000a      to full-scale construction, with progress and outcomes reflected upon and\u000d\u000a      documented at each stage.

Key findings are that fabric\u000d\u000a      formwork improves the quality of, and reduces visible defects in, concrete\u000d\u000a      constructions; makes concrete forms (such as beams etc.) more structurally\u000d\u000a      efficient; can achieve a 25-35% reduction in the carbon footprint of\u000d\u000a      concrete constructions; simplifies the construction process; and allows\u000d\u000a      for a wider range of forms, including those with complex geometries.\u000d\u000a      Emerging themes have been studied in greater depth of technical detail as\u000d\u000a      part of PhD and Masters dissertations in a joint programme, Structural\u000d\u000a      Engineering with Architecture.

As new buildings\u000d\u000a      make up less than 1% of stock each year, and at least 75% of current\u000d\u000a      buildings are estimated to be\u000d\u000a      still standing twenty years hence, radical action needs to be taken with\u000d\u000a      existing built assets if\u000d\u000a      current government targets on reducing emissions are to be met (at least\u000d\u000a      34% below the 1990\u000d\u000a      baseline by 2020 and 80% by 2050). In 2004, the Engineering and Physical\u000d\u000a      Sciences Research\u000d\u000a      Council (EPSRC) and The Carbon Trust took steps to meet this challenge, as\u000d\u000a      the UK moved\u000d\u000a      towards passing the Climate Change Act 2008. Under its Carbon Vision\u000d\u000a      Buildings (CVB)\u000d\u000a      programme, the partnership funded three research projects tackling CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions and the built\u000d\u000a      environment, including Tarbase (Technology Assessment for Radically\u000d\u000a      Improving the Built Asset\u000d\u000a      Base) led by the Alliance's Urban Energy Research Group at Heriot-Watt\u000d\u000a      University (HWU).\u000d\u000a    The aim of the &#163;1.4M Tarbase project was to investigate the potential for\u000d\u000a      significant reductions in\u000d\u000a      CO2 emissions from existing buildings in the period to 2030.\u000d\u000a      The work considered potential\u000d\u000a      reductions from different perspectives, including end use equipment,\u000d\u000a      building fabric, heating, air\u000d\u000a      conditioning and ventilation equipment, on-site generation of heat and\u000d\u000a      power and the carbon\u000d\u000a      intensity of network electricity. Crucially, it also considered the effect\u000d\u000a      of climate change on building\u000d\u000a      energy needs and user acceptance and behavioural trends regarding building\u000d\u000a      use. It ran from 1\u000d\u000a      July 2004 to 31 March 2009 under the leadership of Prof Phil Banfill\u000d\u000a      (1995-present) and Co-Investigators\u000d\u000a      Prof Marcus Newborough (2002-2008) and Dr Gillian Menzies (2000-present),\u000d\u000a      supported by Andrew Peacock, Research Associate and Project Manager\u000d\u000a      (2003-present), Dr David\u000d\u000a      Jenkins, Research Fellow (2005-present), and various researchers from the\u000d\u000a      Universities of De\u000d\u000a      Montfort, Warwick, Surrey, Nottingham and Glasgow.\u000d\u000a    The Alliance research bridged the gap between building stock models\u000d\u000a      (which provide information\u000d\u000a      for policy but insufficient detail for the occupant or building energy\u000d\u000a      manager) and detailed case\u000d\u000a      studies (which provide very specific data that is too finely grained to\u000d\u000a      provide generic guidance). It\u000d\u000a      did this by modelling the energy performance of a number of buildings\u000d\u000a      expected to be prominent in\u000d\u000a      the stock in 2030 &#8212; from domestic properties to offices, supermarkets and\u000d\u000a      schools &#8212; before and\u000d\u000a      after the application of CO2 reducing measures. The buildings\u000d\u000a      were fully specified in terms of\u000d\u000a      construction and location, internal activity, and HVAC (heating,\u000d\u000a      ventilation and air conditioning)\u000d\u000a      systems, with other inputs from hourly climate files in 2005 and 2030. The\u000d\u000a      effect of `demand-side'\u000d\u000a      measures on emissions was assessed by bespoke models of IT\/end use\u000d\u000a      equipment and\u000d\u000a      appliances, lighting, building fabric, glazing and alternative HVAC\u000d\u000a      systems, while the effect of\u000d\u000a      `supply-side' measures was assessed by models developed for photovoltaics,\u000d\u000a      micro-combined heat\u000d\u000a      and power, micro-wind, solar thermal, air- and ground-source heat pumps,\u000d\u000a      heat recovery and\u000d\u000a      battery storage.\u000d\u000a    The project found that it was possible to refurbish buildings to achieve\u000d\u000a      a reduction in CO2 emissions\u000d\u000a      of up to 80% (domestic buildings) and 50% (non-domestic buildings). For\u000d\u000a      dwellings, the cost could\u000d\u000a      be as much as &#163;30k per home, therefore financial `payback' was unlikely to\u000d\u000a      incentivise home\u000d\u000a      owners, who would require subsidies to be able to undertake the optimum\u000d\u000a      range of refurbishments.\u000d\u000a      While internal activity in buildings significantly affects energy use and\u000d\u000a      governs the choice of\u000d\u000a      refurbishment methods, building energy demand is generally poorly\u000d\u000a      understood and satisfying that\u000d\u000a      demand on-site through renewables &#8212; e.g. wind, photovoltaics and Combined\u000d\u000a      Heat and Power\u000d\u000a      (CHP) &#8212; problematic, because the energy is often available when there is\u000d\u000a      no demand and vice\u000d\u000a      versa. The study also found that a warming climate could significantly\u000d\u000a      affect comfort and energy\u000d\u000a      use in buildings without air-conditioning, possibly leading to a rise in\u000d\u000a      CO2 emissions, were the\u000d\u000a      installation of cooling plant to become more widespread.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23955","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This body of research has brought the social, urban and digital\u000d\u000a      environments together in a way that is meaningful to both industry and\u000d\u000a      consumers.

In\u000d\u000a      September that year, King &amp; Partners launched the mobile application\u000d\u000a      `Agent 3.1' for fashion label Phillip Lim.

(See\u000d\u000a      5.1).\u000d\u000a    The Agent 3.1 application was well received within the industry for the\u000d\u000a      power and choice it gave to the consumer. One expert, a Mobile and\u000d\u000a      Emerging Technologies Strategist for [text removed for publication], is\u000d\u000a      quoted as saying it succeeded in \"entirely flipping the script on what\u000d\u000a        we have come to believe are proper app interfaces. [Using the Mobile\u000d\u000a      Acuity MVS] the brand and its agency chose to put ownership and\u000d\u000a        control of the user experience in the hands of the actual user... As\u000d\u000a        simplistic as this sounds, fundamentally, it is actually pretty\u000d\u000a        revolutionary in digital fashion; the new model of marketing mobility.\"\u000d\u000a      (See 5.1).\u000d\u000a    Agent 3.1 used Mobile Acuity's On-Device MVS technology. The company also\u000d\u000a      licenses its platform to clients, enabling them to add visual search\u000d\u000a      capabilities to their own products via Cloud MVS, its `point and click'\u000d\u000a      solution for large-scale campaigns. This solution has been taken up by\u000d\u000a      leading digital media delivery company, 7digital, which, in 2011,\u000d\u000a      integrated Mobile Acuity Cloud's MVS Application Programming Interface\u000d\u000a      (API) with its own API to develop a Visual Music Discovery (VMD) service.\u000d\u000a      With existing retail partner, HMV, it created the first licensed VMD\u000d\u000a      application; the HMV `listening post'.\u000d\u000a    The `listening post' app is one of range of HMV initiatives designed to\u000d\u000a      help the business adapt to the new retail environment. The app is a\u000d\u000a      contemporary reinterpretation of the physical `listening post' that used\u000d\u000a      to be characteristic of HMV high street stores before floor and shelf\u000d\u000a      space was compromised by the need to expand the company's offer beyond\u000d\u000a      music. The technology enables consumers to listen to music previews by\u000d\u000a      simply taking a photo of a CD cover. 7Digital has praised the \"speed\u000d\u000a        and accuracy\" of Mobile Acuity's product and said \"This\u000d\u000a        functionality is a great addition to our leading API, allowing\u000d\u000a        developers and service providers to further integrate innovative music\u000d\u000a        exploration and purchasing into their applications.

They have been used by Tesco in a\u000d\u000a      Grocery app for the mass market and by high-end brands, such as Nike, to\u000d\u000a      reward niche audiences. The former contract was awarded by competitive\u000d\u000a      tender in 2011, with Tesco rating the Mobility Acuity solution better than\u000d\u000a      any offered by a range of international competitors, demonstrating, as it\u000d\u000a      did, extra capabilities beyond those called for in the brief. In the case\u000d\u000a      of Nike, the MVS was used to increase brand awareness by allowing users to\u000d\u000a      create a Limited Edition version of a trainer inspired by a photograph\u000d\u000a      they took: an application for which the agency client, AKQA, won The\u000d\u000a      Revolution Award for Innovation in 2009 and a D&amp;AD Yellow Pencil Award\u000d\u000a      in the same year.\u000d\u000a    TOTeM, too, has been particularly diverse in its impact. In May 2010, the\u000d\u000a      tagging of donated goods was piloted in an Oxfam shop in Manchester as\u000d\u000a      part of Future Everything, an award-winning new media festival and\u000d\u000a      showcase. Over the course of the week-long pilot (called Remember Me),\u000d\u000a      sales in the store increased by 53%, by 47% over the following two weeks\u000d\u000a      and by 19% the week after. The event, which involved patrons recording\u000d\u000a      downloadable audio `stories' about their donations, was covered by the New\u000a        York Times and the BBC (there have now been over 80 print, broadcast\u000d\u000a      and on-line articles published on the research). (See 5.3).\u000d\u000a    On the strength of Remember Me, Oxfam's Board of Directors\u000d\u000a      invited the researchers to develop the Shelflife iPhone\u000d\u000a      application and website (http:\/\/shelflife.oxfam.org.uk\/).\u000d\u000a      Over 1,600 objects were donated and tagged across ten pilot stores in the\u000d\u000a      Manchester area. Feedback suggested that adding stories to secondhand\u000d\u000a      items increased their worth and longevity and reduced disposability. The\u000d\u000a      pilot's success led to Oxfam partnering further research, The Internet of\u000d\u000a      Secondhand Things project, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences\u000d\u000a      Research Council (EP\/K012819\/1).\u000d\u000a    In February 2011, TOTeM was awarded the Best Internet of Things\u000d\u000a      Application at the BE2 Awards for Social Media in the Built Environment.\u000d\u000a      In April the same year, the researchers co-created Tales of a Changing\u000d\u000a        Nation, tagging 81 objects in the National Museum of Scotland (NMS)\u000d\u000a      and allowing visitors to add their own stories using smart phone\u000d\u000a      applications. Transforming the way in which used NMS `handling objects'\u000d\u000a      and engaged with the public about communities and nationhood, Tales of\u000d\u000a        a Changing Nation was showcased at the international MuseumNext\u000d\u000a      conference in Barcelona (May 2012, see 5.4), at the British Museum,\u000d\u000a      Science Museum and National Media Museum and published in the Museums\u000d\u000a      Association Journal. The [text removed for publication] NMS described the\u000d\u000a      work as \"a great example of how museums can not only give visitors more\u000d\u000a        information about objects and stories, but also involve our visitors in\u000d\u000a        adding their own responses to the objects, whether personal reflections\u000d\u000a        or additional resources \" (see 5.5).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Alliance researchers have devised and applied technologies that bridge\u000d\u000a      the gap between the real and virtual worlds, linking digital data to\u000d\u000a      physical entities.

The `things' are the objects we use and encounter every day,\u000d\u000a      many of which can now be tagged and indexed during production so that\u000d\u000a      consumers can read them using mobile devices. The process was originally\u000d\u000a      seen as merely a logistical framework, but researchers at the University\u000d\u000a      of Edinburgh (UoE) identified the potential for more social, cultural and\u000d\u000a      commercial applications, including in the built environment. The research\u000d\u000a      enables mobile phones to recognise or contextualise objects through the\u000d\u000a      use of Quick Response (QR) codes or Mobile Visual Search (MVS)\u000d\u000a      functionality.\u000d\u000a    Alliance researchers are credited with creating the world's first MVS\u000d\u000a      system, based on image recognition software, which allows users to be\u000d\u000a      proactive in associating photographs of real (offline) things with digital\u000d\u000a      (online) media. Its earliest form was Spellbinder: a way of embedding\u000d\u000a      digital content in an object or place simply by taking a photograph of it\u000d\u000a      using an ordinary camera phone. Spellbinder was developed between\u000d\u000a      2004 and 2007 by a team led by Dr Mark Wright (1991-2013) and Dr Anthony\u000d\u000a      Ashbrook (1996-1999; 2004-2005), with trials conducted in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with ODEON cinemas, Pepsi and The Assembly venues. The research resulted\u000d\u000a      in a successful patent application (Publication no: EP1847112 B1) and the\u000d\u000a      formation, by Wright and Ashbrook, of Mobile Acuity, a commercial company\u000d\u000a      which offers two MVS solutions to the market.\u000d\u000a    Spellbinder was developed through action research in an academic\u000d\u000a      environment to allow its creators the time to explore the `idea space'\u000d\u000a      around the technology, i.e. to investigate what it might mean to a variety\u000d\u000a      of users and communities. While working on the project, Wright was also a\u000d\u000a      Research Fellow on Branded Meeting Places (2006-2008) funded by\u000d\u000a      the Research Councils' Designing for the 21st Century programme. The\u000d\u000a      study, led by Prof Richard Coyne (1995 -present), examined the potential\u000d\u000a      of new technologies to support social interaction in city spaces. Working\u000d\u000a      on both projects simultaneously allowed Wright to think about how\u000d\u000a      Spellbinder could be utilised to encourage more participatory exploration\u000d\u000a      of the urban environment and to redefine `place' as a dynamic experience\u000d\u000a      mediated by the tools of mobile and social media.\u000d\u000a    In Branded Meeting Places, the researchers explored the use of mobile\u000d\u000a      phone applications to `tag' places: planting invisible clues in physical\u000d\u000a      or online environments that could prompt memories as to what took place\u000d\u000a      there. Workshops were conducted over the period 2006-2008; several of\u000d\u000a      which involved Prof Chris Speed (2008-present) as participant. The concept\u000d\u000a      of digital tagging became a major theme for Speed as the Principal\u000d\u000a      Investigator of TOTeM (Tales of Things and Electronic Memory).\u000d\u000a      This project was developed during a five-day EPSRC Design in the Digital\u000d\u000a      World `sandpit' in December 2008, supported by the Technology Strategy\u000d\u000a      Board.\u000d\u000a    TOTeM allowed people to attach personal stories, via digital media, to\u000d\u000a      existing artefacts, including buildings and open spaces. The project ran\u000d\u000a      from August 2009 to December 2012 with Dr Andrew Hudson-Smith of\u000d\u000a      University College London as Co-Investigator, responsible for developing\u000d\u000a      the technology. Speed investigated the technology's creative use, working\u000d\u000a      with stakeholders to explore its deployment in different heritage, social\u000d\u000a      and industrial contexts. Other consortium members were Brunel University,\u000d\u000a      The University of Dundee and The University of Salford.\u000d\u000a    A critical aspect of the Alliance's research was to gain a better\u000d\u000a      understanding of the public's concerns around Radio-Frequency\u000d\u000a      Identification (RFID), as well as the value of artefacts and how\u000d\u000a      technology can unlock people's relationship with them. Supported by the\u000d\u000a      National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement, one of the RCUK's\u000d\u000a      `beacon' projects, this was achieved primarily through live `memory\u000d\u000a      capturing' workshops at events such as the Edinburgh International Science\u000d\u000a      Festival, the Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival and Hands\u000d\u000a        on History, led by the BBC. The research found that people respond\u000d\u000a      to physical objects more deeply when they can disconnect them from\u000d\u000a      guarded, public environments and handle them personally. This led to the\u000d\u000a      development of `ghost objects'; touchable substitutes for priceless\u000d\u000a      artefacts.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23956","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Homelessness Act 2002 obliged all local housing authorities in\u000a      England to implement a\u000a      strategy for preventing homelessness. By 2006, while this had led to a\u000a      reduction in the number of\u000a      homeless individuals and families, it was felt that implementation focused\u000a      too much on what the\u000a      Housing Minister criticised as \"gatekeeping... that discouraged people\u000a        from applying for\u000a        assistance\". By setting out a radically different approach to\u000a      homelessness practice, based on\u000a      improving the options for people who seek help, the Pawson-led study for\u000a      ODPM enabled local\u000a      authorities and their partner agencies to fulfil their obligations more\u000a      effectively. In the period\u000a      2006-2009, following implementation of the study's Guide to Good\u000a        Practice, homelessness, as\u000a      officially measured in England, declined by 48%.\u000a    Directly arising from the research recommendations, a new official\u000a      framework for monitoring\u000a      homelessness prevention activity was put in place in 2008. In April that\u000a      year, data collection on\u000a      local authorities' actions under legislation was expanded to include\u000a      figures for homelessness\u000a      prevention and relief taking place outside the statutory framework.\u000a      2011\/12 was the fourth annual\u000a      release of statistics by the Department for Communities and Local\u000a      Government, reporting\u000a      199,000 cases of extra-framework homelessness prevention or relief (a 5%\u000a      increase from\u000a      2010\/11; see 5.1, below). Additionally, the release noted that the data\u000a      series was no longer\u000a      considered `experimental', due to confidence in the response rates and\u000a      quality of the figures.\u000a    In May 2008, the study was cited, in support of UK Government measures\u000a      and statistics, in the\u000a      `Models of innovation and good practice' section of the Australian\u000a      Government's Green Paper\u000a      Which Way Home? A New Approach to Homelessness (see 5.2). In the\u000a      USA, its Guide to Good\u000a        Practice has been described as \"the inspiration\" for the Creating\u000a        Programs that Work toolkits\u000a      produced by the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH), with [text\u000a      removed for\u000a      publication], Advisor to NAEH, saying \"I suggested that NAEH develop\u000a        these guides, based on\u000a        Hal's previous work\" (see 5.3). In 2009, the study informed US\u000a      Federal Government activity,\u000a      undertaken within the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing\u000a      Programme championed\u000a      by President Obama. Focusing on at-risk individuals and families, this\u000a      $1.5bn programme has\u000a      been credited with helping to prevent US homelessness \"soaring\"\u000a      during the recession (again,\u000a      see 5.3).\u000a    In the UK, with an increase in homelessness since the recession,\u000a      particularly in England,\u000a      preventative work continues. People affected by `multiple exclusion\u000a      homelessness' (MEH) are\u000a      one of the most socially marginalised groups, experiencing the sharpest\u000a      end of problems such as\u000a      poverty, substance misuse and engagement in damaging `street' activities.\u000a      High proportions have\u000a      been a victim of violent crime (43%), have attempted suicide (38%) or have\u000a      self-harmed (30%).\u000a      The Alliance's MEH study has already had demonstrable impacts in this\u000a      field, as described\u000a      below.\u000a    The MEH study has had particular input into the work of the Ministerial\u000a      Working Group (MWG) on\u000a      Preventing and Tackling Homelessness, established by [text removed for\u000a      publication] the then\u000a      Housing Minister in 2010. Following high-level briefings to the MWG's\u000a      Officials Working Group,\u000a      researchers were informed that \"the MEH work is very much informing the\u000a        direction of travel for\u000a        the MWG's second report\" (source at Department of Work and Pensions)\u000a      and Fitzpatrick was\u000a      invited to speak directly to Ministers at the House of Commons. This\u000a      briefing resulted in Ministers\u000a      deciding to \"re-shape\" the national strategic approach to\u000a      homelessness prevention in England\u000a      around the study's identified intervention points, with Fitzpatrick's\u000a      assistance. A representative of\u000a      the Government's Homelessness and Support Division describes the influence\u000a      of the MEH\u000a      research, in this regard, as \"fundamental\".\u000a    Published in August 2012 as Making every contact count: A joint\u000a        approach to preventing\u000a        homelessness (see 5.4), the Government's report makes extensive\u000a      reference to the MEH\u000a      research and replicates one of its data tables in full. In particular, the\u000a      focus on early intervention\u000a      points owes much to Bramley's sequencing analysis, which demonstrates that\u000a      `visible' forms of\u000a      homelessness are typically rather late signs of MEH. This insight has been\u000a      of particular value in\u000a      emphasising the need for schools, drugs and alcohol services, and the\u000a      criminal justice system, to\u000a      play a central role in preventative interventions. A Specialist Advisor to\u000a      the Department for\u000a      Communities and Local Government (DCLG), has said \"on every occasion,\u000a        whenever I'm talking\u000a        about tackling single homelessness I mention your conclusions; both\u000a        local authorities and third\u000a        sector providers seem very interested\".\u000a    The MEH study was described by [text removed for publication] the Joseph\u000a      Rowntree Foundation\u000a      as \"utterly game changing\" and of having \"reversed the view &#8212;\u000a        strongly held over decades by\u000a        most in the field &#8212; that homelessness itself contributed to the other\u000a        features of exclusion\" (see\u000a      5.5). It has influenced service planning for distinct segments within the\u000a      MEH population,\u000a      prompting national and local service providers to consider how best to\u000a      design tailored services for\u000a      different subgroups of users with specific combinations of experiences and\u000a      needs. Users of the\u000a      research to date include major service providers, umbrella bodies at a\u000a      range of scales, from the\u000a      European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless\u000a      (FEANTSA) to the\u000a      Glasgow Homelessness Network, and local authorities. In December 2011, The\u000a      City of\u000a      Westminster Council, which has by far the largest concentration of rough\u000a      sleepers in the UK,\u000a      arranged a bespoke seminar on the MEH findings for its commissioned\u000a      service providers. [text\u000a      removed for publication] Thames Reach has described the study as \"required\u000a        reading\" (see 5.6)\u000a      and [text removed for publication], Homeless Link, has said \"I use it\u000a        on an almost daily basis in\u000a        meetings and in consultation responses. [I've also] given it to\u000a        Ministers in [the] Home Office and\u000a        DWP and to senior health officials.\"\u000a    In addition to high-level briefings, the research has been disseminated\u000a      to stakeholders via\u000a      concise `Briefing Papers' (freely downloadable from the Heriot-Watt\u000a      website). Findings were\u000a      presented at a National Launch event chaired by journalist Jon Snow in\u000a      September 2011 and to\u000a      more than 120 local policy makers and practitioners in feedback seminars\u000a      across all seven case\u000a      study cities (between July and October 2011). In Australia, 200\u000a      stakeholders &#8212; mostly\u000a      practitioners &#8212; attended a plenary address on the research in Melbourne in\u000a      May 2013 at the\u000a      Council to Homeless Persons conference. Homelessness agencies in Victoria\u000a      have also\u000a      promoted the work internally.\u000a    Due to interest in the research in Australia, Fitzpatrick was invited to\u000a      submit an article to PARITY,\u000a      the national magazine for Australian homelessness professionals (published\u000a      June 2013). In\u000a      addition, tweets and blog posts have generated coverage in The\u000a        Observer, Inside Housing,\u000a      Community Care, Third Force News, Professional Social\u000a        Work, Drink and Drugs News, Health\u000a        Service Journal, and The Psychologist. In October 2013,\u000a      Fitzpatrick gave a plenary presentation\u000a      on MEH to an International Symposium on Health and Homelessness in London,\u000a      leading to\u000a      interdisciplinary work with medics and clinical psychologists. In\u000a      September 2013, she gave the\u000a      keynote address to the Glasgow Homelessness Network conference, briefing\u000a      150 delegates from\u000a      across the statutory and voluntary sectors in Scotland's largest\u000a      metropolitan area.\u000a    The LankellyChase Foundation is using the work as the evidential basis\u000a      for a &#163;5M programme of\u000a      investment in interventions, as well as research, to address severe and\u000a      multiple disadvantage\u000a      across the UK (see 5.7). The research is also central to the Disadvantaged\u000a      Groups element of\u000a      the Glasgow Community Planning Partnership's `single outcome agreement'\u000a      with the Scottish\u000a      Government: a ten year `plan for place' that sets out some of the shared\u000a      priorities for service\u000a      provision in the city over the next decade, including those related to the\u000a      priority areas of alcohol,\u000a      youth employment and vulnerable people. It has been used by the Economic\u000a      and Social\u000a      Research Council to bring housing research to practitioners, most recently\u000a      in the newsletter of the\u000a      KE project, Evidence (June 2013). On the strength of its major\u000a      impact on policy and practice, as\u000a      well as its scientific quality and exceptional research contribution, the\u000a      study achieved\u000a      `outstanding' status in its final impact assessment by the ESRC.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Alliance research has driven forward a radically different,\u000a      prevention-based approach to\u000a      homelessness, internationally.

It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that many policies and\u000a      strategies to tackle\u000a      homelessness tend to be reactive, rather than anticipatory and prevention\u000a      based. This case study\u000a      highlights the work of researchers to provide the evidence base\u000a      underpinning activist\u000a      interventions to prevent homelessness: an extensive programme of work\u000a      supported by major\u000a      funders including the ESRC, AHRC, European Commission, UK Government and\u000a      Joseph\u000a      Rowntree Foundation.

This government-commissioned\u000a      study investigated the\u000a      nature and effectiveness of a range of `homelessness prevention' methods\u000a      employed by local\u000a      authorities. Detailed case study fieldwork involved in-depth interviews\u000a      with local authority staff,\u000a      local stakeholders and homeless applicants and, additionally, the\u000a      researchers collected activity\u000a      and performance data to triangulate (or otherwise) interviewee testimony.\u000a      As well as revealing\u000a      the potentially substantial impact of identified prevention techniques,\u000a      the research highlighted the\u000a      implications of an `activist approach' in terms of staff recruitment,\u000a      training and working practices.\u000a      It also brought to light the complex, and potentially problematic, legal\u000a      implications of attempting to\u000a      anticipate and prevent &#8212; rather than react to &#8212; homelessness, and\u000a      developed proposals for the\u000a      quantification of prevention activity.\u000a    The study ran from 2004 to 2007. Led by Pawson, the core research team\u000a      also included Dr Gina\u000a      Netto (1995-present) and Prof Colin Jones (1998-present). The emphasis on\u000a      prevention, and the\u000a      impact the study achieved, were of significant interest to Fitzpatrick,\u000a      then Director of the Centre\u000a      for Housing Policy at the University of York. Her decision to relocate to\u000a      Heriot-Watt University in\u000a      2010 was influenced by the study, as well as by her desire to work with\u000a      Pawson and, in her new\u000a      study (see below), with his colleague, Prof Glen Bramley (1994-present).\u000a    Multiple Exclusion Homelessness. Based on a multi-stage\u000a      quantitative survey of `low\u000a      threshold' support service users in seven UK cities, this ESRC-funded\u000a      study provided the first\u000a      statistically robust analysis of routes into `multiple exclusion\u000a      homelessness' (MEH) in the UK. It\u000a      demonstrated the very high degree of overlap between homelessness and\u000a      forms of `deep\u000a      exclusion' such as substance misuse, institutional living (e.g. prison)\u000a      and `street culture activities'\u000a      (e.g. street drinking and begging). Our analysis (2010-2011) indicated\u000a      that the temporal\u000a      sequencing of MEH-relevant experiences was remarkably consistent, with\u000a      substance misuse and\u000a      mental health problems typically occurring earlier in individual MEH\u000a      pathways than\u000a      homelessness. The study also identified five distinct `experiential\u000a      clusters' within the MEH\u000a      population, with the most complex forms of MEH associated with men in\u000a      their 30s and with\u000a      childhood trauma.\u000a    The study ran from May 2009 to February 2011. The core research was\u000a      undertaken by\u000a      Fitzpatrick, Dr Sarah Johnsen (2010-present; York, 2005-2010) and Bramley.\u000a      The last was\u000a      responsible for the statistical analysis (the opportunity to utilise\u000a      Bramley's analytical skills in the\u000a      project having been a key factor in Fitzpatrick moving to Heriot-Watt\u000a      University). The statistical\u000a      analysis, including cluster analyses and logistic regression modelling, in\u000a      conjunction with the\u000a      unique character of the primary data, led to the project's particularly\u000a      impactful findings on\u000a      temporal sequencing and experiential clusters.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23957","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3351879","Name":"Angola"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact achieved by this body of work from 2008 onwards builds on the\u000d\u000a      success of activities\u000d\u000a      undertaken by the Alliance (through CEHS) and Development Workshop (DW) at\u000d\u000a      the end of their\u000d\u000a      collaborative DfID-funded project on urban land issues in Angola.

The in-situ\u000d\u000a      training that DW and the Alliance provided for stakeholders from\u000d\u000a      government, the private sector\u000d\u000a      and NGOs in 2005-2006 led, by design, to a number of pilot projects in\u000d\u000a      urban development;\u000d\u000a      implemented initially by DW for the Provincial Government in Huambo, and\u000d\u000a      followed by further\u000d\u000a      urban expansion and development, continuing up to the present day.\u000d\u000a      Described by a\u000d\u000a      representative of the World Bank (see 5.2) as \"extremely important\u000d\u000a        `learning-by-doing' for the\u000d\u000a        government of Angola\", these include Camussamba in F&#225;tima and a\u000d\u000a      housing reserve in Calima.\u000d\u000a    As corroborated by [text removed for publication] DW (see 5.1), the\u000d\u000a      capacity building strategy\u000d\u000a      developed jointly by the Alliance and DW has been \"very effective\"\u000d\u000a      and \"resulted in the\u000d\u000a        implementation of land management and housing demonstration projects in\u000d\u000a        five provinces and the\u000d\u000a        training of administrators and technicians from over 40 municipalities\u000d\u000a        from 15 of Angola's 18\u000d\u000a        provinces. Demonstration projects implemented by DW with advice from\u000d\u000a        CEHS in the province of\u000d\u000a        Huambo have introduced real changes in [the] practice of land\u000d\u000a        management. The municipal\u000d\u000a        administration of Huambo has developed a set of administrative\u000d\u000a        procedures based on the principle\u000d\u000a        of incremental land tenure improvement [and] introduced\u000d\u000a        \"occupation licences\" that provide\u000d\u000a        families with security of tenure and allow them the time to obtain full\u000d\u000a        titles.\"\u000d\u000a    The Alliance's CEHS has been described by Huambo's [text removed for\u000d\u000a      publication] Urbanism,\u000d\u000a      Planning and Environment as \"important partners for the Municipal\u000d\u000a        Administration.

Impacts include\u000d\u000a      DW being awarded funding from\u000d\u000a      the United States Agency for International Development to prepare a Draft\u000d\u000a      Operations Manual on\u000d\u000a      land rights, published in May 2008 as the Formalization of Land Rights\u000d\u000a        in Rural and Peri Urban\u000d\u000a        Settings in Angola. In addition, Dutch Embassy funding (2007 to\u000d\u000a      present) has enabled DW to\u000d\u000a      replicate the experience in other provinces, leading to: the development\u000d\u000a      of a manual which is now\u000d\u000a      in its 3rd edition (2011) and has been used for training several hundred\u000d\u000a      government staff in Bie,\u000d\u000a      Huambo and Benguela and at the National Training Institute for Local\u000d\u000a      Administration; the creation\u000d\u000a      of a 2,000+ item, virtual library on urban land issues in Angola (www.bibliotecaterra.angonet.org);\u000aand\u000d\u000a      the piloting of purpose-designed (open source) cadastral software to\u000d\u000a      better facilitate land use\u000d\u000a      control by local government.\u000d\u000a    Because they offer opportunities for a planned alternative to peri-urban\u000d\u000a      sprawl, urban expansion\u000d\u000a      plans have attracted private sector development. Strategic planning work\u000d\u000a      for DW by the Alliance\u000d\u000a      (through CEHS) in Edinburgh in 2010 directly stimulated the `spin off' of\u000d\u000a      successful new private\u000d\u000a      sector enterprises, for example, Pafil Ltd and Navimbuando Ltd, the latter\u000d\u000a      now the only local\u000d\u000a      company in central Angola offering services inclusive of topographic\u000d\u000a      survey, the design of new\u000d\u000a      urban layouts and the demarcation of plots. As well as operating\u000d\u000a      commercially, these companies\u000d\u000a      also work for provincial and local authorities in new urban development,\u000d\u000a      land use management and\u000d\u000a      infrastructure provision. As a result of these activities, urban\u000d\u000a      residents, newly empowered by land\u000d\u000a      rights, feel more secure in their homes and are more likely to invest,\u000d\u000a      both economically and\u000d\u000a      emotionally, in their properties and wider neighbourhoods.\u000d\u000a    Although the planned upgrading of existing neighbourhoods is more of a\u000d\u000a      challenge, it remains a\u000d\u000a      priority, including for local government. In June 2013, Jenkins and Smith\u000d\u000a      were invited by Huambo\u000d\u000a      City Administration to assist in devising a strategic action plan for\u000d\u000a      urban development, including the\u000d\u000a      recognition of land rights for existing residents. Previously, in 2012,\u000d\u000a      Jenkins had assisted DW plan\u000d\u000a      scaling-up urban land projects to programme level, with the local\u000d\u000a      authority requesting strategic\u000d\u000a      planning assistance. In addition, at national level, in September 2011,\u000d\u000a      Jenkins was invited as one\u000d\u000a      of only five international experts to contribute to a workshop organised\u000d\u000a      by the United Nations, local\u000d\u000a      NGO, HABITAT Angola, and the Angolan Government on formulating urban\u000d\u000a      development strategy,\u000d\u000a      leading [text removed for publication] HABITAT Angola (see 5.4) to write:\u000d\u000a      \"Prof. Jenkins brings a lot of practical experience from Mozambique and\u000d\u000a        Brazil, which are\u000d\u000a        important countries for Angola to learn from.

The [text\u000d\u000a      removed for publication]\u000d\u000a      World Bank's ProMaputo II Programme has said of the research:\u000d\u000a      \"I think it represents a milestone in the field of informal settlements\u000d\u000a        studies in Maputo and the wider\u000d\u000a        African context, ...

Heightened\u000d\u000a      interest in the research has led to requests for Jenkins to speak at, for\u000d\u000a      example, the Planning\u000d\u000a      Africa Conference (in Durban, September 2012, as the ending keynote\u000d\u000a      speaker) and as part of the\u000d\u000a      Future of Cities Distinguished Lecture Series (run by the Oxford\u000d\u000a      University Sustainable Urban\u000d\u000a      development programme) in June 2013.\u000d\u000a    Public awareness of the work has been widened through the 2012\u000d\u000a      documentary African Urban\u000d\u000a        Dreams.

For this to happen at scale, it is essential to understand\u000d\u000a      and work with the so-called\u000d\u000a      `informal' land supply mechanisms developed by residents and other\u000d\u000a      stakeholders, embedding this\u000d\u000a      in evolving regulatory capacity at local government level (e.g. through\u000d\u000a      new approaches to urban\u000d\u000a      planning and housing).\u000d\u000a    At present, no other UK HEI is working on research of this nature in\u000d\u000a      Lusophone Africa (in terms of\u000d\u000a      depth, longitudinal scope and sustained impact) and the work has\u000d\u000a      positioned Jenkins, in particular,\u000d\u000a      as a leader in the field (leading to, for example, his contribution to a\u000d\u000a      UN-funded scoping study on\u000d\u000a      urban land issues in Angola and invitations to present at the\u000d\u000a      London-Angola conference in\u000d\u000a      Chatham House and a UN\/Government sponsored seminar in Luanda).\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the Alliance\u000d\u000a      has developed capacity within Africa, specifically Angola, where formerly,\u000d\u000a      as HABITAT Angola has\u000d\u000a      stated, \"nobody had any real appreciation of the urban challenges in\u000d\u000a        this country\". A number of the\u000d\u000a      research projects have involved close collaboration between Jenkins, Smith\u000d\u000a      and the Angolan-based\u000d\u000a      NGO, Development Workshop (DW), e.g. research undertaken over the period\u000d\u000a      2002-4,\u000d\u000a      funded by the Department for International Development (DfID), which has\u000d\u000a      been a key pathway to\u000d\u000a      impact. In 2013, the Alliance also worked directly with the Huambo\u000d\u000a      Municipal Administration on\u000d\u000a      action-research to develop a strategy for the sustainable urban\u000d\u000a      development of the city.\u000d\u000a    Significant outputs from the research include in-situ training courses,\u000d\u000a      which have been devised and\u000d\u000a      conducted for DW by the Alliance. In 2004, one such course addressed urban\u000d\u000a      land and housing\u000d\u000a      development strategies\/practice for central, provincial and local\u000d\u000a      government, the private sector and\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations. It led to a number of pilot projects in\u000d\u000a      Huambo (a key Angolan\u000d\u000a      secondary urban area) and, over the following two years, Alliance training\u000d\u000a      inputs were also\u000d\u000a      provided to DW as the basis for a further study on informal rented housing\u000d\u000a      in Angola. This work\u000d\u000a      was funded by the International Development Research Centre of Canada and\u000d\u000a      published in 2008.\u000d\u000a    Over the thirteen years of action-research, activity in Angola has\u000d\u000a      overlapped with work in\u000d\u000a      Mozambique. From 2009-2012, this was principally conducted as part of a\u000d\u000a      large, international\u000d\u000a      multi-disciplinary research programme on urban land and housing issues\u000d\u000a      called Home Space in\u000d\u000a      the African City. The research involved collaboration with Danish,\u000d\u000a      Portuguese and Mozambican\u000d\u000a      Universities, funded by the Danish Council for Independent Research.\u000d\u000a      Jenkins designed the overall\u000d\u000a      programme for the study, which incorporated unique longitudinal data from\u000d\u000a      his two tranches of\u000d\u000a      prior research in Maputo (including UN work in 1990), and was the\u000d\u000a      project's Work Leader for\u000d\u000a      Quality Control, Context and Synthesis.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23958","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The UK Government spends substantial public funds on new affordable and\u000a      social housing each year (&#163;10bn in 2008-10; 70,000 new affordable housing\u000a      units). Depending on where and how this money is invested, it can benefit\u000a      the c.1.6m households in need, including the c.90,000 households accepted\u000a      as homeless annually (Bramley et al, 2010). If misdirected, however, it\u000a      may be wasted in oversupplied markets. Alliance research by Bramley and\u000a      his group has significantly influenced the allocation of resources for\u000a      affordable housing in England and Scotland between geographical areas,\u000a      types of provision and client, and over time in relation to the market.\u000a    Impact over the period 2008-2013 builds on Bramley's participation in a\u000a      Policy Action Team on Unpopular Housing (1998-2000), led by the (then)\u000a      Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. This alerted\u000a      authorities to the dangers of oversupply in low demand areas and the need\u000a      to modify housing allocation therein. The [text removed for publication]\u000a      Department for Communities and Local Government has said \"the complex\u000a      research delivered important and robust evidence on the scale, causes and\u000a      consequences of unpopular\/low demand housing. It informed policy\u000a      development at the time, and it is encouraging to see how it continues to\u000a      play an important role in the ongoing evidence base around housing supply\u000a      and need.\"\u000a    Another crucial milestone on the pathway to current impact was the\u000a      citation of the team's work, multiple times, in [text removed for\u000a      publication] (2004) Review of Housing Supply (see 5.1, below). This raised\u000a      awareness of the scale of affordable housing need in pressured regions,\u000a      particularly the south of England and Southeast Scotland. Since then, the\u000a      team's published outputs and modelling tools have assisted the Housing\u000a      Corporation (now the Homes and Communities Agency) in England and the\u000a      Scottish Government in reviewing their regional allocation processes, and\u000a      have been used by the Department for Communities and Local Government\u000a      (DCLG) to assess policy options in the context of the 2010 Government\u000a      Spending Review. Overall, the research has significantly contributed to a\u000a      shift of emphasis in public investment and planning from declining urban\u000a      regions to higher demand growth regions, from a 46% \/ 54% split in 1995 to\u000a      a 20% \/ 80% in 2007 and a 32% \/ 68% split in 2009\/10 (English regions).\u000a    Writing about Bramley's work (see 5.2), [text removed for publication]\u000a      the DCLG has said... \"Glen was our first choice to lead work on the\u000a      development of a Housing Needs model. This was invaluable to the\u000a      Department in making the case for affordable housing in a tough Spending\u000a      Review process (2010). [The] work also helped to influence the development\u000a      of our innovative Affordable Rents model and supported the accompanying\u000a      Impact Assessment. We are once again drawing on [it] for the current\u000a      Spending Round to inform modelling assumptions, including evidence on\u000a      additionality of affordable housing.\"\u000a    The Model used by DCLG in the 2010 Government Spending Review was highly\u000a      admired by the Housing New Zealand Corporation. This led to Bramley and\u000a      Leishman, with Research Assistant David Watkins, developing a Demand and\u000a      Supply Forecasting model for New Zealand. The results are now in active\u000a      use informing the 10-year re-investment programme of the state housing\u000a      agency in assets valued at $15bn. The Agency [text removed for\u000a      publication] has described how the work \"represents a quantum leap forward\u000a      in our ability to forecast demand for state housing\". (See 5.3).\u000a    In a consultancy-led review for a regional body, the team's West of\u000a      England SHMA (Strategic Housing Market Assessment) of 2009 was the most\u000a      commended of its kind in the South West region. [text removed for\u000a      publication] Bristol City Council has confirmed that... \"Professor Glen\u000a      Bramley's work has been judged to be sound and rigorous and has been very\u000a      significant in ensuring that Bristol has an adopted Core Strategy, as well\u000a      as solid guidance for agreeing affordable housing contributions by\u000a      developers\". (See 5.4). In Scotland, the Highland Council SHNDA (Housing\u000a      Need and Demand Assessment) was the first to be certified as Robust and\u000a      Credible by the Scottish Government. At local level, the\u000a      affordability-based approach to needs assessment has been promoted in\u000a      official guidance by the UK national and devolved governments. Much of\u000a      this guidance, including the SHMA Guidance in England (2007) and the\u000a      Housing Need and Demand Assessment Guidance for Local Authorities in\u000a      Scotland (2008), has been based, in part, on advice given, and\u000a      publications authored by, the Alliance team.\u000a    Most recently, the [text removed for publication] Scottish Government's\u000a      Centre for Housing Market Analysis has confirmed that \"The Bramley-Watkins\u000a      study for The Highland Council (THC) was the basis for the development of\u000a      our Housing Need and Demand Toolkit. This provides a robust but\u000a      straightforward platform for planning authorities to conduct required\u000a      housing analysis\". (See 5.5). The toolkit embodies economic forecasts for\u000a      prices and other variables derived from Leishman et al's 2008 model of\u000a      housing supply and affordability. He goes on to say that our work, in\u000a      particular for THC, was \"crucial to the development of the mechanism for\u000a      the allocation of social housing funding in Scotland that was agreed\u000a      between local and central government in late 2012\".\u000a    Consultants providing analytical services to local authorities in England\u000a      now provide assessment tools based on `Bramley' model-types as a\u000a      commercial service. One example is B. Line Housing Information Ltd. This\u000a      consultancy undertakes Strategic Housing Market Assessments for groups of\u000a      local authorities. On its website, B. Line promotes the fact that \"The\u000a      affordability model featured in our work on Strategic Housing Market\u000a      Assessments is derived from the Bramley Model\" (see 5.6).\u000a    More rigorous local assessments are critical to the effective use of\u000a      planning powers to facilitate affordable housing provision. For example,\u000a      in public spending terms, Section 106\/75 agreements are more\u000a      cost-effective delivery mechanisms than traditional public procurement and\u000a      funding streams. The Alliance research has enhanced the ability of\u000a      national government to underpin the stronger use of planning powers to\u000a      deliver affordable housing, worth &#163;2.6bn in subsidy from land value in\u000a      2007-08, up from &#163;1.2bn in 2003 and negligible ten years earlier, as shown\u000a      in DCLG evaluation research. In a report for Scottish Government in 2010,\u000a      the team demonstrated the extent of enhanced capacity for housebuilding\u000a      achievable with effective use of planning agreements in areas of high need\u000a      and high residual land values.\u000a    Although Bramley's contribution to the Government's Low Cost Home\u000a      Ownership Task Force concluded in 2003, its impact has extended into the\u000a      period 2008-2013. Along with subsequent research for a range of bodies\u000a      into the scale of need and demand for `intermediate housing' &#8212; such as\u000a      shared ownership &#8212; and ways of financing it, it has led to an expansion\u000a      and better targeting of this sector. In England, the share of\u000a      `intermediate' in all affordable housing rose for 13% in 1991 and 19% in\u000a      2001 to 43% in 2008-10. Evidence of the international impact of this\u000a      strand of research is provided by the [text removed for publication]\u000a      Housing Agency, Ireland, who has said \"The outcome of the work [was]\u000a      inclusion in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 of Part V\u000a      &#8212;Affordable Dwellings Purchase Arrangements, Sections 78 to 96. This\u000a      allows for equity loan arrangements which were the final outcome of the\u000a      studies. Due [to] the economic situation this part of the Act has not been\u000a      commenced...However, the principles of the equity loan have been used in a\u000a      different way as part of the main approach to the current methods of\u000a      delivery of social housing... and also in a mortgage-to-rent scheme...\u000a      What we have learned from you has had a significant impact and has helped\u000a      in dealing with our current economic circumstances.\" (See 5.7).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Alliance research has been used by the UK and Scottish governments to\u000a      direct more of the &#163;10bn p.a. public investment in affordable and social\u000a      housing towards higher demand growth regions. It has produced a range of\u000a      affordability-based housing needs models which have been commended as\u000a      exemplars of good practice guidance for local authorities and adopted by\u000a      industry consultancies.

However, problems of\u000a      oversupply in low demand areas suggest that these approaches are\u000a      inadequate for providing a realistic picture of need. As reported in a\u000a      number of leading academic journals, including Urban Studies, housing\u000a      researchers at Heriot-Watt University have developed a range of\u000a      affordability-based models for more consistently analysing the demand and\u000a      need for different kinds of housing in different geographical areas.\u000a      Through using improved secondary data, this negates the need for separate\u000a      surveys, which tend to be less robust and more expensive.\u000a    The research programme has been ongoing since 1998. The team includes\u000a      Prof Glen Bramley (1994-present), Prof Chris Leishman (1999-2006;\u000a      2012-present) and Prof Hal Pawson (1995-2012). Innovations include the\u000a      development of synthetic modelling of local income distributions, which\u000a      has enabled the researchers to estimate affordability rates governing\u000a      access to the housing market at the most relevant geographical scale. It\u000a      has also allowed them to determine the need for additional affordable\u000a      provision, by linking income distribution to demographic and re-let supply\u000a      flows, and, in more recent work, to housing market forecasting models.\u000a    The modelling has proved to be an effective predictor of the incidence of\u000a      problems of low demand for social housing. It has also demonstrated that\u000a      it is possible to obtain reasonable, consistent measures of need for new\u000a      provision across a large number of areas using secondary data sources.\u000a      Repeated studies in Scotland have proven the reliability of synthetic\u000a      income estimates, the relationship between modelled needs and needs\u000a      generated from local surveys, the sensitivity of results to geographical\u000a      market area boundaries, the relationship with homelessness and the factors\u000a      driving other elements of assessment, including household formation and\u000a      social housing re-lets. Studies in the West of England and Highlands have\u000a      demonstrated the feasibility of more localised applications of the core\u000a      tool.\u000a    The research has also involved evaluating the cost-effectiveness of\u000a      publicly-subsidised, low cost home ownership schemes. Studies have been\u000a      commissioned by the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the\u000a      Regions and by the Irish Affordable Homes Partnership, among others.\u000a      Further tools for using secondary data have been developed for a component\u000a      indicator in the UK Indices of Multiple Deprivation and in research for\u000a      the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit. In 2008, Leishman led the\u000a      development for the Scottish Government of an economic model to predict\u000a      incomes, prices and affordability across sub-regions of Scotland, outputs\u000a      of which are currently being used to assess local authority need\u000a      assessments.\u000a    In 2008-10, Bramley led a major study for the Department for Communities\u000a      and Local Government (DCLG). This was to develop a new national \/ regional\u000a      model to predict housing need outcomes in England conditional on forecast\u000a      demographic, economic and housing market conditions and policies for\u000a      housing supply and allocation. The model shows how, and to what extent,\u000a      affordability affects other housing needs. International interest in the\u000a      work has led to Bramley and Leishman developing a Demand and Supply\u000a      Forecasting model for New Zealand.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23959","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    With estimates of a 70% increase in the number of people in the EU aged\u000a      65 or over by 2050, the needs and challenges of an ageing population are\u000a      of increasing importance to all tiers of government and the private and\u000a      charity sectors. Inclusive Design for Getting Outdoors (I'DGO) has engaged\u000a      and impacted on a diverse range of users across all these sectors,\u000a      primarily through its pool of non-academic partners totalling 37\u000a      organisations and two independent consultants. One partner, a transport\u000a      planner, has said \"the project has been very useful in opening up\u000a        dialogue [and] encouraging debate in a wide range of policy areas;\u000a        planning, design, transport and health and [engendering] a better\u000a        understanding of how they all fit together\". One example is Ward\u000a      Thompson's contribution, by invitation, to a Public Health Workshop on\u000a      Physical Activity by the Department of Health's Chief Medical Officer in\u000a      2012 during which she briefed multiple policy teams in Westminster on\u000a      I'DGO research findings.\u000a    In its guide to age-friendly placemaking, Lifetime Neighbourhoods\u000a      (2011; see 5.1, below), the Department for Communities and Local\u000a      Government (DCLG) describes I'DGO as \"a very significant source of\u000a        research and guidance\". It suggests that local government and\u000a      resident-led groups should regularly check the I'DGO website for new\u000a      evidence and describes the Alliance work on green space, in particular, as\u000a      a \"seminal\" part of an evidence base which \"has led to valuable\u000a        developments in terms of links between health commissioning and planning\".\u000a      The free I'DGO guidance it cites, on open space and street design, is one\u000a      of only two such sources referenced in the World Health Organization's Global\u000a        Age-Friendly Cities: A Guide (2007; see 5.2). Impact arising from\u000a      this includes in-depth collaboration with strategists developing the WHO\u000a      age-friendly cities of Edinburgh and Manchester, the provision of advice\u000a      to the Cabinet Office of Japan on its FutureCity initiative\u000a      (2012-2013; see 5.3) and work with the EU-funded SaMERU &#8212; Safer Mobility\u000a      for Elderly Road Users project (including citation in its Final Technical\u000a      Report).\u000a    Like DCLG, the Scottish Government has been a highly proactive partner in\u000a      I'DGO research. In the last three years, it has asked for, and reflected,\u000a      I'DGO evidence and opinion in two policies in particular. In Designing\u000a        Streets: A Policy Statement for Scotland (2010; see 5.4), we\u000a      specifically asked that the Government make clear that streets are of\u000a      benefit as destinations in their own right. The published policy states\u000a      that \"Scotland's best streets provide some of the most valuable social\u000a        spaces that we possess\" and asks for planners to recognise that \"Pedestrians\u000a        may be walking with purpose or engaging in other activities such as\u000a        play, socialising, shopping or just sitting\".\u000a    When preparing its new policy on architecture and placemaking for\u000a      Scotland, the Government again invited I'DGO to contribute. In our\u000a      response, we stressed that inclusive design could promote integration and\u000a      coordination between polices covering the built environment, health and\u000a      social care and economic growth (see 5.5). This is emphasised in the final\u000a      Policy, published in June 2013 as Creating Places, where the\u000a      Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs writes, \"In a\u000a        challenging economic climate, we should not question whether we can\u000a        afford to deliver good design. Instead, we should ask, can we afford not\u000a        to? Whether it is by supporting active, healthy lifestyles, or reducing\u000a        our carbon footprint, or being the critical factor which attracts\u000a        visitors and inward investment, the value of place cannot be\u000a        underestimated or ignored\". In addition, Ward Thompson was invited\u000a      to share I'DGO research during a targeted consultation on inclusive access\u000a      as part of this Policy's development phase and has since been invited to\u000a      join the group developing the Government's Scottish National Walking\u000a      Strategy (2013).\u000a    In October 2009, I'DGO was invited to participate in the pan-European\u000a      AENEAS (Attaining Energy-Efficient Mobility in an Ageing Society) project,\u000a      established under the Intelligent Energy Europe programme. Given at a\u000a      training workshop on Walking and Traffic Safety in an Ageing Society\u000a      in Donostia-San Sebasti&#225;n, Spain, Ward Thompson's I'DGO presentation was\u000a      rated the \"best and most useful\" of 41 presentations given over\u000a      five CPD events for public and private sector stakeholders in urban\u000a      mobility across Europe (see 5.6). Worldwide, I'DGO findings have been used\u000a      in training for over 1,000 professionals and, in the UK alone, for over\u000a      500 planners and highways engineers in six British cities as part of the\u000a      2010 national and regional roll-out of Manual for Streets 2: Wider\u000a        Application of the Principles by the Chartered Institution of\u000a      Highways &amp; Transportation (CIHT) and the UK Department for Transport\u000a      (DfT). The consortium has since been approached by CIHT to review Transport\u000a        in the Urban Environment, its comprehensive guide to the design and\u000a      management of urban road networks.\u000a    At grassroots level, I'DGO's approach has always been to empower and\u000a      enable older people to create impact on their own terms. The consortium\u000a      has been proactive in the Age Scotland campaign Walk in our Shoes; Act\u000a        on our Issues and promoted by Age UK in its Pride of Place\u000a      campaign, targeting local authority councillors and officers. Engagement\u000a      with the City of Edinburgh's Council's City for All Ages Advisory\u000a      Group has included an I'DGO-hosted public event opened by the Lord Provost\u000a      of Aberdeen at the British Science Festival in September 2012, when an\u000a      82-year old Edinburgh resident debated age-friendly placemaking with\u000a      speakers from Age Scotland, Anderson Bell Christie Architects and a former\u000a      MSP. The work has also helped to highlight older people's issues in the\u000a      media, including in The Herald newspaper, May 2012.\u000a    I'DGO is a case study in Making the Case for the Social Sciences:\u000a        Ageing (see 5.7), published by the British Society of Gerontology,\u000a      the Academy of Social Sciences and AgeUK. The report was launched in\u000a      Westminster in July 2010 at a ministerial Q&amp;A led by [text removed for\u000a      publication], who, two years later, gave the opening address at the\u000a      presentation of the I'DGO TOO findings in the Headquarters of the European\u000a      Commission in the UK (see 5.8). Seven elected members across the four UK\u000a      governments have publically supported I'DGO's work, with the Scottish\u000a      [text removed for publication] for Health, Wellbeing and Cities saying \"The\u000a        findings are an important touchstone for those of us in policy\u000a        development, bringing real benefits to Scotland's growing number of\u000a        people aged 65+\" (see 5.9). In 2013, the consortium hosted fringe\u000a      receptions and panel events at both the Plaid Cymru Spring Conference in\u000a      Wales and the Local Government Association annual conference in\u000a      Manchester, blogging by invitation on the LGA conference website and in\u000a      its FirstOnline magazine.\u000a    I'DGO was a runner up in the International Design for all Foundation\u000a      Awards 2013, with one judge commenting \"...there is a lot that others\u000a        can learn from their approach\". Our findings were used during the\u000a      development of FUTURAGE, Europe's new road map for ageing research; [text\u000a      removed for publication] Age UK [text removed for publication] described\u000a      them as part of an evidence base on mobility, access and the design of the\u000a      external environment which was \"crucial to the development of the\u000a        research questions formulated in Chapter Two, Ageing Well at Home and in\u000a        Community Environments\". After Ward Thompson was invited to present\u000a      I'DGO findings at the Toward an age-friendly EU by 2020 conference\u000a      in Brussels (May 2013), [text removed for publication] AGE Platform Europe\u000a      wrote \"Your visions and innovative solutions will help us to draw\u000a        recommendations on how to create\/ adapt spatial environments to the\u000a        specific needs of our ageing populations [and] ... pursue our campaign\u000a        to create age-friendly environments across the EU\" (see 5.10).\u000a      Drawing on I'DGO, and its promotion through KT-EQUAL, Ward Thompson has\u000a      also advised on the environmental implications of research funded by the\u000a      Canadian Institute for Health Research as part of the City of Vancouver's\u000a      Walk the Talk initiative.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    By 2050, there will be 2 billion people in the world aged 60 or over.\u000a      Award-winning research has provided new evidence that maintaining health\u000a      and mobility in this ageing population is related to easy and enjoyable\u000a      access to outdoor environments.

However, until 2003, when the Inclusive Design for Getting\u000a      Outdoors (I'DGO) project was established, little research had explored the\u000a      relationship between good outdoor access for older people and healthier,\u000a      more independent, active living into oldest age. This Engineering and\u000a      Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded study provided the first\u000a      empirically robust UK evidence of the impacts on older people's health and\u000a      wellbeing of restricting access to outdoor environments. In 2006, the\u000a      consortium delivering the project was awarded further EPSRC funding to\u000a      carry out a second phase of research and, in 2009, the Director, Catharine\u000a      Ward Thompson, became a Co-Investigator of the EPSRC's knowledge transfer\u000a      consortium on ageing, KT-EQUAL.\u000a    The I'DGO consortium consisted of Alliance researchers, together with\u000a      colleagues at the Universities of Salford and Oxford Brookes. The\u000a      Principal Investigator and Consortium Director for the first project,\u000a      I'DGO 1, was Prof Catharine Ward Thompson (1981-present), Director of the\u000a      OPENspace research centre, with Prof Peter Aspinall (1974 &#8212; present), as\u000a      Co-Investigator and Dr Takemi Sugiyama (2003-2006) and Dr Susana Alves\u000a      (2006-2011) as Research Associates. For the second phase, I'DGO TOO, Ward\u000a      Thompson remained as Director, Aspinall as Co-Investigator and Alves as\u000a      Research Associate (until June 2011), joined by Prof Archie Young\u000a      (Geriatric Medicine 1998-2007, now Emeritus Professor) as Co-Investigator.\u000a      Academic partners were as before, although the Oxford Brookes team moved\u000a      to the University of Warwick mid-2009.\u000a    The I'DGO research led by the Alliance team provided statistically sound\u000a      evidence on characteristics of neighbourhood open space and access to it\u000a      that were associated with healthy levels of physical activity,\u000a      particularly walking, in older people. It demonstrated what aspects of\u000a      environmental design support walking for leisure and pleasure as opposed\u000a      to walking for transport &#8212; a key distinction for understanding physical\u000a      activity in old age. It indicated what qualities of the local environment\u000a      predict whether older people achieve recommended healthy levels of\u000a      physical activity and what aspects are associated with life satisfaction\u000a      or quality of life, as opposed to physical activity. Such findings have\u000a      provided evidence of direct relevance to government indicators of health\u000a      and wellbeing in our ageing society.\u000a    I'DGO's mixed methods approach included questionnaire surveys, focus\u000a      groups, activity diaries and monitoring, literature reviews, street audits\u000a      and behavioural observations. In the first phase, Alliance researchers\u000a      surveyed older people about their wellbeing and quality of life, how often\u000a      and why they went outdoors and what features of their local neighbourhood\u000a      helped or hindered their activity. Among other insights the research found\u000a      that, if older participants lived in a `supportive' environment (e.g. with\u000a      good quality and attractive footpaths to their local open space, ideally\u000a      within 10 minutes' walk), they were twice as likely to achieve recommended\u000a      levels of physical activity &#8212; 2.5 hours walking per week.\u000a    The second phase of research, I'DGO TOO, focused on specific aspects of\u000a      placemaking which were gaining currency in policy and practice but which\u000a      had not yet been tested for age-friendliness. In particular, Alliance\u000a      researchers focused on interventions to make residential streets more\u000a      pedestrian-friendly, asking if such environmental changes affected the\u000a      social and physical activity patterns of older residents. The study found\u000a      that, while measures to make nearby streets less car-centric improved\u000a      older people's perception of usability and safety, such changes did not\u000a      have as much impact on wellbeing, social engagement and quality of life as\u000a      environmental factors on a wider, neighbourhood scale, such as accessible\u000a      open space. The I'DGO TOO findings were reported in Europe House in April\u000a      2012, in the parliaments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in May\u000a      2012 and in the European Parliament, Brussels, in March 2013.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24530","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Institute has had a good impact upon, and brought a range of benefits\u000a      to, the wider community by influencing government policy, stimulating\u000a      debate with research evidence, improving public understanding of urban\u000a      issues and challenging some of the conventional wisdom about cities.\u000a    EIUA has achieved impact by bridging the worlds of research and decision\u000a      makers and influencers; setting national and local policy agendas; making\u000a      its work publicly accessible through conferences and the media nationally\u000a      and internationally; promoting good practice at local, national and\u000a      European level. Owing to the quality of our research, our Director was\u000a      appointed member of the Ministerial Urban Sounding Board designed to give\u000a      personal, policy advice to the Minister for Local Government in the period\u000a      2004-7. He was also invited to lead the government's network of research\u000a      advisers on cities for the Department of Communities and Local Government\u000a      between 2007-10. Both drew on academics and consultants to provide\u000a      independent evidence and analysis of key issues for government urban\u000a      policy about urban economic competitiveness, social exclusion and\u000a      successful governance. In both instances this enabled EIUA research\u000a      findings to influence the development of government policy in those and\u000a      following years and led to sustained investment in the kinds of integrated\u000a      urban regeneration programmes advocated by us. Our Director was also\u000a      appointed Specialist Adviser in 2012 to the House of Commons Select\u000a      Committee which inquired into the UK government's policies for\u000a      regeneration and shaped the well-received but challenging critique of its\u000a      regeneration policies arguing the need to go beyond ad hoc localism to a\u000a      more strategic approach to regeneration.\u000a    The State of English cities report was the basis for much of the urban\u000a      policy that emerged from government in the second part of the decade such\u000a      as Local Strategic Partnerships, Local and Multi-Area Agreements and City\u000a      Regional Pilots and the new emphasis on place quality. It remains the\u000a      authoritative guide to the performance of UK cities and is widely cited\u000a      and used by academics and policymakers. It produced a novel, more accurate\u000a      way of defining towns and cities' spatial extent &#8212; primary urban areas\u000a      (PUAs) &#8212; which has since been widely used. (e.g. in the Centre for Cities\u000a      think tank's many publications).\u000a    The Compete research encouraged the government to view cities as vital\u000a      sources of national economic competitiveness, highlighted the importance\u000a      of involving higher education institutions in urban growth policies and\u000a      facilitated greater networking between English and European cities.\u000a\u0009The\u000a      two credit crunch reports generated extensive debate amongst policy makers\u000a      and parliamentarians and received widespread publicity in national\u000a      conferences and the quality press including the Financial Times which\u000a      focused the public debate about the future of urban regeneration in this\u000a      country. Both reports argued for continued investment as a requirement to\u000a      secure previous investment which the then Government accepted and took on\u000a      board. This led to instances where the Government, via for example the\u000a      Homes and Communities Agency, injected further investment to sustain\u000a      stalled urban regeneration schemes in 2009 and 2010. The CLG report in\u000a      particular has been highly cited by academics and policymakers.\u000a    The main arguments of our Second Tier Cities in Europe' report about\u000a      decentralisation in decision making and deconcentration of public\u000a      investment have already been reproduced in a series of policy oriented\u000a      reports by national and international think tanks. The recent 5th Cohesion\u000a      Report of the European Commission published in 2010 drew upon its evidence\u000a      and analysis about the performance of cities in Europe. Drawing upon its\u000a      second tier cities research, the Institute did analytical work during 2011\u000a      for the Deputy Prime Minister and Cabinet Office which underpins the\u000a      current government's new urban programme `Unlocking Growth in Cities'.\u000a      Both the Cabinet Office and Core Cities group have agreed that our `Second\u000a      Tier Cities in Europe' report directly influenced the principles and\u000a      policies of the current government through the City Deals initiative\u000a      launched in December 2011 and extended in February 2013. These involve a\u000a      major shift in national policy with greater delegation of powers to local\u000a      government and new models of public sector investment. They apply to 28\u000a      major English cities &#8212; the twenty two largest and the six most rapidly\u000a      growing with a combined population of about 18m. The Chancellor of the\u000a      Exchequer and Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills in\u000a      their official response to the Heseltine Review accepted many of his\u000a      recommendations, specifically arguing that the evidence in the Institute's\u000a      Second Tier Cities report demonstrated that such policies had allowed many\u000a      European countries to become more competitive than the UK.\u000a    We believe that the influence and impact of our work is demonstrated by\u000a      the reception it has received from senior figures in the policy making and\u000a      research community and the way in which its arguments, evidence and\u000a      analysis have influenced policy decisions by those key figures.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The European Institute for Urban Affairs' (EIUA) evidence, analyses and\u000a      advocacy have shaped urban policies and decisively influenced policy\u000a      makers in its city region, the UK and Europe.

Its work has ensured that these themes have entered the language\u000a      of policy makers and influenced the development of new policy initiatives,\u000a      nationally and internationally. This is evidenced in five major pieces of\u000a      work which have advanced these themes and shaped the development of policy\u000a      during the past decade.\u000a    Our research projects have been led by the Director Professor Michael\u000a      Parkinson, Professors Richard Evans and Richard Meegan, but have involved\u000a      Gerwyn Jones (Senior Research Fellow) and Jay Karecha (Research Fellow).\u000a    2.1. State of English Cities ODPM 2006\u000a      This work for the Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for the\u000a      Environment was the largest review of city performance and policy ever\u000a      undertaken by the UK government. The Institute led over 50 researchers\u000a      from 9 research organisations which involved: creating a new national\u000a      extensive database of urban performance with 64 quantitative indicators\u000a      over 3 decades for 56 Primary Urban Areas covering 58% of the English\u000a      population; assessing the impact of a range of national urban policies;\u000a      identifying good practice studies of a range of UK cities; and comparative\u000a      quantitative analysis of European cities. The report [1] identified the\u000a      impact of national policies upon cities and the need for continued\u000a      government investment and leadership, learning from success abroad to\u000a      rebalance the UK economy. It has also shaped subsequent Government policy\u000a      (see section 4).\u000a    2.2. COMPETE European Commission 2007\u000a      We initiated and led the COMPETE network a three year programme funded by\u000a      UK government and the European Commission for the exchange of policies and\u000a      practices between the UK's eight Core Cities and seven leading successful\u000a      second tier cities across Europe. We helped over 100 policy makers from\u000a      those cities to work together to develop new ways of addressing common\u000a      problems, such as developing resilient and effective public private\u000a      partnerships, in particular the triple helix model and devolving more\u000a      decision making to cities. Government accepted and agreed to develop the\u000a      key policy messages (see section 4) [2].\u000a    2.3. Credit Crunch Communities and Local Government (CLG) and Northern\u000a        Way 2009-10\u000a      The impact of the credit crunch upon urban areas and regeneration in the\u000a      UK was assessed in two reports [3,4]. The first, commissioned by CLG\u000a      Minister John Healey in 2009, demonstrated the risks to previous\u000a      investment, people and places and identified ways in which government\u000a      could and should save many regeneration projects. The second, conducted\u000a      for the Northern Way in 2010, updated the analysis and showed that the\u000a      recession was hitting northern towns and cities particularly hard. It\u000a      highlighted that larger cities were faring better than smaller and more\u000a      peripheral towns in addition to innovative ways of ensuring continuation\u000a      of regeneration projects. These reports have influenced Government\u000a      investment decisions (see section 4).\u000a    2.4. Second Tier Cities European Commission 2012\u000a      The economic performance and prospects of 155 cities in 31 European\u000a      countries during the recession were assessed in a major report [5]. It\u000a      developed a major European quantitative data base and analyses of 9 major\u000a      cities thus identifying the need for policy changes in the UK. It provided\u000a      major new quantitative evidence that deconcentration of investment and\u000a      decentralisation of decision making leads to reduced regional inequality\u000a      and improved national economic performance.

Furthermore,\u000a      during the collaboration with Longma in 2011 it was found that the\u000a      microwave system can process a broader range of highly degraded bio-oil\u000a      feedstock than conventional systems, resulting in less waste. The\u000a      technology is currently under assessment by an investment group of venture\u000a      capitalists in the West Midlands, known as Green Frog in collaboration\u000a      with Longma, who have raised &#163;15m to build various industrial systems\u000a      (&#163;10M) including LJMU research technology (&#163;5M) at their plant in Hull. It\u000a      is planned that the completed systems to be exported around the world and\u000a      could potentially benefit everyone from householders and businesses who\u000a      could sell their used oil products for conversion to biodiesel, to farmers\u000a      in remote areas who could make their own precious fuel at a fraction of\u000a      the cost.\u000a    Biofuel Wales Ltd\u000a      The Director of Biofuel Wales Ltd and partner in the &#8364;1.05M EU FP7\u000a      MICROGRASS project said: \"The microwave technology developments meet a key\u000a      technological need in the European SME bio-fuel sector and provides SMEs\u000a      farmers with a use for their, at present, non-profitable infertile land\".\u000a      Prior to the development of the microwave system as part of the MICROGRASS\u000a      project the only available method (i.e. steam explosion) to break down\u000a      cellulosic biomass (e.g. lignin), was incredibly energy intensive. Thus,\u000a      the MICROGRASS project has provided an effective, low energy technology\u000a      for bioethanol production which could allow the EU to satisfy the growing\u000a      demand for biofuels. Furthermore, it provides this opportunity without\u000a      competing with food production. Biofuel Wales Ltd has raised the amount of\u000a      &#163;1.2M to exploit the microwave plasma system at national and international\u000a      level, after successfully being granted a patent (GB2492861) to protect\u000a      the intellectual property resulting from the work at LJMU. The company has\u000a      also secured the sales of the technology rights to Sofiproteol-France with\u000a      an income generation of &#163;1.8M.\u000a    Stopford Projects Ltd\u000a      The Research and Innovations Manager of Stopford Projects Ltd said:\u000a      \"...results on the use of microwave plasma have proven the way forward in\u000a      delivery of a niche and efficient way of developing a new compact and\u000a      mobile gasifier; such capability currently cannot be achieved via\u000a      traditional means.\" Hence, Stopford is currently working with LJMU\u000a      researchers to develop the industrial pre market demonstrator supported by\u000a      the TSB to deliver the first microwave plasma gasifier for the treatment\u000a      of sludge waste generated for example from Untied Utilities and appointed\u000a      the manufacturing company Finning to commission the unit. This project has\u000a      created 7 jobs and safe guarded another 3. The company is currently\u000a      working with the University in commercial and license contract.\u000a    Recognition of this benefit led to the work being featured on the BBC One\u000a      show Sunday Politics (February 2012) as a prime example of cutting-edge\u000a      energy sector development.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The demand for biofuels and alternative energies is increasing globally\u000a      as a sustainable source of energy is sought for the future.

The studies carried out by the\u000a      Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show that to\u000a      achieve a 10% biofuel share in the European transport sector (the main\u000a      reason for the EU failing to meet Kyoto targets, which states that by the\u000a      end of the period 2008-2012 the EU level of greenhouse gas emissions\u000a      should be 8% below 1990 levels) it would be necessary to use 72% of\u000a      European agricultural land for growth of first generation feed-stocks.\u000a    To meet this challenge, we developed second generation biofuels from\u000a      waste. We have used novel microwave technologies, to address the\u000a      requirement to reduce fossil fuel use while providing a sustainable energy\u000a      for the future. Furthermore, the Institute recognised the need for\u000a      diversity to ensure energy security and has therefore developed advanced\u000a      alternative energy technologies which convert a range of waste products\u000a      into energy. Not only does this tackle the issue of energy production, it\u000a      also reduces the burden of waste materials sent to landfill.\u000a    This research, undertaken since 2008, has attracted a keen interest both\u000a      nationally and internationally, with &#8364;3.5M in funding provided by the EU\u000a      and &#163;2.6M from the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) in order to continue\u000a      the development of our unique microwave plasma gasification system while a\u000a      further &#8364;8M proposal has been submitted to the EU as part of the last FP7\u000a      call on Eco Innovation to build an industrial scale up process with\u000a      exploitation plan led by United Utilities. The reason for such interest is\u000a      clear when one considers the potential energy output of similar systems\u000a      (per tonne of waste) such as Municipal Solid Waste plants (685 kWh\/tonne)\u000a      and plasma arc gasification plants (816 kWh\/tonne). By comparison, the\u000a      microwave plasma gasification technology developed at LJMU, when at full\u000a      scale, has the potential to produce up to 2000 kWh\/tonne. This is mainly\u000a      due to the fact that the plasma-arc process consumes about 80% of the\u000a      energy generated while the microwave gasification process only consumes\u000a      20% of the energy generated.\u000a    Three related examples of work within the Institute are: (1) biodiesel\u000a      production from waste oil, (2) bioethanol production from low-grade\u000a      biomass and (3) the development of a mobile gasification system. All these\u000a      applications are using advanced and niche microwave technologies with\u000a      proven high efficiency in comparison with conventional thermal heating.\u000a    2.1. Biodiesel production from waste oil (2008-11)\u000a    Work led by Al-Shamma'a in collaboration with industrial partners from\u000a      Longma Clean Energy Ltd, Xpertrule Software Ltd and Catering Waste\u000a      Solutions Ltd developed a novel microwave reactor with associated fuzzy\u000a      control system, for conversion of waste oils into biodiesel [1,2]. Such\u000a      oils are typically high in free fatty acids, which is highly corrosive to\u000a      engines and generators; however other conversion methods require many\u000a      processing steps in addition to significant energy input. This research,\u000a      which was supported by the EU, TSB and Carbon Connections (grants 1-3 in\u000a      [6]), overcame these obstacles and resulted in the production of a fully\u000a      automated system for biodiesel generation. The system provided significant\u000a      benefits over existing technology, including the following:\u000a    \u000a      Reduction in the number of processing steps required for input waste\u000a        oil;\u000a      Tolerance to feedstock contamination, leading to fewer waste\u000a        by-products;\u000a      Low input energy requirements;\u000a      Significant reduction in catalyst requirement;\u000a      Low capital and operating cost leading to suitability for on-site fuel\u000a        conditioning.\u000a    \u000a    2.2. Bioethanol production from low-grade biomass (2010-12)\u000a    The European FP7 Research for the Benefit of SMEs funded research project\u000a      (grant 4 in [6]), MICROGRASS, led by Al-Shamma'a and Shaw, which drove the\u000a      development of an advanced microwave reactor [3] for the processing of\u000a      low-grade biomass material, such as grass. The developed technology\u000a      utilises a novel microwave plasma approach to induce the breakdown of\u000a      cellulose structures and lignin which provides rapid release of sugars for\u000a      fermentation, thus enhancing bioethanol production. This resulted in a\u000a      method which is less energy-intensive (requiring approx. 90% less energy\u000a      than current systems), less time-consuming and also less reliant upon\u000a      additional chemicals. The work was conducted in conjunction with Biofuel\u000a      Wales Ltd and the Fraunhofer Institute-Germany, Dara-Spain,\u000a      Dipolar-Sweden, Technosam-Romania. Our role was the full co-ordination of\u000a      the project and the development of the novel microwave reactor.\u000a    2.3. The development of a mobile gasification system (2008-2013)\u000a    Since 2008, work led by Al-Shamma'a and Shaw, has also considered an\u000a      alternative energy source to biofuels in gasification and\/or pyrolysis.\u000a      Such systems can fulfil a dual purpose: energy production and waste\u000a      processing. The notion of waste-to-energy systems has gained significant\u000a      popularity due to global energy and waste management issues. Thus the\u000a      system developed at the Institute, in collaboration with Stopford Projects\u000a      Ltd, has the potential of addressing the needs of industry in generating\u000a      additional energy while also helping to process biomass waste (e.g. food)\u000a      which would otherwise be sent to landfill. To date, a fully automated\u000a      laboratory scale advanced microwave plasma system [4,5] has been\u000a      successfully tested and evaluated. Our role in the project was to design,\u000a      construct and test the microwave plasma reactor. Initially this work was\u000a      funded by the Merseyside Special Investment Fund and the TSB (grants 5-7\u000a      in [6]), but received International exposure in 2012 when funding from the\u000a      EU FP7 programme (grant 8 in [6]) was granted to apply the technology to\u000a      the challenge of processing agricultural animal waste with partners from\u000a      Ashleigh Farms-Ireland, Acondaqua-Spain and Sairem-France. Our role is the\u000a      full co-ordination of the project and the development of the novel\u000a      microwave reactor. The success of this project has led Ashleigh Farms to\u000a      secure &#8364;10M, in 2013, to increase their farm capacity from 12000 pigs to\u000a      42000 and meeting the Irish government Renewables Obligation Certificate\u000a      (ROC) commitment.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27295","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    By virtue of collaborative working, targeted research communication and\u000a      stakeholder engagement, the GoWell research led by the University of\u000a      Glasgow has achieved meaningful and sustainable impact on policy-makers,\u000a      practitioners, professional bodies and voluntary, community and social\u000a      enterprise (VCSE) organisations, whose objectives extend across a broad\u000a      range of policy sectors, including: criminal justice and policing, health\u000a      and well-being, equalities, regeneration, and social housing.\u000a    Over the past two years, the Scottish Government has instituted a new\u000a      Regeneration Strategy. A Discussion Paper published in spring 2011\u000a      recognised the issue of slow progress on social regeneration and\u000a      attributed its acknowledgement to GoWell's findings [1]. The resulting\u000a      Strategy document Achieving\u000a          a Sustainable Future, published in December 2011, further\u000a      identified GoWell as one of the Scottish Government's main sources of\u000a      evidence on the effectiveness of different approaches to regeneration on\u000a      health outcomes, in part due to the programme's ability to investigate\u000a      pathways to health outcomes [2]. Reflecting this adoption of health as a\u000a      key outcome from regeneration, Tannahill was subsequently invited to join\u000a      the Scottish Government's Regeneration High Level Working Group Part of\u000a      the Group's remit was to consider issues specifically raised by the\u000a      Regeneration External Stakeholder Group, of which Kearns was also a\u000a      member. The researchers therefore ensured that GoWell findings and\u000a      insights continued to feed into the work of both groups, each of which\u000a      focused on how to ensure the delivery of regeneration outcomes.\u000a    In January 2013, the Scottish Parliament's Local Government and\u000a      Regeneration Committee launched an Inquiry into the delivery of\u000a      regeneration under the new strategy. GoWell was specially invited to give\u000a      both written and verbal evidence to the Inquiry. In giving evidence, the\u000a      research team highlighted research findings showing how measures of\u000a      community cohesion were less positive than other social indicators within\u000a      deprived areas, and that there was a lack of clarity amongst the partners\u000a      in regeneration regarding the distribution of responsibility for\u000a      implementation. They also pointed out how measures of health and wellbeing\u000a      could be used in evaluating the impact of regeneration [3].\u000a    GoWell's contribution to the Inquiry was further strengthened by the main\u000a      representative organisation for regeneration professionals in Scotland,\u000a      the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum, who used evidence from GoWell in\u000a      their own submission to the Inquiry to argue that the main health and\u000a      wellbeing outcome measures used in GoWell should be used in the future\u000a      monitoring and evaluation of regeneration strategies [4]. GoWell research\u000a      was also used to argue that neighbourhood quality and the means of its\u000a      delivery should be important components of the Scottish Government's\u000a      strategy to enhance wellbeing and reduce health inequalities. This point\u000a      and others have also been made through Tannahill serving on the SG's\u000a      Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities since 2008, and Kearns on\u000a      the `Equally Well' Glasgow Advisory Group since 2009. Both the Task Force\u000a      and the Advisory Group comprise government Ministers, representatives from\u000a      the NHS, local government, the Third Sector and others within community\u000a      planning partnerships resulting in the continuous research communication\u000a      by Kearns and colleagues of GoWell findings to all relevant user\u000a      communities working in the areas relating to health inequalities [5].\u000a    As part of the overall strategy on health inequalities, in 2008 the\u000a      Scottish Government launched its strategy on health and the environment,\u000a      called Good Places Better Health. The main work on the strategy\u000a      has been progressed through an evaluation group set up to study the\u000a      available evidence and make recommendations to improve neighbourhood\u000a      environments, primarily for children. As a consequence of the evidence\u000a      GoWell was producing Kearns was invited to join the evaluation group.\u000a      During this process, a Scottish Government seminar was held in September\u000a      2011 at which Kearns presented the idea of establishing a Scottish\u000a      Neighbourhood Quality Standard, including suggestions as to its possible\u000a      coverage and how it might be used as a policy tool [6]. The final\u000a        report from the Good Places Better Health group, published\u000a      in December 2011, then recommended the development of a `Scottish\u000a      Neighbourhood Quality Standard' as \"a means of enabling the implementation\u000a      of neighbourhood asset development\" [7]. During 2012, civil servants\u000a      worked on the further development of the idea, in consultation with\u000a      Kearns, and in March 2013, it was presented to the Ministerial Task Force\u000a      on Health Inequalities to seek their support for its further development\u000a      alongside national policy for architecture and design, thus bridging two\u000a      policy sectors [8]. As a consequence, NHS Health Scotland is now working\u000a      on the further development of relevant standards and policy tools.\u000a    GoWell's findings on the influence of alcohol outlets on crime rates,\u000a      which relate specifically to the consumer environment component of\u000a      neighbourhood quality, were widely reported in different media outlets\u000a      [9]. The findings were also shared with Strathclyde Police (now Police\u000a      Scotland), who used them to define the nature of `overprovision' of\u000a      alcohol outlets as a policy problem within the context of the Local\u000a      Licensing Forum, where evidence to underpin the city's licensing policy is\u000a      discussed. The main charity involved in alcohol policy in Scotland,\u000a      Alcohol Focus Scotland (AFS), also incorporated the findings into its\u000a      resource toolkit for licensing stakeholders, Good\u000a          Licensing Practice: Developing an Effective Overprovision Policy.\u000a      The toolkit is intended to assist licensing boards to use evidence in the\u000a      development of their policies on `overprovision' of alcohol outlets so\u000a      that they can withstand legal challenge where license applications are\u000a      refused in certain localities. In this case, GoWell's findings are having\u000a      impact at both the national and city levels, and with regard to policy and\u000a      practice. By providing the `Licensing Toolkit', which draws from GoWell\u000a      research, in this way, AFS works to ensure the control of alcohol as a\u000a      means of reducing long term alcohol related harm. The AFS Toolkit was\u000a      provided to 40 Licensing Boards and 40 Local Licensing Forums, and had\u000a      been accessed on the AFS website a further 1,600 times by September 2013.\u000a    GoWell research, then, as well as making an influential contribution to\u000a      the work of charities, law enforcement agencies, and regulatory bodies to\u000a      support the controlled provision of alcohol outlets has informed the work\u000a      of civil servants, politicians, government Ministers, regeneration\u000a      professionals and third sector organisations in turn shaping Scottish\u000a      Government strategies and policies to secure neighbourhood and community\u000a      improvement.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Housing and regeneration programmes both in the UK and internationally\u000a      have struggled to have lasting impacts upon the places where they are\u000a      enacted.

In addition, Glasgow City Council, in partnership with GHA,\u000a      established a programme of regeneration across eight Transformational\u000a      Regeneration Areas (TRAs) and seven Local Regeneration Areas (LRAs) across\u000a      the city. These programmes are ongoing.\u000a    In 2005, Professors Kearns (University of Glasgow, 1987-), Tannahill\u000a      (Hon. Research Fellow, University of Glasgow, 2004-) and others commenced\u000a      a research and learning programme, GoWell, to study the impacts of housing\u000a      improvements and area regeneration interventions on the health and\u000a      wellbeing of individuals, households and communities, using a prospective,\u000a      comparative, multi-methods research design. The research programme, led by\u000a      the University of Glasgow, remains unique within the urban studies field\u000a      in its range of objectives and methods; the Programme's use of multiple\u000a      methods to evaluate a complex policy intervention has enhanced its reach\u000a      and significance. GoWell is supported by organisations at both national\u000a      and local levels, with stakeholders widening over time to include the\u000a      following: three departments of Scottish Government &#8212; communities, health,\u000a      and justice; NHS Health Scotland; NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde; Glasgow\u000a      Housing Association; and Glasgow City Council.\u000a    The research components and methods employed within GoWell include:\u000a      longitudinal quantitative and qualitative research with cross-sectional\u000a      sample groups drawn from residents and families in the 15 study\u000a      communities; interviews with policy-makers; case studies of housing and\u000a      regeneration processes in particular areas; evaluations of neighbourhood\u000a      initiatives; ecological monitoring of health and social changes across all\u000a      communities in the city; and analysis of secondary data sources relating\u000a      to particular outcomes. These multiple methods enable the researchers both\u000a      to corroborate findings from different sources and also to seek\u000a      explanations for findings from the main survey. To date the programme has\u000a      produced the following range of outputs: 114 newsletters for the study\u000a      communities; over 40 reports for wider stakeholders and the public; 20\u000a      briefing papers for policy-makers and practitioners; and 26 peer-reviewed\u000a      articles for academic audiences.\u000a    The following four selected findings show how different elements of the\u000a      research combine to produce evidence that has impact within all relevant\u000a      policy communities:\u000a    1. Health and wellbeing is a legitimate and necessary outcome of\u000a        regeneration and can be positively affected by improvements in\u000a        residential conditions.\u000a    The research team showed that particular elements of both dwellings and\u000a      neighbourhoods were strongly associated with positive mental health; in\u000a      particular that better aesthetic qualities of the home and neighbourhood\u000a      increased the probability of residents demonstrating higher levels of\u000a      positive mental health. The Scottish Government has recently committed to\u000a      improving the population mean score on a measure of positive mental health\u000a      &#8212; the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). This is the first\u000a      community-level study to use WEMWBS as an outcome measure and to show its\u000a      responsiveness to residential conditions [1]. By analysing their data in\u000a      the context of a different health outcome measure, the Short Form Health\u000a      Survey, the GoWell research team showed that housing investments improved\u000a      mental but not physical health, and further demonstrated that living\u000a      through neighbourhood demolition did not necessarily cause a deterioration\u000a      in health, due to other supportive measures [2].\u000a    2. There is a need for stronger implementation of social regeneration.\u000a    The research highlighted that more rapid progress was being made on\u000a      physical renewal than on social regeneration and identified the need for\u000a      community development activities. Subsequent analysis showed that measures\u000a      of close social contact could improve, whilst measures of wider social\u000a      connectedness, trust and cohesion deteriorated. The qualitative research\u000a      also showed that, from the residents' perspective, social environment is a\u000a      stronger influence upon health issues than physical environment [3].\u000a    3. Neighbourhood quality is important to achieving health improvement.\u000a    A new conceptual framework was developed by the GoWell research team, led\u000a      by the University of Glasgow, translating the notion of psychosocial risk\u000a      and pathways from studies within workplace settings to the residential\u000a      context. This was applied to the GoWell survey data to show that\u000a      psychosocial processes could operate through dimensions of presentation,\u000a      relative social position, control, status and empowerment to link\u000a      neighbourhood quality to mental wellbeing [4]. Moreover, the researchers\u000a      pointed out that ignoring these aspects of the neighbourhood could\u000a      undermine the psychosocial benefits of control and status derived from\u000a      housing improvements [5].\u000a    4. The consumer environment is a key neighbourhood dimension for\u000a        regeneration to act upon to improve health and wellbeing outcomes.\u000a    Findings showed clear links between neighbourhood amenities and health\u000a      behaviours such as walking and diet, and concluded that the consumer\u000a      environment was a key area for regeneration, though often difficult to act\u000a      upon since it required market intervention. This was emphasised through\u000a      ecological analysis across Glasgow. Strathclyde Police supplied post-coded\u000a      crime data for a 10-year period and Glasgow City Council supplied details\u000a      of all licensed alcohol outlets. This data was combined with measures of\u000a      area deprivation and community demography to investigate structural\u000a      influences on crime rates. The strongest influence on local crime rates,\u000a      after the level of area deprivation, was the number of licensed alcohol\u000a      outlets in an area. A doubling of the number of alcohol outlets in an area\u000a      was associated with a near-doubling of the local crime rate, after other\u000a      factors were controlled for [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28042","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Pathways: Building on the early impact of Wong's ESRC research,\u000d\u000a      further studies were carried out for government departments &#8212; ODPM\/DCLG -\u000d\u000a      leading to her appointment to advisory roles of government and agencies\u000d\u000a      and other international collaboration.

Findings were directly used by the ODPM to\u000d\u000a        update the 2005 guidance (ODPM Update 2\/2008). Moreover, the SPO\u000d\u000a      framework has further shifted the mind-set and practice of spatial policy\u000d\u000a      monitoring in new directions by offering an integrative framework that\u000d\u000a      moved away from the traditional linear monitoring ethos, towards\u000d\u000a      collaborative, reflexive and double loop learning &#8212; to `question the goal\u000d\u000a      whilst solving the problem' &#8212; approach for monitoring complex spatial\u000d\u000a      policies.

UoM researchers were\u000d\u000a      also commissioned by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) to apply\u000d\u000a      spatial analysis to develop `A Map for England' (www.mapforengland.co.uk)\u000d\u000a      to provide the evidence base for the planning of infrastructure and\u000d\u000a      services and enable decision makers at the local level to make more\u000d\u000a      informed policy choices [3]. Following major media reports on BBC Radio\u000d\u000a      4's `Today' and `You and Yours' programmes, the map findings were\u000d\u000a      presented on the RTPI pilot website, and subsequently drawn upon by\u000d\u000a      politicians to illustrate their points within the `Growth and\u000d\u000a      Infrastructure Public Bill Committee' [4]. The BIS Minister Michael Fallon\u000d\u000a      and Shadow Planning Minister Dr Roberta Blackman-Woods referred to the\u000d\u000a      maps, showing the relationship between superfast broadband coverage and\u000d\u000a      National Park boundaries, and commenting that National Parks have some of\u000d\u000a      the worst access to (and availability of) superfast broadband in England;\u000d\u000a      with National Parks in the North of England particularly poorly served, as\u000d\u000a      the availability of superfast broadband varies between and within National\u000d\u000a      Parks. Blackman-Woods also made the point that there is clearly an issue\u000d\u000a      that needs to be addressed in the East of England which is both a growth\u000d\u000a      area (and an internationally renowned centre for research) and an area\u000d\u000a      that receives a low rating by Ofcom for superfast broadband availability.\u000d\u000a      The RTPI President Colin Haylock noted that: \"with a Map for England\u000d\u000a        policy makers could make better judgments about how individual policy\u000d\u000a        proposals interact with and affect development of the country as a\u000d\u000a        whole. Such an initiative would also increase consistency in the\u000d\u000a        appraisal of policy, improve security and resilience, and provide a\u000d\u000a        better understanding of sectoral issues that might complement or\u000d\u000a        conflict with each other\" [3].\u000d\u000a    Impact 4: International arena: key references, advisory roles and\u000d\u000a        professional practices. The World Bank includes Wong's Urban\u000d\u000a        Studies paper [D] as a key reference under its `Local Economic\u000d\u000a      Development (LED): a Primer' [5] which continues to impact on shaping\u000d\u000a      policy and practice across the world. Similarly, [B] is referenced by the\u000d\u000a      LED Network of Africa (LEDNA) [6]. More specifically, Wong's 2006 Book [B]\u000d\u000a      has an impact on shaping the policy discourse in Australia over the\u000d\u000a      development of sustainability indicators. The `Sustainability Indicators'\u000d\u000a      report, prepared by the Cairns and Far North Environment Centre for its\u000d\u000a      community forum in 2008 [7], made key recommendations to State and Local\u000d\u000a      Government about the role and context of sustainability indicators, by\u000d\u000a      extensively citing direct quotations from [B] nine times, and using the\u000d\u000a      five broad principles established in the book as a benchmark for their\u000d\u000a      activities. In the EU context, principal component analysis applied in [D]\u000d\u000a      was also used in `Urban Audit Analysis II' (2010) and Wong was the Expert\u000d\u000a      Panel Member to oversee the preparation of the report and made comments\u000d\u000a      over its methodology in 2008\/09 [8]. More recently, Wong was invited by\u000d\u000a      the UN-Habitat BLP Partner at the Middle East to join an Expert Group\u000d\u000a      Meeting (10-11th May 2013) to evaluate and revise the current\u000d\u000a      `City Prosperity Index' (CPI). In the invitation letter, the Director of\u000d\u000a      MERC-BLP specifically mentions that: \"We are aware that you have\u000d\u000a        conducted extensive studies and research in the field of Urban\u000d\u000a        Prosperity, and that you have prepared and published a research paper\u000d\u000a        under the title of `The Relationship Between Quality of Life and Local\u000d\u000a        Economic Development: An Empirical Study of Local Authority Areas in\u000d\u000a        England' [E]\" [9].\u000d\u000a    Wong and Baker are currently involved in an international consultancy\u000d\u000a      team led by Nanjing University (China) to develop an innovative indicator\u000d\u000a      framework to monitor the progress of the new `Shantou Master Plan'.\u000d\u000a      Learning from the experience of developing the SPO in England, the broad\u000d\u000a      principles of developing `an integrative, collaborative, reflexive and\u000d\u000a      flexible' indicators framework with a map-based visual interface were\u000d\u000a      presented, in April 2013, to the international expert panel and senior\u000d\u000a      planners and politicians of the Shantou Government. The project's director\u000d\u000a      commented that \"adapting certain key principles you developed for\u000d\u000a        monitoring spatial planning policies and outcomes in England to apply to\u000d\u000a        the complex administrative and governing contexts of Shantou are very\u000d\u000a        helpful. In particular, your ideas of adopting a gradual, incremental\u000d\u000a        approach to policy monitoring, with a more focused and flexible spatial\u000d\u000a        framework for indicators analysis that emphasises on the communicative\u000d\u000a        aspects of policy learning are seen as an innovative practice in China\u000d\u000a        and make an important contribution to our on-going work on the master\u000d\u000a        plan\" [10]. This on- going engagement further demonstrates the\u000d\u000a      continuing impact of UoM research in shaping international practices of\u000d\u000a      policy monitoring.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study demonstrates how extensive University of Manchester (UoM)\u000d\u000a      research over nearly two decades has led to a step change in policy\u000d\u000a      monitoring practices, through the development of innovative indicator\u000d\u000a      methodologies that have strong analytical, learning and spatial emphases.\u000d\u000a      The key impact was the direct translation of a UoM research report into\u000d\u000a      the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's (ODPM) official spatial planning\u000d\u000a      monitoring guidance, with all 394 English local planning authorities\u000d\u000a      required to comply with evidence-based plan-making.

The previous studies were largely concerned with\u000d\u000a      the monitoring of national conditions, which are often different from\u000d\u000a      those that inform spatially-oriented urban and regional policies. UoM\u000d\u000a      research has filled this gap, developing innovative methodologies to\u000d\u000a      improve the technical and statistical measures of indicators (with spatial\u000d\u000a      and dynamic dimensions); integrating a learning and analytical approach of\u000d\u000a      policy monitoring; improving the understanding of policy concepts; linking\u000d\u000a      the analysis to different socio-political contexts; using visual\u000d\u000a      interpretation; and engaging key stakeholders in the process to develop a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive framework.\u000d\u000a    Wong's ESRC Fellowship (1995-98) at UoM laid down the foundation\u000d\u000a      for this area of research for the next two decades.

Six core design\u000d\u000a      principles were established: (1) the structure-performance model; (2) the\u000d\u000a      objectives-targets- indicators approach; (3) a nested hierarchy of\u000d\u000a      indicators; (4) a framework of indicators; (5) the use of analytical\u000d\u000a      indicator bundles; and (6) analytical principles.

Comments\u000a      included: \"It helped create a warm collaborative atmosphere, excellent\u000a        debate, clear priorities and\u000a        an excellent record of the process and results; and \"It's more\u000a        inclusive and helps people to\u000a        communicate, take in one another's ideas, see connections\". The form\u000a      of the kit was important:\u000a      \"More engaging &#8212; easy to distinguish between different ideas\/themes\u000a        with the different leaves\";\u000a      indeed, if not for Ketso 62% said they would use flip charts and post-it\u000a      notes, and 38% would use\u000a      traditional meetings and workshops, or dialogue techniques such as world\u000a      caf&#233;. Comments on the\u000a      value of the toolkit for facilitators included: \"It combines the\u000a        principles behind parallel thinking (six\u000a        hats), appreciative enquiry, etc. in one simple, accessible and low-tech\u000a        process\"; and \"Ketso is\u000a        unique, it's easy to explain how it works and what people have to do\"\u000a      [3]. Similarly, a recent public\u000a      sector and NGO workshop produced a \"shared agreement that Ketso is\u000a        unique in its ability to not\u000a        only surface new thoughts but also to provide a credible and traceable\u000a        evidence base for\u000a        recommendations that emerge from consultation\" [5]; and the Social\u000a      Marketing Officer from South\u000a      Lanarkshire Community Links stated that: \"Using the Ketso toolkit\u000a        gives those using it a `voice' and\u000a        the leaves acts like giving each participant a `microphone' to use as a\u000a        platform for discussion\" [1].\u000a    Range: Ketso is used in 27 countries, including: Peru, Cameroon,\u000a      Russia, Australia, USA and\u000a      Germany [1]. Over 300 customers use 530 kits, in high-profile\u000a      organisations such as Merseycare\u000a      NHS and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA).Equality\u000a      Network In total, &gt;8,000\u000a      people have used Ketso, including 3325 participants in 125 events run by\u000a      the Ketso team. Over 65\u000a      universities use Ketso in research, staff development and teaching, with\u000a      Dr. Tippett awarded a\u000a      2011 AESOP Teaching Excellence Prize in part due to the innovation of\u000a      Ketso in teaching [4].\u000a    Ketso has changed professional practice, with independent survey\u000a      respondents confirming this:\u000a      \"We have used it to change the way we run certain meetings\" and\u000a        \"Outside partners have\u000a        described our meetings as fun and highly productive.\" Changes cited\u000a      as a result of using Ketso\u000a      include: \"Effectively re-balanced workload between team members;\u000a        resulted in problem areas\u000a        rising to the surface\"; \"An ineffective Student Council has transformed\u000a        itself and is now very active\u000a        and engaged!\"; \"It helped to invigorate and re-develop a scrutiny\u000a        liaison committee that serves a\u000a        number of councils\"; \"Generated a new policy around PhD examination.\u000a        Altered policy and practice\u000a        on plagiarism for PGT\"; and \"Process review and enhancement of\u000a        university administrative\u000a        processes\" [3]. In all cases users indicated Ketso was chosen\u000a      because it enables groups to work\u000a      together to achieve better shared outcomes, and in less time than\u000a      traditional approaches. For\u000a      instance, a National School of Government event (Civil Service Live) in\u000a      2011 involved two hundred\u000a      civil servants in discussions on the future of learning in the public\u000a      sector. The subsequent report\u000a      referenced the key role of Ketso, highlighting its basis in research [4].\u000a    A networking event in Scotland with 11 customers identified 50 outcomes\u000a      or benefits from using\u000a      Ketso, including improved: research, training, procedures and guidelines,\u000a      service design and\u000a      understanding between teams of roles, remits and resources. A specific\u000a      example was: \"Defined\u000a        divisional aim; objectives identified to action for upcoming year (it'\u000a        is a good way to identify that all\u000a        staff are reaching for the same outcome)\" [1]. The Head of Refugee\u000a      Integration, Scottish Refugee\u000a      Council commented, \"Asset based planning has been discussed for many\u000a        years, and this is one of\u000a        the few times that I have actually seen it work in practice. I feel\u000a        strongly that our sector, and others,\u000a        often focus on vulnerability to the neglect of recognising resilience:\u000a        this tool provides a safeguard\u000a        against this trap. [For example] the RiSC thematic working groups, where\u000a        unexpected\u000a        opportunities and goals were identified... I believe if that we had not\u000a        used Ketso as a participation\u000a        and engagement tool these may not have been identified or been so\u000a        prominent. I have seen how\u000a        the kit can help generate innovation, moving people from a position of\u000a        cynicism to one of fresh\u000a        thinking and energy... You have a way to manage the dominant voices that\u000a        is powerful and\u000a        unusual in my experience of participatory processes\" [5]. A key\u000a      issue discussed was how Ketso\u000a      and its spreadsheet allows you to see issues emerging in the data that\u000a      would not otherwise be\u000a      visible, enabling identification of patterns, \"surprising themes from\u000a        the synthesis of participants'\u000a        ideas that may run counter to the dominant power structures and\u000a        perceived wisdom\" [5]. The\u000a      physicality of Ketso gives everyone a voice, allowing blending of\u000a      technical and lay information\u000a      through co-production, which generates innovation and knowledge that\u000a      `sticks'.\u000a    Planning: Ketso is featured as a method in the latest edition of\u000a      the `Community Planning\u000a      Handbook', and was the key engagement tool in Renfrewshire Council's\u000a      Community Planning\u000a      Conference in 2011, in which 458 community members developed over 2000\u000a      ideas for the future\u000a      plan. A Council Policy Officer confirms this: \"The majority of\u000a        participants agreed that this workshop\u000a        format gave everyone a voice and took the pressure off facilitators.\"\u000a      98% of participants responded\u000a      positively to the question: `Do you agree that the workshop allowed\u000a      participants to work together,\u000a      share ideas and be creative?' (n=293), with comments such as: \"I found\u000a        this year's workshops to\u000a        be a much better concept, much more involvement from whole group\"\u000a      [6]. An action plan\u000a      developed from the outputs was a driver for a `Community Plan Review', and\u000a      Renfrewshire has\u000a      since used Ketso with 323 senior managers in their 2012 Managers'\u000a      Seminars, and other\u000a      workshops seeking to implement ideas from the 2011 Conference. In 2012\u000a      there were 15 requests\u000a      from other services and partners to use the Ketso kits owned by the Chief\u000a      Executive's Service, with\u000a      the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) inviting Renfrewshire\u000a      to discuss Ketso in\u000a      community planning with 68 public sector delegates [6]. When asked to whom\u000a      they would\u000a      recommend Ketso, one survey customer commented \"the whole of Scotland,\u000a        because it works and\u000a        it's brilliant\" [3]. Ketso was also used in RTPI NW CPD with 30\u000a      planners, subsequently being\u000a      awarded a commendation in 2013 from the RTPI NW for its \"contribution\u000a        towards positive\u000a        community engagement\" [6].\u000a    Vulnerable Communities: The Scottish Government, Scottish Refugee\u000a      Council and COSLA used\u000a      Ketso as the key engagement tool for the `Refugees in Scotland's\u000a      Communities' project (2012-13)\u000a      that brought together groups of experts to consider refugee integration\u000a      [7]. The Scottish\u000a      Government's `Equality and Diversity' and `National Records' teams\u000a      requested training in 2013 to\u000a      develop the use of Ketso for internal and external engagement. Similarly,\u000a      Glasgow Refugee,\u000a      Asylum and Migration Network (GRAMNet) have used Ketso extensively in\u000a      research and\u000a      engagement across Scotland, as well as in Russia, Jordan and Gaza.\u000a      GRAMNet's co-director\u000a      comments: \"Most research methods make vulnerable people feel like they\u000a        are in a deportation\u000a        interview, but with Ketso people feel they can genuinely explore ideas\u000a        together\" [7], with the annual\u000a      report noting that, \"the research and conception behind Ketso has\u000a        enabled GRAMNet to devise\u000a        innovative partnerships and projects and harness the creative capacity\u000a        of its members\", leading to\u000a      &#163;5 million of successful funding bids [7]. Ketso has been widely used in\u000a      health and social care;\u000a      such as in 13 NHS Trusts, including Merseyside.\u000a    Environmental Management: Countryscape has used Ketso to engage\u000a      with stakeholders, from\u000a      landscape character assessments to developing a climate change strategy\u000a      for Manchester [8].\u000a      Their Creative Director comments: \"I would estimate that we have run\u000a        workshops with over 1000\u000a        participants with Ketso. We have found that Ketso is a fantastic tool\u000a        that has greatly improved how\u000a        we manage workshops, consultations and community planning events... most\u000a        importantly it\u000a        produces results that are clear and can be acted upon\" [8]. Using\u000a      Ketso led to Johannesburg's\u000a      Environmental Management Department being awarded a `Clean and Green\u000a      Campaign' award for\u000a      the best community development programme in the Gauteng province [1].\u000a      Ketso was also seen as\u000a      central to the success of Wandle River Trust's catchment planning\u000a      workshops [8].\u000a    Social Business: Ketso was developed as a case study in social\u000a      enterprise [9] and includes open-\u000a      source resources to support customers and invite further innovation. Nine\u000a      training videos have\u000a      made the rationale behind Ketso more widely available, and four external\u000a      organisations have made\u000a      videos about Ketso. Together, these videos have been downloaded 7,990\u000a      times since 2010\u000a      (www.youtube.com\/ketsoltd).\u000a      The Ketso website has had 18,677 unique viewers and 27,550 visits\u000a      (11\/2010 - 9\/2013, Google Analytics) with the Ketso Twitter account\u000a      attracting 297 followers\u000a      (@KetsoLtd, 3\/2013-7\/2013). Ketso was also showcased at an `Enterprise\u000a      Educators UK Best\u000a      Practice' event (2010), and following Ketso's role in ESRC\/EPSRC\u000a      enterprise training, it was used\u000a      with 100 delegates at the International Enterprise Educators' Conference\u000a      (2011) [1]. As a business,\u000a      Ketso generates revenue and creates employment, locally and\u000a      internationally (in manufacturing,\u000a      office-work and training). Turnover for the last four years was &#163;175,000,\u000a      with components sourced\u000a      from ethical suppliers in India and Bangladesh. Assembly is undertaken at\u000a      Paperworks, a sheltered\u000a      workshop in Leeds, where Ketso has also been used in skills development\u000a      for employees with\u000a      learning disabilities. A Paperworks trainee commented: \"We used Ketso\u000a        to do a trainee lesson, it\u000a        was fantastic, I did not even lose concentration\" [1]. The Managing\u000a      Director of Motif (a fair-trade\u000a      Ketso supplier) confirms: \"We have also used Ketso with partners in\u000a        Bangladesh, for example with\u000a        OASIS, an organisation based in Dhaka, which works on issues of human\u000a        trafficking. They were\u000a        very impressed at how the kit helped them find direction using\u000a        everyone's ideas more readily than\u000a        previous methods they had used\" [9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Ketso is a social business, selling and renting a hands-on kit for\u000a      creative engagement that provides\u000a      table-top tools to record and display ideas, enhancing group productivity\u000a      and creativity. Ketso is the\u000a      only documented spin-off company from ESRC funded research, which was\u000a      conducted at the\u000a      University of Manchester (UoM).

The\u000a      conceptual framework synthesised\u000a      design theory, participatory planning, landscape ecology and ecological\u000a      design, using `systems\u000a      thinking' for integration [D]. The research cycled between developing\u000a      theoretical insights and\u000a      testing them in practice, working with a wide range of partners in the\u000a      public, private and civic\u000a      sectors [C]. This active interface between theory and scholarly\u000a      development through practice has\u000a      contributed to the research's impact and originality. Data sources\u000a      included: `before and after'\u000a      interviews; participants' reflective journals; participant observation and\u000a      interviews with 19 key\u000a      decision makers in the region. Visioning workshops, held over several\u000a      months, allowed the toolkit\u000a      to be refined in response to emergent findings [C].\u000a    Each component of Ketso was designed to embody a key principle of\u000a      community engagement or\u000a      creative thinking, identified from action research (with 51\u000a      stakeholders\/residents). Uniquely, the\u000a      toolkit guides the facilitator via its physical components, such as the\u000a      different coloured leaves; a\u000a      recognition of the value of metaphors in encouraging different ways of\u000a      thinking. The research\u000a      showed that the tactile and visual nature of the toolkit was important in\u000a      enabling participants to\u000a      build a shared picture of their thinking, and to see their ideas from\u000a      different perspectives, leading to\u000a      creative solutions and a shared ownership of ideas. Using a hands-on\u000a      approach with stakeholders\u000a      served as `proof of principle', and was viewed as a major factor in the\u000a      project's success, with local\u000a      citizens able to engage effectively with the planning process [C]. A\u000a        key finding was that the\u000a        physical form of the toolkit might enable non-professional facilitators\u000a        to employ the\u000a        process trialled in the research. In subsequent research with the\u000a      Environment Agency and\u000a      Manchester City Council (2005) (&#163;14,250), novice facilitators delivered a\u000a      `Green City Network'\u000a      launch event for over 100 people, with data about the role of Ketso in\u000a      enabling this process\u000a      collected, including: participant feedback, interviews with the\u000a      facilitators and participant observation\u000a      [B]. The principles underlying the toolkit were made explicit,\u000a      demonstrating that it can be used by\u000a      non-professional facilitators to implement learning from the original\u000a      research.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28094","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pathways: The projects outlined provide a conceptual framework, an\u000a      evidence base, and valuable decision support tools, for UK and overseas\u000a      stakeholders to enhance their understanding of urban climate change\u000a      impacts and adaptation, and to develop strategies and actions in response.\u000a      A key characteristic of this research is its collaborative nature, with a\u000a      specific focus on building capacity to adapt. The GRaBS tools were thus an\u000a      attempt to seek out opportunities to support the development of adaptation\u000a      strategies and responses, an approach subsequently adopted in the\u000a      EcoCities and CLUVA projects; the latter seeking to assist African cities\u000a      to manage climate risks, reduce vulnerability and increase climate change\u000a      resilience.\u000a    More broadly, the collaborative methods employed across these projects\u000a      have encouraged the development of policy-relevant and user-focused\u000a      outputs. Accordingly, stakeholders who have been directly engaged in the\u000a      research have acted as `champions' for associated outputs, creating\u000a      immediate and powerful pathways to impact, including The Mersey Forest's\u000a      project director notes UoM's \"significant contribution to building the\u000a        case for and assessing the effectiveness of green infrastructure as a\u000a        powerful tool for urban climate change adaptation. These ideas are now\u000a        incorporated into all of our green infrastructure plans and strategies\u000a        that have been completed for a range of public bodies. We have also used\u000a        the work to support international projects such as ForeStClim... These\u000a        approaches continue to influence the work of the Mersey Forest.\"\u000a      [1]. At a national level, the TCPA have confirmed that UoM's \"work on\u000a        urban climate change adaptation, coupled with ongoing stakeholder\u000a        engagement, has helped to build capacity for assessing climate change\u000a        impacts and risks in urban areas\" [2]. The work has become an\u000a      exemplar of co-produced research, with academics working in tandem with\u000a      public policy makers, urban practitioners, private sector interests and\u000a      stakeholders. Working relationships and ongoing dialogue have been\u000a      maintained over time, acting as a central platform for securing impact.\u000a      The most significant include links with local councils throughout Greater\u000a      Manchester [3] and ongoing engagement and dissemination alongside the TCPA\u000a      [2]. Research outputs have impacted on a range of sectors and policy\u000a      domains such as spatial planning, flood risk management and green\u000a      infrastructure, at the local, regional and international scales.\u000a    Greater Manchester Impact: The EcoCities project has fostered\u000a      innovative collaboration between UoM and the public and private\u000a      sectors in Greater Manchester. EcoCities was funded via a charitable\u000a      donation from the commercial property company, Bruntwood. This funding\u000a      route demonstrates the degree to which the adaptation agenda has become\u000a      established in Greater Manchester, signalling that related research,\u000a      driven forward by UoM, is sufficiently developed and relevant to attract\u000a      interest and funding from non-public sources. EcoCities also stimulated\u000a      the signing of a `memorandum of understanding' (MOU) between UoM and\u000a      Manchester City Council (MCC) committing the partners to work more closely\u000a      on climate change issues. The leader of MCC recognises this as \"a\u000a        central platform for our ongoing engagement with the University\",\u000a      further noting that UoM research has contributed to MCC's Core Strategy,\u000a      and: \"provides us with the robust evidence base needed to make\u000a        informed decisions at both a local level and city region scale. We can\u000a        therefore confirm that research undertaken at UoM has substantially\u000a        improved MCC's understanding of climate change, and has supported the\u000a        development of adaptation strategies and responses to locally prevalent\u000a        climate change impact... The key output to this will be the development\u000a        of a Green Infrastructure framework for Manchester... put[ting]\u000a        the City at the forefront of Climate Change research and help make\u000a        Manchester a truly Green City.\" [4]\u000a    EcoCities researchers have sat on steering committees tasked with\u000a      developing adaptation strategies for the City of Manchester and the\u000a      conurbation of Greater Manchester, with the resulting strategies\u000a      referencing both the project and its role in progressing adaptation in the\u000a      conurbation [3][4]. The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities\u000a      (AGMA) Director of Environment has recognised the value of the research,\u000a      noting that Ecocites \"has been successful in bringing academic\u000a        research outputs closer to policy making audiences... Climate change\u000a        adaptation research... including the ASCCUE and EcoCities projects, has\u000a        supported the development of strategic adaptation responses in Greater\u000a        Manchester... significantly influenc[ing] the development and\u000a        content of the Greater Manchester Climate Change Strategy (2012) and\u000a        Implementation Plan (2013)... Ecocities research in particular... was\u000a        adopted by the GM Environment Commission as our baseline research in\u000a        this field in July 2012.... [UoM] is a key partner and\u000a        stakeholder in Greater Manchester's Low Carbon Hub with representative's\u000a        holding seats on several of the Hub Board's Sub-groups.\" [3]. This\u000a      work has been transmitted broadly, with the EcoCities website (www.adaptingmanchester.co.uk)\u000a      receiving 4240 visitors, from a range of countries, between its launch in\u000a      May 2012 and June 2013, and the BBC featuring EcoCities, successfully\u000a      highlighting the issues it raises to an international audience [5].\u000a    National Impact: Accordingly, the research has attracted national\u000a      interest. Citations include:\u000a    i. Referenced in the literature review supporting the UK Climate Change\u000a      Risk Assessment.\u000a    ii.

A CABE Space document on the role of public space in adapting to\u000a      climate change.\u000a    v. The vital role of green spaces, cited by the Technology Strategy\u000a      Board. [6]\u000a    The TCPA referenced ASCCUE heavily within their influential 2007 guide\u000a      `Adaptation by Design'; as their chief executive notes, \"this document\u000a        remains influential and continues to be utilised by stakeholders... for\u000a        example the TCPA used the outputs of the GRaBS project in 24 local\u000a        authority councillor training workshops in Yorkshire and the Humber\u000a        between October 2012 and February 2013\" [2]. The TCPA has also\u000a      utilised UoM adaptation research for lobbying purposes, with the \"outcomes\u000a        and insights that have emerged from the ASCCUE and GRaBS projects....\u000a        Instrumental in the TCPA campaigning for urban adaptation and green\u000a        spaces... informing TCPA policy responses to consultations such as the\u000a      [UK Government's] `Natural Environment White Paper\" [2]. Similarly,\u000a      members of the UoM research team have made invited contributions in this\u000a      field, for example to the `Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution'\u000a      and the UK Government's `Adaptation Sub Committee'. Nationally, local\u000a      authorities including the City of Southampton and the London Borough of\u000a      Sutton, have used GRaBS to inform the development and implementation of\u000a      adaptation `action plans' (www.grabs-eu.org\/partners.php).GRaBS\u000a      was recently included in DEFRA's `National Adaptation Programme' &#8212;\u000a      outlining the Government's responsibilities under Section 58 of the\u000a      Climate Change Act (2008) - where it was noted that GRaBS \"was one of\u000a        the first projects to recognise the crucial role of green and blue space\u000a        infrastructure adaptation to help create more resilient urban areas\"\u000a      [7].\u000a    European Impact: UoM research has been influential at the European\u000a      level. Informed by the GRaBS decision support tools, eleven European\u000a      municipalities and regions (including the Province of Genoa and the\u000a      Amsterdam district of Nieuw-West) now have strategies in place to progress\u000a      climate change adaptation responses, raise awareness and bolster local\u000a      adaptive capacity, with adaptation plans and strategies available to view\u000a      on the GRaBS website (www.grabs-eu.org).\u000a      This strand of research is still productive, and associated impact is\u000a      increasing. For instance, in June 2012 GRaBS won the European Commission's\u000a      DG for Regional Policy `RegioStars Award' as the best project in the\u000a      Sustainable Growth category (one of 5 winners from 107 entries). The jury\u000a      noted that: \"While there are many projects working on the environmental\u000a        aspects of green and blue infrastructure, this project goes further in\u000a        assessing the social and economic benefits...\" The European\u000a      Commission has also utilised ASCCUE in their work on vulnerabilities\u000a      inherent in the `compact city' [8].\u000a    Yet further afield, GRaBS was presented at COP17, the UN's annual climate\u000a      change conference (Durban, December 2011). Subsequently, the GRaBS\u000a      approach to climate change adaptation in cities was adopted by the\u000a      International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), giving\u000a      the project the potential to support urban adaptation planning in cities\u000a      across the world. These themes are taken up within ongoing UoM research\u000a      (including `Adaptation Strategies for European Cities' and `Climate Proof\u000a      Cities'). The former, funded by the EC (2012-2013, &#8364;36.2k), is supporting\u000a      the development of the forthcoming EU Strategy on adaptation to climate\u000a      change. The project has been cited in recent communications from the EC on\u000a      a European Adaptation Strategy, who note that: \"Building upon the\u000a        success of its pilot project `Adaptation strategies for European\u000a        cities', the Commission will continue to promote urban adaptation\u000a        strategies\" [8], with Dr Carter appointed as an international expert\u000a      to support the Committee of the Regions on their submission to the EC on\u000a      the EU Adaptation Strategy.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of Manchester (UoM) has enhanced\u000a      capacity for assessing and responding to climate change impacts and risks\u000a      in urban areas, by moving from basic research around user requirements to\u000a      the development of scaleable decision support tools.

It was undertaken by researchers within the Architecture and\u000a      Planning discipline at UoM: Professor John Handley (1999-2010, now\u000a      Emeritus); Professor Simon Guy (2005-); Dr Jeremy Carter (Research Fellow,\u000a      2004-); Dr Gina Cavan (2009-2012); Dr Susannah Gill (2003-2007, now\u000a      visiting); and Richard Kingston (Senior Lecturer, 2003-). The research has\u000a      benefited from linkages across UoM disciplines, including Geography (Dr\u000a      Sarah Lindley), Engineering (Professor Geoff Levermore) and Life Sciences\u000a      (Dr Roland Ennos).\u000a    Central to this work is a core of interdisciplinary research on the ways\u000a      in which urbanisation modifies local climates, and the associated\u000a      implications for urban planning and development [F]. Specifically, the\u000a      research models how urbanisation modifies the natural environment by\u000a      increasing the capacity for heat storage and accelerating surface water\u000a      runoff. This framework is then applied to the context of rapid global\u000a      climate change and its potential impacts on cities, a concern raised by\u000a      the International Governmental Panel on Climate Change and the UK\u000a      Government `Adaptation Sub-Committee'. The research was tested thoroughly\u000a      within the Adaptation Strategies for Climate Change in the Urban\u000a        Environment (ASCCUE) project (2003-2006, EPSRC, &#163;432k) and led by\u000a      Professor Handley. ASCCUE provided the first integrated assessment of\u000a      climate change impacts and adaptation in UK urban areas.

The evaluation PhD project was\u000a      founded on the challenges\u000a      faced by organisations in evaluating the impact of regeneration\u000a      projects\/programmes. It identified the\u000a      lack of social indicators, and focus on economic indicators for\u000a      measurement of regeneration\u000a      projects\/programmes. Evaluation was mostly driven by funders or political\u000a      interests, and very rarely\u000a      captured long-term impact of the projects\/programmes.\u000a    The RAE2008 funded PhD research in Community-based FM reviewed existing\u000a      conceptual and\u000a      theoretical models of FM in the community, and developed a new guidance\u000a      for organisations in this\u000a      sector.

The niche research\u000a      work has been extremely successful in attracting funding at national and\u000a      international levels to solve industrial challenges, a trend which looks\u000a      set to continue.\u000a    The hygienic safety issue in the food industry for example [ref 4], has\u000a      proven that stainless steel switches eliminate the danger of food\u000a      contamination where there is a possibility of plastic switches being\u000a      smashed and entering the food chain. The use of stainless steel switches,\u000a      2012, allows them to be robust and provides them with the ability to\u000a      withstand harsh environments (e.g. temperature, ingress and high pressure\u000a      steam cleaning). This has enabled Mechan Controls PLC to develop\u000a      innovative products which have been commercially successful 2012-2013,\u000a      considerably raising their international market income and attracting\u000a      further investment partners. This has resulted in a fully deployed sensor\u000a      system in Proseal food machines, Alton Towers Fairground Safety, London\u000a      Eye carriages and Japanese rail. Since 2013, the company has sold 2,072\u000a      units of the Magnasave Safety product (product code MS8-SS-21-DC-05M) with\u000a      total revenue of &#163;103,270.\u000a    The success of the product particularly in the food industry has been a\u000a      result of the significant benefits it affords. Namely, the use of\u000a      stainless steel has a positive environmental impact since it reduces\u000a      waste, enables greater product shelf-life and reduces manufacturing\u000a      down-time resulting from damaged switches which contaminate food products.\u000a      Furthermore, the reduced down-time enhances overall productivity, saves\u000a      energy and ensures supply chain reliability, along with continued\u000a      affordability to customers.\u000a    The Technical Director of Mechan Controls PLC states: \"The success of\u000a        the research was tremendous for our core business and now the safety\u000a        standards are calling for greater integrity in the safety provision,\u000a        which is pushing the whole safety market, especially non-contact\u000a        devices, for high value products that have greater complexity and\u000a        reliability. This will certainly put Mechan products to the forefront of\u000a        any competitor markets\".\u000a    Continuing from the success of work in the food industry, work with\u000a      Animalia and Nortura in Norway has led to the application of our unique\u000a      sensor platform, 2011-2013, to replace a current industry gold standard,\u000a      the EZ Driploss Test, for meat quality. The current test is manual,\u000a      requiring a cut of meat and a 24 hour period to assess the quality; our\u000a      system, developed in 2012, can reproduce this in a 20 minute time period.\u000a      Currently the system is undergoing industrial trials in Norway by\u000a      Animalia, and has significantly improved their capacity to test meat\u000a      quality at various points in the meat processing chain which has allowed\u000a      them to identify areas of improvement. Of particular importance is water\u000a      loss from meat as it impacts on tenderness and saleable value; for every\u000a      1% of water lost in a single Nortura processing plant it is estimated to\u000a      cost approx. &#8364;100,000 per day.\u000a    The Senior Research Scientist at SINTEF states: \"The sensor system\u000a        developed at LJMU has proven to be ideal for the meat industry and looks\u000a        set to become the new gold standard for meat quality indication which\u000a        will help inform meat processing improvements and ensure a high standard\u000a        of meat being delivered to consumers\".\u000a    Applying the developed sensing expertise to other sectors, a significant\u000a      example has been the water industry, 2011-2013. Current analytical\u000a      techniques require the attendance of a technician to acquire water samples\u000a      for off-site laboratory analysis. This approach has a significant\u000a      disadvantage &#8212; the sample taken represents only the condition of the\u000a      sample at the time of sampling or testing. It is a snap-shot. Online based\u000a      sensors are coming to the mark, but the cost of such sensors is high and\u000a      the range of measurable parameters is limited. The Technology Development\u000a      Manager of United Utilities said: \"The developed real time\u000a        non-invasive electromagnetic wave sensors by LJMU have certainly helped\u000a        us in determining the quality of water with consistency and high\u000a        repeatability in real time without the need for the biological and\u000a        chemical laboratory testing.\" The importance of such sensors is\u000a      underlined by the EU Water Framework Directive, which regulates the\u000a      permissible contaminant levels in water; failure to comply results in\u000a      significant financial penalty.\u000a    Our novel sensor platform was also adapted, 2011, to study activated\u000a      carbon in gas masks, successfully resulting in the only automated method\u000a      for monitoring activated carbon residual life. The Technology Development\u000a      Manager of dstl said: \"The success of such a sensor has certainly\u000a        reduced the time taken for the conventional chemical test to a few\u000a        minutes, as verified by a 9 month study. The work has resulted in\u000a        significant transfer of knowledge from LJMU, and we are adopting such\u000a        sensor techniques in our activities at Porton Down\". The UK has in\u000a      excess of 200,000 active military personnel, a considerable number of whom\u000a      will require the use of a gas mask during active duty. The current policy\u000a      is to exchange gas masks based on a fixed time interval which does not\u000a      consider actual use. This policy leads to significant waste as masks are\u000a      often replaced without being used. However there is the possibility that\u000a      some masks become contaminated and are therefore rendered useless prior to\u000a      this fixed replacement interval. Therefore, the impact of this research is\u000a      a significant cost saving in needless replacement of gas masks, in\u000a      addition to potentially saving the lives of personnel equipped with\u000a      contaminated masks.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Sensors and on-line monitoring systems have clear benefits for various\u000a      sectors including water utilities, food, health, safety and defense.\u000a      Current approaches include optical, acoustic, mechanical, electrical and\u000a      bio sensors, however they often suffer from low reliability, sensitivity\u000a      and accuracy, combined with infrequent measurements and high cost, all of\u000a      which hinders their industrial application.

Although uptake of sensors by industry has increased\u000a      significantly there remains a number of hindrances which include: failure\u000a      to match industrial requirements; poor links between available sensor\u000a      technologies and quality regulations; verification schemes do not\u000a      sufficiently match industrial practices; challenge of managing large data\u000a      quantities and translating them into meaningful information for\u000a      operational processes. To address these issues, our approach has been to\u000a      develop a novel real-time non-invasive sensor platform based on\u000a      electromagnetic waves. This platform operates at variable frequencies, and\u000a      can be tuned to suit the industrial requirements based upon cross-sector\u000a      application. This case study outlines examples of these applications,\u000a      namely from the water, food and defence sectors.\u000a    \u000a      \u000aWater quality: Since 2011, Korostynska (EU research Fellow),\u000a        Mason (Reader) and Al-Shamma'a (BEST Director) have developed a unique\u000a        sensor for water quality monitoring meeting the demands of the EU Water\u000a        Framework Directive. The sensor platform [ref 1 and 2] has the\u000a        capability to perform real-time assessment at point-of-source locations\u000a        without the need for the biological and chemical laboratory use. The\u000a        sensor has the capability of measuring the water's physical\u000a        characteristics (e.g. pH, temperature, conductivity) and chemical\u000a        parameters (e.g. oxygen, alkalinity, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds)\u000a        efficiently and reliably. The research was funded via the EU FP7\u000a        programme (grant 1 in [6]) in collaboration with United Utilities.\u000a        Associated work in 2012, supported by the TSB and led by Al-Shamma'a and\u000a        Shaw (Reader), resulted in the development of a non-invasive hybrid\u000a        sensor (acoustic and electromagnetic wave) for the detection of water\u000a        leaks in underground networked water pipes. This project was led by\u000a        Balfour Beatty (grant 2 in [6]). This project covers the design,\u000a        development and commercialisation of an innovative internal leak\u000a        detection and condition assessment system for use within both potable\u000a        water and dirty water pipework networks. JD7, a UK based pipeline\u000a        inspection company, is currently testing and evaluating the sensor for\u000a        worldwide exploitation. This success has led to further international\u000a        collaboration with RIKEN-Japan, funded by the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese\u000a        foundation (grant 3 in [6]) to develop a non-invasive sensor meeting the\u000a        needs of the water industry, particularly in respect of monitoring\u000a        nuclear contamination.\u000a      \u000aFood quality: In 2012, Al-Shamma'a and Mason were awarded funds\u000a        by the Norwegian Research Council (grant 4 in [6]) to develop, for the\u000a        first time, a non-invasive sensor to be deployed in the food industry\u000a        for real-time quality control. No previous research and development or\u000a        commercial sensor system has been able to measure water holding\u000a        capacity, tenderness, foreign objects or bacterial contamination in real\u000a        time at low cost and with accuracy that makes its implementation\u000a        acceptable to the food industry. Working in collaboration with food\u000a        companies from Norway (Animalia and Nortura) and Spain (Faccsa and\u000a        CICAP), this project has been focussed towards improving the quality of\u000a        meat sold in supermarkets by determining tenderness, in addition to\u000a        detection of foreign objects, including bacteria. A particularly\u000a        important development of this work has been to reduce the time required\u000a        for the current gold standard of quality control (i.e. the EZ Driploss\u000a        Test) from 24-hours to just 20 minutes.\u000a      \u000aFood safety: There are various types of non-contact safety\u000a        switches available in the market however, there is unmet demand for an\u000a        electronic stainless steel enclosed non-contact safety interlock\u000a        switches for use in harsh environments and high pressure wash down\u000a        areas. Research at the Institute 2011-2013, covered the design,\u000a        simulation and prototype demonstrator of various safety switches\u000a        magnetic sensors, in collaboration with Mechan Control resulted in the\u000a        development of frequency operated non-contact stainless steel switch and\u000a        actuator for the food industry [ref 4] and (grant 5 in [6]).\u000a        Furthermore, by analysing the material composition of the sensor\u000a        enclosure, it was found that non-magnetic 316 stainless steel has almost\u000a        zero carbon content and a specific percentage of Nickel, which aids\u000a        transmission and propagation of the particular frequency signal between\u000a        switch and actuator.\u000a      \u000aDefence structure integrity: A team comprising of Al-Shamma'a\u000a        and Mason were awarded a research contract 2009-2012 by the UK Defence\u000a        Science &amp; Technology Laboratory (dstl) to develop a system for\u000a        determination of filter residual life in gas masks (grant 6 in [6]). The\u000a        team developed for the first time a sensing method which could\u000a        non-invasively determine the age of an activated carbon product [ref 5].\u000a        The success led to a further award (grant 7 in [6]), led by Mason and\u000a        Al-Shamma'a, to assess the potential of the sensing platform for\u000a        structural health monitoring in military vehicles. Furthermore, the\u000a        researchers are currently collaborating with Redrow, in applying similar\u000a        sensors in the construction industry.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31061","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    UoN's innovative PCM alternative to conventional air conditioning has\u000a      delivered a range of economic and environmental benefits since its\u000a      successful commercialisation in 2008.\u000a    Backed by a patent application [4.1], the technology was licensed to\u000a      Monodraught Ltd, resulting in the launch of COOL-PHASE&#174; (Figure 1).

Customers commented that they\u000a      found the system to be \"effective, sustainable and economically viable\"\u000a      and delivering \"a marked improvement in terms of temperature\" [4.3].\u000a\u000aFigure 2: Two Cool-Phase units mounted on the ceiling of an ICT suite in the University of East London\u000a\u000a    Analysis of system performance in the 180m2 ICT suite shown in\u000a      Figure 2 was carried out by building simulation specialists. Results\u000a      indicated that the installation of just two COOL-PHASE&#174; units in place of\u000a      conventional air conditioning would deliver financial savings of more than\u000a      26 per cent (approximately &#163;10,000) and CO2 savings of 12.8\u000a      tonnes over the anticipated system lifespan of 20 years [4.3].\u000a    COOL-PHASE&#174; was also installed in a particular \"problem\" room in the Owen\u000a      Building at Sheffield Hallam University &#8212; a 90-person teaching room on the\u000a      tenth floor that consistently exhibited poor air quality and high\u000a      temperatures. The room had no mechanical ventilation and was fitted with\u000a      opening windows to one side; but due to the height of the building these\u000a      were restricted to a 100mm maximum opening, limiting the effectiveness of\u000a      natural ventilation. In November 2009 the University's Estates Department\u000a      initiated environmental checks. The temperatures were consistently\u000a      recorded at 25&#186;C at a time when November's outside temperatures were\u000a      reaching only 5&#186;C. COOL-PHASE&#174; was installed in March 2012 and Lee Allen,\u000a      Building Services Engineer in the Sheffield Hallam University Estate\u000a      Department said, \"We monitored throughout the late March warm spell and\u000a      recorded a room temperature peak of 23&#186;C when outside temperatures were\u000a      hovering around 21&#186;C. We were very impressed with this performance\u000a      compared to the 25&#186;C internal room temperatures we were experiencing in\u000a      November\". [4.4]\u000a    The contribution COOL-PHASE&#174; has made to industry was recognised by the\u000a      Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE), which named\u000a      the system 2012's Energy-Using Product of the Year [4.5].

Recently, COOL-PHASE&#174; won an\u000a      IMPAX Ashden Award for Energy Innovation, which is a widely recognized\u000a      sustainability award, due to its low energy requirements. The product\u000a      consumes 90% less energy compared to alternatives on the market.\u000a      Commenting for Ashden, the awards judging panel remarks: \"This is a\u000a      ground-breaking innovation from an established business that has built up\u000a      a reputation for its long term commitment to sustainable buildings in the\u000a      UK.

A\u000a      simple way to satisfy these would be to incorporate concrete beams within\u000a      a structure, exploiting the effect of night cooling to discharge heat\u000a      stored in the thermal mass during the day. However, this solution is\u000a      unsuitable for retrofit in existing buildings, which is where the greatest\u000a      energy saving potential lies.\u000a    In the late 1990s, recognising the need for alternatives to conventional\u000a      air conditioning, researchers at the University of Nottingham (UoN) began\u000a      work to reduce energy consumption and avoid the use of refrigerant\u000a      chemicals in potential systems. Dr David Etheridge (Associate Professor,\u000a      University of Nottingham, 1997 - 2010) performed the original research on\u000a      natural ventilation [2.1, 2.2] and led the team, with other key members\u000a      including Visiting Professor David Reay (appointed honorary professor,\u000a      University of Nottingham, 1994 &#8212; present) and Professor Saffa Riffat\u000a      (Chair in Sustainable Energy, University of Nottingham, 1992 &#8212; present) to\u000a      investigate the potential for combining natural ventilation with\u000a      phase-change materials (PCM) within a retrofittable unit to increase the\u000a      effective thermal mass of a building (EPSRC GR\/R21639\/01).\u000a    PCMs store energy in the form of latent heat and are more efficient than\u000a      concrete, typically achieving the same heat storage with just four per\u000a      cent of the mass. During the day heat is transferred to the PCM, \"melting\"\u000a      it and reducing the temperature of the room; whilst at night heat is\u000a      extracted from the PCM, \"solidifying it\".\u000a    Researchers faced several challenges in the process of developing the\u000a      system, which was supported through the use of a new theoretical model\u000a      [2.3]. The initial idea was to use PCM in conjunction with heat pipes and\u000a      a fan to make the system more effective. Heat pipes have the advantage of\u000a      offering high heat transfer rates and are easy to maintain. The team also\u000a      needed to find a way of making them reversible, meaning they would operate\u000a      in a horizontal position.\u000a    Intelligent controls were designed to run this with minimal energy\u000a      consumption. To allow for the expansion and contraction that occurs during\u000a      the operating cycle, the system needed to be housed in a way that enabled\u000a      heat transfer with the air in the room but without it coming into direct\u000a      contact, which could result in air contamination. Lastly, the final\u000a      product needed to be suitable for manufacturing at a cost that would rival\u000a      or outperform conventional mass-produced air conditioning units [2.4].\u000a    Enthused by the potential of the technology, UoN liaised with industry to\u000a      gain commercial expertise in product design and manufacture, as well as\u000a      specialist input into how the research could be disseminated and marketed.\u000a      Extensive research and testing resulted in the production of a\u000a      demonstration system, using heat pipes embedded in a PCM with a fan to\u000a      provide the necessary air movement.\u000a    Taking place from 2002 to 2004, a second stage of development refined the\u000a      technology and developed two units for field trials. One was tested in the\u000a      David Wilson Eco-House on the UoN campus and the other was tested\u000a      externally. These trials demonstrated that the system could maintain a set\u000a      temperature with the same effectiveness as an air conditioning unit [2.5].\u000a      Following from this proof of fitness-for-purpose the team proceeded with\u000a      their commercial exploitation plans.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31062","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The technology developed as a result of the University of Nottingham's\u000a      research into the use of natural lighting and ventilation has been\u000a      employed in the design of low-carbon, low-energy buildings both in the UK\u000a      and overseas, delivering economic, environmental and societal benefits.\u000a      The technology developed by the University of Nottingham was licensed to\u000a      Monodraught Ltd and 745 units of Sola-Vent were installed between 2008 and\u000a      2012 in domestic and commercial buildings in the UK [4.1].\u000a    For example, the Newcastle-Under-Lyme College (NUL) installed 21\u000a      Sola-Vent units as part of its &#163;60M investment in a new Construction\u000a      Skills and Technology Centre for its 3,000 A-Level students in 2008.

As a result, Monodraught now has\u000a      in-house dynamic thermal modelling capabilities and its own ventilation\u000a      testing system to determine the performance of existing and new products\u000a      [4.5, 4.6].\u000a    The software, named Performance Components was developed with Integrated\u000a      Environmental Solutions Ltd, and delivers optimised energy savings in\u000a      design.

In the late 1990s Dr\u000a      Shao and Professor Riffat (Professor of Sustainable Energy, University of\u000a      Nottingham 1992 - present) published research into sunpipes and solar\u000a      chimneys, proposing the idea of integrating them into a single system. The\u000a      hypothesis was that if a light pipe is put in a larger duct, the annular\u000a      space surrounding the light pipe can facilitate natural ventilation. The\u000a      reflective liner inside a light pipe usually has a high reflectance for\u000a      visible light, but is less reflective in the infrared region of incoming\u000a      solar radiation. Absorption of this infrared radiation by the wall of a\u000a      light pipe will heat up the air in the annular space to cause a stack\u000a      effect (buoyancy), like a solar chimney. This ventilation can also be\u000a      driven by wind or by both wind and buoyancy. The proposed system would be\u000a      particularly suitable for the deep interiors of large buildings and\u000a      especially in schools, warehouses and other settings where security\u000a      considerations might limit the availability and effectiveness of\u000a      conventional forms of ventilation (e.g. windows).\u000a\u0009  \u000a\u0009  Figure 1: Illustration of Sola-Vent concept\u000a\u0009  \u000a    Together with six European partners, Shao and Riffat secured EU funding\u000a      to investigate the concept through the TRIPLESAVE project (G1). The\u000a      resulting work, carried out from February 1998 to July 2000, led to the\u000a      creation of an integrated light-vent pipe (LVP), with UoN responsible for\u000a      the conceptual design and testing of the prototype. UoN demonstrated that\u000a      the infrared part of the solar radiation could be absorbed by the surfaces\u000a      of the stack, transferring heat to the adjacent now more buoyant air, thus\u000a      facilitating natural ventilation extract while the visible light was\u000a      transmitted into the room below. The successful prototype was\u000a      commercialised by UK-based Monodraught Ltd, a recognised market leader in\u000a      low-carbon, low-energy products such as natural lighting, ventilation and\u000a      cooling systems; and was officially launched in 2002 as SunCatcher.\u000a    Building on this success, Shao and Riffat began to investigate the idea\u000a      of incorporating additional artificial lighting and ventilation, powered\u000a      by renewable resources, to produce a system that could be used in domestic\u000a      buildings. This strand of research, which began in 2004, had two key aims:\u000a      a) to use a photovoltaic-powered fan and spotlights, together with a\u000a      back-up battery and relevant control electronics, to allow for\u000a      controllable ventilation in hard-to-reach places where access to mains\u000a      power would require a complex installation [2.1]; and b) to facilitate\u000a      ventilation and lighting at night or in poor weather [2.2].\u000a    Key contributions to this work came from Riffat and Shao, who were\u000a      involved in the design and selection of the photovoltaic panel system\u000a      [2.3], and Dr Yuehong Su (Lecturer, 2005 - present), who developed an\u000a      experimental method to assess the ventilation rate and other performance\u000a      indicators through experimental and CFD studies [2.4].\u000a    Successful testing of a prototype system, developed with Monodraught and\u000a      using a DC fan duct (to allow active ventilation) aligned with a sunpipe,\u000a      led to subsequent commercialisation. Launched by Monodraught in 2005 as\u000a      Sola-Vent, the system won the Best Interior Product award at the 2006\u000a      Interbuild show, a major annual event for the UK construction industry.\u000a      Sola-Vent has received widespread uptake from 2008 onwards as described in\u000a      Section 4.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31063","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Creative Energy Homes project is unique among UK HEIs.

CEH is one\u000a      of the first projects in the UK to test the national standard for\u000a      zero-carbon housing delivery, the UK\u000a      Code for Sustainable Homes. The businesses sponsoring the project had\u000a      never designed or built\u000a      these types of homes before.

As part of the Climate Change Act 2008, the\u000a      Department of Energy and\u000a      Climate Change (DECC) introduced a target to reduce UK carbon emissions,\u000a      relative to 1990\u000a      levels, by 80 per cent by 2050.

Research revealed that achieving the\u000a      desired system\u000a      efficiency - or Coefficient of Performance (COP) &#8212; depended on careful\u000a      consideration of the\u000a      system as a whole, taking ground loops, domestic hot water system and\u000a      radiators, and system\u000a      operation into account [2.1]. The work was further developed to consider\u000a      the more economical\u000a      option of using piled concrete foundations as ground source heat\u000a      exchangers. The study\u000a      investigated temperature changes in the foundation piles and the\u000a      surrounding ground as well as\u000a      operational performance of the heat pump itself. Temperature changes\u000a      observed in the test plot\u000a      were compared with natural temperature variations in the ground due to the\u000a      seasonal climatic\u000a      influence.

The construction industry has become increasingly\u000a      concerned about\u000a      understanding the impact of buildings as different stakeholders in the\u000a      industry are shifting their\u000a      focus towards declaration of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon\u000a      footprints of\u000a      buildings, with an ultimate goal to become carbon neutral or even carbon\u000a      positive.\u000a    2.2 Current research gaps and how this research addresses them:\u000a      Calculating emissions from\u000a      the construction process and building use is a relatively new concern for\u000a      the construction industry\u000a      and published sources are limited. There are a number of carbon management\u000a      tools available,\u000a      however, not many of them apply the life cycle approach and few are\u000a      suitable for use by the\u000a      construction industry, mainly due to their different calculation\u000a      methodology and region specific\u000a      datasets. There is no viable standard toolkit.\u000a    The research reported in this case study establishes two frameworks. The\u000a      first framework\u000a      proposes an assimilation methodology and toolkit with data, scope and\u000a      boundary protocols to allow\u000a      comparison of design scenarios within building type groups. The second\u000a      framework offers a\u000a      predictive modelling toolkit designed to help organisations with large\u000a      property portfolios to reduce\u000a      their carbon emissions. The frameworks support the formulation of\u000a      environmental impact reduction\u000a      strategies throughout the design, construction and management of buildings\u000a      and support life cycle\u000a      thinking in terms of design life, reuse and recycling necessary for\u000a      optimising sustainability in the\u000a      built environment.\u000a    The Centre for Architectural Research in the Lincoln School of\u000a      Architecture has developed the\u000a      methodologies, frameworks and toolkits in partnership with industrial\u000a      partners. They provide the\u000a      construction industry with consistent approaches in order that benchmarks\u000a      can be established and\u000a      proposed design and buildings may be more readily compared and analysed.\u000a      The research has\u000a      inspired audiences to become increasingly aware of their carbon footprint,\u000a      and to understand the\u000a      changes that need to be made to our built environment to achieve a more\u000a      sustainable future.\u000a    2.3 Research objectives and aims\u000a    \u000a      To propose calculation methodologies and data collection procedures to\u000a        ensure uniformity,\u000a        consistency, transparency and accuracy in estimation of the carbon\u000a        emissions of buildings.\u000a      To enable design teams and facility managers to create and maintain\u000a        low emission buildings\u000a        across the whole life cycle of buildings.\u000a      To enable best value cost benefit decision making alongside low\u000a        carbon and other sustainability\u000a        drivers.\u000a    \u000a    2.4 Research methodology: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a\u000a      systematic approach to manage\u000a      the potential environmental impacts of products and service systems. This\u000a      philosophy towards\u000a      meeting changing needs and mitigating risks can be compared to the\u000a      research methodology of\u000a      experiential learning. Precedent for this form of research design\u000a      is rooted in the development of\u000a      Change Theory in which the researcher is engaged in a reflective\u000a      study of professional practice\u000a      within a system, in the case for this impact case study, large\u000a      architectural practices and\u000a      organisations with large property portfolios. This research is also linked\u000a      to the idea of pragmatic\u000a      Action Research, which would be apparent in the implementation of\u000a      the change to the collaborating\u000a      professional practices that would be brought about by wide-scale adoption\u000a      of good practice.\u000a    2.5 Key research findings: The research has produced a family of\u000a      carbon reduction management\u000a      tools.

In particular there have been:\u000d\u000a    Impacts on practitioners and professional services: Hill Holt Wood\u000d\u000a      Social Enterprise, acting as\u000d\u000a      the industrial partner for the research project, directly benefited from\u000d\u000a      the research by gaining skills\u000d\u000a      and expertise to establish a sustainable design and construction arm for\u000d\u000a      the organisation\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tk-kNtEBDUo).\u000d\u000a      Simons Design, part of the Simons Group, a\u000d\u000a      major construction company in the region, directly benefited from the\u000d\u000a      research through its\u000d\u000a      collaborative work with the research programme which enabled them to be\u000d\u000a      recognised as a\u000d\u000a      pioneer in sustainable construction practice. This visibility resulted in\u000d\u000a      the company winning\u000d\u000a      prestigious contracts, and in addition the practice was awarded \"Business\u000d\u000a      in the Community East\u000d\u000a      Midlands Region Prohelp Award 2007\" for their pro bono work through the\u000d\u000a      Prohelp scheme for\u000d\u000a      their involvement in a number of projects, the most significant of which\u000d\u000a      was the Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Community Building. In addition, a wide range of architectural practices,\u000d\u000a      planners, construction\u000d\u000a      companies, suppliers, manufactures, and local authorities benefited from\u000d\u000a      the research through\u000d\u000a      accessing its findings at different platforms including visits to the\u000d\u000a      building, workshops, conferences,\u000d\u000a      publications and press coverage.\u000d\u000a    Impact on raising awareness of the public: The research has\u000d\u000a      substantially raised the public\u000d\u000a      awareness and acceptance of the potential of sustainable planning and\u000d\u000a      development through a\u000d\u000a      wide &#8212; ranging programme of public events, talks, workshops and visits to\u000d\u000a      the building as outlined\u000d\u000a      below. It has also resulted in specific changes in policy makers'\u000d\u000a      awareness and behaviours\u000d\u000a      towards the role and potential of low carbon design in safeguarding the\u000d\u000a      environment. For example,\u000d\u000a      following the involvement of North Kesteven Council in the Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Community Building, the\u000d\u000a      Council commissioned social housing projects in the region built in\u000d\u000a      load-bearing straw-bale\u000d\u000a      construction (reference 1 in Section 3).\u000d\u000a    Impacts on the environment: The research has demonstrated\u000d\u000a      significant and quantifiable\u000d\u000a      impacts on the quality of built environment by highlighting the potential\u000d\u000a      of low impact\u000d\u000a      environmentally friendly buildings. The Sustainable Community Building has\u000d\u000a      been used as a\u000d\u000a      precedent at national and international levels to demonstrate the\u000d\u000a      practical application of low impact\u000d\u000a      construction techniques and design.

In response to the challenge of\u000d\u000a      climate change, the UK\u000d\u000a      has introduced new stringent codes and standards in order to reduce the\u000d\u000a      energy consumption of\u000d\u000a      buildings and to make them carbon neutral in future. The debates around\u000d\u000a      sustainability are\u000d\u000a      becoming increasingly sophisticated and there is recognition that\u000d\u000a      considering environmental\u000d\u000a      sustainability alone, without considering broader economic and social\u000d\u000a      contexts, is likely to frustrate\u000d\u000a      any attempts to achieve realistic levels of sustainable development.\u000d\u000a    2.2 Current research gaps and how this research addresses them:\u000d\u000a      Although the construction\u000d\u000a      industry is gradually moving towards more sustainable practices due to a\u000d\u000a      range of regulatory and\u000d\u000a      voluntary initiatives, there are both gaps in knowledge and shortcomings\u000d\u000a      in current practice that\u000d\u000a      need to be addressed. Crucially, a holistic approach to sustainability\u000d\u000a      that ensures that all\u000d\u000a      stakeholders work together towards common goals is missing. This research\u000d\u000a      supports the thesis\u000d\u000a      that such a holistic approach can be achieved only by addressing the\u000d\u000a      social, economic and\u000d\u000a      environmental aspects of sustainability simultaneously. It emphasizes the\u000d\u000a      necessity of the\u000d\u000a      collaboration of all stakeholders to quantify and interpret environmental\u000d\u000a      impacts of buildings\u000d\u000a      throughout the building lifecycle as a key indicator of responsible use of\u000d\u000a      resources and energy, and\u000d\u000a      offers an exemplar of this philosophy in practice. Among the main\u000d\u000a      objectives of the research are;\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      To identify the drivers for sustainability\u000d\u000a      To identify the content for sustainable buildings\u000d\u000a      To identify the process for development of sustainable buildings.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    2.3 Research methodology: This research has used an inductive\u000d\u000a      research methodology in order\u000d\u000a      to understand the factors influencing sustainability in the built\u000d\u000a      environment. This \"Action Research\"\u000d\u000a      approach is common in design-based applied disciplines as it is close to\u000d\u000a      the iterative approach\u000d\u000a      used in the design of buildings. The literature review has centred on\u000d\u000a      sustainability, life cycle\u000d\u000a      analysis and legislation in the UK.\u000d\u000a    2.4 Key research findings: The research findings are diverse and\u000d\u000a      address aspects of both\u000d\u000a      planning and development.

The KTP research\u000d\u000a      associate was Bryce Gilroy\u000d\u000a      Scott and the industrial supervisor was Nigel Lowthrop at Hill Holt Wood\u000d\u000a      (HHW) Social Enterprise\u000d\u000a      (www.hillholtwood.com). Students\u000d\u000a      of architecture at the Lincoln School of Architecture, through a\u000d\u000a      design competition under the supervision of Prof. Sodagar (2005-06),\u000d\u000a      contributed to the research\u000d\u000a      by creating the blueprint for the design of the building.

This was an international competition with\u000a      judges drawn from the\u000a      ranks of expert practitioners under the chairmanship of an academic. It is\u000a      now established as a\u000a      practitioner's handbook on building contracts. It has been observed by our\u000a      many informants that it\u000a      is not uncommon for a disputant, on arrival at the hearing of a dispute\u000a      with a copy of the book, to\u000a      notice that the other side as well as the tribunal also have copies on\u000a      their tables. The use of the\u000a      book as a key reference on hotly contested issues has now been\u000a      corroborated. In a review of the\u000a      book, Roger ter Haar QC (ter Haar 2010), a leading London Silk, compared\u000a      it favourably with\u000a      Keating on Construction Contracts, which has been revered for over\u000a      half a century as the\u000a      practitioner's \"bible\" on construction contracts.\u000a    Most of the research has been carried out with outreach activities\u000a      heavily subscribed to by\u000a      practitioners and policy makers. For example, the passing of the HGCRA was\u000a      greeted in the\u000a      construction industry with alarm because of Parliament's unprecedented\u000a      intervention into private\u000a      contracts and the imposition of what was perceived as an impossibly tight\u000a      timetable for the\u000a      resolution of complex construction disputes. This legislation sparked off\u000a      such a furore in the\u000a      construction industry that when our research team was invited by the\u000a      Society of Construction Law\u000a      to present the first ever survey into adjudication practice under the new\u000a      legislation, more than 200\u000a      practitioners attended. The presentation provoked extensive debate from\u000a      the floor. This event was\u000a      followed by a national conference in Wolverhampton on 20 November 2001 at\u000a      which more than\u000a      100 practitioners also attended. Leading practitioners were invited and\u000a      made presentations on\u000a      identified areas of controversy. This conference was so successful that it\u000a      attracted the attention of\u000a      the national Construction Press (e.g., Construction News of 13th\u000a      Dec 2001). Wolverhampton has\u000a      continued to be a centre of excellence for CPD on dispute resolution based\u000a      on internationally\u000a      leading research.\u000a    With funding from the EPSRC and collaboration from the universities of\u000a      Leeds and Reading,\u000a      Ndekugri's research has resulted in the establishment of FIDIC-NET, an\u000a      international network of\u000a      experts on, and users of, the FIDIC family of construction contracts. The\u000a      Network Steering\u000a      Committee included a former judge, representatives of FIDIC and\u000a      international contractors, the\u000a      academics and a Partner of Fenwick Elliott (a construction law firm\u000a      adjudged No. 1 in the UK for\u000a      many years). Four international workshops were run with participation from\u000a      engineers and lawyers\u000a      from many countries. The website developed as part of the project was\u000a      gradually populated with\u000a      articles, workshop reports and PowerPoint presentations prepared as part\u000a      of the activities of the\u000a      Network. On account of their determination that Ndekugri's research\u000a      offered solutions to some of\u000a      the problems often encountered in the procurement of infrastructure in\u000a      developing countries, the\u000a      Rome-based International Development Law Organisation (IDLO) invited\u000a      Ndekugri to develop and\u000a      deliver a training workshop on international contracts to engineers and\u000a      lawyers from developing\u000a      countries on 12-13 November 2012. The event received a score of 4.38 out\u000a      of 5 by delegates\u000a      (Evidence: Reference 9 &#8212; A Workshop Evaluation Report prepared by Val&#233;rie\u000a      Robert of IDLO).\u000a    The research into international contracts was also designed to achieve\u000a      impact simultaneously with\u000a      the research in three main ways. Firstly, representatives of organisations\u000a      with a say on the content\u000a      of international contracts were involved as part of the research steering\u000a      committee or workshop\u000a      presenters to highlight their positions on certain matters. For example,\u000a      membership of the original\u000a      research steering committee included international lawyers and\u000a      representatives of FIDIC and the\u000a      European International Contractors group. To get the position of the World\u000a      Bank and the other\u000a      Multilateral Development Banks the three most senior managers in the\u000a      Procurement Department of\u000a      the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development made presentations.\u000a      Secondly,\u000a      workshops were deliberately designed to stimulate debate. Thirdly, the\u000a      general membership of the\u000a      Network were sent newsletters highlighting the discussions at the\u000a      workshops and encouraged to\u000a      continue the debates using the Network's online discussion forum. The\u000a      debates stimulated by\u000a      FIDIC-NET informed subsequent amendments to the contract (Reference 8).\u000a      Edward Corbett of\u000a      Corbett &amp; Co, a leading firm of specialist international construction\u000a      lawyers provides testimony on\u000a      the continuing impact of FIDIC-NET whilst Peter Chapman may be contacted\u000a      to corroborate the\u000a      contribution of FIDIC-NET to best practice in the use of Dispute Boards.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research portfolio of the Construction Management Group included\u000a      construction law and\u000a      management of legal relationships for performing construction contracts.\u000a      Outputs in this area of\u000a      research have included peer-reviewed papers, textbooks and online\u000a      newsletters.

Research in categories (i) and (ii) was\u000a      carried out using legal\u000a      research methods whilst the third category involved the collection and\u000a      analysis of data from the\u000a      construction industry. Ndekugri's work has been agenda-setting in these\u000a      categories of research\u000a      (Ndekugri and Russell 2005, Ndekugri and Russell 2006, Ndekugri et al\u000a      2008, Morris and Ndekugri\u000a      2013, Ndekugri et al 2013).\u000a    UK standard forms of contract researched included the family of contracts\u000a      published by the Joint\u000a      Contracts Tribunal and the New Engineering Contract suite of contracts\u000a      promoted by the Institution\u000a      of Civil Engineers. Research on legislation has been limited to the\u000a      Arbitration Act 1996, the\u000a      Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (HGCRA) and the\u000a      Local Democracy,\u000a      Economic Development and Construction 2009 (which amends aspects of the\u000a      HGCRA). The aims\u000a      of such research have been: identification of the underlying policy\u000a      issues; critical examination of\u000a      the wording of the legislation aimed at presenting it in a way more\u000a      understandable to the\u000a      construction industry; and evaluation of the extent of achievement of the\u000a      underlying policy\u000a      objectives. Law reports on relevant court cases provided qualitative data\u000a      for critical analysis.\u000a    Research in the third category investigated contract management practice\u000a      from multiple\u000a      perspectives, including effect on relationships and costs, sources and\u000a      causes of disputes and\u000a      identification of best practice in contract administration and dispute\u000a      resolution. For example, the\u000a      timetable within which adjudications of construction disputes have to be\u000a      completed has been the\u000a      subject of the greatest controversy in respect of not only the uncertainty\u000a      in the wording of the\u000a      legislation but also the opaqueness and contradictions in judicial\u000a      pronouncements on the subject\u000a      (Morris and Ndekugri 2013). Survey and interview research strategies were\u000a      used in this prong of\u000a      the research, which contributed significantly to the publication of a\u000a      practice-based book co-authored\u000a      by Ndekugri and a director of a multinational contracts and dispute\u000a      resolution consulting\u000a      firm (Ndekugri and Rycroft 2009).\u000a    At the international level, use of the family of contracts (or their\u000a      derivatives) promoted by FIDIC, the\u000a      international federation of national associations of consulting engineers,\u000a      is the norm. Using focus\u000a      groups comprising leading practitioners, Ndekugri (jointly with Professor\u000a      Nigel Smith of Leeds and\u000a      Professor Will Hughes of Reading) has developed guidance on best practice\u000a      in the use of Dispute\u000a      Boards, which are mandatory for projects funded in part or wholly by the\u000a      World Bank and other\u000a      Multilateral Development Banks in developing countries (Ndekugri et al\u000a      2013). Many developing\u000a      countries are also legislating to provide business-friendly legal\u000a      environments for the procurement\u000a      of their infrastructure. A new strand of this area of research is aimed at\u000a      supporting such initiatives\u000a      with appropriate policy analysis. This research is already beginning to\u000a      bear fruit as a policy\u000a      analysis of Ghana's Alternative Disputes Act 2010 has already come to the\u000a      attention of the\u000a      Parliament of Ghana which is contemplating remedial legislation (Reference\u000a      1 on corroboration).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32550","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Knowledge Transfer Partnerships\u000a    Our work on the implementation of BIM for prefabrication led to a KTP\u000a      with Banro Holdings Ltd. which transformed the company's working practices\u000a      and aided it in increasing the number of projects they could handle,\u000a      whilst improving efficiency of prefabrication projects within the company.\u000a      The project was independently assessed as grade B (Very Good) by\u000a      reviewers.

Results from this KTP are already extremely positive and a new\u000a      sister company has been established based on the work undertaken (http:\/\/www.seeable.co.uk).\u000a      We have just won a new KTP to focus on the application of ICT to enhance\u000a      health and safety in the rail sector. This work will further bring\u000a      together our research in the areas of BIM, Augmented Reality and Health\u000a      and Safety.\u000a    Our expertise in the field of BIM is now having significant regional and\u000a      national impacts on the construction industry. In the last 24 months we\u000a      have operated a substantial number of Innovation Vouchers funded by the\u000a      TSB. These have assisted companies in developing BIM implementation\u000a      strategies. We have held conferences on BIM implementation (http:\/\/www.ciat.org.uk\/en\/media_centre\/news_and_events\/events.cfm\/freebimfree#.UmAidmTJEuc)\u000a      for the construction industry and Heesom now sits on several committees,\u000a      including the CIAT national BIM group and the Midlands BIM Hub. In\u000a      addition, the expertise derived from our research activities within the\u000a      field of BIM has led to an on-going collaboration with the Construction\u000a      Industry Training Board (CITB) and the National Construction College (NCC)\u000a      to deliver state-of-the-art seminars on the topic around the UK (for\u000a      example, see http:\/\/www.fmb.org.uk\/grow-your-business\/training\/green-building\/building-information-modelling)\u000a      Over 30 seminars have been delivered all over the UK to over 600\u000a      construction practitioners (Reference 3).\u000a    CPD and Training\u000a    Over 150 construction professionals have been trained through various CPD\u000a      programmes organised by the then UK West Midlands Centre for Constructing\u000a      Excellence (WMCCE), the University of Wolverhampton, the Council for the\u000a      Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) and the Abu Dhabi Police\u000a      Force, UAE (Reference 4).\u000a    Stimulation of Practitioner Debates\u000a    One of the principal ways of achieving this impact has been through\u000a      membership of key decision-making bodies in industry. For example, Oloke\u000a      has been a member of the ICE Health and Safety Expert Panel since 2005\u000a      (Reference 5), a role through which he participates in the work of several\u000a      practice sub-panels and contributes to topical issues (e.g. the on-going\u000a      consultation towards revision of the CDM Regulations). He is the current\u000a      Chairman of the ICE's Health and Safety Register Working Group, which has\u000a      the delegated authority of developing and promoting policies for the ICE\u000a      Construction Health and Safety Register. Practitioner debate has also been\u000a      stimulated by our team's contributions to workshops for practitioners.\u000a      Sometimes publications come to the attention of the professional\u000a      institutions and they are found important enough to warrant a Press\u000a      Release either to influence the practice of their members or stimulate\u000a      debate. Our work on corporate manslaughter exemplifies this type of\u000a      impact. The ICE found the outcomes of Ndekugri's study (Ndekugri 2013) so\u000a      instructive to consulting engineers that they issued a Press Release\u000a      bringing it to the attention of their members (Reference 6).\u000a    Contribution to Best Practice Guidelines\u000a    Our health and safety research has made a very important contribution to\u000a      the ICE in their development of guidance on best practice in health and\u000a      safety management, which is now available as a manual (Reference 7). Oloke\u000a      also contributed extensively to the development of the London 2012 Safety,\u000a      Environmental and Health Manual for the procurement of the infrastructure\u000a      for the 2012 London Olympics (Reference 8). Our work on delay analysis has\u000a      been incorporated by the International Association of Advances in Cost\u000a      Engineering into their practice guidance on forensic analysis of delay\u000a      (Reference 9).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The types of impact highlighted in this case study are: improved\u000a      effectiveness of workplace practices in relation to health and safety\u000a      management, time management and collaborative working; development of\u000a      resources to enhance professional practice; stimulation of practitioner\u000a      debate on the impact of new legislation on criminal liability for poor\u000a      management of health and safety; and improvement in turnover of SMEs\u000a      through ICT adoption.

In response to the\u000a      policy of accident prevention through risk assessment, competence and\u000a      cooperation as stated in the EU Directive 92\/57\/EEC on Temporary or Mobile\u000a      Construction Sites, which has been implemented as the CDM Regulations in\u000a      the UK, much of our effort has gone into models of safety factors,\u000a      competence and collaboration. For example, research led by Oloke, Hammond,\u000a      Suresh and Ankrah has produced various models of cost benefit analysis,\u000a      accident prevention and causal influences of upstream project features\u000a      (Manu et al 2013, Ikpe et al 2012). These models have\u000a      added significantly to knowledge that underpins preventative strategies at\u000a      the pre-construction stage of projects and accident analysis when\u000a      prevention fails.\u000a    Government passed legislation creating the offence of corporate\u000a      manslaughter for causing death at the workplace to respond to public\u000a      outcry about perceived laxity in the law in allowing business \"fat cats\"\u000a      to get away with \"murder\" through their activities. A prong of our health\u000a      and safety research involved analysis of the new legislation to inform all\u000a      stakeholders in the construction industry of the risks of a corporate\u000a      manslaughter conviction (Ndekugri 2013).\u000a    Time management Practice\u000a    Delayed completion of projects is one of the most protracted challenges\u000a      facing the construction industry. Not only do clients get their projects\u000a      late but they are also often embroiled in the most contentious and\u000a      expensive disputes as to which supply chain member should carry\u000a      responsibility for the inevitable substantial increase in project costs.\u000a      Our project time management research highlighted the multi-disciplinary\u000a      nature of time management (estimators, planners and construction project\u000a      managers) and shortcomings in planning practice (Ndekugri et al\u000a      2008, Braimah et al 2009). This research informed the parallel\u000a      research into ICT tools for project planning and collaboration (Zhou et\u000a        al 2012).\u000a    Advances in ICT Tools\u000a    Our track record in assisting the construction industry to adopt ICT\u000a      tools heralds back to the early 2000s. Initial work on the use of 4D\u000a      modelling for space planning under a collaborative EPSRC grant paved the\u000a      way for much further research as the construction industry moved forward\u000a      towards BIM (http:\/\/core.kmi.open.ac.uk\/display\/1932308).\u000a      Subsequent research bought together new technologies, including\u000a      Geographical Information Systems, with Health and Safety for the\u000a      construction industry (Manase et al 2011) and collaborative\u000a      working. Implementation of BIM has been a natural progression. Building on\u000a      previous work in the field of 3D and 4D modelling of construction\u000a      processes, the ICT research team have developed new approaches to simulate\u000a      construction processes using distributed methodologies (Zhou et al.\u000a      2012). This work developed a completely new software platform to allow\u000a      distributed 4D planning in an immersive environment (http:\/\/wlv.openrepository.com\/wlv\/handle\/2436\/98506).\u000a      This has subsequently led to the integration of new approaches to\u000a      visualising BIM data through Augmented Reality. The integration of our\u000a      advanced ICT research with research into health and safety, project\u000a      planning practice and collaboration has been responsible for our\u000a      outstanding impact on technology adoption.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35126","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    One of the key routes to impact has been BIM Academy (http:\/\/www.BIMacademy.ac.uk\u000a      ) formed in\u000a      2010 in joint venture with Ryder Architecture.

This has been\u000a      referred to in the USA\u000a      as Integrated Project Delivery (IPD). The Unit has combined its\u000a      strengths in BIM and IPD to a point\u000a      where we are recognised as a: \"leader in BIM-related research and\u000a        development\" (Source 1).\u000a    The first paper presented, `The Impact of Market and Supply\u000a      Configurations ...' (Reference 1) was\u000a      published following three-year EPSRC projects (GR\/R20151\/01 and\u000a      GR\/R20168\/01; Greenwood\u000a      was PI and CI, respectively) with 15 industry partners. Based upon\u000a      extensive data collection from\u000a      its participants, this project was the first to generate empirical data\u000a      about the transaction costs of\u000a      the traditional construction process, thereby providing evidence of waste\u000a      and the metrics for\u000a      evaluation of efficiency improvements.\u000a    Further research by Greenwood under a DTI Partners in Innovation\u000a      grant (DTI Pii 39-3-670)\u000a      examined 50 construction projects in a three-year longitudinal study to\u000a      examine whether project\u000a      performance had been improved through partnering. Performance data from\u000a      the partnered projects\u000a      were benchmarked against traditionally procured examples. The project\u000a      report was produced in\u000a      digital format and endorsed by Sir Michael Latham (Source 2). The\u000a      article with Yates (Reference\u000a        2) concluded that the findings of this study provide rare empirical\u000a      evidence for Williamson's\u000a      theoretical assertions based on Transaction Cost Analysis.\u000a    The impact of collaborative working on project performance\u000a      underlies many of the reform agendas\u000a      in UK Construction, though evidence had been limited and\/or anecdotal. The\u000a      work of Greenwood\u000a      and Wu (Reference 3) produced empirical evidence from 44 projects.\u000a      Associations were found\u000a      between the disaggregated components of collaboration and performance.\u000a      Besides its theoretical\u000a      contribution, the work has practical recommendation for project\u000a      performance improvements.\u000a    The advent of BIM brought a renewed emphasis on project collaboration and\u000a      IPD. However, this\u000a      presents challenges, as highlighted in the work by Shafiq et al. (Reference\u000a        4). Advances in\u000a      collaborative practices, particularly information sharing (e.g. through\u000a      extranets) are now technically\u000a      challenged by the sheer extent and diversity of information available.\u000a      Solutions have been\u000a      borrowed from manufacturing industry in the form of model collaboration\u000a      systems (MCSs). A\u000a      comprehensive solution is yet to be realised but this research offers a\u000a      blueprint for progress.\u000a    The paper by Lockley et al (Reference 5) investigated issues\u000a      around sharing and exchange of\u000a      data in IFC format (IFC is an international standard format for data\u000a      exchange). Most BIM software\u000a      vendors have claimed that their products fully support IFC. The reported\u000a      work tested these\u000a      assertions experimentally, subjecting 14 common BIM tools to tests. It\u000a      revealed a dramatic failure,\u000a      with the commercial BIM tools showing limited capability to import\/export\u000a      IFC geometries. The test\u000a      model and results have been circulated to the companies concerned and to\u000a      experts in the area,\u000a      and their observations, as well as results of any further tests will be\u000a      made publicly available.\u000a    The eXtensible Building Information Management Toolkit (xBIM) (Reference\u000a        6) (used as a testing\u000a      device in the previously-referenced study) can solve these problems.\u000a      Authored in C# \/ C++ and\u000a      implemented on the .NET platform, xBIM is a free, open-source, toolkit,\u000a      released in 2012, that\u000a      allows developers to create, read and view BIM Models in IFC format and\u000a      develop functional `add-ins'\u000a      for commercial BIM tools.

Following the evaluation of VR potential and its uptake\u000d\u000a      internationally in construction (Reference 1) the group began to\u000d\u000a      engage with developers to maximise the potential of projects. An example\u000d\u000a      is The Stephenson Quarter, a `key regeneration project in the\u000d\u000a      heart of Newcastle'. The developer Silverlink Holdings Ltd. engaged the\u000d\u000a      unit's Virtual Reality and Visualisation Group to create a virtual model\u000d\u000a      of the scheme, since: \" it has strategic links with Central Station,\u000d\u000a        the historic core and the stylish Quayside -it was absolutely vital that\u000d\u000a        we were able to demonstrate connectivity to these key areas and to\u000d\u000a        communicate that message to different audiences.\" Following the\u000d\u000a      work, the Director of Silverlink Properties reported that: \"The project\u000d\u000a        through Northumbria University not only delivered that objective, it\u000d\u000a        provided a platform for many other uses from design development and\u000d\u000a        improvement through to promotion and marketing.\" (Source 1).\u000d\u000a    Aiding council's planning processes: Our most significant route to\u000d\u000a      impact came from the formation of Virtual NewcastleGateshead (VNG)\u000d\u000a      Partnership and the creation of the VNG City Model (both in 2009). In\u000d\u000a      doing so, a great deal of research was conducted into the optimum\u000d\u000a      organisational structure of VNG (Reference 2) and attention paid to\u000d\u000a      ensure its sustainability (Reference 3 ). The model now covers over\u000d\u000a      100km2 and compared with established practices, represents an effective\u000d\u000a      stakeholder communication tool and an efficient way of examining the wider\u000d\u000a      implications of planning applications. As a result, it has shaped and\u000d\u000a      improved the planning processes of both councils. For example, the\u000d\u000a      methodology of view impact assessment available with the\u000d\u000a      VNG model has been adopted by the two municipalities, and has played a\u000d\u000a      critical role in harmonising the planning processes of both. As a result,\u000d\u000a      explicit recommendations for use of VNG have been included in Gateshead\u000d\u000a      and Newcastle Councils' Urban Design Supplementary Planning Documents.\u000d\u000a      To quote from the NewcastleGateshead Urban Core Area Action Plan (2011):\u000d\u000a      \"(VNG) has been established to provide developers with the opportunity\u000d\u000a        for an accurate and effective view impact analysis to be undertaken of\u000d\u000a        new development set within the context of the Urban Core and its views.\u000d\u000a        Both Councils recognise this methodology of view impact assessment as\u000d\u000a        being of sufficient accuracy for planning application purposes\".

In a report produced by Gateshead\u000d\u000a      Council (2011) its Urban Design Officer stated that VNG has provided: \"developers\u000a        and architects with services which enabled their proposals to be more\u000d\u000a        accurately and efficiently developed and assessed within their urban\u000d\u000a        context\". The report continues that benefits include much greater\u000d\u000a      accuracy and efficiency for all those involved in planning\u000d\u000a      decision-making, by way of greater certainty, quicker decisions, and\u000d\u000a      resultant significant time and cost savings. Benefits exist for: \" all\u000d\u000a        stakeholders, including developers, architects, planning authorities and\u000d\u000a        their elected members, statutory consultees, marketing agents, potential\u000d\u000a        occupiers, and the wider general public\" (all citations from Source\u000a        3).\u000d\u000a    Supporting professional practice through 3-Dimensional modelling and\u000d\u000a        Visualisation: VNG has supported 12 major urban development projects\u000d\u000a      (and many smaller schemes) by: \" assisting architects and visualizers\u000d\u000a        to produce accurate imagery to help their clients, stakeholders and\u000d\u000a        other interested parties progress a project through the design\u000d\u000a        development and planning process.\" (Source 4) The model has\u000d\u000a      been systematically introduced to over 30 client organisations and over 50\u000d\u000a      architectural practices via strategic partnerships with RIBA and\u000d\u000a      Northern Architecture, and has informed the design of Gateshead's most\u000d\u000a      significant recent projects, including Trinity Square and\u000d\u000a      Gateshead's quayside developments.\u000d\u000a    Ideally, city models should permit integration with applications that\u000d\u000a      assist decision-makers in understanding the performance characteristics,\u000d\u000a      as well as visual aspects of urban spaces. Our work is concerned with\u000d\u000a      understanding how best to increase user engagement and develop VNG to\u000d\u000a      support multi-system modelling, with applications such as transport,\u000d\u000a      energy, pedestrian and heritage visualisations (Reference 3). An\u000d\u000a      example is the Gateshead Boulevard project, where the Principal Engineer\u000d\u000a      (Transportation) of AECOM cites: \"three major benefits\" that the\u000d\u000a      VNG model brought to the project, namely (i) interoperability with: \"multiple\u000a        software packages (which) allowed us to visualise and fit our proposals\u000d\u000a        in three dimensions\"; (ii) its use with tools simulating: \"the\u000d\u000a        movement of vehicles ...( and)... the impact of vehicle queuing on the\u000d\u000a        street scene\"; and (iii) as\" \"an essential part of our\u000d\u000a        consultation exercises with Gateshead Council members&#8212;such that funding\u000d\u000a        could be secured for further design\" (Source 5). The\u000d\u000a      developers of the &#163;150 million Trinity Square project recognised that the\u000d\u000a      VNH model: \"provided the architects with the benefits of an\u000d\u000a        established and recognised tool\"...and...\"allowed us to address\u000d\u000a        the Local Authority's requirements of the impact of the development ...\u000d\u000a        and how the development would appear ties into the existing urban fabric\u000d\u000a        as part of a regenerated town centre\" (Source 6).\u000d\u000a    Generating cost efficiencies: Using the VNG model as an\u000d\u000a      experimental and developmental tool, Giddings et al. have produced\u000d\u000a      a methodology for the dynamic three-dimensional design of public spaces\u000d\u000a      and city centre squares (Reference 4) that was adopted by five\u000d\u000a      practices (including Jane Darbyshire and David Kendall; and Napper\u000d\u000a      Architects) in a RIBA North competition to design a new major square for\u000d\u000a      Newcastle upon Tyne. Professors Agnew and Dalton have adopted VNG for\u000d\u000a      their research fields of (respectively) Subway and City Climatology\u000d\u000a      and Agent-based Modelling. Subway climatology research (Reference\u000a        5) has informed our work with Nexus (operators of the Tyne and Wear\u000d\u000a      Metro system) which combines airflow measurement with laser scanning to\u000d\u000a      visualise air flows and produce a predictive and diagnostic design tool\u000d\u000a      for underground transport systems. To quote the Plant Engineering\u000d\u000a      Technical Manager of Nexus, the work: \" is very important in assisting\u000d\u000a        Nexus to make some critical business decisions... it is planned to spend\u000d\u000a        approximately &#163;1.6 million on replacing 6-off ventilation fans...(and)...preliminary\u000a        work (by Agnew) has shown that ...(they)...are likely not\u000d\u000a        needed.

Exhibitions based on the work of the Group, and the VNG model\u000d\u000a      have taken place at Gateshead Hilton CBI event (2010) and the model has\u000d\u000a      supported an exhibition by landscape artist Colin Booth at the Laing Art\u000d\u000a      Gallery, Newcastle (July to October, 2011). The model has been showcased\u000d\u000a      at a RIBA Public Programmes &#8212; A Place to Call Home Exhibition, RIBA\u000d\u000a      Portland Place, 2012, as well as forming the framework for the multimedia\u000d\u000a      animation in Peter Dillon's play `GUTS', performed as part of the Festival\u000d\u000a      of the North East, 2013. The work undertaken on the VNG project has been\u000d\u000a      presented at, and formed the foundation for debate at the Fish Quay\u000d\u000a      Neighbourhood Plan -Evidence and Issues Workshops (2011-13) on issues of\u000d\u000a      Localism in Planning.\u000d\u000a    The model is also an important basis for a virtual reconstruction of\u000d\u000a      Medieval Newcastle, supported by Newcastle City's Historic Environment\u000d\u000a      Group, which also uses the model's spatial information in a heritage\u000d\u000a      context and its data in archaeological explorations. According to the Tyne\u000d\u000a      and Wear County Archaeologist, this work: \"is helping with the\u000d\u000a        wider understanding and management of the City's surviving timber-framed\u000d\u000a        buildings and is demonstrating a methodology which will be used to\u000d\u000a        create a VR model of Hadrian's Wall which will be disseminated via an\u000d\u000a        augmented reality app...that will have a widespread public and\u000d\u000a        educational impact, and involve community groups, who will assist in the\u000d\u000a        research of the historical data\".

This led to the Virtual NewcastleGateshead (VNG) initiative\u000d\u000a      and creation of a VNG City Model, in 2009. The following examples of\u000d\u000a      research relate firstly to the applications of visualisation\u000d\u000a        throughout the built environment, then to the benefits of the\u000d\u000a        VNG model itself, and how they were realised, and finally, to the\u000d\u000a      use of VNG (and virtual city models in general) as a basis for simulation\u000a        and experimentation to inform design and decision-making.\u000d\u000a\u0009\u0009The aim of\u000d\u000a      the first piece of work (Reference 1) was to investigate the\u000d\u000a      current use of VR in the building industries of four countries (China,\u000d\u000a      Sweden, UK and USA). Semi-structured interviews with senior professionals\u000d\u000a      from each of six leading construction companies within each country\u000d\u000a      revealed the extent of usage and perceived benefits of VR. The findings\u000d\u000a      included the rationale for VR adoption and the barriers to doing so.\u000d\u000a    The next article (Reference 2) presents a detailed\u000d\u000a      study of the creation of VNG, set in the context of earlier efforts at 3D\u000d\u000a      city modelling. Based on investigations undertaken prior to setting up\u000d\u000a      VNG, it defines the ideal requirements of a virtual city model for city\u000d\u000a      authorities (urban planning and design), citizens (public participation)\u000d\u000a      and practitioners (architects, developers). It critically examines\u000d\u000a      available technologies, remote access issues, collaboration, and version\u000d\u000a      control. By 2012, VNG was sufficiently well-established to influence the\u000d\u000a      planning processes of the two authorities (Sources 1 and 2).\u000d\u000a    The next piece (Reference 3) examined the challenges of sustaining\u000d\u000a      virtual city models and how their success depends on strategic\u000d\u000a      collaborations between multiple organisations to ensure the model is\u000d\u000a      regularly used, continually updated, authoritative, and sustainable in the\u000d\u000a      longer term. The work also discusses `layering' models with data for\u000d\u000a      visualised simulations of the performance of urban spaces (movement,\u000d\u000a      noise, wind, and thermal comfort) and the consequent issues of data and\u000d\u000a      software interoperability.\u000d\u000a    This is taken up in a paper (Reference 4) focused on the optimum\u000d\u000a      design of `public squares' which considers the use of simulation software\u000d\u000a      (for solar and wind effects, thermal comfort, noise and pedestrian and\u000d\u000a      traffic movement movement). Noting the difficulties of interoperability\u000d\u000a      between available simulation software, the use is proposed of the virtual\u000d\u000a      city model `layered' with information in 3-D form from databases of\u000d\u000a      climatic and dynamic information.\u000d\u000a    Virtual models can also make an important contribution to our\u000d\u000a      understanding of the spatial performance from the standpoint of users (Reference\u000a        5). The paper presents a framework that integrates three important\u000d\u000a      factors &#8212; the spatial structure itself, the cognitive maps that users\u000d\u000a      construct, and their spatial strategies and abilities &#8212; that are of major\u000d\u000a      importance to building designers. The use of virtual environments for\u000d\u000a      experimental work in this area is examined.\u000d\u000a    The final paper (Reference 6) presents research carried out under\u000d\u000a      the &#8212;6.6 million NSR e-Mobility project.

Insights and new knowledge emerge as the work\u000a      progresses.\u000a    Kachhpura Settlement Upgrading Project (KSUP), Agra (2006 to date)\u000a    Collaborating with the Centre for Urban Regional Excellence (CURE) within\u000a      the Indian Government (GOI) funded Cross Cutting Agra (CAP) project,\u000a      students responded to the overwhelming need of the female inhabitants of\u000a      an urban village for sanitation. In 2007, 4 students installed the first\u000a      internal household toilet and washing space. They established the quality\u000a      and method of construction, carried out hygiene awareness workshops in the\u000a      schools and established a sustainable maintenance programme. Subsequently\u000a      by revolving the funds a further 200 internal toilets have been produced.\u000a    In addition, a DEWATS system to clean waste water was installed. Cleaned\u000a      water is used for irrigation, building work and toilet flushing.\u000a      Cooperation with Indian professionals, the Municipal Authority and the\u000a      Archaeological Survey of India followed. DEWATS was recognised as best\u000a      practice by the GOI (2013) and the Delhi Centre for Science and\u000a      Environment (CSE). The India Urban Challenge Fund is providing funds for\u000a      replication in other cities. In Agra, the Municipal Authority is\u000a      replicating DEWATS on a much bigger scale and is using it as a training\u000a      case study. The KSUP experience has contributed to the Citywide Slum\u000a      Upgrading Plan and Strategy aligned to the GOI's Housing for the Urban\u000a      Poor Programme. The project is featured in the Global Monitoring Report\u000a      2013 produced by The World Bank (Box 2.6, page 112, Catalysing Citywide\u000a      Slum Development in Agra), thus, in turn, the research is having an\u000a      outstanding impact in terms of reach and significance on the urban\u000a      development policy of India and at the world scale. This project has also\u000a      had a considerable impact on the analysis of buildings and settlements in\u000a      informal settlements by Space Syntax Ltd., who have collaborated to test,\u000a      on the ground, their mapping of Agra to develop and sensitise their\u000a      software programme to cultural as well as physical variables.\u000a    Savda Ghewra, Delhi: shared technologies for resettlement upgrading\u000a        (2008 to date)\u000a    In collaboration with CURE, ARCSR contributed to the process of house\u000a      design for a group of poor resettled families. Julia King's live\u000a      sanitation project proposal in Savda Ghewra won a Holcim Award (2012)\u000a      starting on site in April 2013. The Delhi Government is considering\u000a      replication of the model in peri-urban communities. Julia King was\u000a      nominated by ICON magazine as one of 50 young people, shaping the future\u000a      (August 2013), thus having an outstanding impact in terms of reach and\u000a      significance on the urban development policy of Delhi and on the debate on\u000a      the role of the architect.\u000a    Navi Mumbai Project for Community Classrooms (2008 to date)\u000a    Collaborating with Indian NGO ARPHEN, students and local quarry workers\u000a      constructed 2 classrooms providing primary education. As a result of the\u000a      classroom construction ARPHEN secured funding for teachers' salaries from\u000a      Hindustan Cola, children have a route into state education, adult literacy\u000a      and women's sewing classes have begun and the Municipal Corporation have\u000a      provided water taps, electricity and street lighting, new pathways and\u000a      formalised drainage. Project shortlisted for the Architect's Journal Small\u000a      Projects Award (February 2010).\u000a    Kaningo School Project, Freetown, Sierra Leone (2008 to date)\u000a    Collaborating with local NGO CESO students, researchers and an emergent,\u000a      post civil war community designed and constructed a primary school. This\u000a      process revealed the deep social and physical problems encountered by poor\u000a      Freetown residents. To address a sense of isolation from the city as a\u000a      whole, investigations into the architecture of 3 different but spatially\u000a      adjacent city neighbourhoods, followed by exhibitions at the British\u000a      Council in Freetown (July 2013) and London (part of the London Festival of\u000a      Architecture and International Architecture and Design Showcase 2012) have\u000a      laid down the basis for a sense of shared spatial identity.\u000a    Mitchell presented his paper `The Architect as Detective, Narrator and\u000a      Craftsperson' at an international symposium on `Design Tactics and the\u000a      Informalized City' at Cornell University in April 2012 indicating\u000a      outstanding impact in terms of the reach and significance on the debate on\u000a      the role of the architect working in informal cities.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research has improved the living conditions of urban residents,\u000a      adding value whilst `doing no harm'.

The originality lies in developing for these sensitive contexts\u000a      appropriate and effective methodologies whereby collaborative practice and\u000a      reflection creates shared understandings, of which research outputs are a\u000a      part. Investigations and live project interventions within informal\u000a      settlements undergoing rapid physical and cultural change have been\u000a      imagined, represented, advocated, operationalised, tested and sustained in\u000a      practice in small live projects through collaborations between ARCSR,\u000a      local NGOs and local inhabitants. Projects are appropriate not only\u000a      because they change lives and add value, but also because they do so\u000a      within an ethical framework extending beyond conventional research\u000a      practice to include the associated environmental, social and cultural\u000a      costs. They are made effective through a sustained programme of contextual\u000a      negotiation, institution formation and the assembly of practical\u000a      capabilities that are built into the research alongside the challenge of\u000a      making any positive impact at all in such difficult environments.

This idea has been developed further by\u000a      introducing a differentiation between the infrastructural and the\u000a      inhabitational spaces in architecture. This design approach is applicable\u000a      to large and small architectural scales.\u000a    The enhancement of the public realm at all scales in the city is the\u000a        starting point for ARU. Prof. Florian Beigel (Director of ARU) and\u000a      Prof. Philip Christou (Co-Director of ARU) have worked together since 1985\u000a      as key researchers with a team of Design Research Assistants at London\u000a      Metropolitan University.\u000a    Thinking about Architecture as City began as early as 1985 with the\u000a      design of the Half Moon Theatre in London http:\/\/aru.londonmet.ac.uk\/works\/halfmoon\/\u000a      &#8212; `a theatrical street with a roof over it'. This lead to ARU's\u000a      prize-winning international design competition entries for larger urban\u000a      landscape design projects in Japan, Nara Mats (1992), and the Sky\u000a        Mat, Yokohama Port Terminal (1994). Research into landscape\u000a      infrastructure was taken further with international design competition\u000a      projects that were built in Germany. Large open-cast coal mining\u000a      landscapes are being transformed into a city landscapes of lakes and new\u000a      settlements, Brikettfabrik Witznitz (1st prize, 1996), Kunstlandscaft\u000a        Cospuden (1st prize, 1997-2001). Following this, a large area\u000a      formerly used as military training grounds was to be transformed over\u000a      decades into a new city district on the southern edge of Berlin, Stadtlandshcaft\u000a        Lichterfelde S&#252;d, Berlin (1st prize, 1998).\u000a      \u000a        http:\/\/aru.londonmet.ac.uk\/works\/lichterfelde\/ In these projects the\u000a      dimension of time and the idea of designing for uncertainty became drivers\u000a      in the design research process. Experiments with the concept of\u000a      architectural infrastructures in the city were played out here, where the\u000a      inhabitation could be designed by others. We began to question the notion\u000a      of the master plan.\u000a    \"...implying a redefinition of planning, designed not to anticipate\u000a        the final picture, but to make possible or rather to stimulate\u000a        development processes, creating guidelines that allow us to interpret\u000a        land as a medium for laws of change and transformation that is not the\u000a        project's concern to predict or specify.\"\u000a    I&#241;aki Abalos, 2001\u000a    These large German urban projects led directly to ARU being invited to\u000a      develop the Urban and Landscape Concept Design for Paju Book City,\u000a        Korea, (1999-). Paju Phase 01 (completed in 2007) with over 300\u000a      buildings built by individual clients and their architects. Paju enjoys a\u000a      unique sense of civility which can be experienced in a special public\u000a      realm: an urban wetland that unifies the entire site; and a number of\u000a      cultural building clusters that offer views of the Han River landscape and\u000a      the nearby Simhak Mountain. ARU will be involved in the design of an urban\u000a      block in Paju Phase 02 during 2014.\u000a    ARU has completed three publishing houses at Paju Book City: Youl Hwa\u000a        Dang Publishing House 01 (2003), Positive Thinking People Publishing\u000a        House (2007) and the Youl Hwa Dang Book Hall Building (2009).\u000a      \u000a        http:\/\/aru.londonmet.ac.uk\/works\/youlhwadang02\/ These buildings sit\u000a      next to each other on Bookmakers' Street, forming a city cluster in Paju\u000a      with a generosity of spirit and sense of civility. Each building is an\u000a      essay about architecture as an urban figure, beginning with the abstract\u000a      almost pictogram quality, to a pair of dancing figures forming a little\u000a      public space, to an enquiry about the architectural language of continuity\u000a      and public decorum.\u000a    Based on the strength and public influence of the Paju project, ARU was\u000a      invited as one of 7 international design research teams to make an urban\u000a      design proposal within a 400 square km site on the South-West coast of\u000a      Korea. The ARU Saemangeum Island City (2008) http:\/\/aru.londonmet.ac.uk\/works\/saemangeum\/\u000a        anticipates a city of approx. 600,000 people to be built on land\u000a      reclaimed from the sea. This project is a compilation of the design\u000a      research concepts and strategies that ARU has developed over the past 2\u000a      decades.\u000a    The highly figurative and enigmatic Urban Folly Gwangju, Korea (2011)\u000a        http:\/\/aru.londonmet.ac.uk\/works\/folly\/ is playing out these themes\u000a      at the scale of a small building within the public realm of a busy Korean\u000a      city street. It is much loved and appreciated by the local citizens acting\u000a      as a shrine to commemorate the Gwangju Democracy Movement and public\u000a      massacre in 1980, and marks the position of the former city wall and\u000a      eastern city gate.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35586","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    ConCA work has significantly improved the understanding of what really\u000a      causes construction\u000a      accidents, as a major step towards preventing their occurrence.\u000a    In 2001, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) established a ten-year\u000a      work programme to make a\u000a      significant improvement to health and safety in construction owing to the\u000a      sector's poor health and\u000a      safety performance. HSE acknowledge that, from its publication in 2003,\u000a      the ConCA report RR156\u000a      was \"particularly relevant to the establishment and development\" of\u000a      this HSE programme, \"leading\u000a        to a number of initiatives being taken forward to target specific\u000a        activities and risks\". The ConCA\u000a      model's high-level similarity to an influence-network model that emerged\u000a      from other HSE-sponsored\u000a      research in particular gave HSE's Construction Division confidence to take\u000a      account of\u000a      all levels in the model hierarchies. Its synoptic sensibility has prompted\u000a      several initiatives targeting\u000a      specific risks; it persists today [C1, C2].\u000a    In 2009, the Loughborough University team's record led the HSE to\u000a      commission it to review\u000a      construction-safety research in order to inform the Donaghy `Fatals'\u000a      Inquiry, which the HSE was\u000a      supporting. As HSE note [C2], \"On these occasions it is\u000a        important that those leading the enquiries\u000a        are furnished with appropriately robust data and analysis. Loughborough\u000a        University's work in\u000a        support of phase one of the enquiry provided a consolidated view of\u000a        previous work on causal\u000a        factors as a platform for later stages\". Loughborough University\u000a      researchers influenced the inquiry\u000a      directly through one of two foundational reports published as part of the\u000a      inquiry. But more important\u000a      was an indirect influence through the lasting impact within HSE's\u000a      Construction Division of\u000a      Loughborough University's ConCA research. HFACS-C, the method of examining\u000a      the underlying\u000a      causes of fatal construction accidents adopted by Donaghy draws on ConCA,\u000a      notably for the\u000a      breadth of causal factors it recognizes [C3].\u000a    The current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has said that \"The\u000a        Government are\u000a        committed to addressing the heavy toll of deaths in the construction\u000a        industry which was highlighted\u000a        in Baroness Donaghy's report. We will therefore progress those of the\u000a        Donaghy recommendations\u000a        accepted by the previous Administration\", including, for example,\u000a      simplification of pre-qualification\u000a      for small firms tendering for publicly-funded construction work [C4].\u000a    HFACS-C is a version of HFACS, an aviation accident-investigation\u000a      framework first applied to\u000a      construction accidents by the HSE in 2007. HSE's development and use of it\u000a      continues today.\u000a      HSE's Health and Safety Laboratory used it in a 2012 study, for example,\u000a      of good safety practice in\u000a      the putting up and taking down of temporary demountable structures (TDSs).\u000a      HSE commissioned\u000a      the research and published the resulting report [C5] in\u000a      anticipation of the high demand for TDSs\u000a      they knew would occur for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\u000a      The London 2012\u000a      Games have since been celebrated for their exceptionally good health and\u000a      safety record (zero\u000a      fatalities and an accident rate six times better than the industry\u000a      average).\u000a    In 2009, concerned about a perceived neglect by industry of the risk of\u000a      catastrophic construction\u000a      incidents, the HSE commissioned Gibb and Loughborough University\u000a      colleagues to extend their\u000a      causality work to examine this risk with the Construction Industry\u000a      Research and Information\u000a      Association (CIRIA) `with a view to challenging industry to address issues\u000a      which appeared to offer\u000a      the best chance for improvement in performance'. In parallel with\u000a      publication of the findings by\u000a      HSE in Research Report 834, April 2011 [R6], CIRIA published Guidance\u000a        on catastrophic events\u000a        in construction (CIRIA, http:\/\/bit.ly\/1fld2SZ),\u000a      which supplemented material from RR834 [R6] with\u000a      material calculated to help practitioners respond practically to RR834.\u000a      Publication followed a series\u000a      of feature articles published in New Civil Engineer about the\u000a      catastrophe research, which helped\u000a      attract industry attention to this issue. Recommendations from\u000a      Loughborough University's\u000a      catastrophe work \"are now being taken forward by a working group\u000a        established by the Construction\u000a        Industry Advisory Committee (CONIAC) &#8212; a tri-partite committee of HSE,\u000a        industry and trades\u000a        unions\" [C2]. CONIAC advises HSE on protecting people from\u000a      construction-related health and\u000a      safety hazards.\u000a    The reach of ConCA has extended beyond both the construction industry and\u000a      the UK. For\u000a      example, after a fatality during construction of a new building in an\u000a      upgrade to its manufacturing\u000a      plant, Toyota Australia searched for a model that would best guide them\u000a      through a construction-\u000a      accident investigation, they consulted Royal Melbourne Institute of\u000a      Technology (RMIT) University\u000a      in Melbourne and were \"advised that the ConCA accident causation\u000a        model... would be able to\u000a        assist [them] in [their] investigation\". They \"found\u000a        the model useful in exploring both direct and\u000a        indirect causes of the accident, thus allowing better insight into how\u000a        the accident occurred\" [C6].\u000a    On the strength of their reputation, Gibb and Loughborough University\u000a      colleague Haslam (DHS),\u000a      with industry subcontractor Helen Bolt, were commissioned by the Olympic\u000a      Delivery Authority's\u000a      (ODA) to document the human and organisational contributions to the\u000a      exemplary construction\u000a      health and safety performance achieved by the ODA at London 2012. The\u000a      subsequent report\u000a      made publicly available on the ODA's Learning Legacy website, provides\u000a      examples to convey in\u000a      practical terms the key factors that contributed to the health and safety\u000a      achievement. Howard\u000a      Shiplee, the ODA's Construction Director commented, \"of all the 2012\u000a        Legacy Learning documents\u000a        I really believe this to be the most significant for the future.

The causes of\u000a      accidents are numerous and combine in complex patterns. Many accidents go\u000a      unreported and few\u000a      construction companies are sufficiently equipped to investigate and learn\u000a      from accidents. The\u000a      Health and Safety Executive (HSE) approach to construction accidents is\u000a      dictated as much by its\u000a      duty in law enforcement as to improving health and safety.\u000a    Until 2000, researchers of construction accident causes mainly focussed\u000a      on accident frequency\u000a      and patterns of incidence. When, rarely, they analysed accident data more\u000a      deeply, they\u000a      concentrated on the immediate accident circumstances, neglecting indirect\u000a      underlying influences\u000a      more remote from the accident location.\u000a    Loughborough University's ConCA was the first readily applied framework\u000a      to redress the balance\u000a      in our understanding of what causes construction accidents between the\u000a      indirect (distal) and direct\u000a      (proximal) causes and, at the same time, accord due weight to the\u000a      complexity of construction-accident\u000a      causation, with interlinked factors operating simultaneously at different\u000a      levels of the\u000a      hierarchy. Understanding what really causes accidents is the first major\u000a      step towards preventing\u000a      them in the future. Loughborough University's interdisciplinary project\u000a      (ConCA) began in 1999 to\u000a      gather rich data on 100 construction accidents with sensitivity to an\u000a      exceptionally broad range of\u000a      causal factors. The researchers won HSE funding from HSE's 1998-99\u000a      Competition for Ideas.\u000a    A trio of researchers led the project &#8212; Alistair Gibb, then a senior\u000a      lecturer (now Professor) in the\u000a      Department of Civil and Building Engineering (DCBE) (93 to date); Roger\u000a      Haslam, lecturer (now\u000a      Professor) in the Department of Human Sciences (DHS) (92 to date, now in\u000a      Design School); and\u000a      Diane Gyi, research development fellow (now Reader) in the Department of\u000a      Design and\u000a      Technology (93 to date). Research student Hide (DCBE 99-03) developed the\u000a      research methods,\u000a      collected data and made a detailed analysis of 40 of the 100 accidents,\u000a      obtaining her PhD in 2003.\u000a      Loughborough University research assistants Pavitt (DCBE 98-04) and\u000a      Atkinson (DHS 99-01)\u000a      collected and analysed data for the remaining 60 accidents.\u000a    Through their analysis, the team devised a hierarchical model of\u000a      construction-accident causality\u000a      distinguishing originating influences, shaping factors and immediate\u000a      accident circumstances. For\u000a      each of these, represented as layers in the model, they identified the\u000a      types of causal factor typical\u000a      of construction accidents [R1, R2, R3, R4].\u000a    With the ConCA model in place, the team were able to identify and\u000a      highlight specific causal chains\u000a      of concern away from the immediate circumstances and make corresponding\u000a      recommendations to\u000a      the industry such that, by applying these more accidents would be\u000a      prevented. The HSE published\u000a      the findings in report RR156 [R2]. The researchers have published\u000a      succinct accounts of their\u000a      model and its implications in academic literature [R3] and\u000a      publications read by practitioners [R1].\u000a    In 2009, Gibb led a team including DCBE research associates Pendlebury\u000a      2000-2009, Bust (2003\u000a      to date) and Brace (DHS, 2003 - 2006) in a review of international\u000a      research on the causes of fatal\u000a      construction accidents for an inquiry commissioned by the Secretary of\u000a      State for Work and\u000a      Pensions into the underlying causes of fatal construction accidents\u000a      (`Donaghy inquiry'). The team\u000a      based its approach on the ConCA model. The HSE published the team's\u000a      findings [R5]. In 2010,\u000a      Gibb used the ConCA model as the foundation for an HSE-funded\u000a      investigation of the risk of\u000a      catastrophic incidents in construction. The HSE published the findings in\u000a      its Research Report\u000a      series in 2011 [R6]. Two colleagues formed part of Gibb's team -\u000a      senior lecturer Lee Bosher\u000a      (DCBE 05 to date) and research assistant Kappia (DCBE, 2008-10).\u000a      Gilbertson of the Construction\u000a      Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) was an industrial\u000a      collaborator.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35615","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Three impacts are claimed here resulting directly from the research of\u000a      Cook and Lomas: (i)\u000a      improvements to indoor air quality, thermal comfort and energy performance\u000a      through better design\u000a      of ANV buildings in general, and the HAWAC building in particular, (ii)\u000a      greater confidence of the US\u000a      design team to design other low energy buildings, and (iii) a new product\u000a      for industrial collaborator\u000a      SEC leading to improved building energy performance for their customers.\u000a    i) Improvements to indoor air quality, thermal comfort and energy\u000a        performance\u000a    Cook and Lomas planned, coordinated and undertook commissioning,\u000a      fine-tuning and post-occupancy\u000a      monitoring of the HAWAC building. By identifying the causes of disparities\u000a      between\u000a      actual and intended performance, this work enabled contractors and\u000a      facilities managers to correct\u000a      errors and thus restore air quality and temperatures to levels nearer\u000a      those intended, whilst\u000a      maintaining the low energy credentials of the building and the\u000a      consequential low emission of\u000a      greenhouse gases [C1]. The expertise gained is applicable to\u000a      future projects of team members.\u000a    The low-energy credentials of the HAWAC building has raised the profile\u000a      of Judson University and\u000a      had a positive impact on its enhanced marketing strategy [C1]. The\u000a      impact for the University\u000a      culminated in the award of LEED Gold energy rating in Feb. 2009 in\u000a      recognition of the building's\u000a      design and performance [C3, C4].\u000a    (ii) Greater confidence of the US design team\u000a    For the US architects involved in the HAWAC building's commissioning, the\u000a      concept of ANV was\u000a      new. The experience has enabled them to go on to design other low-energy\u000a      buildings using natural\u000a      ventilation with greater confidence [C2]. The design strategy is\u000a      applicable to office-type buildings in\u000a      low-humidity climates across the globe. The work of Cook with SEC has had\u000a      wide reaching and\u000a      significant impact for the company's activity. The outcome of the\u000a      monitoring and simulation work\u000a      has been to replace the traditional, crude PC-based control system at\u000a      SEC's headquarters, with a\u000a      new controller in which CO2, temperature and humidity sensors\u000a      are integrated along with\u000a      processing hardware in a single housing. The NV LogIQTM\u000a      controller, which incorporates the new\u000a      algorithm developed in the underpinning research, is now the centrepiece\u000a      of a new product range\u000a      launched in 2012 [C5]. The controller also incorporates a logging\u000a      facility that enables data to be\u000a      collected at 10-second intervals at a centralised location so that\u000a      ventilation systems can be\u000a      properly commissioned and fine-tuned. As noted in the underpinning\u000a      research, a lack of post-occupancy\u000a      commissioning can be a major cause of unexpectedly poor performance in\u000a      naturally\u000a      ventilated buildings. The new NV LogIQTM controller makes such\u000a      commissioning possible as an\u000a      integral part of SEC's offering to clients. The new control system was\u000a      installed at SEC\u000a      headquarters in 2012 and has been refined by Khatami (LU researcher),\u000a      leading to an exemplary\u000a      showcase facility for SEC with direct impact on their marketing strategy [C6].\u000a      Monitoring and\u000a      occupant feedback has confirmed the performance advantages of the new\u000a      control algorithm in\u000a      terms of better indoor air quality, thermal comfort and energy performance\u000a      [C6]. The first\u000a      customers for the NV LogIQTM controller were secured early in\u000a      2013 and initial data has shown\u000a      effective operation. For example occupant thermal comfort was maintained\u000a      in the new naturally\u000a      ventilated offices of the Diocese of Nottingham (Dunham House), despite\u000a      the heat waves over the\u000a      summer of 2013. The underpinning research on hospital design, which was\u000a      incorporated into the\u000a      control algorithms developed, has ensured that the NV LogIQTM\u000a      controller is also fit for use in a\u000a      wide range of healthcare facilities. At the time of writing, SEC had\u000a      prepared quotations for\u000a      supplying NV LogIQTM for use in offices, schools and dwellings\u000a      [C6].\u000a    (iii) A new product\u000a    SEC sees its collaboration with Loughborough University as part of its\u000a      `aggressive new product\u000a      development programme ...' as `The results of this research have been\u000a      directly fed into new\u000a      products' [C7]. When the KTP project began late in 2008, new\u000a      product development commanded\u000a      the efforts of three SEC staff. By 2012 this had grown to seven full time\u000a      and two part time staff. The\u000a      company's capacity to absorb new knowledge and practices from research has\u000a      also improved\u000a      substantially. In the summer of 2012, the company had a Loughborough\u000a      University Masters\u000a      student carry out a short study aimed at further improving the positioning\u000a      of the ventilation\u000a      controllers at their headquarters.

However, realizing their energy demand reduction potential\u000a      while satisfying air quality\u000a      and thermal comfort requirements requires effective commissioning and fine\u000a      tuning of ventilation\u000a      control systems, both currently poorly understood. The research\u000a      underpinning the impacts reported\u000a      here addressed these issues and spans three projects.\u000a    Fine Tuning and Commissioning\u000a    This research was conducted between September 2008 and December 2012,\u000a      initially by Lomas\u000a      during his tenure as a Leverhulme Research Fellow focusing on ANV\u000a      buildings [G1]. The work\u000a      involved the synthesis and interpretation of measurement data from the\u000a      Harm A. Weber Academic\u000a      Center (HAWAC) at Judson University in Illinois [R1]. This is the\u000a      first US building to combine ANV\u000a      with a conventional HVAC system. Cook and Lomas were the energy and\u000a      environment design\u000a      consultants and responsible for the monitoring, fine tuning and\u000a      post-occupancy evaluation. The\u000a      analysis of their data [R2] confirmed that the ANV strategy was\u000a      functioning broadly as intended.\u000a      However, the work uncovered failings in building components leading to\u000a      excessive heating energy\u000a      consumption, and unexpected flow conditions due to local mechanical\u000a      ventilation systems. The\u000a      work is of generic value, applicable to all ANV buildings worldwide, as it\u000a      elucidates the barriers to\u000a      practical, cost-effective, implementation of low energy building solutions\u000a      and common design flaws\u000a      that jeopardise effective control and commissioning [R1, R2].\u000a    Hospital Design\u000a    This research, conducted between September 2009 and February 2013 by\u000a      Lomas, was funded by\u000a      the EPSRC [G2]. It showed that substantial energy demand reduction\u000a      is possible using ANV whilst\u000a      controlling hospital-originated infection and patient comfort even in a\u000a      warming climate [R3].\u000a      Alternative refurbishment options for buildings operated by four hospital\u000a      trusts, in Cambridge,\u000a      Bradford, Watford and Leicester, e.g. [R4], revealed the\u000a      incompatibility of the current Health\u000a      Technical Memorandum HTM03 and the imperative of reducing CO2\u000a      emissions [R5].\u000a    New product research\u000a    This research, funded by a Knowledge Transfer Partnership [G3]\u000a      between November 2008 and\u000a      May 2011, continues as a PhD project (Khatami, under Cook's supervision).\u000a      The realisation that\u000a      successful ANV buildings require robust, reliable components, tailored\u000a      fine tuning and\u000a      commissioning, as well as innovative design, was central to collaboration\u000a      with SE Controls (SEC).\u000a      Computer simulation demonstrated that energy consumption can be reduced by\u000a      at least 30% using\u000a      CO2-based control strategies to move dampers between multiple,\u000a      discrete opening positions in a\u000a      stepwise manner [R6]. A new controller was developed that\u000a      incorporated an optimized control\u000a      algorithm such that ventilation openings, commensurate with good air\u000a      quality, are used in winter,\u000a      thereby minimizing heating energy consumption. The research placed the\u000a      company's headquarters\u000a      at the centre of a monitoring study to field test and showcase the new\u000a      controller. Several control\u000a      strategies were trialled and simulated to arrive at detailed\u000a      recommendations. This was\u000a      subsequently implemented by SEC.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35801","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The development of the SuBETool has shaped the terms of sustainable\u000a      master-planning debates.

The\u000a      level of impact has increased as the research matured. Diverse,\u000a      complementary strategies were designed to enhance public, industry and\u000a      government awareness of the SuBETool (version 1). These included\u000a      dissemination through traditional web-based and professional publications,\u000a      academic symposia, engagement with key professional groups, industry and\u000a      government bodies, and industrial advisory panels (section 5:\u000a      1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).\u000a    Between the start of the research in 2008 and SuBETool's first pilot case\u000a      study in 2009 [Milan], AlWaer gave interim reports to organisations and\u000a      professionals and disseminated early conclusions in several international\u000a      conference\/summit talks on sustainable master-planning. As a direct\u000a      consequence of this exposure, a series of workshops were run by AlWaer at\u000a      Hilson Moran (2009). The Director of Sustainability at Hilson Moran\u000a      identified the potential of taking the work further in relation to the\u000a      firm's master-planning activities. Three principal collaborators (AlWaer,\u000a      Clements-Croome, Hilson Moran) subsequently developed the tool (Section 5:\u000a      1,8).\u000a    Hilson Moran adopted the SuBETool framework (version 1) as one of the\u000a      main protocols for large developments; namely: a major master-plan in\u000a      Milan (2009) and the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy in\u000a      Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (2010). Version 2 (SuBETool) was then applied to the\u000a      Greenwich Peninsular mixed use development, adjacent to the Millennium\u000a      Dome (2011). Hilson Moran is committed to applying SuBETool to its\u000a      master-planning activities to assess the sustainability of new\u000a      developments, and the SuBETool team [Husam Al Waer, Derek Clements-Croome,\u000a      Hilson Moran] are developing version 3: http:\/\/www.hilsonmoran.com\/sectors\/urban-regeneration\/\u000a      (Section 5: 1,8).\u000a    The SuBETool framework has led to changes in professional practice\u000a      relating to designing and planning for large and medium size master plans,\u000a      nationally and internationally. Based on the success of SuBETool, Scott\u000a      Brownrigg has developed their own method to assess the sustainability\u000a      performance of potential development land, called the Sustainability\u000a      Appraisal for Land Development (SALD). It enables the practice's\u000a      integrated master-planning, urban design and planning team to provide a\u000a      robust site analysis service for both local authorities and private\u000a      landowners. It is inspired by the BREEAM Communities, LEED Neighbourhood\u000a      Development and SuBETool methods: http:\/\/www.scottbrownrigg.com\/design_research_unit\/research_activities\/sald\/\u000a      (Section 5: 2,9,10).\u000a    The research has had broader impact within the construction industry\u000a      evidenced by AlWaer's invitation to sit on the steering committee of the\u000a      master-planning group at Hilson Moran since 2008. These close\u000a      academic-industry relations extend the profile of the Framework and its\u000a      innovative contribution to thinking about the master-planning process.\u000a    A number of inquiries from national and international organisations and\u000a      firms have been received for adapting the tool and applying it to new\u000a      contexts (Section 5: 9,10). The Building Research Environment (BRE)\u000a      offered to accredit the Framework as one of the world's leading assessment\u000a      tools for sustainable master-planning.

Since joining the\u000a      University of Dundee in 2008, Husam AlWaer has sought to embed appropriate\u000a      indicators of sustainability at the inception of a development project and\u000a      to integrate bespoke weightings for environmental stewardship, economic\u000a      growth and socio-cultural impact, according to regional differences and\u000a      development priorities. The work critically examined the available\u000a      methodologies of sustainable urban assessment and explored how integrated\u000a      systems-based approaches can be used to advance master-planning knowledge\u000a      and practice. The research involved Clements-Croome (University of Reading\u000a      and advisor to the project) and Hilson Moran, an international\u000a      multi-disciplinary engineering consultancy. A pilot phase was funded by\u000a      the University of Dundee's School of the Environment and Hilson Moran.\u000a    The research rationale was that the complexity of design, planning and\u000a      development activities for new urban solutions necessitates a form of\u000a      strategic forward planning that is itself resilient to change. Moreover,\u000a      the strategic management of diverse private and public interests,\u000a      coordination of operational processes, and professional team-working are\u000a      of paramount importance in major development schemes. The initial research\u000a      objective was to critically examine linear-sequential models of\u000a      master-planning, which are predicated on a desired end-state and tend to\u000a      comprise discrete physical parts, and to design a simple and responsive\u000a      approach to sustainable master-planning sensitive to the dynamic nature of\u000a      physical development and to the different stakeholder interests. Informed\u000a      by iterative feedback loop thinking, the logic of the tool's design\u000a      involves on-going assessment of the changing context; review of the\u000a      performance of design proposals; and adaptation of the built response.\u000a    A detailed and comparative view of the structure and operation of\u000a      assessment methods\/systems of master-planning worldwide identified a\u000a      number of concerns:\u000a    a. Short-termism: The available assessment systems focus on the\u000a      installation phase, rather than taking a longer-term life-cycle\u000a      perspective to ensure continued performance;\u000a    b. Narrow focus: Few methodologies give equal weighting to\u000a      environmental, socio-economic and cultural aspects of master-planning;\u000a    c. Limited stakeholder engagement: The multi-factorial nature of\u000a      master-planning requires a working consensus about critical issues and\u000a      their relative importance;\u000a    d. Black Box Syndrome: Assessment processes tend to lack clarity\u000a      for individual users with methods typically offering answers, but lacking\u000a      transparency and justification;\u000a    e. Poor transferability: Available frameworks lack adaptability\u000a      meaning that different regions cannot set priorities and rating systems\u000a      relevant to specific socio-economic, cultural and environmental contexts.\u000a    Based on the literature review and critical examination of assessment\u000a      systems then in use by developers, the research:\u000a    \u000a      re-conceptualised master-planning as a critical tool for framing\u000a        strategic, integrative action and framed it as a key stage in\u000a        development planning processes;\u000a      established a holistic framework comprising 75 social, economic and\u000a        environmental Key Performance Indicators, a weighting process, and an\u000a        assessment system, covering the total scope of urban sustainability;\u000a      piloted [Milan] the SuBETool Framework methodology for resolving\u000a        multi-partner action and stakeholder communication (version 1, 2009);\u000a      developed case studies [Greenwich] demonstrating how effective\u000a        communication of multiple variables and predicted impacts can be\u000a        realised across diverse sets of stakeholders (version 2, 2011).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35802","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of this research has been fourfold.

As a direct consequence of\u000a      this exposure numerous co-professional enquiries have resulted,\u000a      particularly in relation to the roof form and detail, from practices in\u000a      the UK, Ireland and The USA. Evidence of Hutton's design research\u000a      sub-themes can be seen in later architectural works such as those at\u000a      Scotland's recent `Highland Housing Expo' or a new work by New York based\u000a      Briggs Knowles Architecture + Design.

From this exposure a complex\u000a      observation relating to type emerges: critique is positive and favourable\u000a      if the viewer assumes `The Shed' is in fact just that &#8212; a utilitarian\u000a      agricultural building; critique from the same readers is less favourable\u000a      upon discovery that `The Shed' is in fact a residence. Further research in\u000a      how modern architecture is perceived and understood is warranted by these\u000a      observations. What this press and web exposure also elicits is popular\u000a      discussion regarding appropriate models of new rural dwelling that might\u000a      challenge the suburbanization of the countryside. The research suggests a\u000a      new language and patterns of dwelling as demanded by the Scottish\u000a      Government's Architecture Policy disseminated through Architecture and\u000a      Design Scotland.

Three further\u000a      commissioned dwellings have resulted from Planning Authority\u000a      recommendations to prospective rural developers to examine Drummond House\u000a      &#8212; `The Shed' as an appropriate modern rural archetype.\u000a    C.

In 2007 LJRH Chartered Architects commissioned Hutton to\u000a      undertake a series of domestic and institutional design projects whose aim\u000a      was to develop an architectural vocabulary appropriate to sensitive rural\u000a      locations that conformed to the Scottish Government's exceptional Planning\u000a      Advice Note 72:\u000a    \"The purpose is to create more opportunities for good quality rural\u000a        housing which respects the Scottish landscapes and building tradition.\u000a        The advice should not however be seen as a constraint on architects and\u000a        designers wishing to pursue innovative and carefully considered\u000a        contemporary designs.\"\u000a    The key research questions addressed were:\u000a    (1) How to develop a new and appropriate architectural expression\u000a      for a domestic building in an agricultural context.\u000a    (2) How to articulate a new narrative framework of principles for\u000a      serial design practice in landscape settings.\u000a    (3) How to extend local agricultural building technologies and\u000a      techniques to make a new and appropriate architecture.\u000a    The design research is a form of `model practice' whereby buildings,\u000a      designs and texts, define a conceptual framework to critically interrogate\u000a      and articulate a new architectural design vocabulary for sensitive rural\u000a      environments. It was commissioned against a background of increasing\u000a      pressure to develop redundant agricultural holdings in Scotland where few\u000a      exemplars existed demonstrating a contemporary design vocabulary\u000a      appropriate to such sensitive locations.\u000a\u0009Drummond House &#8212;`The Shed' was\u000a      completed in 2009, and published nationally, internationally, and online\u000a      2009-11 (see especially items in section 5b). It was the culmination of\u000a      several speculative designs developed as a series to interrogate recurring\u000a      themes in a variety of landscapes. These identified 5 design principles\u000a      which allow the introduction of modern and regenerating designs to\u000a      otherwise disused and often decaying agrarian settings (ref.

Without such a design vocabulary these\u000a      sites are often the subject of unsightly 'suburbanisation' or remain\u000a      undeveloped as the local authority refuses planning permission, deeming\u000a      applications 'inappropriate'. The research explored other vanguard 'new\u000a      ruralism' practitioners in the UK, Europe and the US but took more cues\u000a      from existing agricultural building typologies in Scotland rather\u000a      than the architectural vernacular per se. Hutton's research\u000a      highlights key ideas which question received wisdom as to what a 'house'\u000a      should 'look like' in such sensitive and characterful locations, in turn\u000a      significantly enhancing our appreciation of them and their surrounding\u000a      landscape. Drummond House 'The Shed' has contributed to a public debate of\u000a      what constitutes 'appropriate' building development and is a Scottish\u000a      Government 'exemplar' project in relation to architectural design and\u000a      place. It has also influenced design practice internationally.\u000a    Hutton conducted the research between 2007 to date while employed at the\u000a      University of Dundee. The research led to numerous invitations to deliver\u000a      academic and professional lectures, to exhibit and publish further work\u000a      and to new commissions for similar sites as recommended by different\u000a      Planning Authorities.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36411","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"},{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The DPU's research has contributed to building climate preparedness and\u000a      resilience in the urban\u000a      Global South by enhancing existing strategies adopted by affected\u000a      communities, and introducing\u000a      new methods for socio-technological structures to deal with cumulative and\u000a      sudden shocks. The\u000a      transfer of specialist knowledge holds impacts for policy-makers in\u000a      Bangladesh, Mozambique, and\u000a      India, within aid organisations (e.g. DFID and Oxfam), and for urban\u000a      planners and residents of\u000a      vulnerable cities. Impacts range from enhancing citizens' voices in local\u000a      governance structures and\u000a      supporting transparent decision-making to guiding aid policy and\u000a      governmental interventions, and\u000a      aiding urban planners through policy tools to plan for more resilient\u000a      cities. Perhaps most\u000a      significantly, DPU research contributed to culture shifts in development\u000a      and donor organisations\u000a      around the world, reinforcing changes in fundamental approaches to climate\u000a      change resilience.\u000a    At the local government level in the largest cities in countries like\u000a      Bangladesh and Mozambique,\u000a      research was used to build resilience through policy advice to\u000a      governmental programmes. Moving\u000a      from mitigation to adaptation is critical in Bangladesh, frequently\u000a      affected by the effects of climate\u000a      variability and climate change. Dhaka has experienced nine major floods in\u000a      the last 55 years,\u000a      disproportionally affecting the 3.4 million vulnerable urban poor with\u000a      limited\/no access to services.\u000a      The act of documenting community responses to climate variability [e]\u000a      facilitated the development\u000a      of strategies that moved from climate risk mitigation to planned\u000a      adaptation, via policy and financial\u000a      decisions seeking to address climate impacts before or soon after they\u000a      were manifest. Research\u000a      recommendations by DPU supported policy and planning for the development\u000a      of pro-poor land-use\u000a      planning and tenure security options within Dhaka's local government, and\u000a      on the design of\u000a      buildings and infrastructure to reduce climate change risks. This dialogue\u000a      was facilitated through\u000a      several focus group discussions and a multi-stakeholder workshop in August\u000a      2009, which had 46\u000a      participants, including community members, governmental actors and\u000a      representatives from\u000a      organisations working on urban poverty, climate change and urban planning\u000a      issues in Bangladesh.\u000a      Three lines of action were identified: access to basic urban services;\u000a      land-use planning and the\u000a      built environment; and disaster management strategies. The ongoing actions\u000a      by municipalities and\u000a      the coping strategies of the urban poor were mapped to identify synergies\u000a      and generate\u000a      recommendations for future action. The resulting strategies were\u000a      consolidated at the multi-stakeholder\u000a      workshop and endorsed in the plans and programmes of governmental agencies\u000a      [1].\u000a    Likewise, in Maputo, an innovative participatory research process\u000a      encouraged working\u000a      partnerships between diverse actors with the aim of bridging the gap\u000a      between policy rhetoric and\u000a      action. This city of 1 million inhabitants (half below the poverty line)\u000a      is subject to frequent flooding\u000a      and vulnerable to rising sea levels. Communities described the drainage\u000a      faults associated with\u000a      uncontrolled waste disposal as the main factor influencing vulnerabilities\u000a      to climate change in the\u000a      research area, Chamanculo C district. Seeking to address this challenge,\u000a      in partnership with the\u000a      National Fund for the Environment of Mozambique (FUNAB), Reading\u000a      University and York\u000a      University, DPU research supported networking in 2012-13 between\u000a      residents, private sector\u000a      actors, and government authorities, including the Ministry for\u000a      Coordination of Environmental Affairs\u000a      (MICOA), the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), and Maputo\u000a      Municipality.\u000a    The first step involved the development of a process of community\u000a      organisation that led to the\u000a      constitution of a local planning committee on climate change (CPC). These\u000a      CPC members\u000a      represent different interest groups rarely represented in such\u000a      negotiations, such as the elderly,\u000a      youth, housewives, traders and salaried workers. The CPC has five\u000a      community members elected\u000a      by local residents, who met weekly from April to July 2012. They held\u000a      meetings with experts and\u000a      institutions, working independently of the DPU\/FUNAB project team to\u000a      develop and implement a\u000a      Local Action Plan for Climate Compatible Development with the municipal\u000a      government [2]. While\u000a      this research engaged actors already concerned with climate change (MICOA;\u000a      INGC), through the\u000a      CPC it also brought climate change to urban governance bodies where it\u000a      previously did not exist.\u000a    Real changes in the lives of Maputo residents were already underway\u000a      towards the end of the\u000a      impact period. The CPC had begun negotiating the implementation of the\u000a      strategies emerging from\u000a      its dialogues within the informal settlement of Chamanculo C. These\u000a      included new provisions for\u000a      recycling and composting centres, and the establishment of waste\u000a      collection points to alleviate the\u000a      impacts of flooding on blocked drainage. To achieve their goals, the CPC\u000a      established links with\u000a      local associations, private operators and NGOs involved in waste\u000a      management. Out of the Local\u000a      Action Plan, drawn up in July 2013, the CPC has also begun to develop an\u000a      environmental\u000a      education programme with the Maputo University Eduardo Mondlane for better\u000a      training in climate\u000a      change issues, correct usage of water, and treatment of domestic waste,\u000a      and it used this\u000a      educational process to extend networks within and between communities, and\u000a      to mobilise\u000a      residents for the regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage channels [2;\u000a        p.9]. In a city whose\u000a      fast and unregulated growth had outstripped the provision of basic\u000a      services, particularly in the\u000a      context of a changing climate, this community-led programme demonstrated\u000a      to local policy-makers\u000a      that residents &#8212; even the relatively uneducated &#8212; can handle climate\u000a      information if there is an entry\u000a      point that relates such information to their own experience, such as\u000a      flooding [3]. Policy makers\u000a      subsequently have no vowed to extend this programme to other\u000a      neighbourhoods.\u000a    Working at the NGO level, DPU researchers are also closely involved in\u000a      the design and\u000a      operationalisation of new approaches to the study of climate change\u000a      resilience in Latin America. In\u000a      2012&#8212;13, the DPU advised Oxfam's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) office\u000a      on managing risk\u000a      and working with vulnerability in relation to disaster risk reduction. Dr\u000a      Camillo Boano (Senior\u000a      Lecturer) and Dr Alexandre Apsan Frediani (Lecturer) facilitated a\u000a      three-day workshop in 2012 with\u000a      government officials, civil society organisations, and Oxfam officers from\u000a      La Paz, Guatemala and\u000a      the regional office in Mexico City. This contributed to ongoing action\u000a      within Oxfam's LAC office in\u000a      re-shaping their urban strategies in relation to risk and vulnerability\u000a      reduction, shifting again from\u000a      mitigation strategies to addressing the actual root causes of risk\u000a      production.\u000a    For example, this collaboration has redefined the initial terms of\u000a      reference of a project undertaken\u000a      in La Paz and Guatemala City away from more traditional reactive\u000a      mitigation strategies towards the\u000a      exploration of local and innovative adaptation plans [4]. This was\u000a      demonstrated in the resulting\u000a      report, Exploring Oxfam's room for manoeuvre to address the production\u000a        of urban risk, which\u000a      sought to highlight the social drivers of risk in La Paz and Guatemala\u000a      City [5; especially pp. 6, 10,\u000a        22]. In particular, DPU research has underpinned recommendations for\u000a      further action, including\u000a      expanding the knowledge base on intra-community perceptions of risk\u000a      (disaggregating community\u000a      experiences by gender, disability, tenure status, etc.), as well as\u000a      redefining the understanding of\u000a      urban risk as a social and political product; and collapsing the divide\u000a      between urban planning and\u000a      the field of disaster risk reduction, which as noted has tended to be more\u000a      reactive [5; pp. 51, 53].\u000a    The Future-Proofing Cities project [b] also spurred\u000a      international donors to reassess their aid\u000a      priorities to support effective local responses that could support\u000a      resilient urban development. The\u000a      project recommendations were adopted by DFID in 2012 as a diagnostic tool\u000a      to guide its climate-change\u000a\u0009  portfolio and mechanisms for funding, resource, and project\u000a      allocation throughout Asia,\u000a      Latin America, and Africa [6]. The reach of this impact on\u000a      international debates is demonstrated by\u000a      the fact that the Future-Proofing Cities website has received over\u000a      300,000 hits since December\u000a      2012 and the report was downloaded over 2,000 times by users in multiple\u000a      countries and\u000a      organisations. This included municipal governments, leading developers and\u000a      architects (e.g.\u000a      Balfour), strategy consultants, technology providers (e.g. Siemens),\u000a      funding institutions, and water\u000a      and energy companies in the Global South. It also attracted the attention\u000a      and endorsement of\u000a      organisations such as the World Bank [7], Rockefeller Foundation,\u000a      and Cities Alliances [6].\u000a    Since March 2013, the same model has been applied in two Indian cities:\u000a      Bangalore and Madurai,\u000a      implemented through Future-Proofing Indian Cities with &#163;450,000\u000a      committed by the Climate and\u000a      Development Knowledge Network (partially funded by DFID) [8]. This\u000a      is using the Future-Proofing\u000a        Cities framework to undertake a participatory action planning\u000a      process to develop urban risk\u000a      diagnostics and action plans for Bangalore and Madurai. The diagnostic\u000a      stage was completed in\u000a      July 2013 and informed discussions with the state and municipal\u000a      governments, service utilities and\u000a      civic society organisations. Stakeholders in both cities prioritised a\u000a      focus on the rehabilitation of\u000a      infrastructure to develop future proofing strategies, which will inform\u000a      the subsequent stages of the\u000a      programme. In Madurai, this was endorsed at a city-wide consultation in\u000a      September 2013\u000a      organised by Development of Humane Action (DHAN) Foundation &#8212; now a\u000a      partner in the project &#8212; which\u000a      was attended by over 30 officials from the municipal corporation, plus\u000a      other representatives\u000a      from the City Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) and City Volunteer Technical\u000a      Corps (CVTC).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research work into the development and transference of methods for\u000a      climate readiness and\u000a      resilience by Allen et al has created impacts at every stage of the\u000a      planning process.

In the project on Adaptation\u000a        to Climate Change\u000a        in Cities (2008-10), Dr Cassidy Johnson (Lecturer during the period\u000a      of research) and Dr Adriana\u000a      Allen (Senior Lecturer) demonstrated how people living in informal\u000a      settlements in Dhaka,\u000a      Bangladesh adapt to climate variability and cope with changing\u000a      environments. The key innovation\u000a      in this work was the proposal that significant lessons can be drawn from\u000a      examining how the urban\u000a      poor are already managing conditions of increased vulnerability by drawing\u000a      on their social, political\u000a      and knowhow capital, and revealing how these strategies can be scaled up\u000a      and supported at the\u000a      policy level [e]. Similarly, in A\u000a        Public-Private-People-Partnership for Climate Compatible\u000a        Development in Maputo (2013), Dr Vanesa Cast&#225;n Broto (Lecturer)\u000a      emphasises the voices of\u000a      ordinary citizens, experimenting with different forms of dialogue in\u000a      planning to support meaningful\u000a      resident participation in the design of policy and planned responses at\u000a      the local, national and\u000a      international levels [d]. In particular, this project seeks to\u000a      engage stakeholders who are traditionally\u000a      excluded from the official planning process, including ordinary residents\u000a      and informal traders.\u000a    The second strand of DPU research looks specifically at the future of\u000a      cities by focusing on the\u000a      production and regulation of urban risks and vulnerabilities associated\u000a      with climate change,\u000a      carbonisation and `lock-in' energy systems, and the erosion of vital\u000a      ecosystems services. Future-Proofing\u000a        Cities, as funded by the Department for International Development\u000a      (DFID) and led by\u000a      Atkins UK, in partnership with the DPU (Allen, Cast&#225;n Broto; and Caren\u000a      Levy, Senior Lecturer)\u000a      examined the environmental risks faced across 129 cities in 20 developing\u000a      countries. They\u000a      developed five urban `typologies' or trajectories to support the design of\u000a      interventions suited to\u000a      specific environmental conditions and city types. These trajectories\u000a      comprise: energy intensive\u000a      cities with significant carbon footprints, cities affected by major\u000a      climate hazards, cities with risks to\u000a      regional support systems (water and food), cities facing multiple risks\u000a      and cities with a low current\u000a      risk profile. Over 100 policy options for future-proofing were scrutinised\u000a      against their relevance to\u000a      different urban trajectories of change, different levels of vulnerability,\u000a      as well as their capacity to\u000a      deliver integrated social, environmental and economic benefits and the\u000a      capacities required for their\u000a      successful implementation (governance, planning, finance and delivery\u000a      requirements). The\u000a      research reveals that the possibilities of cities to be resilient to\u000a      multiple environmental risks are not\u000a      just determined by their past trajectories, current vulnerabilities and\u000a      future risks &#8212; but can be\u000a      activated through sensitive diagnosis and wise interventions [b].\u000a      The DPU team provided strategic\u000a      guidance on the development of the analytical framework, and wrote up the\u000a      case studies on these\u000a      typologies in Bangkok, Maputo, Bangalore, Karachi and Nairobi. This\u000a      research provided a nuanced\u000a      framework to assess not only the multiple environmental risks faced by\u000a      cities in the developing\u000a      world but also the different degrees of vulnerability affecting their\u000a      citizens.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36412","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The general public and most journalists view skateboarding with\u000d\u000a      bemusement and bewilderment, being unable to understand how an activity\u000d\u000a      largely regarded as child's play should be practiced by millions. Borden's\u000d\u000a      research has played a key role in challenging this notion. He has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that these informal spaces are an important part of urban\u000d\u000a      space, and thus has helped create a paradigm shift reaching across the\u000d\u000a      world in how the general public, media professionals and design\u000d\u000a      professionals &#8212; as well as skateboarders themselves &#8212; understand these\u000d\u000a      spaces and the communities who inhabit them.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on the public understanding of skateboarding:\u000d\u000a    The reach of Borden's impact is demonstrated by the number and\u000d\u000a      wide range of media and public engagement outlets, reaching a diverse\u000d\u000a      international audience through feature articles, interviews (in print and\u000d\u000a      on television), exhibitions, public talks and documentaries. Its significance\u000d\u000a      is demonstrated by the broad shifts in public opinion regarding\u000d\u000a      skateboarding, whereby the public now no longer consider skateboarding to\u000d\u000a      be a craze enjoyed by children, or a disorderly activity practiced by\u000d\u000a      troublesome youth, but a positive form of exercise with widespread\u000d\u000a      benefits to modern society. Thanks to this shift in understanding, the\u000d\u000a      `Long Live Southbank' campaign to keep skateboarding at London's Southbank\u000d\u000a      Centre (see below) has gained over 50,000 members [1].\u000d\u000a    As the first and only major account of skateboarding, this monograph [d],\u000d\u000a      and Borden himself, are the major resource for journalists and organisers\u000d\u000a      of public events seeking to better understand skateboarding and its rise\u000d\u000a      in popularity from the 1970s onwards. Articles such as Borden's\u000d\u000a      `Skateboarders are essential for our cities' in The Independent,\u000d\u000a      originally written in 2001, remain widely read, with its great public\u000d\u000a      significance demonstrated by this having been that newspaper's seventh\u000d\u000a      most viewed article in March 2012 [2]. The research reach extends\u000d\u000a      beyond the UK &#8212; for example, Borden has been interviewed by the Salt\u000d\u000a        Lake City Weekly (4 September 2008) [3], and for a Spanish\u000d\u000a      television news documentary on skateboarding by Televisa (February 2008).\u000d\u000a    The comprehensive exploration in his book of the history and value of\u000d\u000a      skateboarding has also been of great interest to artistic producers\u000d\u000a      seeking to investigate skateboarding, and for whom Borden's research\u000d\u000a      provides intellectual frameworks, interpretive categories and specific\u000d\u000a      data. For example, an extended interview with Borden &#8212; along with book\u000d\u000a      extracts &#8212; provided the main rationale, structure and inter-titles for the\u000d\u000a      avant-garde film Hacking the Streets (directed by Sangam Sharma,\u000d\u000a      2009-10). This film explores the `appropriation of urban space and the\u000d\u000a        perception of architecture by the subculture of skateboarders' by\u000d\u000a      using Borden's research on Lefebvre's concepts of space, skateboard-city\u000d\u000a      interfaces, super-architectural space, micro-spaces, spatial-degree zero,\u000d\u000a      political meanings and cultural values. Borden's commentary forms over 50%\u000d\u000a      (17:32 minutes of a total 34:50 minutes) of that film, which was shown at\u000d\u000a      the Jihlava Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic (2010),\u000d\u000a      Festival OFNI in Poitiers (2011) and Festival Cin&#233;ma Brive (2011) [4].\u000d\u000a    Borden's 2001 book has also impacted on the preparations, rationale and\u000d\u000a      content of art exhibitions such as Rise of Rad: Influence of Skate\u000d\u000a        Culture on Contemporary Art, Torrance Museum, California (24 July &#8212;\u000d\u000a      4 September 2010), which quoted from it in both the exhibition and\u000d\u000a      catalogue. Borden has advised and been interviewed about skatepark design\u000d\u000a      for the Nutopia and National Geographic television documentary on The\u000d\u000a        80s: the Decade That Made Us (May 2013), and for the Channel 4\u000d\u000a      documentary, Concrete Circus (2011), directed by noted\u000d\u000a      documentary-maker Mike Christie, and which had 916,800 viewers on release\u000d\u000a      [5].\u000d\u000a    Skateboarding at the South Bank Centre:\u000d\u000a    In 2012-13, the contemporary relevance of Borden's research was\u000d\u000a      demonstrated when it was announced that London's Southbank Centre (SBC)\u000d\u000a      intended to turn its Undercroft beneath the Queen Elizabeth Hall into a\u000d\u000a      retail destination. The Undercroft space was first skateboarded in 1975\u000d\u000a      and has long been considered as the sport's original home in the UK. From\u000d\u000a      the beginning, SBC managers considered skateboarders an unwelcome\u000d\u000a      nuisance, and so considered moving them off the site. Borden's research\u000d\u000a      was used in the arguments against this plan. The campaign has now led to\u000d\u000a      wider public understanding of the place of skateparks, and particularly\u000d\u000a      the Undercroft, as part of London's lived heritage; it is ongoing and\u000d\u000a      intensifying at the end of the REF impact period.\u000d\u000a    As an example, Borden was interviewed about skateboarding's art, design,\u000d\u000a      cultural and social worth, subculture and politics in the Save the\u000d\u000a        Southbank documentary on skateboarding (directed by Winstan Whitter\u000d\u000a      and Toby Schuall, released 1 February 2008), where his comments form over\u000d\u000a      25% (5:53 minutes of 22:45 minutes) of the running time, using his\u000d\u000a      research to contribute to the argument to retain skateboarding at the\u000d\u000a      venue [6]. This video had over 3,900 plays on Vimeo and was, in\u000d\u000a      2013, an integral part of the concerted campaign to retain skateboarding\u000d\u000a      at the Southbank. It was used by popular skateboard websites to mobilise\u000d\u000a      skateboarders; Stereophonic Supply Co., for example, stated that `this\u000d\u000a        excellent and well reasoned documentary goes straight to the heart of\u000d\u000a        the debate' [7]. Borden also contributed through his\u000d\u000a      writings in the skateboard-specialist press, such as \"Hallowed Grounds:\u000d\u000a      Skateboarding at the Southbank Centre\" in the alternative sports magazine,\u000d\u000a      Huck (June\/July 2013) [8]. In 2013 alone, Borden was\u000d\u000a      interviewed and\/or consulted on this subject by Al Jazeera TV, ARD TV\u000d\u000a      (Germany), BBC London Radio, LBC Radio. Building Design, Daily\u000d\u000a        Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The\u000d\u000a        Times and Tampa Bay Times.\u000d\u000a    From April to July 2013, Borden was involved in negotiations to retain\u000d\u000a      part of the original Undercroft area, contributing both to the SBC\u000d\u000a      proposals for and to the `Long Live Southbank' activist group [9].\u000d\u000a      His longstanding research into the cultural value of skateboarding fed\u000d\u000a      into to public talks at the SBC, and into giving advice to its managers,\u000d\u000a      which in turn facilitated a reversal of SBC policy, with the allocation in\u000d\u000a      March 2013 of &#163;1 million funds and a permanent SBC site for skateboarding\u000d\u000a      and other urban arts such as BMX and graffiti [10]. This new,\u000d\u000a      prime site under the Hungerford Bridge will offer 1,200m2 of\u000d\u000a      space and 9 million footfall per annum (improving on the 1,100m2\u000d\u000a      and 7 million footfall at the Undercroft location). Using his research\u000d\u000a      into skateboarding subculture, practices and politics, Borden, with\u000d\u000a      Richard Holland, acted as lead SBC consultants for the new site and were\u000d\u000a      responsible in mid-2013 for writing its design brief (finalised 26 July\u000d\u000a      2013), inviting specialist skateboard facility designers, assessing their\u000d\u000a      proposals, and undertaking initial consultations. This design brief was a\u000d\u000a      major development of Borden's ideas, first implemented at Milton Keynes\u000d\u000a      (see below), of creating everyday designs for skateboardable urban spaces\u000d\u000a      &#8212; here with even greater consideration of using common urban materials\u000d\u000a      such as brick and stone (not smooth concrete), street steps and benches\u000d\u000a      (not spectacular forms), and encouraging the integrated use of the site by\u000d\u000a      skateboarders, BMX riders, graffiti-writers, parkour and general public.\u000d\u000a    Provision of tailored skateboarding facilities by architects and urban\u000d\u000a        managers:\u000d\u000a    An important question for architects and urban managers today is how to\u000d\u000a      provide and design facilities suitable for alternative sports (like\u000d\u000a      skateboarding) without diminishing their counter-cultural nature. Borden's\u000d\u000a      work on the history and development of skatepark design, together with his\u000d\u000a      exploration of skateboarding practices and subcultures, enabled him to\u000d\u000a      give valuable advice to municipal authorities, charities, architects and\u000d\u000a      urban designers, leading to the establishment of skateboarding facilities\u000d\u000a      and recognition of the need to preserve them in the UK and United States.\u000d\u000a    In June &#8212; September 2002, Borden drew on his research on skateboarding\u000d\u000a      design and subculture to advise Milton Keynes on how it could take\u000d\u000a      advantage of its status as `as one of the top five cities in the world\u000d\u000a        for street skating' by producing skateboard facilities which were\u000d\u000a      more like ordinary streets (`skateplazas') and less like distinct\u000d\u000a      purpose-designed terrains (`skateparks'). Borden gave a talk to Milton\u000d\u000a      Keynes council planners and participated in two workshops sessions with an\u000d\u000a      architect, Richard Ferrington, community workers and local skateboarders,\u000d\u000a      following which Ferrington and skateboarder Rob Selley designed the &#163;100k\u000d\u000a      Buszy facility (opened March 2005). Widely acknowledged as the UK's first\u000d\u000a      skateplaza, it has been described by some professional skateboarders as `the\u000d\u000a        best spot they have ever skated' [11]. Its success led to\u000d\u000a      the establishment of 100+ similar municipal facilities in the UK, ranging\u000d\u000a      from the 600m2 Fisher Lane Park in Mansfield (established 2009,\u000d\u000a      budget of &#163;96k), the 900m2 Kingshill in Cirencester (2013,\u000d\u000a      &#163;200k), the 3,200m2 Central Forest Park in Stoke (2005, &#163;561k),\u000d\u000a      and the 2,400m2 Prissick Plaza in Middlesborough (2006, &#163;600k).\u000d\u000a      All were based on principles laid out by Borden's research and as first\u000d\u000a      implemented in Milton Keynes. These skateplazas remain extremely popular\u000d\u000a      amongst both planners and skateboarders, as indicated by a comment in 2012\u000d\u000a      by Skates and Ladders, the respected UK guide on where to\u000d\u000a      skateboard, that the Buszy `is easily one of the best block spots in\u000d\u000a        the country' [12]. This experience hence shaped Borden's\u000d\u000a      more recent contribution to the SBC redesign.\u000d\u000a    Finally, Borden's pioneering research into the history of skateboarding\u000d\u000a      facility design and provision &#8212; which recognises skateparks as important\u000d\u000a      architectural products of design and cultural value &#8212; has also had an\u000d\u000a      impact on their historic preservation. For example, Borden in January &#8212;\u000d\u000a      February 2013 advised English Heritage on the listing of an original 1970s\u000d\u000a      skatepark, and as a result of this advice an application to list the\u000d\u000a      3,150m2 Rom skatepark in Essex was underway in June &#8212; July\u000d\u000a      2013. Borden also provided video evidence on 11 June 2013 to Tampa's\u000d\u000a      Historic Preservation Commission regarding the 1978 Perry Harvey Skatepark\u000d\u000a      in Tampa, Florida, USA, which, on 25 July 2013, was duly recommended by\u000d\u000a      the Florida National Register review board for official designation and\u000d\u000a      protection on the National Register of Historic Places [13].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Borden's research into the history and contemporary urban practice of\u000d\u000a      skateboarding, and particularly its role within cities and public spaces,\u000d\u000a      has enhanced understanding of this global urban activity, leading to\u000d\u000a      significant changes in how the public and media understand skateboarding\u000d\u000a      culture in the UK and abroad. His work has also contributed to the\u000d\u000a      campaign to save a historic skateboarding site at the Southbank Centre in\u000d\u000a      London, and to moves to protect similar sites elsewhere.

Professor Iain Borden\u000d\u000a      (researcher at UCL from 1989, Professor of Architecture &amp; Urban\u000d\u000a      Culture from 2002) uses theoretical and interdisciplinary perspectives to\u000d\u000a      study the everyday and experiential aspects of urban space, focussing on\u000d\u000a      previously overlooked quotidian spaces, practices, qualities and\u000d\u000a      representations &#8212; and particularly those related to the urban practice of\u000d\u000a      skateboarding.\u000d\u000a    Borden's research into the production and experience of space, and\u000d\u000a      particularly his work on skateboarding, has contributed new understandings\u000d\u000a      of urban space in three ways: (1) Highlighting experiential aspects of\u000d\u000a      cities, including the idea that cities and architecture are produced not\u000d\u000a      just by urban professionals like architects, planners and urban managers\u000d\u000a      but are constantly remade by the general public through everyday usage;\u000d\u000a      (2) Introducing new and overlooked spaces and objects of study, such as\u000d\u000a      the practice of skateboarding; and (3) Intersecting architectural history\u000d\u000a      with disciplines such as anthropology, critical theory, cultural studies,\u000d\u000a      geography and urban history.\u000d\u000a    Borden's major monograph in 2001 used philosopher Henri Lefebvre's ideas\u000d\u000a      to examine how skateboarders adopt cities as pleasure-grounds, thereby\u000d\u000a      showing how architecture is reproduced through the everyday practices of\u000d\u000a      different users [d]. This allows cities and architecture to be\u000d\u000a      seen not just as the products of architects and planners but as being\u000d\u000a      remade every time a skateboarder uses these spaces. The monograph included\u000d\u000a      detailed studies of: (i) The origins of skateboarding and its 50 year\u000d\u000a      development into a global phenomenon; (ii) How specialist skateboarding\u000d\u000a      terrains &#8212; skateparks, ramps, skateplazas etc. &#8212; have been designed and\u000d\u000a      constructed; (iii) Subcultural aspects of skateboarding including\u000d\u000a      graphics, language and ideologies; (iv) Skateboarding practices in city\u000d\u000a      streets and other urban spaces, including its value as a performative\u000d\u000a      critique of society, and its consequent benefits to skateboarders and\u000d\u000a      non-skateboarders; and (v) Art, video, photography and other\u000d\u000a      representations of skateboarding.\u000d\u000a    Earlier, from 1994, Borden also collaborated on Strangely Familiar,\u000d\u000a      an interdisciplinary research project which included a major academic book\u000d\u000a      in which his chapter explored how skateboarders undertake a cultural and\u000d\u000a      political critique of city spaces [b]. He worked with Jane Rendell\u000d\u000a      (now a Professor in the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture), Joe Kerr and\u000d\u000a      Alicia Pivaro on a multi-venue exhibition with associated catalogue [a],\u000d\u000a      with his exhibition contribution delineating the history of skateboarding\u000d\u000a      in cities and public spaces worldwide. This project also, in more general\u000d\u000a      terms, rethought the city through alternative historical narratives and\u000d\u000a      everyday life, thus helping to `understand the complex intersection of\u000d\u000a        architecture, cities and urban living' [a; p. 8].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36437","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A combination of UCL research between 2004 and 2006, later follow-up\u000d\u000a      work, and dissemination through nearly 30 conferences and seminars in the\u000d\u000a      UK and worldwide from 2004-13 has established the effectiveness of design\u000d\u000a      codes in the delivery of high-quality residential design in England and\u000d\u000a      overseas.

The document thus\u000d\u000a        endorses the practice guide and goes on to summarise key findings from\u000d\u000a        the research regarding the benefits of design coding for stakeholders [5;\u000a          p. 128]\u000a\u000d\u000a      The 2012 online guidance of ATLAS, the government funded independent\u000d\u000a        advisory service on large scale development, which advocates the use of\u000d\u000a        design coding in their work in order to fulfil one of their corporate\u000d\u000a        objectives, to improve the speed and quality of major housing\u000d\u000a        developments. In doing so they draw from the research to shape their own\u000d\u000a        advice to clients on the use of design codes, quoting Preparing\u000d\u000a          Design Codes: A Practice Manual [c] as `the key reference'\u000d\u000a        [6; item T2.9]. This emphasis is reflected in its discussion of\u000d\u000a        means to ensure design quality through case studies of successful\u000d\u000a        projects it has advised on, for example, a successful proposal in 2010\u000d\u000a        to develop west of Waterlooville in Hampshire with 3,000 homes. In this\u000d\u000a        case, ATLAS identified the early submission of design codes as a key\u000d\u000a        driver on quality and a catalyst in creating a conversation about design\u000d\u000a        [7].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Adoption of design codes:\u000d\u000a    By providing the evidence base to advocate for design codes, and the\u000d\u000a      guidance on adopting them, the research has been hugely influential in\u000d\u000a      driving practice. This was demonstrated through research led by Carmona\u000d\u000a      for the Urban Design Group (UDG) in 2012, which tested the diffusion of\u000d\u000a      design coding as a tool in the development process, and revealed the scale\u000d\u000a      of this influence. From an almost standing start in 2003, by 2012 around\u000d\u000a      45% of local authorities (geographically spread across England) had used\u000d\u000a      design codes and 66% of urban design consultants had prepared them [8;\u000d\u000a        pp. 6-7]. From the data it was estimated that over 120 design codes\u000d\u000a      had been Impact census periodprepared between 2006 and 2012 (85% of these\u000d\u000a      after 2008), compared to a smattering before, with the rate of adoption\u000d\u000a      continuing to climb year on year [8; p. 2]. It was found that the\u000d\u000a      research and accompanying guidance was the primary source of advice on the\u000d\u000a      preparation and use of design codes by local authorities and private\u000d\u000a      practitioners alike &#8212; e.g. West Northamptonshire's 2009 Manual for\u000d\u000a        Design Codes; in Plymouth's 2009 Design Code Factsheet; or\u000d\u000a      the 2012 Design Codes for Strategic Development Sites within the\u000d\u000a        Cambridge Fringe Area [9].\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    Taken together, design codes now direct the development of many thousands\u000d\u000a      of houses over many thousands of acres across England. Taking just one\u000d\u000a      local authority as an example, since 2006 Swindon Borough Council has used\u000d\u000a      codes in all four of its major strategic housing sites at Wichelstowe,\u000d\u000a      Tadpole Farm, Commonhead, and New Eastern Villages, covering 14,580 new\u000d\u000a      homes on 1,000+ hectares of land [10].\u000d\u000a    The survey revealed a wide range of projects across England &#8212; from\u000d\u000a      Ashford to Carlisle &#8212; in which respondents reported that the `innovation'\u000d\u000a      of codes had enhanced both process and outcomes. Indeed, 93% of those who\u000d\u000a      used design codes reported they would do so again [8; p. 12]. By\u000d\u000a      2012, design codes were advocated in a quarter of local plans, and the\u000d\u000a      number was rapidly increasing, whilst a large majority of planning\u000d\u000a      authorities and urban design consultants who have had not yet used design\u000d\u000a      codes stated their intention to use them in the future. As one officer\u000d\u000a      said, `codes are the only way to get volume builders to develop out in\u000d\u000a        an appropriate integrated manner' [8; p. 12].\u000d\u000a    As a sign of this significant diffusion of design coding practice, the\u000d\u000a      UDG study revealed that private developers are now submitting unsolicited\u000d\u000a      design codes in large numbers as part of planning applications, indicating\u000d\u000a      how practice has become mainstreamed, whilst survey respondents reported\u000d\u000a      the following benefits of using the codes [8; pp. 1-2]:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Improving design quality by tying down the `must have' design\u000d\u000a        parameters that hold the schemes together, and ensuring consistency in\u000d\u000a        the delivery of key site-wide design principles;\u000d\u000a      Offering far greater certainly about outcomes and certainly to\u000d\u000a        developers about the process;\u000d\u000a      Bringing key stakeholders together early in the process leading to\u000d\u000a        smoother working relationships and to a better understanding of\u000d\u000a        constraints from the start;\u000d\u000a      Speeding up the reserved matters planning applications made in\u000d\u000a        connection with the successive phases of large development projects.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    As one planner put it: `Well framed codes, based on a clear\u000d\u000a        understanding of the limits of the client's control and influence have\u000d\u000a        resulted in a clear uplift in quality, principally in the better\u000d\u000a        integration of complicated development sites or where the landownership\u000d\u000a        is a patchwork.' [8; p. 9].\u000d\u000a    Contributions by UCL research to policy are ongoing. The above diffusion\u000d\u000a      of practice was further advanced by a recommendation of the Taylor External\u000a        Review of Government Planning Practice Guidance (2012) that the\u000d\u000a      underpinning practice guidance should be incorporated into the new National\u000a        Planning Practice Guidance; this was duly done in August 2013 [11;\u000a        ID 26-032-130729].\u000d\u000a    The reach of these impacts was extended further when the research at UCL\u000d\u000a      by Carmona et al inspired the HOPUS consortium of universities and\u000d\u000a      municipalities in the European Union's URBACT programme to focus on the\u000d\u000a      use and potential of design codes as a tool for improving the\u000d\u000a      sustainability of housing development. As its `Lead Expert' through the\u000d\u000a      project's life (2008-10) Carmona advanced the principles and processes of\u000d\u000a      design coding developed during the research as a basis for local\u000d\u000a      investigations in Portugal, Italy, Poland, and The Netherlands, which\u000d\u000a      enabled HOPUS to assess the value of design coding, as well as the\u000d\u000a      conditions necessary for its success [12; p. 6]. In Poland, for\u000d\u000a      example, tests carried out in six cities led to the conclusion that design\u000d\u000a      coding offers a valuable tool to challenge development practice that is\u000d\u000a      typically driven by a private sector with little interest in design\u000d\u000a      quality [11; p. 205].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Work by Carmona et al has supported the national drive for better design\u000d\u000a      in the built environment, helping to mainstream ideas about the importance\u000d\u000a      of urban design and develop tools for design governance.

Over the following\u000d\u000a      decade, research in the UCL Bartlett School of Planning (BSP) provided\u000d\u000a      much of the underpinning research supporting this shift in the areas of\u000d\u000a      design value, street design, public space management, design policy and\u000d\u000a      guidance, the measurement of quality, and the use and utility of design\u000d\u000a      codes. This latter work, led by Professor Matthew Carmona between 2003 and\u000d\u000a      2012, exemplifies the design governance research at UCL.\u000d\u000a    Following interest expressed in the potential of design codes by national\u000d\u000a      government, and consternation in the architectural press about the limits\u000d\u000a      this was perceived to place on design freedom, Carmona led a review of the\u000d\u000a      use and potential of design codes in 2003-04. This study built on\u000d\u000a      Carmona's earlier research on design guidance at UCL and established an\u000d\u000a      analytical framework that moved the discussion away from a preoccupation\u000d\u000a      with aesthetics [a]. Instead, it set the debate on design coding\u000d\u000a      within a larger four-part framework that focused on the fundamental issues\u000d\u000a      of:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      residential development process;\u000d\u000a      key contexts which impact on design coding (i.e. site, policy, market,\u000d\u000a        stakeholder and regulation);\u000d\u000a      the components of place shaped by codes; and\u000d\u000a      potential outcomes from coding (better quality, certainty of process,\u000d\u000a        integration of stakeholder inputs, community engagement, and speed of\u000d\u000a        planning).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Evaluating each of these issues, and their inter-relationships, was vital\u000d\u000a      if the true impact of coding was to be fully understood.\u000d\u000a    It was within this framework that a full-scale national pilot programme\u000d\u000a      to evaluate design coding was commissioned from CABE by Government,\u000d\u000a      beginning in 2004 [b]. This utilised a research methodology\u000d\u000a      developed by Carmona in which each element of the analytical framework was\u000d\u000a      interrogated via seven large scale pilot projects around the country over\u000d\u000a      an 18-month period from 2004-05, alongside nine detailed case studies of\u000d\u000a      coded projects that were already being built. By way of comparison, four\u000d\u000a      schemes that did not use coding, but used other forms of detailed design\u000d\u000a      guidance, were also studied. UCL researchers were embedded within each of\u000d\u000a      the design\/ development teams to observe and record progress and to\u000d\u000a      interview all key stakeholders at different stages of the coding process.\u000d\u000a      Ultimately, the results were drawn together by Carmona who authored the\u000d\u000a      research report [b] published by the Department of Communities and Local\u000d\u000a      Government (DCLG). This resulted in the associated academic publications [a]\u000d\u000a      and [d], the latter of which reviewed and revealed the potential\u000d\u000a      for codes to bring stakeholders together in a more consensus based\u000d\u000a      development process.\u000d\u000a    Carmona was subsequently commissioned by DCLG to author a practice guide\u000d\u000a      for professionals in order to promote the use of design coding in practice\u000d\u000a      and disseminate the research findings. Preparing Design Codes, A\u000d\u000a        Practice Manual remains the key source for practitioners preparing\u000d\u000a      design codes in the UK today [c]. In effect the guide establishes\u000d\u000a      when and when not to use codes and defines an `optimum' design coding\u000d\u000a      processes based on a developed version of the original analytical\u000d\u000a      framework. The process has now become the standard across the UK as\u000d\u000a      revealed in a follow-on project for the Urban Design Group six years\u000d\u000a      later, in 2012. This latest research conducted by Carmona and published in\u000d\u000a      Design Codes, Diffusion of Practice in England involved a national\u000d\u000a      survey of urban design practitioners and local planning authorities [e],\u000d\u000a      and demonstrated the national take-up of coding, following the original\u000d\u000a      research, as an innovation in mainstream development practice, as will be\u000d\u000a      shown below.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36446","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Perhaps the most significant impact of the research described in Section\u000a      2, which underpins all others, is its vital contribution to creating a\u000a      paradigm shift in how people &#8212; and particularly the heritage sector in the\u000a      UK, Europe and the rest of the world &#8212; understand the risks of climate\u000a      change to cultural heritage. Research by CSH was the first to highlight\u000a      these risks and, in so doing, focused attention on both the impacts and\u000a      the mitigation and adaptation strategies needed to safeguard cultural\u000a      heritage from these threats. This research has above all informed\u000a      international policy and for the first time brought to the attention of\u000a      decision makers the potential of damage to cultural heritage across the\u000a      globe from climate change.\u000a    Research by CSH has thus had wide-reaching influence on international and\u000a      national heritage policy, through UNESCO, the Council of Europe and\u000a      English Heritage. Through this means, research has had an impact on many\u000a      of the most important historic properties in the UK, Europe and globally.\u000a      For instance, English Heritage lists 374,081 listed buildings or groups of\u000a      buildings, 19,717 scheduled ancient monuments, 1,601 registered historic\u000a      parks and gardens, 9,080 conservation areas and 17 World Heritage Sites.\u000a      The UNESCO World Heritage List includes 725 cultural properties in 153\u000a      countries. The management of a large proportion of these properties, and\u000a      of listed buildings and World Heritage Sites in particular, is affected by\u000a      the CSH's research findings. As a result, the focus of 'Heritage Counts\u000a      2008', the annual survey of the state of England's historic environment\u000a      produced by English Heritage (who had commissioned the original CHS\u000a      research) on behalf of the Historic Environment Forum was on climate\u000a      change [1].\u000a    This CHS research [b, c] provided the vital evidence on the\u000a      impacts of climate change for international groups involved with heritage\u000a      conservation. Before then heritage managers focussed on average rather\u000a      than extreme climate conditions affecting cultural heritage. This is\u000a      demonstrated by the debate the research instantly occasioned, and its\u000a      subsequent adoption in key international frameworks. For example, the\u000a      Decision at the 31st Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in\u000a      Christchurch, 2007, requested `the World Heritage Centre and the\u000a        Advisory Bodies to integrate policies and strategies established by the\u000a        World Heritage Committee on the issue of climate change in the\u000a        implementation of the strategy for risk reduction at World Heritage\u000a        properties'. In 2008, UNESCO World Heritage Centre published a\u000a      Policy Document on the Impacts of Climate Change on World Heritage\u000a        Properties which referred to CSH research as 'a model for other\u000a        regions of the world' [2; pp. 5-6]. Also in 2008, UNESCO's Management\u000a        Plans for World Heritage Sites: A Practical Guide advised the\u000a      inclusion of reference to climate change impacts: `International\u000a        climate research has shown beyond doubt that climate change is both\u000a        progressing and accelerating ... World Heritage is also affected. If\u000a        effects are visible or feared, observations and counter measures should\u000a        be described in the management plan' [2].\u000a    These were implemented in management plans which took effect during the\u000a      impact period, and UCL research expertise was deployed to support this.\u000a      For example, the 2007 update of the Tower of London World Heritage\u000a        Site Management Plan's Objective 7: Assess the risks to the Tower posed\u000a        by climate change and review the options for mitigation of those effects,\u000a      states that: `Historic Royal Palaces has begun a programme to assess\u000a        the risks of climate change and review the options for mitigation of its\u000a        effects. It is assisting the Centre for Sustainable Heritage, University\u000a        College London, in developing a study to assess risk, and examine\u000a        adaptive capacity.' [3; item 6.4.29].\u000a    In 2008, the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and\u000a      Artistic Works (IIC) also organised a roundtable discussion on `Climate\u000a      Change and Museum Collections' at which this research [b, c] was\u000a      presented as part of the panel of experts. This was the first time that\u000a      awareness of climate change impacts on museum collections was recognised\u000a      at an international level; until then, the focus had been mainly on the\u000a      impacts on buildings and landscapes [4; p.2].\u000a    This research also led the Council of Europe European and Mediterranean\u000a      Major Hazards Agreement (EUR-OPA) to commission a report on the Vulnerability\u000a        of Cultural Heritage to Climate Change (November 2008) followed by a\u000a      workshop which produced a Draft Recommendation on the Vulnerability of\u000a        Cultural Heritage to Climate Change [5]. This draft\u000a      recommendation was approved at the 57th meeting of the Committee of\u000a      Permanent Correspondents (European state parties) of the EUR-OPA Major\u000a      Hazards Agreement (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 15-16 October 2009) [6].\u000a      This agreement is an important platform for co-operation in the field of\u000a      major natural and technological disasters between Europe and the south of\u000a      the Mediterranean. Thus approval meant EU ministerial recognition of the\u000a      risks posed to cultural heritage by climate change. Recognising the\u000a      importance of incorporating this research into practice, the Council of\u000a      Europe sponsored 7 European Master-Doctorate Courses and workshops between\u000a      2007 and 2012, most of which took place within the census period. These\u000a      courses, based on the EUR-OPA report [5] were attended by 152\u000a      postgraduate students from 46 countries who chose to follow research\u000a      careers or professional careers in the heritage sector. The course was\u000a      co-designed by UCL researchers who based their teaching explicitly on\u000a      research into wetting\/drying of historic structures and into the\u000a      adaptation strategies for historic buildings developed at UCL [7].\u000a    In the UK, research has had a significant effect on understanding of the\u000a      impact of climate change on cultural heritage. In Spring 2008, researchers\u000a      were invited by English Heritage to contribute to its Conservation\u000a        Bulletin: A Bulletin of the Historic Environment, which focused on\u000a      the issue of `Adapting to a Changing Climate' [8]. As the leading\u000a      opinion former in heritage circles, English Heritage's Conservation\u000a        Bulletin is published twice a year and is circulated free of charge\u000a      to more than 15,000 conservation specialists, planners, opinion-formers\u000a      and decision-makers throughout the UK and abroad. By presenting research\u000a      by CSH in order to spell out threats and opportunities, it shows how\u000a      English Heritage recommends conservation in the context of climate change.\u000a    The significance of CSH research, and its application to individual\u000a      properties, is demonstrated by the use to which it has been put by\u000a      heritage professionals. The research on the stresses caused by rapid\u000a      drying [a] was conducted in partnership with an insurance company\u000a      and a dehumidification company. Both benefitted commercially from the\u000a      research in ways which exemplify the wider impacts on the sector. As\u000a      indicated in Section 2, insurance companies typically advocate rapid\u000a      drying after flooding so that a building can be brought back into use, a\u000a      belief which was challenged by research. One partner, Ecclesiastical\u000a      Insurance, specialises in heritage insurance in the UK, Ireland, Australia\u000a      and Canada, with a turnover of &#163;497.7 million in 2012. This insurance\u000a      company, in particular, received confirmation of what it had anecdotally\u000a      believed to be the case: as their then Chief Surveyor reported, CSH\u000a      research `provided the evidence Ecclesiastical Insurance needed to\u000a        support its slow approach to drying of flood damaged historic building\u000a        in order to reduce the risk of damage to the structure, fixtures and\u000a        fittings from rapid drying' [9]. This confirmed that\u000a      Ecclesiastical Insurance's advice to its property surveyors was correct\u000a      and that rapid drying of flood damaged properties was to be avoided. The\u000a      involvement in the research project of Historic Scotland's Brodick Castle\u000a      and The National Trust's Blickling Hall, both of which were subject\u000a      respectively to driving rain and flooding due to rainwater run-off, gave\u000a      these two heritage organisations opportunities to further their knowledge\u000a      on the impact of climate change, and in turn, fed into their improved\u000a      management plans. For example, the National Trust has continued its\u000a      scientific research on flooding effects at Blickling Hall, with UCL\u000a      support [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UCL research by Cassar et al has provided the vital evidence to occasion\u000a      a culture change in how heritage professionals nationally and\u000a      internationally approach adaptation to climate change for historic\u000a      properties.

Views have been\u000a      polarised around whether rapid drying to bring buildings back into use\u000a      quickly for economic, health and social reasons would have the unintended\u000a      consequence of long term damage. Research by the Centre for Sustainable\u000a      Heritage (CSH) at the UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment\u000a      specifically addresses the issue that climate change is predicted to\u000a      increase damage to fragile structures as a result of increased flooding\u000a      and fabric saturation, and has demonstrated the effect of forced drying on\u000a      saturated wooden buildings. While it has been known for a long time that\u000a      drying wooden structures too quickly can cause physical stress to the\u000a      fabric, our modelling illustrated how dangerous moisture gradients\u000a      develop.\u000a    Between 2002-03, CSH carried out a scoping study on Climate Change\u000a        and the Historic Environment for English Heritage. This captured,\u000a      for the first time, the observations of heritage managers on the impact of\u000a      climate change on buried archaeology, historic buildings, parks and\u000a      gardens. This was the prelude to two major collaborative projects.\u000a    EPSRC-funded research (2003-06) was driven by the need to understand the\u000a      behaviour of water saturated building fabrics. Conservation advice for the\u000a      drying out of historic buildings was that this process should be carried\u000a      out slowly to avoid hygrothermal stresses in the building fabric. However,\u000a      there is pressure from owners and insurers to dry out buildings rapidly so\u000a      that they can be quickly brought back into use and to restore conditions\u000a      unfavourable to the recurrence of wetting. The research determined the\u000a      stresses in the historic fabric caused by rapid drying compared to the\u000a      extent of related damage such as salt efflorescence that occurs due to\u000a      slow drying. The research modelled the hygrothermal performance of\u000a      historic building fabrics and a Stakeholders Dissemination and Scientific\u000a      Research Report was published [a].\u000a    This was followed by a project funded by the European Commission\u000a      (2004-07) and driven by the need to predict and describe the effects of\u000a      climate change on Europe's built cultural heritage over the next 100\u000a      years, and to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies for the\u000a      historic buildings, sites, monuments and materials likely to be worst\u000a      affected. A Vulnerability Atlas and Adaptation Guidelines for\u000a      heritage managers were produced to enable visualisation of the built\u000a      heritage and cultural landscape under future climate scenarios and to\u000a      model the effects of different adaptation strategies. CSH was responsible\u000a      for modelling the drying of flooded historic wooden buildings under\u000a      different climate scenarios. These research results were published in a\u000a      conference book [b], and in three thematic pages on wetting and\u000a      drying of wood, brick and sandstone in 2010 in The Atlas of Climate\u000a        Change Impact on European Heritage [c]. CSH was also\u000a      responsible for editing and authoring parts of the Adaptation Guidelines\u000a      to support the interpretation of this atlas. The project was conducted in\u000a      collaboration with the Institute for Atmospheric Sciences and Climate\u000a      (Sabbioni, C.; Italian National Research Council) and the School of\u000a      Environmental Sciences (Brimblecombe, P.; University of East Anglia). CSH\u000a      research focused on the impact of climate change on indoor-outdoor\u000a      interactions through the building fabric and on the indoor historic\u000a      environment, while partner teams focused on outdoor heritage.\u000a    UCL researchers in CSH during the time of the underpinning research were:\u000a      Nigel Blades (Lecturer), Phill Biddulph (Research Fellow), May Cassar\u000a      (Professor), Theo Chen (Research Fellow), Robyn Pender (Research Fellow),\u000a      Ian Ridley (Senior Lecturer), Matija Strlic (Senior Lecturer) and Joel\u000a      Taylor (Lecturer).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36485","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The health and wider aspects of low-carbon built environments now feature\u000d\u000a      prominently on political agendas across the world, and the health and\u000d\u000a      energy research by CBES as outlined above has made a major contribution to\u000d\u000a      this state of affairs. It has had direct and significant impacts on the\u000d\u000a      development and revision of guidance, regulation, and policy at regional,\u000d\u000a      national and international levels. This influence has assured subsequent\u000d\u000a      impacts from regional to global levels on the ways in which buildings are\u000d\u000a      currently constructed or are likely to be refurbished, and, in turn, on\u000d\u000a      improvements in human health and wellbeing across the UK and around the\u000d\u000a      world.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on regional policy:\u000d\u000a    CBES work has informed key Greater London Authority (GLA) guidance\u000d\u000a      relating to Urban Heat Islands (UHI), specifically as noted in terms of\u000d\u000a      measures to minimise summer cooling energy demand and health risks, whilst\u000d\u000a      retaining lower winter heating demands and decreased winter health risks\u000d\u000a      due to reduced exposure to cold. In response, the GLA drew upon UCL's\u000d\u000a      research to help produce its key policy document Managing Risks and\u000d\u000a        Increasing Resilience &#8212; The Mayor's Climate Change Adaptation Strategy\u000d\u000a      (2011), which details plans to tackle overheating in London [1].\u000d\u000a      The research has particularly supported the development by the GLA of\u000d\u000a      better evidenced-based policies and programmes to optimise its mix of\u000d\u000a      adaptation and mitigation measures, and to target limited funding as\u000d\u000a      effectively as possible [2].\u000d\u000a    Shaping national policy and practice:\u000d\u000a    CBES research into relative humidity and related growth of mould in\u000d\u000a    dwellings has catalysed and informed important changes in the Building\u000d\u000a    Regulations for England and Wales. In 2010, it resulted in amendments to the\u000d\u000a    moisture criteria guidelines (ADF 2010) for the control of mould growth in\u000d\u000a    dwellings [3]. Fundamental changes were made to the existing\u000d\u000a    guidance, in line with CBES's own research recommendation for its amendment.\u000d\u000a    Those changes included responses to more specific recommendations such as\u000d\u000a    the need to recognise and respond appropriately to the transient nature of\u000d\u000a    mould growth. The research provided policy makers with novel recommendations\u000d\u000a    about the daily, weekly and monthly maximum average levels of relative\u000d\u000a    humidity that should be permissible in dwellings. Changes to ADF 2010 have\u000d\u000a    had a significant impacts on the UK construction industry and, thereby, on\u000d\u000a    the UK population as a whole. Every dwelling constructed in England and\u000d\u000a    Wales since 2010 has been subject to ADF 2010; from 2011 to 2012, this\u000d\u000a    amounted to more than 230,000 households. Following the guidance improves\u000d\u000a    the safety of dwellings and allows house builders to demonstrate the legal\u000d\u000a    requirement for compliance with the Building Regulations.\u000d\u000a    Elsewhere, the research on UHIs (supplemented by further advice from the\u000d\u000a      CBES team) is informing the development by the Chartered Institution of\u000d\u000a      Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) of UHI guidance which will be included\u000d\u000a      in the 8th edition of their Environmental Guide A [4].\u000d\u000a      This important guide, which is currently undergoing substantial revision\u000d\u000a      and is due for release in 2014, will provide a primary reference source\u000d\u000a      for the 19,000+ members of CIBSE.\u000d\u000a    CBES research has also been used to develop new evaluation tools\u000d\u000a      informing further developments in policy and guidance. From 2011,\u000d\u000a      modelling techniques developed over the years by CBES were used in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with colleagues from LSHTM to develop the novel `Health\u000d\u000a      Impacts of Domestic Energy Efficiency Measures' (HIDEEM) tool for the UK\u000d\u000a      Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). This included the\u000d\u000a      construction of micro-environmental stock models to quantify indoor\u000d\u000a      environmental conditions and monetise the health impact associated with\u000d\u000a      energy efficiency changes in houses in Great Britain. These CBES methods\u000d\u000a      employed, for example, empirically derived relationships between house\u000d\u000a      temperatures and measures of energy efficiency, as well as physics based\u000d\u000a      models of pollutant concentrations. HIDEEM informs analyses of the cost\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of relevant policies by evaluating and monetising the health\u000d\u000a      impacts of the large-scale implementation of low energy interventions\u000d\u000a      within dwellings. Since its release in 2012, HIDEEM has been used by\u000d\u000a      DECC's Energy Efficiency Deployment Office (EEDO) to generate health\u000d\u000a      monetisation inputs to its 2012 Energy Efficiency Strategy. This, the\u000d\u000a      first in a series of documents to support the delivery of DECC's energy\u000d\u000a      efficiency policies, relates to and suggests ways to maximise energy\u000d\u000a      efficiency potential across the UK economy. Here, the HIDEEM tool was used\u000d\u000a      specifically to monetise the health impact of wall insulation measures: `DECC\u000a        modelling of the impact of the installation of solid wall insulation in\u000d\u000a        all properties in England gives a total improvement in the health of\u000d\u000a        those individuals in the properties of &#163;3.5bn-&#163;5.0bn over the lifetime\u000d\u000a        of the measures'. The report further notes the potentially\u000d\u000a      significant benefits of such increases in energy efficiency to wellbeing:\u000d\u000a      `a higher disposable income, as a result of lower energy bills, can\u000d\u000a        allow increased spending on other necessities. In addition, the health\u000d\u000a        benefits from properly installed energy efficiency measures can be\u000d\u000a        significant' [5]. DECC has also used the tool to support its\u000d\u000a      2013 Fuel Poverty Framework. That document notes that modelling work\u000d\u000a      carried out using HIDEEM suggests \"substantial health-related costs\u000d\u000a        associated with cold homes\". The influence of that work on the\u000d\u000a      policies set out here is evident as the report continues: `For this\u000d\u000a        reason, we believe that we should continue to prioritise vulnerable fuel\u000d\u000a        poor households for support. In addition, we will continue to build the\u000d\u000a        evidence base on health impacts' [6].\u000d\u000a    International impacts: The reach of these research impacts on\u000d\u000a      construction and human health has been very considerably extended by the\u000d\u000a      further influence of the relative humidity research on international\u000d\u000a      guidelines. In 2008, CBES was invited to provide expert advice to the\u000d\u000a      World Health Organisation (WHO) on best practice in, and the international\u000d\u000a      regulatory framework for, humidity and mould growth. CBES drew on its\u000d\u000a      research work to supply that advice via contributions to two expert\u000d\u000a      meeting reports. These resulted in the publication in 2010 of important\u000d\u000a      new WHO mould guidance documents. This guidance `provides\u000d\u000a        policy-related recommendations and identifies potential ways for\u000d\u000a        international, national and local authorities to prevent, reduce or\u000d\u000a        mitigate exposure to dampness and mould' &#8212; all in order to\u000d\u000a        `enable policy-makers to identify appropriate measures to support and\u000d\u000a        advocate in the field of public health protection and ... provide them\u000d\u000a        with relevant examples and guidance for policy and regulatory measures'\u000d\u000a      [7].\u000d\u000a    More broadly, CBES work has contributed to a fundamental shift in the\u000d\u000a      awareness and understanding among international policy-makers of the\u000d\u000a      possible co-impacts of carbon mitigation measures. Its research\u000d\u000a      elucidating the health impacts of housing energy efficiency interventions\u000d\u000a      [d] has particularly profoundly influenced international awareness\u000d\u000a      of and engagement with the issues it raised. The significance and reach of\u000d\u000a      that influence was demonstrated in statements of support made by the UN\u000d\u000a      Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, WHO Director Margaret Chan, and US\u000d\u000a      Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, all\u000d\u000a      of whom acknowledged the global significance of the research project to\u000d\u000a      which CBES [d] made a substantial contribution at the launch of\u000d\u000a      its findings in December 2009 [8].\u000d\u000a    The expert knowledge of CBES researchers of the specific health impacts\u000d\u000a      of carbon mitigation measures is now being combined with their wider\u000d\u000a      expertise about the impacts of decarbonisation on factors other than\u000d\u000a      health [e]. This combined expertise led, in 2013, to an invitation\u000d\u000a      by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to deliver expert input\u000d\u000a      (alongside DECC) to its `Capturing the Multiple Benefits of Energy\u000d\u000a      Efficiency' initiative. That key input from CBES, which related both\u000d\u000a      specifically to the HIDEEM tool and to wider aspects of the unintended\u000d\u000a      consequences of decarbonisation, has now supported the development of a\u000d\u000a      key IEA Handbook [9].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted by Davies et al within the UCL Bartlett's Complex\u000d\u000a      Built Environment Systems (CBES) group on built environment choices and\u000d\u000a      their implications &#8212; particularly for energy use and health &#8212; has\u000d\u000a      contributed to a fundamental shift in global understanding of the possible\u000d\u000a      health impacts of carbon mitigation measures, and has informed key policy\u000d\u000a      formulation relating to this.

For around a decade, this issue has been the focus of work\u000d\u000a      conducted through a series of funded research projects in the Bartlett's\u000d\u000a      EPSRC Platform-funded Complex Built Environment Systems (CBES) group now\u000d\u000a      led by Professor Mike Davies (who joined UCL in 2004). That group aims\u000d\u000a      particularly to improve understanding of the physical performance of built\u000d\u000a      environment choices and their implications for energy use, health,\u000d\u000a      conservation, productivity and climate change. CBES is primarily\u000d\u000a      interested in developing solutions to the practical problems of designing,\u000d\u000a      constructing, and managing appropriate environments within and around the\u000d\u000a      built environment, and has been at the forefront of vital work associated\u000d\u000a      with the decarbonisation of housing stock. It has demonstrated the\u000d\u000a      potential for such large-scale programmes to produce unintended detriments\u000d\u000a      to health, but also substantial co-benefits. The research outlined here is\u000d\u000a      unified by its shared emphasis on establishing appropriate methods to\u000d\u000a      recognise and minimise the former whilst maximising the latter to produce\u000d\u000a      a simultaneously low-carbon and healthy built environment.\u000d\u000a    Work at CBES on the control of relative humidity in dwellings and the\u000d\u000a      growth of mould through appropriate ventilation responds to tension\u000d\u000a      between the need to maximise ventilation rates in order to reduce\u000d\u000a      the risk of mould growth, and the desire to minimise such airflows\u000d\u000a      in order to reduce energy use\/carbon emissions. Work commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) in 2005 to address\u000d\u000a      the issue of preventing damaging mould growth in dwellings via appropriate\u000d\u000a      ventilation involved a combination of laboratory, modelling and fieldwork.\u000d\u000a      The research demonstrated the need to amend ventilation guidance in the\u000d\u000a      then current Building Regulations, which did not, for example, address the\u000d\u000a      critical importance of the transient nature of mould growth in the most\u000d\u000a      appropriate manner. These and other important research findings were\u000d\u000a      published in outputs offering new recommendations to policy makers for the\u000d\u000a      daily, weekly and monthly maximum average levels of relative humidity that\u000d\u000a      should be permissible in dwellings [a].\u000d\u000a    A second, related strand of CBES work has focussed on the health impacts\u000d\u000a      of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and overheating in dwellings. Responding to\u000d\u000a      the identification by the EPSRC of a key knowledge gap, the investigations\u000d\u000a      by CBES have particularly focused since 2007 on UHIs within London. This\u000d\u000a      work has produced new guidance on the measures that can be used to reduce\u000d\u000a      negative aspects of UHIs (increased summer cooling energy demand and\u000d\u000a      increased summer health risks due to overheating) whilst retaining their\u000d\u000a      beneficial effects (decreased winter heating demand and decreased winter\u000d\u000a      health risks due to reduced exposure to cold). This landmark body of\u000d\u000a      research also studied factors influencing overheating in dwellings and\u000d\u000a      provided guidance relating (amongst others) to: the relative importance of\u000d\u000a      the location of a dwelling in the UHI versus its intrinsic thermal\u000d\u000a      properties; and the impact of interventions on overheating in dwellings [b,\u000a        c].\u000d\u000a    Ground-breaking work conducted since 2009 expanded the remit of the CBES\u000d\u000a      research to a wider treatment of the issue of projected climate change and\u000d\u000a      the impact of energy efficiency interventions in dwellings on exposure to\u000d\u000a      cold, heat and a range of pollutants such as radon, particulates and\u000d\u000a      environmental tobacco smoke. The results were used in a collaborative team\u000d\u000a      led by Professor Paul Wilkinson of the London School of Hygiene and\u000d\u000a      Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to extend the findings of CBES research to the\u000d\u000a      effects of such exposure on health [d]. Further work has also\u000d\u000a      dealt with a wider consideration of the possible unintended consequences\u000d\u000a      of decarbonisation policies [e]. This pioneering holistic approach\u000d\u000a      allowed the team to demonstrate both the dangers of inappropriate policy\u000d\u000a      formulation and implementation, and also the very significant potential\u000d\u000a      co-benefits.\u000d\u000a    CBES researchers involved in UCL research include: Hector\u000d\u000a      Altamirano-Medina (Lecturer), Mark Barrett (Senior Lecturer), Phillip\u000d\u000a      Biddulph (Senior Research Associate), Ben Croxford (Senior Lecturer),\u000d\u000a      Payel Das (Research Associate), Mike Davies (Professor), Steve Evans (RA),\u000d\u000a      Bob Lowe (Professor), Ian Hamilton (Lecturer), Alex Macmillan (SRA), Anna\u000d\u000a      Mavrogianni (Lecturer), Dejan Mumovic (Senior Lecturer), Eleni Oikonomou\u000d\u000a      (RA), Tadj Oreszczyn (Professor), Ian Ridley (Senior Lecturer), Clive\u000d\u000a      Shrubsole (RA), Philip Steadman (Professor) and Marcella Ucci (Lecturer).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36504","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3562981","Name":"Cuba"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research into urban infrastructure at the DPU connects theoretical and\u000d\u000a      policy discourses with action.

This project\u000d\u000a      brought both WaterAid and BPD `significantly further in [their]\u000d\u000a        understanding of the approaches necessary to tackle the issues of water\u000d\u000a        and sanitation services in small towns' [1; p. 32], and\u000d\u000a      defined the areas for `action research' to be taken forward by the two\u000d\u000a      NGOs. Specifically, the research significantly influenced WaterAid's work\u000d\u000a      through their City-Wide Urban Planning for Sanitation and Water\u000d\u000a        Project in Lusaka (Zambia), Maputo (Mozambique), Lagos (Nigeria) and\u000d\u000a      Kinshasa (DR Congo), with that work currently on-track to deliver\u000d\u000a      high-level city planning [2]. It also helped to develop an\u000d\u000a      operational framework to diagnose service delivery in small towns,\u000d\u000a      developing city `typologies' related to demographics, economic drivers,\u000d\u000a      and autonomy in decision-making so as to inform specific intervention\u000d\u000a      strategies and external support programmes. As the project report\u000d\u000a      indicated, WaterAid `intend[s] to test our approach with the ultimate\u000d\u000a        goal of improving the way that WaterAid as an organisation, and the WASH\u000d\u000a        sector at large, addresses small town issues' [1; p. 31].\u000d\u000a      Additionally, the research is being continued through a funded EngD\u000d\u000a      currently being undertaken by Hofmann that is expected to produce a\u000d\u000a      tool-kit which will be used by WaterAid in relation to their work on urban\u000d\u000a      water access [2].\u000d\u000a    DPU's research has influenced the re-tooling and capacity-building of\u000d\u000a      professionals operating in the field, being used to develop reusable\u000d\u000a      training materials to enhance the delivery of capacity development\u000d\u000a      programmes in the Global South. Following from her work [d] with\u000d\u000a      the International Water and Sanitation Centre in 2008, Allen was\u000d\u000a      commissioned in 2009 by UNESCO-IHE, the largest international postgraduate\u000d\u000a      water education facility in the world, based in Delft in The Netherlands,\u000d\u000a      to design and deliver an online training course on policy, planning and\u000d\u000a      methodological aspects of sanitation services in peri-urban regions\u000d\u000a      delivered over a period of four months. According to UNESCO-IHE\u000d\u000a      statistics, this course was received by over 3,000 planning officers and\u000d\u000a      utility managers from all regions of the Global South. Allen's\u000d\u000a      publications on water and sanitation in peri-urban areas, as well as a\u000d\u000a      filmed lecture delivered at UNESCO-IHE in 2008 [7], were key\u000d\u000a      resource materials in this training module. Distance-learning participants\u000d\u000a      use the book published by Springer [c] as the primary resource\u000d\u000a      that gives structure to the programme.\u000d\u000a    In 2012, Allen designed and delivered a component for policymakers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners on water justice, as part of a school on `water governance\u000d\u000a      and the human right to water', organised by the Centro Interdisciplinario\u000d\u000a      de Estudios sobre Desarrollo (CIDER), Universidad de los Andes, and the\u000d\u000a      Municipal Government of Bogot&#225;. This was attended by over 30 policy-makers\u000d\u000a      and practitioners, and has since been developed as a reusable educational\u000d\u000a      resource to train 100 more people (including community leaders) on urban\u000d\u000a      planning approaches to equitable water governance [4]. During\u000d\u000a      2010-12, the DPU team of D&#225;vila, Levy, Cabannes and Allen advised the\u000d\u000a      Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) on the design and\u000d\u000a      implementation of their curriculum on urban settlements and services for\u000d\u000a      working professionals, catering to 1,000 residential students [5].\u000d\u000a    Following research in the transportation strand, D&#225;vila has delivered\u000d\u000a      over 20 lectures in eight countries on the institutional, social, spatial\u000d\u000a      and environmental factors underpinning sustainable pro-poor transport\u000d\u000a      interventions arising from the DPU's work on local governance, urban\u000d\u000a      mobility, and poverty reduction. This has supported a heightened\u000d\u000a      international discussion amongst policy-makers and planners on the\u000d\u000a      linkages between urban mobility and well-being, and has been reflected in\u000d\u000a      increased media attention and high-level workshop events. As an example,\u000d\u000a      in 2011 D&#225;vila and colleagues facilitated an international workshop in\u000d\u000a      Colombia with over 200 participants to reflect upon the case of Medell&#237;n.\u000d\u000a      This outlined the findings described in Section 3, and provided an\u000d\u000a      opportunity for representatives from aid agencies, national governments,\u000d\u000a      municipalities, local communities, academics, students and international\u000d\u000a      experts to share views on the effectiveness of the municipal interventions\u000d\u000a      and assess the potential of applying this model in other cities [6].\u000d\u000a      The discussion gave rise to an international network of policy makers and\u000d\u000a      professionals in urban development to exchange best practices on urban\u000d\u000a      mobility, and led to a major book on the subject aimed at policymakers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners in the Global South [e].\u000d\u000a    This research by Davila and others in DPU attracted widespread interest\u000d\u000a      from government actors aiming to incorporate findings about the impact\u000d\u000a      that a relatively old technology such as cable-cars can have on dense,\u000d\u000a      hilly, low-income urban areas. This input into policy thinking is\u000d\u000a      demonstrated by the fact that, in April 2012, officials in Bogot&#225; and\u000d\u000a      Cali, as well as La Paz in Bolivia, requested copies of the DPU's detailed\u000d\u000a      research reports for each case study. Colombian government officials also\u000d\u000a      requested copies of the final reports, and the book [e] was\u000d\u000a      requested by municipal and national officials in Colombia, Bolivia,\u000d\u000a      Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Cuba, including by Medellin's Metro Company [10].\u000d\u000a      Between 14 December 2012 and 8 November 2013, the Spanish version of the\u000d\u000a      book was accessed 4,264 times from the research website [9]. As\u000d\u000a      municipal interest in aerial cable-cars multiplies around the world, this\u000d\u000a      demand to look at outputs from the DPU's research demonstrates an\u000d\u000a      eagerness to understand the potential economic, social and transport\u000d\u000a      impacts of such systems. The Medell&#237;n model as examined by DPU researchers\u000d\u000a      was also incorporated into international policy-making guides for pro-poor\u000d\u000a      urban upgrading. For instance, it was included in the UN-Habitat Guides\u000d\u000a      and launched at Rio+20 in 2012, and in the International Resource Panel\u000d\u000a      report [3], a clear recognition that urban sustainability requires\u000d\u000a      cities to provide a greater diversity of energy-efficient, low-emission\u000d\u000a      transport with low environmental impact to reduce inequalities.\u000d\u000a    The contribution of DPU research to the global debate on urban transport\u000d\u000a      policy is demonstrated also by its widespread coverage in the popular\u000d\u000a      media. For example, D&#225;vila was interviewed about his research findings for\u000d\u000a      TV and radio in Colombia (Su Madre Naturaleza TV programme;\u000d\u000a      Universidad Nacional Radio, twice) and Mexico (Guadalajara ITESO internet\u000d\u000a      radio), and the reach has been further extended through coverage in major\u000d\u000a      British and North American media outlets with global audiences, such as\u000d\u000a      the BBC World Service and CBC [8].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    DPU's research by Davila, Allen et al into urban infrastructure has\u000d\u000a      generated analytical tools used by policy-makers, practitioners and aid\u000d\u000a      organisations to examine the distribution of and access to urban services.\u000d\u000a      It has supported the development of training curricula used altogether by\u000d\u000a      over 4,000 urban planners in cities of the Global South, and through\u000d\u000a      partners in The Netherlands, India and Colombia.

In the Global South, rapid-paced\u000d\u000a      urbanisation often occurs without adequate investment in infrastructure\u000d\u000a      and basic services, with particularly severe consequences for the millions\u000d\u000a      residing in low-income or unplanned areas. Research in the wider field of\u000d\u000a      urban planning and development has shown that access to infrastructure\u000d\u000a      services is vital to wealth creation, human well-being and environmental\u000d\u000a      sustainability.\u000d\u000a    Through a series of action-research projects with other organisations in\u000d\u000a      the Global South, researchers at the Development Planning Unit (DPU) have\u000d\u000a      (i) documented governance shifts in the production of urban and peri-urban\u000d\u000a      infrastructure; (ii) examined potential and existing non-market based\u000d\u000a      approaches to the provision of universal services; (ii) investigated the\u000d\u000a      effects of infrastructure development on well-being, environmental justice\u000d\u000a      and social inclusion; and (iv) assessed the extent and ways in which\u000d\u000a      infrastructure supports more resilient urban systems. An important\u000d\u000a      contribution by DPU has been in demonstrating the existing efforts of\u000d\u000a      communities to meet their needs, and highlighting where conventional\u000d\u000a      supply-driven and centralised systems of infrastructure provision are\u000d\u000a      inadequate to address the needs of the urban and peri-urban poor.\u000d\u000a    Between 2003 and 2013, researchers examined the governance of water and\u000d\u000a      sanitation services in the peri-urban context. Led by Professor Julio D.\u000d\u000a      D&#225;vila (Head of Department), Dr Adriana Allen (Senior Lecturer) and\u000d\u000a      Pascale Hofmann (Lecturer), a three-year research project in 2003-06,\u000d\u000a      funded by DFID, analysed the access to water and sanitation in\u000d\u000a      metropolitan regions of India, Tanzania, Egypt, Mexico and Venezuela. This\u000d\u000a      produced a path-breaking diagnostic framework to analyse governance\u000d\u000a      approaches to addressing water poverty, from the \"policy-driven\" to the\u000d\u000a      `needs-driven' [a]. Research findings showed that neither\u000d\u000a      centralised supply policies nor the marketplace, such as through\u000d\u000a      large-scale profit-making enterprises, can meet urban needs. Through case\u000d\u000a      studies, the research showed that access is mainly needs-driven and\u000d\u000a      informal, not the result of formal policies. The key to structural\u000d\u000a      improvements in water and sanitation hence lies in the recognition of\u000d\u000a      these practices and their re-articulation under new governance regimes.\u000d\u000a    This framework informed two subsequent projects. A study commissioned in\u000d\u000a      2007-08 by the International Water and Sanitation Centre (IRC) explored\u000d\u000a      approaches to sanitation that work for the urban poor across the urban\u000d\u000a      Global South. Researchers examined hybrid governance arrangements emerging\u000d\u000a      in peri-urban areas and the role of `service co-production' in supporting\u000d\u000a      the urban and peri-urban poor to effectively access sanitation services [b\u000a        + d]. Allen also advised WaterAid and Building Partnerships in\u000d\u000a      Development in Water and Sanitation (BPD) on a project from 2009-10 that\u000d\u000a      examined water and sanitation delivery in small towns, a context often\u000d\u000a      overlooked in current debates. This research examined the opportunities\u000d\u000a      and challenges faced by local governments, utility providers, citizens and\u000d\u000a      external support agencies in six WaterAid country programmes in Asia and\u000d\u000a      Africa. The findings [c] revealed that many existing assistance\u000d\u000a      programmes in small towns result in finance and technology decisions that\u000d\u000a      then dictate planning and design; instead, it is desirable that technology\u000d\u000a      and finance decisions be responsive to circumstances on the ground,\u000d\u000a      particularly how each town is connected demographically, economically and\u000d\u000a      politically to surrounding areas.\u000d\u000a    Access to affordable and efficient transport is another essential need of\u000d\u000a      poor residents in urban areas. DPU researchers have thus also examined the\u000d\u000a      role of progressive local governments in providing improved access to\u000d\u000a      transport infrastructure for excluded low-income populations. Led by\u000d\u000a      Davila, this was the first independent evaluation of an innovative urban\u000d\u000a      upgrading and pro-poor transportation system in Medell&#237;n, Colombia's\u000d\u000a      second largest city, where the world's first modern urban aerial cable-car\u000d\u000a      mass transport system targeted at a low-income area had been implemented [e].\u000d\u000a      Medell&#237;n is fast gaining a reputation for a series of urban interventions\u000d\u000a      backed by solid municipal management, aimed at redressing the city's deep\u000d\u000a      and longstanding social and spatial imbalances. The research contrasted\u000d\u000a      this experience with that of Soacha, a low-income, poorly run municipality\u000d\u000a      near to Bogot&#225;. It documented the institutional genesis and technical\u000d\u000a      features of Medell&#237;n's cable-car lines and examples of innovation and\u000d\u000a      political boldness. For instance, municipal investment in a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      programme of upgrading of the areas served (e.g. social housing, public\u000d\u000a      spaces, new libraries and schools, and training and employment\u000d\u000a      opportunities) had an even wider impact on quality of life than the highly\u000d\u000a      visible and attractive new form of public transport. These public\u000d\u000a      facilities were designed by top architects using high-quality materials in\u000d\u000a      a deliberate reversal of the conventional practice of providing\u000d\u000a      low-quality services to the poor. Using participatory budgeting, whereby\u000d\u000a      residents collectively decide on the use of public investment, city\u000d\u000a      authorities are seeking to change an entrenched culture of patron-client\u000d\u000a      politics.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36542","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The UCL team's objective and empirical research has permitted the\u000d\u000a      creation of vital training and tools for PFI for practitioners in the UK.\u000d\u000a      More broadly, it has shaped the understanding of PFI internationally,\u000d\u000a      particularly in New Zealand, where it assisted in the establishment of a\u000d\u000a      carefully planned PFI framework.

In the first cohort of 23\u000d\u000a      delegates, there were more than 35 ongoing projects under management,\u000d\u000a      ranging from the building of care homes and fire stations to the creation\u000d\u000a      of a major waste-to-energy plant, which could be studied. The projects\u000d\u000a      involved leading commercial companies and banks, and had an estimated\u000d\u000a      total construction cost of over &#163;500m and a total net present value of in\u000d\u000a      excess of &#163;5bn. Two full cohorts completed UCL's PDDP course before it was\u000d\u000a      cancelled in 2010 due to the global financial crisis.\u000d\u000a    Through the PDDP, UCL researchers provided delegates with a clear\u000d\u000a      appreciation of their responsibilities in terms of leading the public\u000d\u000a      sector as a client and commissioner of PFI\/PPP projects, and enabled them\u000d\u000a      to understand the opportunities and barriers driving innovation and risk\u000d\u000a      sharing, and to recognise the importance of managing the relationship as\u000d\u000a      well as highly complex contracts. One example of a direct impact on a\u000d\u000a      delegate was that whilst on the PDDP course they renegotiated a previously\u000d\u000a      poor contract with a consultancy that represented the client. Even with\u000d\u000a      the cancellation of many major projects due to the economic downturn, PDDP\u000d\u000a      had sustained and direct impacts on delegates which enabled them to apply\u000d\u000a      the findings to their future work. As the LGO's Director for the PDDP\u000d\u000a      stated: `I have met a number of delegates who attended the course. All\u000d\u000a        attest to the professional and personal positive impact which the course\u000d\u000a        had upon them. Some have moved on to other projects, having completed\u000d\u000a        those which they were doing during the course ... Others have been\u000d\u000a        promoted within their authority or other authorities, in which they\u000d\u000a        acknowledge that the PDDP played a significant part in having widened\u000d\u000a        their expertise and attitudes' [1]. The course's value was\u000d\u000a      further recognised by its receipt of the 2009 Association for Project\u000d\u000a      Management `BNFL Award' for providing the greatest contribution to the\u000d\u000a      development of project management [2].\u000d\u000a    Building on the success of the PDDP course, in 2009-10 the research team\u000d\u000a      &#8212; together with senior individuals from KPMG and Ashurst LLP (both leading\u000d\u000a      consultancies in PPPs) - developed and delivered a one-day project finance\u000d\u000a      workshop attended by early career professionals in those two companies.\u000d\u000a      Following its initial success, Ashurst LLP went on to run the same\u000d\u000a      workshop for Balfour Beatty annually from 2011 (an estimated 40\u000d\u000a      participants). This workshop also proved to be of significant value to\u000d\u000a      participants, as a Balfour Beatty staff member commented: `It was\u000d\u000a        clear from everyone's enthusiastic participation yesterday afternoon\u000d\u000a        that we all really enjoyed ourselves and certainly learned something in\u000d\u000a        the process ... the feedback in the office this morning is\u000d\u000a        overwhelmingly positive (which is rare for a full day's training!)'\u000d\u000a      [3].\u000d\u000a    (ii) Informing UK debate and policy development: The Knowledge\u000d\u000a      Transfer Project (KTP) from 2009-11 with KMPG played a vital role in\u000d\u000a      answering requests from government and central agencies for a better, more\u000d\u000a      evidence-based analysis of the performance of privately financed projects\u000d\u000a      [e]. A key objective of the KTP was precisely to construct a\u000d\u000a      process of expert discussion. As a result, a collaborative network was\u000d\u000a      formed called the Infrastructure Intelligence Club (IIC); it comprised 16\u000d\u000a      major players in the UK infrastructure investment and PFI\/PPP projects\u000d\u000a      market [4]. Over a series of meetings between 2010 and 2012, the\u000d\u000a      IIC discussed the issues arising from the presentation of the research\u000d\u000a      team's objective analyses carried out on the operational performance of\u000d\u000a      schools and hospitals [e]. As a result, the organisations involved\u000d\u000a      were able to clearly establish empirically based assessments of PFI\/PPP\u000d\u000a      performance and hence put forward the merits of using this form of\u000d\u000a      procurement with a wider public audience, based largely on UCL research.\u000d\u000a    The IIC members met during a time when PFI\/PPP was receiving significant\u000d\u000a      negative press attention in the UK. The objective empirical work presented\u000d\u000a      and discussed by IIC members revealed that the overall operational\u000d\u000a      performance of PFI\/PPP school and hospital projects was not as dire as\u000d\u000a      commonly portrayed. As part of this debate, in 2010 The Times\u000d\u000a      published an article on 'PFI-funded hospitals outshine peers in study of\u000d\u000a      cleanliness' which covered the empirical research from the KTP run by UCL\u000d\u000a      [5]. Public concerns over PFI led to various investigations,\u000d\u000a      including one in 2012 by the charity Civitas, which moderated its argument\u000d\u000a      against PFI financing again based, at least in part, on the UCL research [6;\u000d\u000a        pp. 2-3].\u000d\u000a    The empirical analyses produced on UK PFI\/PPP performance were considered\u000d\u000a      as part of the strategic review of PFI\/PPP conducted by HM Treasury in\u000d\u000a      2011-12. This review also involved gathering views from many varied\u000d\u000a      sources, including some IIC network members, such as KPMG. The IIC members\u000d\u000a      argued that there were public sector benefits from using PFI\/PPP, drawing\u000d\u000a      heavily on evidence produced by the UCL research [7]. In December\u000d\u000a      2012, HM Treasury published its decision, not to scrap PFI\/PPP &#8212; as much\u000d\u000a      of the popular press had predicted &#8212; but to modify it and rename it as\u000d\u000a      `PF2'. Also in late-2012, the UCL team was invited by The Infrastructure\u000d\u000a      Forum (TIF), a national infrastructure think-tank, to write a report\u000d\u000a      comparing the performance of public and private hospital services in the\u000d\u000a      UK, aimed at senior policy and industry circles [8].\u000d\u000a    (iii) Influencing the strategic development and current understanding\u000d\u000a        of PFI internationally:\u000d\u000a      New Zealand had historically been extremely wary of using PFI to procure\u000d\u000a      its infrastructure. In 2008, however, following a change of government\u000d\u000a      there that was willing to consider the use of PFI\/PPP &#8212; but only after\u000d\u000a      having first fully explored and understood its ramifications. The\u000d\u000a      embryonic PPP market was established in New Zealand in 2009 with the\u000d\u000a      announcement of the Transmission Gully road project. Noting this\u000d\u000a      development, Edkins made contact with the New Zealand Council for\u000d\u000a      Infrastructure Development (NZCID), and proposed designing and delivering\u000d\u000a      an executive level seminar series to provide a strategic overview and\u000d\u000a      insight into the fundamental principles and practice associated with PFI,\u000d\u000a      including the wider use of Public Private Partnerships (PPP). These\u000d\u000a      workshops were brought to the attention of the New Zealand Treasury, which\u000d\u000a      offered its formal support to this initiative as an important means of\u000d\u000a      ensuring that the implementation of PFI in New Zealand learned from best\u000d\u000a      practices whilst avoiding errors made elsewhere.\u000d\u000a    As a result, in 2010 and 2011 two executive level seminar series were\u000d\u000a      delivered in Auckland and Wellington (a total of four separate three-day\u000d\u000a      seminars) attended by about 200 senior delegates in total, from both\u000d\u000a      industry and government [9]. The workshops involved presentations\u000d\u000a      that drew on the accumulated knowledge originating in the UCL team's\u000d\u000a      research [a-d], as well as the ongoing UCL research through the\u000d\u000a      KTP with KPMG [e]. As a representative of the New Zealand Treasury\u000d\u000a      noted, they `took place during the establishment of NZ's PPP programme\u000d\u000a        and assisted with educating the NZ public sector in the overseas\u000d\u000a        experience of the PPP model (with which they were not generally\u000d\u000a        familiar). It was useful to the NZ Treasury through assisting with the\u000d\u000a        development of the market and providing an opportunity to test and\u000d\u000a        challenge our own thinking' [10].\u000d\u000a    This work in New Zealand also resulted in the UCL research team being\u000d\u000a      invited in early 2012 to hold a formal meeting and make a written\u000d\u000a      submission to the Western Australian Public Accounts Committee, which was\u000d\u000a      then conducting a review of a PPP project. The research team was formally\u000d\u000a      thanked by this organisation for assisting its investigation into the\u000d\u000a      allocation of services at the Fiona Stanley Hospital Murdoch, located 15\u000d\u000a      kilometres south of Perth, Western Australia [11].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at UCL by Edkins, Ive et al, commencing in 1996, into the\u000d\u000a      Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Public Private Partnership (PPP) has\u000d\u000a      resulted in an independent and objective commentary on the use and\u000d\u000a      practicalities of this procurement framework.

The primary insight from the body of\u000d\u000a      UCL research work relates to the potential for, and need to, consider the\u000d\u000a      financing the full project life-cycle &#8212; i.e. from project creation to\u000d\u000a      sustained operational use through the contractual integration of the\u000d\u000a      design, build, operation and financing of the facility.\u000d\u000a    In 1994 Graham Ive, Senior Lecturer in the School of Construction and\u000d\u000a      Project Management (BSC&amp;PM) at the UCL Bartlett Faculty of the Built\u000d\u000a      Environment, was appointed to the Construction Industry Council (CIC)\u000d\u000a      Procurement Advisory Panel. From accessing this network of experts a\u000d\u000a      competitive grant was won under the Partners in Technology\u000d\u000a      programme, funded by the then Department for Environment, Transport and\u000d\u000a      the Regions (DETR). The research project's objective was to investigate\u000d\u000a      PFI in terms of its process and implications from the perspective of the\u000d\u000a      community of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) that comprise a\u000d\u000a      large proportion of the UK construction sector. This initial project was\u000d\u000a      conducted by Graham Ive and Dr Andrew Edkins (then Senior Research Fellow,\u000d\u000a      now Senior Lecturer) between 1996 and 1997. The research involved a clear\u000d\u000a      articulation of the drivers of PFI and the processes it involves, gathered\u000d\u000a      from leading practitioners in the early use of PFI and its forerunners. In\u000d\u000a      1998, this led to the publication of an important book which independently\u000d\u000a      and objectively described PFI, and what it consisted, of to a construction\u000d\u000a      industry audience for the first time [a].\u000d\u000a    A second competitive grant for Partners in Innovation, also\u000d\u000a      funded by DETR, was awarded in 1998 to investigate the implications of the\u000d\u000a      use of PFI on cost saving and innovation. Ive and Edkins led this project,\u000d\u000a      with Germ&#225;n Milan as Research Fellow. This research concluded that there\u000d\u000a      was no overwhelming evidence of cost saving from the use of PFI, and that\u000d\u000a      the incentive to innovate was context dependent, critically involving the\u000d\u000a      level of competition during bidding [b].\u000d\u000a    As a result of this early work, UCL researchers continued investigations\u000d\u000a      that led in 2006 to a further publication which developed and applied\u000d\u000a      theories of transaction cost and asset specificity in the context of PFI,\u000d\u000a      through use of Transaction Cost Economics and Relationship Contracting\u000d\u000a      perspectives [c]. Specific insights were provided by two detailed\u000d\u000a      case studies of the King's College London Hospital and UCL Hospital\u000d\u000a      building contracts, and served to show that longer-term contracts do allow\u000d\u000a      for parties to benefit by economising on transaction costs. In addition to\u000d\u000a      this economics-orientated research, Edkins and Dr Hedley Smyth undertook a\u000d\u000a      relational management research project on the role that PFI\/PPP plays in\u000d\u000a      changing how contracting parties interact and relate, and how\u000d\u000a      relationships can best be managed [d]. This research revealed the\u000d\u000a      differing strengths and types of trust within a PFI consortium and\u000d\u000a      externally with its public sector client.\u000d\u000a    In 2009, researchers embarked on a strategic partnership between UCL and\u000d\u000a      KPMG which has led to four research-driven, practitioner-targeted reports,\u000d\u000a      as well as two academic conference papers. This two-year Knowledge\u000d\u000a      Transfer Partnership (KTP) led by Edkins and Ive, with Alex Murray as\u000d\u000a      researcher, had the remit to develop methods and collate data to enable\u000d\u000a      benchmarking of the operational performance of privately financed social\u000d\u000a      infrastructure projects, focussing on PFI schools and hospitals. This work\u000d\u000a      developed methods to collate and analyse public and quasi-public data from\u000d\u000a      diverse sources and empirically test propositions in the influential\u000d\u000a      economics literature on PFI-style contracts concerning expected operating\u000d\u000a      cost savings as well as implications for facility quality [e].\u000d\u000a    Hence the research work has been led by Graham Ive (Senior Lecturer at\u000d\u000a      UCL from 1995 to present) and Dr Andrew Edkins (Researcher and Lecturer at\u000d\u000a      UCL 1996-99, Senior Lecturer from 2004 to present, and currently Head of\u000d\u000a      Department in BSC&amp;PM), with input from Germ&#225;n Millan (Research\u000d\u000a      Assistant from 1997-2000), Hedley Smyth (Senior Lecturer from 2004 and now\u000d\u000a      Director of Research), and Alex Murray (Research Associate from 2009 to\u000d\u000a      present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36791","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Graz is Austria's second largest city, and the federal capital of the\u000d\u000a      Styria region. The Kunsthaus\u000d\u000a      opened in 2003, the year in which the city was awarded the status of\u000d\u000a      `European Capital of Culture'.\u000d\u000a      Since then, the Kunsthaus Graz has contributed to regenerating the city's\u000d\u000a      cultural and economic\u000d\u000a      esteem in Austria, Europe and globally. These major impacts have continued\u000d\u000a      and indeed\u000d\u000a      increased since 2008, both in terms of economic influence by establishing\u000d\u000a      Graz as an international\u000d\u000a      arts capital for specialist and non-specialist visitors, and terms of in\u000d\u000a      providing the city, and the\u000d\u000a      country, with an unique and powerful architectural emblem for the 21st\u000d\u000a      century.\u000d\u000a    The `biomorphic' design of the Kunsthaus has therefore raised the\u000d\u000a      cultural value of architecture in\u000d\u000a      Graz and its region, contributing to its international reputation as a\u000d\u000a      locus for new architecture.\u000d\u000a      Within the history of iconic cultural buildings, it can be situated\u000d\u000a      between the Guggenheim Museum\u000d\u000a      in Bilbao (Frank Gehry, 1997) and the MAXXI National Museum of Modern Art\u000d\u000a      in Rome (Zaha\u000d\u000a      Hadid, 2010). Its role as a world-class architectural exemplar was central\u000d\u000a      to Graz's selection in\u000d\u000a      2011 as an UNESCO `City of Design', the testimonial for which cited the\u000d\u000a      Kunsthaus as `among the\u000d\u000a        city's most prominent pieces of architecture and is considered\u000d\u000a        internationally to be one of the most\u000d\u000a        discussed contemporary exhibition buildings' [1; pp. 23-24].\u000d\u000a    The success of the building's innovative design in achieving a complex\u000d\u000a      double-curved geometry\u000d\u000a      has undoubtedly contributed to its worldwide fame. Its fa&#231;ade, which is\u000d\u000a      skilfully integrated into the\u000d\u000a      outer skin of the building, has been used as a key `performative' medium\u000d\u000a      through which to display\u000d\u000a      the museum's curatorial programme directly into the streets around,\u000d\u000a      thereby turning this quarter of\u000d\u000a      the city into a living capital of culture [3, 4, 5].\u000d\u000a    Thanks to this innovative and recognisable design, since 2008 the museum\u000d\u000a      has been used, almost\u000d\u000a      exclusively, as the iconic image of Graz in international tourist\u000d\u000a      literature, the broadsheet press and\u000d\u000a      media, and even crossing over to publications in\u000d\u000a      building technology, computer science, arts,\u000d\u000a      museology, urbanism, conservation and popular\u000d\u000a      culture. This includes a 50-minute documentary film by\u000d\u000a      coop99 and Wien Film in 2012 - titled Kunsthaus Graz - A\u000d\u000a        Friendly Alien &#8212; which contains interviews with two\u000d\u000a      leading Austrian architects, G&#252;nther Domenig and\u000d\u000a      Volker Gienke, and the Kunsthaus's former Director,\u000d\u000a      Peter Pakesch. The Kunsthaus, as the synonymous\u000d\u000a      image of Graz, and of Austria more generally, has\u000d\u000a      been celebrated in many ways: for instance, a\u000d\u000a      standard-letter postage stamp issued in 2011; the\u000d\u000a      front-page banner image for the Graz Municipality's\u000d\u000a      website; the opening credits for daily news programme on Graz TV; and\u000d\u000a      reviews broadcast by\u000d\u000a      CNN on 9 October 2008 (`10 of the World's `Blobbiest' Buildings') and by\u000d\u000a      Graz TV on 6 August\u000d\u000a      2013. For Graz's umbrella organisation for cultural heritage, called the Johanneum,\u000d\u000a      the museum\u000d\u000a      continues to provide significant ongoing value as its leading public\u000d\u000a      `brand image' [10]. The\u000d\u000a      Johanneum has even developed a mobile phone app, the `Kunsthaus App',\u000d\u000a      which includes an\u000d\u000a      illustrated guide to the building with a German\/English architectural tour\u000d\u000a      for adults and a\u000d\u000a      German-language-only guide for children [4].\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000a    The local tourist board, Graz Tourismus, has stated that the city's\u000d\u000a      museum visitor numbers\u000d\u000a      increased dramatically to teach 70-80,000 per annum by 2008 [6].\u000d\u000a      More recently, the organisation\u000d\u000a      notes that total visitor numbers to the city has continued to rise\u000d\u000a      steadily, reaching a high-point of\u000d\u000a      800,000 `overnight stays' in 2011 [9, 10]. The central role of the\u000d\u000a      Kunsthaus in this sudden increase\u000d\u000a      is demonstrated by the fact that the building receives a much higher\u000d\u000a      percentage of the city's\u000d\u000a      cultural tourists than do comparable museums in other renowned `cultural'\u000d\u000a      cities, such as\u000d\u000a      Barcelona [6 - see also 4, 5]. Between 2008 and 2011, the\u000d\u000a      Kunsthaus Graz received an average\u000d\u000a      of 69,826 visitors per annum, equal to an astonishing 87.2% of the total\u000d\u000a      cultural tourism in the city.\u000d\u000a      The museum's own market research, conducted in 2008, has shown that the\u000d\u000a      building's bold design\u000d\u000a      is key to its economic and cultural success, with 79.1% of visitors\u000d\u000a      considering the tours of the\u000d\u000a      architecture itself to be either `very important' or `important' [2;\u000d\u000a        p. 13].\u000d\u000a    Furthermore, the Kunsthaus was purposely located in a historically\u000d\u000a      deprived part of Graz, but\u000d\u000a      through its performative fa&#231;ade it has become consciously integrated into\u000d\u000a      the lived life around it.\u000d\u000a      The building has hence since been instrumental in the economic and social\u000d\u000a      regeneration of this\u000d\u000a      previously rundown district. During the REF impact period, some 21 new\u000d\u000a      businesses have opened\u000d\u000a      locally &#8212; these include 3 offices\/creative studios; 5 cafes\/restaurants;\u000d\u000a      11 fashion\/retail outlets, and\u000d\u000a      2 galleries. In addition, in 2008 the House of Architecture, a major local\u000d\u000a      cultural institution,\u000d\u000a      relocated next door into the renovated Palais Thienfeld [7 - see also\u000d\u000a        5, 9]. Duly, the city's\u000d\u000a      successful application to become an UNESCO `City of Design' stated: `It\u000d\u000a        is not a coincidence that\u000d\u000a        more and more creative businesses have settled in the area around the\u000d\u000a        Kunsthaus Graz ... having\u000d\u000a        profited from the revival of this area that had until just recently been\u000d\u000a        considered by the general\u000d\u000a        public as rather underprivileged' [1; p. 23].\u000d\u000a    Market research into the cultural value of the Kunsthaus has also\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the success of the\u000d\u000a      site-specific interaction between the building and its exhibition\u000d\u000a      programmes [2, 10]. The building\u000d\u000a      itself has impacted on the visual arts, and on museum and curatorial\u000d\u000a      working practices. It has\u000d\u000a      enabled new approaches by its curatorial team in terms of design, display\u000d\u000a      and operation, gaining\u000d\u000a      international recognition for site-specific curation within contemporary\u000d\u000a      art museums [3, 4, 10]. The\u000d\u000a      building's `anti-white-box' design has continuously underpinned curatorial\u000d\u000a      strategies for exhibiting\u000d\u000a      post-1960 avant-garde art and design (e.g. Life: Biomorphic Form in\u000d\u000a        Sculpture, 2009; Capital +\u000d\u000a        Code, 2009; Human Condition: Empathy and Emancipation in\u000d\u000a        Precarious Times, 2010; Robot\u000d\u000a        Dreams, 2010). Its former lead curator, Adam Budak, highlighted its\u000d\u000a      catalytic role for `anti-modern'\u000d\u000a      curatorial methods [3] in the press release that accompanied the\u000d\u000a      2011 exhibition on `Anti\/Form', by\u000d\u000a      noting that `this building [is] triggering new ways of thinking',\u000d\u000a      and adding `we quite consciously\u000d\u000a        selected this particular group of sculptures for the Kunsthaus Graz, a\u000d\u000a        building designed ... in the\u000d\u000a        spirit of the Archigram group' [8].\u000d\u000a    Also notable is that these innovations at the Kunsthaus Graz in\u000d\u000a      architecturally responsive curatorial\u000d\u000a      practice have been applied to other projects elsewhere, especially by its\u000d\u000a      former Director, Peter\u000d\u000a      Pakesch (who is now the overall Director for all of Graz's museums) and by\u000d\u000a      Adam Budak, who has\u000d\u000a      since been awarded international appointments for Manifesta 2008\u000d\u000a      and for a period was a curator\u000d\u000a      at The Smithsonian Hirschhorn Museum in Washington, DC. Each of these\u000d\u000a      figures, plus other\u000d\u000a      colleagues, have been able to use the groundbreaking curatorial techniques\u000d\u000a      developed in the\u000d\u000a      Kunsthaus Graz in their subsequent careers [3, 4].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Kunsthaus in Graz, Austria, which emerged from UCL research by Cook\u000d\u000a      and Fournier, and\u000d\u000a      opened in 2003, has had a substantial and sustained impact on the city.\u000d\u000a      Indeed, it has become a\u000d\u000a      key symbol in Graz and a major contributor to tourism and increased\u000d\u000a      visitor figures due to its\u000d\u000a      innovative and iconic design.

This has helped define its international reputation for design\u000d\u000a      research. A leading example\u000d\u000a      of this is when Sir Peter Cook (Bartlett Professor of Architecture, and\u000d\u000a      Chair of the Bartlett School of\u000d\u000a      Architecture from 1990-2006) and Colin Fournier (Professor of Architecture\u000d\u000a      and Urbanism at the\u000d\u000a      Bartlett since 1998) won a global competition in 2000 to design a major\u000d\u000a      new art museum for the\u000d\u000a      city of Graz, Austria [a]. Over a four-year period, they designed\u000d\u000a      and implemented the construction\u000d\u000a      of the Kunsthaus, working with Frankfurt-based structural engineers\u000d\u000a      Bollinger+Grohmann. The\u000d\u000a      resulting building, which opened in 2003, is widely regarded as a seminal\u000d\u000a      contribution to the\u000d\u000a      development of iconic modern art museums in Europe, especially in terms of\u000d\u000a      its `biomorphic'\u000d\u000a      building typology (overall design) and use of interactive building\u000d\u000a      technology (media fa&#231;ade).\u000d\u000a    This dramatic new art museum relates also to Graz's Baroque artistic,\u000d\u000a      architectural and urban\u000d\u000a      heritage\/context (including the mid-20th century `Grazer Schule' tradition\u000d\u000a      of architecture and urban\u000d\u000a      design, especially Gunther Domenig's work) as well as to the lineage of\u000d\u000a      international art museums\u000d\u000a      that challenge the modernist `white cube' conventions (e.g. the Georges\u000d\u000a      Pompidou Centre, Paris,\u000d\u000a      and the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao). [b] The Kunsthaus Graz hence\u000d\u000a      uses contemporary\u000d\u000a      curatorial methodologies, which reflect the building's typological\u000d\u000a      uniqueness and interactive\u000d\u000a      elements, to display artistic practices that are site-specific,\u000d\u000a      performative and decidedly avant-garde.\u000d\u000a    The research for the Kunsthaus also employed technical design innovations\u000d\u000a      that resulted in a\u000d\u000a      building which is formally original and has an interactive exterior\u000d\u000a      envelope that is integral to the\u000d\u000a      building's design, function, and `performativity'. Its external skin\u000d\u000a      provides a unique interface for\u000d\u000a      displaying contemporary art directly onto the street. [c, d] This\u000d\u000a      integration of contemporary art\u000d\u000a      displays into the innovative design and fabrication of the building was\u000d\u000a      achieved by various means:\u000d\u000a    (i) Creating a design for a complex double-curved exterior envelope that\u000d\u000a      required specially pre-fabricated\u000d\u000a      3D modelled panels as part of the design team's vision for non-standard\u000d\u000a      geometric\u000d\u000a      design processes based on advanced digital techniques.\u000d\u000a    (ii) Employing CAD-CAM construction processes and design-to-production\u000d\u000a      tool-chain methods\u000d\u000a      which &#8212; working in collaboration with the local building industry &#8212;\u000d\u000a      enabled cost-effective\u000d\u000a      manufacturing techniques for the structural elements and double-curved\u000d\u000a      outer skin. As such, the\u000d\u000a      Kunsthaus was the first permanent building structure to have an overall\u000d\u000a      envelope made out of\u000d\u000a      translucent, individually formed double-curved elements. This technology\u000d\u000a      for the skin also enabled\u000d\u000a      the development of a system of mechanical fixing points that adjust to the\u000d\u000a      high thermal expansion\u000d\u000a      coefficient and structural properties of thermoplastic materials.\u000d\u000a    (iii) Researching, along with Realities United in Berlin, into different\u000d\u000a      concepts of electronic visual\u000d\u000a      displays to design and the construct the interactive, `performative' media\u000d\u000a      fa&#231;ade as part of the\u000d\u000a      building's external skin; this was achieved as it was seen as better than\u000d\u000a      using a whole series of\u000d\u000a      discrete screens to make up the skin. It also enabled the cost-effective\u000d\u000a      integration of large-scale\u000d\u000a      `pixels' into a double-curved fa&#231;ade, the novel use of tuneable\u000d\u000a      fluorescent lighting with fast\u000d\u000a      response time so they could be used for display purposes, and the\u000d\u000a      development of specific user\u000d\u000a      interfaces to increase public interaction.\u000d\u000a    (iv) Integrating the building's heating and air-conditioning system into\u000d\u000a      the thermal performance of\u000d\u000a      the external skin by designing an energy-exchange mechanism which uses\u000d\u000a      water from the\u000d\u000a      adjacent Mur River to help to cool the interior of the Kunsthaus. The\u000d\u000a      permeable, layered structure\u000d\u000a      of the building envelope is therefore also an active element in the\u000d\u000a      heating, ventilating and cooling\u000d\u000a      system, and this was only achieved in practice by a thoroughgoing\u000d\u000a      pre-testing of thermal effects on\u000d\u000a      the translucent thermoplastic panels that constitute the top layer of its\u000d\u000a      rear-vented fa&#231;ade.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36837","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The UCL research has underpinned the development of original artistic and\u000a      cultural artefacts that\u000a      are valued highly by both the public and private sectors, and which are\u000a      making an important\u000a      contribution to the global profile of British innovation in architecture\u000a      and design. Although\u000a      impossible to quantify, it has nonetheless delivered significant financial\u000a      impacts via its influence on\u000a      major projects by leading architectural practices, as well as on the\u000a      formation of innovative young\u000a      design studios. The following examples illustrative some of the ways in\u000a      which the research has\u000a      underpinned these important outcomes:\u000a    (i) Contributions to major architectural projects: The research\u000a      has supported the delivery of\u000a      major architectural projects run by some of the UK's best known\u000a      architectural and design\u000a      practitioners, including globally renowned London practice, Wilkinson Eyre\u000a      Architects, which has\u000a      twice won the RIBA Stirling Prize (2001, 2002). Several of the company's\u000a      110 staff (including\u000a      former BIAW researcher Matthew Potter, now an Associate Director) identify\u000a      Gage's research as\u000a      an important influence, and core elements of that research are evident in\u000a      some of the company's\u000a      biggest projects. Thus its environmentally responsive conservatories for\u000a      `Gardens by the Bay'\u000a      (Singapore's iconic park) deployed a tiered approach to energy-use by\u000a      using shades responsive to\u000a      their local climate conditions to regulate the building's internal thermal\u000a      levels. This use of solar\u000a      responsive technologies reflects the insights published in [c],\u000a      and Wilkinson Eyre acknowledges\u000a      the direct influence of Gage's research legacy upon projects such as these\u000a      [1].\u000a    Flanagan Lawrence (formerly BFLS Architects) likewise cites the influence\u000a      of the research on work\u000a      such as their [text removed for publication] Soundforms project in\u000a      Cardiff, completed in 2011. The\u000a      work done here on sound and performance by the Associate Director of\u000a      Flanagan Lawrence, a\u000a      former BIAW researcher, fed directly into the Cardiff scheme, wherein `adaptive\u000a        technologies and\u000a        digital prototyping were used for the development of the acoustic\u000a        panels' and `generative software\u000a        was used to optimise the layout and position of the panels to meet the\u000a        acoustic requirements' [2].\u000a    (ii) Formation of innovative design studios producing original\u000a        artistic and cultural artefacts:\u000a      Gage's work has catalysed the institution of numerous commercially and\u000a      artistically successful\u000a      design firms. The influence of BIAW research on interactive, responsive\u000a      and performative\u000a      architectural design is much in evidence in the work of the these\u000a      companies, with most of them\u000a      specialising in the development of responsive architectural elements such\u000a      as interactive facades,\u000a      modulated lighting and motion-sensing components, and in the provision of\u000a      immersive and large-\u000a      scale landscape installations for public and private clients. The\u000a      resultant designs are finding favour\u000a      among consumers in both the public and private sectors, and in doing so\u000a      are contributing directly\u000a      to the global profile of British innovation in architectural design.\u000a    Jason Bruges Studio was established in 2001 partly to commercialise BIAW\u000a      research techniques,\u000a      especially vision systems, low-cost actuation and control\u000a      hardware\/software, and digital prototype\u000a      fabrication. The company, which now employs more than 20 staff, has\u000a      deployed these techniques\u000a      in international projects and installations [text removed for publication]\u000a      between 2008-13, including\u000a      the development of the changing lighting facade on the W Hotel in\u000a      Leicester Square (2010) and an\u000a      installation for San Diego International Airport, USA (2012). The\u000a      influence of the research is\u000a      explicitly acknowledged by the firm, who state: `The research\u000a        environment, both in the Bartlett\u000a        Interactive Architecture Workshop and the Bartlett Digital Fabrication\u000a        Workshop, has had a\u000a        considerable impact on the success of the Jason Bruges Studio' [3].\u000a      The extent of this influence on\u000a      Bruges, who worked for many years alongside Gage, is evident in Ariel\u000a        Dynamics, an interactive\u000a      sound-and-light `bubble', fully immersive installation developed for the\u000a      2012 Olympics Park.\u000a      Commissioned by Coca-Cola, Ariel Dynamics used people-tracking LED\u000a      sensors in 180\u000a      polypropylene `bubbles' responding to the `chink' of glasses. Its design\u000a      was underpinned by Gage's\u000a      research on social cybernetics and agent-based responsivity, and was\u000a      described by the firm as `a\u000a        practical substantiation of the arguments put forward by Prof Gage in\u000a        his paper, \"The Wonder of\u000a        Trivial Machines\"' [3].\u000a    It likewise underpinned the establishment in 2003 of Haque Design +\u000a      Research Ltd by another\u000a      former BIAW member, Usman Haque. The practice has since developed\u000a      cutting-edge,\u000a      experimental interactive architectural designs incorporating responsive\u000a      environments, interactive\u000a      components, digital interface devices, and mass-participation initiatives.\u000a      Expertise developed\u000a      within the BIAW allows Haque to employ technologies including wearable\u000a      computing, mobile\u000a      connectivity, people-centred design, and ubiquitous `cloud' computing. The\u000a      company's director\u000a      acknowledges `the considerable contribution that the research\u000a        environment of ... the Bartlett\u000a        Interactive Architecture Workshop has had in the development and success\u000a        of my design practice\u000a        ... In cultivating a forum for radically new, but explicitly practical,\u000a        approaches in architecture [it] has\u000a        particularly influenced my work on `open source architecture' [4].\u000a    Sixteen* makers are an experimental architectural practice with a\u000a      particular interest in `design\u000a      through making', where the nature and properties of materials combine with\u000a      a site's environmental\u000a      conditions to inform their design process and eventually produce\u000a      `responsive architecture'. Phil\u000a      Ayres drew on the research in producing the experimental sixteen* makers\u000a      installation called 55\/02\u000a      in Kielder Forest, Northumbria (2009). Designed and built with Nick\u000a      Callicott, Chris Leung and\u000a      Professor Bob Sheil (co-owner of sixteen* makers and Director of\u000a      Architectural Technology at the\u000a      Bartlett), 55\/02 used environmental sensing to explore principles of\u000a      site-specificity and adaptive\u000a      behaviour. The influence of Gage's work on interactive technologies,\u000a      feedback systems,\u000a      performative elements and time-based architecture is evident in the use in\u000a      55\/02 of sophisticated\u000a      environmental sensory devices to respond to its environment and to weather\u000a      conditions [d].\u000a    (iii) Impacts on culture, well-being and the economy: The\u000a      production of original artistic and\u000a      cultural artefacts by companies founded on or using UCL research has\u000a      important benefits to\u000a      cultural life, not just in the UK but also in the many countries around\u000a      the world where those projects\u000a      are realised. Some of those projects, moreover, deliver significant\u000a      additional benefits, including\u000a      supporting improved health and wellbeing. The Nature Trail by Jason Bruges\u000a      Studio, completed in\u000a      2012 for the new Morgan Stanley Clinical Building at Great Ormond Street\u000a      Hospital (GOSH),\u000a      London, provides one notable example. This interactive `wallpaper'\u000a      installation was designed\u000a      specifically to support the `patient journey' from ward to theatre for\u000a      children aged 6 months to 18\u000a      years. The installation drew heavily on Gage's research into the ways in\u000a      which design can be\u000a      `environmentally' responsive to its local conditions, and through which\u000a      interactive and responsive\u000a      architectures can enhance the user's well-being [a, b].\u000a      Synthesised in uniquely accessible, child-\u000a      centred graphic wallpaper, patients, parents and health-workers are able\u000a      to find responsive LED\u000a      image-panels of animals that are `hidden' in the `natural canvas' of the\u000a      wood, allowing young\u000a      patients to be fascinated and distracted during their stay in hospital [5].\u000a    In some cases, projects generated using the research have delivered very\u000a      significant economic\u000a      benefits. Recent examples include Pachube, an open-source, real-time\u000a      environmental data\u000a      infrastructure and online community designed by Haque Design + Research\u000a      between 2009 and\u000a      2011.The software allows individuals to store, share and discover\u000a      real-time sensor, energy and\u000a      environment data from objects, devices and buildings around the world\u000a      through the internet of\u000a      things &#8212; a globally online network of tools and gadgets. Key\u000a      characteristics of the software were\u000a      informed by Gage's work on low-cost local actuated-environmental\u000a      monitoring, human-to-computer\u000a      and open-source enabled design [c, d]. The Director of the firm\u000a      specifically acknowledged the\u000a      influence of this work on the development of Pachube [6]. In 2011\u000a      the software (now rebranded as\u000a      Xively) was sold as a $15m spin-off company to LogMeIn to support its\u000a      cloud services; by July\u000a      2013, more than seven million devices have been connected using Pachube\u000a      technology.\u000a    (iv) Contribution to the global profile of British innovation in\u000a        architecture and design: The\u000a      use of the research by established architectural practices has allowed\u000a      their delivery since 2008 of\u000a      some of the best and most innovative design in the world.

The BIAW focuses on\u000a      interactive technologies\u000a      as subjects of investigation in their own right and their use for creating\u000a      innovative architecture.\u000a      Taking its cues from systems theory, cybernetics, behavioural analysis and\u000a      performative design,\u000a      Gage's research has elucidated a continuous design feedback between\u000a      digital and physical\u000a      iterations. This has informed the work of commercial design studios such\u000a      as Wilkinson Eyre\u000a      (Matthew Potter), Flanagan Lawrence (Paul Bavister), Haque Design and\u000a      Research (Usman\u000a      Haque), Jason Bruges Studios (Jason Bruges, Dave DiDuca, Richard Roberts),\u000a      Sixteen Makers*\u000a      (Chris Leung); and led to collaborations with researchers now at the Arhus\u000a      School of Architecture\u000a      (Phil Ayres was employed until 2001 as a researcher in the BIAW team),\u000a      McLean and Silver\u000a      Westminster (Will McLean and Peter Silver, also previously at the\u000a      Architectural Association), and\u000a      Ruairi Glynn. There are two strands to the research that underpins the\u000a      impacts described here:\u000a    (i) Responsive behaviour, interactivity and performance. BIAW's\u000a      work is predicated on the\u000a      notion of architecture as time-based, thus changing its form and behaviour\u000a      rather than being static\u000a      and fixed. As such, the people and objects in the built environment can be\u000a      regarded as performers,\u000a      especially where the behaviour of those objects is also subject to change\u000a      over time. Against this\u000a      backdrop, BIAW research has explored and demonstrated the importance of\u000a      analysing responsive\u000a      behaviour, particularly in order to understand the differences between\u000a      simulated virtual systems\u000a      and the lived behaviour of occupants whose engagement with their\u000a      environment is largely haptic.\u000a      This is treated as vital to conceptualising the immediate, localised\u000a      responses of dynamic\u000a      architectural elements or systems to their external environment or\u000a      patterns of internal occupation.\u000a    These innovative theoretical ideas were applied in Gage's 2006\u000a      exploration of human observers'\u000a      appreciation of two responsive and interactive installations, `The Wonder\u000a      of Trivial Machines' and\u000a      `Edge Monkeys' [a]. The theme of performance was developed further\u000a      in a 2009 paper by Gage\u000a      exploring notions of the temporary and permanent in interactive design [b].\u000a      The research also\u000a      considers the ways in which constructed environments can `observe' and\u000a      respond to users' needs,\u000a      in turn catalysing performativity contingent on those observed needs and\u000a      responses.\u000a    (ii) Innovative design practice. Understanding differences between\u000a      simulated and actual\u000a      behaviour is especially relevant in design, where the observer's\u000a      engagement is haptic and the\u000a      virtual observer's descriptions are inevitably partial and incomplete.\u000a      Work on interactive\u000a      technologies and innovative design practice is founded particularly on\u000a      research led by Gage\u000a      between 1998 and 2001, funded by the Department of Trade and Industry,\u000a      which examined the\u000a      innovative use of micro-controllers and internal environmental monitoring\u000a      in the design and control\u000a      of `top down' ventilation in urban areas [c]. Gage's second\u000a      approach during this period investigated\u000a      the transitory and experiential possibilities of interactive architecture.\u000a      Conducted in collaboration\u000a      with Pete Silver, this research extended Silver's earlier work with John\u000a      Fraser and Gordon Pask at\u000a      the Architectural Association on cybernetic and performative interests;\u000a      the resulting `aesthetically\u000a      potent environments' (Pask) showed how occupants' delight informs our\u000a      experience of buildings.\u000a    In combination, these ideas put forward by Gage and BIAW colleagues have\u000a      underpinned the\u000a      exploration of the capacity for accessible, low-cost digital equipment for\u000a      sensing, computation and\u000a      actuation to produce beneficial short circuits in the design process [d].\u000a      The research has\u000a      demonstrated that working directly with new responsive technologies allows\u000a      architects and\u000a      designers not only to create projects with time-based features, but also\u000a      to produce innovative\u000a      software with significant marketing potential. Gage's most recent research\u000a      focuses on the\u000a      relationship between active facades and interior occupancy, and the\u000a      possibilities for delivering\u000a      innovative, interactive, indeterminate architecture in the context of\u000a      environmental sustainability.\u000a    Both of the two main research strands came together in papers presented\u000a      at the Digital Creativity\u000a      Conference (2000) which examined human delight in, and recognition of,\u000a      physical and logical\u000a      patterns in designed environments. They have also informed the research\u000a      conducted and\u000a      published by Phil Ayres (2001-2003) [e], and, in the case of Usman\u000a      Haque, supporting the\u000a      production of his spectacular installations Scents of Space (2002)\u000a      and Sky Ear (2005).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36904","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    (i) Contributions to and impacts arising from the transformation of UK\u000a        Public Spaces:\u000a    Projects by SSLtd, underpinned by the UCL research work described above,\u000a      have informed the local plans, strategies and planning application\u000a      processes of important projects for more than ten local authorities in the\u000a      UK. By creating a more robust and evidence-informed planning process, the\u000a      research has made a significant contribution to the success of those\u000a      projects, each of which affects many thousands of local constituents [2].\u000a      It has also supported the efficient and successful delivery of more than\u000a      50 private-led developments in the UK, including Camden Market (with\u000a      Chelsfield Partners and MAKE Architects, then AHMM), and Elizabeth House\u000a      (with Chelsfield Partners and Chelsfield Partners) [3].\u000a    The regenerative and economic impacts of our contributions to the\u000a      redevelopment of UK public spaces are well demonstrated in the case of Old\u000a      Market Square, Nottingham. Work started in 2003 on this &#163;7 million\u000a      Nottingham City Council project to transform a dysfunctional and\u000a      problematic urban space, which is used annually by more than 5 million\u000a      local residents and visitors to the city.\u000a    The redevelopment of this high traffic, politically sensitive, and\u000a      historically listed area drew particularly on UCL research for strategic\u000a      design recommendations, pedestrian movement forecasts and detailed spatial\u000a      analysis. In particular, the project's success relied heavily on the\u000a      ability to deliver static space occupancy, since a space that only\u000a      supported movement would fail to meet the key objectives of increasing\u000a      interpersonal communication and transactions within the Old Market Square.\u000a      The square, which is now the centrepiece of Nottingham's regeneration\u000a      efforts, reopened to the public in 2007. It has since won multiple awards\u000a      recognising it as one of the most successful public spaces in the UK,\u000a      including three Civic Trust awards in 2008 for which it beat a shortlist\u000a      of 100 contenders [4]. The redesign of this previously\u000a      relentlessly underperforming historic area has significantly diversified\u000a      and increased its usage. Thus, for example, it now hosts an annual `German\u000a      Market' in December, and is also transformed during the summer into the\u000a      `Nottingham Riviera', as well as hosting myriad short-term events\u000a      throughout the year. The new design and subsequent diversification of the\u000a      Old Market Square's use has supported increased footfall through the area:\u000a      in the twelve months to the end of April 2012, Nottingham saw a 0.9%\u000a      increase in footfall compared to the rest of the East Midlands, which\u000a      declined by 2.5%, and compared with footfall in UK towns and cities more\u000a      broadly, which declined by an average of 2% during the same period [5].\u000a      These changes helped support local shops and restaurants, a contribution\u000a      that has been particularly important during the recession. The redesigned\u000a      square has also brought significant cultural benefits to Nottingham,\u000a      improving the image of the city and contributing to the preservation of\u000a      national heritage as a lived environment. Writing in June 2008, the\u000a      Business Correspondent of the Nottingham Evening Post summarised\u000a      some of the benefits that the redeveloped Square had brought to the city,\u000a      by saying: `Only the churlish would fail to acknowledge the difference\u000a        that the multi-million investment in the Old Market Square has made to\u000a        the heart of our city. While it may take some time in the current\u000a        circumstances, there is little doubt that this is an investment that\u000a        will, in the long run, pay for itself. It hosts events, it showcases the\u000a        city, it brings in visitors, it is a place where people gather. People\u000a        spend money in Nottingham's city centre economy as a direct result of\u000a        the square's enhanced presence.' [6]\u000a    (ii) Contributions to and impacts arising from urban masterplanning\u000a          in Jeddah:\u000a    Further afield, the space syntax team has achieved significant\u000a      international impacts through research in Jeddah. This began with the 2006\u000a      commissioning of SSLtd by the Jeddah Municipality to provide spatial\u000a      development strategies for the city, the population of which had increased\u000a      from 2 million in 1993 to 3.2 million at the last census in 2010. The\u000a      SSLtd project, Strategic Planning Framework, has made a vital\u000a      contribution to planning and decision-making processes affecting the whole\u000a      city, including the redevelopment of large and highly populous areas of\u000a      unplanned settlement [7]. It also led to a series of further high\u000a      profile projects led by SSLtd, including the development in 2008-09 of the\u000a      masterplan for the City Centre of Jeddah, a 500-hectare area in the heart\u000a      of the city incorporating both its historic core (Al-Balad) and its\u000a      waterfront area. Although the project is yet to be implemented, the SSLtd\u000a      masterplan has already had profound impacts on planning and resource\u000a      allocation in Jeddah.\u000a    Space syntax research into natural movement and the movement economy [a-d],\u000a      when repeated in the quite different cultural and environmental context of\u000a      Saudi Arabia, has shown that the principles not only also apply there, but\u000a      that they can account for the land use and movement patterns even in\u000a      Jeddah's unplanned settlements. This has allowed the development of\u000a      evidence- based policy tools to support the municipality's primary\u000a      socio-economic regeneration objectives, as well as the reintegration of\u000a      the historic city centre into the vastly expanded context [e].\u000a    Since 2008, SSLtd has been working with the Municipality of Jeddah and\u000a      Jeddah Development and Urban Regeneration Company (JDURC) on six projects\u000a      &#8212; with a total consultancy value in excess of &#163;1.5m &#8212; to develop\u000a      regeneration strategies and development plans for more than 50 such areas\u000a      of unplanned settlement with an estimated total population of 1 million.\u000a      These unplanned settlements suffer from multiple urban, social and\u000a      economic problems, and are considered the most challenging areas for\u000a      improvement in Jeddah. Using an analytical, evidence- based approach [e],\u000a      SSLtd has developed prioritisation strategies, spatial designs, financial\u000a      models and adaptable and interchangeable regeneration scenarios ranging\u000a      from minimum intervention to full redevelopment. These plans are being\u000a      used by the communities themselves, as well as by local authorities and\u000a      private sector organisations, to transform Jeddah's unplanned settlements\u000a      and enhance socio-economic conditions therein [7]. They have\u000a      particularly informed the Draft Strategic Plan of Jeddah,\u000a      published for consultation in 2010. This plan was revised in 2013 by AECOM\u000a      (a global provider of professional technical and management support\u000a      services) along with SSLtd on the basis of consultations in Jeddah, and\u000a      will be adopted soon.\u000a    The same projects are also informing a two-year planning mega project\u000a      commissioned in February 2013 to inform the development of Jeddah\u000a      Sub-regional, Structural and Local Plans [7]. Its consultancy fees\u000a      alone exceed &#163;8million, &#163;1.2m of which goes to SSLtd. In collaboration\u000a      with AECOM, SSLtd's contribution to that project includes analytical\u000a      models of the city providing the basis for the precedent studies, baseline\u000a      research, option assessment and option development at all scales of the\u000a      project. The project will produce city plans for the next 20 years,\u000a      affecting millions of current and future residents of Jeddah and\u000a      accounting for the use of billions of Saudi Riyals. Although its full\u000a      implementation will take a long time, the impact of SSLtd research on the\u000a      project is already emerging. The city's department of unplanned settlement\u000a      is currently using the SSLtd plans to issue planning permissions in 25\u000a      unplanned settlements with a total population of over 500,000 [7].\u000a      Following SSLtd recommendations, all categories of unplanned settlements\u000a      have been designated to specific authorities or public-private partnership\u000a      companies for further actions. The JDURC started the physical\u000a      transformation of two of these areas (Al-Ruwais and Khozam) in 2011 and is\u000a      now moving on to work on another six areas. The municipality of Jeddah has\u000a      also started physical interventions based on SSLtd's recommendations in\u000a      another eight central areas, including the highly populated areas of\u000a      Al-Balad, Betrumin and Qulail. These projects will enhance the\u000a      accessibility of the communities to wider economic and social\u000a      opportunities in Jeddah [7].\u000a    Space syntax research has, moreover, already generated more widespread\u000a      international impacts through its development of an evidence-based,\u000a      analytical approach to addressing some of the problems faced by those\u000a      living in unplanned and informal settlements. The significance of this\u000a      methodology is acknowledged by its inclusion in important international\u000a      policy documents including UNICEF's 2012 report on The State of the\u000a        World's Children 2012: Children in an Urban World [8].\u000a    Both of the examples outlined here demonstrate the global reach and\u000a      significance of UCL's world- leading space syntax research, the impacts of\u000a      which include benefits to the UK economy through export, and to the\u000a      quality of life of local populations both at home and abroad. The research\u000a      has also prompted increased public awareness of, and an interest in, the\u000a      issues it considers. It is an interest demonstrated, for example, by its\u000a      inclusion in the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony as one of Danny\u000a      Boyle's many allusions to seminal UK research innovations [9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes impacts arising from pioneering UCL space\u000a      syntax research by Hillier, Penn et al, funded principally by the EPSRC.\u000a      Impacts have been achieved particularly through the establishment and\u000a      subsequent activities of a technology transfer spin-out company, Space\u000a      Syntax Limited (SSLtd), which works closely with UCL researchers to\u000a      provide strategic, evidence-based consulting services in architectural and\u000a      urban design, planning, transport and property development.

It allows the treatment of spatial\u000a      configuration as a variable in the analysis of the socio-economic\u000a      function, cultural significance and behavioural implications of spatial\u000a      design. This includes patterns of movement, awareness and interaction;\u000a      density, land use and land value; urban growth and societal\u000a      differentiation; and safety and crime distribution, whether in\u000a      contemporary or historical contexts. To the degree that analysis of\u000a      spatial configuration can account for observed functional or behavioural\u000a      outcomes, these theories can be used predictively to assess likely\u000a      functional behaviour and early-stage design options, and thus inform\u000a      strategic design.\u000a    The relationship between the Space Group in UCL and SSLtd is intimate.\u000a      Theories and analytical methods developed in the lab are tested against\u000a      data provided by live projects in the company. These live projects give\u000a      rise to questions that challenge theory, regularly testing theory by\u000a      finding anomalies that need to be accounted for. This then drives\u000a      innovation in both theory and method. All the while the applications are\u000a      those that clients are prepared to pay and provide data for since they\u000a      matter to their business, while various UK Research Councils have\u000a      recognised the scientific value that this brings, by giving continuous\u000a      support to space syntax research since the 1980s.\u000a    This case study focuses on those aspects of the research relevant to two\u000a      examples of impact: the design of well used public open space, and\u000a      large-scale urban masterplanning. There are three relevant research\u000a      findings: the theory of natural movement [a, b]; the theory of the\u000a      movement economy [e]; and findings about `static' space use in\u000a      public open space [c, e]. Briefly, space syntax research from the\u000a      mid-1980s to early-90s mainly tried to understand how street layout\u000a      configuration affected pedestrian and vehicular movement. Research\u000a      projects funded by the SERC and EPSRC found that traffic flows in both\u000a      modes consistently correlate with measures of network accessibility. By\u000a      studying homogeneous residential as well as mixed-use\u000a      commercial\/residential areas, it was possible to show the fundamental\u000a      causal effect of the street layout on urban movement; this `foot-fall' in\u000a      turn attracted non-residential land uses, which then attracted further\u000a      pedestrian and vehicular movement in a `multiplier effect' [a].\u000a      Secondly, the theory of the movement economy showed how urban land use\u000a      patterns evolve to achieve a structured mixing of uses in historic and\u000a      unplanned settlements, locating land uses on streets in densities\u000a      appropriate to their accessibility. Finally, detailed studies of public\u000a      open space showed how the movement network gave rise to patterns of static\u000a      space use in urban squares, contributing to vibrant urban life, while\u000a      accounting for the reverse where planners failed to provide the required\u000a      conditions [b].\u000a    Space syntax has for a long time sought to test out its theories against\u000a      practical live applications. In the 1980s it worked pro-bono on projects\u000a      for local tenants groups on public housing estates subject to development\u000a      proposals (e.g. Mozart and Maiden Lane Estates, Coin Street), carrying out\u000a      analysis and observations in order to give voice to tenants concerns at\u000a      public consultations and planning inquiries. In 1986 UCL's space syntax\u000a      team was commissioned by Rosehaugh Stanhope PLC to advise on their\u000a      competition scheme for the Kings Cross Railway Lands, subsequently going\u000a      on to advise on the later phases of the Broadgate development, Paternoster\u000a      Square and Peter Palumbo's Mansion House Square scheme. During the 1990s\u000a      it advised London's South Bank Centre on schemes for the regeneration of\u000a      that area, and on the Millennium Bridge scheme which links St Paul's to\u000a      the Tate Modern, and on the `World Squares for All' scheme to reintegrate\u000a      the heart of Trafalgar Square into the urban life of London's West End.\u000a      According to the Department of Transport, the immediate effects of the\u000a      Trafalgar Square redevelopment, completed in 2003, were profound.\u000a      Improvements included a 250% increase in pedestrian activity; a 900%\u000a      increase in its use as a pedestrian through-route; and transformed public\u000a      perceptions of Trafalgar Square as a destination. In total, an estimated\u000a      8,000 user installations of space syntax software have been made worldwide\u000a      to date, with a sharp rise after the code was open-sourced. All these\u000a      factors serve as the research background for the various impacts within\u000a      the REF period outlined below.\u000a    The space syntax research was led by Professor Bill Hillier (Senior\u000a      Lecturer, Reader, then Professor; at UCL since 1974); Professor Alan Penn\u000a      (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader then Professor; at UCL since 1989); and\u000a      Kayvan Karimi (Senior Lecturer; joined UCL in 2009).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36931","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Street lighting is a massive infrastructural undertaking that uses a lot\u000d\u000a      of energy. In the UK in 2005, there were 8.12 million lighting points on\u000d\u000a      the country's streets using approximately 3.14 TWH of electricity, which\u000d\u000a      gave rise to CO2 emissions of 1.32 megatons [1]. Of\u000d\u000a      these 8.12 million lighting points, 6.31 million of them were street\u000d\u000a      lights while the rest comprised sign illuminations or lit bollards &#8212;\u000d\u000a      furthermore, by 2012 the number of street lights in the UK had increased\u000d\u000a      to about 6.9 million in total [2]. Whilst of course street\u000d\u000a      lighting is only one of many users of energy, it is a highly visible case,\u000d\u000a      and with the rise in environmental concerns so many pressures began to\u000d\u000a      grow on local authorities to reduce the level of public lighting so as to\u000d\u000a      save energy. However, on the other hand, a higher amount of street\u000d\u000a      lighting provides many important benefits related to crime prevention and\u000d\u000a      public safety. This is where the innovative Bartlett research work by\u000d\u000a      Raynham et al proved to be so useful. By showing that white lights with\u000d\u000a      lower illuminance had the same benefits as brighter sodium lights, the\u000d\u000a      research thereby provided an opportunity to maintain the clear social and\u000d\u000a      public safety benefits of high amounts of street lighting &#8212; for\u000d\u000a      pedestrians and motorists alike &#8212; but with a concomitant reduction in\u000d\u000a      energy use by as much as 30-40% and with a resultant drop in greenhouse\u000d\u000a      gas emissions estimated at 45.5 megatons in the UK in 2012.\u000d\u000a    Change in British Standards on street lighting:\u000d\u000a    In 2003, the British Standard (BS) for street lighting, Code of\u000d\u000a        practice for the design of road lighting &#8212; Part 1: Lighting of roads and\u000d\u000a        public amenity areas (BS 5489-1: 2003), was published [3].\u000d\u000a      Drawing directly on research findings [a] that had been published\u000d\u000a      in The Lighting Journal to coincide with the deliberations leading\u000d\u000a      up to the revision of the code, the reissued standards gave revised\u000d\u000a      guidance on the selection of lighting classes for subsidiary roads.\u000d\u000a    In particular, it permitted the selection of a lower lighting class, as\u000d\u000a      defined in BS EN 13201-2 [4], which in turn permitted these\u000d\u000a      subsidiary roads to be lit with white lights which used a lower\u000d\u000a      illuminance class than those lit with the traditional orange sodium lamps.\u000d\u000a      This meant that energy usage lighting levels could be reduced by at least\u000d\u000a      30-40%. It should be pointed out that the Bartlett's research\u000d\u000a      investigations outlined in Section 2 suggest that the energy needed to\u000d\u000a      achieve the same lighting levels using white light can in fact drop by as\u000d\u000a      much 50%; however, British Standard committees are notoriously (and\u000d\u000a      rightly) cautious, hence the use of a slightly lower energy reduction\u000d\u000a      figure in this case study. Nonetheless, as a result of this change in the\u000d\u000a      codes, stimulated by the work of Raynham et al, there has since been an\u000d\u000a      accelerating move towards white lights for street lighting. This is also\u000d\u000a      partly attributable to the fact that since 2005 most of the major\u000d\u000a      renovations of street lighting in the UK have been carried out using\u000d\u000a      private finance initiative (PFI) schemes, with those in charge of those\u000d\u000a      being keen to make savings. All of the PFI schemes started since 2006 that\u000d\u000a      the Bartlett researchers were able to check use white light for\u000d\u000a      residential roads, and this can be seen for example in Hampshire,\u000d\u000a      Northamptonshire, Croydon and the London Borough of Lewisham [5].\u000d\u000a    Increasing the uptake of white light:\u000d\u000a    In the first few years, the uptake of white lights for street lighting\u000d\u000a      was slow, but improvements in lamp technology soon led to the emergence of\u000d\u000a      a range of white metal halide lamps that could take advantage of the\u000d\u000a      changed British Standard codes. Already by 2007 &#8212; and definitely since\u000d\u000a      then and during the entire REF 2014 impact census period &#8212; the situation\u000d\u000a      in the UK developed to the point where virtually all new installations of\u000d\u000a      street lighting installations were using white light.\u000d\u000a    Totally accurate data on the UK's population of street lights is very\u000d\u000a      hard to come by as the lights themselves are run by a number of different\u000d\u000a      authorities, and whilst there has been significant improvement in recent\u000d\u000a      years many of the inventories made of them, the figures are still not\u000d\u000a      entirely reliable. The following analysis is thus based on a chart\u000d\u000a      covering road lighting that was provided by Philips Lighting [2],\u000d\u000a      from which data was extracted data and then confirmed in terms of general\u000d\u000a      accuracy with that company. In many ways it is the most reliable source\u000d\u000a      available, given that Philips is by far the largest vendor of street\u000d\u000a      lighting lanterns in the UK. They supply both luminaires and lamps, and\u000d\u000a      therefore have the greatest need to determine accurate data about light\u000d\u000a      sources so that they can assess the size of the lamp replacement market.\u000d\u000a      From this Philips data, it becomes possible to plot the rise of white\u000d\u000a      light sources used in street lighting from 2005, when virtually none of\u000d\u000a      them were being used, through to 2012, where they have become increasingly\u000d\u000a      popular.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aNumber of street lanterns in the UK [Philips Lighting, Source 2]\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    Thus the chart indicates, the use of white light has risen dramatically\u000d\u000a      during the REF impact period, and in addition it is necessary to note that\u000d\u000a      white LEDs have also been used for street lighting since 2009. At the same\u000d\u000a      time, the number of lamps based on older technologies which emit orange\u000d\u000a      light (high-pressure sodium (SON) and low-pressure sodium (SOX)) has\u000d\u000a      reduced gradually, as the Philips chart also reveals.\u000d\u000a    The most dramatic increase began, in fact, right at the start of the REF\u000d\u000a      impact period. In 2008, the number of white light sources increased by\u000d\u000a      c.260,000 units over the previous year. Since then, the use of white\u000d\u000a      conventional lamps and white LED lighting has grown from 450,000 lighting\u000d\u000a      units in 2008 to about 1,450,000 units in 2012, representing what is\u000d\u000a      nearly a threefold increase.\u000d\u000a    Energy savings and emissions reduction due to white light:\u000d\u000a    As mentioned, this increase in the use of white lighting has had\u000d\u000a      significant knock-on effects for the UK's energy usage and the reduction\u000d\u000a      of carbon emissions. The orange-coloured 70W SON (high-pressure sodium\u000d\u000a      lamp), which was for a long time the typical light source for street\u000d\u000a      lighting, has a total circuit power of 79W, allowing for aspects such as\u000d\u000a      gear losses [5]. This is in good correlation with the 2005 data\u000d\u000a      which suggested an average power usage for all street lighting points of\u000d\u000a      76.26 W, but also included relatively low powered illuminated signs and\u000d\u000a      bollards [1].\u000d\u000a    The most conservative estimate of the energy saved by the use of white\u000d\u000a      light assumes that the current population of c.1,200,000 conventional\u000d\u000a      white light lanterns has replaced the old 70W SON lanterns with an average\u000d\u000a      energy saving of 30% on each lamp. This gives a safe figure for a\u000d\u000a      reduction of 28.4 MW in the energy load of these streetlights. Assuming\u000d\u000a      that each lantern is on for 4,000 hours per year, then the changeover to\u000d\u000a      white light can be calculated to have saved the UK 113 GWh of electricity\u000d\u000a      in 2012. This reduction also saved local authorities in the UK over &#163;10\u000d\u000a      million in electricity costs that year, and also reduced payments\u000d\u000a      associated with their carbon reduction commitments. Taking again a\u000d\u000a      conservative estimate of 0.4 kg of CO2 emissions per KWh of\u000d\u000a      electricity at night [6], this represents a total saving of 45.5\u000d\u000a      megatons of CO2 in 2012.\u000d\u000a    Hence the Bartlett research of Raynham et al has proved to be a major\u000d\u000a      contributor towards helping the UK meet the EU's set target of reducing\u000d\u000a      emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. Using UK government\u000d\u000a      figures, it is estimated that the UK's net emissions in 2012 were 479.1\u000d\u000a      megatons of CO2 equivalent &#8212; thus it can be seen that over 9\u000d\u000a      per cent savings in emissions were achieved through the changeover to\u000d\u000a      white lights for street lighting [7].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Raynham et al has led to the adoption of white light in\u000d\u000a      residential roads and city centres throughout the UK, enabling an energy\u000d\u000a      saving of 30-40% while providing better quality of street lighting. As a\u000d\u000a      result, today there are now c.1,200,000 conventional street lights with\u000d\u000a      white light sources and a further c.220,000 LED lanterns that emit white\u000d\u000a      light. Conservative estimates suggest that this changeover to white light\u000d\u000a      saved 113 GWh of electricity in 2012, and thus reduced the UK emissions of\u000d\u000a      CO2 by 45.5 megatons.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University College London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[a] Raynham, P. &amp; Saksvikr&#248;nning, T.

Raynham's work has been undertaken as part of the Light and\u000d\u000a      Lighting research group in the Bartlett School of Graduate Studies.\u000d\u000a    In terms of the theme of the underpinning research, it had been noted\u000d\u000a      anecdotally that white light appeared to be better for street lighting\u000d\u000a      than the traditionally used yellow or orange lighting, but there was no\u000d\u000a      hard evidence. To test this idea, in 2002 researchers at the UCL Bartlett\u000d\u000a      Faculty of the Built Environment drew upon the pioneering work of Caminada\u000d\u000a      and van Bommel in the early 1980s, who identified facial recognition as\u000d\u000a      important to pedestrians on the streets at night and proposed that the\u000d\u000a      ability to recognise other people at a distance of at least four metres\u000d\u000a      indicated an adequate level of street lighting.\u000d\u000a    The Bartlett's research team used the same basic methodology as Caminada\u000d\u000a      and van Bommel, asking subjects to walk towards another person until they\u000d\u000a      could just recognise the face of that other person. At this point they\u000d\u000a      were asked to stop and the distance was measured. However, in order that\u000d\u000a      the research investigation could be more spatially controlled, and also\u000d\u000a      permit rapid changes in light sources, the Bartlett study used a dummy\u000d\u000a      street that was set up in a disused office building. Due to good relations\u000d\u000a      with the UK's two leading lighting societies, it was possible to appeal\u000d\u000a      for volunteers from all their members, resulting in a large number of test\u000d\u000a      subjects with ages ranging from 16 to 70 years old. A range of light\u000d\u000a      sources were tested, including high-pressure sodium bulbs and two types of\u000d\u000a      compact fluorescent light sources. Each of the light sources was tested at\u000d\u000a      least at two levels of illumination, as previously done by Caminada and\u000d\u000a      van Bommel. For the white light fluorescent sources, very similar results\u000d\u000a      were obtained to those reported previously by Caminada and van Bommel.\u000d\u000a      However, through the Bartlett's research the real discovery was that, with\u000d\u000a      high-pressure sodium bulbs, it was necessary to use significantly higher\u000d\u000a      illuminances, with much higher energy use, to obtain the same recognition\u000d\u000a      distance.\u000d\u000a    The Bartlett's research was first published in 2003 in The Lighting\u000d\u000a        Journal [a], a non-peer review journal which nonetheless has\u000d\u000a      a very wide circulation among public lighting engineers. This was done\u000d\u000a      deliberately to ensure that the research findings would be in the public\u000d\u000a      domain ahead of a review of the British Standard on road lighting, which\u000d\u000a      was just then about to be republished. The findings also formed part of an\u000d\u000a      invited talk given by Raynham to the Society of Light and Lighting in\u000d\u000a      2003, published subsequently in a journal essay tiled `An examination of\u000d\u000a      the fundamentals of road lighting for pedestrians and drivers' [b].\u000d\u000a      Raynham's paper challenged the fundamental principles of street lighting\u000d\u000a      on main roads and suggested use of task performance in a similar manner to\u000d\u000a      that used for pedestrian lighting. The findings of this research project,\u000d\u000a      coupled with other parts of the Urban Lights project, were also reported\u000d\u000a      in at a number of conferences and perhaps the best overall review of the\u000d\u000a      work was given at Lux Europa in 2005 [c].\u000d\u000a    The results of this research project at the UCL Bartlett, coupled with\u000d\u000a      the continuing downward pressure on energy use in the UK, and the desire\u000d\u000a      to reduce carbon emissions, has kick-started a much closer examination of\u000d\u000a      the needs of pedestrians on streets at night, and work on that particular\u000d\u000a      subject is now being undertaken by Raynham et all in the EPSRC-funded\u000d\u000a      MERLIN project (EP\/I003584\/1). Its initial findings about the way in which\u000d\u000a      pedestrians changed how they looked at the street scenes in which they\u000d\u000a      walked around at night, as they became more concerned about the\u000d\u000a      environmental consequences of high energy usage, were published in 2012 [d].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36988","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    It is difficult to overstate the importance of having a sophisticated and\u000d\u000a      transparent set of state-of-the-art energy systems models for proactive\u000d\u000a      and responsive engagement with the UK policy community. Models are the\u000d\u000a      integrating language of policy and provide the key numbers and insights\u000d\u000a      that form the backbone of the debate and resultant policy impacts. This is\u000d\u000a      particularly true in the highly topical and fast moving area of energy\u000d\u000a      policy, and especially the key goals of energy system decarbonisation and\u000d\u000a      energy security.\u000d\u000a    The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), in its 2009 UK\u000d\u000a        Low Carbon Transition Plan [1], accepted the MARKAL elastic\u000d\u000a      demand model's finding (as described in [d]) of the critical role\u000d\u000a      of the electricity generation sector to enable wider decarbonisation\u000d\u000a      efforts in buildings and transport. Resultant electricity decarbonisation\u000d\u000a      policy mechanisms have been implemented as a key government priority with\u000d\u000a      latest efforts being support mechanisms under Electricity Market Reform as\u000d\u000a      legislated in the 2013 Energy Bill.\u000d\u000a    A continuing impact of the MARKAL-TIMES modelling effort for UK\u000d\u000a      government policy making has been in demonstrating the economic\u000d\u000a      feasibility of decarbonisation pathways (as described in [a]),\u000d\u000a      including the critical interplay between technological and behavioural\u000d\u000a      change (via energy service demand reductions). UK MARKAL-TIMES has\u000d\u000a      constituted the key technical reports on this topic for DECC's 2011 Carbon\u000d\u000a      Plan [2].\u000d\u000a    The quantification of electricity sector decarbonisation using MARKAL\u000d\u000a      models is an essential enabling step to meet the targets set by the\u000d\u000a      Committee on Climate Change (CCC). The CCC's carbon budget reports\u000d\u000a      (2009-13) outline the framework for legislated UK carbon budgets, with\u000d\u000a      successively commissioned MARKAL-TIMES modelling projects providing\u000d\u000a      long-term energy and emission scenarios. In 2011, the UK government\u000d\u000a      accepted the CCC's 4th budget period recommendation [3] for a 50%\u000d\u000a      reduction (from 1990 levels) in carbon emissions by 2025, with\u000d\u000a      underpinning technical appendices from the UK stochastic MARKAL model [c].\u000d\u000a    Dr David Joffe, the Head of Modelling for the Committee on Climate\u000d\u000a      Change, has since stated: `Since 2009, UCL's family of MARKAL\/TIMES\u000d\u000a        energy systems models have been heavily utilised by the CCC to explore\u000d\u000a        the costs and trade-offs between different long-term decarbonisation\u000d\u000a        pathways. This underpinning research &#8212; published in successive CCC\u000d\u000a        reports &#8212; has been invaluable in the CCC's assessment of the appropriate\u000d\u000a        level of the 2050 target, what this means for measures required in the\u000d\u000a        medium term within the UK's carbon budget periods, and the policy\u000d\u000a        framework to deliver these.'\u000d\u000a    Placing UK decarbonisation efforts in a global context [b], the\u000d\u000a      TIAM-UCL model provided the key underpinning technical appendix to the\u000d\u000a      CCC's 2010 international aviation and shipping review [4], which\u000d\u000a      advocated including international transport emissions in the UK's\u000d\u000a      legislated carbon budgets for a fully comprehensive mitigation response to\u000d\u000a      climate change.\u000d\u000a    Such has been the authoritative benchmark of MARKAL-TIMES that UCL has\u000d\u000a      been instrumental in developing complementary energy modelling tools for\u000d\u000a      key stakeholders. This has included Strachan serving as a strategic\u000d\u000a      advisor on the development of the ESME energy systems model of the Energy\u000d\u000a      Technologies Institute from 2010, illustrating how UK industry has adopted\u000d\u000a      an energy systems modelling approach. In a parallel development, Ekins and\u000d\u000a      Strachan have successfully argued for the incorporation of cost metrics\u000d\u000a      (derived explicitly from MARKAL) to be incorporated into the DECC\u000d\u000a      Calculator [5] &#8212; the UK government's highly popular policy\u000d\u000a      engagement tool, which is downloaded by 10,000 UK users each month and has\u000d\u000a      been adapted into the nationally utilised My2050 schools classroom toolkit\u000d\u000a      released in November 2012.\u000d\u000a    Research has been used to provide evidence to policy makers and thus\u000d\u000a      contribute to informed political debate. On 24 May 2011, Strachan was\u000d\u000a      invited to give parliamentary oral evidence based on his modelling\u000d\u000a      expertise to The UK's Energy Supply: Security or Independence\u000d\u000a      review by the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee.\u000d\u000a      Following the publication of his review of modelling exercises using the\u000d\u000a      UCL MARKAL model from 2009-2013 [6], all of which were directly\u000d\u000a      used in policy support as discussed above, Ekins made two presentations in\u000d\u000a      the Houses of Parliament. At the House of Commons on 26 February 2013,\u000d\u000a      Ekins presented a paper at a UKERC policy briefing on `The UK Energy\u000d\u000a      System in 2050: Comparing Low-Carbon, Resilient Scenarios' to a number of\u000d\u000a      MPs and their researchers, which fed directly into the then current debate\u000d\u000a      on the Energy Bill about the need to decarbonise the UK electricity\u000d\u000a      system. On 1 May 2013, Ekins then presented in the House of Lords on `The\u000d\u000a      Role of Gas in a Low-Carbon UK Energy System: Insights from Modelling',\u000d\u000a      which has informed the current debate about the role of shale gas from\u000d\u000a      2020 in the UK energy system.\u000d\u000a    In terms of sub-national energy policy-making, a multi-regional version\u000d\u000a      of the UK MARKAL model was presented to senior Scottish government and\u000d\u000a      industry representatives on the potential role of Scotland in meeting its\u000d\u000a      own and the wider UK's renewable energy targets, and subsequently\u000d\u000a      submitted as supporting evidence to the Scottish Parliament's Economy\u000d\u000a      Energy and Tourism Committee [7].\u000d\u000a    The reach of the MARKAL-TIMES research impact extends also to\u000d\u000a      international energy policy. As research lead on the Japan-UK research\u000d\u000a      project on international modelling on low carbon societies, UCL led an\u000d\u000a      international effort that contributed to the declaration and reaffirmation\u000d\u000a      through 2009-13 of a global long term target of a 50% reduction in\u000d\u000a      greenhouse gas emission in 2050.

As a multi-year\u000d\u000a      multi-person endeavour, the development, maintenance and analysis of the\u000d\u000a      MARKAL-TIMES model has been enabled via dedicated energy systems modelling\u000d\u000a      funding of around &#163;3 million from 2009 through to 2013. This has been\u000d\u000a      anchored by the UK Energy Research Centre (NE\\G007748\\1), of which the\u000d\u000a      Energy Systems theme has been led by Professor Paul Ekins since 2009, with\u000d\u000a      additional sources of income from UK Research Council projects, government\u000d\u000a      departments such as the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change (DECC),\u000d\u000a      statutory governmental bodies (Committee on Climate Change), regulators\u000d\u000a      (Ofgem), energy utilities (EON, EDF), European Commission (FP7) and NGO\u000d\u000a      funding.\u000d\u000a    The MARKAL-TIMES model family is an integrated energy system,\u000d\u000a      technology-rich optimisation framework. Some elements of this research\u000d\u000a      programme &#8212; notably the model code and software interfaces &#8212; came from an\u000d\u000a      international collaboration with a range of premier research institutes\u000d\u000a      via an implementing agreement of the International Energy Agency (IEA).\u000d\u000a      From 2005, Ekins and Strachan had led elsewhere the multi-institution\u000d\u000a      development of the UK MARKAL model. Since both moving to UCL in 2009, the\u000d\u000a      critical mass within the UCL Energy Institute enabled a step-change in the\u000d\u000a      scope and sophistication of successive model variants, including the\u000d\u000a      evolution from the MARKAL to the TIMES model platform, plus the\u000d\u000a      development of UK, EU and global model versions. Furthermore, UCL's\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary modelling capacity allowed a range of interdisciplinary\u000d\u000a      models to be developed to provide a rich diversity of insights. These\u000d\u000a      insights included the interactions between technological and behavioural\u000d\u000a      change (MARKAL Elastic Demand), geographical drivers (MARKAL-GIS),\u000d\u000a      multi-regional impact (MARKAL England-Scotland), decision making under\u000d\u000a      uncertainty (Stochastic MARKAL), life-cycle analysis (TIMES-LCA), and\u000d\u000a      interactions with global drivers (ETM-UCL, TIAM-UCL).\u000d\u000a    This ground-breaking research programme has taken the UK's energy systems\u000d\u000a      analytical capacity to a world-class level.

The first of these is the uptake of his research by\u000a      policy makers; the second is\u000a      Hall's own direct influence on decision making as a policy advisor; and\u000a      the third is his involvement\u000a      in overseeing infrastructure investments in his role as a project\u000a      director. Through these routes, his\u000a      research has had significant impacts on UK infrastructure, providing\u000a      millions of passengers with\u000a      improved transport infrastructure, particularly in once poorly connected\u000a      areas. These three\u000a      pathways to impact &#8212; and illustrative examples of the changes and benefits\u000a      accruing from them and\u000a      resulting from cumulative work over many decades &#8212; can be outlined under\u000a      the following three\u000a      headings:\u000a    (i) Making the case for high speed rail and rail connectivity in the\u000a        UK and Europe\u000a      During the period from 1993-96, Hall worked intensively on the strategic\u000a      design of the Channel\u000a      Tunnel Rail Link (High Speed One). From 1993-94 he was Special Adviser to\u000a      the Secretary of\u000a      State for Environment on Strategic Land Use Planning, with special\u000a      reference to the East Thames\u000a      Corridor and Channel Tunnel Rail Link. In 1994-95 he as drew on his own\u000a      research work in his\u000a      role as adviser to the London and Continental Railways Consortium on\u000a      planning and regeneration\u000a      aspects of the Channel Tunnel High-Speed Rail Link, widely known as High\u000a      Speed One (HS1) &#8212; not\u000a      least in their successful 1995 bid to build and operate the HS1 system. In\u000a      these roles he developed\u000a      the strategy for the Thames Gateway sub-region with the proposed HS1 as\u000a      its centrepiece. At this\u000a      point, although substantially complete in its core area, the London\u000a      Docklands regeneration was still\u000a      lacking development at its eastern end, and there was seen to be a\u000a      strategic need to extend the\u000a      initiative into the wider Lower Thames sub-region. Fundamental research by\u000a      Hall [a, b] informed\u000a      the configuration of the route, particularly the inclusion of station hubs\u000a      on HS1 at Stratford (East\u000a      London) and Ebbsfleet (Kent) [1; p. 142]. Following Hall's\u000a      research findings, Stratford and\u000a      Ebbsfleet were identified as strategically significant potential growth\u000a      poles to trigger economic\u000a      regeneration in the Thames Gateway region, offering attractive connections\u000a      to Central London,\u000a      Southeast England and Northern Europe [1; p. 143]. HS1 opened on\u000a      14 November 2007, and\u000a      Stratford International Station came into use for domestic services on 30\u000a      November 2009.\u000a    Further research by Hall on polycentricity, in particular the concept of\u000a      the Mega-City Region, made\u000a      a vital contribution to the case made for High Speed Two (HS2), a high\u000a      capacity railway linking the\u000a      North of England to London and beyond, connecting directly to the\u000a      continent (via HS1 and the\u000a      Channel Tunnel) and to Heathrow Airport. In 2005, Hall advocated HS2 in an\u000a      article [e] and as a\u000a      member of the Advisory Group to Greengauge 21, a non-profit advocacy group\u000a      working with\u000a      railway industry leaders to whose successful advocacy of the concept he\u000a      made a key contribution.\u000a      Greengauge 21 published its Manifesto in January 2006, attracting\u000a      widespread media coverage\u000a      and stimulating major national debate. In January 2009 the Department of\u000a      Transport accepted the\u000a      case in a report proposing an initial route from London to the West\u000a      Midlands [4], and established\u000a      HS2 Ltd to examine the case and present a potential route. In March 2010\u000a      the Labour government\u000a      accepted the case made in a White Paper on HS2. After further review by\u000a      the incoming Coalition\u000a      Government, in January 2012, following a public consultation on the London\u000a      to West Midlands\u000a      route to which around 55,000 responses were received, the then-Secretary\u000a      of State for Transport\u000a      announced the government's decision to proceed with the construction of\u000a      that line. As a\u000a      consequence, HS2 Phase 1 from London to the West Midlands is currently\u000a      planned to come into\u000a      operation by 2026. The proposal remains controversial, but Hall's research\u000a      has continued to\u000a      provide an important source of evidence in this debate, notably through\u000a      recent research [g] with\u000a      Chia-Lin Chen reporting the positive economic impacts of high speed rail\u000a      on the Lille M&#233;tropole\u000a      sub-region [5].\u000a    (ii) Investment in and benefits of improved UK and European rail\u000a        networks.\u000a      The Green-Hall report [6] and SINTROPHER\/SYNAPTIC research\u000a      projects, both overseen by Hall,\u000a      have led to major investments in UK and European rail service including,\u000a      for example, the upgrade\u000a      of Manchester Victoria Station; the new Koksijde Station (passenger data);\u000a      ongoing investment in\u000a      the redevelopment of stations at Veurne and Diksmuide; and the completion\u000a      of Phase 3 (Line 2) of\u000a      the Valenciennes tramway. Investments made as an integral part of\u000a      SINTROPHER included\u000a      upgrading the Blackpool tramway upgrade investment; this has allowed the\u000a      service to carry more\u000a      than 5m passengers since reopening in April 2012, 15% over the projected\u000a      figure. Furthermore,\u000a      the Blackpool tramway extension (North Pier-North Station) has been\u000a      identified as a regional\u000a      priority for investment in 2015-17 [7].\u000a    Furthermore, the existence of HS1 and Stratford International Station,\u000a      albeit then still under\u000a      construction, was a principal consideration in the International Olympic\u000a      Committee's choice of\u000a      London &#8212; announced in July 2005 &#8212; as the location for the 2012 Olympic\u000a      Games [8]. A total of 4m\u000a      passengers were carried on special shuttle services on HS1 during the\u000a      London Olympics [2] with\u000a      no operational glitches, and a strong post-Olympic boost saw traffic\u000a      through the station up by 5% in\u000a      October &#8212; December 2012 [8].\u000a    Even against a difficult economic backdrop, Eurostar's passenger numbers\u000a      rose by 2% in 2012 to\u000a      9.9 million, up from 9.7 million in 2011. The company's operating profit\u000a      was &#163;52.3 million, a\u000a      substantial increase from &#163;25 million in 2011 [3] &#8212; thereby\u000a      demonstrating both the positive\u000a      economic impacts and the popularity of the service as designed for\u000a      passengers.\u000a    (iii) Orbital Rail and Polycentric Development in London and the\u000a        Greater South East\u000a      Research by Hall back in 1989 [a], and work he conducted in 1999\u000a      for the London Development\u000a      Partnership [d], had a major effect on arguments for London to\u000a      develop in a polycentric manner,\u000a      particularly through successive versions of the Mayor's Strategic Plan in\u000a      2004 and 2009 [9]. The\u000a      1999 report argued for early completion of Orbirail, linking separate rail\u000a      lines in London, into a\u000a      single outer circle system, to encourage a more polycentric form of\u000a      development at key\u000a      interchange hubs. These proposals were the revived by Boris Johnson after\u000a      his election as London\u000a      Mayor in 2008 [9], which led to the completion of Orbirail,\u000a      assisted by a takeover of key national\u000a      rail services in London by Transport for London (notably the North London\u000a      Line) to become the\u000a      London Overground service.\u000a    The full Orbirail system opened in December 2012 [10]. By\u000a      completing the final section of track\u000a      between Surrey Quays and Clapham Junction, previously unconnected areas\u000a      are now served by\u000a      an integrated rail service with trains running directly from Highbury and\u000a      Islington to Clapham\u000a      Junction. In 2012, London Overground carried 120 million passengers,\u000a      nearly four times the\u000a      number carried when it launched in 2007. Including the Orbirail\u000a      extensions, demand has increased\u000a      280%, quadrupling from 2.57 million to 9.83 million journeys per\u000a      four-weekly period. According to\u000a      Boris Johnson as Mayor of London, the passenger numbers on London\u000a      Overground services have\u000a      been `going through the roof' and as a result it has become `the\u000a        most popular suburban railway in\u000a        the country' [11].\u000a    Accordingly, in February 2013, Transport for London (TfL) announced a\u000a      &#163;320-million programme to\u000a      increase capacity by 25%, and to introduce five-car trains on all London\u000a      Overground routes to\u000a      meet rapidly increasing demand for the network's services. In the Public\u000a      Expenditure Review in\u000a      June 2013 the Chancellor of the Exchequer further announced &#163;115 million\u000a      funding for\u000a      electrification of the Gospel Oak-Barking line, potentially extending\u000a      Orbirail to serve major urban\u000a      regeneration in Barking Riverside &#8212; a key site in Hall's Thames Gateway\u000a      proposals [12].\u000a    Outside London, Hall's vision for polycentric development of the Greater\u000a      South East region [c, g]\u000a      also had a demonstrable impact on the Government's 2003 Sustainable\u000a        Communities strategy,\u000a      which follows the model of three major development corridors leading from\u000a      London, and on the\u000a      2005 Milton Keynes-South Midlands Sub-Regional Plan, which proposes\u000a      similar polycentric\u000a      development for the so-called `City of Mercia' (albeit grouped into larger\u000a      urban units). Specifically,\u000a      Hall's vision for an outer orbital rail service were taken up in Surrey\u000a      County Council's proposal in\u000a      March 2013 for an extended service on the lines he had proposed [13].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Hall on transport planning and polycentric development has\u000a      influenced spatial\u000a      planning policies in the UK, USA and China.

At the same time, he also began to develop the\u000a      concept of growth corridors in\u000a      extended mega-city regions [a, c] and developed the \"Regional\u000a      Metro\" concept, especially as a\u000a      basis for growth in South East England. In a report for the Royal Town\u000a      Planning Institute (RTPI) in\u000a      1999 [d], Hall developed the concept of a polycentric London,\u000a      based on the completion of an\u000a      Orbirail system through the capital's middle ring of suburbs. It was a\u000a      forward-looking strategy for\u000a      transport development that was to have a major impact on London's\u000a      transport strategy.\u000a    Subsequent research on living and working patterns in the South East was\u000a      conducted by Hall in his\u000a      role as PI of the EU-funded, eight-nation POLYNET project. From 2003, he\u000a      developed the case for\u000a      improved transport connectivity both between and, increasingly, within\u000a      regions, leading to regional\u000a      and local transport investment in north-west Europe. The POLYNET project\u000a      showed that planning\u000a      strategy should be based on a distinction between `Regional Metro'\u000a      high-speed services and `Very\u000a      High-Speed' services. By bypassing development corridors to connect\u000a      directly to regional core\u000a      cities in the midlands and north of England, this would free space on the\u000a      existing lines to\u000a      accommodate traffic growth without congestion. Hall sketched an outline\u000a      for a future High Speed\u000a      Two network using the old trackbed of the Great Central Railway [e],\u000a      and proposed an outer orbital\u000a      railway connecting places in a 40-to 50-mile ring around London [f].\u000a    From 2008-12 Hall was director of the European Union's SINTROPHER\u000a      project, a &#8364;23 million\u000a      combined research and investment programme to improve connectivity from\u000a      key hubs on the\u000a      emerging European high-speed rail network to five `peripheral' regions in\u000a      north-west Europe. This\u000a      was followed in 2012-13 by the SYNAPTIC programme to promote seamless web\u000a      interchange at\u000a      key hubs. A comparative case study of two regions &#8212; Manchester and its\u000a      sub-regions in north-west\u000a      England, and Lille and its sub-regions in Nord-Pas-de-Calais (France) &#8212;\u000a      showed that, for both\u000a      regions, the arrival of high-speed trains did support the development of a\u000a      knowledge economy.\u000a      Notably, the study showed that whilst faster train connections with the\u000a      national capital provided\u000a      economic benefit to the regional capital the same was not true of some\u000a      sub-regions around it,\u000a      especially those which were formerly industrial [g].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37724","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Findings and tools developed through the UCL research outlined have since\u000d\u000a      been used for various\u000d\u000a      purposes: to effect changes in local and national planning policy; to\u000d\u000a      improve practitioner\u000d\u000a      understand the benefits of integrated planning approaches; to promote a\u000d\u000a      more integrated and\u000d\u000a      efficient investment approach among public bodies; and ultimately to\u000d\u000a      deliver more sustainable\u000d\u000a      outcomes and enhanced community engagement in local authorities across\u000d\u000a      England.\u000d\u000a    The adoption by local and national UK policy-makers of these findings was\u000d\u000a      catalysed by their\u000d\u000a      widespread communication through a series of events starting in 2007 led\u000d\u000a      by the Bartlett School of\u000d\u000a      Planning.

Through these events, a\u000d\u000a      Community of Practice was\u000d\u000a      established in 2008 which now has over 600 members in the UK and abroad to\u000d\u000a      share information,\u000d\u000a      queries and good practice, and also to operate as a support for cultural\u000d\u000a      and professional change.\u000d\u000a    The research also provided the basis for the development by UCL\u000d\u000a      researchers of Morphet's 2008\u000d\u000a      practitioner guide, A steps approach to infrastructure planning and\u000d\u000a        delivery, published by the\u000d\u000a      Planning Advisory Service (PAS) for local strategic partnerships and local\u000d\u000a      authorities on\u000d\u000a      infrastructure delivery planning to act as a guide in adopting the key\u000d\u000a      research recommendations\u000d\u000a      [1]. It is now widely used and frequently quoted by local\u000d\u000a      authorities to support their methodological\u000d\u000a      approach to infrastructure planning as part of their local plan, together\u000d\u000a      with other widely\u000d\u000a      disseminated and used practitioner guidance. The `steps' methodology has\u000d\u000a      since been cited as\u000d\u000a      good practice by PINS [2], and is referenced frequently by local\u000d\u000a      authorities. The RICS has likewise\u000d\u000a      commissioned a specific guide about IDPs for their membership. First\u000d\u000a      issued in 2009, the guide\u000d\u000a      has been updated by an accompanying article in the same subject by Morphet\u000d\u000a      in 2012 [10]. The\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Hub section of the LGA's Knowledge Hub website also\u000d\u000a      hosts practitioner resources\u000d\u000a      based on Morphet's work, and she has produced an invited blog on the\u000d\u000a      integrated role of\u000d\u000a      infrastructure delivery planning at the local, sub-regional and national\u000d\u000a      levels for the RTPI [11].\u000d\u000a    (iii) Adoption of a more integrated investment approach by public\u000d\u000a        bodies: Prior to the UCL\u000d\u000a      research, local authorities were not working across boundaries for\u000d\u000a      infrastructure planning and\u000d\u000a      provision, and hence infrastructure providers were working in isolation.\u000d\u000a      This disconnected practice\u000d\u000a      led in some cases led to the multiple provision of facilities in some\u000d\u000a      areas, and elsewhere no\u000d\u000a      provision at all. It is now working practice that infrastructure providers\u000d\u000a      are core to the plan making\u000d\u000a      and delivery process, and this is reinforced through PPS12 [4],\u000d\u000a      the Planning Inspectorate's\u000d\u000a      mandatory independent examination of local plans and which refers to the Steps\u000d\u000a        Guide as\u000d\u000a      exemplary practice in achieving this goal. Various local police, health,\u000d\u000a      and fire services have all\u000d\u000a      considered different locations and modes of service delivery as a result\u000d\u000a      of UCL research and the\u000d\u000a      resultant methodological change in practice, and many have started to act\u000d\u000a      upon integrated\u000d\u000a      investment strategies. The Surrey police force, for instance, closed many\u000d\u000a      police stations from\u000d\u000a      2009-11 and redeveloped the released land and buildings land for other\u000d\u000a      uses from 2010 onwards.\u000d\u000a      It is now relocating its police services to town halls and libraries, thus\u000d\u000a      providing a `one-stop shop'\u000d\u000a      for the public [12]. Infrastructure delivery planning has also\u000d\u000a      promoted the co-location of facilities\u000d\u000a      and services to improve public access and reduce operating costs. Examples\u000d\u000a      here include: United\u000d\u000a      Utilities in Lancashire and Cumbria engaging proactively in infrastructure\u000d\u000a      planning processes to\u000d\u000a      improve practices in water supply management and new development plans; in\u000d\u000a      Sunderland,\u000d\u000a      primary health services have been delivered jointly with older people's\u000d\u000a      housing, supporting\u000d\u000a      effective use of resources and complementary services for users; while in\u000d\u000a      the Black Country and\u000d\u000a      Greater Manchester, each statutory authority has produced single\u000d\u000a      integrated infrastructure\u000d\u000a      investment programme for their economic area, and promoting engagement\u000d\u000a      across boundaries.\u000d\u000a    (iv) Promotion of sustainable outcomes and community engagement:\u000d\u000a      All the local authorities\u000d\u000a      that are now preparing IDPs and neighbourhood plans engage in community\u000d\u000a      decision-making as\u000d\u000a      an integral part of the process, whereas previously this was only done as\u000d\u000a      separate processes and\u000d\u000a      failure to locate infrastructure in the most effective locations for\u000d\u000a      community access and\u000d\u000a      sustainability. In turn, this has led to infrastructure investment being\u000d\u000a      based more on community\u000d\u000a      priorities. For example, in urban areas such as Lewisham, Camden and\u000d\u000a      Wandsworth the method\u000d\u000a      has led to more efficient use of scarce accessible land resources and the\u000d\u000a      reutilisation of brown-field\u000d\u000a      sites for housing. Infrastructure provision has also become more closely\u000d\u000a      integrated with\u000d\u000a      existing communities rather than just focussing on new development as in\u000d\u000a      previous practice.\u000d\u000a    In Bristol, the IDPs were used to make a case for major investment in a\u000d\u000a      public transit link in 2011\u000d\u000a      which has resulted in planning applications for three key links and\u000d\u000a      inclusion in the sub-regional\u000d\u000a      programme [13]. This use of the IDP process to engage\u000d\u000a      infrastructure providers including\u000d\u000a      highways, education, health and their committed investment in\u000d\u000a      Gloucestershire (2009 onwards)\u000d\u000a      has led to specific joint working on infrastructure assets, future needs\u000d\u000a      and energy requirements,\u000d\u000a      which again is leading to more efficient and coordinated investment in\u000d\u000a      facilities and the use of land.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted by Gallent, Morphet et al has revealed a lack of\u000d\u000a      understanding among\u000d\u000a      planners, local authorities and public sector infrastructure providers\u000d\u000a      about the key shift in spatial\u000d\u000a      planning in England since 2004 towards integrated deliverability.

Before 2008, practitioners and local\u000d\u000a      authorities had focused local\u000d\u000a      planning on the preparation of policy and not on its subsequent delivery\u000d\u000a      with partners. The report\u000d\u000a      [a] recommended that there should be a common evidence base on\u000d\u000a      infrastructure commitments\u000d\u000a      and requirements for plan preparation and shared between partners, which\u000d\u000a      is also available to the\u000d\u000a      public in a transparent way. The research also showed that it was\u000d\u000a      important that the regulatory role\u000d\u000a      of planning in local government and development management also has a key\u000d\u000a      role to play in\u000d\u000a      infrastructure delivery It also indicated that partners should work\u000d\u000a      towards greater horizontal and\u000d\u000a      vertical cooperation &#8212; i.e. across boundaries and in aligning investment\u000d\u000a      at different spatial scales.\u000d\u000a    The UCL research findings and recommendations in the final report were\u000d\u000a      used to build up a\u000d\u000a      powerful case for two new specific tools. The first of these was a Local\u000d\u000a      Infrastructure Programme,\u000d\u000a      incorporating a Local Infrastructure Fund managed by a Local\u000d\u000a        Infrastructure Group. It was\u000d\u000a      envisaged that this programme would deliver more effective resource\u000d\u000a      management and\u000d\u000a      coordination, based on a new approach to Infrastructure Delivery Planning\u000d\u000a      (IDP) that dealt\u000d\u000a      differently with capital commitments and coordination between partners [a,\u000d\u000a        d] as identified as good\u000d\u000a      practice from the case studies and interviews for the research. The second\u000d\u000a      tool recommended by\u000d\u000a      the research was a Regional Infrastructure Programme, comprising a Regional\u000d\u000a        Infrastructure Fund\u000d\u000a      and Regional Infrastructure Group, so as to support effective\u000d\u000a      resource management and planning\u000d\u000a      coordination at regional levels.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38378","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impacts from this research include direct influence on renewable\u000a      energy policy and practice in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and\u000a      internationally, involving public, NGO and private sectors. This is\u000a      reflected in the demand for Ellis as a speaker, having made over 40\u000a      presentations to national, international, academic and practitioner\u000a      audiences.\u000a    The impact having greatest reach is Ellis' role as the Irish National\u000a      Expert for IEA Task28 Working Group on Social Acceptance of Wind Energy\u000a      Projects. The IEA has 28 member countries and is one of the world's\u000a      leading energy authorities. Ellis's work on Task28 has included\u000a      participation in a series of high-level international meetings and\u000a      development of good-practice guidance, including co-authoring the Task28's\u000a      Final Report (2012) and its Recommended Practices for Social\u000a        Acceptance of Wind Energy Projects (2013). These were disseminated\u000a      at a global level, setting international standards for wind-energy\u000a      development and have been promoted by the European Wind Energy Association\u000a      among others. A corroborating statement confirms that Ellis:\u000a    `.... had an active and influential role in the Group's activities,\u000a        including helping to draft the Group's Final Report in 2012 and its\u000a        Recommended Practices Report in 2013. The expertise developed through\u000a      [Ellis'] peer-reviewed research provided a crucial input to the\u000a        development of these reports, which are being disseminated to\u000a        Governments, regulators, industry interests and other stakeholders\u000a        throughout the world.'\u000a    More specifically, this research has had a direct impact in Ireland, one\u000a      of the world's most wind-rich countries, via Ellis' work for the SEAI (the\u000a      national energy authority). This included authoring best-practice\u000a      principles for fostering social acceptance of wind energy projects. A\u000a      corroborating statement notes Ellis' expert contribution:\u000a    \"... on a number of initiatives aimed at helping [SEAI] understand\u000a        and formulate guidance for improving social acceptance of renewable\u000a        developments ... which reflects our view that [Ellis is] the\u000a        leading authority on social acceptance on the island of Ireland and we\u000a        welcome the advice [provided] in this capacity.\"\u000a    Ellis has also acted as an independent expert witness to the NI Assembly\u000a      Environment Committee's enquiry into wind energy.\u000a    Although it is difficult to provide evidence for a direct impact in other\u000a      jurisdictions, many issues raised in Ellis' research are being addressed\u000a      throughout the UK, such as the emphasis on community energy and\u000a      awareness-raising activities of organisations such as the Joseph Rowntree\u000a      Foundation. For example the Fermanagh Trust, drew on Ellis' work in its\u000a      report on community energy in NI, which itself has stimulated government\u000a      policy in this area. Their corroborating statement notes:\u000a    \"... this research and policy advice has played a very important role\u000a        in developing our position on these issues and that [Ellis']\u000a        expertise in this area has had an influential role on a number of\u000a        stakeholders throughout Northern Ireland and beyond.\"\u000a    In addition to policy influence, the research has had impact on the\u000a      practice of wind developers, with Ellis being asked to address the 2013 UK\u000a      staff training day of RES (a leading developer) and the 2013 Wind Energy\u000a      Developers Congress in Berlin. More widely, many developers now employ\u000a      community-liaison officers informed by Ellis' work, while the Irish Wind\u000a      Energy Association and the NI Renewable Industry Group have adopted\u000a      protocols for securing community benefits, as called for in Ellis' 2012\u000a      SEAI report. A corroborating statement from one developer, notes:\u000a    \"...exposure to [Ellis'] work has certainly been useful for us to\u000a        reflect on the social and policy environment in which we work and the\u000a        nature of our approach to community engagement as followed in our\u000a        projects.\"\u000a    Finally, Ellis' et al recent work on devolution and renewables were\u000a      presented at Welsh and NI Assembly committees, the Westminster\u000a      Parliamentary Renewable and Sustainable Energy Group and at events in\u000a      Aberdeen, Belfast, Cardiff and Dublin. These had more than 250 high-level\u000a      participants, findings reported by more than 60 UK newspapers (A, below)\u000a      and cited by the Scottish First Minister (B). A subsequent paper published\u000a      in the Political Quarterly was also covered by the press,\u000a      influencing the debate on Scottish independence (C). Recent work for\u000a      Ireland's National Economic and Social Council will also directly advise\u000a      Ireland's Prime Minister.\u000a    This work has piloted the research on the social interaction with\u000a      renewable energy and how it can be integrated into policy and practice.\u000a      Combined with high level dissemination, press coverage and agenda-setting\u000a      academic papers makes a persuasive case for claiming international impact.\u000a      While it is possible to provide examples of impact from the last six\u000a      years, the increasingly deployment of renewables and the need to rapidly\u000a      decarbonise, will ensure that its relevance will continue into the\u000a      foreseeable future.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes the policy impact of research on the deployment\u000a      of renewable energy in Ireland, the UK and internationally.

Using innovative methods, it developed a\u000a      novel critique of the dominant `NIMBY' discourse that has (mis)informed\u000a      debates about opposition to renewable energy projects&#8212;even at UK\u000a      ministerial level (see http:\/\/bit.ly\/1075d9M).\u000a      It showed that dominant terms of reference have exacerbated the weak\u000a      community acceptance of wind projects. The project undermined the\u000a      stereotype of wind-farm objectors as monolithic, irrational and `deviant',\u000a      showing a variety of attitudes and rationalities for opposition and\u000a      support. It found that the adversarial discourse prevented positive\u000a      engagement, often condemning developments to prolonged opposition, when\u000a      rapid deployment was needed to meet renewable-energy targets. It\u000a      highlighted the need for a more nuanced understanding of disputes and for\u000a      developers and policy-makers to respond to local concerns through enhanced\u000a      community benefits, public participation and more sensitive appreciation\u000a      of project impacts. It also highlighted the impact of governance\u000a      structures and decision-making processes on attitudes to renewable-energy\u000a      development. This project led to a number of highly citied research papers\u000a      (e.g. Ellis et al. 2008) and disseminated via stakeholder\u000a      workshops.\u000a    These insights led to engagement with scholars from other institutions,\u000a      including Cowell (Cardiff University), Strachan (RGU Aberdeen), Warren\u000a      (St. Andrews), Szarka (Bath University) and Toke (Birmingham\/Aberdeen\u000a      universities). Projects included an ESRC seminar series (Where Next for\u000a        Wind, RES-62-232526, 2007-09, Ellis CI) that involved discussion\u000a      with over 150 leading stakeholders from government, community and\u000a      industrial interests, leading to further outputs, some specifically aimed\u000a      at the planning-practitioner community (e.g. Ellis et al, 20092,3). This\u000a      led to new research directions for assessing the policy lessons arising\u000a      from devolution through a major ESRC project (RES-062-23-2526, 2011-2013,\u000a      Ellis CI4) involving researchers across the UK. The end of this\u000a      project coincided with a major dissemination programme across the UK which\u000a      led to extensive press coverage and the impacts discussed below.\u000a    This work also led to opportunities to directly shape Irish national\u000a      energy policy, through the development of best practice for social\u000a      acceptance for the Sustainable Energy Agency Ireland (SEAI 20125),\u000a      and through this work Ellis was appointed the Irish National Expert for\u000a      the International Energy Agency's work in this area. This has led to Ellis\u000a      being a key author on the IEA's Recommended Practices for Social\u000a        Acceptance of Wind Energy Projects (20136), which has\u000a      been taken up by national governments, local authorities and wind-energy\u000a      developers throughout the world and promoted by wind energy agencies in\u000a      Europe and North America. More recently, Ellis has been part of a team\u000a      preparing a report on Transforming the Irish Energy System for the\u000a      National Economic and Social Council (http:\/\/www.nesc.ie\/\u000a      ), which directly advises the Taoiseach on strategic issues for Ireland's\u000a      economic and social development.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38379","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has led to significant publications on a subject about which\u000d\u000a      little was previously known and documented.

Belfast, An Illustrated Architectural Guide,\u000d\u000a      (1988) has been used as an authority for the listing of many buildings in\u000d\u000a      the city generally, while his book The Architectural Heritage of\u000d\u000a        Malone and Stranmillis (1991) has been used as the authority for\u000d\u000a      many listings in the Malone and Stranmillis suburb of Belfast (see Section\u000d\u000a      5, nos. 4 &amp; 5).\u000d\u000a    Scheduling of Conservation Areas\u000d\u000a      Similarly, Planning Authorities in Northern Ireland have been clearly\u000d\u000a      influenced in their selection of Conservation areas by the research (with\u000d\u000a      citation in designation booklets) eg , `Cathedral' in 1990, `Linen' in\u000d\u000a      1992, `Malone Park' in 1993, `Adelaide Park' in 1993, `Stranmillis' in\u000d\u000a      1996, `Belfast City Centre' in 1998 and `Malone' in 2000 (see Section 5a,\u000d\u000a      no. 2).\u000d\u000a    These earlier impacts have had an on-going effect during this REF period\u000d\u000a      where it is evident that those individual listings are being maintained\u000d\u000a      and those Conservation Areas are being kept intact, while there is also\u000d\u000a      clear evidence that the impact is gaining momentum.\u000d\u000a    Overall value of impact Cumulatively these impacts have led\u000d\u000a      to the identification, conservation, presentation and eventual marketing\u000d\u000a      of the best of the historic built heritage, by those with responsibility\u000d\u000a      for it, as well as the inculcation of a deeper awareness, understanding\u000d\u000a      and appreciation by those who use it. Thus the status and profile of\u000d\u000a      historic architecture in Northern Ireland have been raised by this\u000d\u000a      research and associated publications.\u000d\u000a    Aside from the direct and measurable benefit of helping to secure for the\u000d\u000a      future the best of our architectural heritage, this research can also\u000d\u000a      claim to have played an important part in the strengthening of the wider\u000d\u000a      cultural base in Northern Ireland. This cultural reconnection is now\u000d\u000a      stimulating urban regeneration and encouraging cultural tourism. Thus the\u000d\u000a      impact of the work, although geographically local, is considerable, and\u000d\u000a      over a long and lasting period, affecting a wide range of stakeholders and\u000d\u000a      groups.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Architectural history at Queens has not only critically influenced\u000d\u000a      decision-makers in Northern Ireland over a long period, but also helped to\u000d\u000a      develop a notion of shared ownership of the region within the extant\u000d\u000a      divisions in the contested landscape of Northern Ireland.

Similarly, the work of Sterrett and\u000d\u000a        Gaffikin was adopted by the Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan, which\u000d\u000a        uniquely acknowledged the significance of sectarian spatial divisions in\u000d\u000a        the urban area.\u000d\u000a      The Strategic Local Partnership, set up to achieve a twin process of\u000d\u000a        regeneration with reconciliation, adopted a strategy of One City, based\u000d\u000a        on the analysis generated by this research about planning in contested\u000d\u000a        space (2005).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Influencing Legislation and Policy\u000d\u000a    Connected to the above work, it helped to introduce the concept of\u000d\u000a      long-term vision planning, inviting inventive scenarios beyond violent\u000d\u000a      conflict; and ensured that the challenge of sociosectarian division was\u000d\u000a      embedded into the local &#8212; regional scale. This impact is evident in a\u000d\u000a      number of key areas of planning practice. For example:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aSterrett's joint authoring of the publication `Government\u000d\u000a          Action for our Urban Environment' (May 2011) triggered a series of\u000d\u000a        significant impacts. Following meetings with four key ministers\u000d\u000a        (May-October 2011), a joint ministerial summit on urban design was held\u000d\u000a        (January 2012) with two key outcomes: (1) a government-sponsored Winter\u000d\u000a        School to explore how a new approach to urban planning and design could\u000d\u000a        address spatial issues in inner north Belfast (March 2012) and (2)\u000d\u000a        publication of new cross-departmental policy on `Urban Stewardship\u000d\u000a          and Design' (February 2013). Explicitly acknowledged is the fact\u000d\u000a        that: `Northern Ireland has a unique set of socio-political\u000d\u000a          circumstances ... (with) a legacy of division ... materialising in\u000d\u000a          many of our urban centres and inner city neighbourhoods.' It goes\u000d\u000a        on to refer to `the long term objective of a shared future (with the\u000d\u000a          need to) avoid the creation of near permanent barriers, be they\u000d\u000a          physical or perceived set within the structure of our urban areas.'\u000d\u000a        This breaks completely new ground in this neglected area.\u000d\u000a      Parallel research work on urban structure and form by Sterrett\u000d\u000a        with the co-directors of the Forum for Alternative Belfast has\u000d\u000a        also seen two official local masterplans being taken forward by Belfast\u000d\u000a        City Council's Masterplan, again a break-through initiative (June 2013);\u000d\u000a      An urban design scheme (researched and developed by Sterrett\u000d\u000a        in partnership with the Forum for an Alternative Belfast) -\u000d\u000a        challenging the design of a major &#163;100m regional roads proposal that\u000d\u000a        would have further segmented the contested space of north Belfast -\u000d\u000a        influenced government's eventual adoption of a more progressive option.\u000d\u000a        This offers the potential for better pedestrian connections and\u000d\u000a        regeneration of the area.

Most tellingly, following\u000d\u000a      this briefing with the Minister he requested a paper outlining the key\u000d\u000a      lessons from our work, to help him develop an operational agenda about how\u000d\u000a      new planning could redress the intractable problem of socio-spatial\u000d\u000a      division. Moreover, he asked for us to specify how civic capacity to\u000d\u000a      deliver such an agenda could be enhanced (May 2013); This engagement led\u000d\u000a      to:\u000d\u000a       introduction of spatial analysis of ethno-religious\/ social divisions\u000d\u000a        into the Department of Environment's manual for preparing statutory\u000d\u000a        spatial plans (2013), and inclusion of new policy on spatial segregation\u000d\u000a        and the creation of shared space within the DoE's new Single Planning\u000d\u000a        Policy Document (Summer 2013), which sets the framework for development\u000d\u000a        planning and management.

They have assessed the links between identity and\u000d\u000a      territory in deeply divided cities; developed typologies of urban space in\u000d\u000a      those contentious contexts; emphasised the need to shift from regulatory\u000d\u000a      land-use planning to a more proactive spatial planning, geared to\u000d\u000a      addressing socio-spatial division; and devised effective planning that can\u000d\u000a      help the painstaking building of peace in urban streets and neighbourhoods\u000d\u000a      as well as around the big political table.

Efforts to mitigate the\u000a      impacts of climate change rely heavily on a changed approach in the\u000a      transport sector (typically 20-40% of CO2 emissions at the city\u000a      level). The research described above has led directly and indirectly to\u000a      significant changes in policy determining how the transport sector\u000a      responds to the challenge of climate change, in multiple jurisdictions in\u000a      the UK and internationally.\u000a    (i) Informing changes in UK city-wide, regional and national policy\u000a        and investment:\u000a    Prior to 2006 there was little, if any, consideration of climate change\u000a      in UK transport planning. Since then, the need to reduce transport CO2\u000a      emissions has featured prominently in all strategy development, usually as\u000a      one of the primary objectives for the strategy. This major shift in\u000a      emphasis has been informed, in part, by findings from the VIBAT studies,\u000a      which were the first to consider this issue at the national level. Those\u000a      findings have been disseminated at a huge range of seminars, conferences,\u000a      workshops and publications, including over 50 presentations by Hickman [1].\u000a      In 2006, Hickman and Banister held a lunchtime seminar on the VIBAT-UK\u000a      study for transport experts at the UK Department for Transport (DfT).\u000a      Written and oral submissions were also made to the Environmental Audit\u000a      Select Committee (EAC) at the House of Commons, and the final EAC report\u000a      cited the VIBAT work substantively, and requested that the DfT\u000a      become more progressive on this topic. Since then, there have been\u000a      significant changes in national, regional and city-based transport\u000a      strategies, investment programmes, local masterplanning and urban planning\u000a      strategies, at all scales of transport planning, and in multiple contexts.\u000a      These have included much increased funding in public transport, walking\u000a      and cycling (through dedicated transport funds in London and the Local\u000a      Transport Plan mechanism in the UK); an increased use of urban planning as\u000a      an instrument within transport planning; and revised street design\u000a      approaches. In addition, a Local Sustainable Transport Fund of over &#163;100\u000a      million has been provided by the DfT.\u000a    The BSP research was carried out largely with city authorities, using a\u000a      participatory approach that brought in local officers and politicians to\u000a      help develop transport strategies and investment programmes over the long\u000a      term (up to 2026 and beyond). Accordingly, it has fed into spatial and\u000a      transport strategies and revised investment programmes devised by city and\u000a      regional authorities. Notable examples since 2008 include the use of the\u000a      research to inform the London's Mayoral Transport Strategy (Transport for\u000a      London, or TfL, and GLA, 2009, 2011) [2, 3], which now includes\u000a      reducing transport CO2 emissions as a major objective; and in\u000a      Local Transport Plans and Delivering a Sustainable Transport System\u000a      (DaSTS) studies for the Oxfordshire (2011) [4] and Swindon (2010)\u000a      LTPs, where investment programmes have been developed to help reduce\u000a      transport CO2 emissions. These will be implemented over the\u000a      next 10-20 years and aim to significantly change travel behaviours and\u000a      reduce CO2 transport emissions.\u000a    The research has also facilitated a shift in policy approach at the\u000a      national level towards low carbon transport, including a new emphasis on\u000a      the need to consider alternative futures over the long-term. Thus, for\u000a      example, the 2011 White Paper Cutting Carbon, Creating Growth: Making\u000a      Sustainable Local Transport Happen by DfT [5] considers climate\u000a      change as a major objective, takes a longer-term approach to strategy\u000a      development over 20 years and includes consideration of the range of\u000a      measures considered in the VIBAT studies.\u000a    (ii) Emerging changes in travel behaviour:\u000a    This improved awareness of the role of transport in reducing CO2\u000a      emissions, and the changing strategy and investment programmes, has begun\u000a      to translate into changes in transport funding patterns and, subsequently,\u000a      in travel behaviour. More specifically, investment has been made in public\u000a      transport, walking and cycling, and the use of urban planning to help\u000a      support transport investments. This has been one of several important\u000a      factors responsible for changes in travel behaviours, including less car\u000a      usage and greater use of public transport, walking and cycling. Some\u000a      studies of recent trends suggest that car usage is beginning to peak in\u000a      certain urban areas in the UK (particularly London), and that public\u000a      transport, walking and cycling are increasing in popularity (e.g. LeVine\u000a      and Jones, On the Move, 2012). Although by no means the only\u000a      factors, the changed policy and investment approach at the urban level &#8212;\u000a      supported by the use of the VIBAT studies to demonstrate realistic\u000a      investment policies for city authorities &#8212; has contributed to this.\u000a    (iii) Influence on international policy:\u000a    The VIBAT studies have similarly influenced strategy and policy\u000a      development in international contexts. Research by Hickman et al [d]\u000a      has had a particularly significant impact on the development of policy in\u000a      Asia. Here, the sustainable urban transport concept, closely linked with\u000a      the need to reduce transport CO2 emissions, is now the dominant\u000a      policy approach and forms a central element of transport planning and\u000a      major project investment by the Asian Development Bank. This has led to\u000a      significant investment in public transport, walking and cycling, as\u000a      alternatives to the private car, although of course there is a long way to\u000a      go before sustainable travel behaviours are achieved internationally. The\u000a      sustainable mobility approach is being further developed in related work\u000a      by Hickman et al on multimodal interchange design in China (forthcoming in\u000a      2014).\u000a    (iv) Take-up of BSP methodologies in governmental and consultancy and\u000a        academic work:\u000a    Key methodologies developed through the VIBAT research include\u000a      scenario analysis and backcasting; methods to quantify policy impacts and\u000a      assess the likelihood of policy targets being met (such as the UK CO2\u000a      emission reduction target and London Mayoral CO2 emission\u000a      reduction target in London); simulation gaming and participatory scenario\u000a      development. Since 2008, these approaches have been used in many other\u000a      governmental, consultancy and academic studies (beyond the work of Hickman\u000a      and Banister), including in work conducted by national and international\u000a      policy-making organisations. The quantification of scenarios, for example,\u000a      which was rarely used in the transport sector before the VIBAT-UK\u000a      study, is now well used in almost all studies in mitigation in transport,\u000a      providing a much clearer evidence base for policy makers. The UCL\u000a      approaches have also been applied in the EU Logman and EU OPTIC projects,\u000a      which applied very similar scenario development methodologies in to\u000a      freight (rather than passenger) transport. Similarly, scenario analysis\u000a      and backcasting (developed and applied in the transport sector in the VIBAT\u000a      studies) have been used as part of the 2008-10 FP7 EU Freightvision\u000a      project on long-term futures for freight transport in Europe [6].\u000a    They have also been used at the UK governmental level, for example in\u000a      publications seeking to quantify the impact of policy measures against\u000a      targets. Important examples include the 2008 Delivering a Sustainable\u000a        Transport Strategy and Carbon Pathways Analysis (both by\u000a      DfT), and the 2009 documents on Low Carbon Transport: A Greener\u000a        Future. A Carbon Reduction Strategy for Transport (DfT) and An\u000a        Analysis of Urban Transport (Cabinet Office), the latter an\u000a      important document feeding into the development of national transport\u000a      strategy and funding levels for local authorities, including in Local\u000a      Transport Plans [7]. All of these, in fact, used BSP approaches to\u000a      quantify the likely impact of scenarios and strategies; BSP research also\u000a      informed their new focus on reducing transport CO2 emissions\u000a      and using urban planning to reduce car dependency.\u000a    The approach have also underpinned UK consultancy studies, such as those\u000a      by Halcrow\/CH2M (jointly with the BSP) [8], WS Atkins, and Arup in\u000a      the Guildford Transport Strategy, which made direct use of the VIBAT\u000a      approaches in scenario development, visioning and scenario quantification.\u000a      This has improved awareness of robust and practical approaches to reducing\u000a      transport CO2 emissions. The BSP methods have also been used in\u000a      international studies such as those by AEA Technology in the EU\u000a        Transport GHG: Routes to 2050 Project (2010) and in various Asian\u000a      Development Bank projects. These include their global regional modelling\u000a      of low carbon transport pathways in the ASEAN region, considering policy\u000a      approaches that can be taken in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,\u000a      Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand (2011-14); and studies on sustainable\u000a      mobility and investments in sustainable transport projects [8].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on sustainable transport conducted by Hickman et al at UCL has\u000a      contributed significantly to a major shift in UK and international\u000a      transport policy during the last decade.

A key strand of this is work on sustainable transport led by Dr\u000a      Robin Hickman (researcher\/visiting lecturer at BSP from 2004, and Senior\u000a      Lecturer since 2011), in association with Professor David Banister (who\u000a      worked at UCL up to 2006, subsequently Oxford University), and in\u000a      partnership with engineering, planning and urban design consultancies such\u000a      as CH2M Hill\/Halcrow and Space Syntax Ltd.\u000a    Impacts on the development of sustainable urban transport systems are\u000a      underpinned particularly by research from 2004 onwards involving the\u000a      development and modification of approaches in scenario analysis and their\u000a      application to sustainable transport strategy and investment programme\u000a      development. This has included the development of innovative approaches in\u000a      scenario development, visioning, backcasting, scenario quantification and\u000a      modelling, multi-criteria appraisal (MCA) against scenarios, and\u000a      participatory involvement in scenarios. Much of this was highly original\u000a      research, developed to challenge the projected increase in transport CO2\u000a      emissions and develop alternative policy and investment approaches.\u000a      Simulation modelling\/games (i.e. transport and carbon simulations and\u000a      integrated transport and simulation decision support tools) were also\u000a      designed to help take the decision-making process to a wider group of\u000a      stakeholders, including politicians, civil society, the public, and\u000a      technical specialists at the city authority level. These approaches were\u000a      developed by Hickman, Banister and wider team members during work with the\u000a      UK Department for Transport, Transport for London and other city\u000a      authorities.\u000a    Between 2004 and 2012, the UCL team developed both qualitative and\u000a      quantitative scenario approaches allowing, for example, quantification of\u000a      the likely impact of policy measures &#8212; both in combination and as\u000a      synergetic strategies &#8212; over the long term (up to 2030 and 2050) and in\u000a      participation with local stakeholders. These constituted novel and\u000a      little-used approaches to transport planning. The work was conducted at\u000a      the BSP by Hickman and Banister, the first for the UK Department for\u000a      Transport's Horizons Programme (Visioning and Backcasting for\u000a        Transport: VIBAT-UK, 2004-06) (Banister as principal investigator\u000a      and Hickman as lead researcher). The key insight of this was the\u000a      requirement for behavioural, as well as technological, responses to low\u000a      transport CO2 emissions [a]. In other words, it\u000a      identified a need for much greater use of walking, cycling, public\u000a      transport and urban planning, as well as low emission vehicles, to\u000a      significantly reduce transport CO2 emissions. The second major\u000a      study (VIBAT-London, 2007-09) was carried out by Hickman (principal\u000a      investigator) with Banister and others as part of the UrbanBuzz programme,\u000a      led by UCL and developed in association with Halcrow, Space Syntax,\u000a      Transport for London and the Greater London Authority. Here, the research\u000a      focus was on the potential for low-carbon transport pathways to be\u000a      developed and implemented in London, and the likelihood of meeting the\u000a      Mayoral CO2 emission reduction target in transport. The study\u000a      considered the range of policy measures available in London, modelled\u000a      levels of application and investment, and explored strategies and\u000a      strategic choices available to decision-makers. A simulation modelling\u000a      game (TC-SIM) was developed to illustrate the strategic choices available\u000a      and the trade-offs against CO2 reduction, political and\u000a      financial deliverability. The research recommendations included: reducing\u000a      average vehicle emissions to below 95 gCO2\/km by 2025;\u000a      increasing the use of biofuels to around 10% of the fleet; radically\u000a      increasing the use of urban densities and mixed uses around public\u000a      transport interchanges (including in suburban locations); increasing the\u000a      geographical scope of the congestion charge across London (and charging\u000a      against emissions); increasing levels of investment in public transport,\u000a      walking and cycling; and considering international flying emissions in the\u000a      Mayor of London's target [b].\u000a    A series of related studies conducted since 2009 have allowed the UCL\u000a      team to test the application of the strategy development work in both UK\u000a      and international contexts. These have involved the development &#8212; and in\u000a      many cases modelling &#8212; of wide-ranging and integrated strategies,\u000a      including different levels of application of a range of policy measures\u000a      such as those mentioned above. The studies have supported the development\u000a      of context-specific low carbon transport strategies and pathways tailored\u000a      to meet particular problems and opportunities. Specific applications have\u000a      included the use of scenarios and multi-criteria appraisal in Oxfordshire\u000a      (for Oxfordshire County Council) and Swindon (for Swindon Borough Council\u000a      and the DfT). Here the research was used to provide an evidence base to\u000a      help develop the Local Transport Plan. The work was also discussed with\u000a      local stakeholders, politicians and the public [c].\u000a    Elsewhere, the same research has been applied for Transport Canada in\u000a      Victoria, in Auckland for the University of Auckland and Auckland Council,\u000a      and also in an Asian context via projects in Delhi (for Asian Development\u000a      Bank) and Jinan, China (University of Oxford, Future of Cities Programme)\u000a      [d]. In each, a low-carbon transport strategy and investment\u000a      programme was developed and policy measures suggested for investment by\u000a      the city authority. Further simulation modelling games were developed for\u000a      Swindon and Auckland, this time with MCA application against low CO2\u000a      transport strategies.

It concluded\u000d\u000a      that community physical activity levels and social inclusion were\u000d\u000a      dependent on access to local, everyday destinations and facilities.\u000d\u000a    2000-2008: Land use standards for local accessibility were\u000d\u000a      established (Barton) and through research with a network of\u000d\u000a      European cities, culminated in the development of the critical concept of\u000d\u000a      `Healthy Urban Planning' (HUP) (R2, 3, 4). The conclusion of this work was\u000d\u000a      the identification of 12 key objectives for HUP (R5). These objectives\u000d\u000a      translate key World Health Organization (WHO) health priorities such as\u000d\u000a      less obesity, better food access, fewer respiratory problems, better\u000d\u000a      mental health and a reduction in health inequalities, into spatial\u000d\u000a      criteria including access to local green space, access to local jobs, and\u000d\u000a      development of mixed, inclusive communities. Our research repeatedly\u000d\u000a      concluded that knowledge translation from the public health discipline to\u000d\u000a      planning is fundamental for creating healthier places. Through studying\u000d\u000a      the methodologies employed by cities active in HUP, an overarching\u000d\u000a      conceptual model for sustainability and health in the built environment\u000d\u000a      was developed and empirically tested. This was conceptualised as the\u000d\u000a      `Health Map' (R3,4), a now much used visual conceptual tool, with people's\u000d\u000a      health at the centre and global sustainability on the perimeter, clearly\u000d\u000a      indicating the required specific spatial planning and urban design\u000d\u000a      interventions. From 2000 onwards a sustained longitudinal research\u000d\u000a      programme was implemented. This included a time-series of annual analyses\u000d\u000a      of the implementation of HUP in 70-100 cities in the WHO European Healthy\u000d\u000a      Cities programme (R6).\u000d\u000a    2008-2013: Under the EPSRC's Sustainable Urban Environments\u000d\u000a      Programme, the WHO CC investigated local neighbourhood\u000d\u000a      accessibility and found significantly different walkability access\u000d\u000a      outcomes arising from different urban form archetypes (Barton and Grant).\u000a      Parallel analysis of population data supported setting design standards\u000d\u000a      for distance thresholds for walking access to local facilities. This,\u000d\u000a      together with a pilot study, supported refinement of a threshold technique\u000d\u000a      for participatory impact appraisal of development proposals. The `Health\u000d\u000a      Map' was then strengthened through evidence studies of spatial elements\u000d\u000a      that present risks and challenges to health in urban environments (Barton\u000d\u000a      and Grant) (R6). In particular, findings based on trials with a\u000d\u000a      range of disciplinary stakeholders lead to modifications and design\u000d\u000a      optimisation. As part of designation as the NICE Collaborating Centre for\u000d\u000a      Spatial Planning and Health, seven aspects of health in spatial planning\u000d\u000a      across different national planning systems at a trans-disciplinary policy\u000d\u000a      and capacity level were studied in depth (Carmichael, Gray and Pilkington)\u000d\u000a      (R7). Through systematic analysis of studies from European countries this\u000d\u000a      identified both systemic facilitators and blocks. It identified that the\u000d\u000a      separate structural and paradigmatic spaces occupied by public health and\u000d\u000a      built environment professions are a key blockage to developing healthier\u000d\u000a      settlements. Crucially, the research described the conditions under which\u000d\u000a      the wider determinants of health can be supported in spatial and urban\u000d\u000a      planning, leading to more effective, impact-focused activity (R 8,9).\u000d\u000a    Key research staff: Hugh Barton, 1973-2012, Professor of\u000d\u000a      Health and Sustainability; Laurence Carmichael, 2002-present,\u000d\u000a      Senior Lecturer; Stuart Farthing,1973-2011, Principal Lecturer; Colin\u000a        Fudge, 1995-2008, Executive Dean and Chair of EU Expert Group on the\u000d\u000a      Urban Environment; Marcus Grant, 1997-present, Associate Professor\u000d\u000a      for Healthy Urban Environments; Selena Gray 2002-present,\u000d\u000a      Professor of Public Health (in UoA3, Allied Health Professions\u000d\u000a      submission); Paul Pilkington, 2006-present, Senior Lecturer (in\u000d\u000a      UoA22, Social Work and Social Policy submission); John Winter,\u000d\u000a      1970-2003, Associate Dean.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40787","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Travel information can empower individuals through raising awareness of\u000a      travel options, informing travel choices and supporting the execution of\u000a      journeys. With the information age moving into full-flight, Prime\u000a      Minister Blair had a vision for a service, akin to NHS Direct, to support\u000a      travellers.\u000a    Unusually, the concept of Transport Direct was not a recommendation from\u000a      senior civil servants to ministers, but instead a top-down instruction\u000a      from Prime Minister Blair. The Department for Transport (DfT) did not\u000a      possess sufficient expertise internally to preside over transforming a\u000a      Number 10 vision into a reality. Accordingly it established, in 2002, an\u000a      `expert client team' which involved seconding key external experts into\u000a      DfT, one of whom was Lyons from UWE &#8212; the only representative of\u000a      academia on the team. He was appointed Senior User on the Project Board of\u000a      the multi-million pound Design-Build-Operate contract to develop and\u000a      deliver the service, and was also Chairman of the DfT's Transport Direct\u000a      Research Steering Group. His secondment lasted for two years with\u000a      continued involvement as a consultant until 2007 - devising and presiding\u000a      over a major research programme of over 13 projects tailored to support\u000a      Transport Direct's delivery.\u000a    Lyons (with Kenyon) shaped early thinking on online travel\u000a      information by developing key usability principles to ensure information\u000a      was useful, usable and used. The work of Lyons and CTS\u000a      colleagues has gone on to be a key factor in shaping Transport Direct\u000a      throughout its lifetime of major developments and use to date. Building\u000a      upon earlier impacts during the initial design, build and launch stages of\u000a      Transport Direct, impacts &#8212; on the policy community, the public and the\u000a      international community &#8212; have occurred in the following four areas within\u000a      the REF census period (2008-2013).\u000a    Design principles of the Transport Direct service and governance of\u000a          service development\u000a      DfT's Transport Direct Division had not originally appreciated the\u000a      importance of the principles of usability of service design. Following Lyons'\u000a      advice with supporting work by Kenyon on usability, a major\u000a      investment was made to provide extensive usability-centred design and\u000a      testing. This led to major changes in the design of the service including\u000a      greater orientation towards users' needs, notably for those with\u000a      disabilities such as dyslexia. Lyons played a significant role in\u000a      re-orienting the service from a policy-driven approach (to encourage the\u000a      use of public transport rather than cars) to one of empowering individuals\u000a      to make informed choices (irrespective of outcome decisions):\"Without\u000a      Glenn Lyons' input in the early development of Transport Direct, it would\u000a      have been driven solely by policy rather than by the needs of `real\u000a      people'' (Transport Direct Chief Executive) (S1).\u000a    DfT officials have pointed out that it would not have been possible to\u000a      justify the sums of money and the risks of changing the main website\u000a      design over time were it not for CTS's research expertise.\u000a      This was able to demonstrate to senior civil servants and ministers that\u000a      the service's development was based on academically sound principles and\u000a      was capable of meeting business requirements. CTS's\u000a      research insights have helped guide the service through its\u000a      extraordinarily complex journey from conception as a pipe dream to today's\u000a      reality which accommodates around 100 billion journey combinations.\u000a    The marketing strategy of Transport Direct has been influenced by the CTS\u000a      research finding that promoting public transport information is\u000a      not an effective way of promoting public transport use; on the\u000a      contrary, public transport itself needs to be promoted, from which derives\u000a      a demand for information use. The Transport Direct Division is now less\u000a      concerned with marketing the service directly to users than with\u000a      encouraging third party organisations to use it with their own branding\u000a      (`white-labelling').\u000a    Use of the service by the travelling public\u000a      Since its launch at the end of 2004, Transport Direct had handled over 110\u000a      million enquiries (as at September 2012) and continues to address some\u000a      378,000 enquiries per week (S3). Transport Direct's own commissioned\u000a      research (S4) has found that, of those individuals (nearly two thirds of\u000a      respondents) who were seeking information on a journey they had made\u000a      before , 7.7% intended, as a consequence of using the service, to use\u000a      public transport instead of the car, while 2.3% intended to use the car\u000a      instead of public transport. Thus not only is the information service\u000a      being used by the public but is also influencing travel\u000a        behaviour.\u000a    DfT's influence on wider developments\u000a      In discussions with Lyons on 25 November 2011, DfT officials\u000a      described the contribution of the research of staff at CTS\u000a      as follows: \"The ongoing research and interaction with service development\u000a      has resulted in an accumulation of knowledge. It has taken time to bring\u000a      about changes in the industry &#8212; waves of promotion of latest knowledge run\u000a      up against the barriers of established\/entrenched thinking. Only through\u000a      successful waves building up can the barriers eventually be breached\"\u000a      (Transport Direct Chief Executive) (S1). This case study is seen by DfT as\u000a      an exemplar of research and policy implementation working together. DfT\u000a      has, through its explicit engagement with CTS's research,\u000a      been able to operate as a voice of influence in the wider arena of travel\u000a      information developments. This has been important in working with the many\u000a      national stakeholders (data owners, travel information and transport\u000a      service providers). Lyons has continued to be consulted as a\u000a      source of expert advice both nationally and internationally (e.g.\u000a      advising, in 2012, a major French-based public transport operator on its\u000a      plans with an international technology company for developing an\u000a      `Intelligent Mobility' information service) (S5).\u000a    Wider influence has resulted in the UK being seen as a trail blazer in\u000a      this field by other countries. Specific examples of Transport Direct\u000a      influence include the US service 511 (a telephone\/web resource for\u000a      transport in the San Francisco Bay Area) and the Dutch online national\u000a      public transport journey planner `9292'. Particularly poignant is the\u000a      impact of the Transport Direct `research and development journey'\u000a      culminating with the London 2012 Olympics. Transport Direct was selected\u000a      by the Olympic Delivery Authority to develop a bespoke online portal to\u000a      guide event ticket holders to and from the Olympic venues. The Spectator\u000a      Journey Planner had 2.75 million unique users (S3).\u000a    Ongoing repositioning of travel information provision as part of a\u000a          national policy agenda\u000a      At a time of huge financial pressures on public spending, it is\u000a      significant that Transport Direct has not been disbanded in the push to\u000a      make savings. This is seen to reflect the crucial change in perception\u000a      from Transport Direct being seen as a `toy' to it now being regarded as a\u000a      critical tool in an era where the power of information and social media is\u000a      being recognised, and where there is a need for governments to open up\u000a      data to enable innovation and economic development to flourish. Transport\u000a      Direct now sees itself as a major broker of data access with a focus on\u000a      driving up data quality.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    One third of a million people each week benefit from using the world's\u000a      first door-to-door national multimodal travel information service by\u000a      confirming, identifying or changing their travel plans.

He developed (with Kenyon),\u000a      insights into information content and design, and the potential\u000a      effectiveness of providing information on different transport modes in an\u000a      integrated manner in order to inform and influence travel behaviour (R1).\u000a      Integrated, multi-modal information draws together data from different\u000a      sources (e.g. bus and train operators), allowing the traveller to plan a\u000a      door-to-door journey using connecting services by different modes &#8212; a\u000a      planning process which was cumbersome before the web and did little to\u000a      encourage the consideration of alternatives to the use of the private car.\u000a      Lyons (following competitive tendering) subsequently conducted a\u000a      strategic review of travel information research &#8212; the first key piece of\u000a      research to inform the development of a national, multi-modal traveller\u000a      information system `Transport Direct'. The civil service had been\u000a      instructed to develop this system by Prime Minister, Tony Blair.\u000a    In recognition of his growing track-record in the field of web-based\u000a      traveller information, Lyons was also, in 2002, seconded to the\u000a      DfT's Transport Direct Division to form part of an `expert client team'\u000a      responsible for translating the Prime Minister's concept into a reality\u000a      (see Section 4). Here Lyons performed a key strategic role in\u000a      examining whether, and how, information is used before and during a trip,\u000a      and how this affects behaviour. This found that, contrary to prior\u000a      assumptions about decision-making and information-need, most people, most\u000a      of the time, do not consult information services (R2).\u000a    Lyons (with Campbell and Farag) subsequently\u000a      undertook major EPSRC-funded studies (2004-09) into information support\u000a      for unfamiliar travel, and barriers to information use. The latter adopted\u000a      a social-psychological approach which challenged conventional wisdom in\u000a      the travel information industry: rather than usage of travel information\u000a      driving consideration of public transport use, the reverse was true. Thus,\u000a      encouraging greater information use to promote public transport was not\u000a      the answer &#8212; public transport itself needs to be promoted, from which\u000a      derives a demand for information use (R3,4).\u000a    Allied research from Lyons' group explored factors shaping travel\u000a      decisions such as habit and `satisficing behaviour' (decision-making which\u000a      leads to satisfactory rather than optimal results). They found that such\u000a      factors limit the use of information and its consequences for travel mode\u000a      choice, as well as influencing the decision strategies which individuals\u000a      employ when planning journeys (R5). With Avineri , Lyons\u000a      won a competitive tender to lead the second government strategic review of\u000a      travel information research (2007), which underlined key distinctions\u000a      between the decision-making styles of homo-economicus\u000a      (characterised by Star Trek's Mr Spock) and homo-psychologicus\u000a      (characterised by Homer Simpson) (R6). This proved to be a simple but\u000a      powerful portrayal of some complex behavioural processes, and was adopted\u000a      and espoused by the Transport Direct team at the DfT.\u000a    Most recently Lyons led a major EPSRC\/DfT\/TSB study (2007-12)\u000a      into user innovation in information service provision in the face of\u000a      social media and open data, heralding a new era where government is\u000a      increasingly seen as an enabler for, as well as a direct provider of,\u000a      traveller information services. This has underlined the continuing\u000a      temptation for service providers to underestimate the importance of\u000a      understanding their end users and the contexts for information use in the\u000a      face of an era of major social and technological change.\u000a    Key research staff: Glenn Lyons, 2002-date, Professor of\u000a      Transport and Society; Susan Kenyon, 2002-2006, Research Fellow; Mhari\u000a        Campbell, 2004-2008, Research Fellow; Sendy Farag,\u000a      2006-2009, Research Fellow; Erel Avinieri, 2004-2012, Associate\u000a      Professor in Travel Behaviour.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40788","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has had an impact on urban and climate change discourse and\u000a      policies at international, national and local levels.\u000a    Impact on OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\u000a          Development) policies on suburbs within compact cities\u000a      The OECD sees the compact city as a significant plank of its Green Growth\u000a      agenda. In 2012, it launched a comprehensive report: Compact City\u000a        Policies: A Comparative Assessment (S1), which is `the first\u000a      comprehensive report across the world that redefines the concept of\u000a      compact city in today's context' (S2). Two of Williams' papers\u000a      (R3,7) are cited, providing evidence on the role of suburban areas in\u000a      future climate conditions, and cautioning the impacts on social\u000a      sustainability (p.70,71). She was subsequently invited by the OECD to\u000a      undertake an independent assessment of the report. The OECD's Senior\u000a      Policy Analyst for Regional Development Policy states that Williams'\u000a      research `provided an important insight that compact city policies may not\u000a      be a universal solution' (S2) and that `...by referring to her paper we\u000a      pointed out compact cities' risk against extreme weather and natural\u000a      disaster, which was lacking in previous draft versions' (S2), and that\u000a      `compaction may have a negative impact on privacy in the home and on\u000a      social interaction' (S2).\u000a    Impact on the National Adaptation Programme (for England) and on\u000a          Government's and industry's understanding of risks to suburbs from\u000a          climate change\u000a      The SNACC research was undertaken at a key time for UK climate change\u000a      policy development. Following the Climate Change Act (2008), the\u000a      Government published the National Adaptation Programme (NAP) (S3)\u000a      in July 2013. This sets out how government, businesses, communities\u000a      and civil society should prepare for, and adapt to, climate change.\u000a      Chapter 2 of the NAP `Built Environment' reports on future risks of\u000a      overheating and cites SNACC (p.26) as providing evidence on overheating\u000a      risks at neighbourhood and individual building levels. The Built\u000a      Environment chapter of the NAP, and the Government's broader understanding\u000a      of the problems of adaptation, are also informed by Williams et al's\u000a      research. DCLG's, Head of Climate Change and Sustainable Buildings\u000a      team reported that SNACC's findings have `strengthened the evidence base\u000a      underpinning the Built Environment chapter' (S4), and that findings on\u000a      `overheating, flood risk and the importance of community resilience were\u000a      particularly useful in helping DCLG officials and Ministers to\u000a      understand future climate risks' (S4). He also valued findings around\u000a      motivations for adaptation actions by householders, reporting they offer\u000a      insights to DCLG into behavioural issues (S4). Similarly, DEFRA's Head\u000a        of Buildings and Infrastructure Team reported that SNACC had\u000a      improved understanding of how to adapt suburbs, particularly highlighting\u000a      the risk of overheating, the range of effective solutions, the need for\u000a      local councils to work with community groups to build capacity, and how\u000a      adaptation has to be built into other policy interventions (S5). He\u000a      reports that the research helped develop the approach of the `Green\u000a        Infrastructure Partnership' in considering planting, shading and\u000a      external microclimate for cooling (S5).\u000a    Prior to the NAP's publication, SPE's research helped\u000a      inform a growing evidence base on adaptation that is now used across\u000a      Government and by industry. In response to growing concerns about\u000a      overheating from SNACC and others, DCLG commissioned an Investigation\u000a        into Overheating in Homes (S6) which cites SNACC as a source of\u000a      evidence (p 79, 80, 117,119). Concurrently, DEFRA was also keen that\u000a      practitioners had up-to-date evidence, so commissioned an industry guide:\u000a      Overheating in Homes: An Introduction for Planners, Designers and\u000a        Property Owners (S15). Williams provided evidence for\u000a      this guide and a paper (R3) and the SNACC Final Report (R5) are cited. The\u000a      guide is publicly available for practitioners (info@zerocarbonhub.org).\u000a    In 2012, SNACC's Final Report (R5) was launched in London by the Right\u000a        Honourable Don Foster, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and\u000a        Minister for Localism and Climate Change. In his speech he stated he\u000a      was: `surprised to hear such a strong emphasis on overheating as a climate\u000a      change issue', and concluded that `[t]his is an important report from\u000a      which government is already learning. Central Government has a role, and I\u000a      will make sure that the SNACC findings are taken on board as Government\u000a      develops the National Adaptation Plan' (S8).\u000a    Impact on the implementation of `the Green Deal'\u000a      The Green Deal is a scheme launched by DECC to enable householders and\u000a      businesses to make energy-saving improvements without having to pay all\u000a      the costs up front. It targets 14 million homes that could benefit from\u000a      such improvements and will bring large numbers of new players into the\u000a      energy efficiency market as authorised Green Deal assessors, providers and\u000a      installers. Between January and September 2013, 71,000 Green Deal\u000a      assessments had been completed.\u000a    SNACC, along with other ARCC projects (CREW, LUCID, see\u000a      www.arcc-cn.org.uk) produced research findings that indicated that some\u000a      Green Deal measures could create problems with overheating. Williams\u000a      (and Gupta) worked closely with ARCC-CN and DCLG, DECC and DEFRA\u000a      to provide accurate guidance, summarised in Synthesised Advice on\u000a        Identifying and Preventing Overheating in Homes under the Green Deal\u000a      (S9). This resulted in DECC issuing guidance to Green Deal suppliers to\u000a      ensure energy efficiency measures are installed correctly so that\u000a      overheating is not a common problem. In addition, DECC is now working to\u000a      ensure that energy efficiency supply chains, including those working\u000a      within Green Deal, are aware of overheating risk, and that guidance is\u000a      provided on homes which are most likely to be vulnerable, and the measures\u000a      that could be taken to minimise risk. These changes mean that Green Deal\u000a      should result in effectively adapted, comfortable homes, avoiding\u000a      significant overheating problems. \u000a    The research on overheating and Green Deal from the ARCC projects\u000a      received media attention during the warm summer of 2013. BBC News\u000a      reported: `Green Deal could lead to deadly summer overheating', which was\u000a      followed by a similar article in The Daily Mail (both citing the ARCC-CN\u000a      advice) (S9). Coverage led to commentaries on numerous housing,\u000a      environmental and climate websites, as well as from professional\u000a      institutions (e.g. RICS), raising public and practitioner awareness about\u000a      the UK's preparedness for climate change.\u000a    Impact on local responses to climate change adaptation in suburbs\u000a      SPE's research has assisted local level strategies for\u000a      suburban adaptation. As an example, the SNACC team has worked closely with\u000a      Bristol City Council to develop jointly our understanding of local risks\u000a      and strategies. The research has informed the Council's Sustainability\u000a      Advisor and her team who have used SNACC's findings to provide the\u000a      evidence base for assessing some climate risks in the city, but also to\u000a      feed into strategic planning policy, community resilience, neighbourhood\u000a      planning, asset management, protection of vulnerable people, and the\u000a      City's own retrofitting programme (S10). SNACC has also\u000a      provided case studies of `successful adaptation' which are now used by\u000a      local authorities (via London Climate Partnership), Sustainability West\u000a      Midlands, and across Europe (via CIRCLE-2, a database of climate\u000a      adaptation projects).\u000a    Overall, SPE's research has had a significant impact on\u000a      international, national and local policy and practice responses to the\u000a      very pressing issue of how best to adapt and plan neighbourhoods and\u000a      suburbs in response to future climatic conditions.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The majority of people in developed countries live in neighbourhoods\u000a      characterised as `suburban'. Yet, suburbs in their current form are\u000a      unsustainable: they contribute to, and are at risk from, climate change.\u000a      UWE's research on how suburbs can become more sustainable has been used by\u000a      international agencies, Governments and local authorities to develop\u000a      policies, and to identify and tackle climate risks. It has informed the\u000a      OECD's stance on suburbs within urban intensification policies. It has\u000a      helped shape the National Adaptation Programme for England, and improved\u000a      UK Government's ministers' and departments' (CLG, DEFRA, DECC)\u000a      understanding of climate risks. UWE's research has modified the delivery\u000a      of the Government's flagship energy efficiency Programme: Green Deal,\u000a      which retrofits dwellings for energy efficiency, to ensure that its\u000a      implementation does not result in homes overheating. It has also\u000a      benefitted local authorities, helping them plan effectively for climate\u000a      change.

It has\u000a      concentrated on how suburbs can contribute to sustainable cities, but also\u000a      be adapted (climate proofed) in the face of inevitable climate change. The\u000a      research has been funded by EPSRC under the Sustainable Urban\u000a        Environments (SUE) and Adaptation and Resilience to a Changing\u000a        Climate (ARCC) Programmes.\u000a    Compact city policies, often encompassed in `Smart' or `Green' Growth\u000a      strategies, are now central to spatial policies in most developed\u000a      counties, and are advocated by OECD, World Bank and the EU. However, the\u000a      theory behind these policies problematises suburbs as resource-rich places\u000a      lacking in cultural and social value. Hence the policy response is usually\u000a      either to intensify suburbs, making them more `urban', or to exclude them.\u000a    Williams has built the case that instead of vilifying suburbs,\u000a      urban policy makers should view them as part of the solution to\u000a      sustainable cities (R1). In particular, changes in climate mean that we\u000a      will need suburbs to provide desirable places for people to live\u000a      sustainably, and space for green and blue (water) infrastructure, with\u000a      benefits for food growing, autonomous forms of energy production, cooling,\u000a      and surface water management (R1,2). Importantly, this means that existing\u000a      suburbs will need development strategies that adapt them to reduce\u000a      emissions and cope with inevitable climate change, most notably heat\u000a      stress and flooding. In England, 22 million homes are in neighbourhoods\u000a      categorised as `suburban', so this is a major national challenge (R2,3,4).\u000a    The Neighbourhood Design and Sustainable Lifestyles project\u000a      (funded under SUE) (Williams PI), studied 13\u000a      `sustainable' developments in England and showed that new neighbourhoods can,\u000a      if designed well, provide the setting for sustainable lifestyles and land\u000a      uses. If a range of sustainable design features are included, then people\u000a      can be supported to make sustainable travel choices and engage in\u000a      activities that develop social capital (R4,5).\u000a    The Suburban Neighbourhood Adaptation for a Changing Climate (SNACC)\u000a        project (funded under ARCC) (Williams, PI) provided\u000a      new evidence on the `best' ways of adapting the UK's suburbs so they are\u000a      resilient to climate change, and liveable (R3). The project developed\u000a      conclusions with policy and practice relevance, namely:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aChanges to the physical environment of suburbs must encompass\u000a          adaptation and mitigation together, not separately, as has been\u000a        the case in England. We must also consider all potential climate\u000a        risks simultaneously, not retrofit for one threat.\u000a      \u000aOverheating is a much bigger problem in the UK than previously\u000a          thought. Modelling and further analysis of the different\u000a        types of suburb, undertaken collaboratively by UWE and OBU (Prof.\u000a          Gupta) demonstrated that in many suburbs 100% of homes will\u000a        overheat by 2050. In England 2,000 people died prematurely in the 2007\u000a        heat wave. Projections are for a 3-fold increase in heat deaths by 2050,\u000a        14 million lost working days, and increased hospital admissions. Yet\u000a        SNACC showed that many energy efficiency measures being promoted by\u000a        Government, NGOs and industry, such as additional insulation, could increase\u000a        these risks.\u000a      \u000aMany adaptations have multiple benefits, are effective, acceptable\u000a          and feasible: e.g. shading and a micro-climate tailored approach\u000a        (trees, greenery) are effective in neighbourhood cooling; sustainable\u000a        urban drainage systems are effective in preventing much flooding, but\u000a        rarely considered in existing suburbs.\u000a      \u000aPromotional campaigns and incentive schemes to encourage\u000a          householders to make changes to their homes should not focus on\u000a          climate change or risk: people are more motivated by saving money,\u000a        changing the image of their home and essential maintenance. Schemes\u000a        should also be targeted at key times: (e.g. during house\u000a        moves\/improvements), and by key agents, like estate agents,\u000a        providers of DIY products, and builders.\u000a      \u000aInstitutional responses (from local authorities, utilities, NGOs)\u000a          are most effective when they build on existing capacity, and link\u000a        to other policy agendas, such as fuel poverty, `greening', and carbon\u000a        reduction (R2,3,6).\u000a    \u000a    Key research staff: Katie Williams, Professor of Spatial\u000a      Planning, 01\/09\/07 - date; Ian Smith, RF, 03\/08\/98 - date; Robin\u000a        Hambleton, Professor of City Leadership, 01\/09\/07 - date; Jennifer\u000a        Joynt, RF, 28\/01\/09 - 31\/08\/12; Diane Hopkins, RF, 14\/03\/11\u000a      - 30\/11\/12.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40789","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    CPRC has had an impact on supply chain collaboration,\u000a      process improvement, and technology integration in the construction\u000a      industry, primarily in the South West of England, but also nationally and\u000a      internationally. It has achieved significant changes in the construction\u000a      industry's culture by disseminating its research through numerous means:\u000a      at a `macro' scale, through major knowledge exchange activities and at a\u000a      `micro' level through working with individual businesses and engaging in\u000a      KTPs. It is worth briefly describing the formal KE vehicles for the\u000a      Centre's research, to demonstrate the scale and intensity of activity.\u000a    On the strength of CPRC's research track record and\u000a      reputation it was, in 2004, invited to act as the regional hub for the two\u000a      initiatives designed to bring about the required changes in the\u000a      construction industry: Construction Knowledge Exchange (CKE) and Constructing\u000a        Excellence South West (CESW). CKE was funded by the Higher\u000a      Education Funding Council for England (&#163;383k, to 2009); CESW was\u000a      funded by the South West Regional Development Agency and Department for\u000a      Trade and Industry (&#163;1.1M, to 2012). In 2009, CPRC also\u000a      began to champion Future Foundations, a partnership of regional\u000a      and sub-regional stakeholders to promote sustainable construction. In\u000a      2010, UWE secured the Environmental iNet (note: Olomolaiye\u000a      is CPRC lead, and was instrumental in the development of\u000a      West Midlands Centre for Constructing Excellence) funded by the South West\u000a      of England Regional Development Agency and the European Regional\u000a      Development Fund (&#163;1.07M to 2013), with an ERDF-funded extension to 2015\u000a      (&#163;350k). The iNet is an initiative to support environmental goods\u000a      and services businesses in the Region, and has already assisted over 100\u000a      SMEs in the construction industry.\u000a    The remit of these KE initiatives is wider than that of CPRC's\u000a      research (including, for example health and safety issues). However, the\u000a      key foci are improving collaboration and streamlining processes, which has\u000a      meant that CPRC has influenced the overall message and\u000a      culture of these programmes and disseminated its research to considerable\u000a      effect.\u000a    At international and national levels CPRC, through\u000a      its various initiatives, has channelled the combined voice of the sector\u000a      in the region, acting as the `melting pot' for best practice (S1, p.3,\u000a      1.7) and industry champion for `Rethinking Construction'. It has had an\u000a      impact through its participation in the National Board of Constructing\u000a      Excellence, affecting policy formulation and implementation through its\u000a      advice to the international Sustainable Construction and Innovation\u000a      through Procurement (SCI)-Network. In addition, Jones' work on\u000a      collaboration partnerships was the basis of recommendations to the\u000a      `Construction Reform Movement' and led to the development of `Construction\u000a      Best Practice Clubs' (CBPCs &#8212; comprised practitioners) across the UK.\u000a      These clubs became one of the main KE vehicles for `Constructing\u000a      Excellence'. Meng's and Vidalakis' findings were also\u000a      built into the Constructing Excellence National Demonstration Programme.\u000a    At the regional scale, Meng, Vidalakis, Sun and Olomolaiye's\u000a      research findings were fed into local networks, training initiatives,\u000a      business assists, films, online information portals and other means of\u000a      communication appropriate for industry (e.g. S2). Through CESW and CKE CPRC\u000a      delivered workshops and provided training to 1700 individuals and\u000a      supported 778 businesses. It carried out specific assistance to 400\u000a      construction related businesses, in the form of consultancies and in-depth\u000a\u0009  organisational assists, which are largely productivity and\u000a      effectiveness reviews. Approximately 20% of these companies have national\u000a      and international projects, so have a reach wider than the South West. The\u000a      Centre has also led a network of seven CBPCs, helping over 30 local\u000a      companies to adopt best practice and enabling the development of a `same\u000a      team' culture amongst stakeholders.\u000a    An independent review of the CPRC-hosted CESW initiative,\u000a      based on a survey of participants (large firms, sub contractors,\u000a      professional service firms and public sector organisations), (S1) found\u000a      that it had led to:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aincreased levels of confidence in the Region's prospects for growth\u000a        by supporting the development of a stronger and more professional\u000a        industry through strengthening supply chains, improving its image and\u000a        developing local networks (S1, p.6);\u000a      \u000aa positive impact on the behaviour and processes employed within\u000a          construction firms: 75% of respondents reported better working\u000a        practices and processes (S1, p.6);\u000a      \u000aimproved awareness and understanding, and practical experience of\u000a          supply chain integration: 62% of respondents (S1, p.43);\u000a      \u000aimproved awareness and understanding, and practical experience of\u000a          collaboration with other firms\/organisations: 71% of respondents\u000a        (S1, p.43);\u000a      \u000amodernised working practices and processes: 67% of respondents\u000a        (S1, p.49); and\u000a      \u000aincreased profitability: 51% of respondents (S1, p.49).\u000a    \u000a    Since this review, these impacts have continued, with partners reporting\u000a      that the CRPC\/CESW collaboration has: `achieved remarkable\u000a      levels of supply chain integration and collaboration'; and `up-skilled our\u000a      supply chain and provided essential support to SMEs' (S3). Bristol City\u000a      Council reports that the collaboration resulted in its award of `Client of\u000a      the Year' at the South West Built Environment Awards, 2011 (S3). CESW's\u000a      Director testifies that CPRC's input was `substantial and\u000a      critical in supporting us to achieve better supply chain integration (and)\u000a      improved project and management performance.... Allowing the industry to\u000a      access best practice and innovative approaches to construction\u000a      procurement' (S4). The iNet has subsequently provided a similar\u000a      platform for companies in the region: 100 construction SMEs have\u000a      benefitted from 1700 hours of support in workshops or bespoke engagement.\u000a      Partners have reported the development of `a collaborative culture with\u000a      businesses and local authorities', and have benefited from `access to, and\u000a      use of, quality research undertaken by the University' (S5).\u000a    At the micro scale, CPRC has improved construction\u000a        processes and helped firms integrate IT solutions. The Centre's KTP\u000a      with Waycon Precast Ltd. on the reduction of waste in the production of\u000a      precast concrete elements led to: savings on outside contractors [text\u000a      removed for publication]; increased efficiency [text removed for\u000a      publication]; reduction in errors [text removed for publication]; and\u000a      capacity to expand in new business areas [text removed for publication]\u000a      (S6).

The Centre undertook research to understand and promote best\u000a      practice approaches in dealing with the endemic challenges facing the\u000a      industry, through supply chain collaboration, process improvement and\u000a      technology integration. Its research has been carried out in a continually\u000a      evolving (and mutually reinforcing) series of fundamental research\u000a      projects and action research partnerships (with industry stakeholders). CPRC\u000a      has worked with construction practitioners to identify problems, develop\u000a      theory, and produce and test practical solutions and tools. The research\u000a      was started by Martyn Jones, then led by Prof Ming Sun and\u000a      is now headed by Prof Paul Olomolaiye. Three other CPRC\u000a      academics were centrally involved in this research from the early 2000s\u000a      (see dates below), along with a number of external collaborators (as named\u000a      on publications).\u000a    A key focus of CPRC's research since 1998 was fragmentation\u000a        and adversarial attitudes within the industry (i.e. problems in supply\u000a        chain relationships and operations), identified in the `Egan\u000a        Report' as the source of the majority of the problems facing the\u000a      sector. Jones conducted some of the first studies analysing\u000a      partnering, and assessing progress towards the adoption of a collaborative\u000a      culture in the construction industry (R1,2). Based on surveys of\u000a      construction practitioners, he found they have some knowledge of supply\u000a      chain management, but require a better conceptual understanding and more\u000a      systematic approaches to change an essentially adversarial culture to a\u000a      more collaborative one. His research on the delivery of social housing\u000a      (funded by The Housing Corporation) resulted in a seven step model for\u000a      developing new supply chain relationships, and guidance on how best to\u000a      manage their sustainability (R2). In numerous publications, Jones\u000a      focused on encouraging clients and main contractors to rethink their\u000a      procurement strategies and adopt a best practice partnering approach. Jones'\u000a      research has been widely used to advance knowledge and\/or good practice in\u000a      partnering (e.g. R1 has 161 citations, in academic and industry\u000a      publications from the UK, Hong Kong, Sweden, Australia and elsewhere).\u000a    Meng's and Vidalakis' research (supported by a UWE PhD\u000a      bursary and HEFCE) also studied problems in construction sector supply\u000a        chains. Vidalakis focused on the applicability of logistics\u000a      management in construction, and provided new understandings by studying\u000a      the logistical functions of builders' merchants (R3). Meng's\u000a      research on the development of supply chain relationships (with Sun\u000a      and others) resulted in assessment procedures to help construction\u000a      organisations to evaluate their existing associations and to identify key\u000a      areas for further relationship improvement (R4). Both Meng and Vidalakis\u000a      concluded with arguments for the adoption of more collaborative\u000a      approaches. In 2009, Olomolaiye joined CPRC, with a\u000a      track record of research and industry engagement in construction best\u000a      practice, undertaking research on the role of fostering deeper engagement\u000a      between industry and higher education in the construction sector, and on\u000a      sustainable assessment criteria for building materials (R5).\u000a    CPRC also focused on Egan's other prime concern:\u000a          process improvement and technology integration in construction.\u000a      Sun's EPSRC-funded research on managing change and dependency in\u000a      construction projects provided new knowledge on task dependencies, and the\u000a      strategies practitioners deploy to deal with uncertainty and change. A\u000a      follow on study (a PhD undertaken by Olawale, supervised by Sun)\u000a      included a survey of 250 companies that indentified key factors that\u000a      inhibit time and cost control during construction projects, including\u000a      design changes, risks\/uncertainties and non performance of sub-contractors\u000a      (R6). Olawale and Sun identified 90 mitigating measures\u000a      that can be used as a checklist to help project managers improve the\u000a      effectiveness of their projects, which will help to reduce delays, costs,\u000a      quality defects, client dissatisfaction and damage to the reputation of\u000a      the industry. Taking this knowledge further, Sun (again, funded by\u000a      EPSRC) developed a change-management toolkit which helps teams to\u000a      anticipate changes that may affect cost, time and quality, and to evaluate\u000a      their impacts on a project before implementation (R7). The toolkit can\u000a      minimize the negative impacts of necessary changes, and avoid unnecessary\u000a      ones. Based on this knowledge, Sun and others also worked on two\u000a      Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs). One, in collaboration with Waycon\u000a      Precast Ltd (a company that produces pre-case concrete lift shafts),\u000a      looked at process reengineering in the production of its precast concrete\u000a      elements in order to reduce waste and achieve efficiencies in the\u000a      production phase. The second, with Management Process Systems (MPS) Ltd (a\u000a      Cambridge- based company that delivers best practice, information and\u000a      knowledge management services to the construction industry through IT\u000a      services via the internet), incorporated CPRC's research to\u000a      develop an innovative cost\/value measurement methodology for its online\u000a      contract change management system, to improve contract management and\u000a      sustainable design.\u000a    Key staff: Martyn Jones, Principal lecturer, 01-01-77 - 31\/07\/12;\u000a\u0009Dr Christos Vidalakis, RA\/RF, 12\/11\/07 - 12\/08\/12; Dr\u000a        Xiannai Meng, PhD student, 1\/10\/05 - 19\/06\/08;, Prof Ming Sun,\u000a      01\/09\/02 - 31\/03\/12; Prof Paul Olomolaiye, 01\/11\/09 &#8212; date; Dr\u000a        Yakubu Olawale, PhD student 01\/10\/05-13\/07\/10.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41447","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The ADePT method attracted widespread interest from its launch at the\u000d\u000a      Institution of Civil\u000d\u000a      Engineers in 1999, with 130 senior industrialists attending an evening\u000d\u000a      meeting to learn about `An\u000d\u000a      Innovative Approach to Design Management'. This coincided with an industry\u000d\u000a      awaking to the\u000d\u000a      challenge of design management and ADePT won the DETR Quality in\u000d\u000a      Construction innovation\u000d\u000a      award with AMEC. Such was the response that Professor Austin and four of\u000d\u000a      his ex-researchers\u000d\u000a      (Andrew Newton, Paul Waskett, John Steele and Jamie Hammond) set up a\u000d\u000a      university spin-out\u000d\u000a      company Adept Management Ltd (AML) in 2001 largely with `Business Angel'\u000d\u000a      funding and personal\u000d\u000a      investment.

The following four impacts of the underpinning\u000d\u000a      research have occurred in the\u000d\u000a      REF period.\u000d\u000a    1. Sustainable spin-out company\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research [R1-R6] has contributed directly to the\u000d\u000a      growth of Adept Management\u000d\u000a      Ltd [www.adeptmanagement.com,\u000d\u000a      C1]. The knowhow and IP (patent and process models) together\u000d\u000a      with staffing by Simon Austin and his four ex-researchers have created a\u000d\u000a      sustained business\u000d\u000a      success (despite the global economic downturn) generating &#163;6.75 million in\u000d\u000a      turnover (2008-2012)\u000d\u000a      [C2] with 10 employees; the ADePT approach remains at the heart of\u000d\u000a      the company's business\u000d\u000a      model [C3], as do the four ex-researchers who have remained at the\u000d\u000a      helm of the company.\u000d\u000a    Reach and significance are evidenced by ADePT being adopted by many top\u000d\u000a      companies [C4] in\u000d\u000a      the construction sector (e.g. seven of the contractors rated the UK's top\u000d\u000a      10 by turnover in the\u000d\u000a      annual league table published by Building Magazine in July 2012),\u000d\u000a      including Balfour Beatty,\u000d\u000a      Skanska and Carillion [C5]. One Head of Design described how: \"We\u000d\u000a        have been so impressed\u000d\u000a        with the methodology, we have bought software licenses and are training\u000d\u000a        design managers\/co-\u000d\u000a        ordinators to manage the process in-house\". The technique has also\u000d\u000a      been adopted by design and\u000d\u000a      project management consultancies (e.g. Arup, Atkins, Capita Symonds,\u000d\u000a      Ryder) and property\u000d\u000a      developers (e.g. Westfield, Dart Realty Ltd). The construction sectors\u000d\u000a      impacted include healthcare,\u000d\u000a      education, commercial offices, residential, highways, bridges, rail and\u000d\u000a      energy [C6].\u000d\u000a    The reach has extended beyond construction to other sectors such as\u000d\u000a      manufacturing, ship building\u000d\u000a      and aerospace, including organisations such as Dart, BAE Systems,\u000d\u000a      Rolls-Royce and Boeing. The\u000d\u000a      significance is underlined by ADePT winning a BAE Chairman's award in 2010\u000d\u000a      for shipbuilding\u000d\u000a      work (on the Type 26 frigate). Since, 2008 ADePT has been used on 94\u000d\u000a      commissions (60\u000d\u000a      individual projects), 81 of which were from repeat customers. For\u000d\u000a      instance, Skanska has used\u000d\u000a      ADePT on eleven occasions, John Sisk, ten times and Costain, nine times.\u000d\u000a      As one client explained\u000d\u000a      \"A recommendation was given that ADePT should be used on all future\u000d\u000a        suitable projects, both in\u000d\u000a        the pre-tender stage and also during the project itself\" [C6].\u000d\u000a    2. New technology business and products\u000d\u000a    Adept Management has invested over &#163;1.1 million to develop the ADePT\u000d\u000a      Design Software Suite,\u000d\u000a      launched in 2008. In doing so, it made the transition from a service\u000d\u000a      provider to also a technology\u000d\u000a      provider. By becoming partners of Microsoft and Oracle, the `Builder'\u000d\u000a      software interfaces directly\u000d\u000a      with conventional scheduling software used globally for project management\u000d\u000a      and specifically\u000d\u000a      construction\/manufacturing phase planning, enabling integrated design and\u000d\u000a      construction planning,\u000d\u000a      as conceived by the research [R2]. The `Manager' software\u000d\u000a      encapsulates the planning and control\u000d\u000a      functions first described as DePlan [R5], critical to maximising\u000d\u000a      the benefits of the method. Sales of\u000d\u000a      software licences (including support and training) totalling &#163;540,000 [C2]\u000d\u000a      have been made,\u000d\u000a      including non-construction businesses such as Boeing and BAE Systems.\u000d\u000a      Adept Management also\u000d\u000a      delivered bespoke training courses on the ADePT approach to companies such\u000d\u000a      as Balfour Beatty,\u000d\u000a      Morgan Sindall, Kier, BAE Systems, CDM Smith in Boston MA, RQ Construction\u000d\u000a      in San Diego,\u000d\u000a      BNIM architects in Kansas City and the Westfield Group [C3].\u000d\u000a    3. US Office and international clients\u000d\u000a    Adept Management established an office in California in 2009 (trading as\u000d\u000a      AML Technologies) to\u000d\u000a      expand into the lucrative North American market. ADePT has been used on\u000d\u000a      &#163;11 billion worth of\u000d\u000a      projects since 2008, in countries including the UK, US, Australia, Cayman\u000d\u000a      Islands, Sweden,\u000d\u000a      Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco (evidencing\u000d\u000a      reach).

This is often\u000d\u000a      overlooked when planning\u000d\u000a      design due to the lack of a method of analysis (hamstrung by all software\u000d\u000a      being based on the\u000d\u000a      Critical Path Method, which cannot deal with iteration). The potential\u000d\u000a      efficiency benefits are\u000d\u000a      significant given that design organisations typically estimate levels of\u000d\u000a      rework at 20-40%.\u000d\u000a    In response the academics, primarily assisted by PhD students Andrew\u000d\u000a      Newton and Paul Waskett,\u000d\u000a      developed ADePT, the Analytical Design Planning Technique,\u000d\u000a      a novel approach to mapping and\u000d\u000a      optimising iterative design processes, analogous to, but a fundamental\u000d\u000a      advancement upon, the\u000d\u000a      sequential critical path method.

Meanwhile, Lindsay's\u000a      contribution to Natural England's Upland Evidence Review [3] has informed\u000a      that body's policy development for the English uplands: as Natural\u000a      England's Head of Profession for Climate Change has acknowledged, the\u000a      Review set out evidence in an authoritative way on the controversial issue\u000a      of managed burning, influencing their advice to land managers, approach to\u000a      sites protected under law, delivery of agri-environment schemes and\u000a      management of their National Nature Reserves [d].\u000a    Lindsay was able to extend the reach of his impacts on policy makers'\u000a      awareness and understanding of issues relating to his research during a\u000a      two-month Visiting Professorship with the Graduate School of Agricultural\u000a      and Life Sciences at the University of Tokyo. In August 2011 he delivered\u000a      a major keynote speech to around 50 key researchers, agricultural\u000a      engineers and policy makers about the conflicts arising from agricultural\u000a      drainage of peatlands, carbon management, soil degradation and\u000a      biodiversity loss. This has stimulated an entirely new debate among\u000a      practitioners and policy makers about agricultural use of peatlands in\u000a      northern Japan [e].\u000a    Contributions to global biodiversity and climate change policies:\u000a      The impacts arising from Lindsay's research have been extended through his\u000a      work in relation to the Strategic Plan of the Convention on Biological\u000a      Diversity (CBD), a global agreement addressing all aspects of\u000a      biological diversity. In 2010, Lindsay was commissioned by the IUCN UK PP\u000a      to run a Defra-sponsored side event for contracting parties (government\u000a      delegations) and official partner NGOs at the 10th Conference\u000a      of Parities (COP10) of the CBD in Nagoya, Japan. Here, Lindsay set out the\u000a      need for increased conservation and wise use of peatlands to some 30 key\u000a      delegates from various governments and policy-making organisations.\u000a      Peatlands, and the importance of their carbon management, were\u000a      subsequently highlighted within of the Aichi Targets of the CBD Strategic\u000a      Plan for 2011-2020, which provide the overarching framework for the\u000a      development of global biodiversity policy. Contracting Parties, including\u000a      the UK Government, are now seeking to honour these new obligations by\u000a      developing programmes to achieve these new Aichi Targets [f].\u000a    Lindsay's work has provided valuable background for UK scientists who are\u000a      developing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidance\u000a      on peatland rewetting, helping the interpretation of the variety of carbon\u000a      metrics arising from peatlands which will enable agreed values that could\u000a      have huge benefits in securing carbon funding for peatland restoration.\u000a      The 2013 Wetland Supplement to the 2006 Kyoto Guidelines, approved by the\u000a      IPCC in October, specifically includes peatlands as part of the reporting\u000a      process for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories [g]. Meanwhile the\u000a      UK's Climate Change Committee has drawn on Lindsay's work to inform its\u000a      deliberations about the role of peatlands in relation to climate change in\u000a      the UK [h].\u000a    Contributions to the development of peatland carbon codes, UK and\u000a        Germany: Between 2012 and 2013 Lindsay contributed to the production\u000a      of the Defra-sponsored UK Peatland Carbon Code, intended to support\u000a      markets to pay for the restoration and re-wetting of degraded peatlands\u000a      across the UK. The development of such a Code was identified by Defra's\u000a      Ecosystem Markets Task Force and the UK Climate Change Committee as a key\u000a      priority for the UK Government. Lindsay is a co-author of the underpinning\u000a      Defra Research Report [4], and of the Code itself, which was launched by\u000a      the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Benyon, on 10th September 2013 [i].\u000a    In January 2013, Lindsay participated in a joint workshop in Berlin to\u000a      support the development of MoorFutures, a similar investment instrument\u000a      for climate and nature conservation set up in March 2011 by the Minister\u000a      of Agriculture and Environment of the German federal state of\u000a      Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania. The workshop, which involved more than 50\u000a      specialists from a range of EU countries, helped to clarify and strengthen\u000a      the science underpinning the UK and German Codes.\u000a    Contributions to windfarm and track debate, and influence on legal\u000a        cases: Lindsay's research and provision of specialist advice on\u000a      windfarm and related impacts, indicating the actual and potential damage\u000a      caused when windfarm or other access roads are constructed on peatland\u000a      ecosystems, has influenced the outcome of several legal cases. His 2004\u000a      report on the bogslide at Derrybrien, Co. Galway, was cited in 2008 by the\u000a      Irish High Court, finding in favour of the local community. It formed part\u000a      of the evidence to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by the European\u000a      Commission in its successful 2008 prosecution of the Irish Government [5].\u000a      All individual Derrybrien landowner compensation claims supported by\u000a      Lindsay's research have been successful in the Irish High Court [j].\u000a      His 2008 report on the very large windfarm proposed for the Isle of Lewis\u000a      [6] formed part of the RSPB's 2008 objection to the Scottish Minister, who\u000a      subsequently rejected the proposal. Lindsay's evidence for Natural England\u000a      in relation to a moorland track constructed illegally on peat led to a\u000a      successful landmark prosecution in the High Court [k].\u000a    Impacts on public awareness of and engagement with environmental\u000a        issues relating to peatlands: As the Chair of IUCN UK National\u000a      Committee has noted, `the apparent contradictions in the science\u000a      [previously] made it difficult to convey a compelling case for peatland\u000a      conservation and restoration'; Lindsay's work has helped overcome such\u000a      confusions [1]. His research has also underpinned &#8212; and improved\u000a      the accuracy of &#8212; popular media coverage of peatland-related issues. He\u000a      has drawn on it to contribute directly to coverage of windfarm development\u000a      in The Daily Mail (25 Feb 2013; average daily readership\u000a      4.25million), Sunday Telegraph (24 Feb 2013, 1.38million readers);\u000a      Telegraph (23 Feb 2013, 1.35million readers) and Yahoo News\u000a      (700million users per month). Lindsay has also been interviewed about his\u000a      peatland-carbon work by BBC Radio Farming Today (2010), BBC\u000a      Manchester Radio (2010), and National Geographic Radio (2008) [l].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at the University of East London has catalysed action across a\u000a      wide range of policy, science and practice activities aimed at restoring\u000a      and conserving peatlands.

In that role he conducted surveys and\u000a      assessments of peatlands throughout Britain and abroad. For 16 years, he\u000a      was also Chair of the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) &#8212; the\u000a      global network of peatland scientific advisors. Between 2008 and 2009\u000a      Lindsay was commissioned by RSPB Scotland to conduct a comprehensive\u000a      review of the literature on peatbogs and carbon to inform policy\u000a      development in oceanic peat bog conservation and restoration in the\u000a      context of climate change. The review, which was supported by funding from\u000a      Scottish Natural Heritage, Countryside Council for Wales, Natural England\u000a      and the Forestry Commission, explored the seemingly contradictory\u000a      scientific evidence relating to peatland carbon flux and management. To\u000a      the reviewed literature, Lindsay added ecological information and\u000a      understanding based on his own experience; he also conducted aerial-photo\u000a      interpretation and field surveys to clarify key issues. In many cases,\u000a      Lindsay found that a misunderstanding by original authors of the\u000a      ecological condition of the site under investigation had led to incorrect\u000a      interpretations of results, and hence to the apparent contradictions in\u000a      the existing literature. His final report, released in June 2010,\u000a      highlighted the major climate-change benefits of work to protect and\u000a      restore peatbogs in the UK [1].\u000a    Follow-on research funding was provided by the International Union for\u000a      the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) UK Peatland Programme to support further\u000a      and more detailed investigation by Lindsay of topics such as drainage\u000a      effects, burning impacts and ecosystem services. As part of this\u000a      commissioned research, Lindsay assessed material presented to the IUCN's\u000a      2011 Commission of Inquiry into Peatlands, and co-authored the final IUCN\u000a      Report on that Commission [2]. In June 2012, he was commissioned to take\u000a      part in Natural England's Upland Evidence Review, which addressed managed\u000a      burning, one of the most widely-practiced forms of land use in the English\u000a      uplands [3]. In 2012 Lindsay was invited to assist in the development of a\u000a      Defra-sponsored Peatland Code, designed to develop funding streams for\u000a      peatland restoration financed through Corporate Social Responsibility\u000a      (CSR) mechanisms. Lindsay was a co-author of the Code, which was launched\u000a      by the Environment Minister in September 2013 [4].\u000a    In 2004 Lindsay and Dr Olivia Bragg (University of Dundee) were\u000a      commissioned by Derrybrien Residents' Co-operative (a local community), to\u000a      undertake an assessment of, and produce a report about, a major bogslide\u000a      associated with windfarm construction at Derrybrien, Co. Galway. This\u000a      report considered the probable causes of the slope failure and the\u000a      consequences (both potential and actual) of the bogslide, including its\u000a      impacts on carbon stores. On the basis of this work, Lindsay was\u000a      commissioned to undertake a number of subsequent surveys in 2008-9 and\u000a      submit several Expert Witness Reports to the High Court in Galway in\u000a      support of compensation claims being made by the local residents [5]. This\u000a      led to Lindsay being commissioned to analyse, firstly, a large windfarm\u000a      proposal for the Isle of Lewis, Outer Hebrides, and, secondly, suspected\u000a      illegal moorland track construction in the north of England.

Over 50 staff\u000d\u000a        from local authorities and professional practice attended as part of\u000d\u000a        their Continued Professional Development (CPD).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Types of Impact\u000d\u000a    Impact on policy and planning: Research on spatial analysis and\u000d\u000a      modelling has influenced sections of Glasgow City Council's (GCC) City\u000d\u000a      Plans and housing policies (Sources A and B) between 2009-10. A strategic\u000d\u000a      partnership with Glasgow City Council was established to develop\u000d\u000a      strategies for key areas in Glasgow. Modelling of the centrality of public\u000d\u000a      open spaces monitors and predicts public usage and behaviour in space, and\u000d\u000a      was used to target investment in urban renewal. In reference to the\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde research, The Head of Planning and Building Control, Glasgow\u000d\u000a      City Council, has commented, \"Glasgow City Council values the\u000d\u000a        opportunity of applying the latest and most valuable research in the\u000d\u000a        development of its policies\". (Source C)\u000d\u000a    Scottish Government has used the research in urban morphology for\u000d\u000a      sustainable development and assessment of the vitality of small Scottish\u000d\u000a      towns. Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and private\u000d\u000a      practice have used the Urban Design Studies Unit's user engagement\u000d\u000a      approach to assess the potential for development of sites of strategic\u000d\u000a      importance to the city and its surroundings. Recent large scale\u000d\u000a      developments such as Tornagrain (around 4,000 new homes), Knockroon\u000d\u000a      (around 750 new homes) and Chapelton (around 8,000 new homes) have used\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde's master-planning techniques. Furthermore, the Plot-Based\u000d\u000a      Urbanism approach to master-planning has been used as a development model\u000d\u000a      by architectural practice and policy-makers and supported by many small\u000d\u000a      consultancy commissions, for example:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Research on street centrality along the Glasgow Riverfront, through\u000d\u000a        simulation of redistribution of public infrastructure and retail was\u000d\u000a        used in the Govan Local Development Strategy (part of City Plan\u000d\u000a        2 Source B).\u000d\u000a      Research on the East End of Glasgow sponsored by GCC, a local\u000d\u000a        developer and a local trust, disseminated through public exhibitions,\u000d\u000a        public debates and local newspapers was instrumental for the Barras\u000d\u000a          and Calton Local Development Framework, part of City Plan 2\u000d\u000a        (Source B), which has been granted funding by GCC for the regeneration\u000d\u000a        of the area and was used as guidance in the Calton Town Centre\u000d\u000a          Strategy (2010-11).\u000d\u000a      Research on the future of the M8 motorway in Glasgow and its impact on\u000d\u000a        accessibility of surrounding areas (e.g. Sighthill), commissioned by GCC\u000d\u000a        and GHA, and is now used in the Sighthill Access Design Statement\u000d\u000a        and Sighthill Transformation Area (Source D).\u000d\u000a      Research on Cumnock growth scenarios is used by East Ayrshire Council\u000d\u000a        in the Main Issues Report and informs the forthcoming East\u000d\u000a          Ayrshire Local Plan (2013). The Development Planning and\u000d\u000a        Regeneration Manager, East Ayrshire Council confirms that \"The\u000d\u000a          Planning and Economic Development service has been able to utilise the\u000d\u000a          research work at Strathclyde, specifically the study of street\u000d\u000a          centrality and the use of innovative approaches to master planning, in\u000d\u000a          the preparation of its Main Issues Report and replacement Local Plan\u000d\u000a          in relation to Cumnock\" (Source E).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Involvement of community groups and housing organisations in planning\u000d\u000a        decisions: The Strathclyde research was used to develop methods of\u000d\u000a      supporting community engagement and user participation in design, with the\u000d\u000a      intention of removing traditional barriers in communication between lay\u000d\u000a      people and `experts'. Commissioned by the Scottish Arts Council, a\u000d\u000a      step-by-step Handbook was produced to help local neighbourhood groups\u000d\u000a      develop scenarios, prioritise intervention, draft design requirements and\u000d\u000a      select professionals. This Handbook has been used since 2008 by Glasgow\u000d\u000a      Housing Association to generate consensus around design commissions, is\u000d\u000a      available online, and was updated in early 2013 with GHA. The Development\u000d\u000a      Manager, GHA has stated: The UDSU research [...] \"has provided an\u000d\u000a        essential resource of emerging techniques and academic rigour in the\u000d\u000a        activities of community engagement, master planning and urban analysis\u000d\u000a        to both the staff of GHA operating in the regeneration directorate, and\u000d\u000a        to the external consultants employed by it\" (Source F).\u000d\u000a    Development of resources to enhance professional practice:\u000d\u000a      Research by the Urban Design Studies Unit on the urban form of Scottish\u000d\u000a      small towns, in relation to economic and social factors, has been used to\u000d\u000a      develop policies in place-making, design and place assessment guidance,\u000d\u000a      and public consultation approaches. In 2010, Architecture + Design\u000d\u000a      Scotland (A+DS) set up a team with UDSU to formalise Plot Based Urbanism\u000d\u000a      into an adoptable planning approach for Scottish sustainable development\u000d\u000a      (2012-13). Since 2009, A+DS have commissioned studies from the UDSU\u000d\u000a      researchers on small Scottish towns, and recently commissioned an\u000d\u000a      assessment tool for housing developments, for forthcoming housing policy:\u000d\u000a      The Head of Urbanism, Architecture + Design Scotland confirms that \"The\u000d\u000a        University of Strathclyde material has been invaluable in shaping a\u000d\u000a        narrative to engage a series of stakeholders in making tangible a set of\u000d\u000a        propositions around change. In this context, the key impacts are policy\u000d\u000a        focused, which will direct investment and implementation\". (Source\u000d\u000a      G).\u000d\u000a    UDSU has developed a KTA collaborative project with one of the largest\u000d\u000a      urban design and architecture practices in the UK (Adam AU), which has a\u000d\u000a      large national and international portfolio of projects. AAU has been\u000d\u000a      critical in developing a commercially applicable `Multi Centrality\u000d\u000a      Assessment Platform' for planning which simulates and compares the\u000d\u000a      potential success of urban areas. This tool can influence planning and\u000d\u000a      optimise investment, attracting designers (to whom it adds financial\u000d\u000a      evidence to services), and clients (who reduce risk in committing\u000d\u000a      resources). The Director at AAU has commented: \"Adam Urbanism has\u000d\u000a        engaged with the University of Strathclyde Urban Design Unit with\u000d\u000a        research projects at different levels, from assisting with thesis\u000d\u000a        [projects] that are directly relevant to our work to joint working on\u000d\u000a        significant research projects\". And in reference to community\u000d\u000a      consultation and MCA: \"... It is impossible to give quantitative\u000d\u000a        figures ... Suffice to say that the considerable investment we have\u000d\u000a        given to the project is a reflection of the values of the expansion of\u000d\u000a        our knowledge base\" (Source H).\u000d\u000a    Provision of Training for Local authorities and the Scottish\u000d\u000a        Government: The close partnership with Glasgow City Council has also\u000d\u000a      involved training of council employees, so they can apply the research\u000d\u000a      methodology in practice. The educational model is strongly related to\u000d\u000a      research, and GCC staff have applied innovative approaches to space\u000d\u000a      assessment, modelling and urbanism since 2008 in Nitshill, Sighthill,\u000d\u000a      Calton and the Barras areas of Glasgow, the Forth and Clyde Canal, and\u000d\u000a      more recently Govan, where it is being applied to argue for the strategic\u000d\u000a      upgrade of Govan town-centre.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on urban planning has influenced planning decisions and assisted\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Government and Local Authorities to maximise economic,\u000d\u000a      physical and social factors in city visioning, planning and design. The\u000d\u000a      private sector has received advisory and design training in\u000d\u000a      master-planning though advanced spatial modelling principles and user\u000d\u000a      engagement techniques; local authority planners have also been trained.\u000d\u000a      The research has contributed to a paradigm shift in city planning towards\u000d\u000a      place-making and community design, not just in Scotland but\u000d\u000a      internationally. This agenda is now established as mainstream in city\u000d\u000a      planning, and Scotland is regarded as a reference to best practice as\u000d\u000a      witnessed by the wide adoption of planning documents such as Designing\u000d\u000a      Places, Designing Streets, and in recent large scale developments such as\u000d\u000a      Tornagrain (around 4,000 new homes), Knockroon (around 750 new homes) and\u000d\u000a      Chapelton (around 8,000 new homes), which have used Strathclyde's\u000d\u000a      master-planning techniques.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Strathclyde\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Strathclyde (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Strathclyde","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007805}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

This involves combining\u000d\u000a      information on urban densities, transport channels, physical form, and\u000d\u000a      services to achieve location efficiency. The Urban Design Studies Unit\u000d\u000a      (UDSU) within the Department of Architecture conducts research in spatial\u000d\u000a      analysis and modelling, threshold values and design principles to support\u000d\u000a      and optimise planning decisions. Research from 1998 - 2013 carried out by\u000d\u000a      key researchers in UDSU into sustainable urban planning, combines\u000d\u000a      different aspects of physical, socio- and economic planning\u000d\u000a    Key Findings\u000d\u000a    Research on urban analysis and sustainable design, threshold values and\u000d\u000a      ecological footprints of urban models (Frey, Romice and Porta) is part of\u000d\u000a      the EPSRC CityForm Consortium. This work highlights the impact of movement\u000d\u000a      trends, energy patterns, and suburban retrofitting, around a polycentric\u000d\u000a      network of robust district cores, interlinked by main transport hubs. The\u000d\u000a      research has led to a new approach to physical planning, Plot Based\u000d\u000a      Urbanism [1,2], joining data on urban densities, transport, physical form,\u000d\u000a      services and urban centralities monitored and optimised by identified\u000d\u000a      thresholds (Porta, Romice). Research in urban morphology identified\u000d\u000a      significant patterns in the evolution of small towns in Scotland, and\u000d\u000a      linked these to their capacity to evolve and adapt to changes in economic\u000d\u000a      and social conditions. It also showed recurrent patterns in the structural\u000d\u000a      layouts of urban form at different scales and over time [3]. Research in\u000d\u000a      spatial analysis and modelling (Porta, 2005-13) has demonstrated\u000d\u000a      correlations between urban centralities and urban forms, commercial\u000d\u000a      services and more recently, socio-\/health-related factors in cities [4].\u000d\u000a      Multiple Centrality Assessment (MCA) links street centrality and the\u000d\u000a      potential of urban areas to support development and maximise investment &#8212;\u000d\u000a      economic, social and environmental [5]. Whilst strongly encouraged by the\u000d\u000a      Government and now a compulsory feature of planning, user engagement in\u000d\u000a      design is still not effectively conducted. Based on the earlier research\u000d\u000a      findings detailed above UDSU developed and published a practical Handbook\u000d\u000a      with a multimodal approach to engage the public in decision-making in\u000d\u000a      urban regeneration, with a focus on neighbourhoods and management [6].\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers: The research was led by the following staff in\u000d\u000a      the Department of Architecture, University of Strathclyde: Sergio Porta,\u000d\u000a      Professor and director of The Urban Design Studies Unit (2009-2013);\u000d\u000a      Ombretta Romice, Senior Lecturer (2000-2013); H.

This\u000a      stands alongside the development of industry guidance notes and\u000a      consultation papers on lease pricing, directly impacting on professional\u000a      practice and industry change. This impact is long term, commenced before\u000a      the REF period and continues throughout this period.\u000a    Specifically, before the current REF period, the changing policy agenda\u000a      was directly related to the findings of the Code Monitoring reports [3:1\u000a      and 3:2]. Evidence includes specific mentions by Raynesford, Cooper and\u000a      Chancellor Brown in Ministerial Statements (2000, 2005) and the 2005\u000a      Budget Speech (http:\/\/webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/20100407010852\/http:\/\/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk\/d\/bud05_chap03_229.pdf\u000a      Para 3.119, Page 76).\u000a    New policy strands which emerged following identification within the\u000a      Reading research were dissemination of the Code and small business tenants\u000a      (a major theme of the current REF period), Code revisions and assignment\u000a      and sub-letting. The latter policy initiative led, a month after the\u000a      Ministerial Statement in 2005, to the British Property Federation\u000a      initiative, recommending members not to impose onerous alienation clauses\u000a      within existing leases, an initiative that has lasted throughout the REF\u000a      period. Industry funded research also impacted on the policy agenda. For\u000a      example, Reading contributed to the industry response to the 1993\u000a      Government consultation which resulted in Government opting for a\u000a      voluntary rather than a legislative solution and later research for the\u000a      RICS identified occupier concerns with the leasing environment. These\u000a      findings informed the research questions for the second Code Monitoring\u000a      Report [3:2].\u000a    REF period impact\u000a    Research continues to impact on self-regulation of the industry\u000a    In the present REF period the research programme continued to impact on\u000a      policy and industry change. First, \"research published by Reading\u000a        ...... went some considerable way in informing the members of the lease\u000a        code working group as to its task\" [5:5] of redrafting the current\u000a      Lease Code. It is still in place and a \"continuingly influential\u000a        guidance note to the property industry\" [5:1]. The findings of\u000a      Reading's 2009 report [3.5] on dissemination provided government with the\u000a      evidence to maintain pressure on the industry, so playing a clear and\u000a      continuing role on the government's approach to self-regulation of\u000a      commercial property leasing. This can be seen in the ministerial response\u000a      to the report: \"This [Reading] report about dissemination and use of\u000a        the 2007 Code paints a very disappointing picture. It suggests that\u000a        small business tenants are not receiving any substantive information on\u000a        the code from any source\" which led to the policy statement to call\u000a      on the property industry \" to redouble efforts to disseminate and use\u000a        the code\" and \"In particular, the professions-surveyors and\u000a        solicitors-have a special responsibility for making it available.\"\u000a      (http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm200809\/cmhansrd\/cm090703\/wmstext\/90703m0001.h\u000a        tm). It gave \"additional impetus to those involved in industry to\u000a        ensure that small business tenants have access to the advice they need\"\u000a      [5:5]. The Government response to the Portas review in 2012 illustrates\u000a      that the findings on dissemination continue to influence Government policy\u000a      on small business tenant awareness [5:5] and that the Government is aware\u000a      of the role played by the professional institutions, a role highlighted by\u000a      the findings of the 2009 Reading research report [3:5]. \"We are\u000a        currently working on various options for disseminating the Code,\u000a        targeting small businesses and landlords who could benefit most from the\u000a        guidance offered by the Code. We have written to key industry players\u000a        such as the British Property Federation, Royal Institute of Chartered\u000a        Surveyors and the Law Society, to urge greater promotion of the Code. We\u000a        are already discussing a dedicated awareness-raising event with the\u000a        British Property Federation and The Royal Institute of Chartered\u000a        Surveyors. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors will also\u000a        undertake a campaign to communicate the Code, and the need to abide by\u000a        it, to its 60,000 members.\"\u000a      (https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/7525\/2120019.pdf.)\u000a    Research is catalyst for new retail lease\u000a    A joint RICS and British Retail Consortium (BRC) new retail lease for\u000a      small businesses was launched in 2012. This lease is short, is written in\u000a      plain English and provides flexible terms for a lease of up to five years\u000a      with no rent review. It is to be read in conjunction with the current Code\u000a      for Leasing Business Premises. This lease is a direct result of the\u000a      government policy focus on small businesses in leasing, which came about\u000a      because of the Reading research findings in 2002 and 2005, reinforced by\u000a      the 2009 research findings on the vulnerability of small business tenants\u000a      in the leasing process. The Government (BIS) has linked this development\u000a      directly to the 2007 Code.\u000a      https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/new-lease-to-make-life-simpler-for-small-businesses).\u000a      The role of Reading research in that process is confirmed by the chair of\u000a      the BRC Property Advisory Group (It \"would not have happened without\u000a        the resultant debate and negotiation within the industry following the\u000a        publication of [Reading's] commercial lease research\") and the chair\u000a      of the working party which produced the standard lease stated that the\u000a      2009 Monitoring Report (3:5) helped \"to ensure that the form of lease\u000a        such tenants are expected to sign is more reasonable\" [5:5].\u000a    Commercial lease pricing and the treatment of leasing incentives\u000a    The third and fourth major REF period impacts arising from this extended\u000a      research programme are on commercial lease pricing. The PI, through\u000a      membership of the RICS Red Book editorial board and Property Valuation\u000a      Forum in the 1990s and, more latterly, in his current dual roles on the\u000a      RICS Valuation Standards Board and IPD Industry Consultative Committee,\u000a      has been at the centre of industry discussions surrounding leasing\u000a      incentives including their impact on rental valuation and on index\u000a      construction. First, having drafted the RICS VIP in 2006 on leasing\u000a      incentives, the content of the RICS VIP has remained the main guidance to\u000a      UK valuers throughout this REF period and has been upgraded into an RICS\u000a      Red Book Guidance Note. The Red Book and associated papers are the major\u000a      source of valuation guidance for all Chartered Surveyors operating in the\u000a      UK and overseas. Its practice statements are mandatory on all surveyors\u000a      [5:4].\u000a    Second, the PI identified issues with the application of the leasing\u000a      incentives at the 2000 IPD industry conference, (3:3), and, as stated by\u000a      the Founding Director of Investment Property Databank, has been \"heavily\u000a        involved along with us at IPD and the RICS in a 12 year debate\u000a        concerning the most appropriate industry response\" to these issues\u000a      [5:2]. This culminated in the IPF funded consultation paper [3:6] setting\u000a      out the solution to the identified problem. Following industry wide\u000a      circulation of the paper, written responses and a series of follow-up\u000a      seminars with the Reading research team, the changes to the indices have\u000a      been agreed. This agreement accepts the Reading format for new rental\u000a      value and equivalent yield series covering 21,000 commercial properties\u000a      worth &#163;140 billion. The claims for impact of the Reading research on this\u000a      process are supported by IPD, RICS [5:4] and IPF [5:3]. For example, \"Not\u000a        only have Crosby and Devaney identified and investigated the problems\u000a        .., they have also worked hard to identify the most pragmatic and\u000a        implementable solution\" [5:3].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken at Reading by Crosby\/Hughes\/Devaney and retirees\u000a      Murdoch\/Baum into commercial lease law, policy, practice and pricing since\u000a      1993 has driven Government policy and supported industry change within a\u000a      significantly altered leasing environment in the UK. During the REF\u000a      period, research conducted at Reading has continued to influence the\u000a      self-regulation of the industry, acted as a catalyst for a new retail\u000a      lease and significantly influenced industry solutions concerning aspects\u000a      of commercial lease pricing.

It is based on 3 Government and 4 industry funded projects and\u000a      has two strands running in parallel; policy and practice. Both strands\u000a      have informed each other.\u000a    The impetus for this research was the UK commercial property crash of\u000a      1989\/90. Up to this point the commercial leasing market was largely\u000a      unregulated, but the economic crisis led to a perception of market failure\u000a      within the leasing market and the clamour for government intervention from\u000a      tenants and their representative bodies. Specific problems were seen as\u000a      information asymmetry in the market (resulting in tenants being unable to\u000a      make informed decisions), a distortion of the normal market forces of\u000a      supply and demand at rent review, and a lack of transparency in the\u000a      market. In 1993, the UK Government consulted on legislating in the\u000a      specific areas of upward-only rent reviews, confidentiality clauses and\u000a      rent determination processes (DOE, 1993). Baum, Crosby and Murdoch were\u000a      asked to contribute to a response by major property owners (Association of\u000a      British Insurers and the Investment Property Forum (IPF)). The research\u000a      concluded that the UK commercial property market would suffer a 4% fall in\u000a      value if upwards-only rent reviews were banned in new leases. The outcome\u000a      of the consultation was the introduction of a voluntary Code of Practice\u000a      in 1996. The Reading research team was commissioned (through competitive\u000a      tender in 1997) by the UK government to monitor the operation of the first\u000a      Code and also successfully tendered on two further occasions in 2002 and\u000a      2008 to monitor later versions of the Code. On the first two occasions the\u000a      brief was to investigate the success of the first two editions of the Code\u000a      and to provide a critical analysis of the changing nature of the\u000a      commercial leasing market. The third commission was to investigate the\u000a      dissemination of the latest 2007 version of the Code. Research methods\u000a      included extensive reviews of the legal and property market context,\u000a      detailed quantitative analyses of changing lease terms and qualitative\u000a      research into the process by which this change was taking place. It also\u000a      included a critical evaluation of valuation methods for assessing both\u000a      rents and capital values. To accomplish this, the Reading team conducted\u000a      postal and interview surveys of landlords, tenants (and their advisors,\u000a      including letting agents and legal representatives) and lenders. They then\u000a      constructed and evaluated case studies of specific transactions and formed\u000a      and analysed large scale data sets of: the national and local economy;\u000a      national, regional and local property markets; and, most importantly,\u000a      Government and private data of commercial property lease terms [Outputs\u000a      3:1, 3:2, 3:4, 3:5].\u000a    This policy strand to the research identified major changes to the\u000a      leasing environment driven by a combination of market conditions and\u000a      response to Government pressure on the property industry to deliver a\u000a      changed leasing environment. Leases were found to be getting shorter and\u000a      more diverse although rent reviews were still almost always upwards-only.\u000a      The research revealed the terms that were of concern to tenants in\u000a      leasing, such as the ability to assign or sublet unwanted space. However,\u000a      both the first [3:1] and second reports [3:2] found that the Codes of\u000a      Practice were not well disseminated and therefore had little direct impact\u000a      on specific transactions, but that there were clear signs that the Codes\u000a      had long-term impacts on flexibility and choice within leasing markets.\u000a      They also revealed that small business tenants (SBT) lacked awareness of\u000a      property matters and often took leases on the first terms offered; usually\u000a      without taking professional property advice [3:1, 3:2, 3:4]\u000a    Dissemination to, and use of the Code by, SBTs became the main question\u000a      for the Reading team in their third Code monitoring research project. The\u000a      team found that the 3rd edition of the Code was not well\u000a      disseminated and was rarely used directly in negotiations except by a few\u000a      large tenants; SBTs were not often being informed of the existence of the\u000a      Code by their advisers [3:5]. Finally, the policy research programme\u000a      identified major issues with the ability of the market to price the more\u000a      diverse lease terms introduced by the changing leasing environment [e.g.\u000a      3:2].\u000a    Therefore, in parallel with the policy research programme, the Reading\u000a      team has also pursued this pricing research agenda in cooperation with the\u000a      property industry. Peer reviewed research published between 1998 and 2001\u000a      culminated in output [3:3] outlining one of the major pricing issues\u000a      identified above; the unreported variation in assumptions concerning\u000a      leasing incentives within rental value estimates. These estimates are a\u000a      basic input into all commercial property valuations and form the basis of\u000a      property market indices. Industry based research outputs from the\u000a      programme include lead authorship of the first draft of RICS valuation\u000a      information paper (VIP) on the analysis of lease transactions published in\u000a      2006 setting out suggested solutions to the valuation problems. Updated\u000a      versions now appear in the RICS Red Book as UK Guidance Note No.6. More\u000a      recently, also building off the findings of [3:3], [3:6] has been used as\u000a      the industry consultation paper for redesigning the rental value and\u000a      equivalent yield indices of IPD, the leading commercial property database\u000a      in the UK. This paper analysed the various valuation approaches for\u000a      assessing the value of leasing incentives and identified the process by\u000a      which they are transformed into rental value indices. The research method\u000a      included a quantitative analysis of the impact of the different inputs\u000a      into the valuation methods and a back-casting of past rental value and\u000a      incentives data to test the performance of the various possible\u000a      approaches. It concluded with recommendations for industry on the\u000a      preferred most practical solution for the generation of more accurate\u000a      indices of rent and yield within IPD.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42956","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has redefined best practice in visual contrast standards for\u000d\u000a      the regulation and design of urban environments and public transport\u000d\u000a      systems, thereby improving the way in which VIP interact with their\u000d\u000a      environment and making environments easier for VIP to navigate.

The Reading work developed a\u000d\u000a      measurable contrast difference between colours that can confidently be\u000d\u000a      identified by 80% of VIPs in the UK, and defined a new standard for how\u000d\u000a      this may be achieved.\u000d\u000a    These research findings are being used by a number of organisations,\u000d\u000a      including large manufacturing companies such as ICI Dulux, a variety of\u000d\u000a      charities, government departments, such as the Department for Transport,\u000d\u000a      and national and international bodies that set standards for buildings and\u000d\u000a      products.

The international standard ISO 23599\u000d\u000a      (related to assistive products for blind and vision-impaired persons, and\u000d\u000a      concerned with tactile surfaces) has adopted the Reading LRV approach.

This has proved to be unworkable so British representatives [on the\u000d\u000a        EN drafting committee] have used Reading's work to develop a Euro-Norm\u000d\u000a        that combines both techniques... Once in force, it will guide the\u000d\u000a        interpretation of the PRM TSI across the European Union.\" All new\u000d\u000a      regulated rail vehicles must now comply with the contrast requirements\u000d\u000a      defined at Reading. The Reading researchers were consulted in the drafting\u000d\u000a      of the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (RVAR). In 2008 the UK\u000d\u000a      government amended and updated the RVAR (S.I.1998\/2456) so that it draws\u000d\u000a      directly on the Reading work. A statement from DfT has commented that: \"The\u000d\u000a        Department [for Transport] has used the findings of Project Rainbow to\u000d\u000a        set out for transport providers how their vehicles and facilities can\u000d\u000a        achieve the contrast requirements required by law,\" and that \"Latest\u000d\u000a        statistics (November 2012) show that 71 per cent of buses in England now\u000d\u000a        fully meet accessibility requirements, including for contrast.\u000d\u000a        Meanwhile, 45 per cent of rail vehicles in Great Britain (over 7,600\u000d\u000a        carriages) meet their relevant standards\". The work has also been\u000d\u000a      used by DfT to craft requirements for train stations; see \"DfT Accessible\u000d\u000a      Train Station Design for Disabled People\" (2011), available at: http:\/\/bit.ly\/18nnOmZ.\u000d\u000a      This is in addition to existing DfT documents that include the Reading\u000d\u000a      work, such as \"Inclusive Mobility\"\u000d\u000a      (www.dft.gov.uk\/transportforyou\/access\/peti\/inclusivemobility).\u000d\u000a    The reach of this project is very wide, covering urban planning as well\u000d\u000a      as major elements of the transport sector, in particular relating to\u000d\u000a      public transport provision. Its impact is in the areas of quality of life\u000d\u000a      (including health and safety), as well as employment and manufacturing.\u000d\u000a      Whilst quality of life is difficult to measure, the Government's\u000d\u000a      Disability Equality Indicators cite ability to obtain employment as\u000d\u000a      important. The RNIB estimates that the indirect costs of not realising\u000d\u000a      employment opportunities for VIP is around &#163;1.6 billion. In addition,\u000d\u000a      employers are required to deal with current and potential employees\u000d\u000a      (including VIP) in a non-discriminatory way, and this Reading visual\u000d\u000a      contrast work is highly relevant for improving the employability of VIPs\u000d\u000a      as well as their safety in the workplace by providing the standards by\u000d\u000a      which this may be assessed. Manufacturers such as ICI Dulux and Gradus\u000d\u000a      have used the Reading work to develop a unique market position, enhance\u000d\u000a      their activities and tailor their products to meet clear LRV criteria.\u000d\u000a      Further evidence of impact can also be found in many new buildings\u000d\u000a      completed since 2004, including Heathrow Terminal 5 and the London\u000d\u000a      Olympics 2012 facilities.

Research performed in\u000d\u000a      Reading's School of Construction Management and Engineering has brought\u000d\u000a      significant improvements to the quality of life and safety of VIP by\u000d\u000a      developing a better measurement of their visual contrast sensitivity and\u000d\u000a      putting this measurement into practice. For someone with a visual\u000d\u000a      impairment, the ability to distinguish between different objects and\u000d\u000a      surfaces is crucial for assessing the surrounding environment and\u000d\u000a      navigating it accurately and safely. The research has defined a measurable\u000d\u000a      contrast difference (30 points on a 1-to-100 light reflectance value (LRV)\u000d\u000a      scale) between surfaces of any colour that can be confidently identified\u000d\u000a      by 80% of VIP in the UK. This new contrast standard offers a significant\u000d\u000a      breakthrough in understanding and simplifies the concept of LRV. It\u000d\u000a      provides designers and product manufacturers with a useful yardstick by\u000d\u000a      which urban environments and public transport systems can be made more\u000d\u000a      accessible and safer for VIP to use. The new definition has effectively\u000d\u000a      replaced the previously used concept of luminous reflectance in this arena\u000d\u000a      and is now in widespread use, thanks to the establishment of an\u000d\u000a      internationally recognised method of surface colour measurement (BS 8493)\u000d\u000a      in 2009 that draws on the Reading work.

This research arose against\u000d\u000a      that background, and was also informed by the work of CIB (International\u000d\u000a      Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction) Working\u000d\u000a      Group 84 (on non-handicapping environments, established in 1994). The lead\u000d\u000a      Reading researcher (Cook) and others in the School began discussions in\u000d\u000a      1994 with contacts in the charity sector, including at the Royal National\u000d\u000a      Institute for the Blind (RNIB), the Royal National Institute for Deaf\u000d\u000a      People (RNID) and the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association (GDBA), about\u000d\u000a      the role of research in improving accessibility. Discussions focused\u000d\u000a      around the potential to improve the built and transport environment for\u000d\u000a      VIP, who number around two million in the UK (compared to around 450,000\u000d\u000a      wheelchair users). In addition to the RNIB and the GDBA, ICI Dulux agreed\u000d\u000a      to engage in the research proposal to examine how colour and contrast\u000d\u000a      could help VIP when they interact with the built environment. This highly\u000d\u000a      successful collaboration resulted in the award of a two-year EPSRC Grant\u000d\u000a      (GR\/K51860\/01) in March 1995.\u000d\u000a    The research project had three distinct but related stages. The first\u000d\u000a      stage, completed in November 1995, involved obtaining information about\u000d\u000a      how and why VIP interact with, and navigate through, the built environment\u000d\u000a      and how they use public transport. This was achieved using a survey\u000d\u000a      distributed by the RNIB to 1500 VIP. Follow-up group interviews with 66\u000d\u000a      VIP were performed to understand why VIP make certain choices when\u000d\u000a      interacting with their environment. The second part of the project,\u000d\u000a      completed in October 1996, measured the `colour contrast perception' &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      ability to identify contrasting coloured surfaces as different &#8212; of a\u000d\u000a      representative sample of VIPs. Because of weaknesses in using conventional\u000d\u000a      vision registration classification criteria, two new test methods were\u000d\u000a      developed. One determined the field of vision of test subjects and the\u000d\u000a      other measured colour contrast perception. Both tests have relevance\u000d\u000a      beyond the built\/transport environments. A special visual display chamber\u000d\u000a      was constructed to display two standard samples to all 38 test subjects,\u000d\u000a      who were asked to identify a contrast difference between them and to give\u000d\u000a      their level of confidence in doing so. This generated a large data set\u000d\u000a      (over 10,000 observations) covering a large part of the colour spectrum\u000d\u000a      and enabled the researchers to identify a threshold for the confident\u000d\u000a      identification of contrast across a range of sample colours. A key finding\u000d\u000a      was that colour contrast is more consistently evident when considering the\u000d\u000a      value (light\/dark) element of a coloured surface, than the hue or chroma\u000d\u000a      (intensity) of the colour itself.\u000d\u000a    The third stage, completed in January 1997, examined the survey and test\u000d\u000a      results in a `real world' setting. A series of six rooms were decorated to\u000d\u000a      show a wide range of colours and different contrasts between elements and\u000d\u000a      components within them. Test subjects were a subset of those who had\u000d\u000a      undertaken the colour contrast perception test. They were asked to\u000d\u000a      identify the contrast differences between different surfaces and surface\u000d\u000a      components (e.g. doors built into walls) in these rooms.\u000d\u000a    Overall, the key finding of this study is that if two coloured surfaces\u000d\u000a      adjacent to one another have a contrast difference defined as a CIE\u000d\u000a      (International Commission on Illumination) `Y' difference of 30 points,\u000d\u000a      they would be identified as different surfaces by 80% of the\u000d\u000a      visually-impaired\/blind population of the UK. In 2008, this finding led to\u000d\u000a      the establishment of a new standard test (BS8493) for accurately measuring\u000d\u000a      the contrast between two different-coloured surfaces. This contrast was\u000d\u000a      formerly known as the CIE `Y' difference but is now named by the Reading\u000d\u000a      team as LRV. Today, the LRV contrast measurement is used by designers of\u000d\u000a      built environments and manufacturers of paints, carpets, vinyl flooring,\u000d\u000a      stair nosings, handrails, office furniture and a wide range of surface\u000d\u000a      finishes with a view to making products as useful to the spectrum of VIP\u000d\u000a      as possible.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42960","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Construction industry bases procurement approaches on research\u000a    The research has led to companies taking a new approach to procurement.\u000a      Examples of this are the cases of Provelio and Balfour Beatty. Since 2008\u000a      Provelio, a Project Management provider in Property and Construction, has\u000a      incorporated procurement decision models into their business practice,\u000a      which allow clients to \"rigorously understand what their best procurement\u000a      solution would be rather than rely on traditional advice. [Provelio's]\u000a      approach is based on Will Hughes' procurement framework that is reported\u000a      in [2]\" (section 5 [a]). Balfour Beatty has used the Reading research to\u000a      explore \"such issues as... transactional costs in the supply chain and the\u000a      need to take non value adding tiers out of the supply chain\" [b]\u000a    Research informs new British Standard for construction procurement\u000a    In 2006 the development of a new British Standard (BS) for construction\u000a      procurement was seen by policy makers as key to developing better\u000a      construction business practice. The idea of a new BS was supported by the\u000a      Constructing Excellence Procurement Task Group &#8212; a panel of practitioners,\u000a      including Hughes, concerned with the development of procurement practice\u000a      guidance. By 2008 the British Standards Institute (BSI) had established a\u000a      technical drafting committee for a new British Standard (BS) in\u000a      Construction Procurement; Hughes was an invited member of the committee\u000a      and other members were drawn from Constructing Excellence as well as the\u000a      major construction professional institutions, including the Royal\u000a      Institution of British Architects, Chartered Institute of Building and the\u000a      Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The research conducted at\u000a      Reading fed directly into the drafting of the new standards through\u000a      Hughes' involvement in the drafting committee [c].\u000a    Following a period of consultation with industry, the new BS on\u000a      construction procurement (BS 8534:2011, Construction procurement\u000a        policies, strategies and procedures &#8212; Code of practice) was\u000a      published in August 2011. It is designed to complement a number of\u000a      important international procurement standards (in particular ISO 10845,\u000a      Parts 1 and 2) that have been adopted into British Standards and deal with\u000a      procurement processes and documentation.\u000a    Unlike other procurement guidance which concentrates on procurement\u000a      processes and selection criteria, this code is novel in the way that it\u000a      concentrates on the development of procurement policies and strategies to\u000a      frame the selection and appointment of the design\/construction team.\u000a      Additionally, it sets the procurement process within the overall project\u000a      business case, and draws together and distils much of the available\u000a      construction procurement guidance into a usable and practical framework.\u000a    Construction industry and clients benefit from new Code of Practice\u000a    The Code of Practice published in 2011 is used by those responsible for\u000a      construction procurement in both the public and private sectors and\u000a      provides a benchmark of best practice that will help in the avoidance of\u000a      procurement disputes. Construction clients, in both the public and private\u000a      sector, and all sectors within the construction industry have benefitted\u000a      from this guidance as a result of more streamlined and effective\u000a      procurement processes leading to reduced costs borne by the supply chain\u000a      and improved procurement outcomes.\u000a    The reach of this project goes beyond UK construction. As a result of the\u000a      research, and the publication and profile of the BS 8534, Hughes has been\u000a      invited to participate in a number of influential industry and policy\u000a      bodies, including:\u000a    \u000a      Member of drafting committee for the BS Publicly Available\u000a        Specification (PAS) 98: Formation of consortia, 2009-10, which covers\u000a        consortia in the IT domain\u000a      Member of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)\u000a        Construction Industry Innovation and Growth Team (Major Projects),\u000a        2009-10 [d, Pg 218].\u000a    \u000a    The work has also had international impact. The Senior General Manager\u000a      for Japan Post Holdings noted \"specific examples where we have been\u000a        able to apply the lessons from this research [on] our major construction\u000a        projects are JP Tower (new Tokyo Post Office), Nagoya high-rise building\u000a        project, etc.\" [e].\u000a    Reading expertise shapes conclusions of major government enquiry\u000a    Hughes' findings on the potential for bid manipulation [2] led to his\u000a      involvement as a key member of the consultant team in a major government\u000a      enquiry by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The OFT issued a Statement of\u000a      Objections against 112 firms in the construction sector in England in\u000a      April 2008 following one of the largest ever Competition Act\u000a      investigations, which revealed illegal anti-competitive bid rigging\u000a      activities on 199 tenders between 2000 and 2006. Hughes' research was\u000a      cited multiple times in the OFT's Final Decision, which was published in\u000a      September 2009 [f] and affected building projects across England worth\u000a      more than &#163;200 million [g]. The Director of Europe Economics, also the\u000a      OFT's lead consultant on the enquiry, stated that Hughes \"provided\u000a        valuable insights into construction industry business models and helped\u000a        shape our conclusions\". This inquiry further strengthened the case\u000a      for best practice guidance in construction procurement [h].\u000a    Additional routes to impact\u000a    Hughes and his colleagues have disseminated their research findings\u000a      through numerous channels:\u000a    \u000a      Publication of results in the peer reviewed journals and in\u000a        textbooks\/collective volumes [1-6].\u000a      Raising awareness in the construction sector `trade' literature (e.g.\u000a        `Survey slams huge cost of tendering', Contract Journal, 21\u000a        February 2005)\u000a      Raising public awareness more generally (e.g. Hughes was involved in a\u000a        discussion on a BBC Radio 4 `File on Four' programme on construction, 10\u000a        and 15 July 2007)\u000a      Direct involvement in policy discussions and crafting guidance (e.g.\u000a        British Standards drafting committee)\u000a      Presentation of results as keynote for international conferences,\u000a        including the West Africa Built Environment Research Conference in\u000a        Nigeria (24-26 July 2012).\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The innovative construction procurement framework developed from research\u000a      conducted at the University of Reading between 2001 and 2012, has been\u000a      adopted by industry in the UK and overseas and has informed the\u000a      development of a new British Standard for construction procurement.\u000a      Working closely with a range of industry participants, the School of\u000a      Construction Management and Engineering developed a new understanding of\u000a      the costs of construction tendering and procurement.

In\u000a      particular, contractors' costs of tendering, though largely unquantified,\u000a      were believed to be disproportionately high and little was known about the\u000a      impact of these high costs on construction businesses. Little was also\u000a      known about the circumstances in which different forms of procurement\u000a      might facilitate or inhibit more general attempts to introduce innovative\u000a      and effective working practices that shift the process from competitive\u000a      tendering to a more co-operative and collaborative process. In 2001, a\u000a      research programme, initiated by a strong consortium of construction\u000a      clients, contractors, consultants and industry bodies, and led by the\u000a      University of Reading, set out to explore the structure and magnitude of\u000a      tendering costs and to examine more effective ways of procuring and\u000a      assembling project teams, which would benefit both the industry and its\u000a      clients.\u000a    Process\u000a    Fourteen leading construction and property businesses, including Amec,\u000a      Balfour Beatty, Kier Group, Land Securities, and Gardiner &amp; Theobald,\u000a      actively participated in the EPSRC funded research (Section 3 [8]). The\u000a      Reading team, led by Will Hughes, Professor of Construction Management and\u000a      Economics (April 1989 to date), conducted in-depth interviews with the\u000a      industrial participants and analysed their supply chain processes and\u000a      relationships in a series of case studies. As the project progressed, the\u000a      team worked very closely with industry participants that already had a\u000a      specific focus on improving collaborative work and were collecting data on\u000a      tendering costs. As a result, an extensive data set was obtained by\u000a      integrating industry data into Reading's existing research. The Reading\u000a      team used Transaction Cost Economics to develop, for the first time, a\u000a      deep understanding of tendering costs through different stages of\u000a      construction projects and for different tendering\/procurement processes\u000a      [1].\u000a    Quantifying tendering costs\u000a    The Reading team found that (a) construction companies did not monitor or\u000a      assess the costs of tendering; (b) tendering costs varied widely across\u000a      the construction sector, with contractors spending relatively little of\u000a      their turnover on tendering (0.5-3%) while consultants spent up to 20% of\u000a      their turnover on tendering [3]; and (c) there were instances where both\u000a      clients and construction businesses, each with their own objectives,\u000a      attempted to manipulate the market and tendering processes through power\u000a      relationships [3].\u000a    These findings allowed participating construction companies to develop a\u000a      better understanding of the costs associated with the tendering process,\u000a      and how they could manage and reduce these costs. By focusing on\u000a      transaction costs in their supply chains, contractors could, for example\u000a      identify and remove non value-adding inputs. Contractors could also seek\u000a      earlier involvement in the procurement process to help improve their bid\u000a      success rates and the costs of unsuccessful and abortive bidding [3].\u000a      Additionally, the research provided valuable insights to the client\u000a      participants about the processes of construction tendering and\u000a      procurement. In particular, it showed how these processes could be\u000a      designed and managed to provide more effective outcomes while avoiding the\u000a      potential for manipulation by tenderers in ways contrary to clients'\u000a      interests. Key recommendations for clients included the need to provide\u000a      bidders with full information at the start of the tender period, and to\u000a      allow sufficient time for tender preparation [2]; to keep tender lists\u000a      short and manageable; to select contractors on the basis of the value they\u000a      can contribute; and to standardise and simplify pre-qualification\u000a      processes and documentation [3]. By providing clear, empirically-based\u000a      evidence of tendering costs, the research benefits construction firms more\u000a      generally by helping them to assess how tendering costs vary by project\u000a      role and form of procurement.\u000a    The research was the first major attempt in the construction sector (and\u000a      likely in any other major industrial sector) to quantify and assess the\u000a      costs to industry of securing work through the tendering process. This\u000a      work provided the empirical basis for the development of improved\u000a      industry-wide guidance and standards on construction procurement.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43050","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact claimed for this work, disseminated by journal papers, reports\u000d\u000a      and presentations since\u000d\u000a      2006, is the influence on practitioners and policymakers at local and\u000d\u000a      national levels extending a\u000d\u000a      critique of the practice of CLP\/NP.

The research which\u000d\u000a      underpins the impact of the present case study was undertaken as part of a\u000d\u000a      wider agenda\u000d\u000a      examining the engagement of local communities in agenda setting at the\u000d\u000a      local planning level,\u000d\u000a      including CLP and parish planning, underpinned by variations of `localist'\u000d\u000a      thinking. A central theme\u000d\u000a      of the CLP approach is that locally and community co-produced plans and\u000d\u000a      actions support the\u000d\u000a      development of more constructive relations between community members,\u000d\u000a      local authorities and\u000d\u000a      other key actors, which serve to reorient attitudes towards particular\u000d\u000a      forms of development; for\u000d\u000a      example, affordable housing. The Reading research programme led by Parker\u000d\u000a      (appointed in 2000\u000d\u000a      as Lecturer in Planning Studies; Senior Lecturer, 2005; Professor, 2009)\u000d\u000a      has sought to understand\u000d\u000a      and measure the operation and characteristics of CLP. Commencing in 2006,\u000d\u000a      the research\u000d\u000a      programme includes consideration of affordable housing provision and the\u000d\u000a      link to forms of NP. This\u000d\u000a      work was prompted by a general trend towards more inclusive and\u000d\u000a      partnership-based models of\u000d\u000a      governance and a perceived need to better understand the practice of\u000d\u000a      neighbourhood-scale\u000d\u000a      planning activity. It aimed to develop both theory and practice in this\u000d\u000a      new and emerging field.\u000d\u000a      Moreover, as the lead researcher, Parker, was embedded in relevant local\u000d\u000a      and regional activity,\u000d\u000a      this allowed for a nuanced and deeper understanding of the politics and\u000d\u000a      agendas being pursued\u000d\u000a      which were beginning to shape the operation of community\/neighbourhood\u000d\u000a      planning in England.\u000d\u000a    The research took place in three phases: in 2006 on community planning at\u000d\u000a      the local level in West\u000d\u000a      Berkshire funded by the West Berkshire Partnership (LSP); in 2008\/9 with\u000d\u000a      further work on\u000d\u000a      community planning within West Berkshire funded internally by the\u000d\u000a      University; and in 2010 on rural\u000d\u000a      affordable housing and CLP in England funded by the Homes and Communities\u000d\u000a      Agency (HCA)\u000d\u000a      and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).\u000d\u000a    The first phase explored the experiences of those involved in the early\u000d\u000a      stages of parish and then\u000d\u000a      CLP, in a project conceived at Reading. The key questions here related to\u000d\u000a      the methods used, the\u000d\u000a      degree of inclusivity achieved in the process, relations and partnering\u000d\u000a      with support organizations,\u000d\u000a      the costs of the process and the key actions identified in the plans. The\u000d\u000a      research involved\u000d\u000a      interviews with CLP groups, focus groups with 6 communities and interviews\u000d\u000a      with key actors\u000d\u000a      including local authority officers, development workers and national\u000d\u000a      policymakers. The outcome\u000d\u000a      from this research, which focused on Berkshire (which had a high level of\u000d\u000a      CLP activity), identified\u000d\u000a      the need to: i) ensure well supported and designed methodology and quality\u000d\u000a      control over such\u000d\u000a      plans, ii) ensure high quality, robust plans that can claim to speak on\u000d\u000a      behalf of neighbourhood-scale\u000d\u000a      areas, iii) reinforce the importance of intermediaries to support and\u000d\u000a      advise communities in\u000d\u000a      this work. Some of these findings have been extended more recently and\u000d\u000a      have been developed in\u000d\u000a      new work around community planning and the post-political condition.\u000d\u000a    In Phase 2, the key questions centred on how attitudes changed and\u000d\u000a      relations were affected by the\u000d\u000a      process of engaging in CLP. This phase used a survey of all CLP groups in\u000d\u000a      the study supported by\u000d\u000a      key interviews. The research demonstrated that relationships between key\u000d\u000a      stakeholders improved\u000d\u000a      as a result of collaborative working and showed how interactions between\u000d\u000a      the interest groups were\u000d\u000a      facilitated by the CLP process. It also identified how willingness to\u000d\u000a      consider new housing changed\u000d\u000a      as new knowledge, understandings and needs were developed and recognised\u000d\u000a      by all parties &#8212; but\u000d\u000a      in particular within the communities themselves.\u000d\u000a    This led to the third phase work which was conducted on a national scale\u000d\u000a      and funded by the\u000d\u000a      HCA\/Defra. This research examined how CLP could actively develop better\u000d\u000a      understanding of the\u000d\u000a      role and need for housing development within local communities. It also\u000d\u000a      examined the resulting\u000d\u000a      local and intra-community issues as part of awareness raising and\u000d\u000a      development of responsible\u000d\u000a      behaviour towards `beyond local scale' needs. This research had a\u000d\u000a      particular focus on housing in\u000d\u000a      rural areas, and on the inter-action of communities and local authorities\u000d\u000a      and other agencies. The\u000d\u000a      main questions were: i) to identify where and how CLP has helped to\u000d\u000a      develop understandings in\u000d\u000a      communities, ii) to deconstruct where and how housing issues are discussed\u000d\u000a      in community\u000d\u000a      planning processes and, iii) to identify how that might be changed in the\u000d\u000a      future. This led to an\u000d\u000a      understanding of the factors that should be considered where housing is\u000d\u000a      needed in such\u000d\u000a      neighbourhoods. It also identified how the CLP approach can potentially\u000d\u000a      inform policymakers\u000d\u000a      nationally and how that feeds through to action and improvements to the\u000d\u000a      process at a local and\u000d\u000a      neighbourhood level.\u000d\u000a    This Phase 3 study involved a mix of quantitative analysis of the CLP\u000d\u000a      database and interviews with\u000d\u000a      key actors involved in CLP.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the lead researcher in all three projects (Parker), other\u000d\u000a      researchers involved were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Dr. Rachael Luck &#8212; RA, University of Reading (West Berkshire\u000d\u000a        Partnership 2006);\u000d\u000a      Dr. Claudia Murray &#8212; RA, University of Reading (Reading University\u000d\u000a        Research Endowment\u000d\u000a        Trust Fund 2008-9);\u000d\u000a      Ms. Tessa Lynn &#8212; RA, (now PhD researcher), University of Reading\u000d\u000a        (HCA\/Defra 2010)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The Reading contribution has been to examine the scope and capacity of\u000d\u000a      communities to plan and\u000d\u000a      construct local agendas effectively and then to reflect on the issues that\u000d\u000a      this presents for planners\u000d\u000a      and policymakers attempting to harness or work with communities in\u000d\u000a      creating evidence bases and\u000d\u000a      policies for their own neighbourhoods.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43237","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Overall Contribution: Our straw bale research has directly\u000d\u000a      contributed to the market development of ModCell, the award of UK and EU\u000d\u000a      patents and certification of the system [1 below].

In\u000d\u000a      2009-10 BaleHaus received substantial media coverage, including on local\u000d\u000a      TV (BBC, ITV), international, national and local radio (BBC), national and\u000d\u000a      international print media and internet exposure [5 below]. McCloud\u000d\u000a      officially opened BaleHaus in November 2009, attracting significant media\u000d\u000a      interest (see quote above). The Lilac Housing scheme, using BaleHaus\u000d\u000a      design, has more recently featured on BBC national TV (The Culture Show;\u000d\u000a      10.10.12). The CICM's reputation as a leading centre for innovative\u000d\u000a      construction materials research has increased, attracting new staff,\u000d\u000a      students, researchers and visiting academics. In 2010-2011 the Centre\u000d\u000a      completed a Knowledge Transfer Account Fellowship with BRE, aimed at\u000d\u000a      raising awareness and promoting wider uptake of renewable construction\u000d\u000a      materials. This included a series of workshops in the South West at which\u000d\u000a      over 400 participants attended.\u000d\u000a    Commercial impact: \"The research carried out at the University\u000d\u000a        of Bath has been instrumental in the growth of ModCell\" &#8212; Director\u000d\u000a      (ModCell Ltd). Since 2008 the commercial value of ModCell projects has\u000d\u000a      grown from &#163;11k in 2008 to over &#163;1.8 million in 2012; over the same time\u000d\u000a      ModCell staff grew from 1 FTE in 2008 to 10 FTE in 2012. The hemp-lime\u000d\u000a      construction market in the UK has grown from a few niche projects to over\u000d\u000a      250 completed projects, including Kevin McCloud's Triangle Project in\u000d\u000a      Swindon.

The research covered here\u000d\u000a      considers two related fields of work: prefabricated straw bale\u000d\u000a      construction and the development of the test building BaleHaus; hemp-lime\u000d\u000a      construction and the test building HemPod.\u000d\u000a    BaleHaus:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    Straw bale construction utilises a widely available agricultural\u000d\u000a      co-product to form highly insulated walls. Walker began by leading novel\u000d\u000a      research on developing the technical understanding of load-bearing straw\u000d\u000a      bale construction in 1999. Based on this initial work, in 2005 ModCell Ltd\u000d\u000a      approached Walker to collaborate in their development of prefabricated\u000d\u000a      straw bale cladding panels. Collaboration started with simulated wind\u000d\u000a      loading tests on panels for the award winning Eco-Depot project in York,\u000d\u000a      and has subsequently led to a series of UK Govt., and most recently EU\u000d\u000a      (EACI) sponsored research projects. At first this work focussed on\u000d\u000a      structural and durability aspects of the panels, leading directly to\u000d\u000a      refinements in panel design for enhanced structural performance (and\u000d\u000a      20-30% cost savings compared to the pre-research product design) and\u000d\u000a      better understanding of moisture transfer through panels and development\u000d\u000a      of improved specifications.\u000d\u000a    Directly as a result of this research, it was evident that the panels\u000d\u000a      could also be used to form low rise load-bearing walls. The BaleHaus\u000d\u000a      project included construction and performance testing of a prototype\u000d\u000a      two-storey house on campus at Bath [2]. As well as structure and\u000d\u000a      weathering analysis, tests improved understanding of fire, acoustic and\u000d\u000a      thermal performance. Bath's direct contribution to the development of\u000d\u000a      straw bale construction during the REF period includes: leading grant\u000d\u000a      capture activities (total research investment to date exceeds &#163;3 Million);\u000d\u000a      completing all constituent material and component design &amp; performance\u000d\u000a      evaluations, including structural and environmental performance [5];\u000d\u000a      developing computer design models; developing novel test protocols and\u000d\u000a      specifications; leading testing and monitoring of straw buildings [4,6];\u000d\u000a      product design development.\u000d\u000a    HemPod:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    Hemp-lime is a novel bio-based composite formed from a mixture of hemp\u000d\u000a      shiv and a hydraulic lime-based binder. Walker began working on hemp-lime\u000d\u000a      construction in 2002, exploring effects of hemp-binder water exchange on\u000d\u000a      the properties of the composite [3,6]. A DEFRA sponsored project at Bath\u000d\u000a      has been undertaking fundamental work on hygrothermal (heat and moisture\u000d\u000a      exchange) and structural performance of hemp-lime materials [1], including\u000d\u000a      construction and performance testing of the HemPod building on campus.\u000d\u000a      This work has directly contributed to improving thermal modelling of\u000d\u000a      hemp-lime buildings, such as the Science Museum building at Wroughton\u000d\u000a      (2012), and the award of a British Board of Agr&#233;ment certificate for\u000d\u000a      Hemcrete&#174; (2011). Bath's research contribution to the\u000d\u000a      development of hemp-lime construction during the REF period includes:\u000d\u000a      leading grant capture activities (total research investment to date\u000d\u000a      exceeding &#163;1 Million); completing constituent material characterisation\u000d\u000a      and development, including binder and mix design; establishing novel test\u000d\u000a      protocols and material specifications; product design development.\u000d\u000a    Kevin McCloud commented on the BaleHaus project at its opening in\u000d\u000a      November 2009: \"Right now there are a number of exciting technologies\u000d\u000a        emerging in construction, but what we lack is the performance data of\u000d\u000a        the different technologies ... it will be really interesting to see how\u000d\u000a        this building performs\" (see http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7lLMevwSj84).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43238","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    It is in the nature of architectural history that its outputs are of\u000a      interest to both an academic and a `popular' audience. The models\u000a      described here were made in order to `test' a new understanding of the\u000a      buildings and landscapes in question, as well as to visualise these in an\u000a      engaging way to the public. The chosen pathways to impact were public\u000a      exhibitions, lectures, and monographs, all of which have led to an\u000a      increased public awareness of the history and meaning of these buildings\u000a      as well as, more specifically in two Bath-based examples, to tangible\u000a      impacts for their custodians. Five post-2008 examples follow of how our\u000a      computer-visualisation research has led to public impact:\u000a    Hart's work on Andrea Palladio's four pilgrimage routes through Rome, as\u000a      described in his guidebooks of 1554, led to CASA's construction of a\u000a      computer model of them [see 4 above] and the translation of the guidebooks\u000a      published in 2006. This publication was reviewed in the popular press,\u000a      including The New York Times and The Times (by Jeanette\u000a      Winterson, see 1 below), assisting sales in general bookstores (including\u000a      Waterstones). A paperback edition appeared in 2009 and a Japanese one in\u000a      2011. Since 2008 (- December 2012, the last statement) it has sold 1,205\u000a      copies globally, through Amazon and bookshops, generating an income to the\u000a      American and UK publisher Yale UP of $22,308. The computer model of the\u000a      routes was publically exhibited at The British School at Rome, February\u000a      2008, funded by the British Academy and the Leche Trust; and at the George\u000a      Peabody Library, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA, March-April\u000a      2008, as part of the exhibition `Harmony to the Eyes' funded by the Samuel\u000a      Kress Foundation. Taken together, at least 700 people have seen the model,\u000a      ranging from the general public to academics and museum curators. The\u000a      exhibitions were supported by public lectures on the models by Hart at the\u000a      venues, each attended by around 200 people.\u000a    Computer models also informed Hart's monographs on John Vanbrugh and\u000a      Inigo Jones that were published in 2008 and 2011. They contained new\u000a      understandings of both architects, and computer models of their key\u000a      buildings that expressed this new understanding. The books and their\u000a      models have been widely reviewed in the popular press, including The\u000a        Oldie, Times Literary Supplement, Catholic Herald, The New York Times\u000a      and Apollo (\"the author engages computer modelling and\u000a      reconstructions to flesh out his interpretations\", see 2 below). They have\u000a      sold 2,973 copies globally (- December 2012, the last statement), through\u000a      Amazon (see 3 below) and bookshops, generating an income to Yale UP of\u000a      $116,768. The models of Vanbrugh's buildings formed the core of a\u000a      series of public lectures by Hart in 2008 in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and\u000a      Boston, thus reaching a more global audience, whilst the models of Jones's\u000a      buildings were discussed in public lectures at the Courtauld Institute,\u000a      London, the British School at Rome, the Universities of Kent and\u000a      Cambridge, as well as in talks and booksignings at Hatchards bookshop in\u000a      London and the Theatre Royal &amp; Toppings Bookshop in Bath. The average\u000a      audience for the lectures was 100 people. Hart has also spoken about the\u000a      research results of the Jones models in radio broadcasts for Australian\u000a      National Radio and BBC Radio 4 (both 2012; `Unbuilt Britain' available on\u000a      the BBC website). A Senior Partner of Lynch Architects wrote to Hart: \"we've\u000a        been referring to your work a lot recently\" (see 4 below).\u000a    The publication of Hart's Vanbrugh monograph coincided with the\u000a      successful campaign by the National Trust to preserve Vanbrugh's Seaton\u000a      Delaval in public ownership: the book was used to promote this campaign in\u000a      a number of popular journals: Andrew Mead in the Architect's Journal\u000a      (28 August 2008) opened with the fact that the house's \"future is\u000a      uncertain and the National Trust is trying to raise &#163;6.3 million to `save'\u000a      it. The full significance of the house clearly emerges in [this] thorough\u000a      and absorbing new monograph\", whilst Tim Knox (Director of the Soane\u000a      Museum) observed in the World of Interiors (1 October 2008) that\u000a      \"the recent news\" of the NT appeal \"makes this new book...especially\u000a      timely\". This public impact of the Vanbrugh monograph and its models led\u000a      to Hart being asked by the NT to be a co-signatory (headed by Lord Richard\u000a      Rogers) to an appeal letter published in The Times (6th\u000a      October 2008) see: http:\/\/www.beattiegroup.com\/prclients\/pr-press-releases.aspx?news=31&amp;id=10051\u000a    There has also been close collaboration between CASA and the National\u000a      Trust on a number of computer visualisation projects, including a\u000a      fully-researched reconstruction of the original gardens of Prior Park in\u000a      Bath (by Hart, Richens and Harney in 2009). The model was built for a\u000a      public exhibition of CASA computer-history projects in collaboration with\u000a      the Sorbonne, Paris, held at the R&#233;fectoire des Cordeliers, Paris, in\u000a      October 2009: see http:\/\/www.bath.ac.uk\/news\/2009\/10\/27\/sorbonne-exhibition\/.\u000a      The exhibition was visited by over 1,000 people, including students and\u000a      the general public, and was opened by the Sorbonne's President (George\u000a      Molini&#233;). It was supported by a public lecture, attended by around 200.\u000a      The model is intended for display in the visitor's centre at Prior Park.\u000a      This project has led to a collaboration with the NT on Engineering\u000a      Doctorates (co-funded between the Trust and EPSRC) piloting the use of\u000a      digital technology in `real-life', heritage sites managed by them (by\u000a      Shepherd in 2010-date). The project has thus-far led to employment of two\u000a      students, part-based at the NT's HQ at Swindon. The Head Curator of the NT\u000a      comments: \"Their research project...is already paying dividends,\u000a        and...has I believe begun to change the way that the Trust thinks about\u000a        the uses of new digital computing technologies\" (see 5 below). Over\u000a      the years CASA's graduate student staff have been taught advanced computer\u000a      modelling techniques developed at Bath and have then moved into industry\u000a      and set up their own consultancies applying this research (eg Joe Robson\u000a      (M.Phil. 1997) and AVR London: see http:\/\/www.avrlondon.com\/\u000a        ).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u0009\u0009\u000a    Pre-2008 models listed above have also continued to find pathways\u000a      to impact during the REF period. Firstly, the Napoleon Paris model was\u000a      supplied in June 2010 to Kensington Communications for the Canadian\u000a      documentary series called `Museum Secrets', for broadcast in January 2011.\u000a      Additionally, it has had 7,673 downloads [at November 2013] on Youtube (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3uXhErt5agA)\u000a      and is linked via the Napoleon Foundation, Paris (http:\/\/www.napoleon.org\/en\/fun_stuff\/video\/index.asp).\u000a      Secondly, the computer model of Spencer's Artists House was displayed in\u000a      `Sir Stanley Spencer: Between Heaven and Earth', September 2011-January\u000a      2012, at the Kunsthal Rotterdam. And thirdly, the use of the Bath computer\u000a      model (Day and Hart) for the development of key new buildings such as the\u000a      Thermae Bath Spa with Grimshaw Architects in 2006, has led to its use for\u000a      the New Southgate Shopping Centre by Chapman Taylor Architects in 2010.\u000a      The model was used to carry out early proportional studies of the streets\u000a      and urban spaces in Bath as well as to provide the context for the\u000a      architectural visualisation that was used during public participation\u000a      exercises. Harney and Richens have worked with the Bath Preservation Trust\u000a      to develop and install in Beckford's Tower a fully interactive (by the\u000a      public) model of the area of Bath between Lansdown Crescent and the Tower\u000a      (&#163;13K funded by the Heritage Lottery in 2011). This visualises the\u000a      landscape and buildings that William Beckford constructed between\u000a      1822-1844 and demonstrates them in new ways to the public. Its impact is\u000a      evidenced by increased visitor satisfaction at the Tower since its\u000a      instillation. The museum's Director comments: \"The model has gone down\u000a        brilliantly at the Tower. The visitors' response has been fantastic,\u000a        with locals who had vague ideas about the ride as well as tourists\u000a        really getting a lot from what it reveals about Beckford's landscape and\u000a        how the Tower itself fitted into it. Young visitors spend a significant\u000a        amount of time using it and then want to go out in the cemetery to see\u000a        what is there now. Visit lengths have also been increased noticeably for\u000a        family groups, as the parents get a chance to spend time in the museum\u000a        while the children are playing on the model. That is very beneficial to\u000a        visitor experience and satisfaction, and to the recommendation to visit\u000a        the Tower they will then go home and give friends\" (see 6 below).\u000a      Our impact, both cultural and economic, on the city of Bath as a visitor\u000a      attraction is notable, involving Beckford Tower, Prior Park, The Thermae\u000a      Bath Spa and Southgate. The total number of visitors to Bath and North\u000a      East Somerset each year is 4.5 million and the total tourism spend is just\u000a      under &#163;350million (source: Bath Tourism Plus: http:\/\/visitbath.co.uk\/media\/information-sheets\/btp-and-tourism-industry).\u000a    In terms of its reach, this research has thus had notable public impact\u000a      not only geographically (through book sales and public lectures in the UK,\u000a      USA, France, Australia, Holland, and Italy) but also through the high\u000a      profile of the venues, events and exhibitions. Carl Laubin, a leading\u000a      contemporary architectural artist, commented to Hart concerning the public\u000a      exhibition of Laubin's `Two Vanbrugh Capricci' at the Plus One Gallery,\u000a      London: \"Your books on Hawksmoor and Vanbrugh were a great help to me\"\u000a      (see 7 below).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Few can doubt the economic and social impact of the public's interest in\u000a      our historic environment.

Computer\u000a      models have been constructed in order to visualise and analyse important\u000a      historic buildings &amp; rural and urban landscapes. In some cases the\u000a      buildings and landscapes in question were never realised or were\u000a      destroyed, and so the computer provided the only means by which they could\u000a      be assessed. In the case of the 1995 model of Serlio's Renaissance stage\u000a      (above), earlier researchers had analysed the spatial relationships of\u000a      Serlio's scene as depicted in his original woodcuts, but the computer\u000a      model constructed using them made it possible for the first time to assess\u000a      the accuracy of the earlier findings [1]. The model enables the assessment\u000a      of the effectiveness of Serlio's perspective scenes, for example when\u000a      viewed from seats on the edge. The underpinning research for these models\u000a      employed traditional scholarship in the form of archival work (identifying\u000a      plans, drawings and views), and translation of historic texts that also\u000a      informed the monographs in which the models were published. The research\u000a      techniques involved in making the post-2008 computer models whose public\u000a      impact is described below were developed through a pioneering series of\u000a      earlier models, each a refinement of the last, displayed in exhibitions or\u000a      published in leading monographs [2-6]. These models include: Serlio's\u000a      stage (National Theatre Museum, 1998), Soane's Bank of England (Royal\u000a      Academy, 1999), Stanley Spencer's Artists House (Tate Britain, 2001),\u000a      Hawksmoor's Oxford (monograph, 2002, see 2), and Napoleon's coronation\u000a      route through Paris (The Napoleon Foundation, Paris, and the National\u000a      Maritime Museum, 2005).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u0009  \u000a    Since the mid-1990s CASA has also promoted the use of computer models in\u000a      the planning process, in developing tools to analyse and visualise\u000a      historic urban environments and landscapes. It has pioneered the\u000a      construction of very large computer models of urban environments, notably\u000a      through the model of the city of Bath contracted in the 1990s (sponsored\u000a      by Sainsbury's PLC) and continually updated (see: http:\/\/www.agocg.ac.uk\/reports\/visual\/casestud\/smith\/models1.htm).\u000aWorkshops\u000a      held with the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment in 2005,\u000a      attended by professionals, planners, academics and students, focussed on\u000a      how these computer tools could enhance public participation in heritage\u000a      planning and design. CASA's models are thus not only an innovative\u000a      research tool but also help to visualise to the public a new understanding\u000a      of historic buildings, landscapes and settings. The novelty of this\u000a      research has been recognised by our peers. Throughout the 1990s CASA\u000a      published in the journal Computers and the History of Art [1], and\u000a      its pioneering contribution was cited by Prof Will Vaughan in The\u000a        Subjects of Art History: Historical Objects in Contemporary Perspectives\u000a      (ed.

This was made possible in many cases\u000d\u000a      through a symbiotic relationship with Buro Happold (BH) initiated some 35\u000d\u000a      years ago by Ted Happold, then the Department's Professor of Engineering,\u000d\u000a      and there has been close cooperation with BH ever since &#8212; in research, and\u000d\u000a      just as importantly in its translation into challenging building projects.\u000d\u000a      Whilst the Department has benefitted from the recruitment of expert BH\u000d\u000a      staff with practical experience at all levels (including Harris and\u000d\u000a      Shepherd), BH have in turn according to a Senior Partner enjoyed \"privileged\u000a        access\" to our \"world-class research\". This has been \"a\u000d\u000a        significant factor in the firm's international growth and success. The\u000d\u000a        novel structural analysis techniques developed at Bath have led to\u000d\u000a        significant consultancy on major landmark buildings.\" He also\u000d\u000a      recognises \"the valuable role of Bath in training future researchers\"\u000d\u000a      [7]. In this way we have contributed directly to the UK economy.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    The impact on Foster's office of Bath's work on the BMGC roof was such\u000d\u000a      that they immediately set about creating an in-house `specialist modelling\u000d\u000a      group' to develop their own expertise in using our research methods to\u000d\u000a      inform the more geometrically complex of their projects. The Smithsonian\u000d\u000a      Institution (2004-7) is the most obvious beneficiary, designed and\u000d\u000a      engineered by the same team as the BMGC, and acknowledged on Foster's\u000d\u000a      website (http:\/\/www.fosterandpartners.com\/projects\/smithsonian-institution\/)\u000d\u000a      as further developing the structural and environmental themes first\u000d\u000a      explored in the BMGC. The idea of establishing a specialist geometry group\u000d\u000a      has now been taken up by most leading architectural and civil engineering\u000d\u000a      firms, for example Buro Happold SMART, Arup Advanced Geometry Unit (AGU),\u000d\u000a      Ramboll Computational Design Group (RCD), Zaha Hadid Architects\u000d\u000a      Computation and Design Group (CODE). In particular, SMART was set up by\u000d\u000a      Shepherd to focus on applying Barnes' Dynamic Relaxation methods, and RCD\u000d\u000a      is staffed entirely of Bath research graduates, showing how our\u000d\u000a      innovations have changed the way the industry approaches the design of\u000d\u000a      complex geometric buildings.\u000d\u000a    Indeed, according to the Director of Design at Ramboll UK, \"Since its\u000d\u000a        inception [in 2011], the RCD team have partaken in a number of projects\u000d\u000a        including Astana National Library (Kazakhstan), Tallinn Town Hall\u000d\u000a        (Estonia), Kreod Pavilion (UK), Belvedere Sculpture (USA) and Trada\u000d\u000a        Shell (UK), which would not have been possible without access to the\u000d\u000a        digital architecture-focussed research of Chris Williams and Paul\u000d\u000a        Shepherd\" [8].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    The group has been involved in the design of other significant buildings.\u000d\u000a      An early steel gridshell with which Williams and Barnes had involvement\u000d\u000a      was the Singapore Esplanade Theatres (Michael Wilford, 1997-2002) that has\u000d\u000a      been imitated by others during the REF period in Croatia (Dvorana\u000d\u000a      Kre&#353;imira &#262;osi&#263;a), Abu Dhabi (Yas Marina Hotel), Taiwan (Kaohsiung Marine\u000d\u000a      Gateway) and Frankfurt (Zeil Gridshell). Williams's research into novel\u000d\u000a      analysis of forms was applied in 2006 to a further gridshell at Savill\u000d\u000a      Garden (Glen Howells, Buro Happold) [9], where he and Harris (then\u000d\u000a      Technical Director of Buro Happold, joining the Department in 2006)\u000d\u000a      combined the blended-equation surface technique used at the British Museum\u000d\u000a      with relaxation methods of grid-smoothing and analysis. Indeed Williams\u000d\u000a      collaborated on the 2010 Gardens by the Bay gridshell (Wilkinson Eyre),\u000d\u000a      which won the WAF World Building of the Year award in 2012. An independent\u000d\u000a      project to build a GFRP gridshell by Douthe of the Universite Paris-Est\u000d\u000a      specifically acknowledges use of the Barnes\/Williams algorithms [10].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    Williams has developed his Dynamic Relaxation methods further to produce\u000d\u000a      gridshell roofs composed entirely of planar polygons. This is important\u000d\u000a      for glass roofs since the cost of curved glass is prohibitively high.\u000d\u000a      Williams applied this research as a consultant on the National Maritime\u000d\u000a      Museum in Amsterdam (Ney+Partners, 2011), a project which won several\u000d\u000a      architectural awards [11].\u000d\u000a    Williams provided consultancy for the design of the award-winning 2010\u000d\u000a      Aviva Stadium in Dublin, and supervised the PhD project that developed the\u000d\u000a      architectural parametric design of the fa&#231;ade. A parallel role on the\u000d\u000a      engineering side was played by Shepherd (initially at BH but then at Bath\u000d\u000a      and jointly supervising the PhD student). The parametric methodology they\u000d\u000a      developed allowed the structural and cladding models to adapt quickly to\u000d\u000a      late changes in the overall geometry of the building, preventing the\u000d\u000a      prohibitively expensive rework associated with traditional design. This\u000d\u000a      was the first time that a single model embracing both structure and skin\u000d\u000a      had been shared between architect and engineer [12].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    A further example of research directly impacting on industry through a\u000d\u000a      particular building is the 2012 Aarhus Botanical Garden Hothouse in\u000d\u000a      Denmark. Research software based on subdivision surfaces developed by\u000d\u000a      Shepherd was used (with architects C. F. Moller) to design and optimise\u000d\u000a      the design-competition winning building completed in summer 2013, which\u000d\u000a      was shortlisted for two IStructE Structural Awards [6].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    The most striking buildings to benefit directly from the group's research\u000d\u000a      into form-finding and analysis are undoubtedly the timber gridshells,\u000d\u000a      which have about one-sixth the CO2 cost of an equivalent steel\u000d\u000a      structure. Prior to this research, expensive physical models and\u000d\u000a      full-scale load tests had to be performed (as occurred at Mannheim) to\u000d\u000a      give confidence in the design, and rectification of any problems at such a\u000d\u000a      late stage was costly. The computational methods developed at Bath reduced\u000d\u000a      this risk and have been important in a number of projects where the\u000d\u000a      influence of our research is directly traceable in terms of knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer. These include Chiddingstone Castle (2007), the Savill Garden\u000d\u000a      building (which won the IStructE Supreme Award in 2007 [9]), and, during\u000d\u000a      the REF period, Scunthorpe Leisure Centre (2011). The last building was\u000d\u000a      designed by BH's in-house SMART group (originally set up by Shepherd),\u000d\u000a      which has employed many Bath graduate students and is currently sponsoring\u000d\u000a      one of our EngDs.\u000d\u000a    Apart from direct involvement in consultancy, the Bath group has another\u000d\u000a      major pathway by which its research impacts on industry and wider society,\u000d\u000a      namely through education. Finding sufficiently skilled staff for such\u000d\u000a      specialist modelling groups within consulting has been a challenge since\u000d\u000a      they first started to appear on the back of the BMGC roof project. To help\u000d\u000a      resolve this through CPD, Richens was among the founders of the Smart\u000d\u000a      Geometry movement, which today runs annual intensive workshops around the\u000d\u000a      world. Williams has been a tutor since the inaugural meeting in Cambridge\u000d\u000a      (2003), and several research students have made substantial contributions\u000d\u000a      as teachers at public workshops in New York (2007), Munich (2008), San\u000d\u000a      Francisco (2009), Barcelona (2010), Copenhagen (2011), Troy (2012), as\u000d\u000a      well as private ones in the offices of leading architects (such as HOK\u000d\u000a      Sport, 2007; Ian Simpson Architects, 2008) and engineers (such as Whitby\u000d\u000a      Bird, 2007; Atkins, 2012).\u000d\u000a    In 2009 Richens, Shepherd and Williams launched the Digital\u000d\u000a      Architectonics MPhil Research programme at Bath, which gives architects\u000d\u000a      and engineers in- depth exposure to the research methods developed by the\u000d\u000a      group, and guides them in developing their own in practice. Students have\u000d\u000a      been sponsored by several leading firms (BH, Arup, Ramboll, Schlaich\u000d\u000a      Bergermann &amp; Partners), taking approaches pioneered at Bath back into\u000d\u000a      practice, as evidenced by their subsequent publications [13-15]. These\u000d\u000a      training enterprises, and a steady flow of PhD and EngD students into the\u000d\u000a      professions has been a major route of dissemination of the philosophy,\u000d\u000a      methods and results of the group, and has had a significant role in\u000d\u000a      establishing the new sub-discipline of architectural geometry. The breadth\u000d\u000a      of influence is demonstrated by the firms which have employed our students\u000d\u000a      since 2008: Arup (2), Buro Happold (2), Fosters (1), Schlaich Bergermann\u000d\u000a      &amp; Partners (1) and overseas universities (2). Indeed in 2011 in a\u000d\u000a      scenario reminiscent of Fosters back in 2000, Ramboll set up a new\u000d\u000a      Computational Design group, staffed entirely by postgraduate research\u000d\u000a      engineers from the group, their first prize being for the demountable\u000d\u000a      timber Kreod Pavilion (Chun Qing Li) which won Best Temporary Structure at\u000d\u000a      the Surface Design Awards 2013.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Digital Architectonics group in the Centre for Advanced Studies\u000d\u000a        in Architecture (CASA) in the Department of Architecture and Civil\u000d\u000a      Engineering at the University of Bath has had continuous engagement with\u000d\u000a      leading architectural and engineering practitioners since its foundation\u000d\u000a      by the internationally renowned civil engineer Professor Sir Edmund\u000d\u000a      Happold in the late 1970s. Its unorthodox digital methods have been\u000d\u000a      fundamental to the recent establishment of architectural geometry\u000d\u000a      as a new specialism in both professions. One feature of this work is the\u000d\u000a      ability to addresses the common problem of how to cover large spaces (such\u000d\u000a      as courtyards and stadium roofs) without relying on intermediate supports\u000d\u000a      (such as columns). The novel structural analysis techniques developed at\u000d\u000a      Bath have led to significant consultancy on major landmark buildings. In\u000d\u000a      particular, the reductions in complexity, risk, and carbon footprint\u000d\u000a      resulting from such an approach have led to a re-emergence of the timber\u000d\u000a      gridshell as a cost-effective and spectacularly low-carbon building\u000d\u000a      solution.

This made possible the more accurate consideration\u000d\u000a      of strut-and-tie (tensegrity) structures [1] and gridshells [2]. Through\u000d\u000a      introducing analytical techniques to improve stability, the large\u000d\u000a      deformations associated with these types of structures could be accurately\u000d\u000a      modelled [3]. During this time, Williams was consulted by Buro Happold and\u000d\u000a      Foster+Partners on work to develop the form of the British Museum Great\u000d\u000a      Court roof (BMGC, opened in 2000), where he introduced two innovations to\u000d\u000a      architectural geometry [4,5]. The first was the use of `blended equations'\u000d\u000a      to describe the shape of the roof. The second was in the way the\u000d\u000a      structural grid was optimised using a modification of Dynamic Relaxation,\u000d\u000a      leading to the efficient and beautiful spiral form seen today.\u000d\u000a    In 2000 Williams and Shepherd (then at Buro Happold) investigated the\u000d\u000a      extension of Dynamic Relaxation to the design and construction of\u000d\u000a      gridshells made from long, continuous members. They applied this work to\u000d\u000a      the temporary cardboard gridshell by Shigeru Ban for the Japan Pavilion at\u000d\u000a      the Hanover Expo 2000, which was built entirely of recyclable material. At\u000d\u000a      the same time, these experimental algorithms were used to design the 2001\u000d\u000a      Weald and Downland Museum (Edward Cullinan, Buro Happold), the first\u000d\u000a      permanent timber gridshell to be built since Mannheim. It is important to\u000d\u000a      note that underpinning research and its impact on built structures have a\u000d\u000a      symbiotic relationship in this case.\u000d\u000a    Two very important conferences on this group's research were convened in\u000d\u000a      Bath in the early 2000s. Widespan Roof Structures (2000) [4]\u000d\u000a      brought together researchers and the designers of many Millennium\u000d\u000a      structures: the Dome, Eden Centre, BMGC, and the international stadiums at\u000d\u000a      Cardiff and Wembley. The Digital Tectonics conference (2002)\u000d\u000a      included architects Greg Lynn, Mark Burry, Bernard Cache, Lars Spuybroek,\u000d\u000a      and engineers Mike Cook and Cecil Balmond. This marked the point where\u000d\u000a      architects started to shed their technophobia and see digital technology\u000d\u000a      as having a genuine creative potential, as well as feeding ideas back into\u000d\u000a      research, and the resulting book is still in print [5]. Concerns over the\u000d\u000a      lack of design guidance for the wind loading of fabric structures meant\u000d\u000a      that many such building designs were overly conservative and inefficient.\u000d\u000a      This led Williams to collaborate with Greaves and their PhD students on\u000d\u000a      investigating fluid-fabric interaction. They looked for alternatives to\u000d\u000a      conventional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques and in\u000d\u000a      particular pioneered the application of a method of surface modelling used\u000d\u000a      in computer graphics (Subdivision Surfaces) to the simulation of airflow\u000d\u000a      around structures, especially important in cases where the shape of a\u000d\u000a      building changes significantly in response to wind.\u000d\u000a    In 2007 and with industrial funding from Informatix of Japan, Richens and\u000d\u000a      Shepherd investigated the use of the same Subdivision Surfaces to describe\u000d\u000a      architectural form [6]. Current work is leveraging the various advantages\u000d\u000a      that subdivision surfaces hold for analysis and optimisation over\u000d\u000a      traditional CAD modelling tools, through software that promotes the\u000d\u000a      simultaneous consideration of architectural and structural issues.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43240","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Highways Agency (the UK's largest bridge owning authority) and\u000d\u000a      Network Rail are responsible for maintaining almost 12,000 concrete\u000d\u000a      bridges, constructed as far back as the 1920s.

This\u000d\u000a      third edition (2012) contains additions based on Bath's more recent\u000d\u000a      research (deep embedment shear strengthening and column strengthening).\u000d\u000a      This allowed the first use of Bath's deep embedded bar technique to\u000d\u000a      increase the load capacity of a coffered floor slab in a data storage\u000d\u000a      centre in London in 2012 (a &#163;315k contract), the only feasible method to\u000d\u000a      carry out the strengthening [5].\u000d\u000a    Additionally, the Highways Agency (HA) requires designers using FRP to\u000d\u000a      strengthen HA infrastructure to comply with their document, BD85\/08, which\u000d\u000a      was revised in 2008 to incorporate the approaches that Bath had developed\u000d\u000a      for TR55 in 2004 (http:\/\/www.dft.gov.uk\/ha\/standards\/dmrb\/vol1\/section3\/bd8508.pdf).\u000a      The techniques developed by Bath for dealing with inadequately anchored\u000d\u000a      reinforcement were also incorporated into a recent revision of the\u000d\u000a      Highways Agency bridge assessment document, BD44, to be published in 2014.\u000d\u000a      This document too must be complied with by designers when dealing with HA\u000d\u000a      structures.\u000d\u000a    Engineering Consultants\u000d\u000a    The research on assessment of inadequately anchored reinforcement\u000d\u000a      was carried out in collaboration with the HA and Parsons Brinckerhoff, a\u000d\u000a      leading engineering consultant. One of the Bath researchers involved in\u000d\u000a      the work (Shave) is now employed by Parsons Brinckerhoff and he exploits\u000d\u000a      the technique for the benefit of their clients. During structural\u000d\u000a      assessment, they regularly encounter situations where anchorage of\u000d\u000a      reinforcement is short\/unknown. The techniques developed by Bath allow\u000d\u000a      them to assess the adequacy of these structures.\u000d\u000a    The Regional Associate of Parsons Brinckerhoff states: \"The\u000d\u000a      research carried out at Bath University on the shear assessment of\u000d\u000a      concrete bridges with short anchorage details has resulted in significant\u000d\u000a      economic and operational benefits related to the management of concrete\u000d\u000a      bridges. The particular issue identified in the research has cropped up in\u000d\u000a      around 5 of the bridges that Parsons Brinckerhoff has assessed since 2008\u000d\u000a      for Local Authority clients responsible for maintaining the local road\u000d\u000a      network. Without the findings of Bath's research, these structures would\u000d\u000a      have needed very expensive replacement or strengthening works amounting to\u000d\u000a      hundreds of thousands of pounds. However, we were able to advise the\u000d\u000a      clients on suitable management strategies including refined assessment\u000d\u000a      methodologies based on the direct application of the research, and this\u000d\u000a      has allowed these structures to remain in service. In addition, through\u000d\u000a      effective dissemination of the research, the benefits have been realised\u000d\u000a      to a greater extent across the industry, including the incorporation of\u000d\u000a      the methodology into the standard for assessment of concrete highway\u000d\u000a      structures, BD44.\" [6]\u000d\u000a    The Concrete Society's TR55 document allows consultants to propose\u000d\u000a      efficient, cost effective FRP strengthening schemes where,\u000d\u000a      otherwise, strengthening would be unfeasible or prohibitively expensive.\u000d\u000a      For example, consultants Tony Gee and Partners, in the last two years\u000d\u000a      alone, have carried out approximately 16 FRP strengthening schemes,\u000d\u000a      designed according to TR55.\u000d\u000a    The Executive Director, Tony Gee and Partners comments: \"The\u000d\u000a      publication of TR55 and subsequent update, have given clients the\u000d\u000a      confidence to specify the use of FRP materials. The research carried out\u000d\u000a      at Bath and elsewhere, together with contributions made by many respected\u000d\u000a      designers, provides evidence that the procedures in the document are\u000d\u000a      robust, efficient and safe. We no longer have to justify the robustness of\u000d\u000a      the technique to clients, who are delighted that we are able to preserve\u000d\u000a      structures that would otherwise need to be replaced at major additional\u000d\u000a      costs. We have even used the document to promote the technique overseas,\u000d\u000a      building a portfolio of over 200 FRP strengthened structures.\" [7]\u000d\u000a    Apart from preventing needless demolition of structures, whose\u000d\u000a      replacement cost would run into &#163;millions (replacement of a two lane\u000d\u000a      concrete motorway bridge costs &#163;1.5M-&#163;2M), large savings (hundreds of\u000d\u000a      &#163;thousands) are made, compared to conventional strengthening methods, due\u000d\u000a      to improved construction speed, site safety, and reduced road closure\u000d\u000a      costs. Another example of the impact of this work is a &#163;160,000\u000d\u000a      strengthening scheme in 2010 by engineering consultants Mouchel for\u000d\u000a      Minsterley Bridge, a Grade II listed concrete arch bridge which provides\u000d\u000a      the primary means of access to Minsterley. Research carried out at Bath on\u000d\u000a      curved soffit strengthening was used directly in the scheme, as too was\u000d\u000a      TR55 [8]. This allowed removal of a 7.5 tonne load restriction, providing\u000d\u000a      full lorry access for the benefit of local business.\u000d\u000a    Bath's FRP strengthening research has also been disseminated since 2003\u000d\u000a      through our undergraduate `Advanced Composites in Construction' taught\u000d\u000a      unit. Graduates have used these techniques in practice. For example, in\u000d\u000a      2009, Graduate Engineers at Integral Structural Design designed extensive\u000d\u000a      FRP strengthening as part of the refurbishment of Temple Circus in\u000d\u000a      Bristol, providing floor slab cut-outs for stairs and services, extending\u000d\u000a      the usable life of the building [9].\u000d\u000a    Infrastructure owners\u000d\u000a    Bath's research, via TR55 and BD85\/08, has fed into five major composite\u000d\u000a      strengthening schemes on HA owned concrete bridges since 2008, costing\u000d\u000a      between &#163;100,000 and &#163;600,000 each. The Bath research incorporated into\u000d\u000a      TR55 has also benefited Network Rail, who state that they make savings\u000d\u000a      well in excess of 30% (typically saving &#163;200,000 per bridge) by adopting\u000d\u000a      FRP strengthening schemes, compared to conventional techniques. They\u000d\u000a      estimate that, over the last 5 years, the savings have totalled in excess\u000d\u000a      of &#163;5 million [10]. While not all are concrete structures, this indicates\u000d\u000a      the scale of economic savings on bridges that have been made possible\u000d\u000a      using the techniques developed and disseminated by the Bath team.\u000d\u000a    Network Rail was closely involved in the project on assessment and\u000d\u000a      strengthening of laterally prestressed beam bridges. The work reassured\u000d\u000a      Network Rail that the affected bridges were not in danger and they have\u000d\u000a      therefore not been prioritised for further investigation, allowing\u000d\u000a      financial and manpower resources to be directed towards more critical\u000d\u000a      structures.\u000d\u000a    Society and the economy\u000d\u000a    The economic cost associated with lane closures due to bridge\u000d\u000a      maintenance, as calculated according to Highways Agency BA 28\/92, is\u000d\u000a      usually the highest cost associated with such works (typically\u000d\u000a      &#163;10,000-&#163;50,000 per lane, per day). Although difficult to quantify,\u000d\u000a      considering the number of bridges strengthened or assessed by the HA,\u000d\u000a      Local Authorities and Network Rail since 2008, the economic savings as a\u000d\u000a      result of Bath's research is clearly several &#163;million.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research within the Building Research Establishment's sponsored Centre\u000a        for Innovative Construction Materials (CICM) at the University of\u000d\u000a      Bath has allowed the life of concrete structures to be extended through\u000d\u000a      developing (a) proper methods for assessing existing capacity and (b) the\u000d\u000a      means to increase capacity where necessary. This has prevented buildings\u000d\u000a      and bridges (managed, for example, by large asset owners such as the\u000d\u000a      Highways Agency and Network Rail) from being condemned as unfit for\u000d\u000a      purpose, resulting in vast savings in reconstruction costs and preventing\u000d\u000a      disruption to infrastructure users. The work has led to the researchers\u000d\u000a      being commissioned to write guidance documents that are routinely used by\u000d\u000a      infrastructure owners and consulting engineers worldwide.

This problem was associated with bridges built\u000d\u000a      prior to 1972, designed to standards considered insufficient today.\u000d\u000a      Existing assessment guidance led to these bridges being condemned.\u000d\u000a      However, this `Federation Internationale du Beton' award winning research\u000d\u000a      developed a plasticity approach as the basis of a simplified assessment\u000d\u000a      procedure which showed that in many situations the capacity of these\u000d\u000a      poorly detailed structures was, in fact, sufficient [2].\u000d\u000a    More recently (2003-2006) an EPSRC project GR\/S18144\/01[3] led by Ibell\u000d\u000a      and Darby (with Valerio) has provided a shear assessment methodology for\u000d\u000a      bridges constructed using prestressed beams, laterally post-tensioned\u000d\u000a      together, which form part of the UK rail network. Existing assessment\u000d\u000a      methods for these bridges ignored the effect of lateral prestress on\u000d\u000a      capacity. The research showed that this prestress increased capacity by\u000d\u000a      over 40%, even if much of the prestress was lost. A plasticity approach\u000d\u000a      was developed to allow realistic assessment of these bridges [4].\u000d\u000a    Strengthening\u000d\u000a    As part of the same EPSRC project [3], Darby and Ibell developed a\u000d\u000a      strengthening method for when these bridges were found to have inadequate\u000d\u000a      capacity. The method, termed deep embedment strengthening, involves Fibre\u000d\u000a      Reinforced Polymer (FRP) rods glued into holes drilled through the beams\u000d\u000a      to act as additional shear reinforcement [5]. This `Institution of Civil\u000d\u000a      Engineers' award winning method is ideal for structures where the sides of\u000d\u000a      beams are inaccessible, preventing use of conventional externally applied\u000d\u000a      FRP. The technique is more efficient and ductile than alternative methods\u000d\u000a      and can be applied to slabs as well as beams.\u000d\u000a    Further research led by Darby and Ibell from 2000-present, has examined\u000d\u000a      other issues related to FRP strengthening of concrete structures such as\u000d\u000a      the effect of curved soffits, the presence of live load, the effect of\u000d\u000a      concrete cracking and moment redistribution in FRP strengthened structures\u000d\u000a      [6][7][8]. This work was incorporated into the second edition of the\u000d\u000a      Concrete Society's Technical Report (TR) 55 (published in 2004), the UK\u000d\u000a      guidance on strengthening concrete structures.\u000d\u000a    Following publication of TR55 further projects commenced to address the\u000d\u000a      gaps which limited the use of FRP strengthening.

Research by\u000d\u000a      MacGregor (Aberdeen) with international collaborators [Ref 1]\u000d\u000a      explains how the results of this\u000d\u000a      approach are problematic.\u000d\u000a    Recognising the limitations of appraisal-based indices, in 2008 the\u000d\u000a      Investment Property Databank\u000d\u000a      (IPD) funded Devaney (while based at Aberdeen) to produce a\u000d\u000a      complementary transaction-based\u000d\u000a      index for the UK commercial property market using data held by the company\u000d\u000a      as part of their\u000d\u000a      primary business (property performance measurement). Using econometric\u000d\u000a      methods, the first\u000d\u000a      value-weighted indices of the UK commercial real estate market were\u000d\u000a      derived. These revealed\u000d\u000a      stronger growth in prices in the run up to the peak of the UK market in\u000d\u000a      2007 than suggested by\u000d\u000a      appraisal-based indices. They also showed that returns are more volatile\u000d\u000a      and less autocorrelated\u000d\u000a      than previously suggested. The findings have been published in the form of\u000d\u000a      an academic paper\u000d\u000a      [Ref 2] and a consultation report, disseminated throughout the real estate\u000d\u000a      industry (see section 4).\u000d\u000a    Urban Regeneration Property Performance Index\u000d\u000a      In 2003 Hutchison (Aberdeen) with colleagues from the Universities\u000d\u000a      of Ulster and Glasgow\u000d\u000a      completed a major ESRC, RICS and ODPM funded project on the investment\u000d\u000a      performance of\u000d\u000a      property in regeneration areas [Ref 3]. Prior to this, there was\u000d\u000a      relatively little knowledge on the\u000d\u000a      performance of properties in regeneration areas with most indices\u000d\u000a      focussing instead on prime\u000d\u000a      markets. The research showed that rental growth was similar for\u000d\u000a      regeneration properties compared\u000d\u000a      to the prime market but highlighted a higher yield in the short to medium\u000d\u000a      term. Once a regeneration\u000d\u000a      area becomes established and rental growth emerges, investor interest is\u000d\u000a      stimulated resulting in\u000d\u000a      increased competition and a shortening of yields. The research led to,\u000d\u000a      amongst other things, the\u000d\u000a      establishment of a new urban regeneration property performance index which\u000d\u000a      was published on\u000d\u000a      annual basis from 2005 to 2011 by IPD and Savills (see section 4).\u000d\u000a    Local and national house price indices\u000d\u000a      Most developed economies have at least one national house price index\u000d\u000a      indicating house price\u000d\u000a      movements over time. The indices vary in terms of how they are\u000d\u000a      constructed. In this context,\u000d\u000a      Hoesli (employed on a partial contract at Aberdeen throughout the\u000d\u000a      REF period) conducted a series\u000d\u000a      of research projects with international collaborators on the alternative\u000d\u000a      methods of house price\u000d\u000a      index construction [see, for example, Ref 4]. Findings showed that list\u000d\u000a      price indices (such as the\u000d\u000a      index employed exclusively by the Swiss National Bank until 2008) can\u000d\u000a      exhibit a different price\u000d\u000a      path compared to hedonic indices which control for the quality of\u000d\u000a      properties. In particular, list price\u000d\u000a      indices appear to overstate price changes in booming housing markets and\u000d\u000a      understate price\u000d\u000a      movements in declining markets. As a result of the research, the Swiss\u000d\u000a      National Bank has chosen\u000d\u000a      to supplement its list price index with an hedonic index. The same hedonic\u000d\u000a      index has recently been\u000d\u000a      made available on the Swiss stock exchange (see section 4).\u000d\u000a    The development of sub-national house price indices is typically\u000d\u000a      constrained by data limitations\u000d\u000a      although the potential utility of such indices is clear.

Consequently, Smarter Choices\u000d\u000a      and calculations of\u000d\u000a      potential impact resulting from the work of CTR is now quoted or used in\u000d\u000a      UK sustainable transport\u000d\u000a      policy documents at national and the local level, together with many\u000d\u000a      climate change strategy\u000d\u000a      documents. In summary, the impacts can be summarised in the following\u000d\u000a      categories:\u000d\u000a    Impact on climate change policy.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aThe Effects of Smarter Choice Programmes in the Sustainable Travel\u000d\u000a          Towns directly informed\u000d\u000a        the Fourth Budget of the UK Committee on Climate Change's\u000d\u000a        recommendations that Smarter\u000d\u000a        Choices should contribute to carbon reduction targets from the transport\u000d\u000a        sector. Citing our\u000d\u000a        research (1), the CCC's 2010 report to Parliament (a) said: \"Based on\u000d\u000a        evidence from the\u000d\u000a        Sustainable Travel Towns, we propose that the rolling out of Smarter\u000d\u000a        choices initiatives across\u000d\u000a        all urban areas in the UK would result in cost effective emissions\u000d\u000a        reductions and wider\u000d\u000a        economic benefits (e.g. reduced congestion)...could reduce emissions in\u000d\u000a        2020 by almost\u000d\u000a        3MtCO2.\" (p120).\u000d\u000a      Similarly, Mitigating Transport's Climate Change Impact in\u000d\u000a          Scotland (MTCCI) (3) directly\u000d\u000a        informed Scottish Government climate change policy.

As a result, their policy review set out specific\u000d\u000a        targets relating to smarter\u000d\u000a        Choices across Scotland including \"all workplaces with more than 30\u000d\u000a        employees to have an\u000d\u000a        effective travel plan by 2022\" and \"personalised travel planning advice\u000d\u000a        provided to all\u000d\u000a        households in Scotland by 2022\" (p91).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Impact on national sustainable transport policy and associated\u000d\u000a          government funding\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The 2010 Spending Review announced &#163;560 million (later increased to\u000d\u000a        &#163;600m) for a Local\u000d\u000a        Sustainable Transport Fund which is now supporting 96 projects in 77\u000d\u000a        Local Authorities across\u000d\u000a        England. In the associated guidance by the DfT (c), research by CTR was\u000d\u000a        directly cited: \"This\u000d\u000a        recommendation draws heavily on the secondary data sources analysed\u000d\u000a        during the evaluation\u000d\u000a        of the Sustainable Travel Towns [citing (1)]\" (p25). This impact is\u000d\u000a        further corroborated by Dr\u000d\u000a        Lynn Sloman who says \"As a member of the DfT Expert Panel for assessment\u000d\u000a        of local authority\u000d\u000a        bids to the Local Sustainable Travel Fund, I reviewed more than 60 of\u000d\u000a        the 155 local authority\u000d\u000a        proposals for funding for Smarter Choice programmes.

Owen Wilson, leader of the STT demonstrator project\u000d\u000a        for Darlington\u000d\u000a        Borough Council has stated that the STT evaluation \"provided an\u000d\u000a        academically rigorous\u000d\u000a        independent evaluation including comparison with changes in travel\u000d\u000a        behaviour over the same\u000d\u000a        time period in other towns. Since publication, Darlington is leading on\u000d\u000a        delivering smarter travel\u000d\u000a        measures in the Tees Valley and the southern part of Durham County.\" (f)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Impact on campaigns and guidance produced by NGOs and public\u000d\u000a          transport operators\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      NGOs have taken on the evidence from the research and used it to build\u000d\u000a        the case for certain\u000d\u000a        packages of interventions to improve health and quality of life and\u000d\u000a        reduce carbon. As clarified\u000d\u000a        by Stephen Joseph of the Campaign for Better Transport (to which Prof\u000d\u000a        Anable was invited to\u000d\u000a        become a Policy Advisor in 2010) \"through the work by Prof Anable and\u000d\u000a        colleagues it can be\u000d\u000a        said that this area of transport policy now has a better evidence based\u000d\u000a        underpinning it than\u000d\u000a        many much larger transport investment programmes. Prof Anable's work on\u000d\u000a        behaviour change\u000d\u000a        has also been used more widely, including in specific projects funded by\u000d\u000a        the LSTF and other\u000d\u000a        sources, to segment local populations and target interventions at groups\u000d\u000a        and areas where\u000d\u000a        change in travel behaviour is most likely.\" (g)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Impact on the policy debate\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Prof Anable gets invited to advise local and national government on\u000d\u000a        Smarter Choices policy,\u000d\u000a        segmentation and evaluation. For example, in May 2011, The DfT wrote to\u000d\u000a        Prof Anable saying:\u000d\u000a        \"I know you have made extremely valuable contributions to this area of\u000d\u000a        work [Smarter Choices].\u000d\u000a        The department is also extremely grateful for the advice you have\u000d\u000a        provided on Smarter\u000d\u000a        Choices in the past. Given your expertise, the DfT is keen to receive\u000d\u000a        your thoughts on a\u000d\u000a        proposed approach to quantifying the impact of Smarter Choices over the\u000d\u000a        next 15-20 years.\"\u000d\u000a        The project manager for the STT evaluation at the DfT has also provided\u000d\u000a        a corroborating\u000d\u000a        statement. (h)\u000d\u000a      Based on her research findings, Prof Anable was further invited in\u000d\u000a        January 2011 to provide the\u000d\u000a        opening presentation to the House of Lords Science and Technology\u000d\u000a        Committee inquiry on\u000d\u000a        behaviour change and a further invitation to provide oral evidence to\u000d\u000a        the committee (d).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In summary, our work in Aberdeen provided evidence that went on to inform\u000d\u000a      a national roll\u000d\u000a      out of Smarter Choices initiatives with associated funding and policy\u000d\u000a      guidance. Impact continues to\u000d\u000a      expand in terms of reach and significance, as can be testified by Lynn\u000d\u000a      Sloman (e) who has built up\u000d\u000a      a consultancy specialising in Smarter Choices advice and evaluation.

This has taken place through a series of externally funded\u000d\u000a      research projects (noted below)\u000d\u000a      undertaken with a number of academic and non-academic partners in England,\u000d\u000a      Scotland and\u000d\u000a      several European cities.\u000d\u000a    In each case, CTR's specific contribution has been the design of\u000d\u000a      theoretically-informed\u000d\u000a      survey instruments to assess emotional, psychological and practical\u000d\u000a      motivations for travel and the\u000d\u000a      potential response to policy incentives and marketing campaigns. This has\u000d\u000a      involved innovations in\u000d\u000a      before\/after process and outcome monitoring using a combination of\u000d\u000a      qualitative and quantitative\u000d\u000a      survey-based techniques. Data generated by these evaluations has been\u000d\u000a      analysed by CTR and\u000d\u000a      has resulted in a unique approach to the segmentation of populations based\u000d\u000a      on the propensity of\u000d\u000a      individuals to adopt less car-oriented or carbon-intensive travel\u000d\u000a      behaviour.\u000d\u000a    A key innovation in this research is the identification of a core set of\u000d\u000a      survey questions that\u000d\u000a      place respondents in motivational segments and can be used directly as a\u000d\u000a      tool by Local Authorities\u000d\u000a      wishing to promote and\/or evaluate Smarter Choices. We have also been\u000d\u000a      responsible in each\u000d\u000a      study for the translation of traffic reduction potential into carbon\u000d\u000a      savings, and benchmarking the\u000d\u000a      cost-effectiveness of Smarter Choice initiatives against other transport\u000d\u000a      and non-transport policy\u000d\u000a      measures. This research has been used by local and national transport\u000d\u000a      policy makers in the UK\u000d\u000a      and beyond to identify success factors relating to the detailed design,\u000d\u000a      implementation and\u000d\u000a      governance of these policy initiatives, including local branding and\u000d\u000a      community consultation\u000d\u000a      processes.\u000d\u000a    The claimed impact has effectively been generated through four separate\u000d\u000a      projects (2008-2013),\u000d\u000a      with funding by the Department for Transport (DfT), The Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government and the\u000d\u000a      European Union (Intelligent Energy Programme). Prof Anable has led each of\u000d\u000a      these grants on\u000d\u000a      behalf of the University of Aberdeen, with input from Prof Nelson, Dr\u000d\u000a      Wright, and other academic\u000d\u000a      and non-academic partners contributing expertise in other areas. In 2008,\u000d\u000a      the DfT commissioned\u000d\u000a      Prof Anable (along with Prof Phil Goodwin (UWE and UCL), Dr Sally Cairns\u000d\u000a      (TRL\/UCL) and Dr\u000d\u000a      Lynn Sloman (Transport for Quality of Life)) to undertake an evaluation of\u000d\u000a      the impacts of their\u000d\u000a      investment in three `Sustainable Travel Demonstration Towns' (STTs)\u000d\u000a      affecting a total of 300,000\u000d\u000a      people (1). Based on analysis of large sets of individual and meta-data,\u000d\u000a      the Aberdeen element of\u000d\u000a      the research was able to identify specific groups who had adapted their\u000d\u000a      travel behaviour. Often\u000d\u000a      such changes occurred at particular transition points in people's lives\u000d\u000a      related to, for example,\u000d\u000a      changes of jobs, redundancy, starting college, retirement etc.. Analysis\u000d\u000a      tools were also developed\u000d\u000a      to translate the impact of different Smarter Choice measures on carbon\u000d\u000a      reduction targets at a\u000d\u000a      national level.\u000d\u000a    As the evaluation of Sustainable Travel Towns (STT's) progressed, the\u000d\u000a      Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government (through Transport Scotland) commissioned CTR (with Derek\u000d\u000a      Halden Consultancy\u000d\u000a      and Integrated Planning Ltd) to undertake a similar piece of work related\u000d\u000a      to seven towns across\u000d\u000a      Scotland (Barrhead, Dumfries, Dundee, Glasgow East End,\u000d\u000a      Kirkintilloch\/Lenzie,\u000d\u000a      Larbert\/Stenhousemuir, Kirkwall) (2). Based on the experience of work with\u000d\u000a      the English STT's, and\u000d\u000a      adopting a segmentation approach, baseline data collection was undertaken\u000d\u000a      in advance to inform\u000d\u000a      the study, this then combined with data collected during and after the\u000d\u000a      interventions themselves for\u000d\u000a      analysis purposes. From the Scottish experience, the impact of the\u000d\u000a      interventions as evidenced by\u000d\u000a      the research was more mixed in terms of behaviour change. Nevertheless, a\u000d\u000a      third project was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Scottish Government, led by Prof Anable in partnership\u000d\u000a      with Atkins, modelled\u000d\u000a      the potential carbon reductions from a spectrum of devolved transport\u000d\u000a      policy mechanisms in\u000d\u000a      Scotland with CTR leading on the modelling of Smarter choice interventions\u000d\u000a      in Scotland (3).\u000d\u000a    As a result of ongoing research findings related to Smarter Choices and\u000d\u000a      segmentation\u000d\u000a      approaches, Prof Anable was invited to deliver the keynote address at a\u000d\u000a      major European\u000d\u000a      conference (ASTUTE December 2008). This subsequently led to an invitation\u000d\u000a      to join a consortium\u000d\u000a      of EU local authorities as the sole academic partner in an EU project\u000d\u000a      `SEGMENT'&#8212;- SEGmented\u000d\u000a        Marketing for ENergy efficient Transport (2010), as part of the\u000d\u000a      Intelligent Energy Europe\u000d\u000a      programme, with the cities of London (Borough of Hounslow), Munich\u000d\u000a      (Germany), Utrecht\u000d\u000a      (Netherlands), Almada (Portugal), Gdynia (Poland), Sofia (Bulgaria) and\u000d\u000a      Athens (Greece) (4). CTR\u000d\u000a      led the technical design of the research and analysis of the results. This\u000d\u000a      project, completed in\u000d\u000a      2013, comprised an evaluation and monitoring of Smarter Choice\u000d\u000a      interventions in these seven\u000d\u000a      European cities using the segmentation approach specifically to inform the\u000d\u000a      design of the\u000d\u000a      intervention mechanisms and evaluate behavioural outcomes. An interactive\u000d\u000a      survey tool has been\u000d\u000a      developed that can be used by local authorities to learn about and inform\u000d\u000a      travel choices and\u000d\u000a      behaviour and to evaluate and monitor responses. This tool has recently\u000d\u000a      been adopted by Utrecht\u000d\u000a      (July 2013) and Cornwall Council (August 2013) although its impact in\u000d\u000a      these locations is yet to be\u000d\u000a      measured.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43525","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research activities on improving standards in professional practice have\u000a      resulted in the developments in health and safety and risk management,\u000a      identification of improvements to techniques in cycling measurement and\u000a      data collection, improvements in teaching practice and support for\u000a      students with disabilities, improvements in procurement practice at Leeds\u000a      City College, and improvements in the energy performance of computer\u000a      intensive buildings in Higher Education.\u000a    Research by Walker and Davies informed the development of a new section\u000a      on health and safety in the 2012 BSi BS8210 standard in facilities\u000a      maintenance management (see Ref 3.2).

The research further identified a causal link between health and\u000a      safety and company profitability in SMEs. The potential impact of this\u000a      research lies in its findings of the evidence required by the HSE in\u000a      justification of its emphasis on investment in health and safety.\u000a    Research on improvements to methodologies and techniques for cycling\u000a      measurement is being applied by Sustrans who developed and undertook the\u000a      Sustainable Transport project in conjunction with the University. The\u000a      research revealed serious problems with data quality, and in particular,\u000a      large amounts of missing data. There are also problems with the\u000a      representativeness of count sites. These findings will lead to improvement\u000a      of standards in data collection, both how and where collected. Sustrans\u000a      have recently changed the way they select sites and have implemented a new\u000a      data collection and analysis system which will go some way towards dealing\u000a      with the problem of missing data. A new classification system has been\u000a      developed and groups of counters have been modelled to provide parameter\u000a      estimates for day of the week, month of the year and bank holidays.

Further doctoral work (RAE2008 funded)\u000a      by Arewa (2010-14), found a link between the application of best practice\u000a      in construction site safety and corporate profits. Construction companies\u000a      have been reluctant to spend on health and safety, seen as a cost and a\u000a      `drain' on profit. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and others have\u000a      frequently argued, without evidence, that sensible spend on health and\u000a      safety is quite the reverse; and spending on safety is an investment that\u000a      has spin off into many areas of production and thus increases profits.\u000a      This research sought the evidence for these assertions.\u000a    As a member of the FMW1 Facilities Management sub-committee of the\u000a      British Standards Institute, we undertook research to support the review\u000a      of the BSi Standard BS8210 Guide to Facilities Maintenance Management\u000a      (2011-12, in-kind contribution). Walker and Davies contributed to the\u000a      development of health and safety in the guidance, whilst Nelson led the 2nd\u000a      review committee and authorship. Doctoral research by Walker was\u000a      translated into material for the guide.\u000a    Research by Farrell and Challendar (2013) investigated the application of\u000a      partnership principles in a period of market austerity with Leeds City\u000a      College. It identified that some large companies are returning to\u000a      competition, whilst others still procure projects under the partnering\u000a      banner; but indeed, resort to competitive and sometimes `unfair' market\u000a      practices.

Over 4,700 handbooks have been sold during\u000d\u000a      the REF impact period. 62% of all new homes use the robust details scheme\u000d\u000a      [5.1] and this is a testament to the transfer of the research findings\u000d\u000a      into a Handbook specification format which is easily incorporated into\u000d\u000a      architectural details. There have been 1,900 site inspections and 6,000\u000d\u000a      on-site sample acoustic test undertaken (2008-13) which are entered into\u000d\u000a      the UK's (and world leading) most in-depth sound insulation database. Over\u000d\u000a      600,000 people in the UK now live in 300,000 robust detail homes built\u000d\u000a      during 2008-2013 [5.2]. 30 new innovative robust details using UK\u000d\u000a      manufactured products have been developed during 2008-13, delivering over\u000d\u000a      300 wall and floor combinations for architects and developers to specify\u000d\u000a      in apartments.\u000d\u000a    Smith et al research to develop patents for technical compatible\u000d\u000a      solutions for acoustics and structure led to innovative new products such\u000d\u000a      as Icopal-Bridgestop. This was approved as a robust detail (RD\u000d\u000a      ref:E-WM-19) in December 2009 as the highest sound insulation separating\u000d\u000a      wall in the UK. It provides the maximum 4 credits for the Code for\u000d\u000a      Sustainable Homes \"Health and Wellbeing\" [5.3] delivering enhanced quality\u000d\u000a      of life for occupants versus minimum building standards. Scottish building\u000d\u000a      standards also incorporated the Robust Details approach in 2011. The\u000d\u000a      resultant outputs of 5 published patents from Smith's team have all been\u000d\u000a      declared robust detail compliant since 2008 and form a suite of 16\u000d\u000a      products manufactured in the UK, with a combined turnover of over &#163;3\u000d\u000a      million. The \"Acoustic Wall Strap\" for timber frame party walls [5.4] was\u000d\u000a      designed to deliver high sound insulation performance is licensed in North\u000d\u000a      America (2009) which has a 90% timber frame market and was also granted a\u000d\u000a      full European patent (3rd July 2013). The product uses 30% less\u000d\u000a      steel but has twice the compressive strength which will enhance structural\u000d\u000a      stability for future climate change issues such as high wind loadings on\u000d\u000a      buildings.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 Smith's team were awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize\u000d\u000a      for \"Innovative housing construction for environmental benefit and quality\u000d\u000a      of life\" awarded for the outstanding impact to industry, environment and\u000d\u000a      society [5.5, 5.6] from the original Robust Standards Details research\u000d\u000a      project.\u000d\u000a    In 2010 the RD approach annually saved the industry &#163;14 million and\u000d\u000a      reduces 17,000 car journeys from the UK's roads by not having to undertake\u000d\u000a      large scale testing [5.7]. During 2008-13 Smith has given over 20\u000d\u000a      seminars on sound insulation and product innovation to the UK construction\u000d\u000a      industry and government departments totalling over 900 attendees. In\u000d\u000a      addition he has given invited international presentations to Italian\u000d\u000a      authorities in Rome (October 2009) and Milan (Feb 2011) [5.8], Swedish\u000d\u000a      industry and government organisations (Stockholm October 2010) and Hong\u000d\u000a      Kong\/China officials in (January 2013).\u000d\u000a    Smith was nominated by European countries to lead the EU COST\u000d\u000a      Action TU0901 WG3 (2009-13) to develop new robust solutions involving 29\u000d\u000a      EU countries and Canada, New Zealand and Australia [5.9]. The significant\u000d\u000a      on-site sound insulation database developed for Robust Details supported\u000d\u000a      by Smith's team allowed the first comparative analysis of the proposed\u000d\u000a      changes to ISO 717 (NP 16717). This invited paper demonstrated how the\u000d\u000a      proposed ISO changes to performance descriptors from Germany would not\u000d\u000a      deal with addressing low frequency sound insulation issues in real\u000d\u000a      attached homes. This led to the UK and Scottish government departments\u000d\u000a      writing to the Chair of the ISO committee and the UK ISO representatives\u000d\u000a      being able to advise the ISO committee on sound insulation performance\u000d\u000a      prescriptors and their influences leading to a refreshed approach to a\u000d\u000a      future ISO 717.\u000d\u000a    Finally, in 2012 the Government undertook a review of the Effect of Noise\u000d\u000a      Policy Interventions (funded by Defra) which demonstrated the positive\u000d\u000a      impact for compliance rates due to the RD scheme.

The\u000d\u000a      RSD project involved 119 industry members, public sector and over 20\u000d\u000a      industry organisations.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research involved using the Edinburgh Napier large-scale\u000d\u000a      database of on-site sound insulation measurements to identify key trends\u000d\u000a      and weaknesses in existing construction designs and their performance. The\u000d\u000a      research team analysed construction techniques which would deliver a\u000d\u000a      safety margin for design, workmanship, technical compatibility with other\u000d\u000a      regulations (e.g. structure) and enhanced performance. Research was also\u000d\u000a      undertaken to review the implications of International Standards, ISO 717\u000d\u000a      acoustic spectrum adaptation terms for airborne sound transmission. Using\u000d\u000a      a statistical approach to deliver a 95% confidence of achieving enhanced\u000d\u000a      +5 decibel sound insulation better than building regulations, the research\u000d\u000a      team then designed a series of specifications for the house building\u000d\u000a      industry to build and test.\u000d\u000a    During 2002-03 the industry built 1,400 new homes incorporating new\u000d\u000a      acoustic robust designs by Smith et al which were tested on site\u000d\u000a      and the research team undertook computer modelling and empirical data\u000d\u000a      analysis during the on-site period.

Since 2008 they used the 'Feedback Board' system in all of their sites. This has become a critical motivator, increasing buy-in from site workers and contributing to reduced accident rates; the REF period from 2008 to 2013 has seen accident incident rates (AIR) fall to 3.5, which is roughly half the industry average and about 30% of MACE's 2006 figures [6].\u000d\u000aSkanska, another leading global player, with 56,700 employees and EUR15bn turnover have adopted the Gateway Model to plan for OSH. Their Lost Time Accident Rate for 2012 has dropped by 50% compared to 2005 [3].\u000d\u000aGeneral uptake of GCU research in industry is further demonstrated by Lend Lease and Morgan Sindall [9] who now have 'Feedback Boards' on all sites.\u000d\u000aPublic policy and services\u000d\u000aThe research has led to legal changes, with the UK Construction Design and Management Regulations 2007 being modified to reflect the good practice developed. Specifically, the HSE and CITB (Government appointed bodies) and other organisations have incorporated the recommendations from the research in a number of industry guidance publications including:\u000d\u000aCDM 2007 Industry Guidance; Annex H (involving the workforce); published 2008 (Note GCU acknowledgment at foot of last page) [4].\u000d\u000aConstruction (Design &amp; Management) Regulations 2007: Industry Guidance for Designers (CITB- Construction Skills) with use of Gateways [1].\u000d\u000aSaferDesign.Org: STAGE (Safety Targeted Assessment via Gateway Evaluation) [2].\u000d\u000aCritical Safety Communication (Module F5); CITB-Construction Skills GE700 (Construction Site Safety Manual); published 2009 [10] and part of the 'Site Managers Safety Training Scheme' (SMSTS) cited in HSE competence criteria (CDM Approved Code of Practice) for construction professionals (http:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk\/pubns\/priced\/l144.pdf).\u000d\u000aPractitioners and services\u000d\u000aThe Critical Safety Communication (Module 5) in the Construction Site Safety Manual referenced above is now used by over 100,000 construction managers, supervisors and professionals every year, since 2009, as part of standard industry training [8].

In the UK, it accounts for 5% of employees but 27% of fatal workplace injuries and 9% of reported major injuries (HSE 2010\/11 figures). The resulting human and economic costs of accidents\/injuries etc. are substantial. Our researchers (three full-time academics and two international collaborators) focus on managing OSH in construction, including work specific to the UK's Construction Design and Management (CDM) Regulations, which set the regulatory framework for OSH planning, worker participation and communication of OSH information. A selection of projects \/ high quality outputs are given that have had significant impact on industry guidance \/ practice regarding these three OSH duties. It is difficult to make direct causal links between management activities and accident rates: however, testimony from OSH Directors (listed separately) helps confirm that the outputs of our research have contributed to the reduction in accidents.\u000d\u000aGateways (allied to project planning)\u000d\u000aFunded by the UK's HSE (&pound;97,000) in 2002 (RR263\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk\/research\/rrhtm\/rr263.htm), this 18 months long project collected qualitative data via three expert focus groups and 30 in-depth individual interviews. This resulted in the development of a 'Gateway' process model and associated tools for integrating the management of OSH with construction project planning [1, 2]. Gateway process models existed before this research, but the OSH aspect was superficial. Our findings provided the first substantive description of how to integrate OSH planning with general construction project planning - as opposed to treating it as a separate safety function.\u000d\u000aWorker Engagement (allied to participation)\u000d\u000aFunded by EPSRC (&pound;14,000) in 2003, 6 months (GR\/S25494\/01\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/gow.epsrc.ac.uk\/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=GR\/S25494\/01) and HSE (&pound;98,000) in 2006,12 months (RR516 http:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk\/research\/rrhtm\/rr516.htm), these studies arose from recommendations in the 'Gateways' research, to link planning with participation, a step not taken by other academics developing construction process models. The ESPRC project was jointly completed with the University of Kentucky. This resulted in identification of Critical Success Factors of effective worker engagement, with recommendations for best practice. Theoretical constructs were developed, which included the need for 'motivators' and 'trust' [3] and practical strategies tested - face to face talks, informal communication and the use of a 'feedback' board - were identified as most effective [4].\u000d\u000aCommunication with Migrant Workers (allied to communication)\u000d\u000aFunded by CITB\/Construction Skills, (&pound;79,000) in 2008 for 9 months, this project developed a specialist methodology for validating images which communicate OSH knowledge effectively, especially for those whom English is not their first language. This work was borne out of the 'Worker Engagement' research, as migrant workers were identified as a group consistently missed by OSH 'engagement' initiatives. \u000d\u000aBefore this research was published, the use of images to communicate OSH information was restricted to safety signs and posters. The use of images to communicate OSH information to a multi-cultural workforce is now becoming more common on construction projects e.g. the London Olympics.

For example, the Society for the Protection of Ancient\u000d        Buildings, following advice from Dr Baker, has pursued a complementary\u000d        programme of investigations on thermal performance of different\u000d        vernacular constructions[4].GCU's\u000d        research along with others has increased interest in the refurbishment\u000d        of traditional buildings and has resulted in the formation of the\u000d        Sustainable Traditional Buildings Alliance (STBA) of which GCU is a\u000d        member. One of the main issues to come out of the research is the\u000d        discrepancy between the heat loss of solid walls as measured in situ and\u000d        the standard calculated values, which tend to underestimate the thermal\u000d        performance of traditional walls and consequently the energy rating of\u000d        the building. The consequence of this gap needs to be more widely\u000d        understood within retrofit processes. The STBA has brought this to the\u000d        attention of the UK Government Department for Energy &amp; Climate\u000d        Change (DECC), since the energy rating of the building before upgrading\u000d        affects the financing of the energy efficiency measures which may be\u000d        implemented in the Green Deal (the UK Government's scheme for energy\u000d        saving in homes and businesses). These concerns have resulted in DECC\u000d        re-evaluating its understanding of how the Green Deal should be\u000d        implemented in traditional buildings. In 2012 it commissioned the STBA\u000d        to identify existing research and guidance that could (a) aid the\u000d        responsible design and decision-making process for the Green Deal in\u000d        older and traditional buildings and (b) identify gaps in knowledge where\u000d        further information and guidance could help optimise the delivery of the\u000d        Green Deal in these properties.

These projects have resulted in improved\u000d      testing and analysis procedures, which have been applied to, for example,\u000d      the integration of photovoltaics in buildings[1].\u000d        Sanders\u000d    \u000d        developed expertise at BRE in condensation and moisture problems in\u000d        buildings with an understanding of climate impacts on buildings. Since\u000d        joining GCU in 2003 they have participated in Engineering Historic\u000d        Futures[2] (GR\/S18359\/01,\u000d        total &#163;410k), part of the EPSRC climate-change research initiative\u000d        \"Building Knowledge for a Changing Climate\", which examined the issues\u000d        arising from water damage to historic buildings, and focused on\u000d        developing appropriate methodologies for drying, producing guidance for\u000d        the key stakeholders (English Heritage, Historic Scotland, the National\u000d        Trust, and the Ecclesiastical Insurance Group plc, the leading insurer\u000d        of historic buildings in the UK) on the drying out of historic buildings\u000d        to avoid hygrothermal stresses in the building fabric. Currently, the\u000d        Centre is involved in a FP7 project, Climate for Culture (Grant\u000d        Agreement no. 226973, &#163;280k, 2009-2014) which builds on this previous\u000d        experience. The project concerned future-proofing our heritage in the\u000d        face of climate change. Our role in the project is developing building\u000d        simulation models to assess the impact of climate change scenarios\u000d        including driving rain on the building fabric and the internal\u000d        environment within historic\/traditional buildings. Following the\u000d        Engineering Historic Futures project, the Centre has attracted over\u000d        &#163;250k funding from Historic Scotland and English Heritage. Both\u000d        organisations consider the fifth of UK's dwelings, which are\u000d        traditionally constructed, have significant value to UK's built\u000d        heritage. The key issue with these buildings is how to make them energy\u000d        efficient, in a way that does not detract from their character or damage\u000d        the building fabric. Initially research on evaluating energy efficiency\u000d        measures for traditional windows was carried out[3].\u000d        The research has provided practical information on simple energy\u000d        efficiency measures for traditional timber windows. Subsequently we have\u000d        carried out research on evaluating the thermal performance of\u000d        traditional buildings in Scotland[4] and\u000d        England, which contributes towards guidance for energy performance\u000d        assessments. This work is underpinned by previous work on thermal\u000d        performance carried out by Baker in European projects (PASSYS I &amp;\u000d        II, IQ-Test, DAME-BC)[5].\u000d        We have developed research programmes with both Historic Scotland and\u000d        English Heritage which focus on the evaluation of risk of moisture\u000d        problems post-refurbishment. Risk evaluation is based on a clear\u000d        understanding of the principles of moisture transfer and its measurement\u000d        in buildings developed during research projects including International\u000d        Energy Agency Annexes 14, 24 &amp;41[6].\u000d    \u000d    "}]

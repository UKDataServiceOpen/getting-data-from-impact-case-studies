British\u000a      Cycling and British Triathlon scientists used the model to formulate\u000a      pacing strategies and inform equipment selection when Britain's elite\u000a      athletes race on technically challenging courses. For example, the basis\u000a      of this model was used to formulate the pacing strategies and race\u000a      equipment selection for Britain's elite cyclists in the time- trial at the\u000a      2008 Beijing Olympics (at which Emma Pooley won a silver medal). The model\u000a      was used to calculate specific scenarios of the impact on final race time\u000a      of varying power output for different sections of major championship\u000a      courses over the recent Olympic cycle.\u000a    In 2010 the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and in 2011 the British\u000a      Paralympic Association both used this model to assist with the preparation\u000a      of Australian cyclists and British Paralympic riders respectively. The AIS\u000a      awarded Patrick Cangley (PhD student co-supervised by Passfield) a\u000a      \"Visiting Scholarship\" to fund his travel to Australia and his\u000a      accommodation whilst working with their scientists in Canberra. As this\u000a      model provided a significant advance on their own previous (published)\u000a      models the AIS scientists wanted to examine a number of what-if scenarios.\u000a      The Cycle Racing Model enabled sport scientists at the AIS to explore many\u000a      aspects of cycling performance and help their coaches and athletes in both\u000a      track and road cycling disciplines. For example, joint torque was\u000a      calculated with the model using inverse dynamics to better understand and\u000a      inform specific Australian cycling team race and training practices. The\u000a      British Paralympic Cycling team used the model to quantify the demands of\u000a      the London 2012 Paralympic cycling course at Brands Hatch. This data was\u000a      then used to fine tune the final preparation of British riders for this\u000a      event and derive optimal race scenarios. The British Paralympic road\u000a      cycling team won three gold, two silver and two bronze medals at the\u000a      London Games. It is the exceptional mechanical detail of this model that\u000a      has made it so valuable to scientists at the English Institute of Sport\u000a      supporting British Cycling and British Triathlon's elite athletes. Indeed\u000a      the model continues to be used to evaluate novel \"what if\" scenarios for\u000a      various aspects of cycling competition and training and Passfield\u000a      continues to use the model to assist British Cycling scientists with new\u000a      novel applications of the model.\u000a    The Wattbike is a successful commercial cycle ergometer that is sold\u000a      around the world. It is endorsed by British Cycling and used by them and\u000a      Cycling Australia as part of their elite and talent development\u000a      programmes. British Cycling uses the Wattbike to help identify talented\u000a      cyclists for the future. The Cycle Racing Model was used to develop the\u000a      algorithm incorporated into the Wattbike software to simulate a rider's\u000a      cycling speed from the ergometer power output. This algorithm is\u000a      fundamental to the use of the ergometer as it provides the basis of the\u000a      distance and speed covered when riding on the ergometer. It also enables\u000a      the rider to monitor performance over set distances and to race against\u000a      another rider on a different ergometer.\u000a    Sprint Cycling Model\u000a    Scientists working with the British Cycling sprint team that included\u000a      Olympic Champions Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton CBE used the sprint\u000a      cycling model to help devise the sprint race tactics of this team. In\u000a      order to maintain a competitive advantage, publications from this work\u000a      were embargoed until after the London 2012 Olympic Games and are only now\u000a      being fully published. Cycle Training Model\u000a    The Cycle Training Model was motivated by the need to better understand\u000a      the wealth of data (e.g. power output, heart rate, cadence) that it is now\u000a      possible to obtain from cyclists and their bicycles when training and\u000a      racing. Several studies from the Endurance Research Group have led to a\u000a      change in understanding training practices for elite endurance cyclists.\u000a      For example, the findings of Hopker et al. (2010) informed this model\u000a      which was used by Sir Bradley Wiggins in his preparation for his Tour de\u000a      France and Olympic time trial victories in 2012.\u000a    Specifically, his science team identified the need to develop Wiggins'\u000a      cycling efficiency as a key target and focus of his preparation. As\u000a      described above, the findings from our laboratory have changed the way\u000a      scientists and coaches think about efficiency and the training necessary\u000a      to improve it. Indeed, a world leading sports scientist at the AIS has\u000a      noted that this work provides a fresh perspective on important issues and\u000a      that it has had a substantial impact on the way many nations prepare their\u000a      elite cyclists (see sources to corroborate impact).\u000a    Wider impact\u000a    The cycle racing and training models are having impact far beyond\u000a      professional cycling. Many people in gyms, health clubs and schools around\u000a      the world use the Wattbike ergometer for exercise and training.\u000a      Furthermore, aspects of the Cycle Training Model are being incorporated\u000a      into the \"Map My Tracks\" website which has over 450,000 users worldwide.\u000a      Map My Tracks provides GPS tracking on the web for people with GPS\u000a      tracking embedded in their mobile phones or other GPS-enabled devices. The\u000a      service is focused on sports enthusiasts who want to keep track of their\u000a      running, cycling, kayaking, and other such pursuits. Map My Tracks is a\u000a      product of Tinderhouse, a UK company based at the Innovation Centre,\u000a      University Road, Canterbury.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This impact case study describes the development and application of\u000a      models of training and performance in elite cycling.

Passfield has more than 20 years'\u000a      experience of applied work with Great Britain team cyclists and he\u000a      continued to work for British Cycling alongside his work for the\u000a      University of Kent. His research has been partly motivated by the insight\u000a      and challenges presented through this collaboration. A core focus of the\u000a      Endurance Research Group has been the training and performance of\u000a      competitive cycling, and Passfield and colleagues have investigated these\u000a      aspects from both a physiological and mathematical perspective.\u000a    Cycle Racing Model\u000a    The Cycle Racing Model, developed by Passfield at the University of Kent,\u000a      is the first comprehensive mathematical model of both cycle and rider in\u000a      the world. It represents a major development of all earlier work to\u000a      provide a complete detailed mechanical model of cycling. Once at the\u000a      University of Kent Passfield developed this detailed dynamic model using\u000a      Matlab and Simulink, in collaboration with Dr Martin Bailey and Dr Helen\u000a      Carter from the University of Brighton. This work formed the basis of\u000a      Patrick Cangley's PhD thesis for which Passfield was one of the\u000a      supervisory team. The new model builds on Passfield's previous modelling\u000a      research that utilised a single static equation of motion to predict\u000a      cycling performance. The new detailed model specifies separately aspects\u000a      of every major mechanical component of the bicycle and rider. Pedal torque\u000a      data is used to propel the model of bicycle and rider. Like a real bicycle\u000a      the model can be balanced and steered around any race route or track that\u000a      along with associated environmental conditions can be specified in detail.\u000a      The model calculates the necessary bicycle and rider mechanics and\u000a      corresponding cycling performance. The model has been validated\u000a      successfully both theoretically and against field data (Cangley et al.\u000a      2011, 2012). Subsequently, this new model has been used (and is continuing\u000a      to be used by British Cycling) to perform a range of \"what if\" scenarios\u000a      for various aspects of cycling competition and training.\u000a    Cycle Training Model\u000a    In 2008, Passfield (PI) and Dr Simon Jobson both at the University of\u000a      Kent used mathematical modelling to study the training process by\u000a      analysing the power output data obtained directly from the bicycles of\u000a      elite competitive cyclists. This project was funded by an EPRSC grant\u000a      under the \"UK Sports Achieving Gold\" call, and involved collaboration with\u000a      Prof Greg Atkinson and Dr Gabor Barton from Liverpool John Moores\u000a      University and Prof Phil Scarf from the University of Salford. Their work\u000a      resulted in the Sports Medicine review paper on the analysis and\u000a      utilisation of training data (Jobson et al. 2009) and inspired subsequent\u000a      work from the School's Endurance Research Group, such as Hopker et al.\u000a      (2010).\u000a    The Cycle Training Model represents a new approach to investigating\u000a      training because it reverses the normal method of scientific enquiry in\u000a      this area by studying the training process, rather than its outcomes. This\u000a      innovative approach has in turn enabled the Endurance Research Group to\u000a      gain fresh perspectives and challenge accepted training practice. For\u000a      example, with careful use of indirect calorimetry, our Endurance Research\u000a      Group was able to demonstrate repeatedly that cycling efficiency changes\u000a      with endurance training. Furthermore, using an elegant crossover design,\u000a      Hopker et al. (2010) demonstrated that it is high-intensity training, not\u000a      the widely-held moderate-intensity training, that is responsible for this\u000a      change. Our laboratory was the first to demonstrate this finding that has\u000a      changed widely adopted coaching principles.\u000a    Sprint Cycling Model\u000a    Further to the development of the Cycle Racing Model, in 2007 Passfield\u000a      (as a Co-I with Prof Phil Scarf, University of Salford) was also\u000a      successful in obtaining an EPSRC grant from the \"Achieving Gold\" scheme.\u000a      This grant provided funding to examine the use of mathematical modelling\u000a      to evaluate race tactics in track sprint cycling. The Sprint Cycling Model\u000a      uses logistic regression to calculate the probability of race winning\u000a      tactics. This analysis was derived from historical video footage from over\u000a      360 world-class sprint races. The model evaluates a range of different\u000a      race scenarios and calculates the likelihood of success associated with\u000a      them: for example, depending on the best and current speed of the cyclist,\u000a      and the race distance remaining, the model will calculate the probability\u000a      of winning associated with different race tactics such as whether to\u000a      follow, where and when to overtake, which position on the track to ride,\u000a      and so on. This work was embargoed before the London 2012 Olympics to gain\u000a      a competitive advantage over rival nations and is therefore only now under\u000a      peer review having been released for publication.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"747","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    By challenging conventional wisdom on the health legacy of sporting\u000d\u000a      mega-events, Pappous's findings have stimulated and informed public debate\u000d\u000a      in the UK and abroad.

The House Magazine wanted to provide Members of\u000d\u000a        Parliament and Peers with information about the legacy of the Athens\u000d\u000a      2004 Olympic Games in order to inform their debate on the potential legacy\u000d\u000a      of the London 2012 Olympic Games. The article entitled \"Lessons\u000a        from abroad: Hosting the Olympics does not necessarily lead to increased\u000d\u000a        grass roots sports participation\" was published in the 19th\u000d\u000a      of July 2012 issue of The House Magazine (see sources to corroborate\u000d\u000a      impact).\u000d\u000a    NIGERIA\u000d\u000a      Dr Pappous was invited to deliver a keynote talk in the context of the\u000d\u000a      18th National Sports Festival \"Eko 2012\" in Nigeria on the 22nd\u000d\u000a      of November 2012. This one-day event brought together international sports\u000d\u000a      administrators from different African nations including the Chief\u000d\u000a      Executive Officer of the 2010 South Africa FIFA World Cup, Danny Jordaan,\u000d\u000a      the Director of the Department of International Cooperation and\u000d\u000a      Development, International Olympic Committee (IOC), Ganda Sithole, and the\u000d\u000a      Minister of Sports\/Chairman of National Sports Commission (NSC) of\u000d\u000a      Nigeria, Bolaji Abdullahi.\u000d\u000a    The Nigerian Minister of Sports stated that, after listening to Dr\u000d\u000a      Pappous talk, he is \"now thinking to establish additional and specific\u000d\u000a      programs to improve the legacy of the National Sports Festival event in\u000d\u000a      Nigeria\" (see sources to corroborate impact).\u000d\u000a    COLOMBIA\u000d\u000a      In April 2013 Dr Pappous was invited to Colombia to present and discuss\u000d\u000a      the results of his study in a sport managers meeting attended by the\u000d\u000a      Vice-Director of COLDEPORTES Juan Carlos Penia Quintero.

He added that \"Dr Pappous research challenged the\u000d\u000a      assumptions and the high expectations when setting national targets of\u000d\u000a      sport participation legacies after a big event.

One of the key pledges set out in\u000d\u000a      the City of London's bid to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games was\u000d\u000a      to create a legacy of increased sports participation across the UK.\u000d\u000a      However, whilst there is much anecdotal evidence surrounding the legacy of\u000d\u000a      sporting mega-events for a host nation, there is scarce empirical evidence\u000d\u000a      to support it. The quantitative evidence that does exist is inconclusive\u000d\u000a      probably because national surveys of past hosts have been undertaken over\u000d\u000a      different time periods and for different purposes, so that the data are\u000d\u000a      not directly comparable.\u000d\u000a    Description of the underpinning research\u000d\u000a    The research underpinning this case study was carried out by Dr Sakis\u000d\u000a      Pappous as Senior Lecturer at the University of Kent in 2009. With this\u000d\u000a      research he aimed to address the lack of empirical evidence on the\u000d\u000a      long-term influence of sporting mega-events. His study involved a\u000d\u000a      secondary data analysis in order to determine whether there has been any\u000d\u000a      long-term increase in sports participation and physical activity in Greece\u000d\u000a      following the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. The analysis was based on\u000d\u000a      Eurobarometer surveys carried out in Greece over three different periods:\u000d\u000a      before the 2004 Games (2003), just after the 2004 Games (2004), and five\u000d\u000a      years after the 2004 Games (2009). The results of his analysis indicated\u000d\u000a      that, rather than producing a lasting increase, the Olympic Games in\u000d\u000a      Athens lead only to a temporary increase in sports participation and\u000d\u000a      physical activity in Greece. In fact, compared to pre-Olympic levels,\u000d\u000a      Pappous's analysis showed that the proportion of Greek people involved in\u000d\u000a      regular exercise increased from 10% in 2003 to 16% in 2004. However, this\u000d\u000a      increase in participation was not sustained and numbers plummeted to 3% by\u000d\u000a      2009.\u000d\u000a    Pappous's findings thus refute the conventional wisdom that presumes\u000d\u000a      sporting mega-events lead to health benefits for the host nation via an\u000d\u000a      increase in grassroots participation in sports and physical activity. His\u000d\u000a      findings suggest that, if a broader strategy promoting an active lifestyle\u000d\u000a      is not implemented, sporting mega-events will not sustain sports\u000d\u000a      participation. Instead, the sporting excitement may ultimately lead to a\u000d\u000a      `rebound effect', where participation drops to levels lower than during\u000d\u000a      the pre-event period.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1004","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aAcademic Enterprise and enhanced awareness of evidence based management of acute injuries\u000d\u000aacross a broad medical field\u000d\u000aThis body of work has been widely accessed by medical researchers and clinicians with online\u000d\u000astatistics show that our research has been downloaded to full text over 40,000 times.

A large percentage of musculoskeletal\u000d\u000ainjuries are incurred during sport and exercise. Currently, 50% of the Northern Ireland population\u000d\u000aparticipate regularly in sport; a figure that is set to increase in conjunction with the Northern Ireland\u000d\u000aStrategy for Sport and Recreation (2009-2019). Management in Accident and Emergency\u000d\u000aDepartments and Primary Care facilities has traditionally been limited to generic advice that\u000d\u000apromotes a conservative approach of protection and rest (PRICE). This encompasses a one size\u000d\u000afits all approach, with an emphasis on conservative treatment and rest.\u000d\u000aResearch findings by Bleakley (while working at Ulster) and colleagues have highlighted that time\u000d\u000ahonoured treatment approaches such as ice and compression may only be effective in certain\u000d\u000aclinical scenarios and are dose dependent.1-3 Furthermore, an active rehabilitation approach was\u000d\u000amost effective at enabling people back to functional activity after musculoskeletal injury.4 This\u000d\u000achallenges conventional wisdom by replacing conservative interventions and rest after injury, with\u000d\u000aan early, tailored and incremental rehabilitation programme.5-6 Our research has also developed\u000d\u000aevidence-based guidelines on the optimal dose of rehabilitation exercise and guidance on how this\u000d\u000ashould be tailored to clinical circumstances relating to injury severity, injury type and healing stage.\u000d\u000aWe have also summarised this approach using a new treatment acronym (P.O.L.I.C.E.: protection,\u000d\u000aoptimal loading, ice, compression and elevation).6\u000d\u000aThe research underpinning this impact was developed between 2008 and 2012 using a series of\u000d\u000aresearch approaches based on Cochrane reviews, randomised clinical studies, and Clinical\u000d\u000aGuidelines.

Physical inactivity has been estimated to cost the National Health\u000d\u000a      Service more than &#163;1.06 billion per year with physical inactivity being\u000d\u000a      responsible for more than 35,000 deaths each year in the UK. In America,\u000d\u000a      direct medical costs associated with physical inactivity were $76.6\u000d\u000a      billion in 2000. Emerging estimates from European studies suggest that\u000d\u000a      physical inactivity costs &#8364;300 per citizen per year. Consequently, many\u000d\u000a      countries advocate the development of national activity guidelines as part\u000d\u000a      of public policy and health services with a view to saving public money by\u000d\u000a      avoiding health care costs and increasing productivity through a healthier\u000d\u000a      population.\u000d\u000a    The research carried out by Professor Murphy and colleagues at Ulster\u000d\u000a      between 1998 and 2013 has unequivocally contributed to the scientific\u000d\u000a      evidence base underpinning the development of such national activity\u000d\u000a      guidelines (Sources 2, 3, 5 and 6).

(Source 1)\u000d\u000a    The significance of establishing that walking is a suitable physical\u000d\u000a      activity from which to derive health benefits should not be\u000d\u000a      underestimated. Public health policy guidelines are necessarily directed\u000d\u000a      at a considerable portion of the population who may be obese, sedentary,\u000d\u000a      at risk of cardiovascular disease and for whom more strenuous forms of\u000d\u000a      exercise may be unsuitable. Prior to Murphy's 1998 study the research\u000d\u000a      evidence for the health benefits of accumulated bouts of walking was\u000d\u000a      inconclusive. A key finding of this seminal research was to establish that\u000d\u000a      previously sedentary individuals who participate in short bouts of brisk\u000d\u000a      walking improve cardiovascular fitness and several other known risk\u000d\u000a      factors of cardiovascular disease.\u000d\u000a    The discovery by Murphy and colleagues that accumulated bouts of exercise\u000d\u000a      are as beneficial as one longer continuous bout has had an impact on\u000d\u000a      public policy initiatives by making physical activity more amenable to the\u000d\u000a      population as a whole by allowing it to fit more easily into busy lives.\u000d\u000a    A concomitant and complementary impact is evident by Murphy's direct\u000d\u000a      involvement in various international, national and local scientific and\u000d\u000a      advisory panels responsible for drafting public policy documents and\u000d\u000a      initiatives:\u000d\u000a    &#8212; Invited member of the scientific advisory group for the Department of\u000d\u000a      Health review of the current UK physical activity guidelines and a member\u000d\u000a      of the small editorial team which produced the 2011 guidelines issued by\u000d\u000a      the 4 Chief Medical Officers (DoH 2011 Start Active Stay Active - Murphy\u000d\u000a      responsible for writing adult guidelines).

Over a similar period public health recommendations for the\u000d\u000a      amount and type of physical activity have been developed to reflect our\u000d\u000a      understanding of the health benefits of exercise. These pronouncements\u000d\u000a      from government agencies (e.g. DoH), professional bodies (e.g. ACSM) and\u000d\u000a      authoritative global organisations (e.g. WHO) have attempted to delineate\u000d\u000a      the quantity and quality of physical activity required to gain the health\u000d\u000a      benefits associated with exercise. Successive refinements to these\u000d\u000a      guidelines have emerged, concomitant with evolving scientific research.\u000d\u000a      During the 1970s-80s vigorous-intensity exercise in the pursuit of\u000d\u000a      cardiorespiratory fitness was advocated. The 1990s witnessed a paradigm\u000d\u000a      shift by exploring the amount of physical activity necessary to produce\u000d\u000a      significant health benefits; with moderate-intensity exercise emerging as\u000d\u000a      sufficient to yield health benefits. Professor Murphy's work has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the evolution of the physical activity guidelines to\u000d\u000a      advocate accumulating short bouts of brisk walking as an effective means\u000d\u000a      of accruing the health benefits of physical activity.\u000d\u000a    Professor Murphy leads the Centre for Physical Activity and Health\u000d\u000a      Research. Her research has focussed on establishing the optimal type,\u000d\u000a      duration, and intensity of exercise required to elicit health benefits.\u000d\u000a      Results from her research, including randomised controlled trials,\u000d\u000a      systematic literature reviews, and meta-analysis, have directly\u000d\u000a      contributed to changes in public policy surrounding the health benefits of\u000d\u000a      exercise.1-6 Since 1998 Professor Murphy has contributed to\u000d\u000a      crucial research questions regarding the nature of the relationship\u000d\u000a      between physical activity and health, as well as being at the forefront of\u000d\u000a      international, national and local bodies responsible for the\u000d\u000a      transformation of such research into guidelines for physical activity. Two\u000d\u000a      unifying themes have underpinned this research: type of activity and\u000d\u000a      duration of activity bouts. In terms of the former, walking was identified\u000d\u000a      as an ideal activity because it is accessible to all, requires no skill,\u000d\u000a      has low injury risk, and has been identified as the most popular exercise\u000d\u000a      choice. Since `lack of time' is habitually cited as a barrier to physical\u000d\u000a      activity, a crucial issue was to investigate whether the established\u000d\u000a      health benefits of a single bout of continuous exercise could be\u000d\u000a      replicated by accumulating shorter bouts of the same intensity of exercise\u000d\u000a      throughout the day.1,4,5,6 Murphy's work has made a substantial\u000d\u000a      contribution to the evidence base for walking as a cornerstone of physical\u000d\u000a      activity promotion internationally and her seminal work in accumulated\u000d\u000a      bouts of walking6 has resulted in her being regarded as a\u000d\u000a      leading research authority in this area.\u000d\u000a    Murphy's research findings on accumulated exercise and the role of brisk\u000d\u000a      walking for health benefit provides evidence that healthy but sedentary\u000d\u000a      individuals undertaking a programme of regular brisk walking will improve\u000d\u000a      a range of cardiovascular disease risk factors.1,2,4,5,6\u000d\u000a      Moreover, self-selected walking speeds have been shown to effectively\u000d\u000a      increase fitness in this population.3 This research programme\u000d\u000a      has contributed to the evidence base underpinning physical activity\u000d\u000a      guidelines in the UK, Ireland and the USA, in addition to being cited in\u000d\u000a      the Canadian and Australian guidelines.1,5,6 Specifically,\u000d\u000a      these guidelines now include a recommendation for activity accumulated in\u000d\u000a      bouts of 10 minutes or more and a specific reference to the role of\u000d\u000a      walking at a moderate to vigorous intensity activity and cite Murphy's\u000d\u000a      work as an important part of the evidence base for this recommendation.1,6\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, worldwide recognition of her research has precipitated\u000d\u000a      Murphy's invitation onto various national and international scientific and\u000d\u000a      advisory panels responsible for devising public policy documents where the\u000d\u000a      evidence base for walking and\/or accumulated exercise is being examined.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2807","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The team's research into Osteoarthritis was first reported in a paper\u000d\u000a      published in The Knee in 2004 that led to subsequent development\u000d\u000a      of \"proofs of concepts\" through to our current work. This led to the\u000d\u000a      development of new methods of movement analysis and biomechanical\u000d\u000a      modelling techniques that we are now using in our current work. With a\u000d\u000a      mission to improve the quality of life of patients treated by Allied\u000d\u000a      Health Professionals, our work pursues this goal by performing basic and\u000d\u000a      applied research, and by developing new techniques in the assessment of\u000d\u000a      musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. The team also advises medical\u000d\u000a      staff on methods of conservative management of knee pain through invited\u000d\u000a      talks to clinical groups internationally.\u000d\u000a    The applied clinical nature of the work is firmly rooted in the every-day\u000d\u000a      world of clinical practice. Although some of the tools used in this\u000d\u000a      research are very advanced and only available in specialist research units\u000d\u000a      the focus has always to be to produce results that are clinically useful.\u000d\u000a      When considering clinical utility the aim is to provide clinicians with\u000d\u000a      evidence about patient management or new tools to assist in patient\u000d\u000a      management. By helping to optimise clinical practice the health and\u000d\u000a      well-being of patients attending for conservative management of\u000d\u000a      musculoskeletal conditions is improved.\u000d\u000a    The findings of the research team suggest that there are many benefits in\u000d\u000a      terms of joint stability and control that had gone previously undetected\u000d\u000a      which had led many clinicians to doubt the therapeutic benefit of some\u000d\u000a      conservative management. The research team at the University of Central\u000d\u000a      Lancashire has now developed a program of work to systematically assess\u000d\u000a      the effectiveness of different levels of conservative and surgical\u000d\u000a      management. The effect of surgical management of knee osteoarthritis using\u000d\u000a      total knee arthroplasty was initially tested by Dr Dominic Thewlis (a\u000d\u000a      former PhD student and now a senior lecturer of University of South\u000d\u000a      Australia). This has now been followed up by considering a spectrum of\u000d\u000a      conservative and surgical managements to give comparative guidance of what\u000d\u000a      biomechanical and clinical outcomes clinicians could expect.\u000d\u000a    Dissemination of these research findings has been to academic and\u000d\u000a      professional conferences but often, more importantly, through specific CPD\u000d\u000a      activities which are particularly effective at influencing clinical\u000d\u000a      practice. Some of this research has been translated into other languages\u000d\u000a      including Persian, Flemish and Chinese, and is cited by other\u000d\u000a      international research groups. It appears that a wide international\u000d\u000a      audience of clinicians and academics have been influenced.\u000d\u000a    From this research evidence base key members of staff have delivered\u000d\u000a      expert advice to clinical groups in Europe (1995 onwards), USA (2007\u000d\u000a      onwards), China (2010 onwards) and South East Asia (2011 onwards), South\u000d\u000a      America (2012 onwards), and receive invitations to speak at conferences\u000d\u000a      worldwide on a regular basis. This has included over 150 invited talks to\u000d\u000a      clinical groups, professional sports clubs, commercial companies, academic\u000d\u000a      groups in over 20 different countries between 2008 and 2013. This\u000d\u000a      dissemination has helped the acceptance of conservative treatment before\u000d\u000a      surgical management in Europe and the US and is now being used throughout\u000d\u000a      China and South East Asia, which has improved the clinical options of\u000d\u000a      Allied Health Professionals and Orthopaedic Surgeons. This has led to more\u000d\u000a      than 1,000 patients worldwide now receiving conservative management for\u000d\u000a      Knee Osteoarthritis and Patellofemoral pain since 2010 as a direct result\u000d\u000a      of this work who would not of otherwise been treated conservatively\u000d\u000a      (source DJO Global inc.).

In addition\u000d\u000a      our work on patellofemoral pain was the first to determine the\u000d\u000a      biomechanical effects on the three dimensional movement and control of the\u000d\u000a      knee when using taping and bracing in 2008. This work highlighted\u000d\u000a      improvements in the knee control, and in collaboration with colleagues at\u000d\u000a      the University of Manchester (Dr Mike Callaghan &amp; Prof Jackie Oldham)\u000d\u000a      we have established that patellofemoral patients demonstrate clinically\u000d\u000a      important proprioceptive deficits (2008), therefore identifying the\u000d\u000a      possible proprioception and mechano-reception mechanism through which\u000d\u000a      these treatments work.

One example of this\u000d\u000a      came from our research on the exploration of the biomechanics of squatting\u000d\u000a      tasks and their implications for lower limb rehabilitation. Single-limb\u000d\u000a      squats on a decline angle have been suggested as a rehabilitative\u000d\u000a      intervention to target the knee extensors, however very little empirical\u000d\u000a      research exists documenting the optimum angle of decline. Our work\u000d\u000a      explored the use of squatting using decline boards and aimed to determine\u000d\u000a      the optimum angle and the most effective regimen. Our paper, published in\u000d\u000a      the Journal of Athletic Training (Richards et al, 2008), was the first to\u000d\u000a      determine the biomechanics of such exercises, and suggests the optimum\u000d\u000a      angles for different rehabilitation purposes. This work led to the\u000d\u000a      development of a new rehabilitation device, the \"Rehab Angel\", which\u000d\u000a      allows the decline angle to be adjusted based on our findings. This device\u000d\u000a      is now commercially available and is being used in many rehabilitation\u000d\u000a      centres and professional sports clubs in a variety of knee and other lower\u000d\u000a      limb pathologies.\u000d\u000a    Our research has also supported the development and product testing of\u000d\u000a      many new devices that aim to reduce pain and improve function.

The focus of the\u000a      research has always been to be producing results that are patient focused\u000a      and clinically useful. We have challenged existing clinical paradigms and\u000a      helped to optimise clinical practice by focussing on previously\u000a      unrecognised clinically important factors associated with local\u000a      circulatory disturbance. This has improved the health and well-being of\u000a      patients attending clinics for conservative management of sports injuries\u000a      and general musculoskeletal conditions. Our publication strategy has\u000a      targeted journals that are credible academically and also widely accessed\u000a      and read by clinical colleagues from a diverse variety of health and\u000a      sports professions. We have also significantly impacted on clinical\u000a      practice internationally through our Continuing Professional Development\u000a      (CPD) activities that have highlighted to practitioners the importance of\u000a      circulatory disturbance and the use of cooling products. Since 2006 our\u000a      group has been invited to deliver in excess of 30 keynote lectures and CPD\u000a      sessions throughout the UK and Scandinavia (Finland, Denmark, Sweden) on\u000a      the assessment of the `cold' sub-group of patellofemoral patients and on\u000a      the results of our \"efficacy of cryotherapy\" studies. These sessions cover\u000a      a broad spectrum of health and sports practitioners and locations from\u000a      Rehabilitation Centres in rural Finland through to the English Institute\u000a      of Sport in Manchester. We have also built in local public-engagement\u000a      activities. For example, we have demonstrated some of our thermal-imaging\u000a      techniques and presented our scientific results to over 2,000 school\u000a      children and members of the public at the 2010 &amp; 2011 Lancashire\u000a      Science Festivals. In addition we have also used the thermal imaging\u000a      camera as part of an outdoor public display at the January 2011 Charity\u000a      `Firewalk'. One of the key drivers that motivates my research work is in\u000a      understanding the `Real World of Clinical Practice' and informing\u000a      practitioners and the public about that work.\u000a    We have taken a significant leading role in both of the International\u000a      Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreats (2010; 2012) and will be\u000a      co-hosting\/organising the next retreat in 2015. The mission of these\u000a      International Research Retreats was to bring together scientists and\u000a      clinicians from around the world who were conducting research aimed at\u000a      understanding the factors that contribute to the development and,\u000a      consequently, the treatment of PFP. We contributed a number of formal\u000a      presentations of our research at each of the Consensus Conferences and we\u000a      were also active participants in developing the consensus statements. The\u000a      consensus statements play a significant role in guiding clinical practice\u000a      around the world and have provided clinicians with a new clinical paradigm\u000a      with which to assess and manage PFP. The conference proceedings and the\u000a      Consensus Statements that were formulated at each conference have been\u000a      published in the internationally influential Journal of Orthopaedic and\u000a      Sports Physical Therapy, which is read by practitioners around the world.\u000a    In addition to our work on PFP, our studies on the efficacy and safety of\u000a      Cryotherapy modalities has contributed to the development of the PRICE\u000a      Guidelines (2010), in which three of our papers are cited. These\u000a      guidelines provide detailed practical information on the clinical\u000a      application of PRICE and facilitate clinicians in critical reflection on\u000a      the pathophysiological rationale for using PRICE. The guidelines were\u000a      developed through extensive systematic review and rigorous critical\u000a      appraisal of original research and consensus from an international, expert\u000a      group of clinicians and academics. The executive summary of the PRICE\u000a      guidelines has been distributed to all members of the Association of\u000a      Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports Medicine, approximately 1,600\u000a      clinicians.\u000a    In recognition of my impact on the physiotherapy profession I was awarded\u000a      a Fellowship in 2008. \"It is recommended that a Fellowship of the\u000a        Chartered Society of Physiotherapy be conferred upon Professor James\u000a        Selfe for his outstanding contribution to musculoskeletal physiotherapy,\u000a        particularly in the field of patello-femoral pain dysfunction for which\u000a        James is known internationally as a leading authority.

PFP is the most\u000a      common overuse injury of the lower extremity, and is particularly\u000a      prevalent in those who are physically active; approximately 2.5 million\u000a      runners will be diagnosed with PFP in a given year. However despite being\u000a      common PFP is a very difficult condition to treat successfully; a recent\u000a      prospective study reported that at 5 year follow up, 80% of patients still\u000a      had pain and 74% had restricted their activity levels. Clearly in the long\u000a      term, the traditional multimodal management strategies currently employed\u000a      for this condition are not working. In the short term the traditional\u000a      multimodal approach can also be inefficient by wasting therapeutic effort\u000a      and patient time in addressing factors that are not actually contributing\u000a      to the patient's condition. The change in paradigm that involves\u000a      identifying specific patient sub-groups means that clinicians can now\u000a      provide targeted intervention for a precise problem, which leads to\u000a      improved patient outcomes. Our work in this field has specifically\u000a      focussed on the assessment and treatment of a `cold' sub-group where the\u000a      predominant problem relates to painful ischaemia associated with poor\u000a      local circulation, which manifests clinically as a `cold' knee. Our work\u000a      in the field of sub-grouping and targeted intervention is recognised by\u000a      our significant contributions to the International Patellofemoral Pain\u000a      Research Retreats (2010; 2012).\u000a    Efficacy and Safety\u000a    We have also used our anatomically based method to define a region of\u000a      interest for post- thermal imaging analyses to investigate skin\u000a      temperature response to a variety of low cost localised cryotherapy\u000a      interventions such as Frozen Peas and Gel Packs which patients and health\u000a      care professionals can apply in domestic environments. We have also\u000a      investigated more specialised clinically oriented local cooling systems\u000a      such as CryoCuff and Arctic Flow. In particular we have been interested in\u000a      assessing efficacy i.e. whether any of these cooling modalities actually\u000a      reduce skin temperature by a therapeutically useful amount. Significantly,\u000a      we found that Gel packs were actually capable of producing an excess of\u000a      cooling that resulted in a transient superficial skin burn. This work on\u000a      the efficacy and safety of local cooling systems has been referenced in\u000a      the PRICE Guidelines (2010): Guidelines for the management of soft tissue\u000a      (musculoskeletal) injury with Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression and\u000a      Elevation (PRICE) during the first 72 hours. This guideline was originally\u000a      published in 1998 and is highly respected and used by clinicians around\u000a      the world. This first revision of the guideline in 2010 represents a\u000a      significant advance on the original as it summarises evidence from over\u000a      250 high quality research studies and provides new research to underpin\u000a      the conservative management of acute soft tissue injury.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2809","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As indicated in section 2 relevant impact relates to two national sport\u000d\u000a      museums in England and Australia, referred to by the respective\u000d\u000a      abbreviations NFM and NSM.

Hughson's research on\u000d\u000a      Nevinson's painting Any Wintry Afternoon in England (1930) was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in this artwork being sought by the NFM for a period of\u000d\u000a      temporary exhibition from October 2013. The painting, normally located in\u000d\u000a      the Manchester City Art Gallery, was released for public display to the\u000d\u000a      NFM for a period of one year. Upon the unveiling of the painting at the\u000d\u000a      NFM, on 23 October 2013, Hughson gave a welcoming public address, drawing\u000d\u000a      upon his research, to speak of the painting's cultural significance. The\u000d\u000a      display of this painting within the NFM serves an educative role by\u000d\u000a      bringing the painting to the attention of a section of the public that may\u000d\u000a      not otherwise see it in the more conventional location of an art gallery.\u000d\u000a      Hughson's research, with Kevin Moore, into the symbolic significance of\u000d\u000a      the football shirt worn by Diego Maradona during the controversial\u000d\u000a      semi-final match between Argentina and England at the 1986 FIFA World Cup\u000d\u000a      Finals in Mexico has informed the way in which the shirt is now displayed\u000d\u000a      within the NFM since its relocation to Manchester. The shirt, on permanent\u000d\u000a      loan to the NFM from its owner, former England player Steve Hodge, was\u000d\u000a      that worn by Maradona when he scored two of football's most famous goals,\u000d\u000a      commonly known as `the hand of God' and the `goal of the century'.\u000d\u000a      Developed in a way pertinent to a popular audience, the display signage\u000d\u000a      draws on the argument in the research regarding the `polysemantic' nature\u000d\u000a      of shirt, i.e. it is interpreted differently according to the cultural\u000d\u000a      positioning of the viewer. The aspects of Hughson's research pertaining to\u000d\u000a      clothing resulted in an invitation to guest edit and write the\u000d\u000a      introductory essay to a special issue of the academic journal Costume.\u000d\u000a      This, in turn, led to an invitation to join the advisory committee for the\u000d\u000a      NFM's touring exhibition `Strike a Pose: 50 Years of Football and\u000d\u000a      Fashion'. Two further aspects of Hughson's research within the monograph The\u000a        Making of Sporting Cultures have had an impact outcome in relation\u000d\u000a      to the NFM. His discussion in the book of the relevance and justification\u000d\u000a      of the NFM being located within the Northwest of England informed the\u000d\u000a      decision-making at the subsequent time when discussion was held regarding\u000d\u000a      the relocation of the Museum from Preston to Manchester - rather than\u000d\u000a      London. Hughson's research in The Making of Sporting Cultures in\u000d\u000a      regard to the identification of heroes within the history of sport has\u000d\u000a      underpinned his appointment by the NFM as a historian adviser to the\u000d\u000a      selection panel for the National Football Hall of Fame. The impact in this\u000d\u000a      regard involves Hughson's recommendations for players of the pre-WWII and\u000d\u000a      immediate post-war era for induction to the Hall of Fame being put to the\u000d\u000a      selection committee, made up of famous football players, for their final\u000d\u000a      deliberations on an annual basis. In September 2013 the NFM became the\u000d\u000a      only sport museum and collection to receive `Designation' status from the\u000d\u000a      Arts Council England. Hughson's active research engagement with the\u000d\u000a      Museum's collection was highlighted within the successful documentation\u000d\u000a      submitted in the application. Hughson's research on Olympic posters, as\u000d\u000a      outlined in section 2, had an impact benefit in regard to the Call to\u000d\u000a        the Games: Olympic Posters exhibition held at the NSM during the\u000d\u000a      time that London staged the Olympic Games in 2012. Hughson's research\u000d\u000a      impacted upon the way that school and public educational information was\u000d\u000a      prepared for the exhibition and during July\/August 2012 Hughson visited\u000d\u000a      the NSM for a three week period as an honorary research consultant, during\u000d\u000a      which time he gave two public lectures on Olympic posters based on his\u000d\u000a      research and pertaining to the exhibition.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken by Hughson has impacted on the decision-making of two\u000d\u000a      museums, principally the National Football Museum (NFM) in England and the\u000d\u000a      National Sports Museum (NSM) in Australia. In the NFM, research has\u000d\u000a      informed the acquisition and display of items for the permanent collection\u000d\u000a      and temporary exhibition, led to an appointment as historical advisor to\u000d\u000a      the selection committee of the National Football Hall of Fame, and has\u000d\u000a      also supported the NFM's successful bid for `Designation' status with the\u000d\u000a      Arts Council.

Five published\u000d\u000a      peer reviewed works contain this research; the bibliographical details are\u000d\u000a      set out in section 3 of this document. The first three of the listed items\u000d\u000a      are included within Hughson's four published items returned with REF 2014.\u000d\u000a      Hughson's research expertise on sport within art was established in the\u000d\u000a      monograph The Making of Sporting Cultures. In various chapters of\u000d\u000a      the book, the representation of sportive movement and symbolism from the\u000d\u000a      ancient to the modern - Myron's Discobolus to Dali's Cosmic\u000d\u000a        Athlete - is discussed. This demonstrated expertise has been\u000d\u000a      instrumental in Hughson giving advice to the NFM on the acquisition and\u000d\u000a      display of artwork (elaboration on actual impacts in regard to each piece\u000d\u000a      of published research is set out in section 4 below). Hughson has\u000d\u000a      published the first detailed art historical case study of the painting Any\u000a        Wintry Afternoon in England (1930) by C.R.W. Nevinson, highlighting\u000d\u000a      the painter's critical ambition for the regard of football within this\u000d\u000a      artwork. The research has directly informed the temporary acquisition and\u000d\u000a      display of this painting within the NFM. Hughson (with K. Moore) has\u000d\u000a      published detailed research on the cultural and historical significance of\u000d\u000a      the shirt worn by Diego Maradona in the 1986 FIFA World Cup semi-final\u000d\u000a      match between Argentina and England. The said shirt is an item held by the\u000d\u000a      NFM and the published research paper has impacted upon its display. One of\u000d\u000a      the chapters in Hughson's published monograph The Making of Sporting\u000d\u000a        Cultures, `The Modern City and the Making of Sport', included a\u000d\u000a      discussion of the NFM and its significance within a regional cultural\u000d\u000a      policy context. This chapter was informative to discussions about the\u000d\u000a      on-going location of the museum within the Northwest of England and the\u000d\u000a      subsequent decision taken in that regard. Another chapter in The\u000d\u000a        Making of Sporting Cultures titled `On Sporting Heroes' has further\u000d\u000a      established Hughson's expertise on identifying criteria on the basis of\u000d\u000a      which sports heroism is established. This research relates to Hughson's\u000d\u000a      appointment as an historical advisor to the selection panel for the\u000d\u000a      English Football Hall of Fame (administered by the NFM). During the REF\u000d\u000a      census period Hughson published two research papers on the cultural\u000d\u000a      significance of officially commissioned posters prepared for Olympic\u000d\u000a      Games' - one paper discussing the importance of the posters in\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the sport\/art relationship invested in the modern Olympic\u000d\u000a      Games by Baron de Coubertin; the other presenting a dedicated case study\u000d\u000a      of the modernist poster for the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, designed by\u000d\u000a      Richard Beck. In combination this research had an impact upon the\u000d\u000a      exhibition of the history of Olympic posters held at the National Sport\u000d\u000a      Museum in Melbourne during 2012 when the XXX Olympiad was held in London.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3880","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research from the Unit has helped to \"...create, within the space of just\u000a      a few years, an entirely new product in sports nutrition, one supported by\u000a      objective evidence and material that can be used for educational purposes\"\u000a      as confirmed by the Operations Manager for QNT UK Ltd (letter sent 2nd\u000a      November 2012).\u000a    The Units research provides evidence that the impact of beta-alanine to\u000a      sporting\/exercise performance ranges between 2 and 30%, depending upon the\u000a      individual, the event and the situation. Consequently, beta-alanine\u000a      supplementation is now internationally recognised as a significant new\u000a      player in relation to the athlete's nutritional toolkit. According to the\u000a      Physiology Lead, Canadian Sport Centre-Pacific it provides a healthy and\u000a      legal enhancement of athletic performance. As such, further impact has\u000a      been enabled through influencing the awareness, practice and performance\u000a      of elite athletes worldwide, through the engagement of elite athletes and\u000a      key practitioners within our research. For example, the Physiology Lead,\u000a      Canadian Sport Centre-Pacific (Source 2) goes on to state (in a letter\u000a      supplied 1st March 2013) that SHAPEs research has, \"...substantially\u000a        progressed our understanding of the efficacy behind beta-alanine.....of\u000a        the nearly 300 athletes at the 2012 London [Olympics], I would estimate\u000a        that about 100 athletes have used beta-alanine at some point in\u000a        the preparations\". Similar evidence is provided by the former Head\u000a      of Performance Nutrition at the English Institute of Sport (Source 3) who\u000a      states (letter supplied 18th June 2013) that \"The research\u000a        produced and published by this group of researchers was incorporated\u000a        into the training programme and strategies used by GB athletes in the\u000a        lead up to and during the most recent 2010 Commonwealth and 2012 Olympic\u000a        and Paralympic Games.....\"\u000a    The specific use of SHAPE research on beta-alanine to support UK based\u000a      athletes was explained by the current Head of Performance Nutrition at the\u000a      English Institute of Sport (Source 4), letter supplied to SHAPE, 27th\u000a      June 2013) who confirmed that the outcomes of the research from Ref 2 have\u000a      been used to support the use of beta-alanine in Rugby, Hockey and with the\u000a      England Cricket Team. Similarly, the outcomes from Ref 6 have been used to\u000a      support the use of beta-alanine across a range of sports including GB\u000a      short track speed skating, canoe slalom and GB swimming and Ref 1 has\u000a      supported the use of beta-alanine in combination with sodium bicarbonate\u000a      with GB short track speed skating and synchronised swimming.\u000a    In addition to the use by Canadian and GB athletes, there is also\u000a      evidence of impact delivered in Australia and New Zealand. Evidence for\u000a      this is supplied by the Head of Sports Nutrition at the Australian\u000a      Institute of Sport (Source 5) who confirms (letter dated 2nd\u000a      June 2013) that, \"We have benefitted from the publications and\u000a        presentations that have been produced, as well as the generous insights\u000a        we have gained via direct communication with Dr Sale...Based on Dr\u000a        Sale's research, and work of our own, we have implemented protocols of\u000a        use of 03b2-alanine by AIS athletes. We are also aware of its use by\u000a        many other sports programs that value evidence-based supplement uses.\"\u000a      Similarly, the Lead Performance Nutritionist, High Performance Sport New\u000a      Zealand (Source 3) states (letter dated 18th June 2013) that\u000a      our research has \"....led to the development of effective nutritional\u000a        interventions to assist and support sports performance....beta alanine\u000a        supplementation is presently being used to support athletes in New\u000a        Zealand High Performance Sport system in training, and\/or competition in\u000a        sports such as Athletics, Cycling, Rowing, Triathlon, Hockey, Rugby, and\u000a        selected winter sports at the elite level....\"\u000a    The Units research has also led to significant impact in Rugby where the\u000a      Rugby Football Union of Wales (confirmed by a letter from the WRU National\u000a      Squad Nutritionist dated 30th October 2012) and the England\u000a      Woman's 7s team (confirmed by a letter from the Lead Performance\u000a      Nutritionist with the English Institute of Sport, 2nd May 2013)\u000a      have used it to develop beta-alanine strategies during key training\u000a      phases. It has also informed the content of a pre-game formula used by\u000a      some premiership football clubs (confirmed by the Director of Pro Athlete\u000a      Supplementation Ltd in a letter dated 30th October 2012). To\u000a      further develop impact, we disseminate findings directly to the athletes\u000a      and practitioners ahead of the outputs of our research findings, which can\u000a      often incur significant delay in publication time, as highlighted above.\u000a      For example, this has helped nutritionists and athletes to develop their\u000a      strategies, for the women's Rugby 7s World Cup in June 2013 and\u000a      preparation for the 15s World cup in 2014 (confirmed by a letter from the\u000a      Lead Performance Nutritionist with the English Institute of Sport, 2nd\u000a      May 2013).\u000a    It is evident through our research and that of our collaborators (some\u000a      informed by our work) that beta-alanine is a nutrient previously\u000a      overlooked. The persistence of our research group has helped to establish\u000a      it as a worldwide sports nutrition product. To confirm this, the United\u000a      States imported around 350,000 kg of beta-alanine annually in 2008, which\u000a      has dramatically increased to around 800,000 kg in 2010, 2012 and 2013 and\u000a      the global production of beta-alanine for use as a dietary supplement has\u000a      increased dramatically from 2008 (figures supplied by Natural Alternatives\u000a      International, San Marcos, California, US; July 2013).\u000a    One of the additional ways our research has helped to develop the use of\u000a      beta-alanine as a new dietary product is its use in marketing and\u000a      promotional material by those commercial companies selling the products.\u000a      As the Operations Manager for QNT UK Ltd states (letter dated 2nd\u000a      November 2012) \"A good example of the synergy between academia and\u000a        industry.....has been the research carried out by Nottingham Trent\u000a        University on beta-alanine, and also the publication of leading review\u000a        articles on this topic by this group.\" Further support for our role\u000a      in this comes from the Global Head of Performance Nutrition Research and\u000a      Development at Nestle (Source 1) who reports (letter dated 11th\u000a      July 2013), \"Nestle currently markets beta-alanine products globally\u000a        under two different sub-brands, PowerBar and Musashi...In fact,\u000a        information from Craig's studies have been incorporated into some of our\u000a        communication materials used with sports nutrition practitioners.\"\u000a      Similarly, the Director of Pro Athlete Supplementation Ltd confirms that\u000a      (letter dated 30th October 2012) \"Pro Athlete\u000a        Supplementation developed a pre-game formula that contains Beta Alanine\u000a        and has been widely used by premiership football clubs and international\u000a        rugby teams. Helping to market this is a study from Nottingham Trent\u000a        University to be published by the International Journal of Sports\u000a        Nutrition later this year, which demonstrates its effectiveness in a\u000a        test designed to replicate football specific exercise capacity.\"\u000a    To summarise, the research undertaken within the Unit in relation to\u000a      beta-alanine supplementation has had very significant impact and reach and\u000a      provides an excellent example of the potential for synergy between\u000a      academia, industry and the end user.

This has created a new research stream relating to the\u000a      co-supplementation of these buffering agents, with numerous papers from\u000a      our research group and others relating specifically to this. Furthermore,\u000a      we have shown significant effects of beta-alanine supplementation on basic\u000a      exercise tests, including isometric exercise capacity of the knee\u000a      extensors (Sale et al., 2012, JISSN, 9, 26. DOI:\u000a      10.1186\/1550-2783-9-26) and, following confirmation of beta-alanine's\u000a      effects on different exercise models, we have extended the scope of our\u000a      studies to show effects on sport specific tests. These include soccer\u000a      specific exercise capacity (Ref 2), 2000m rowing (Ref 3) and\u000a      collaboratively on swimming performance (Painelli et al., 2013, APNM,\u000a      38, 525-532.

Of particular relevance to the\u000a      athlete, we have also shown, in a collaborative study, similar effects of\u000a      beta-alanine in trained versus untrained participants. Just as\u000a      importantly, we have published data to show where beta- alanine has not\u000a      been successful in improving sport performance (Ref 4).\u000a    In addition to our original research, we have been instrumental in\u000a      providing information on the efficacy of beta-alanine supplementation for\u000a      exercise performance through the production of one of the first review\u000a      papers on the topic (Ref 5) and the only meta-analysis to date (Ref 6).\u000a      Further reviews (Harris et al., 2012, Amino Acids, 43, 39-47.

These summary outputs,\u000a      alongside industry specific publications (e.g., Sale and Saunders,\u000a      2012, Professional Strength and Conditioning, 27, 26-31), are\u000a      critical in engaging with applied practitioners and have helped SHAPE to\u000a      be at the forefront of applied research in this area.\u000a    Evidence of our contribution to the international debate on the\u000a      importance of beta-alanine supplementation, is provided by Dr Sale's\u000a      inclusion on the Scientific Committee of the International Congress on\u000a      Carnosine in Exercise and Disease at the University of Ghent in Belgium\u000a      (Derave and Sale, 2012, Amino Acids, 43, 1-4. DOI:\u000a      10.1007\/s00726-012-1281-3), where he presented a keynote lecture on the\u000a      ergogenic potential of beta-alanine. Dr Sale remains on the International\u000a      Scientific Committee for the 2014 Congress planned to be held in Tokyo,\u000a      Japan. Significant international collaborations have been developed, most\u000a      notably with the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and the University of\u000a      Ghent (Belgium).\u000a    To summarise, research from SHAPE has led to the identification of the\u000a      range of influences of beta-alanine supplementation on exercise\u000a      performance and capacity. It should also be noted that our research has\u000a      been the catalyst for the research of other groups worldwide on\u000a      beta-alanine alone and in combination with other supplements (e.g.,\u000a      sodium bicarbonate). As evidence of the level of our research and the\u000a      regard with which it is held in by the International community, the CEO of\u000a      the International Society of Sports Nutrition states \"...I would like\u000a        to offer my support and recognition of the excellent scientific work\u000a        performed at Nottingham Trent University...Beta-alanine has been\u000a        shown to be of incredible importance in the athletic arena and has\u000a        clearly shown to enhance both the sports world and the world of academic\u000a        research.......With 15 full papers published in the most distinguished\u000a        of scientific journals, the Nottingham group has made significant\u000a        strides in the understanding of sports performance vis a vis\u000a        beta-alanine...The research group at Nottingham is perhaps the most\u000a        distinguished in the world in the field of beta-alanine research.\"\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4940","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research has outlined the importance of environmental aspects (e.g.,\u000a      access to green space)\u000a      and engaging with communities as important drivers in behaviour change.\u000a      The impact of our work\u000a      is seen in the positive changes in health behaviours of people from\u000a      deprived communities resulting\u000a      from research initiatives which address community engagement and\u000a      environmental aspects;\u000a      sustainable changes after the research was completed; engagement with\u000a      stakeholders to influence\u000a      practice and policy and dissemination through media coverage.\u000a    Our intervention work on the Natural England Funded ProGreSS project\u000a      reported improvements in\u000a      the 250 residents' perceptions of the park and antisocial behaviour, which\u000a      reflected a real\u000a      reduction, based on police data over a 12 month period [3, 8]. This is\u000a      illustrated in the quote of one\u000a      resident who said \"I'm not sitting here, watching my window in case they\u000a      come throw eggs at me. I\u000a      haven't done that for a good 12 months now since you started all this\u000a      kicking it all off. I think it's\u000a      marvellous and it's made our life a lot better.\" [8].\u000a    In the `My Health Matters' (MHM) project 18,308 people received health\u000a      promotion information;\u000a      there were 11,525 attendances at community events, and of these 1,678\u000a      subsequently engaged on\u000a      a regular basis in community events (e.g., regular attendance at physical\u000a      activity sessions).\u000a      Community engagement is evidenced in that during the project 45 volunteers\u000a      and 15 community\u000a      champions were engaged and along with 102 partners ranging from large\u000a      companies (e.g., B&amp;Q;\u000a      Co-Op), service providers (e.g., Citizens Advice Bureau), local charities,\u000a      local media and schools\u000a      [9]. Levels of physical activity and healthy eating improved in the three\u000a      deprived areas where the\u000a      intervention took place, and increased social capital was also observed\u000a      [9]. The positive change in\u000a      health behaviours is reflected in quotations from the residents who\u000a      mentioned \"every session has\u000a      been fun and I have done more exercise now than I have done before\" and\u000a      \"before I did My Health\u000a      Matters ... I wouldn't even try to eat or try a piece of fruit or veg, but\u000a      now ... I eat different fruits and\u000a      veggies and things I thought I would never try.\" [9].\u000a    The sustainability of our impact is evidenced in that the three full time\u000a      community development\u000a      workers funded by the MHM project have had their contracts extended by\u000a      Stoke-on-Trent City\u000a      Council [9,10]. Further this work has now been expanded from the three\u000a      deprived areas as part of\u000a      the original MHM project to up to 18 areas across Stoke-on-Trent [10,11]\u000a      under a new My\u000a      Community Matters scheme (MCM). A change in the environment is evidenced\u000a      in that the\u000a      previously underutilised local assets, such as community centres, and\u000a      allotments, have been\u000a      developed into fully functioning community hubs staffed by community\u000a      groups which, with the\u000a      support of the MHM project and other partners, have been successful in\u000a      receiving further funding\u000a      (&#163;60,000) to develop community provision [9,10]. We continue to support\u000a      the evaluation of\u000a      community developments work in the city through a part-funded PhD\u000a      scholarship (half-funded by\u000a      Staffordshire University and half-funded by NHS Stoke-on-Trent) of the new\u000a      MCM scheme [10,11].\u000a      The sustainability of our impact is also evidenced in the changes in the\u000a      physical infrastructure\u000a      resulting from the ProGreSS Project, such as opening up densely wooded\u000a      parts of the park and\u000a      introducing a new play area [8].\u000a    Our impact is also evident in our work with stakeholders to influence\u000a      practice and policy. The\u000a      findings of the MRC-funded National Preventive Research Initiative [1, 5,\u000a      12] that both environment\u000a      and engaging with communities at the individual level were identified as\u000a      important drivers in\u000a      behaviour change provided an important stimulus that led to the formation\u000a      of the Healthy Public\u000a      Policy Group [13]. This was a collection of key stakeholders from\u000a      academia, local authority and the\u000a      NHS to ensure that health and lifestyle were considered in local policy\u000a      and action (e.g., proposed\u000a      planning developments), and providing a sustainable mechanism for\u000a      University researchers to\u000a      influence local action. This group ran until 2013. The work of this group\u000a      will now form a part of the\u000a      new proposed Centre for Research and Action on Health Inequalities (CRAHI)\u000a      a joint initiative\u000a      between Staffordshire County Council, Stoke-on-Trent City Council,\u000a      Staffordshire University and\u000a      Keele University, due for launch in 2014. This new Centre will be based at\u000a      Staffordshire University\u000a      and over the next three years will administer a budget of ~&#163;1 million\u000a      provided by Staffordshire\u000a      County Council and Stoke-on-Trent City Council. Continued work with the\u000a      city council has\u000a      culminated in the establishment of a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) Peer\u000a      Review service within\u000a      the Centre for Sport, Health and Exercise Research, whereby developers\u000a      wishing to build in Stoke-\u000a      on-Trent must submit an HIA, and we provide a quality assurance service\u000a      [14]. Data from the MRC\u000a      and MHM projects has also influenced policy, with data highlighting issues\u000a      relating to health and\u000a      urban planning in the city that stimulated the production of a\u000a      supplementary planning document for\u000a      Stoke-on-Trent City council [15].\u000a    Our expertise has also been recognised by involvement in a major project\u000a      in which we continue to\u000a      develop a social-ecology approach promoting healthy living with emphasis\u000a      on environmental\u000a      aspects and community engagement. We play a leading role in the PHENOTYPE\u000a      research\u000a      project: a four-year, &#8364;3.5 million, European project to explore links\u000a      between the natural\u000a      environment and health.

The approach to healthy\u000a      living has focused on health\u000a      improvement through physical activity, healthy eating and engagement with\u000a      the natural\u000a      environment.\u000a    The impacts reported in this case study flow from research ongoing since\u000a      2006. We began with a\u000a      project funded through the MRC National Preventive Research Initiative\u000a      [1,2,5] in which attitudes\u000a      to, and engagement in, physical activity and health outcomes were mapped\u000a      in deprived inner-city\u000a      communities. The data highlighted that the majority of residents (~65%) in\u000a      these communities were\u000a      not physically active, but were not ready, or interested, in changing\u000a      their behaviour [1,2]. Analysis\u000a      of individual and area-level physical activity correlates enabled us to\u000a      identify a need to improve\u000a      both environmental factors, such as access to quality green space, and to\u000a      engage with\u000a      communities at the individual level in order to effect sustainable\u000a      behaviour change. It is these key\u000a      findings that has guided our subsequent initiatives to improve health\u000a      behaviours, and has led to\u000a      two notable initiatives.\u000a    In 2008 we embarked on a Natural England funded project (ProGreSS) to\u000a      engage residents of\u000a      deprived urban communities with local green space [6]. We engaged with the\u000a      community and local\u000a      partners to increase use of a four-hectare public park. Physical site\u000a      improvements and community\u000a      events were undertaken and follow-up data outlined improvements in\u000a      residents' perceptions of the\u000a      park and antisocial behaviour, which reflected a real reduction based on\u000a      police data [3,4].\u000a    In 2009 we secured funding for a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) in\u000a      partnership with NHS\u000a      Stoke-on-Trent and delivered a large scale community-led intervention to\u000a      reduce health\u000a      inequalities relating to physical activity and healthy eating [7].\u000a      Specifically we aimed to improve\u000a      attitudes to, and engagement in, health-enhancing activities in deprived\u000a      communities. Three full-\u000a      time community development workers were employed to deliver the project\u000a      and each was\u000a      allocated to a deprived area in Stoke-on-Trent to facilitate the\u000a      development of interventions defined\u000a      by community members. This bottom-up, community-led approach developed a\u000a      wide range of\u000a      activities, including physical activity classes (e.g., zumba, aerobics)\u000a      and community healthy cook\u000a      and eat sessions. We also built on findings from the Natural England\u000a      ProGreSS project regarding\u000a      the importance of green space quality (not just quantity) and activities\u000a      that can take place there,\u000a      and provided events to promote community use of local green space (e.g.,\u000a      community picnics,\u000a      community allotments). Pre-post intervention data demonstrated that levels\u000a      of physical activity and\u000a      healthy eating improved in the three areas, with concurrent increases in\u000a      social capital.\u000a    Collectively this research has resulted in eight papers, 15 conference\u000a      presentations and has been\u000a      supported by three completed funded projects, and one which is ongoing.\u000a      Our research was begun\u000a      by Professors Davey and Cochrane who left in January 2010 to move to the\u000a      University of Canberra\u000a      and have continued to work as collaborative partners. Since January 2010\u000a      the work has been led\u000a      by Associate Professor Chris Gidlow and supported by Professor Marc Jones.\u000a      It has also been\u000a      conducted in collaboration with NHS Stoke on Trent and Stoke-on-Trent City\u000a      Council.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4942","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of our research is in the use by sports teams, sports\u000d\u000a      governing bodies and organisations of stress management programmes\u000d\u000a      underpinned by the Theory of Challenge and Threat States (TCTSA), and\u000d\u000a      where possible enhanced by the protocol for assessing cardiovascular\u000d\u000a      responses to the psychological stress. In our typical protocol we have\u000d\u000a      collected data using impedance cardiography. Baseline data is collected\u000d\u000a      while players relax (e.g., for five minutes) and then a psychological\u000d\u000a      stressor is introduced. For example players may be told they are about to\u000d\u000a      take part in an important task and to prepare themselves for that task, or\u000d\u000a      they may be asked to imagine what it would be like to be faced with a\u000d\u000a      psychologically stressful scenario. It is the change from baseline in\u000d\u000a      cardiac output and total peripheral resistance that indicates a challenge\u000d\u000a      or threat state. Players are provided with individual feedback on whether\u000d\u000a      their cardiovascular responses indicated a challenge or threat state along\u000d\u000a      with suggestions of how stress can be viewed more positively (if\u000d\u000a      appropriate). These suggestions are based on the TCTSA which outlines that\u000d\u000a      athletes who feel confident, in control and are focused on what can be\u000d\u000a      achieved (rather than avoiding failure) will respond to situations in a\u000d\u000a      challenge state. The benefit of this approach is that it provides an\u000d\u000a      objective measure of athletes' responses to psychological stress that\u000d\u000a      predicts performance [3, 4] and is grounded in a theory outlining how\u000d\u000a      these responses can be changed [2]. This type of assessment eliminates the\u000d\u000a      social desirability inherent in self-report measures given that an\u000d\u000a      individual may be reticent to admit concern or doubts about a specific\u000d\u000a      event to a significant other (e.g., coach or psychologist) in case it is\u000d\u000a      interpreted as a sign of weakness.\u000d\u000a    In the work with the players at Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club\u000d\u000a      Academy and Senior Team [6] and the England under 19 cricket squad we have\u000d\u000a      tested to date &gt;80 players. This includes four separate testing\u000d\u000a      sessions at Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and three sessions with\u000d\u000a      the England under 19 cricket squad. Data were collected on\u000d\u000a      psycho-physiological responses to being told they were about to take part\u000d\u000a      in a batting test [see 4 for a description of our initial work]. After\u000d\u000a      data were collected each player received individual feedback and\u000d\u000a      suggestions for dealing with psychological stress. If required a longer\u000d\u000a      term intervention was developed for the player. Work using this protocol\u000d\u000a      is still ongoing at Nottinghamshire Country Cricket Club and further coach\u000d\u000a      education and mentoring reinforce the concepts in the TCTSA. Specifically\u000d\u000a      coaches aim to enhance confidence, feelings of control and an approach\u000d\u000a      focus in players during training sessions and in preparation for games.\u000d\u000a      These concepts have also been disseminated through the wider cricket\u000d\u000a      coaching community to &gt;40 coaches through coach education sessions (run\u000d\u000a      annually since 2010) for Nottinghamshire county coaches.\u000d\u000a    In our testing with academy players at Stoke City Football Club during\u000d\u000a      the 2012-2013 season, we tested 35 players from the U21, U18 and U16\u000d\u000a      squads. Data were collected on psycho- physiological responses to\u000d\u000a      imagining a stressful scenario (i.e., making a debut for the first team).\u000d\u000a      Each player received individual feedback and suggestions for dealing with\u000d\u000a      psychological stress based on the TCTSA. There is further testing planned\u000d\u000a      during the 2013-2014 season [7]. The incorporation of innovative sport\u000d\u000a      science initiatives, such as this, contributed to Stoke City achieving\u000d\u000a      Category 1 Academy status in 2012 and the sport science provision\u000d\u000a      receiving the maximum possible score [8]. The impact of category one\u000d\u000a      status is significant, within the context of the Premier League's Elite\u000d\u000a      Player Performance Plan, as it indicates that an optimal infrastructure is\u000d\u000a      in place to help develop the young soccer player.\u000d\u000a    We have also conducted educational sessions based on the TCTSA that has\u000d\u000a      not involved collecting cardiovascular data, with squads including the\u000d\u000a      Staffordshire County Cricket Club Emerging Player Program, Nottingham\u000d\u000a      Forest Football Club Academy, and the British Equestrian Federation-Elite\u000d\u000a      Performance Squad.\u000d\u000a    The interest in this approach is growing in the sporting community and\u000d\u000a      the Great Britain Senior Rowing Team have funded testing for all 60 of the\u000d\u000a      senior squad to take place in 2014 [9]. In consultation with the Head of\u000d\u000a      Sport Science and Medicine, and National Performance Psychologist a\u000d\u000a      protocol specific to rowing has been developed. First, each athlete will\u000d\u000a      outline a hierarchy of Olympic Games stressors. The greatest stressor\u000d\u000a      identified will be used as the stressor from which psychological and\u000d\u000a      cardiovascular data will be collected, using a protocol similar to that\u000d\u000a      employed with the academy players at Stoke City Football Club (i.e., the\u000d\u000a      stressor is imagined). The stressors used will differ across the rowers,\u000d\u000a      so the data collected will be relevant to each individual rower. For\u000d\u000a      example, one rower may be concerned about changing boats close to\u000d\u000a      competition, another may be concerned about an upcoming World\u000d\u000a      Championships and the influence this may have on selection. Each rower\u000d\u000a      will receive a profile on how they respond to that stressor and if\u000d\u000a      necessary guidance on developing a challenge response. The rowers will be\u000d\u000a      tested on at least four occasions in the period in the lead up to the Rio\u000d\u000a      2016 Olympic games to monitor progress. We are also planning to use a\u000d\u000a      similar protocol with the England Futsal team in the 2013-2014 season and\u000d\u000a      apply it to an England age-group international football team specifically\u000d\u000a      relating to helping players develop a challenge approach to penalty\u000d\u000a      shoot-outs [10]. A similar protocol will also be used with Great Britain\u000d\u000a      Shooting during 2014.\u000d\u000a    The impact of our work has broadened out beyond sport to be applied in\u000d\u000a      training days at companies and third sector organisations. The TCTSA has\u000d\u000a      underpinned training delivered for Sony Europe and Sony Mobile since 2010.\u000d\u000a      This includes training delivered as part of the senior leadership\u000d\u000a      development programme within Sony Europe (2010, 2011). It also underpinned\u000d\u000a      a training and development programme comprising five sessions delivered to\u000d\u000a      25 staff for dealing with the stress of change in the workplace\u000d\u000a      (2012-2013). The success of these sessions has meant that Sony Europe have\u000d\u000a      asked for input in the European Graduate Training Programme along with\u000d\u000a      further input into in-house training programmes, including the development\u000d\u000a      of software for mobile devices on stress management and leadership [11].\u000d\u000a      We have also used the TCTSA to underpin training sessions delivered to\u000d\u000a      business leaders at the North Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce and as\u000d\u000a      part of the `Leadership Cafe' to managers at the South Staffordshire and\u000d\u000a      Shropshire Health Care NHS Foundation Trust. Staffordshire University has\u000d\u000a      also funded research (&#163;4,868) beginning in January 2014 to explore the use\u000d\u000a      of this protocol to help students deal with the psychological stress of\u000d\u000a      examinations. This will be a similar protocol to that used in sport\u000d\u000a      whereby data will be collected on students' psycho-physiological responses\u000d\u000a      to the exam (e.g., imagining sitting the examination) and if needed, in\u000d\u000a      line with the TCTSA suggestions around enhancing confidence, control and\u000d\u000a      an approach focus will help students develop a challenge approach to the\u000d\u000a      psychological stress of the examination.\u000d\u000a    The impact of this work is evidenced in dissemination through public\u000d\u000a      engagement events and invited talks. Jones has disseminated his research\u000d\u000a      on challenge and threat states using the Olympics as a context at\u000d\u000a      prestigious public science festivals (British Science Festival 2012;\u000d\u000a      Cheltenham Science Festival 2012, 2013). Jones has also outlined how\u000d\u000a      understanding challenge and threat responses to psychological stress may\u000d\u000a      be relevant to osteopaths in an invited talk at the College of Osteopaths\u000d\u000a      Annual Conference (2013), while Turner addressed a similar topic to\u000d\u000a      chiropractors in an invited talk at the British Chiropractic Association\u000d\u000a      Annual Conference (2013). Barker has presented this research as part of a\u000d\u000a      session on dealing with psychological stress to coaches at the Great\u000d\u000a      Britain Archery Sport Forum (2013).\u000d\u000a    Collectively we have engaged with individual athletes (&gt; 100), and\u000d\u000a      coaches; we influence practice through engagement with professional clubs\u000d\u000a      and national governing bodies; and disseminated through public engagement\u000d\u000a      events and invited talks. This novel and exciting approach to dealing with\u000d\u000a      psychological stress has been warmly received by the sporting and business\u000d\u000a      communities and is evidenced in the amount of work planned that builds on\u000d\u000a      our impact to date.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    We have developed, and applied, an approach to help athletes view the\u000d\u000a      psychological stress of competition as a challenge (positive) rather than\u000d\u000a      a threat (negative). This approach either has been, or is shortly to be,\u000d\u000a      used in professional football, professional cricket, international rowing,\u000d\u000a      international Futsal, as well as being applied to the workplace and in\u000d\u000a      education.

Initially our research was\u000d\u000a      focused on understanding and controlling psychological and emotional\u000d\u000a      responses to sport competition [1]. In 2007 we began to explore\u000d\u000a      psycho-physiological responses to competition and embarked on the\u000d\u000a      development and testing of a Theory of Challenge and Threat States in\u000d\u000a      Athletes (TCTSA) [2]. In the TCTSA, responses to psychological stress are\u000d\u000a      conceptualised as positive (challenge) or negative (threat), and these two\u000d\u000a      states are indicated by differing cardiovascular responses to\u000d\u000a      psychological stress. It is the change in two cardiovascular variables in\u000d\u000a      response to a psychological stressor that is key to this approach. The two\u000d\u000a      variables are cardiac output (the amount of blood being pumped out of the\u000d\u000a      heart per minute) and total peripheral resistance (measure of the overall\u000d\u000a      resistance in the vasculature). Specifically, a challenge response to a\u000d\u000a      psychological stressor is indicated by an increase in cardiac output and a\u000d\u000a      decrease in total peripheral resistance, whereas a threat response in\u000d\u000a      indicated by little or no change in cardiac output and an increase in\u000d\u000a      total peripheral resistance [2]. The TCTSA outlines that athletes who feel\u000d\u000a      confident, in control and are focused on what can be achieved will respond\u000d\u000a      to competition in a challenge state, whereas those who have low\u000d\u000a      confidence, lack control and are focused on avoiding failure will respond\u000d\u000a      to competition with a threat state.\u000d\u000a    We have demonstrated that the cardiovascular responses associated with a\u000d\u000a      challenge state are associated with better performance, than\u000d\u000a      cardiovascular responses associated with a threat state, in cognitive\u000d\u000a      (modified stroop test) and motor (netball shooting) tasks [3]. Similar\u000d\u000a      findings have been observed in elite cricketers who took part in a task\u000d\u000a      designed to assess their batting ability [4]. We have also looked\u000d\u000a      critically at the underpinning theory and tested the relationship between\u000d\u000a      cardiovascular responses to psychological stress and self-reported\u000d\u000a      psychological states and found that often the relationships are unclear\u000d\u000a      [3, 4] or contrary to what is expected [5]. While self-reported\u000d\u000a      psychological states have not always aligned with cardiovascular responses\u000d\u000a      as predicted, manipulating psychological states does change cardiovascular\u000d\u000a      responses in line with the TCTSA. In our research we have demonstrated, in\u000d\u000a      two separate studies, that enhancing self-efficacy, control and an\u000d\u000a      approach focus in participants before a competitive task does lead to\u000d\u000a      cardiovascular responses indicative of a challenge state (paper currently\u000d\u000a      under review).\u000d\u000a    Emerging from our research has been the development of a protocol for use\u000d\u000a      with athletes that has been utilised by professional and national sports\u000d\u000a      teams. Specifically, we collect data on changes in cardiovascular\u000d\u000a      responses from rest when athletes are presented with a psychologically\u000d\u000a      stressful scenario (e.g., a young football player asked to imagine what it\u000d\u000a      would be like to make a debut for the first team).This protocol provides\u000d\u000a      an objective way of assessing how an athlete may respond to an upcoming\u000d\u000a      competition to complement other methods such as interview or\u000d\u000a      questionnaires that may be subject to socially desirable responses. This\u000d\u000a      assessment is then used, if required, as the basis for interventions with\u000d\u000a      the athletes to help them develop a challenge approach to competition.\u000d\u000a    Collectively the research programme focused on helping athletes deal\u000d\u000a      with, and perform, under psychological pressure has yielded &gt;40 papers,\u000d\u000a      &gt;40 conference presentations and has been supported by six PhD students\u000d\u000a      who have completed. The research was begun by Professor Marc Jones,\u000d\u000a      supported by Associate Professor Jamie Barker, Dr Paul McCarthy (Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology, left in June 2009) Dr Martin\u000d\u000a      Turner and Matthew Slater.

UKAD Chief\u000a      Executive Andy Parkinson writes \"This research assisted UKAD in\u000a      understanding the tolerance to doping activity and how this changed as\u000a      athletes sporting careers progressed, providing a useful insight into the\u000a      psychology and mind sets of the next generation of athletes.\" He also\u000a      noted how the research was \"essential in developing our understanding,\u000a      cumulating in the development of a `Doping Signature' model.\" This model\u000a      can be used to help identify particularly vulnerable athletes prior to\u000a      their making decisions to dope. Parkinson writes that the model arose from\u000a      the research and was utilized as a tool they use with sports stakeholders\u000a      (e.g. national sports federations) to \"communicate these risks to the\u000a      sporting landscape. At the recent industry conference, the Clean Sport\u000a      Forum (November 2012), this model was presented and unanimously accepted\u000a      by the audience of over 80 representatives from a wide range of UK\u000a      sporting organisations and Universities\".\u000a    International Impact\u000a    In recognition of McNamee's corpus of published research he was invited\u000a      to prepare peer- reviewed educational materials, and give presentations to\u000a      international congresses for anti doping personnel in Seoul (November,\u000a      2010). Among delegates were 60 heads\/representatives of anti doping from\u000a      30 NADOs. His invitation to talk to key Asian stakeholders at the Chinese\u000a      National Anti Doping Organization (CHINADA)\/WADA Gene and Cell Doping\u000a      Symposium focused on social aspects of Anti Doping policy, with particular\u000a      reference to the Spirit of Sport (R5 and R6). The Vice President, WADA \/\u000a      President of the IOC Medical Commission, writes that he requested R6,\u000a      having heard it presented in Doha, at an international Anti Doping\u000a      conference and that he used it to \"help prepare for the Executive Board\u000a      meeting of WADA, which agreed the final revisions of the WADA Code to be\u000a      ratified at the November 2013 meeting in South Africa\".\u000a    He also writes: \"Professor McNamee's article clearly laid out the logic\u000a      for maintaining WADAs 2 from 3 stance (performance enhancement or harm to\u000a      health or against the spirit of sport) on anti- doping substances and\u000a      methods. His arguments were a significant foil against the move to\u000a      downgrade the spirit of sport criterion, and therefore to underwriting the\u000a      logic of anti- doping policy.\" The re-instatement of three equal criteria\u000a      for Anti Doping Rule Violations is evidenced in the 3rd and\u000a      final WADA Code Review Version at (http:\/\/www.wada-ama.org\/Documents\/World_Anti-Doping_Program\/WADP-The-Code\/Code_Review\/Code%20Review%202015\/WADC-2015-draft-version-3.0.pdf)\u000a      Equally the Science Director at WADA writes of the invited presentations\u000a      noted above that: \"in the context of gene therapy and gene doping and the\u000a      relevance of Prof McNamee's comments and perspectives were highly\u000a      appreciated by the audiences, in particular from the anti-doping experts\u000a      attending these two meetings. In addition, in the current context of the\u000a      revision of the World Anti-Doping Code, Prof McNamee's reflections on the\u000a      importance of the spirit of sport criterion in the overall considerations\u000a      regarding identification of substances or methods prohibited in sport was\u000a      of significance. He contributed to strengthen the debate and ultimately to\u000a      maintain the current balanced position between the three existing criteria\u000a      (performance enhancement, protection of health and spirit of sport).\u000a      Generally speaking, in the symposia referred to above, as well as in his\u000a      recent publications on this specific subject, Prof McNamee significantly\u000a      contributed to placing ethical considerations as one of the key elements\u000a      in the reflections supporting anti-doping policy making a practical impact\u000a      in the applications of anti-doping rules under the auspices of the World\u000a      Anti-Doping Code.\"\u000a    Moreover, based on R5 and R6, McNamee was solicited to write an\u000a      accessible article for the WADA magazine, Play True, on the subject of the\u000a      \"Spirit of Sport\" that was distributed to all National Anti Doping\u000a      organizations worldwide. The Medical Director of WADA, writes about this\u000a      article: \"Professor McNamee's discussions on ethics and the spirit of\u000a      sport have been particularly timely as this Code is being reviewed and we\u000a      wrestle with such crucial dilemmas such as inclusion criteria for List of\u000a      Prohibited Substances and Methods.\" He continues: \"Professor Mike McNamee\u000a      has been involved in numerous projects with WADA. His writings, whether\u000a      from published articles or work specifically commissioned by WADA\u000a      education purposes (the WADA Physician Toolkit) have been of great value\u000a      in our efforts to educate athletes and physicians.\" (see http:\/\/library.wada-ama.org\/results.php#\/item\/000000011019098\/view)\u000a    Given his work for the G3, McNamee was invited to present findings\u000a      (January, 2011) to the 6th Annual EU Anti Doping Working Group comprising\u000a      all heads of NADOs in Europe. He subsequently became a member of the newly\u000a      formed European Commission Expert Group on Recreational Doping, which\u000a      submitted recommendations for an EC declaration. The Head of the EC\u000a      Education and Sport Unit writes: \"the impact of the research directed by\u000a      Professor McNamee on EU-level policy development has been consistent and\u000a      considerable\" and that \"the Sport Unit has been in close contact with\u000a      Professor McNamee and found him to be a valuable source of information and\u000a      inspiration.\"\u000a    Finally, in the wake of the Lance Armstrong scandal, UCI commissioned\u000a      McNamee to address all Directors of the Professional Tours (December,\u000a      2012) in their annual meeting. This meeting is normally restricted to\u000a      heads of professional teams and their representatives that comprise the\u000a      elite level of world cycling. In this arena McNamee raised key ethical\u000a      issues that UCI and Professional teams needed to address regarding the\u000a      cultures of anti doping in professional cycling. He was invited to the\u000a      subsequent (March, 2103) stakeholder meeting - Anti Doping Working Group -\u000a      including representatives from professional cyclists, professional teams,\u000a      TV sport media, International Tour Event Organisers.

A highly important finding was the influence of shame that would\u000a      be felt from a doping offence as a significant deterrent to doping\u000a      decisions, which highlighted the educational importance of the influence\u000a      of significant others in shaping the formation of negative attitudes\u000a      towards doping.\u000a    Building upon these data, R3 focused on ethical issues regarding how\u000a      confidential athlete information was mediated by team doctors and other\u000a      healthcare professionals (known as Athlete Support Personnel [ASP]).\u000a      International inter-sport inconsistencies in the governance of and\u000a      sanctioning by National Anti Doping Organizations (NADOs) and\u000a      International Sports Federations in relation to ASP are highlighted in R4\u000a      (which is the product of collaboration with Anti Doping personnel in\u000a      Austria and Serbia).\u000a    R5 is an unpublished, though publicly available, research study report,\u000a      funded by the European Commission Framework 7 Programme (with nine\u000a      European university partners), pertaining to the non\/utilisation of\u000a      ethical expertise in policy making concerning human enhancement practices\u000a      in European societies (not limited to sports). The report was disseminated\u000a      widely among Directors of WADA and heads of NADOs and presented to various\u000a      international anti doping meetings arranged by WADA whose aim regarding\u000a      these invited presentations was to influence agendas in Asia and the\u000a      Middle East. The study, conducted between 2010-12, comprised 41 in depth\u000a      qualitative interviews with key global stakeholders in Anti Doping,\u000a      including nearly all Directorate personnel at WADA, and 12 heads of\u000a      European NADOs, and 5 heads of Medicine\/Science within them. This\u000a      investigation demonstrated a) the need for ethical expertise to be used to\u000a      better interpret and apply the criteria by which doping methods and\u000a      substances are determined, b) the lack of ethical expertise on the\u000a      Prohibited List Committee, and c) the need to better understand the\u000a      principle of the Spirit of Sport in Anti Doping policy.\u000a    Most notably, R6 arose from the European Commission funded project and is\u000a      a complex ethical argument against a proposed change (set out in the 2nd\u000a      draft revised code for WADA in 2013) in the policy and practice for the\u000a      determination of doping substances and methods. It discusses the role of\u000a      cannabinoids on the Prohibited List, and argues against the medicalization\u000a      of Anti Doping, which would have arisen if the policy changes advocated in\u000a      the second stage of revisions to the WADA Code had been accepted. It is\u000a      specifically mentioned in the letters from Prof Ljungqvist (Vice\u000a      President) and Dr Rabin (Medical Director), at WADA, for its global\u000a      impact.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5902","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research is concerned with identifying optimal pre-competition\u000a      strategies that can be exploited for performance gain by elite\u000a      sportspeople.

This research has explored three key areas of athlete\u000a      pre-competition preparation; 1) practical application of PAP, 2) warm-up\u000a      manipulation, and 3) the effect of morning exercise on subsequent\u000a      performance. The ability to produce high levels of muscular power is\u000a      considered an essential component of success in many sports (e.g. sprint\u000a      cycling, skeleton and bobsleigh, rugby) and a number of pre-competition\u000a      routines can be manipulated in the hours leading up to competition to\u000a      ensure athletes are optimally prepared for competition.\u000a    Current research has produced conflicting results on athletes' ability to\u000a      harness PAP. This conflict has been explained by the lack of agreement\u000a      between studies on optimal recovery time required between the preload\u000a      stimulus and the subsequent sporting activity with studies reporting\u000a      recovery periods ranging from 0 to 18.5 minutes. The focus of this\u000a      research was to determine how best to apply PAP to the current preparation\u000a      routines of elite sportspeople to improve their performance. Our research\u000a      concluded that on average 8 minutes recovery was required between the\u000a      preload stimulus and subsequent performance to optimise the benefits of\u000a      PAP (R1). This research has been replicated within our group and expanded\u000a      to show that PAP can be harnessed to improve sprinting performance (R2).\u000a      The references detailed above have formed the foundations for the\u000a      incorporation of PAP into pre-competition routines in a number of elite\u000a      winter and summer Olympic sports.\u000a    The second series of our studies (R2-R5) have reported two strategies to\u000a      attenuate the reported decline in body temperature following the\u000a      completion of the athlete's warm-up. A number of sports have significant\u000a      periods of time that athletes must wait between the completion of their\u000a      warm-up and start of competition, during this period the athletes muscle\u000a      temperature rapidly drops, losing a large proportion of the physiological\u000a      benefits that go with increases muscle temperature. Our research has shown\u000a      that completing the warm-up as close as practically possible (within the\u000a      constraints of the sports regulations, e.g., swimmers must enter a\u000a      marshalling call room 20 minutes prior to racing) to the start of the\u000a      competition helps maintain body temperature and this maintenance leads to\u000a      improvements in performance (R3, R4). Secondly research conducted at\u000a      Swansea has demonstrated that getting athletes to wear passive heat\u000a      maintenance garments in the period between the completion of their warm-up\u000a      and the subsequent performance leads again to better temperature\u000a      maintenance and hence greater improvements in performance (R3, R5).\u000a    The final study (R6) demonstrated that a bout of morning exercise managed\u000a      to attenuate the normal circadian decline in the key anabolic hormone and\u000a      this led to a significant improvement in afternoon performance.\u000a    The research outlined above was conducted in elite sporting populations\u000a      in conjunction with UK Sport and has led to publications in journals that\u000a      are leading in their respective fields.

For example, the consensus statement was used by a team in\u000a      Germany, who then\u000a      conducted the largest survey of diagnosis, assessment and intervention\u000a      methods for children with\u000a      DCD based on the criteria identified in the Leeds Consensus Statement.\u000a      Their findings were then\u000a      published as the Swiss-German guidelines in 2011 [F].\u000a    Beyond its initial impact in establishing a new working definition and a\u000a      new universal standard in\u000a      the diagnosis and assessment of DCD, the research also continues to inform\u000a      debate. Together\u000a      with the improved professional practices as a result of the Leeds\u000a      Consensus Statement, the\u000a      research findings are captured again in an updated version of the\u000a      Consensus in 2012 [E], led by\u000a      the European Academy for Childhood Disability [D]. These\u000a      guidelines will continue to help ensure\u000a      consistency in the way that DCD is diagnosed, as well as informing future\u000a      intervention strategies.\u000a      This has been recognised by a number of agencies as demonstrated by the\u000a      quote below.\u000a      \"There is detailed guidance and discussion about assessment and diagnosis\u000a      which has been very\u000a      useful in supporting clinicians working out in the field in DCD clinics [G]\u000a      Occupational Therapist, The Children's Trust, UK.\u000a    Impact on health and welfare\u000a      DCD is a common disorder affecting motor coordination in 4 - 6 % of\u000a      children in the UK, and has a\u000a      significant, negative impact on activities associated with daily living,\u000a      such as dressing, eating,\u000a      riding a bicycle, academic achievements, and thus limits the social and\u000a      economic opportunities\u000a      available to children with this disorder.\u000a    Research about DCD is not nearly as comprehensive as other developmental\u000a      disorders, such as\u000a      dyslexia, ADHD and autism spectrum disorders. Detailed assessment of\u000a      co-ordination problems,\u000a      early in the life of a child with DCD, enables children to be given\u000a      support and appropriate\u000a      intervention.

Features of DCD show high\u000a      levels of overlap with other\u000a      developmental disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity\u000a      disorder (ADHD), dyslexia and\u000a      autism spectrum disorders, and confusion in assessment, diagnosis and\u000a      consequently intervention\u000a      causes barriers to progress and appropriate treatment. Following initial\u000a      attempts in 1994 to develop\u000a      a consensus statement (known as the London Consensus Statement), which\u000a      highlighted the\u000a      existence of DCD, there was a substantial increase in awareness of the\u000a      disorder. This resulted in\u000a      increasing demands for an updated version of the consensus to reflect\u000a      current research and\u000a      professional practice, to offer clinicians and practitioners a better\u000a      understanding of DCD, to aid\u000a      more accurate identification, diagnosis and assessment, and to inform more\u000a      targeted intervention.\u000a    As a result of Utley's detailed experimental work on children\u000a      with movement difficulties, and\u000a      because of Utley, Sugden and Chambers' theoretical, empirical and\u000a      professional knowledge of\u000a      movement analysis in children, the University of Leeds team secured an\u000a      ESRC grant to develop an\u000a      updated and revised consensus in 2005. The ESRC grant enabled Utley,\u000a      Sugden and Chambers\u000a      to bring together other leading professionals, from health, psychology,\u000a      education and sports\u000a      science, between 2004 - 2005, to gain agreement for a new consensus\u000a      statement regarding the\u000a      condition DCD. In the discussions raised by contributors, it was agreed to\u000a      retain the term DCD and\u000a      to propose new recommendations, guidelines for assessment and new general\u000a      intervention\u000a      principles, informed by research and the evidence based understanding of\u000a      children with DCD [1].\u000a    Research by Utley, which had positioned her as an expert in this\u000a      field, contributed to the 2006\u000a      consensus agreement in two key ways. Firstly, Utley's research\u000a      helped determine exactly how\u000a      children with DCD move during standardised tasks and the nature of their\u000a      movement difficulties.\u000a      Using detailed analytical methods, such as kinematic analysis, Utley\u000a      led efforts to define the\u000a      fundamental movement strategies of children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) or\u000a      DCD [2, 3], which\u000a      proved to be of diagnostic value, for example the coupling of limbs to\u000a      assist with control [2, 4].\u000a    Secondly, Utley's research has also addressed the issue of\u000a      rehabilitation considering the role of\u000a      the task, the environment, and the individual in the rehabilitation\u000a      process. The fundamental\u000a      movement analysis of children with DCD (and CP) identified critical\u000a      features of the disorder(s) and\u000a      successful interventions that were helpful in completing manual tasks such\u000a      as reaching and\u000a      grasping and catching [2 - 5]. The performance of manual tasks,\u000a      such as catching an object,\u000a      requires the coordination of multiple, independent parts of the body\u000a      (individual muscles, joints,\u000a      limbs). Children with DCD perform many coordination tasks poorly and\u000a      strategies that link some of\u000a      these variables (e.g. joints), reduce the degrees of freedom in the system\u000a      and simplify the task and\u000a      improve its execution [2, 5, 3]. The research of Utley and\u000a      colleagues demonstrated the importance\u000a      of context on movement, namely the shape, size, weight and texture of an\u000a      object [4, 6, 2].\u000a      Crucially, Utley and colleagues addressed the issue of movement in\u000a      DCD from a different\u000a      theoretical stance: a dynamical systems perspective which considered the\u000a      process of movement\u000a      production rather than the outcome [5, 3]. The importance of using\u000a      different modes of information\u000a      to influence movement was a pivotal finding which has been widely applied\u000a      in rehabilitation. This\u000a      approach is reflected in the strategies for intervention which are central\u000a      to the Leeds Consensus\u000a      Statement. The quality of this research resulted in publications in top\u000a      journals such as Motor\u000a        Control and Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology,\u000a      which previously had not published\u000a      research on DCD.\u000a    Thresholds were identified for each parameter to achieve discrimination\u000a      between different\u000a      movement disorders (separating DCD from CP, and ADHD for example),\u000a      contributing to the clinical\u000a      definition of DCD and the identification of several diagnostic traits and\u000a      tests to diagnose the\u000a      condition in patients. The research also evaluated intervention strategies\u000a      and produced guidelines\u000a      for successful intervention\/rehabilitation.\u000a    Researchers:\u000a      Dr Andrea Utley, Co-Investigator, Reader in Motor Control and\u000a      Learning, University of Leeds\u000a      (2000-present)\u000a      Prof David Sugden, Co-Investigator, Professor Special Needs in Education,\u000a      University of Leeds\u000a      (1987-present)\u000a      Dr Mary Chambers, Co-Investigator, Lecturer, University of Leeds\u000a      (2002-present)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6374","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Ichiyama's work provided the foundation for the development of a\u000d\u000a      clinical intervention that has\u000d\u000a      been demonstrated to restore standing and stepping in paralysed patients.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, a detailed\u000d\u000a      rehabilitative strategy developed at Leeds from 2007 (i) established the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness and safety in\u000d\u000a      animals of a particular regime of epidural stimulation, locomotor training\u000d\u000a      and drugs and (ii) provided\u000d\u000a      the necessary foundation and model for translation to humans.

The\u000d\u000a      human study did not\u000d\u000a      require the use of pharmacological agents because the initial human\u000d\u000a      subject had not suffered a\u000d\u000a      complete spinal cord injury and therefore had sufficient amounts of\u000d\u000a      serotonin in the spinal cord,\u000d\u000a      unlike the completely transected rats in the original studies [1, 2,\u000d\u000a        3].\u000d\u000a    Impact on people with SCI\u000d\u000a    The significance of the human intervention for patients with severe\u000d\u000a      spinal injuries is profound. The\u000d\u000a      first patient to benefit from the intervention, a 25-year-old man who had\u000d\u000a      been paralysed below the\u000d\u000a      waist, said: \"This procedure has completely changed my life. For someone\u000d\u000a      who for four years was\u000d\u000a      unable to even move a toe, to have the freedom and ability to stand on my\u000d\u000a      own is the most\u000d\u000a      amazing feeling.\" [C]. The consequences of severe spinal injuries\u000d\u000a      reach far beyond mobility. Once\u000d\u000a      stabilised, those with SCI face a series of obstacles including management\u000d\u000a      of respiratory,\u000d\u000a      genitourinary and dermatological problems. A loss of bladder and bowel\u000d\u000a      control, as well as sexual\u000d\u000a      function, also present severe psychological and physical challenges.\u000d\u000a    After two years of unsuccessful conventional rehabilitation, the\u000d\u000a      25-year-old patient had no bowel or\u000d\u000a      bladder control and no sexual function. The treatment resulted in the\u000d\u000a      restoration of voluntary\u000d\u000a      standing and stepping under epidural stimulation [A]. This\u000d\u000a      recovery of function only occurs at the\u000d\u000a      time the epidural stimulation is being delivered, but the treatment has\u000d\u000a      transformed the patient's\u000d\u000a      everyday life because the stimulating equipment is fully portable. The\u000d\u000a      patient also recovered\u000d\u000a      urinary continence, bowel movements and is sexually potent [A,\u000d\u000a      supplementary data section of\u000d\u000a      paper]. Four people with SCI have since been implanted with similar\u000d\u000a      stimulators. According to the\u000d\u000a      leader of the study all four implanted people demonstrated similar\u000d\u000a      outcomes to the first case study\u000d\u000a      [A] recovering voluntary motor function and standing ability [B].\u000d\u000a    Increased charitable donations and commercial investment\u000d\u000a      The health and welfare impacts of Ichiyama's research have been of\u000d\u000a      enormous significance to the\u000d\u000a      patients treated, and the reach of the research's impact is already\u000d\u000a      developing beyond the\u000d\u000a      immediate clinical setting. The breakthrough based on Ichiyama's\u000d\u000a      work was widely reported in the\u000d\u000a      academic, medical and mass media and has stimulated interest in the new\u000d\u000a      field [D,E]. Charities\u000d\u000a      focussed on spinal cord injury have reported increased interest in spinal\u000d\u000a      cord injuries from the\u000d\u000a      general public and a significant rise in donations [F]. There is\u000d\u000a      significant academic activity in the\u000d\u000a      new field and the commercial medical device sector is investing in\u000d\u000a      technology to support the\u000d\u000a      intervention.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Ichiyama and colleagues has resulted in humans with\u000d\u000a      severe spinal cord injury (SCI)\u000d\u000a      recovering standing and stepping, combined with other major health\u000d\u000a      benefits including restoration\u000d\u000a      of urinary continence, bowel movements and sexual function.

Following his\u000d\u000a      appointment at the University of Leeds in 2007, Ichiyama led the\u000d\u000a      development of a detailed\u000d\u000a      rehabilitative strategy in animals (1,2,3), which combined\u000d\u000a      epidural stimulation of the spinal cord\u000d\u000a      with daily rehabilitation (locomotor training) and the administration of\u000d\u000a      quipazine (a 5-HT agonist).\u000d\u000a      This work (1,2,3) was performed in collaboration with researchers\u000d\u000a      at UCLA resulting in publications\u000d\u000a      in high impact factor peer-reviewed journals, two of which (1,2)\u000d\u000a      have been entered as individual\u000d\u000a      outputs for Ichiyama in REF2014. This research, which was based on\u000d\u000a      previous proof-of-principle\u000d\u000a      experiments, addressed critical issues including whether epidural\u000d\u000a      stimulation was safe, what the\u000d\u000a      effects of different stimulation regimes were on the animals, and the\u000d\u000a      specific combination of\u000d\u000a      stimulation, drugs and rehabilitation training that delivered optimal\u000d\u000a      results.\u000d\u000a    Ichiyama and collaborators reported (1,2,3) that the\u000d\u000a      intervention allowed animals with a severed\u000d\u000a      spine to take weight-supported steps. They found that epidural stimulation\u000d\u000a      (50Hz) of lumbar\u000d\u000a      segment L2 resulted in weight-supported coordinated plantar stepping in\u000d\u000a      rats receiving a complete\u000d\u000a      spinal transection at thoracic level T9-10; that intraperitoneal\u000d\u000a      administration of serotonin agonists\u000d\u000a      (quipazine, 8-OHDPAT) improved functional recovery (1,2,3); and\u000d\u000a      that epidural stimulation\u000d\u000a      combined with serotonin agonists significantly improved weight-bearing\u000d\u000a      stepping (1,2,3).

The social impact of the services\u000a      provided by these outdoor education companies is illustrated by the rapid\u000a      expansion of children being actively engaged in outdoor activities with\u000a      the parents.\u000a    In Hungary, the NFE project has led to the establishment of a Training\u000a      Centre by the Human Reform Foundation in Chirui Bai, currently providing\u000a      training for approximately 25 people each year.

The present project\u000d\u000a      specifically focuses upon gaining insights into the health and wellbeing\u000d\u000a      experiences of older people from diverse communities.\u000d\u000a    The key research insights are the importance of identification of the\u000d\u000a      health and well-being agenda for self-organised group activity,\u000d\u000a      particularly for culturally diverse groups of older citizens: it\u000d\u000a      highlights the recognition of the mental and physical benefits of regular\u000d\u000a      meetings for cultural activities and the significance of culturally\u000d\u000a      appropriate forms of physical activities. The underpinning research was\u000d\u000a      published in various outputs together with the `Movers &amp; Shakers'\u000d\u000a      project funded through NHS Bucks in 2009, and the subsequent development\u000d\u000a      of further culturally appropriate physical activity programmes.\u000d\u000a    Other key insights include the significance of self-directed alternative\u000d\u000a      physical activities (such as yoga) for self-resilience, embodied learning,\u000d\u000a      health and well-being. Furthermore, phenomenological research has revealed\u000d\u000a      a greater understanding of embodied active ageing, which challenges\u000d\u000a      existing and dominant discourse on ageing. The underpinning research\u000d\u000a      constituted a number of outputs based on interviews, participant\u000d\u000a      observation and (auto)-ethnographic research carried out between March\u000d\u000a      2009 and June 2012. The research programme was led by Humberstone, and\u000d\u000a      supported by Visiting Professor, Carol Cutler-Riddick, professor\u000d\u000a      gerontology and leisure, Gallaudet University from 2009 - 2011\u000d\u000a    Consideration of the ageing body and the `body techniques' practised by\u000d\u000a      older women within their yoga classes adds to theoretical and conceptual\u000d\u000a      developments in recent research on embodiment, sport and physical culture\u000d\u000a      through the focus on ageing bodies. Within the field of ageing, this\u000d\u000a      research highlights the importance of exploring alternative definitions of\u000d\u000a      the human condition, how these are shaped and assembled through particular\u000d\u000a      embodied practices which are realised personally and socially through\u000d\u000a      engagement with alternative physical activities. Unlike much sporting\u000d\u000a      practice, the body techniques managed by the participants did not\u000d\u000a      emphasise sporting prowess but provided for an integration of body and\u000d\u000a      mind. Biological ageing is accepted yet participants maintained control\u000d\u000a      over the process, challenging prevailing narratives of ageing, declining\u000d\u000a      control and increasing weakness that are taken for granted in much of\u000d\u000a      Western society. The significance of embodiment in understanding the\u000d\u000a      ageing body and particular bodily practices is highlighted, and the\u000d\u000a      importance of interpretative qualitative research to uncovering this\u000d\u000a      knowledge.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning academic research demonstrated that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      interventions aimed at older people in diverse communities and groups\u000d\u000a        can facilitate healthy active ageing through increased\u000d\u000a        self-responsibility for individual wellbeing\u000d\u000a      the perspectives and experiences of the older person is elucidated\u000d\u000a        through research on healthy active ageing\u000d\u000a      popular and prevailing discourse related to `ageing' (e.g., declining\u000d\u000a        control) can be positively challenged through developing an\u000d\u000a        understanding of older peoples' experiences of physical activity\u000d\u000a      older people experience healthy active ageing through positive\u000d\u000a        sensations &amp; expressions of emotions during embodied practices\u000d\u000a      healthy active ageing is facilitated by varied embodiment practices in\u000d\u000a        accessible, meaningful ways\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12524","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The focal point of this case study is Run to the Beat, a groundbreaking\u000d\u000a      series of mass-participation events that fuse half-marathon running with\u000d\u000a      scientifically-selected music performed by live acts and DJs along the\u000d\u000a      route. As the leader of the Music in Sport and Exercise Research Group, Dr\u000d\u000a      Karageorghis was approached by the International Management Group (IMG) to\u000d\u000a      provide scientific consultancy and to serve as a figurehead for the event;\u000d\u000a      opportunities that gave him a platform to communicate the findings of his\u000d\u000a      group's research to a wider public.\u000d\u000a    On Sunday 5 October 2008, the inaugural event featured 8,000 runners who\u000d\u000a      pounded the streets of Greenwich to the sounds of 30 live bands. A\u000d\u000a      successful renewal on Sunday 27 September 2009 demonstrated the maturity\u000d\u000a      of the concept; indeed, a 50% growth in participant numbers was realised\u000d\u000a      (12,000+). In 2010, the London event had 15,000 participants, and in 2011,\u000d\u000a      17,000. The Run to the Beat concept was rolled out across mainland Europe,\u000d\u000a      with the 2010 launch in Basel (Switzerland) being the first (2,500+) and\u000d\u000a      replicated in 2011 and 2012 with similar numbers. The event series exerts\u000d\u000a      considerable charitable and economic impact which has been alloyed by\u000d\u000a      global music sales (e.g. Run to the Beat CD and download albums in\u000d\u000a      association with Ministry of Sound and City Showcase) and the launch of\u000d\u000a      cutting-edge music players and mobile phones.\u000d\u000a    Dr Karageorghis served as a spokesperson and scientific consultant for\u000d\u000a      the launch of the Sony W-series of wearable MP3 players as well as two\u000d\u000a      Sony Ericsson mobile phones (W760i and W995 Walkman Phones). His\u000d\u000a      involvement continued until after the third renewal on 26 September 2010,\u000d\u000a      by which time the event was firmly established on the running calendar and\u000d\u000a      represented a prominent brand that was adopted by Nike Inc. for the period\u000d\u000a      2011-14. Sustained impact has occurred under the stewardship of Nike Inc.\u000d\u000a      with 18,500 participants competing at the 2012 event.\u000d\u000a    The research underpinned the impact by giving the event a strong\u000d\u000a      scientific premise which was fore-grounded in public relations\u000d\u000a      initiatives. Indeed, the science underpinning the event was eponymous in\u000d\u000a      that the title referenced the human predisposition to entrain to a musical\u000d\u000a      rhythm. The work of the research group linking exercise heart-rate with\u000d\u000a      music tempo was the main focus of the media activity associated with the\u000d\u000a      event. Coverage presented the research in a favourable light describing it\u000d\u000a      as \"novel\" and \"cutting edge\" and using the concept of Run to the Beat to\u000d\u000a      address the wider question of how music can play a motivational and\u000d\u000a      assistive role in physical activity. The way in which runners' exercise\u000d\u000a      heart-rates were used to \"contour\" the tempo of the musical selections was\u000d\u000a      a principle incorporated prominently in all marketing materials and album\u000d\u000a      releases.\u000d\u000a    Media-related activities engaged in by Dr Karageorghis included press\u000d\u000a      conferences, workshops for journalists, a pop-science section on the event\u000d\u000a      website explaining the principles underlying the music selection and\u000d\u000a      several product launches. The breadth and reach of Run to the Beat's\u000d\u000a      social impact was aided by worldwide media exposure culminating in\u000d\u000a      dedicated broadcasts on Channel 4, slots in primetime documentaries,\u000d\u000a      magazine shows throughout Europe and South America (e.g. UK, France,\u000d\u000a      Sweden, Brazil), and numerous spreads in broadsheet newspapers (e.g. The\u000d\u000a        Times and The New York Times). The primary beneficiaries\u000d\u000a      were event participants who were given a window on the research, offered\u000d\u000a      support to incorporate the findings into their event preparation, and were\u000d\u000a      able to experience it in action on the day. Carefully-selected music has\u000d\u000a      been shown to reduce perceptions of exertion by 8-12% while enhancing\u000d\u000a      affect by 10-15%. Similarly, it may improve movement efficiency by up to\u000d\u000a      7% and extend voluntary endurance by as much as 15%. For these reasons,\u000d\u000a      the music programmes provided were integral to the popularity of the\u000d\u000a      events.\u000d\u000a    Through the considerable media activity associated with Run to the Beat,\u000d\u000a      a wider pool of several million readers, listeners and viewers were\u000d\u000a      offered insights to support their own use of music in exercise. Economic\u000d\u000a      benefit from Run to the Beat was felt by the media, equipment\u000d\u000a      manufacturers (e.g. Sony and Sony Ericsson), sports promoters (IMG), the\u000d\u000a      running community who were provided with an additional and novel event in\u000d\u000a      London, and charitable institutions who gained a fulcrum for their\u000d\u000a      fundraising endeavours. London-based artists also benefitted from the\u000d\u000a      event as they were given a platform (online and on stage) to perform their\u000d\u000a      work and develop their public profiles. For example, the relatively\u000d\u000a      unknown south London rapper, Tinie Tempah, was booked for the 2010 event\u000d\u000a      and his single Written In The Stars went to #1 in the Vodafone Big\u000d\u000a      Top 40 chart on the evening of the event following his performance on the\u000d\u000a      main stage (26 September 2010;\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.bigtop40.com\/chart\/archive\/2010\/39\/).\u000d\u000a    A distinctive characteristic of the social impact and capital generated\u000d\u000a      by Run to the Beat has been the uniting of those in the sporting,\u000d\u000a      mercantile, entertainment and creative industries. Alliances have\u000d\u000a      developed between the various beneficiaries: national charities, musical\u000d\u000a      collectives such as the Panjabi Hit Squad and the Royal Artillery Band,\u000d\u000a      blue chip companies such as Sony Ericsson, and local government. As the\u000d\u000a      group's research is synonymous with the event, every form of publicity and\u000d\u000a      outreach directly amplifies the impact of this work. Impact was also\u000d\u000a      created along civic lines through the provision of social events that\u000d\u000a      generated community interest and an influx of visitors into the local\u000d\u000a      authority area (Greenwich). The Run to the Beat brand cemented the\u000d\u000a      association of Brunel with the use of music in exercise and furthered the\u000d\u000a      profile of Karageorghis as its foremost practitioner. Subsequent to his\u000d\u000a      involvement, Dr Karageorghis has been asked to fulfil numerous knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer projects and consultancy work that has generated considerable\u000d\u000a      impact. These projects include appearing as a witness to support claims of\u000d\u000a      musical rights agencies to obtain proper rights for their content when\u000d\u000a      reproduced in gymnasia, the compilation of a BASES Expert Statement, which\u000d\u000a      is the most viewed of all 11 statements (4,695 unique page views; source\u000d\u000a      BASES), the invitation to produce an encyclopaedia entry on the topic for\u000d\u000a      Sage, and more recently, his appointment by the American College of Sports\u000d\u000a      Medicine as Chair of MusicMoves: A Global Health Initiative. Run\u000d\u000a      to the Beat has spawned further innovative projects that found their focus\u000d\u000a      in the 2012 London Olympiad. In an initiative sponsored by Red Bull,\u000d\u000a      Karageorghis teamed up with Urban music producer Redlight and Team GB\u000d\u000a      Athletics captain, Dai Green, to devise a new piece of music to help the\u000d\u000a      athlete prepare for his 400-metre hurdles bid; this work proved to be very\u000d\u000a      much the `heir apparent' to the case study described herein\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.redbull.co.uk\/cs\/Satellite\/en_UK\/Video\/Red-Bull-Performance-Track-021243219217531).\u000d\u000a    In summary, Run to the Beat generated wide- and far-reaching impact which\u000d\u000a      was felt across an array of sectors (industry, charity, art, media and\u000d\u000a      civic) and by event participants in the UK and Europe, media users across\u000d\u000a      the globe (e.g. via prominent coverage in the USA and Brazil), and the\u000d\u000a      local communities that hosted the races. Run to the Beat has brought the\u000d\u000a      subject of exercise to music into the public consciousness in a way that\u000d\u000a      has not occurred since the surge in popularity associated with aerobic\u000d\u000a      dance exercise in the early 1980s. The output of the Music in Sport and\u000d\u000a      Exercise Research Group has percolated society at an increasing rate,\u000d\u000a      informing both the knowledge base and practice of sport and exercise over\u000d\u000a      the last decade. As an index of the reach of the impact, the Brunel-based\u000d\u000a      music research is cited &gt;100,000 times on Google.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Drawing on his research in the area of music and physical activity, Dr\u000d\u000a      Costas Karageorghis was invited to serve as a scientific advisor for a\u000d\u000a      groundbreaking series of musically-accompanied running events held\u000d\u000a      annually in London. Run to the Beat&#8482; is a unique concept in that the\u000d\u000a      half-marathon course was lined with music stations delivering output based\u000d\u000a      on the scientific research led by Dr Karageorghis at Brunel over the last\u000d\u000a      two decades. Ultimately, Run to the Beat garnered considerable economic\u000d\u000a      benefits in the health, entertainment, charitable, and technology sectors,\u000d\u000a      and represented a knowledge transfer that reached tens of millions across\u000d\u000a      the world through internet, television, radio, and print-media channels.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    BRUNEL UNIVERSITY (H0113)\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Brunel University","InstitutionName":"Brunel University","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10000961}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661604","Name":"Basel"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Each of the following outputs is available to the Panel through online\u000d\u000a      databases (SPORTDiscus, MEDLINE, PsycInfo) and the HEI.

These studies were carried out in\u000d\u000a      the academic sessions (October-May) of 2004\/5, 2006\/7, and 2008\/9 and\u000d\u000a      published in 2006, 2008, and 2011 respectively. The first study\u000d\u000a      established the essential purpose of the series; to assess preference for\u000d\u000a      varying music tempi across a range of exercise intensities. Participants\u000d\u000a      reported a preference for both medium and fast tempo music at low and\u000d\u000a      moderate exercise intensities, and for fast tempo music at high intensity.\u000d\u000a      The second study in the series was focussed on the effects of differing\u000d\u000a      music tempi on psychological responses (i.e. intrinsic motivation and flow\u000d\u000a      state) in addition to music-tempo preference. Participants undertook\u000d\u000a      endurance exercise on a treadmill whilst listening to either medium\u000d\u000a      (115-120 bpm), fast (140-145 bpm), or mixed (alternating medium and fast)\u000d\u000a      tempi music programmes. The outcomes were that a medium-tempi music\u000d\u000a      programme yielded the best motivational outcomes and was the most likely\u000d\u000a      to be preferred. The third study was the most ambitious and sought to\u000d\u000a      comprehensively map the relationship between tempo-preference and exercise\u000d\u000a      heart-rate by employing a broad range of tempi (slow, medium, fast, and\u000d\u000a      very fast) and exercise intensities (40%-90% of maximal heart rate\u000d\u000a      reserve). The findings confirmed that faster music is preferred at higher\u000d\u000a      exercise intensities but the relationship is more complex than the\u000d\u000a      simplistic linear one proposed by theorist Makoto Iwanaga in the\u000d\u000a      mid-nineties. In essence, the relationship is non-linear exhibiting a\u000d\u000a      series of dips and plateaux (see Section 3: Karageorghis et al., 2011). A\u000d\u000a      key finding that informed subsequent work with exercise populations was\u000d\u000a      that exercisers prefer a much narrower band of tempi (125-140 bpm) than\u000d\u000a      previously thought (90-160 bpm). The findings from this series of studies\u000d\u000a      informed the music selection for the Run to the Beat events.\u000d\u000a    The positions held by the authors at Brunel were as follows: Dr\u000d\u000a      Karageorghis led each study as a Senior Lecturer in 2004\/5 and as a Reader\u000d\u000a      thereafter. Leighton Jones, who was second author on each of the papers,\u000d\u000a      was an undergraduate student from 2001-04, a master's student from\u000d\u000a      2004-06, and a doctoral student (on a Sport Sciences bursary) from\u000d\u000a      2010-13. Daniel Low, a co-author for the first paper, was an undergraduate\u000d\u000a      student at the time the data were collected and subsequently completed a\u000d\u000a      doctorate at Exeter University (2010). Daniel Stuart, co-author for the\u000d\u000a      second paper, was an undergraduate student during the period 2003-06. The\u000d\u000a      final paper was co-authored by Dr David-Lee Priest who read for a\u000d\u000a      doctorate in Sport Sciences from 1998-2003 (funded by David Lloyd Leisure\u000d\u000a      Ltd.) and has since undertaken part-time duties as a Research Assistant\u000d\u000a      and Lecturer, Daniel Bishop who has served as a Lecturer since 2007, and\u000d\u000a      Harry Lim, who was a doctoral student in the group from 2008-12 (on a\u000d\u000a      Sport Sciences bursary).

This is significant for two main reasons. First,\u000a      it has begun to embed international human rights and child welfare in the\u000a      international sport delivery system (through the IFs and NOCs); and\u000a      secondly, it has begun to transform the way that UNICEF and its partners\u000a      engage with children's sport. The impact of Brackenridge's research on\u000a      these practice communities is reflected in:\u000a    \u000a      the commitment of UNICEF's Chief of Child protection, Susan Bissell,\u000a        to adapt the General Measures that are used to evaluate the\u000a        implementation of the Articles in the UN Convention on the Rights of the\u000a        Child to incorporate prevention of abuse in sport (from 2010 onwards);\u000a      the IOC request for every National Olympic Committee to develop an\u000a        athlete protection and anti-harassment infrastructure (from 2007\u000a        onwards);\u000a      the home country Sports Councils' development of mandatory athlete\u000a        welfare and safeguarding standards by all government-funded sport\u000a        organisations (from 2003 onwards);\u000a      requests for advice about athlete welfare, policy development and\u000a        abuse prevention from international federations and UK government sport\u000a        agencies (ongoing);\u000a      the requirement for every BASES-accredited\/chartered sport scientists\u000a        to undertake training in child protection (from 2004 onwards);\u000a      the mainstreaming of FA's Respect (behaviour improvement) programme\u000a        throughout the affiliated game (from 2008-09).

She convened this group and led the\u000a      writing of the Consensus Statement based on its research (published\u000a      February 2007). Its recommendations constitute an action plan for all\u000a      International Federations (IFs) and National Olympic Committees (NOCs) on\u000a      policy development and education and training for coaches, administrators\u000a      and athletes. In 2009-10 the IOC invited Brackenridge to lead a research\u000a      review and design of online education materials on abuse prevention for\u000a      athletes and coaches (piloted at the first Youth Olympic Games, in\u000a      Singapore, Aug 2010), and materials for IFs and NOCs to help them prevent\u000a      harassment and abuse (launched at the Youth Winter Olympic Games in\u000a      Innsbruck, Jan 2012).\u000a    In 2007, Brackenridge was invited by UNICEF to be lead researcher for two\u000a      Expert Panel meetings on sport and violence against children at their\u000a      Innocenti Research Centre in Florence, Italy. Outputs from the associated\u000a      commissioned research were published in 2010. The main publication\u000a      emanating from this work (www.unicef-irc.org\/publications\/pdf\/violence_in_sport.pdf)\u000a      set out the evidence base for violence against children in sport and\u000a      practical steps by which children's rights and welfare might be embedded\u000a      within sport at all levels; from community recreation to elite\u000a      performance. This is of particular importance for the burgeoning\u000a      sport-for-development movement to ensure child protection within\u000a      and not just through sport. This work led directly to the launch\u000a      of International Standards for Safeguarding Children in Sport (www.sportsfeatures.com\/presspoint\/pressrelease\/53002).\u000a    Brackenridge has continued to publish empirically-driven, basic and\u000a      applied research and to conduct welfare-related studies for a range of\u000a      sport organisations within the UK including: the English FA (a book and\u000a      two Respect programme evaluation reports) and sportscotland\u000a      (reviews of women in sport and of sexual orientation in sport). She has\u000a      also developed methodological innovations for data management and for\u000a      measuring organisational change. In 2010, with funding from the NSPCC, she\u000a      organised an international research and policy symposium on the elite\u000a      child athlete which was used as a platform to launch a young scientists'\u000a      network &#8212; the Brunel International Research Network for Athlete Welfare\u000a      (BIRNAW). More than 50 researchers worldwide had joined before the second\u000a      BIRNAW Symposium in November 2013. Its purpose is to extend the community\u000a      of scholars and to broaden athlete welfare research beyond sexual\u000a      exploitation to encompass themes such as: emotional abuse, relationship\u000a      breakdown and maintenance, disordered eating, self-harming, overtraining\u000a      and other paediatric exercise concerns.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15173","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    POWERbreathe&#174; is an exercise product, patented by McConnell, which trains\u000a      the breathing muscles. Prior to its commercial launch in 1997, no consumer\u000a      breathing training products existed. Wide-ranging benefits include,\u000a      ubiquitous improvements in exercise tolerance and breathlessness. The\u000a      ground breaking status of POWERbreathe&#174; has necessitated education of the\u000a      market, relying heavily upon the group's body of research. This scientific\u000a      heritage also allows marketing claims to comply with UK and international\u000a      advertising standards. POWERbreathe&#174; is the global market-leading brand of\u000a      breathing training products, and sales have grown steeply since it was\u000a      acquired by POWERbreathe International Ltd (PBI) in 2000 (data available\u000a      directly from PBI); UK channels include household names such as Amazon,\u000a      Boots and John Lewis. POWERbreathe&#174; has received extensive media coverage\u000a      and positive product reviews. The global reach of POWERbreathe&#174; is\u000a      demonstrated by sales through PBI's overseas subsidiaries and distributors\u000a      in 43 countries. It's also noteworthy that POWERbreathe&#174;'s success has\u000a      spawned a number of copycat products, brought to market by new companies,\u000a      which also cite the group's research in their marketing. Whilst the\u000a      group's research has become part of a larger body of knowledge, it has\u000a      contributed key papers, providing the mainstay of marketing support for\u000a      the breathing training product category. In May 2011, McConnell published\u000a      a monograph on the IMT for sportspeople. The medical market is also\u000a      supported by the group's outputs, especially its elucidation of underlying\u000a      mechanisms. The significance of this body of literature to clinical\u000a      practice is illustrated by a watershed event in 2006, when the\u000a      POWERbreathe&#174; Medic became the first exercise training equipment\u000a      approved by the Prescription Pricing Authority for NHS prescription.\u000a      Clinical collaborations have also resulted in outputs supporting novel\u000a      clinical applications such as postural control (REF2) and low back pain\u000a      (REF2), as well as more traditional applications such as asthma (REF2). In\u000a      May 2013, McConnell published a monograph supporting the implementation of\u000a      IMT in healthcare settings.\u000a    Insights provided by the group's research (section 3, #6) were exploited\u000a      through two KTPs to extend the POWERbreathe&#174; product range, and in 2010\u000a      the world's first electronic inspiratory muscle trainer was launched. The\u000a      development resulted in a new patent (McConnell is an inventor) and a\u000a      royalty bearing licence agreement. The product won the Plastic's Industry\u000a      2010 \"Consumer Product Design of the Year\" award, and was featured on the\u000a      European Respiratory Society annual meeting Buyers' guide 2011. In July\u000a      2013, McConnell also began providing consultancy services to a global,\u000a      market-leading respiratory medical company. The company wishes to develop\u000a      a novel product, specifically for patients undergoing mechanical\u000a      ventilation.\u000a    Reach\u000a    The reach of the impact created by the group's research has been\u000a      maximised via: 1. peer-reviewed journal papers; 2. conference\u000a      presentations; 3. articles in consumer publications; 4. presentations to\u000a      opinion formers and the general public; 5. a book on \"breathing training\"\u000a      for sports people (&gt;6k sales in 24 mo); 6. a book on respiratory muscle\u000a      training for clinicians; 7. a sports website [breathestrong.com] and a\u000a      clinical website [physiobreathe.com]; 8. social media [Twitter, Facebook,\u000a      Blog]; 9. iPhone Apps (&gt;1k sales in 18 mo).

Research took a sequential path: 1. describing\u000a      physiological responses to inspiratory muscle training (IMT); 2.\u000a      elucidating underlying mechanisms; 3. using insights gained in 2 to inform\u000a      new product development. The research has underpinned the marketing and\u000a      development of \"breathing training\" products by POWERbreathe&#174; and by new\u000a      entrants to the breathing training market. Fundamental to commercial\u000a      success has been the group's leading contribution to: 1. evidence that IMT\u000a      is ergogenic and 2. elucidation of underlying mechanisms. Two independent\u000a      meta-analyses confirming the efficacy of IMT in healthy adults rely\u000a      heavily upon the group's work. In the Illi et al. study (Sports Med\u000a      42, 707-724, 2012), the group contributed half of the data that\u000a      were meta-analysed. The following summarises the important research\u000a      insights underpinning impact.\u000a    The rationale for IMT is underpinned by evidence of respiratory muscle\u000a      overload during exercise, which manifests as respiratory muscle fatigue,\u000a      and\/or as respiratory muscle metaboreflex activation. Group members\u000a      (McConnell, Romer, Volianitis, Griffiths, Lomax, Ross, Taylor)\u000a      have each published evidence of post-exercise respiratory muscle fatigue\u000a      in healthy adults (e.g., #1, 2, 5). Linked to this rationale is evidence\u000a      that prior fatigue of respiratory muscles hastens exercise intolerance and\u000a      limb fatigue (McConnell, Romer, Lomax, Taylor; e.g., #6). This\u000a      evidence supports the marketing proposition that IMT solves a real-world\u000a      problem.\u000a    The group has also provided evidence that IMT is ergogenic and reduces\u000a      inspiratory muscle fatigue (McConnell, Romer, Volianitis, Griffiths;\u000a      e.g.,#1, 2, 5), but that expiratory muscle training is not ergogenic\u000a      (McConnell, Griffiths; e.g., #2). Descriptive insights are\u000a      underpinned by the elucidation, and the exclusion, of underlying\u000a      mechanisms; the group was the first to implicate the inspiratory muscle\u000a      metaboreflex in ergogenicity (Romer, McConnell; #1), and the first to\u000a      provide evidence supporting this mechanism (McConnell, Lomax; #4).\u000a      Mechanistic clarity has also been provided by excluding involvement of\u000a      maximal oxygen uptake and lactate threshold (McConnell, Romer). Evidence\u000a      of efficacy is exploited to support marketing claims, whilst mechanistic\u000a      insight enhances credibility. The group was also the first to show that\u000a      acute, non-fatiguing inspiratory muscle loading (\"warm-up\") improves\u000a      inspiratory muscle function (McConnell, Volianitis, Lomax, Ross;\u000a      e.g., #3) via central and peripheral processes (McConnell, Ross;\u000a      #3). Functionally, inspiratory \"warm-up\" enhances exercise performance and\u000a      reduces breathing effort (McConnell, Volianitis), providing a further\u000a      marketing proposition.\u000a    Most recently, McConnell has explored IMT in patients, demonstrating\u000a      that: 1. IMT improves exercise tolerance and reduces dyspnoea, as well as\u000a      reducing the oxygen cost of exercise in asthmatics (#5 and REF2); and 2.\u000a      acute inspiratory loading attenuates bronchoconstriction after deep\u000a      inhalation in asthmatics (see REF2). Novel applications of IMT to enhance\u000a      postural balance are also supported (see REF2). Romer contributed to\u000a      evidence that oxygen uptake kinetics are hastened by IMT. The group has\u000a      also characterised (mechanically and physiologically) the training\u000a      stimulus delivered during IMT, using these insights to inform development\u000a      of new, improved products (see section 4) (#6 and REF2).\u000a    Author status:\u000a    Brunel employees: McConnell (Reader &amp; Professor; 2000&gt;),\u000a      Romer (Senior Lecturer and Reader; 2004&gt;), Volianitis (Lecturer;\u000a      2004-07), Ross (Lecturer; 2005-08), Taylor (Research Associate; 2007-09)\u000a    PhD students (Awarded): Griffiths (2010), How\u000a      (2010), Lomax (2007), Ross (2005), Taylor (2007)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15515","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research in the department's Extreme Environments Laboratory (EEL) by the\u000d\u000a      EEMSRG has had profound, global and paradigm-altering significance within\u000d\u000a      the REF period.\u000d\u000a    a. Impact on the protection, rescue and treatment of immersion\u000d\u000a        casualties. The EEMSRG introduced the concepts of \"Cold Shock\";\u000d\u000a      \"Circum-rescue collapse\" and \"Autonomic conflict\"; these major advances in\u000d\u000a      the understanding of the physiological response to immersion have directly\u000d\u000a      informed the protection (equipment provided), rescue (methods) and\u000d\u000a      treatment (priorities) of immersion casualties: \"Dr Tipton's\u000d\u000a        elucidation of cold water shock has transformed the physiologic\u000d\u000a        understanding of drowning.\" (1). \"The work of the laboratory has\u000d\u000a        significantly influenced our thinking and understanding of the hazardous\u000d\u000a        responses to immersion and ... our policies for the search, rescue and\u000d\u000a        treatment of immersion casualties\" (2). EEMSRGs work is regularly\u000d\u000a      used in fatal accident enquiries and legal cases, ranging from child abuse\u000d\u000a      to murder, informing decisions and recommendations (3, 4).\u000d\u000a    b. Impact on International standards, guidelines, training manuals.\u000d\u000a      The premier organisation for establishing international standards in sea\u000d\u000a      survival is the UN's International Maritime Organisation (173 member\u000d\u000a      nations). Its \"A Pocket Guide to Cold Water Survival\", was \"largely\u000d\u000a        based on the work of the EEL (EEMSRG)\" (5). Published in 2012, it\u000d\u000a      sold in excess of 10,000 copies in the first three months. This\u000d\u000a      publication forms the basis of the immersion survival, protection and\u000d\u000a      search and rescue policies of member states.\u000d\u000a    EEMSRG research has informed the training programmes of numerous\u000d\u000a      international organisations including the International Lifesaving\u000d\u000a      Federation, the world authority for drowning prevention, lifesaving and\u000d\u000a      lifesaving sport. Our work has \"influenced the development of\u000d\u000a        international lifesaving programmes and standards\" and \"a number\u000d\u000a        of the ILS International Lifesaving Certificates have standards based on\u000d\u000a        evidence arising from the University of Portsmouth\" (6). The work of\u000d\u000a      the EEMSRG appears in many first aid and search and rescue training\u000d\u000a      manuals, including those of: the Royal National Lifeboat Institution\u000d\u000a      (RNLI), Royal Yachting Association (RYA), Mountain Rescue; Surf Lifesaving\u000d\u000a      GB and New Zealand; Moroccan SAR; Royal Netherlands SAR; US Lifesaving\u000d\u000a      Association; UK and Canadian military SAR; Yachting Australia. \"The\u000d\u000a        research work (of the EEMSRG) has produced the science to base our\u000d\u000a        current casualty care syllabus, teaching and practice upon in the fields\u000d\u000a        of immersion, submersion and hypothermia\" (7, 8).\u000d\u000a    Recent research on \"Autonomic Conflict\" (2012, Section 3, Reference 5) is\u000d\u000a      already described in the first aid manuals and training material of Surf\u000d\u000a      Lifesaving GB and the RNLI.

In the UK it has been the catalyst to move the different\u000d\u000a      SAR agencies towards using a common operational protocol: \"Portsmouth\u000d\u000a        University influenced our thinking, assisted and supported the\u000d\u000a        development of National Guidance\" (8, 9). Our work appears verbatim\u000d\u000a      in the Fire &amp; Rescue Services National Operational Guidance on Water\u000d\u000a      Rescue and Flooding. Recent research on survival time during head-out\u000d\u000a      immersion has been used by the US Coastguard to produce new search and\u000d\u000a      rescue models and strategy.\u000d\u000a    c. Impact on public awareness. An important method for reducing\u000d\u000a      the number of annual immersion deaths involves educating the public about\u000d\u000a      the risks of cold immersion. This form of \"preventative medicine\" has been\u000d\u000a      achieved through involvement with various agencies noted above; helping\u000d\u000a      them produce campaigns for lifejacket usage e.g. \"Useless unless worn\"\u000d\u000a      (UK: RNLI, HMCoastguard); \"\"Stay on top with a lifejacket\" (Maritime New\u000d\u000a      Zealand); \"Wear one for openers\" (Maritime Australia). We have also been\u000d\u000a      involved in water safety campaigns (e.g. RNLI \"Respect Water\" campaign\u000d\u000a      August 2013) and appeared in, and helped write the script for the RNLI\u000d\u000a      water safety video \"Cold Shock\" (2010), as well as taught on RNLI, RoSPA\u000d\u000a      and RYA sea survival courses. Between 2008 and 2012 EEMSRG staff were\u000d\u000a      involved in over 100 media appearances demonstrating and discussing the\u000d\u000a      risks of immersion. Tipton also lectures on immersion and drowning to\u000d\u000a      medical students in London, Leeds and Birmingham.\u000d\u000a    It would be nice to think that the impact outlined above has saved lives.\u000d\u000a      This is difficult to determine definitively, however it is encouraging to\u000d\u000a      hear from those that should know that this is the case: \"There is little\u000d\u000a      doubt that the work the (EEMSRG) does in the field of cold water survival\u000d\u000a      continues to save lives every year (10); \"Without doubt the excellent work\u000d\u000a      carried out by (EEMSRG) has contributed significantly to our goal of\u000d\u000a      saving lives at sea\" (7); \"The work of the EEMSRG has undoubtedly saved\u000d\u000a      the lives of immersion casualties\" (8). \"This has been literally\u000d\u000a      lifesaving work.

Again, and importantly, the\u000d\u000a      applied implications of these findings for the search, rescue and\u000d\u000a      resuscitation of submerged casualties were developed by meta-analysis and\u000d\u000a      consensus meetings into a decision making guide to assist the search and\u000d\u000a      rescue community (4). With the aim of making search and rescue policies as\u000d\u000a      realistic as possible, the ability to undertake basic life support on\u000d\u000a      small boats has also been studied (3). In addition to looking at\u000d\u000a      technology-based protection against cold (EBA, specialist clothing), the\u000d\u000a      EEMSRG have undertaken a detailed examination of habituation to cold, as\u000d\u000a      well as studied the novel concept of \"cross-adaptation\" between cold\u000d\u000a      immersion and altitude (Lunt et al, 2012).\u000d\u000a    Recent work has included a new theory for sudden cardiac death on\u000d\u000a      immersion and in other circumstances. \"Autonomic Conflict\" occurs when the\u000d\u000a      two branches of the autonomic nervous system are co-activated (Tipton et\u000d\u000a      al, 2010). The proposed mechanism underlying Autonomic Conflict has been\u000d\u000a      investigated by a combination of human and isolated heart studies (5).\u000d\u000a      Consistent with the EEMSRG's approach of ensuring that the relevance and\u000d\u000a      application of fundamental work is communicated to those who may be most\u000d\u000a      impacted, additional applied research work and papers have been produced\u000d\u000a      in the areas of helicopter underwater escape training (Tipton et al, 2010)\u000d\u000a      and open water sporting events (6). This work is already having an impact\u000d\u000a      on the interpretation of immersion-related deaths and the planning of\u000d\u000a      sporting events. Much of the applied output of the EEMSRG is through\u000d\u000a      scientific reports directly to specific agencies; it is by this route that\u000d\u000a      the most direct impact occurs; we have published 58 such reports since\u000d\u000a      2008.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15982","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 1997 SIRC has carried out the majority of UK Sport's research into\u000d\u000a      major events and has added value to the process via meta-evaluations, peer\u000d\u000a      reviewed journal articles, conference presentations, chapters in books,\u000d\u000a      and extensive media coverage. The main impacts of this underpinning\u000d\u000a      research derive from the setting up of the eventimpacts website in 2010.\u000d\u000a      The overall impact of the research is that since 2010 it is common\u000d\u000a      practice for evaluation contracts to specify that the outputs must be\u000d\u000a      eventimpacts.com compliant. Furthermore, the eventimpacts.com website now\u000d\u000a      acts as a growing public repository for research that uses the methods\u000d\u000a      advocated (http:\/\/www.eventimpacts.com\/project\/new-research\/).\u000d\u000a    `Contractors carrying out research on our behalf are asked to use the\u000d\u000a        EventIMPACTS methodology which in turn gives us consistency of approach\u000d\u000a        and comparability of data across events. We refer all event organisers\u000d\u000a        to the EventIMPACTS website, regardless of whether we fund them or not\u000d\u000a        and have also promoted the work internationally where it has been really\u000d\u000a        well received.' Senior officer, EventScotland (source iii below)\u000d\u000a    Techniques used in, and findings from, SIRC's research have been\u000d\u000a      instrumental in facilitating the setting of property rights for major\u000d\u000a      events such that public sector bodies can conduct estimated Cost Benefit\u000d\u000a      Analysis exercises in advance of their investment to establish the extent\u000d\u000a      to which their investment represents value for money. These estimates can\u000d\u000a      now be confirmed or refuted post event using actual data and the\u000d\u000a      evaluation framework detailed in eventimpacts.com. The impact of this\u000d\u000a      economic impact forecasting model has enabled public sector bodies to\u000d\u000a      secure better value for money for their investments. For example Sheffield\u000d\u000a      City Council used the outputs of SIRC's economic impact analyses to\u000d\u000a      determine the level of its investment in retaining the World Snooker\u000d\u000a      Championship in Sheffield until 2017:\u000d\u000a    `The SIRC research at the World Snooker Championship revealed just how\u000d\u000a        valuable the event was to the city with an annual injection of around\u000d\u000a        &#163;2.5m in visitor spending and place marketing value of over &#163;3m accruing\u000d\u000a        from 100+ hours of coverage on the BBC. Faced with global competition to\u000d\u000a        prise the event away from Sheffield, we were able to use the SIRC\u000d\u000a        research to put together a package of funding and other benefits that\u000d\u000a        persuaded the promoters of the event to keep it in Sheffield.'\u000d\u000a      Senior officer, Sheffield City Council (source iv below)\u000d\u000a    Part of the impact of SIRC's research is that the eventimpacts.com\u000d\u000a      framework has been used in research by SIRC to benefit the knowledge and\u000d\u000a      planning of major events by the following: national governing bodies of\u000d\u000a      sport (e.g. British Cycling 2010, 2 events in 2011, 2 events in 2012;\u000d\u000a      British Rowing 2005, 2008, 2011); local authorities (e.g. Sheffield City\u000d\u000a      Council, World Snooker Championship 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011; Isle of Wight\u000d\u000a      Council, Isle of Wight Music Festival, 2008); national tourism agencies\u000d\u000a      (e.g. Failte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, 2010, 2011,\u000d\u000a      2012); and commercial events (Tour de France 2007 and planning for 2014;\u000d\u000a      London Marathon 2001 and 2010; and The Open Golf Championship 2010, 2011,\u000d\u000a      2012 and 2013. Invariably the rationale for this research has been to\u000d\u000a      evaluate the effectiveness of the use of public funding. The SIRC research\u000d\u000a      enables stakeholders to employ a theoretically sound approach that\u000d\u000a      provides a credible `at least' estimate that can be supported with an\u000d\u000a      audit trail of evidence.\u000d\u000a    `The economic impact measurement technique designed by the Sport Industry\u000d\u000a      Research Centre and outlined in Measuring Success: The economics &#8212; a guide\u000d\u000a      was first used in Northern Ireland at the World Boxing Championships in\u000d\u000a      2001. This was one of the first major sports events to be held in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland after the Good Friday Agreement and there was strong interest in\u000d\u000a      both the economic and media profile impacts that the event would have on\u000d\u000a      Belfast. The SIRC report proved to be very influential in setting a\u000d\u000a      benchmark for the type of information we needed to find out about the\u000d\u000a      impact of events. Following the boxing event, the Northern Ireland Events\u000d\u000a      Company was established and for the first three years of its existence it\u000d\u000a      commissioned SIRC to evaluate the impact of events into which public money\u000d\u000a      was invested. This was important research as prior to the Good Friday\u000d\u000a      Agreement there has been no tradition of attracting major sports events to\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland.' Senior officer, Sport Northern Ireland (source ii\u000d\u000a    below)\u000d\u000a    Research has also been made accessible to event organisers who normally\u000d\u000a      would be unable to access the expertise and resources to conduct event\u000d\u000a      evaluations. The eventimpacts.com website provides users with the choice\u000d\u000a      to select basic, intermediate or advanced level analysis, depending on\u000d\u000a      their needs. In addition the site has a built in economic impact\u000d\u000a      calculator which estimates the likely economic impact of an event subject\u000d\u000a      to users populating the calculator with key parameters about the scale of\u000d\u000a      any event. This forecasting tool provides event organisers with robust\u000d\u000a      data about the wider value of their events, whilst simultaneously\u000d\u000a      providing funders with a test of reasonableness as to what an appropriate\u000d\u000a      scale of investment might be (sources ii, iii, iv). National Governing\u000d\u000a      Bodies of Sport applying for funding from UK Sport's World Class Events'\u000d\u000a      Programme are encouraged to use this resource to support their cases.\u000d\u000a    `I think it would be fair to say that we are seeing increasing numbers\u000d\u000a        of potential event bidders or funding applicants using the economic\u000d\u000a        impact calculator to inform the economic forecasting aspects of their\u000d\u000a        submissions. In addition, it has been very encouraging to see organisers\u000d\u000a        of some of our bigger events &#8212; e.g. Ryder Cup and Rugby League World Cup &#8212; leaning\u000d\u000a\u0009\u0009heavily on eventIMPACTS in developing multi-stranded\u000d\u000a        evaluation studies of those events.' Senior manager, UK Sport\u000d\u000a      (source i below)\u000d\u000a    Whilst most event impact research has been in sport, the principles are\u000d\u000a      transferable to other cultural events. Indeed eventimpacts.com included\u000d\u000a      SIRC's research on the Edinburgh International Film Festival and the Pipe\u000d\u000a      Band World Championships 2009 held in Glasgow. In 2010 SIRC was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by Arts Council England to validate an economic and social\u000d\u000a      return on investment model for the cultural sector. This model is also\u000d\u000a      available online (http:\/\/www.eitoolkit.org.uk\/).\u000a      The impact of this tool is that basic economic impact calculations have\u000d\u000a      been democratised so that even small scale event organisers can have\u000d\u000a      access to evaluation techniques of this type.\u000d\u000a    Since 2010 and underpinned by SIRC research, eventimpacts.com has been a\u000d\u000a      contributory factor in the following:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      an increase in the number of events hosted in the UK; for example in\u000d\u000a        the period 2000 to 2007 UK Sport helped to support 9 major events per\u000d\u000a        year whereas in the period 2008 to 2013 this figure nearly doubled to an\u000d\u000a        average of 17 events per year. : `The SIRC research and the Measuring\u000d\u000a          Success series have been instrumental in pursuing a policy of\u000d\u000a          attracting more major events to Northern Ireland as well as helping to\u000d\u000a          support the case for enhanced funding.'

Our research has included data collation and analyses tasks at\u000d\u000a      prestigious commercial events such as the London Marathon (twice: 2000 and\u000d\u000a      2010), the Tour de France (Le Grand Depart from London in 2007), Wimbledon\u000d\u000a      (2006), and all the Open Golf Championships from 2010 to 2013.\u000d\u000a    UK Sport, with VisitBritain, EventScotland, London Development Agency,\u000d\u000a      North West Development Agency, Yorkshire Forward, and Glasgow City\u000d\u000a      Marketing Bureau, commissioned the www.eventimpacts.com\u000d\u000a      website (grant d), launched in March 2010, which provided guidance on good\u000d\u000a      practice. The guidance within eventimpacts.com has been devised following\u000d\u000a      independent evaluations of six events taking place across Great Britain in\u000d\u000a      the summer of 2008. SIRC was the lead research partner for this work,\u000d\u000a      managing a consortium consisting of the University of Cardiff, the\u000d\u000a      University of Stirling and Substance (a social enterprise consultancy).\u000d\u000a    Our three Measuring Success research reports revealed that major\u000d\u000a      events and festivals have an economic impact which can be quantified using\u000d\u000a      recognised, but suitably adapted, principles from mainstream economics\u000d\u000a      (e.g. reference 3). Repeated testing of the model has revealed a typology\u000d\u000a      of events which in turn influences the nature of the economic impacts they\u000d\u000a      create (reference 4). The typology also reveals that different types of\u000d\u000a      economic impact assessment are needed for different scales of events. For\u000d\u000a      mega events such as the Olympic Games, Input Output Analysis (IOA) using a\u000d\u000a      satellite account for sport is probably the most appropriate method,\u000d\u000a      whereas for one-off events in existing facilities the Direct Expenditure\u000d\u000a      Approach (DEA) is a pragmatic alternative. This work provided the industry\u000d\u000a      with an understanding of the nature of economic impacts attributable to\u000d\u000a      sports events and of the tools needed to measure them.\u000d\u000a    In addition to economic impact, events also have the potential to deliver\u000d\u000a      other outcomes that can be demonstrated using other social science\u000d\u000a      research techniques. Research by Shibli and Gratton (1999, reference 2)\u000d\u000a      quantified media coverage achieved by a major sport event, which in turn\u000d\u000a      enabled concepts such as place marketing effects and sponsors' return on\u000d\u000a      investment to be computed objectively using recognised economic and\u000d\u000a      management accounting techniques. The volume of data collected since 1996\u000d\u000a      allied to our typology of events has also led to the development of a\u000d\u000a      forecasting tool to estimate the likely economic impact of future events.\u000d\u000a      By comparing pre-event forecasts with actual estimates based on primary\u000d\u000a      research during and after an event, the model has been refined to be\u000d\u000a      accurate (typically) within a range of 80% to 120% of findings emerging\u000d\u000a      from primary research.\u000d\u000a    Public bodies investing in sports events also aim to achieve social\u000d\u000a      impacts ranging from short term improvements to people's quality of life\u000d\u000a      (e.g. enjoyment), through to long term legacy outcomes such as sustained\u000d\u000a      engagement in sport and physical activity resulting in improved long term\u000d\u000a      health. To support the measurement of these social outcomes, SIRC's\u000d\u000a      research has enabled eventimpacts.com to provide logic chains, complete\u000d\u000a      with counterfactual arguments, that enable stakeholders clearly to\u000d\u000a      articulate the process by which intention (e.g. increased participation in\u000d\u000a      sport) might convert into measurable outcomes directly attributable to a\u000d\u000a      preceding intervention. With London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games\u000d\u000a      secured in part on promises of legacy outcomes and the desire to `inspire\u000d\u000a      a generation', the social impacts module of eventimpacts.com has been\u000d\u000a      developed to include the inspirational impacts of sports events (grant e\u000d\u000a      and reference 5) bringing about positive behaviour change in terms of\u000d\u000a      greater participation in sport and recreation.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers\u000d\u000a    Professor Chris Gratton, joined SHU 1997, Professor 1997-2012\u000d\u000a      Professor Simon Shibli, joined SHU 1999, Principal Lecturer 2000,\u000d\u000a      Professor 2007+\u000d\u000a      Richard Coleman, joined SHU 1999, Principal Research Fellow 2003+\u000d\u000a      Girish Ramchandani, joined SHU 2004, Research Fellow 2009, Senior Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow 2013\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15983","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The 'Booster' trial research confirmed the efficacy of a DVD intervention\u000a      to promote physical activity in sedentary individuals in deprived areas.\u000a      This research evidence led Drs Copeland and Crank to produce another DVD\u000a      intervention as part of a Barnsley NHS\/local authority commissioned\u000a      service in 2009 (grant b). The service &#8212; 'Be Active' (designed, delivered\u000a      and project managed by SHU staff &#8212; Copeland and Crank) &#8212; represented a\u000a      community based behaviour change intervention to increase physical\u000a      activity in overweight individuals and their families in nine of the most\u000a      deprived areas of Barnsley. Barnsley has been identified as a borough of\u000a      poor health with 34% (67,000 individuals) of the adult population\u000a      estimated to be overweight and a further 73,000 obese. Furthermore, the\u000a      2008\/9 Active People Survey ranked Barnsley in the bottom 25% nationally\u000a      for participation in regular activity.\u000a    The primary objective of 'Be Active' was to increase the physical\u000a      activity of overweight adults and to reduce their cardiovascular risk. A\u000a      total of 7,206 individuals from 4,815 households in the most deprived\u000a      areas of Barnsley received a copy of the DVD. According to a senior\u000a      officer at Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council (MBC) (source i below) \"this\u000a        was a considerable achievement, bearing in mind that all of these people\u000a        were considered to be hard to reach\". Of all participants, 72% were\u000a      female and the mean age of recipients was 38 years. The impact of the DVD\u000a      was assessed as part of an overall service evaluation conducted by SHU\u000a      (see end of section for reference).\u000a    In sum, 92% of individuals self-reported watching the DVD, of whom 93%\u000a      confirmed they were more active as a result. Data also revealed a\u000a      significant and beneficial effect over time of the programme, for weight\u000a      (p=0.001), BMI (p=0.001), waist circumference (p=0.001) and blood pressure\u000a      (systolic: p=0.001 and diastolic p=0.003). In real terms this equates to a\u000a      mean weight loss per person of 3kg, a reduction in waist circumference of\u000a      over 4cm, and a fall in BMI of 0.95units. Importantly, the 'Be Active'\u000a      data is also based on a relatively long term follow-up (6 months). A\u000a      senior manager from Small Changes Ltd (source ii) who also delivers weight\u000a      management services in Barnsley reported \"the long-term changes noted\u000a        in the data are encouraging and underline the impact of the DVD on the\u000a        maintainance of behavioural changes made by participants. Sustained\u000a        change is likely to have a positive and lasting impact on the health\u000a        profile of some of the most challenging areas of Barnsley\". Case\u000a      studies from the programme can be seen at http:\/\/beactive.org.uk\/case-studies\/\u000a      along with other `active ingredients' from the DVD which has been\u000a      translated into an on-line format and embedded within Barnsley MBC's\u000a      leisure services programme (see \u000a        www.beactive.org.uk). This work was also undertaken by Copeland and\u000a      Crank and has enhanced the reach and sustainability of the intervention.\u000a    In broader terms, data from Sport England's Active People Survey\u000a      highlight the contribution 'Be Active' made towards adult physical\u000a      activity participation in Barnsley. The data for Barnsley showed an\u000a      increase from 19.1% to 22.4% of adults participating in 3 x 30 minutes\u000a      physical activity per week (National Indicator 8 &#8212; Change between APS1\u000a      (Oct05-Oct 06) and APS4\/5 (Oct 09-Oct 11)). To strengthen this evidence,\u000a      trend data from Department of Health (2011) taken between 2009 and 2011\u000a      (the time period of 'Be Active') confirms physical activity in adults\u000a      increased from 8.3% to 12.1%. This places Barnsley above the national\u000a      average for the first time. Whilst causal links between physical activity\u000a      increases in Barnsley and `Be Active' must be treated with caution (in\u000a      that we did not control for extraneous variables within the research\u000a      design), the data is nevertheless encouraging. Moreover, as inferred by\u000a      the testimony above from the senior officer at Barnsley MBC (source i\u000a      below), the DVD approach had a positive and significant impact on the\u000a      reach of local service providers (i.e. NHS Barnsley, Active Barnsley,\u000a      Barnsley FC, Barnsley MBC) by providing each of these with an\u000a      evidence-based `behaviour change tool' to engage typically hard-to-reach\u000a      communities. In doing so `Be Active' supported the aforementioned agencies\u000a      to meet health improvement targets specified within Department of Health,\u000a      local NHS and Public Health England outcome frameworks.\u000a    This impact is further corroborated by a Senior Health Improvement\u000a      Specialist from Barnsley MBC (Source iii below) who suggested \"the Be\u000a        Active programme not only demonstrated a significant impact on those who\u000a        were in receipt of the programme (in terms of their health profile) but\u000a        also on those who are connected to the delivery of physical activity\u000a        services across Barnsley. I can say with confidence that introducing an\u000a        evidence-based approach to engendering physical activity behaviour\u000a        change through the DVD, positively influenced the culture of provision\u000a        in the Borough as well as framing policy decisions and commissioning\u000a        approaches moving forwards. Providers and commissioners of services in\u000a        Barnsley are working differently as a result of `Be Active' and this is\u000a        one of the key achievements of the programme\".\u000a    The impact of the research informing the 'Be Active' DVD also has a\u000a      broader reach, driven by the following:\u000a    \u000a      Publication in a practice-based journal with a circulation list of\u000a        5,500 (Copeland, R.J., Crank, H, Hall, A., &amp; Millbourn.

The challenge in\u000a      getting individuals to become more active, more often, remains a public\u000a      health priority. Recently the evidence base for brief interventions to\u000a      promote physical activity in primary care has been reviewed (NICE, 2006).\u000a      This review pointed to a sufficient evidence base for NICE to recommend\u000a      the use of brief interventions to promote physical activity, but also\u000a      identified specific evidence gaps, particularly in relation to\u000a      cost-effectiveness of interventions, delivery costs to the NHS and the\u000a      challenge of engaging those most in need of brief advice. In July 2008,\u000a      researchers at Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) were awarded a National\u000a      Institute for Health Research &#8212; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) grant\u000a      (grant a), in partnership with University of Sheffield (UoS) to explore\u000a      the effectiveness of physical activity 'Booster' sessions (telephone-based\u000a      motivational interviewing or full-booster face-to-face motivational\u000a      interviewing) to help maintain physical activity in previously sedentary\u000a      individuals in deprived communities in Sheffield. The HTA has a rigorous\u000a      scientific and peer review process. Copeland (site Principal\u000a      Investigator), Breckon and Crank from SHU designed and delivered the\u000a      physical activity counselling Booster interventions and designed an\u000a      innovative behaviour change DVD (informed by references 4 and 5) as a\u000a      brief intervention designed to increase physical activity in the target\u000a      population. UoS researchers undertook trial management and the\u000a      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis.\u000a    The 'Booster' trial was carried out in two phases: a feasibility study to\u000a      establish the acceptability of the DVD and determine recruitment rates\u000a      (reference 3); and a three arm randomised controlled trial to establish\u000a      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (reference 2). After watching the DVD\u000a      79% of eligible participants successfully increased their physical\u000a      activity by at least 30-minutes per week, making them eligible for the\u000a      booster interventions. In the main trial, three months after receiving the\u000a      DVD, 50.8% successfully increased their physical activity.\u000a    Results from the main trial showed a mean total energy expenditure (TEE)\u000a      (KCal) per day difference of 39.0 Kcal (2265 KCal vs. 2226.9 KCal; 95%CI:\u000a      &#8212;173.4 to 95.4; p=0.567) in favour of the DVD (identified in the trial as\u000a      the control arm of the study) compared to Booster interventions combined.\u000a      The observed mean difference in mean TEE per day was similar and\u000a      consistent in favour of the DVD group even after adjusting for age, sex,\u000a      BMI, total minutes of physical activity at brief intervention and\u000a      pre-trial screening, and health related quality of life based on SF12\u000a      total scores. The HTA study provided a robust evidence-base that supported\u000a      the use of the DVD tool to access hard-to-reach populations in need of\u000a      brief health intervention.\u000a    In order to meet policy and practice needs, members of the SHU team drew\u000a      on their physical activity research expertise further to inform the design\u000a      of the DVD. Crank was a co-author on the expert physical activity\u000a      consensus statement (reference 1). Breckon's expertise as an international\u000a      motivational interviewing trainer (MINT) and Copeland's expertise in\u000a      behaviour change interventions in overweight and obesity research\u000a      (reference 6) ensured that only peer-reviewed content and behaviour change\u000a      techniques consistent with NICE (2007) guidance were adopted.\u000a    The key researchers, their positions at the time of the research and\u000a      their current status are as follows:\u000a    Dr Robert Copeland: joined SHU 4\/3\/2002, Principal Research Fellow at the\u000a      time of the research; currently Reader, from 2012\u000a    Dr Jeff Breckon: joined SHU 1\/1\/2004, Principal Research Fellow at the\u000a      time of the research; currently Reader, from 2010\u000a    Dr Helen Crank: joined SHU 16\/10\/2002, Senior Research Fellow at the time\u000a      of the research; currently Principal Research Fellow, from 2011\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15984","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society","Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of CSER's public engagement is an increased awareness by the\u000a      public of sports science and engineering research.

Research expertise in\u000a      aerodynamics and mechanics (references 1, 3, 5), contextual knowledge\u000a      (reference 6) and an ability to create innovative public engagement events\u000a      were used to develop presentations for each sport with expert\u000a      practitioners.\u000a    Following the debate at each event, an electronic system was used to ask\u000a      a set of questions and collect answers from audience members (source 1).\u000a      The total audience was 560 and analysis of the answers showed the\u000a      following: 61% were male and the age range was normally distributed around\u000a      a mode of 31-45 years. Almost all (89% to 98%) thought that science was\u000a      beneficial to sport and only around 13% thought that the use of technology\u000a      was the same as doping (with drugs). Around two thirds agreed with the\u000a      general statement that \"as well as natural talent, sport should be a test\u000a      of how an athlete can exploit technology\".\u000a    This was the only RCUK Olympic activity in 2012 (source 2) and the RCUK\u000a      evaluation report (Cutting Edge 2012: The Research behind Sport Evaluation\u000a      Report, v 3.0) showed that 100% of the audience (who filled in a\u000a      questionnaire) enjoyed the events. Only 2% of respondents were unable to\u000a      understand the scientific content of the events, while 85% found the\u000a      speakers `clear and easy to understand', `interesting and engaging' and\u000a      `thought provoking.

Haake and Goodwill carried out industrially\u000a      sponsored research (grant a) to develop a dynamic model of a tennis shot\u000a      using finite element analysis (reference 1). The model had a frame,\u000a      interlocking strings and a ball with a 2-shell structure and internal air\u000a      bag. The model was validated experimentally using a bespoke impact test\u000a      rig to look at effects such as friction on ball impact with the racket or\u000a      the court (reference 2). The work showed that impacts with the court were\u000a      directly affected by the friction coefficient, while those with the racket\u000a      depended both on the coefficient and the complex movement of the strings.\u000a      Choppin et al (reference 3) used photogrammetric techniques to\u000a      look at the spin, speed and angle of the racket and ball during play and\u000a      showed that most players sought to hit the node point of the racket where\u000a      vibrations would not be imparted to the racket.\u000a    Aerodynamics research: Haake, Goodwill and Carr&#233; (reference 3)\u000a      created a new measure of roughness to predict the aerodynamic performance\u000a      of sports balls. This sought to create a simple non-dimensional parameter\u000a      to characterise the different features of sports balls with nap (i.e.\u000a      tennis), dimples (golf), or leather (football). The researchers found that\u000a      the statistical measure of skewness of a surface was able to characterise\u000a      the drag coefficient with the Reynolds number (airflow speed), giving a\u000a      simple method for sports ball analysis.\u000a    3D Motion Capture. Methods to measure motion of a tennis ball were\u000a      developed for laboratory, (reference 1), and for real, environments\u000a      (reference 4), which supported the development of systems for UK Sport\u000a      (grant b). This research showed that capture of useful 2D and 3D\u000a      information in ecologically valid environments relied on a robust and\u000a      practical camera calibration system, for which the planar calibration\u000a      system was developed.\u000a    Performance improvement analysis. Haake, James and Foster\u000a      (references 5 and 6) studied the statistics of performance since the early\u000a      1900s to determine the impact of technology on sporting performance in\u000a      Olympic sports. A new measure was created called the Performance\u000a      Improvement Index, based on energy expenditure, as a way of comparing\u000a      performances across different disciplines. It was found that 4% of the\u000a      sprint was attributed to technology, while in sports such as pole vault or\u000a      javelin, technology affected sport by around 30%. The 1-hour cycling\u000a      record improved by around 100% with the introduction of new bicycles. The\u000a      research was expanded and deepened for use in public engagement through an\u000a      EPSRC Senior Media Fellowship (grant c) and a Royal Academy of Engineering\u000a      Public Engagement Fellowship (grant d).\u000a    All staff cited above, except Carr&#233;, were employed by Sheffield Hallam\u000a      University as follows:\u000a    \u000a       Allen T, Senior Sports Engineer, 1\/6\/09-1\/9\/11; Senior Lecturer\u000a        1\/9\/11 onwards;\u000a       Choppin, S, Sports Engineer, 1\/6\/09 onwards;\u000a       Foster, L, Sports Engineer, 2\/4\/11 onwards;\u000a       Goodwill, SR, Senior Sports Engineer, 1\/3\/06 onwards;\u000a       Haake SJ, Professor of Sports Engineering, 1\/3\/06 onwards;\u000a       James DM, Senior Lecturer, 1\/3\/06 onwards.\u000a       Carr&#233;, M, Lecturer, Sheffield University, 1\/3\/06 onwards.

CESR used the camera and photogrammetric\u000a      expertise developed in tennis to create calibrated measurement systems for\u000a      use in day-to-day training and coaching. These systems used the planar\u000a      calibration technique (references 2, 3) to allow measurement in large\u000a      volumes and tracking algorithms (reference 5) developed in tennis to track\u000a      athletes. Systems generally had the following characteristics: coaches\u000a      found them simple to use; they employed automated video analysis; they\u000a      provided storage and retrieval; and the analysis they generated gave a\u000a      performance advantage.\u000a    Examples are as follows:\u000a    \u000a      GB Boxing required CSER to instrument the new GB Boxing Gym at the EIS\u000a        in Sheffield with a 5-camera system called iBoxer. The system\u000a        allowed boxing analytics to be developed over and above tracking across\u000a        the ring. This included punch rates during a round and the strategic\u000a        analysis of opponents. The GB Boxing performance analyst said \"the\u000a          data suggests that this kind of preparation increases the boxer's\u000a          success rate by around 25%\" (http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-18735629).\u000a        GB Boxing won 5 medals at London 2012.\u000a      GB Taekwondo installed iTaekwondo at its gym in Manchester and was a\u000a        derivative of iBoxer. The EIS performance analyst said of the system, \"It\u000a          has been a pleasure collaborating with you on the project to produce a\u000a          very innovative, and truly world leading product that I can\u000a          confidently say puts GB Taekwondo and myself at the cutting edge of\u000a          the sport in the run up to 2012\" (by email, 11th Feb\u000a        2010). Taekwondo won 3 medals at London 2012.\u000a      British Gymnastics required a camera and review system for its gym at\u000a        Lilleshall. CSER developed a system with calibrated cameras and simple\u000a        player tracking to allow coaches to review technique and actions of its\u000a        gymnasts. The EIS performance analyst said, \"iGym has enabled video\u000a          feedback during training for all squad gymnasts providing them with a\u000a          tool to aid skill development and polishing of routine work. The high\u000a          speed automatic capture system on two vaults is the most impressive\u000a          part of the system which serves as such a powerful tool replaying the\u000a          fast movement to both gymnast and coach...A very successful project.\"\u000a        Gymnastics won 3 medals at London 2012.\u000a    \u000a    Over 30 systems have been developed for UK Sport (source 1) and this\u000a      success has led to further UK Sport\/EIS funding (grants d, e) and a UK\u000a      Sport Innovation Prize (grant f). Following London 2012, Dr Goodwill\u000a      received a personal letter from the CEO of UK Sport (1\/11\/2012: source 2)\u000a      which said, \"Without a doubt, the projects delivered have contributed\u000a        to the medal success we have seen in London, Vancouver, Beijing, Turin\u000a        and as far back as Athens in 2004. In the current funding review process\u000a        as part of the Rio vision, many of the sports have highlighted the\u000a        support and the benefits of the numerous projects in partnership with\u000a        Sheffield Hallam University and the team of scientists and engineers. It\u000a        is no coincidence that your name is continually linked to these\u000a        projects.\"\u000a    In March 2013, Wheat was commissioned by EIS Manchester to design and\u000a      build a bespoke apparatus using low-cost depth cameras to measure the body\u000a      shape of Olympic athletes (grant g). The first prototype was tested in\u000a      July at EIS Manchester and is being used to track the development of elite\u000a      athletes. Additionally, CSER was awarded the following peer-reviewed\u000a      prizes for this work: (1) Sports Analytics Innovation Awards, Sports\u000a      Analytics Research Institution of the Year Award (March 2013); (2) PODIUM\u000a      Awards, RCUK Award for Exceptional Research Contribution. Silver Medal\u000a      (May 2012).\u000a    Support for the International Tennis Federation\u000a      The ITF has implemented much of CSER's research within its systems for\u000a      monitoring the nature of the sport. The work on the measurement of spin\u000a      (references 4, 5) has been implemented in the software SpinDoctor\u000a      which has been used by the ITF to monitor the game: it was used at the\u000a      Davis Cup (2010, 2011, 2012), the ATP Masters in London (2012, 2013) and\u000a      at Wimbledon (2011, 2012, 2013) with a total of 3,437 shots analysed. The\u000a      spin rig used in references 4 and 5 has been coupled to a database to\u000a      allow the ITF to assess the effect of new strings and stringing methods on\u000a      spin generation by specific rackets. The results of this work were\u000a      presented to the ITF Technical Commission (source 3) from 2010 (on which\u000a      Prof Haake is a voting member) whose role it is to monitor the game and\u000a      assess the appropriateness of the rules of tennis to technology. The use\u000a      of SpinDoctor and the spin rig showed that spin generated by\u000a      professional players is significantly less than that of the `spaghetti\u000a      racket' which was banned in 1980; the ITF will continually monitor the\u000a      amount of spin in the game, using Rule 4 (The Racket) to temper excessive\u000a      spin. Prof Haake's expertise in performance analysis systems and\u000a      experience from UK Sport were used to inform the Technical Commission and\u000a      the introduction of a new rule to tennis (Rule 31) at its AGM on 12th\u000a      July 2013. This rule allows the use of performance analysis technology in\u000a      tournament play for the first time and will come into force on 1st\u000a      January 2014.\u000a    Supporting commercial and health organisations\u000a      The understanding of dynamics developed in references 1 and 2 and funded\u000a      by Prince (grant a) was used by Prince to improve its understanding of\u000a      tennis racket performance from 2006 onwards and supported its growth to\u000a      number one racket manufacturer by 2010. The improvements in measurement\u000a      techniques described in references 2, 3, and 5 were developed by CSER\u000a      staff into tools that could be used by our commercial partners.\u000a    SpinDoctor was sold to Prince, IsoSport and adidas to use in their\u000a      labs (with the ITF receiving 25% of royalties) to allow the measurement of\u000a      scalar spin in the field. adidas requested a further system for its\u000a      football testing with the ability to give 3D spin vectors and used the\u000a      camera calibration and tracking systems outlined in references 3 and 5.\u000a      Since 2011, footballs have been tested using the system, enhancing adidas'\u000a      ability to develop its products (source 4). Tracking and signal processing\u000a      techniques (reference 3) were also used to develop an iPhone application\u000a      for adidas (Snapshot) to automatically measure the speed, angle and\u000a      trajectory of a kick. The application had been downloaded around 300,000\u000a      times (31\/7\/2013) and is the first analysis App developed by adidas.\u000a    CSER is also working with Labosport to test the Goal-Line Technology\u000a      systems being installed at Premier League clubs around the UK. The work\u000a      uses techniques from references 2, 4 and 5 to measure simulated goals\u000a      according to FIFA protocols. CSER staff have been accredited by FIFA to\u000a      carry out the work and all 2012-13 Premier League clubs have been assessed\u000a      and passed by CSER according to the FIFA specifications.\u000a    The depth-camera work has also been transferred into the commercial and\u000a      health sector. Wheat (grant h) has been commissioned to build a low cost\u000a      scanning device for Oxylane (Decathlon) for installation in its stores and\u000a      also for breast clinics in collaboration with a Senior Breast Surgeon at\u000a      the Royal Derby Hospital (grant h; source 5). The significance of the\u000a      latter work allowed it to win 3rd prize in the 2012 Health\u000a      Enterprise East Awards, Medical Technology &amp; Software category. Heller\u000a      used depth cameras to allow older people to enhance their physical\u000a      capabilities by interacting with virtual worlds (\"2nd Lives for\u000a      the 3rd Age). This work has been used as a case study to inform\u000a      the research community on the future of research through a Parliamentary\u000a      report on `Assistive Technology 2010-11' and a RCUK report (6\/2011) on `UK\u000a      Research that will have a Profound Effect on our Future'.\u000a    Dissemination of research findings to the research community\u000a      The work of Goodwill, Choppin, Haake and Kelley showed that planar\u000a      calibration was superior to the more commonly used DLT for in situ\u000a      environments.

These models were validated experimentally using a bespoke impact\u000a      rig with 3D photogrammetry to measure the complex motion of the racket and\u000a      ball. The finite element model in reference 1 was the first to simulate\u000a      accurately oblique-spinning off- centre impacts with a racket.\u000a    Allen used his model to look at the effect of tennis racket parameters on\u000a      simulated ground-strokes showing that mass distribution rather than racket\u000a      stiffness was the most important parameter. The work also highlighted the\u000a      need to measure what happens during real play on a tennis court and\u000a      Choppin et al. (2010; reference 2) used two high speed cameras and\u000a      the planar calibration method to determine racket and ball motion at\u000a      Wimbledon qualifiers. The work required the development of in-situ\u000a      techniques with minimal interaction with the player to produce detail 3D\u000a      information on the motion and dynamics of the racket and ball during play.\u000a    In parallel to this between 2006 and 2010, research was sponsored by the\u000a      ITF (grant b) to create a method of automatically measuring ball spin\u000a      during play. The work was used to develop laboratory systems at the ITF to\u000a      determine the overall physics of spin generation in tennis (references 4,\u000a      5) using the knowledge of real play conditions. This work determined the\u000a      effect of impact spin, speed and angle on rackets with 6 different string\u000a      types with a wide range of friction coefficients. Multiple regression\u000a      analysis showed that rebound was extremely complex and depended upon\u000a      whether strings slipped throughout impact. Thus, friction between strings\u000a      was much more important than friction between the strings and the ball.\u000a    The work described here marks a transition from lab-based studies to\u000a      measurement in real environments. References 1, 2 and 3, between 2010 and\u000a      2013, showed that capture of useful 2D and 3D information in the field\u000a      relies on a robust and practical camera calibration system, for which the\u000a      planar calibration system was developed. The research demonstrated that\u000a      planar calibration was superior to Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) in\u000a      many real-life scenarios because reconstruction errors were smaller, the\u000a      calibration object was simpler to use and errors scaled with the\u000a      environment.\u000a    The work has moved into the research of low-cost off-the-shelf systems\u000a      using depth cameras (such as the Kinect). In 2013, Choppin and Wheat\u000a      (reference 6) explored the potential of these systems to measure body\u000a      segment parameters, body segment angles and player tracking over a large\u000a      volume. They showed that the centre mass position over a principal moments\u000a      of inertia could be measured with root mean square error to &#177;3% using a\u000a      Kinect (compared to a 12-camera motion capture system). While the overall\u000a      accuracy was not good enough for all biomechanical analysis, it was shown\u000a      that systems are capable of useful field measurements which will become\u000a      more accurate as hardware improves.\u000a    The status of the researchers at Sheffield Hallam University is:\u000a    \u000a      Allen T, Senior Sports Engineer, 1\/6\/09-1\/9\/11; Senior Lecturer 1\/9\/11\u000a        onwards;\u000a      Choppin, S, Sports Engineer, 1\/6\/09 onwards;\u000a      Goodwill, SR, Senior sports engineer, 1\/3\/06 onwards;\u000a      Haake SJ, Professor of Sports Engineering, 1\/3\/06 onwards;\u000a      Kelley J, Sports Engineer 1\/8\/10 onwards\u000a      Wheat J, Senior Research Fellow 1\/8\/10-31\/8\/12, Principal Research\u000a        Fellow 1\/9\/12 onwards.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17135","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    a) Heat acclimation\u000d\u000a    Dr Sunderland's research has changed international protocols and\u000d\u000a      practices and so improved the\u000d\u000a      performance of a wide range of sportsmen and women ranging from\u000d\u000a      international hockey players\u000d\u000a      and elite athletes to school teams and individuals engaged in charity\u000d\u000a      events.\u000d\u000a    Throughout the REF period, GB Hockey have used Dr Sunderland's\u000d\u000a      acclimation process and\u000d\u000a      sought her advice in preparation for all tournaments in hot environments\u000d\u000a      including the 2008 Beijing\u000d\u000a      Olympic Games.

The\u000d\u000a      maintenance of hydration status (euhydration rather than hypo- or\u000d\u000a      hyperhydration) is imperative to\u000d\u000a      both physical and skill performance improvement and therefore success.

The Head Coach Wales Hockey stated, \"Dr\u000d\u000a        Caroline Sunderland\u000d\u000a        provided us with highly effective strategies for training, recovery and\u000d\u000a        nutrition for playing at the\u000d\u000a        Delhi Commonwealth Games.

Findings\u000d\u000a      indicated that the cooling collar may improve performance, but not\u000d\u000a      necessarily `feel good', which\u000d\u000a      has important implications for application (Minniti, Tyler &amp;\u000d\u000a      Sunderland. Eur J Sports Sci 11(6), pp\u000d\u000a      419-429). Previous research had focussed on pre-cooling or non-practical\u000d\u000a      cooling during exercise.\u000d\u000a      Based on her understanding of how the brain regulates exercise performance\u000d\u000a      in the heat, Dr\u000d\u000a      Sunderland hypothesised that cooling the neck region, which has high\u000d\u000a      alliesthesial\u000d\u000a      thermosensitivity, would provide the basis for a practical approach to\u000d\u000a      improving performance. Her\u000d\u000a      hypothesis was proven, leading to the development of a neck-cooling\u000d\u000a      collar, which has been\u000d\u000a      adopted and used by other researchers, attracting media attention\u000d\u000a      worldwide.\u000d\u000a    c) Improving hockey performance\u000d\u000a    Dr Sunderland's research demonstrated that:\u000d\u000a    1) Field hockey skill and decision-making in international hockey players\u000d\u000a      competing in hot\u000d\u000a      environments is diminished with approximately 2% hypohydration.

The research has had impact on international policy through\u000a      the reach of its theoretical analyses of how sport for development\u000a      `problems' are conceptualized and addressed.\u000a    \u000a      Following her 2010 critique of sport for development for the IOC's Olympic\u000a          Review, Kay was invited to present her argument for the\u000a        reorientation of Sport for Development and Peace (SDP) in an address to\u000a        the 2nd International UN\/IOC Forum on Sport, Peace and\u000a        Development (Geneva, May 2011) [A], attended by the UN Secretary\u000a        General, the IOC, the Commonwealth Advisory Board On Sport (CABOS), and\u000a        &gt;300 Ministerial and NOC representatives. Kay's accompanying\u000a        5,000-word position paper detailed the case for SDP to adopt the\u000a        principles of international development by promoting models of sport for\u000a        development that prioritised Global South interests and were locally\u000a        led, and set out guidelines for this approach. The paper was later\u000a        circulated by UK Sport to its partner agencies to inform future SDP\u000a        work.\u000a      Kay has worked especially closely with the Commonwealth bodies. In\u000a        October 2011 she was the academic contributor to the Commonwealth\u000a        Secretariat's seminar to assess the potential for sport to be adopted as\u000a        a Secretariat-wide development tool, attended by the Deputy General and\u000a        lead staff of the Health, Education, Youth and Human Rights divisions.\u000a        In December 2011 Brunel convened a two-day symposium to offer a `safe\u000a        space' for discussion of the issues and challenges encountered in\u000a        research and practice in sport for development. Fourteen participants\u000a        from eight countries took part, including staff of the Commonwealth\u000a        Secretariat and UK Sport; the Chair and members of CABOS; and academics\u000a        from Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Tanzania and Ghana. The\u000a        Leverhulme Developing Sustainable Sport in Africa project, to\u000a        which Kay is an advisor, also participated. The outcomes of the Brunel\u000a        meeting were cited in presentations by Commonwealth Secretariat staff to\u000a        the 2012 CABOS meeting, and incorporated in a resource paper provided\u000a        for participants in the 2012 Expert Working Group meeting.\u000a      In March 2012 Kay was commissioned as consultant and lead author of\u000a        the Commonwealth Guide to Advancing Development through Sport\u000a        (with O. Dudfield, 2013) for CABOS [B]. The Guide identified\u000a        relevant policies, assessed the strength of evidence on the value of\u000a        sport to support of them, and provided a framework for implementation.\u000a        The Guide was ratified by the Sixth Commonwealth Sport Ministers Meeting\u000a        (6CSMM; July 2012) [C]. The meeting endorsed the Guide and requested the\u000a        Commonwealth Secretariat to work with identified member countries to\u000a        utilise the Commonwealth framework, and other key international policy\u000a        documents, as a basis for national action planning projects.\u000a      The 2013 annual meeting of CABOS addressed the next stage in\u000a        operationalizing the Guide's recommendations through Agenda items to \"Note\u000a        the production, endorsement and publication of the Commonwealth\u000a        Guidelines on Advancing Development through Sport\" and \"Provide\u000a        advice on how Commonwealth Member Governments and other stakeholders\u000a        can maximise the use of the Guide\". The Chair stated that \"In\u000a        recognising the challenge of transitioning policy declarations into\u000a        action CABOS highlighted the Commonwealth Guide to Advancing\u000a        Development through Sport as an effective advocacy instrument,\u000a        guiding framework and analysis tool for governments looking to create an\u000a        enabling environment for Sport for Development and Peace. Concurrently,\u000a        CABOS commended the lead taken by the Governments of Barbados, Rwanda\u000a        and Sri Lanka in using the Commonwealth guidelines and framework in\u000a        national SDP planning efforts supported through technical assistance\u000a        from the Commonwealth Secretariat. CABOS welcomed the Government of\u000a        Belize referencing this framework in the revision of their national\u000a        sport policy and invited other countries to follow suit\".\u000a    \u000a    B. The research has had direct impact on sport for development at local\u000a          delivery level, and this has further which has informed the\u000a      policy guidance detailed above.\u000a    \u000a      Work with Go Sisters has increased local M+E and research\u000a          capacity. The project's data collection and research training\u000a        needs were jointly identified by Go Sisters, IN and the\u000a        researchers, and resources for 10 separate data collection\u000a        exercises provided, supported by training workshops in data collection,\u000a        data analysis and reporting, delivered by the researchers. These allowed\u000a        Go Sisters staff and peer leaders to obtain 2,406 usable\u000a        completed questionnaire surveys and interviews between 2010-13.\u000a      \u000aGo Sisters has made increasing use of the research\u000a        findings and developed a self-critical, reflective organisational\u000a          culture recognised within and outside EduSport (e.g. External\u000a        Evaluation report to DFID). The research partnership approach has\u000a        allowed M+E to become integral to programme learning and management and\u000a        valued for its contributions. The annual interpretive research reports\u000a        to IN have been reviewed with Go Sisters, and the implications\u000a        discussed. Contributions have been made to work practices, e.g.\u000a        extension of the programme to entrepreneurship activities in response to\u000a        issues raised in interviews by the most experienced peer leaders.\u000a      EduSport and external partners have also noted how the research has\u000a        given additional profile to the programme, aiding partnership\u000a        building and funding bids. The Brunel PI collaborated with IN and the Go\u000a          Sisters Zambian project manager to develop a successful &#163;546,623\u000a        funding bid to Comic Relief for further programme expansion over\u000a        2013-18, informed by the research findings from 2009-12. In August 2013,\u000a        the Brunel PI and RA partnered with the Go Sisters Zambian project\u000a        manager to deliver a workshop on research and practice lessons from Go\u000a        Sisters on the use of sport to empower young women to an international\u000a        audience at the Commonwealth Games Conference, Glasgow.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In the last decade, sport has earned unprecedented recognition in\u000a      international policy circles as a tool to support international\u000a      development. Nonetheless, many have challenged this `new social movement'\u000a      (Kidd, 2008), concerned by its uncritical application of Global North\u000a      models of sport to Global South contexts. Addressing these concerns,\u000a      Brunel researchers and collaborators have drawn on the field of\u000a      international development studies to investigate how principles of local\u000a      ownership and partnership can be applied to sport. Since 2010, empirical\u000a      studies and critical conceptual analyses have contributed to this.\u000a      Specifically through building organisational capacity at local level,\u000a      supporting partnership between funders and recipient organisations, and\u000a      developing national as well as international policy guidance to ensure\u000a      community level experiences and perspectives are represented in sport for\u000a      development policy and strategies.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    BRUNEL UNIVERSITY (H0113)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Brunel University","InstitutionName":"Brunel University","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10000961}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2660646","Name":"Genève"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Since 2010 this area of work has been led by Tess Kay and\u000a      includes both primary (empirical qualitative and quantitative studies) and\u000a      secondary (research reviews, conceptual analyses and policy guidance)\u000a      work. The two areas of work have been complementary and mutually\u000a      reinforcing. During the assessment period empirical studies have been\u000a      undertaken with UK-funded sport for development programmes operating in\u000a      single or multiple countries, and these have contributed to the conceptual\u000a      analyses that has provided transnational policy guidance.\u000a    Kay's research at Brunel has developed alternatives to the paradigms and\u000a      methods that dominated early, hierarchical approaches to monitoring and\u000a      evaluation (M+E) and research in sport for development (see Refs 1, 3, 5,\u000a      6). It has analysed the contribution these systems make to sustaining\u000a      donor-recipient relations and maintaining dependency in local partner\u000a      organisations in sport for development (Refs 1, 3, 5). It has also\u000a      addressed the limitations of such approaches for assessing the\u000a      contribution of sport to social change (Refs 2, 4). The work draws on\u000a      Kay's early experiences of contrasting research approaches in empirical\u000a      studies of sport for development programmes in Zambia (2006, 2007), Brazil\u000a      (2008), India (2008) and St. Lucia (2009). Moreover, it draws on her\u000a      experiences as co-investigator during the monitoring and evaluation of\u000a      Phase 1 of the International development (Olympic Legacy) five-country\u000a      study (2008-11). These highlighted the feasibility and value of\u000a      incorporating locally grounded participatory and collaborative mixed\u000a      method research, including qualitative data collection (Refs 1, 2, 4, 5,\u000a      7) while also revealing the limitations of undertaking empirical work that\u000a      did not include these.\u000a    Brunel's research has addressed how these issues manifest at community\u000a      delivery level in work undertaken by Kay (PI) with co-investigators Jeanes\u000a      (Monash, 2009-10), Mansfield (Brunel, since 2011) and Palmer-Felgate\u000a      (Brunel, 2013) in an in-depth two-phase (2009-13; 2013-18) empirical study\u000a      working with Zambian NGO EduSport on the Go Sisters girls'\u000a      empowerment project. The empirical research has supported Go Sisters'\u000a      expansion over a 5-year period 2008-13, funded by &#163;400,000 from DFID and\u000a      managed by International Inspiration (IN; previously IDS, from a single\u000a      city (Lusaka) to national rollout to four of Zambia's seven provinces).\u000a      Brunel has worked in partnership with the Go Sisters staff team to\u000a      develop organisational capacity to fulfil the monitoring and evaluation\u000a      requirements of the funder (IN and DFID), by providing training and\u000a      resources to build research capacity to equip Go Sisters to carry\u000a      out data collection, processing and reporting. Research tools have been\u000a      designed in consultation with Go Sisters. Since 2010, four field\u000a      visits have been undertaken, more than 2,500 questionnaires completed and\u000a      more than 100 interviews undertaken.\u000a    Brunel's conceptual analyses of policy and programme management in sport\u000a      for development have been informed by an expert symposium and two research\u000a      studies conducted with policymakers and providers from both the sport and\u000a      international development sectors. These have drawn on the development\u000a      sector's principles for participatory, collaborative and bottom-up models\u000a      of development that facilitate local ownership of projects and programmes.\u000a      These issues were the focus of a two-day international symposium convened\u000a      by BC.SHaW in 2011, attended by senior policy makers, advisors and\u000a      academics from eight countries. In 2012 Prof Kay undertook research for\u000a      the Commonwealth Secretariat, conducting documentary analysis and policy\u000a      interviews with the Health, Education, Youth and Human Rights divisions of\u000a      the Commonwealth Secretariat to identify policy goals and objectives for\u000a      these areas, to which sport might realistically contribute. In 2013,\u000a      Brunel researchers undertook a further study of organisational capacity\u000a      building in sport for development for an External Evaluation of the Go\u000a        Sisters programme commissioned for DFID (Ref 7) and again involving\u000a      documentary analysis and policy and management interviews an assessment.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19862","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The West Midlands has consistently reported above the national UK average\u000d\u000a      for overweight and obese children based on National Child Measurement\u000d\u000a      Programme (NCMP) data with, for example, 21.2% of year 6 pupils measured\u000d\u000a      being recorded as obese for the year 2011\/12 (against a national average\u000d\u000a      of 19.2%).i Weight management programmes are a key part of the\u000d\u000a        strategy adopted by West Midlands Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to combat\u000d\u000a        this problem. A significant contribution of the research has been to\u000d\u000a        improve the delivery of child weight management programmes by PCTs\u000d\u000a        across the West Midlands. In addition, it has led to changes in practice\u000d\u000a        relating to the NCMP and it influenced the development of the\u000d\u000a        Worcestershire Childhood Obesity Strategy and Action Plan 2008-11.\u000d\u000a    The evaluation study was central to the first of these impacts (though it\u000d\u000a      must be stressed that this study itself was underpinned by Peters'\u000d\u000a      previous work on the value of anthropometrical measures). Key outcomes of\u000d\u000a      the evaluation were a set of recommendations for commissioners of weight\u000d\u000a      management programmes (Source A) and a toolkit of validated\u000d\u000a      measures for use by programme leads (Source B). In February 2010,\u000d\u000a      the research team presented the findings from the evaluation at a workshop\u000d\u000a      held by the Department of Health West Midlands (DoHWM) which was attended\u000d\u000a      by 65 weight management programme leads, commissioners, health improvement\u000d\u000a      specialists and others involved in developing, running and evaluating\u000d\u000a      public health interventions from across the region (Source C).\u000d\u000a      DoHWM published a document in March 2011 setting out the legacy of its\u000d\u000a      Healthy Weight programme which describes in detail the impact of the\u000d\u000a      evaluation (Source D). At a general level, it is stated that the\u000d\u000a      evaluation enabled Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to improve measurement, data\u000d\u000a      collection and evaluation within their programmes (with concomitant\u000d\u000a      benefits for those children and families engaged in the programmes);\u000d\u000a      reassured PCTs that they were commissioning effective programmes; led to\u000d\u000a      PCTs adopting the National Obesity Observatory's Standard Evaluation\u000d\u000a      Framework (SEF) when making commissioning decisions. More specifically,\u000d\u000a      one PCT specified that the SEF and the University of Worcester's\u000d\u000a      evaluation tools and findings must be used by service providers.\u000d\u000a      The same PCT also used the evaluation and associated tools for their\u000d\u000a      revised NCMP service. Another PCT decided to pilot their own in-house\u000d\u000a      child weight management programme, incorporating best practice identified\u000d\u000a      through the evaluation; while another decided not to continue funding\u000d\u000a      their current programme which had been evaluated as part of this. Perhaps\u000d\u000a      the key overarching impact is that all West Midlands' PCTs accepted the\u000d\u000a      recommendation that they should continue to invest in child weight\u000d\u000a      management programmes.\u000d\u000a    The research relating to school-day variation in weight and height has\u000d\u000a      been fed into the practice of PCTs in data collection for the NCMP. Peters\u000d\u000a      contacted PCTs directly with the outcomes of the research and a number\u000d\u000a      responded to state that they would in future be recording whether\u000d\u000a      measurements were taken in the morning or the afternoon such that\u000d\u000a      school-day variation could be built into the outcome statistics (Source\u000d\u000a        E).\u000d\u000a    More generally, Peters' expertise led to him being invited to sit on the\u000d\u000a      Worcestershire Childhood Obesity Strategy Group in 2008-9 (Source F).\u000d\u000a      Within this Group, Peters held particular responsibilities for research,\u000d\u000a      specifically relating to childhood obesity intervention programmes which\u000d\u000a      are set out in the final version of the strategy and associated action\u000d\u000a      plan (Source G).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Childhood obesity is a national problem but it is a problem even more\u000d\u000a      keenly felt in the West Midlands where statistics show the percentage of\u000d\u000a      children classified as obese is higher than the national average.

A key\u000d\u000a      strand of this work has examined the efficacy of using simple\u000d\u000a      anthropometrical measures &#8212; such as waist circumference or Body Mass Index\u000d\u000a      (BMI) &#8212; as an indicator of obesity compared to criterion adipose tissue\u000d\u000a      values measured by expensive and time consuming MRI scans. The ability to\u000d\u000a      identify high risk obese children using simple and affordable surrogates\u000d\u000a      of central fat distribution is critical to healthcare providers tackling\u000d\u000a      the increasing prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents.\u000d\u000a    An international study pooled data from existing world studies (Peters\u000d\u000a      contributing approximately 20% of this data) where MRI assessment of\u000d\u000a      visceral adipose tissue and anthropometrical measures had been taken (Reference\u000d\u000a        1). Analysis indicated that waist circumference was the single best\u000d\u000a      predictor of visceral adipose tissue and BMI was the single best predictor\u000d\u000a      of subcutaneous adipose tissue. It was thus proposed that simple\u000d\u000a      anthropometrical assessments could be used as surrogate measures for the\u000d\u000a      identification of high risk obese children. Peters undertook further work\u000d\u000a      in collaboration with the University of Bristol to validate the use of\u000d\u000a      waist circumference across the full range of BMI. 179 12-13 year old\u000d\u000a      children underwent MRIs and anthropometric assessments confirming the\u000d\u000a      findings of the earlier international study (Reference 2). Further\u000d\u000a      research sought to determine the accuracy of dual-energy x-ray\u000d\u000a      absorptiometry (DXA) for the assessment of abdominal adipose tissue in\u000d\u000a      children (Reference 3). The study indicated a lack of precision at\u000d\u000a      the individual level for estimating abdominal fat levels and concluded\u000d\u000a      that in some situations, particularly at group monitoring level,\u000d\u000a      anthropometric measures would be the preferred assessment choice.\u000d\u000a    Peters brought this expertise to an evaluation study of child weight\u000d\u000a      management programmes funded by the Department of Health West Midlands (Grant\u000d\u000a        a) and undertaken with colleagues from Worcester's Psychological\u000d\u000a      Sciences Unit (Professor Dominic Upton 2006-present and Dr Penney Upton\u000d\u000a      2007-present) in 2009. At the time of the evaluation, seven family based\u000d\u000a      intervention programmes were in service across the West Midlands and four\u000d\u000a      of these had no published evidence of their effectiveness. The research\u000d\u000a      reported that none of the seven programmes routinely assessed all of the\u000d\u000a      essential evaluation measures highlighted by the National Obesity\u000d\u000a      Observatory's Standard Evaluation Framework. Analysis of waist\u000d\u000a      circumference and BMI indicated variable outcomes across the programmes\u000d\u000a      for short term effectiveness, and very few reported long term (&gt; 6\u000d\u000a      months) effectiveness (Reference 4).\u000d\u000a    Further research reflected upon the impact of the timing of measurement\u000d\u000a      within the school day on National Child Measurement Programme statistics (Reference\u000d\u000a        5).

A critical aspect of the development of\u000d\u000a      this body of work was the\u000d\u000a      adoption of a contextual approach to coach education that moved from\u000d\u000a      practice to theory and back\u000d\u000a      into practice (from football to psychology to football) through the\u000d\u000a      engagement undertaken with key\u000d\u000a      stakeholders and the research undertaken at Cumbria. For example, the\u000d\u000a      utility of reflective\u000d\u000a      practice, particularly through recognition by coaches that the perceptions\u000d\u000a      of others are often\u000d\u000a      framed round social cognitions (e.g. the attributions of a performer\u000d\u000a      following a performance\u000d\u000a      outcome). For many coaches, this is a unique experience and moves beyond\u000d\u000a      the more traditional\u000d\u000a      cognitive-behavioural approaches to coach-performer interventions, and\u000d\u000a      includes an emphasis on\u000d\u000a      the development and analysis of communication skills and practice\u000d\u000a      behaviours. The counter-cognitive\u000d\u000a      reasoning employed in this engagement is eminently recognisable in Miller\u000d\u000a      (2012) and\u000d\u000a      Miller and Cronin (2012), demonstrating the interplay between action\u000d\u000a      research engagement,\u000d\u000a      stakeholder publications and academic publication. Through the coaching\u000d\u000a      handbook, this approach\u000d\u000a      has been applied directly in the training of UK and European football\u000d\u000a      coaches throughout the\u000d\u000a      assessment period.\u000d\u000a    As a consequence of these research informed insights for practice, Dr\u000d\u000a      Houlston is a Psychology\u000d\u000a      Consultant to the Football Association, disseminating insights from the\u000d\u000a      sport psychology realm in a\u000d\u000a      direct manner, via the training of high-level coaches, as well as via\u000d\u000a      publications. In 2010, Dr\u000d\u000a      Houlston utilised the reflective practice studies by his colleague Telfer\u000d\u000a      in the design and delivery of\u000d\u000a      a new Coaching Psychology programme for FA\/UEFA Advanced Licence football\u000d\u000a      coaches, most\u000d\u000a      recently delivered in three sessions Spring to Summer 2013. Additionally,\u000d\u000a      Dr Houlston is also the\u000d\u000a      author of the FA's Level 2 Coaching Handbook (2009; 3rd\u000d\u000a      Edition) and wrote the `Coaching\u000d\u000a      Psychology' chapter for the new FA\/UEFA Level 4 Coaching Handbook (2012).\u000d\u000a      These directly\u000d\u000a      influence coach education and implementation of coaching techniques in\u000d\u000a      practice, as core texts for\u000d\u000a      the FA\/UEFA texts.\u000d\u000a    Within a wider coaching context, the research of Bampouras, Cronin and\u000d\u000a      Miller has introduced an\u000d\u000a      experiential dimension to the investigation of performance analysis in\u000d\u000a      sport via insights from Actor-Network\u000d\u000a      theory.

However, as engagement with practicing coaches increased, the\u000d\u000a      approach\u000d\u000a      increasingly moved from sport pedagogy aspects of coach education towards\u000d\u000a      examining the\u000d\u000a      cultural and historical perspectives of this practice, and into the\u000d\u000a      psychosocial elements of coaching\u000d\u000a      practice.

Whilst psychosocial concepts and theoretical\u000d\u000a      paradigms relevant to\u000d\u000a      coaching practice had been established for a considerable length of time\u000d\u000a      in areas such as mental\u000d\u000a      health psychology, they had not previously been applied within the field\u000d\u000a      of sport and coaching\u000d\u000a      studies. Through engagement with the action research of colleagues (Telfer\u000d\u000a      and Houlston), Dr\u000d\u000a      Paul Miller established a context to understand current theoretical models\u000d\u000a      and practice in\u000d\u000a      coaching, which was then used as a basis to further develop psychosocial\u000d\u000a      approaches, including\u000d\u000a      evaluation of discursive psychology in coaching and `reflexive practice',\u000d\u000a      to coach education\u000d\u000a      practice.

The study (conducted\u000d\u000a      by three members of\u000d\u000a      staff from the group: Bampouras, Cronin &amp; Miller, 2012) interviewed a\u000d\u000a      sport scientist, an\u000d\u000a      international coach and a former professional athlete who had extensive\u000d\u000a      experience in the use of\u000d\u000a      notational analysis. The research used actor-network theory (ANT) to\u000d\u000a      assess the results, and\u000d\u000a      indicated that, although the object and receiver of the notational\u000d\u000a      analysis process, the athlete is not\u000d\u000a      included within the process itself, with the coach acting as the\u000d\u000a      gatekeeper.\u000d\u000a    The key research insights from the work which have influenced its impact\u000d\u000a      on practice include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      That the discursive psychological perspective is naturally applicable\u000d\u000a        to coaching, given the\u000d\u000a        transparently task-focused character of many naturally-occurring verbal\u000d\u000a        activities in the\u000d\u000a        domain. (Whilst this has been applied to emotion and accounts of success\u000d\u000a        and failure in\u000d\u000a        sport, this had not previously been applied to coaching).\u000d\u000a      That this perspective can inform an approach to coaching interaction\u000d\u000a        that does not draw on\u000d\u000a        ontologically-problematic cognitivist assumptions regarding the\u000d\u000a        relationship between\u000d\u000a        thought and action.\u000d\u000a      That ethnomethodological research can further develop and refine\u000d\u000a        models of the action-context\u000d\u000a        relationship in coaching science.\u000d\u000a      That such an ethnomethodological perspective contradicts the current\u000d\u000a        dominant perception\u000d\u000a        of contexts in coaching activity as semi-static causal \"variables\".\u000d\u000a      This challenges the typical focus on capture of authentic individual\u000d\u000a        experience, and instead\u000d\u000a        concentrates on the coordinative accomplishment of meaningful action in\u000d\u000a        naturally-occurring\u000d\u000a        situations.\u000d\u000a      That a reflexive approach has implications as a theoretical approach\u000d\u000a        to coach education\u000d\u000a        and practice and in terms of coaching methodologies.\u000d\u000a      That excluding the performer from coaching practices such as\u000d\u000a        notational analysis can\u000d\u000a        impact on the effectiveness of coaching, particularly through negative\u000d\u000a        effects on motivation.\u000d\u000a      That consideration of the human factors influenced by technological\u000d\u000a        processes (such as\u000d\u000a        notational analysis) should be taken into account within coaching\u000d\u000a        practice.\u000d\u000a      That the \"availability heuristic\" (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1973)\u000d\u000a        should be considered for\u000d\u000a        practical state-of-play reasoning in largely observational sporting\u000d\u000a        activities such as\u000d\u000a        coaching, particularly in \"gatekeeping\" tasks around performance (such\u000d\u000a        as talent scouting,\u000d\u000a        team selection and substitution decisions by coaches), as well as\u000d\u000a        officiating in high-tempo\u000d\u000a        environments.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The research was conducted at University of Cumbria (and formerly at the\u000d\u000a      legacy institution St\u000d\u000a      Martin's College).

The uptake of the research by end users is\u000d\u000a      predominantly shown through these channels. The most recent article\u000d\u000a      (Esformes and Bampouras, November 2013), accepted for publication by the Journal\u000a        of Strength and Conditioning Research on 25th February\u000d\u000a      and available to view online ahead of print, features in the Journal's\u000d\u000a      most e-mailed articles (i.e. peer practitioner sharing through social\u000d\u000a      media), and has already been cited a number of times on fitness interest\u000d\u000a      websites (such as T Nation and CrossFit-APx). The Esformes et al (2010)\u000d\u000a      article is one of the journal's most popular, according to their Twitter\u000d\u000a      feed (which has over 10,000 followers, the majority of whom will be\u000d\u000a      athletes or coaches). The Journal of Strength and Conditioning\u000d\u000a        Research is a key route to reaching practitioners, as it\u000d\u000a      specifically targets practitioners as \"a unique aspect [of this journal]\u000d\u000a      is that it includes recommendations for the practical use of research\u000d\u000a      findings\". The Journal is affiliated to the National Strength and\u000d\u000a      Conditioning Association (30,000 members in 72 countries), whose aim is to\u000d\u000a      ``bridge the gap'' from the scientific laboratory to the field\u000d\u000a      practitioner. In addition, the Esformes et al (2010) paper is one of the\u000d\u000a      `Most recommended' papers in BioInfoBank Library, an open access, free\u000d\u000a      online resource promoting science.\u000d\u000a    Secondly, the research features on various athletic websites providing\u000d\u000a      advice to athletes. For example, the Australian Fitness Network (10,000\u000d\u000a      fitness instructors as members) utilised the Jones and Bampouras (2010)\u000d\u000a      paper to make assessment suggestions on leg strength assessment based on\u000d\u000a      the finding of this study. Similarly, the Center for Optimal Recovery, a\u000d\u000a      website designed for athletes and offering advice on training and avoiding\u000d\u000a      injury, has used the recent Esformes and Bampouras (2013) study to make\u000d\u000a      training suggestions. The research is also picked up in a number of other\u000d\u000a      blogs and websites around coaching and reflection on practice, indicating\u000d\u000a      that it stimulates debate around designing training programmes and\u000d\u000a      assessment of performance.\u000d\u000a    The articles on post-activation potentiation have created interest from\u000d\u000a      academics (e.g. Esformes et al, 2010 cited 15 times; Esformes et al, 2011\u000d\u000a      cited 4 times) as well as practitioners, due to the simple and applied\u000d\u000a      suggestions they make. As post-activation potentiation is a relatively new\u000d\u000a      area of research, much of the literature revolved around laboratory-based\u000d\u000a      conditions, with little transfer to the field. However, the articles on\u000d\u000a      post-activation potentiation have clear application to the athletes by\u000d\u000a      making suggestions on how to improve power performance acutely with\u000d\u000a      simple, low- resource exercises. An early indicator of the applicability\u000d\u000a      of this work in shaping training is through citation of research findings\u000d\u000a      by a company who design training aids, specifically Freq ReflexTM,\u000d\u000a      a product which the company are working directly with trainers.\u000d\u000a    In addition, Bampouras is an invited contributor to practitioner\u000d\u000a      education through delivery of sessions on Muscle and Tendon Conditioning\u000d\u000a      on the MSc Strength and Conditioning degree at the University of Bolton,\u000d\u000a      since the course began in 2008, the context of which is based on the\u000d\u000a      research insights. Further, Bampouras and other colleagues were invited by\u000d\u000a      Active Cumbria, an organisation dedicated to delivering Sport and Physical\u000d\u000a      Activity in Cumbria, to deliver workshops to coaches working with athletes\u000d\u000a      from different sports and of various performance levels. These workshops\u000d\u000a      for part of the organisation's Coaching Plus Development programme and the\u000d\u000a      workshops Bampouras delivered were on Periodisation and Introduction\u000a        to Strength and Conditioning. Evaluation from coaches attending\u000d\u000a      revealed that the most useful information was \"Practical ideas you can\u000d\u000a        incorporate into training really easily with minimum cost involved\";\u000d\u000a      \"Training info\"; \"How simple it can be\"; \"Assessment\u000a        bits\"; and \"Conditioning exercises\", suggesting that the\u000d\u000a      information provided was perceived as useful and easy to implement in\u000d\u000a      their practice.\u000d\u000a    Bampouras' work on muscle conditioning and assessment has informed\u000d\u000a      scientific support services provided to various athletes, with the prime\u000d\u000a      example being support provided to an athletics sprinter (U23 England\u000d\u000a      Championships finalist). Assessment of muscle function and subsequent\u000d\u000a      advice on training and improving performance was based on the research on\u000d\u000a      muscle imbalance assessment, power improvement and periodization.\u000d\u000a    Staff within the unit have also undertaken work with the Team GB diving\u000d\u000a      squad to assess and improve performance. This work was undertaken by\u000d\u000a      Nicola Relph and a former colleague from the unit, and provided mechanical\u000d\u000a      analysis of some of the most difficult dives, used to inform the focus of\u000d\u000a      training programmes. This resulted in improved performance for\u000d\u000a      synchronised divers in 2012 in relation to 2008 results. Relph and\u000d\u000a      Bampouras have co-authored papers on testing techniques (such as reference\u000d\u000a      2 in section 3), and the research followed the principles of the body of\u000d\u000a      work in relevant in situ testing for performance assessment.\u000d\u000a    Finally, research that has been undertaken on water polo training (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Bampouras and Marrin, 2009) has resulted in altering training and\u000d\u000a      assessment practices of the National Scottish Women's water polo team, in\u000d\u000a      light of the findings and suggestions of the body of work around the\u000d\u000a      sport. For example, the previously used 30 seconds cross bar jumps as a\u000d\u000a      measurement of lower leg power in water polo players, was abandoned due to\u000d\u000a      findings by Bampouras and Marrin (2010). Training loads and monitoring was\u000d\u000a      compared and designed around Marrin and Bampouras (2009) and Marrin and\u000d\u000a      Bampouras (2008), which informed the training process, assisted in player\u000d\u000a      selection as well as educated the players. The engagement with the team,\u000d\u000a      including both individual and team performance analysis, has contributed\u000d\u000a      to the promotion of the team to the top division.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The applied research generated has targeted practitioners and athletes at\u000d\u000a      all levels, and by combining expertise and knowledge from different areas\u000d\u000a      (primarily Biomechanics and Physiology), aimed to directly influence the\u000d\u000a      way in which muscle function is assessed in competitive sports. The\u000d\u000a      studies in the area of muscle conditioning and function has generated a\u000d\u000a      body of work that has the potential to be useful to coaches both in\u000d\u000a      competition as well as in training, but to date has not been fully\u000d\u000a      realised. By examining how the muscle responds to certain stimuli,\u000d\u000a      training suggestions have been provided that can acutely increase the\u000d\u000a      performance of an athlete, for example conditioning stimuli prior to\u000d\u000a      athletics performance (reference 4 in section 3). These suggestions can\u000d\u000a      assist both in improving the competitive performance as well as in\u000d\u000a      improving the quality of the content and experience of training sessions.\u000d\u000a    Further, evaluating a range of tests and assessment tools, such as by\u000d\u000a      examining their validity and reliability, monitoring and assessment\u000d\u000a      becomes much more accurate and sport-specific, enabling high-quality\u000d\u000a      training (such as in reference 2, section 3). In addition, as these\u000d\u000a      assessments allow testing to take place within the training and\u000d\u000a      performance environment the performer is accustomed to (such as in\u000d\u000a      reference 6, section 3), they also result in minimal disruption of the\u000d\u000a      training programme, which cannot be achieved using traditional assessment\u000d\u000a      techniques which require a visit to a laboratory for the assessment to\u000d\u000a      take place.\u000d\u000a    The range of applicability of the research to support uptake of the\u000d\u000a      recommendations and resultant training and performance benefits has been\u000d\u000a      maximised by ensuring the suggestions and equipment used are low cost and\u000d\u000a      easily accessible, enabling coaches and athletes from a wide range of\u000d\u000a      performance levels to utilise them, such as functional tests (such as in\u000d\u000a      reference 5, section 3). The work has highlighted that coaches and\u000d\u000a      athletes need to reassess their approaches to measuring performance and\u000d\u000a      specific measurement techniques used, and that doing so can improve\u000d\u000a      training techniques and athletic performance.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Cumbria\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cumbria (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Cumbria","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007842}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

Existing standard practice primarily focuses on\u000d\u000a      assessment of muscle function in a controlled laboratory environment, with\u000d\u000a      little transfer into sport-specific situations and contexts in which sport\u000d\u000a      practice (including competition) normally occur, such as water polo, team\u000d\u000a      games, running and functional activities. A gap was therefore identified;\u000d\u000a      however before this could be fully explored the assessment methods needed\u000d\u000a      to be evaluated and verified. Once these assessments had been evaluated,\u000d\u000a      further questions arose in that some of the assessments currently used\u000d\u000a      were not specific to the sport or environment and therefore lacked\u000d\u000a      reliability and validity.\u000d\u000a    Most of the research conducted is applied in nature, as it derives from\u000d\u000a      established and acknowledged gaps, identified through engagement with\u000d\u000a      coaches or through relevant literature. The practical need driving the\u000d\u000a      studies undertaken came from the lead researcher's own practice experience\u000d\u000a      as a UK national water polo coach, and was explored through research in\u000d\u000a      academic posts. The wider need for contextual performance analysis was\u000d\u000a      further identified through discussions with coaching and academic\u000d\u000a      colleagues from different disciplines: confirming widespread issues in\u000d\u000a      assessment and training to the ones faced in water polo. For example, with\u000d\u000a      Paul Jones, a Biomechanist working with UK Athletics, a need was\u000d\u000a      identified for more information on functional imbalance tests when\u000d\u000a      assessing athletes, leading to a study on functional tests (reference 4,\u000d\u000a      section 3). Similarly, with Joseph Esformes, a Strength and Conditioning\u000d\u000a      specialist working with athletes from various sports, we identified an\u000d\u000a      opportunity to enhance athletic training, which led to projects utilising\u000d\u000a      post-activation potentiation (references 3 and 4, section 3).\u000d\u000a    The studies outlined below, led by Theodoros Bampouras, give an overview\u000d\u000a      of the body of work and the collaborations with a number of key\u000d\u000a      colleagues, both internally and externally:\u000d\u000a    University of Cumbria:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Theodoros Bampouras, Senior Lecturer in Sport Mechanics and\u000d\u000a        Performance Analysis, 2007 onwards.\u000d\u000a      Nicola Relph, Teaching Research Assistant 2006 to 2010, Lecturer in\u000d\u000a        Biomechanics 2010 onwards.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    External colleagues in other HEIs:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Dr Joseph Esformes, Senior Lecturer in Sport and Exercise Physiology,\u000d\u000a        Cardiff Metropolitan University.\u000d\u000a      Dr Kelly Marrin, Senior Lecturer in Sport and Exercise Physiology,\u000d\u000a        Edge Hill University. &#8226; Dr Paul Jones, Lecturer in Sport Biomechanics\u000d\u000a        and Strength and Conditioning, University of Salford.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Key research projects:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Comparison of two water-polo, pool-based anaerobic tests to a\u000d\u000a        laboratory-based anaerobic power measurement to examine associations and\u000d\u000a        feasibility of comparisons of field-based assessment to laboratory-based\u000d\u000a        assessment (TB, KM, 2008-2010).\u000d\u000a      Examined different activities (bodyweight plyometric activities\u000d\u000a        versus heavy weights) and their effect on subsequent power performance,\u000d\u000a        to examine whether plyometrics can serve as a method of acute power\u000d\u000a        enhancement negating the need for equipment (JE, TB, 2009-2010).\u000d\u000a      Comparison of field-based, functional muscle imbalance tests to a\u000d\u000a        laboratory-based muscle imbalance test to examine associations and\u000d\u000a        feasibility of comparisons of field-based to laboratory-based assessment\u000d\u000a        and their utility (TB, KM, 2008-2010).\u000d\u000a      Examined different upper body muscle contractions (concentric,\u000d\u000a        eccentric, dynamic, isometric) and their effect on subsequent power\u000d\u000a        performance, to provide a method of acute power enhancement without the\u000d\u000a        need for equipment (JE, TB, 2009-2010).\u000d\u000a\u0009\u0009The research has given new\u000d\u000a        insights into how:\u000d\u000a      Muscle performance can be acutely improved or maintained following\u000d\u000a        initial contractions.

Findings led to recommendations regarding delivery, for\u000a      example appointing a project worker to liaise between the mental health\u000a      provider (AWP) and sport provision in the community (BCC). While BALP\u000a      began under the auspices of AWP, continuation, expansion and\u000a      sustainability depended on developing an effective link between mental\u000a      health services and community sport provision. Our recommendations led to\u000a      a full-time Physical Activity Development Officer for Mental Health being\u000a      appointed in 2009. This appointment and subsequent improved management and\u000a      delivery has seen sport and physical activity provision in Bristol for\u000a      people with mental health problems expand. Expansion is evidenced by\u000a      increasing attendance figures from 6150 in the 3 years from 2006-8 to 9183\u000a      in 2009-12 (49% increase in participation). Attendances have continued to\u000a      increase year on year through 2009-10 (2615 attendances), 2010-11 (3003)\u000a      and 2011-12 (3565). Additionally, by 2012 the number of activities offered\u000a      had increased to 30 [A] [D] [E].\u000a    The second impact concerns an impact on society through\u000a      increasing social inclusion of women in sport and physical activity. This\u000a      stems from our findings concerning a low proportion of women with mental\u000a      health problems accessing sport and physical activity and the\u000a      sociocultural factors involved. We recommended that other activity forms\u000a      should be incorporated within BALP to appeal to a wider range of women.\u000a      This led to the introduction from 2009 of new activities targeted towards\u000a      women including aerobics, African dance, martial arts, Tai Chi, yoga,\u000a      trampoline, and a women-only exercise group. While in 2008 only 30% of new\u000a      referrals to activity sessions were female, this figure had increased to\u000a      39% by 2010-2011. By 2012 the proportion of women had risen to 56% of\u000a      referrals [A] [D] [E].\u000a    The third impact concerns improved provision and access to health\u000a      and welfare services for people with mental health problems. Delivery\u000a      changes resulted from our identification of the specific difficulties some\u000a      people with mental health problems faced in becoming aware of, accessing\u000a      and sustaining participation in existing sport and physical activity\u000a      provision. BALP responded to these findings by (a) establishing an online\u000a      referral system and (b) establishing partnerships and referral pathways\u000a      through local support agencies. Together, these changes provide multiple\u000a      referral routes (including self-referral) that facilitate and support\u000a      access and involvement among a socially excluded section of the community.\u000a      By 2012, 18 partner agencies had made referrals. The BALP website has made\u000a      it possible not only to advertise and promote sessions but also to create\u000a      a publicly accessible point of entry. By 2010, 50% of referrals were\u000a      received online and by 2012 all referrals were online. By 2012 there had\u000a      been 7631 unique visits to the website indicating significant usage of the\u000a      website as both an information resource and a referral system which\u000a      partners and service users alike described as straightforward, practical\u000a      and efficient [A] [D] [E].\u000a    The fourth impact also concerns improved provision of health and\u000a      welfare services. Our published findings document and theorise the\u000a      benefits that service users experience through regular involvement in\u000a      sport and physical activity. These publications influenced practice within\u000a      AWP leading the Trust to begin hiring specialised sport coaches to deliver\u000a      sport opportunities in mental health contexts [D] [E]. Reference to the\u000a      publications helped stengthen applications for external funding [E]. These\u000a      funding applications (e.g., to the Football Foundation) have been\u000a      succesful over a 6-year period (2006-12) thereby supporting continued\u000a      provision of community physical activity and sport provision across\u000a      Bristol for people with mental health problems [A] [B].\u000a    The fifth impact concerns the development of resources to enhance\u000a      professional practice. In addition to 10 papers in international\u000a      peer-reviewed journals, we have sought to increase the impact of the\u000a      research on professional practice by publishing a first of its kind book\u000a      [C] which provides a practically oriented but state-of-the-art resource\u000a      for mental health professionals, exercise leaders, and sport coaches. The\u000a      book provides guidelines on effective provision of sport and physical\u000a      activity in mental heath contexts. The book was published internationally\u000a      (by respected publisher Wiley-Blackwell), increasing reach from local\u000a      (Bristol) to international.\u000a    The sixth impact concerns an influence on professional standards,\u000a      guidelines and training through delivering research-informed CPD. To date,\u000a      we have given 3 workshops for 45 mental health professionals, exercise\u000a      leaders, and sport coaches as an educational initiative to support the\u000a      development of skills in effective physical activity and sport delivery in\u000a      mental health settings [A] [D].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2000 we have conducted research and evaluations into sport and\u000a      physical activity provision for people with severe and enduring mental\u000a      health problems.

Focussing on the stories of\u000a      people with mental health problems has: (a) identified the ways physical\u000a      activity and sport can be experienced as beneficial [1,2,3]; (b) provided\u000a      new understanding of the meaning and value of physical activity and sport\u000a      in the context of individual service users' lives [6]; (c) generated\u000a      insights into what constitutes effective delivery, provision, and support\u000a      [4,5,6].\u000a    The findings identified 3 ways physical activity and sport can be\u000a      beneficial:\u000a    \u000a      For those individuals who previously held (or currently hold) an\u000a        athletic identity, re-engaging in physical activity or sport can\u000a        facilitate the reconstruction of a valued sense of self or identity that\u000a        has been lost or damaged through the experience of mental illness [1]\u000a      For others, adventure experiences through physical activity or sport\u000a        can stimulate the creation and sharing of new life stories around the\u000a        experience of action, achievement, and relationships [2]\u000a      For some, physical activity or sport can serve as a vehicle or\u000a        stepping stone for particular outcomes (e.g., improved fitness, weight\u000a        loss, social connectedness) which help individuals to - in one way or\u000a        another - move on in life [3]\u000a    \u000a    The findings also identified important practical, organisational and\u000a      delivery issues that affect both participation rates and outcomes:\u000a    - Low participation rates among women that could be increased through\u000a      targeted initiatives (such as dance and aerobics groups) [6]\u000a    - Difficulties with gaining information on activities, accessing groups,\u000a      and sustaining participation that require provision of specialised and\u000a      intensive social support [4]\u000a    - Community-building potential of activity groups which allow service\u000a      users to peer-support each other [4]\u000a    - The importance of the ethos and philosophy that underlies delivery\u000a      (i.e., how sessions are delivered) in supporting participation and\u000a      maximising personal benefits [5]\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21779","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    MoreLife is a spin out company of Leeds Metropolitan University providing\u000a      specialist and community weight management services across the UK and\u000a      internationally. There are three elements to the impact of MoreLife:\u000a      treatment, professional practice, and policy and public understanding [A].\u000a      These relate to improved health and welfare for participants, development\u000a      of training and resources to enhance professional practice and projected\u000a      economic benefits through effective treatment.\u000a    Treatment: We are now treating more than 3,500 adults and 3,000\u000a      young people per annum, making us the largest provider of such services in\u000a      the UK. The evidence provided by the underpinning research has facilitated\u000a      the growth in young people and adults treated as more NHS and other\u000a      contracts were secured by the University from 1999 and since February 2011\u000a      by MoreLife. Research demonstrating how MoreLife interventions decrease\u000a      cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk and enhance the quality of life\u000a      and enjoyment of those who attend their interventions has been important\u000a      in engaging new NHS and other major clients, as well as refining and\u000a      maintaining high quality services to existing clients. This underpins the\u000a      accreditation and recognition of our treatment services by the Department\u000a      of Health [B], the NHS [C] and government advisors [D]. Further evidence\u000a      of impact is associated with national awards [E] and recognition within\u000a      the NHS from PCTs and others that commissioned treatment and other\u000a      services [D,E,F], as well as from individuals and their families who have\u000a      received treatment [A].\u000a    MoreLife has delivered treatment services to more than 10,000 adults and\u000a      12,000 young people. Annual numbers of those treated have increased\u000a      significantly since the company has spun out, increasing our impact.\u000a      Service delivery models offered for young people and adults include [A]:\u000a    \u000a      Specialist &#8212; multidisciplinary services involving a range of\u000a        professionals (Hospital consultant, GP's, Dieticians, Clinical\u000a        Psychologists, physiotherapists and exercise specialists) delivered as\u000a        1:1 or group sessions.\u000a      Community &#8212; Face to face, group supports.\u000a      Self-care &#8212; Web based, virtual world, telephone, skype or text\u000a        support.\u000a    \u000a    The impact of MoreLife treatments on the lives of young people and adults\u000a      is multi-factorial and includes: significant improvement in weight\u000a      management through behaviour change applied to physical activity and\u000a      healthy eating, improvement in self-confidence, physical self-worth,\u000a      physical competence and physical fitness. There is also a clinically\u000a      significant decrease in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors\u000a      associated with obesity, such as body composition (BMI, waist\u000a      circumference, percentage body fat and fat mass), blood pressure, lipid\u000a      profiles, and psychological concerns such as worries about body shape and\u000a      size. Such impacts improve the physical, social and emotional health of\u000a      participants and contribute to a decrease in the current and future\u000a      economic resources required by the obese population.\u000a    Professional Practice: We are also commissioned by public sector\u000a      organisations to undertake reviews of their service provision for obesity.\u000a      We have employed our knowledge and expertise in delivery together with our\u000a      understanding of the evidence base to support local health commissioners\u000a      to establish best practice weight management systems [E,F,G], which has\u000a      been commended by the NHS [C]. We have developed and delivered specialist\u000a      and community weight management services to overweight and obese people in\u000a      more than 30 PCTs\/Local authorities since 2007 through &#163;18.5 million worth\u000a      of NHS and other contracts. Although they are based on a common set of\u000a      elements, our services are flexible and we tailor them to the needs\u000a      defined by the local context, which includes consideration of the\u000a      participants, the local services and staff that we work with, as well as\u000a      the specific requirements of the commissioners. This approach helps\u000a      achieve sustainable local service provision through improvements in local\u000a      standards of professional practice which increases legacy and long term\u000a      impact. Through our extensive training programmes we have significantly\u000a      improved the capability of over 1000 professionals involved in the\u000a      delivery of treatment services [A,B,C,E,F].\u000a    Policy and Public Understanding: MoreLife also has impact through\u000a      advisory roles, including informing policy. Gately is a spokesperson for\u000a      the Department of Health on obesity [G] and sits on the British Heart\u000a      Foundation Prevention and Care Committee. MoreLife contributed to the work\u000a      of The British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences on obesity and\u000a      advised on national guidelines for physical activity. Impact in the\u000a      private sector is exemplified by Gately's role in McDonald's 20% reduction\u000a      in calories in Happy Meals from 2012. International impact is exemplified\u000a      by a grant awarded with Imperial College, London and Qatar University for\u000a      a 5 year prospective study to assess the impact of MoreLife treatment\u000a      services in Qatari young people [H]. Our cross-sectional and longitudinal\u000a      research on area level deprivation and obesity challenged data provided\u000a      from the National Child Measurement Programme to the health ministry. We\u000a      showed that the relationship between obesity and deprivation is not linear\u000a      [6]. This has major implications for policy and targeting of resources.\u000a      The media impact of this research was extensive, reaching an audience of\u000a      23,461,698 (estimated by standard metrics [I]). Prof Gately and MoreLife\u000a      have significantly impacted the public understanding of obesity through\u000a      the media reach associated with their interventions. A selection of TV\u000a      shows includes: Old Before My Time, Nov 2013, BBC3; Tonight: The Unhealthy\u000a      Generation, September 2013, ITV1, 2.25m viewers; BBC Breakfast, August\u000a      2013, Oct 2013, BBC1, 1.5m viewers; Big Body Squad April 2013, Channel 5,\u000a      0.86m viewers; Too Fat to Toddle, 2008 ITV1, 3.89m viewers; The Duchess in\u000a      Hull, 2008, ITV1, 5.24m viewers.\u000a    Obesity is classified as an epidemic by the WHO, with over one billion\u000a      overweight adults worldwide and an estimated 22 million children under\u000a      five classified as obese. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease,\u000a      type 2 diabetes, stroke, some forms of cancer, arthritis and respiratory\u000a      disease and translates into healthcare costs of more than &#163;5 billion every\u000a      year in the UK. Overweight and obese children have measurable clinical\u000a      risk for type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases\u000a      that until recently were only associated with adulthood. The Call to\u000a      Action on Obesity (2011) recognised the need for greater investment in the\u000a      treatment of adult and childhood obesity, which aligns with the vision and\u000a      impact of MoreLife. The reach and significance of our work continues to\u000a      increase in the UK and internationally through interventions, professional\u000a      development, policy and public understanding in what is recognised as a\u000a      major public health issue.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our sustained impact in obesity treatment began in 1999 with Europe's\u000a      first residential camp programme for overweight and obese children.

Our research has\u000a      also showed that it is necessary to combine physical activity, healthy\u000a      eating, education and behaviour change with fun, enjoyment and development\u000a      of self-competence to achieve efficacious obesity treatment interventions\u000a      with young people. We have also provided evidence that changes in activity\u000a      and eating behaviours associated with our interventions produce clinically\u000a      significant reductions in measurements indicative of reduced\u000a      cardiovascular and metabolic disease [4,5]. For example, children on camp\u000a      programs between 1999 and 2002 were compared with overweight and obese\u000a      children of similar ages who were not camp attendees. Campers, who stayed\u000a      for a mean of 29 days, lost 6.0 kg, reduced their BMI by 2.4 units, and\u000a      reduced their BMI SD scores by 0.28. Fat mass decreased significantly\u000a      (from 42.7 to 37.1 kg), whereas fat-free mass did not change. In contrast,\u000a      both comparison groups gained weight during this period. Camp attendees\u000a      also showed significant improvements in blood pressure, aerobic fitness,\u000a      and self-esteem [4].\u000a    MoreLife is underpinned by research which began when Professor Paul\u000a      Gately (Chief Executive) undertook his PhD at Leeds Metropolitan\u000a      University, evaluating the experiences of over 1000 children who attended\u000a      a US weight loss camp between June 1994 and August 1997. His PhD was\u000a      supervised by Professor Cooke (Reader) and they have continued researching\u000a      obesity since that time. At the time of Professor Gately's PhD there was\u000a      no research evidence regarding the efficacy of weight loss camps in terms\u000a      of either acute effects or follow up data, which formed the basis of the\u000a      earliest publications using data from the US [1]. Based on this early\u000a      research evidence from the US, the first European residential camp was\u000a      established at Leeds Metropolitan University in 1999. From its inception\u000a      the camp programme and associated day camp and clubs programmes have\u000a      undergone rigorous evaluations to support refined delivery of\u000a      interventions based on evidence based practice [3,4,5].\u000a    Our early research focussed on establishing the efficacy of a weight loss\u000a      camp combining diet, physical activity, education and behaviour change, as\u000a      a mode of treatment for overweight and obese children (acute responses and\u000a      longer term follow up) (Gately (lecturer, professor 2004) and Cooke\u000a      (reader, professor 1998) [2]). As the camp programme became established\u000a      through evidenced based practice, other more specific research was\u000a      undertaken. This included validation of body composition assessment in\u000a      overweight and obese children (which led to a PhD for Radley supervised by\u000a      Cooke and Gately and subsequent employment as a Research Fellow, left\u000a      Leeds Met 2008), funded by the National Heart Research Fund (NHRF 3) [3].\u000a      Dietary randomised controlled trials (which led to a PhD by Duckworth, now\u000a      staff, supervised by Gately (professor) and King (professor)) were funded\u000a      by Glaxo Smith Kline. Clinically significant health risk factors were also\u000a      shown to improve with our interventions, such as lipid profiles and\u000a      sub-fractions (PhD by Hobkirk, employed at another university 2011, also\u000a      supervised by King and Gately) [5].\u000a    Recent research has challenged established mainstream views, including\u000a      those of the health ministry that paediatric obesity increases linearly\u000a      with deprivation [6] (Griffiths, PhD bursary student supervised by Cooke\u000a      and Gately, staff 2008). There are 35 peer reviewed journal articles and\u000a      over 350 national and international conference presentations underpinning\u000a      the impact of MoreLife on the effective treatment of obesity.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21780","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3585968","Name":"El Salvador"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3489940","Name":"Jamaica"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our distinctive perspectives on promoting lifestyle change allow us to\u000d\u000a      design bespoke approaches that enhance Public Health and personal\u000d\u000a      development through sport.

Item #116 of the\u000d\u000a      Corporate Performance Assessment Derby, 2009, conducted by the independent\u000d\u000a      Audit Commission [B] explained that `The Council's `b active' project\u000d\u000a        which aims to increase the number of people of all ages taking part in\u000d\u000a        physical activity, has organised much of the improvements. A reason for\u000d\u000a        its success is the use of research methods delivered by a team from\u000d\u000a        Leeds Metropolitan University'. Item #119 links to our commitment to\u000d\u000a      making research outcomes accessible and relevant; `Information on `b\u000d\u000a        active' and other physical activity programmes is easily accessible.

In 2013 this led to us\u000d\u000a      collaborating in successfully bidding to deliver a new 3-year &#163;1m\u000d\u000a      NHS-funded health promotion service.

Overall, this 9-year span\u000d\u000a      (2007-2016), facilitated by McKenna, represents a prolonged period\u000d\u000a      of positively influencing a local authority serving a city of almost\u000d\u000a      250,000 people, to address high levels of inactivity-related ill-health.\u000d\u000a    More recently we worked with the bidders to develop a persuasive and\u000d\u000a      integrated delivery and evaluation approach for the Leeds Let's Get Active\u000d\u000a      programme (2012-14; Sport England funded; McKenna). This targets\u000d\u000a      under-served communities with little engagement in either sport or PA.

PLH underlines the potency of our approach to evaluation\u000d\u000a      while also providing important `proof of concept'; with annual attendances\u000d\u000a      exceeding 12 million this shows immense Public Health potential.

We have\u000d\u000a      confirmed that programmes &#8212; whether to increase physical activity or to\u000d\u000a      promote sport-for-development &#8212; can be more effective after careful\u000d\u000a      consideration of how the intervention produces intended outcomes.\u000d\u000a    Work examining and promoting physical activity began in the early 1990s (Cooke\u000d\u000a      and Gately) with the Carnegie International Weight Loss programme\u000d\u000a      (CIWL; British Heart Foundation funded). This was expanded to concurrently\u000d\u000a      evaluate 10 UK-wide community interventions aimed at promoting physical\u000d\u000a      activity (Local Exercise Action Pilots (LEAP), 2004-2008; DoH funded; Cooke\u000d\u000a      and Pringle [3]). Beyond this, the 3-year Old People's Active\u000d\u000a      Living study (2007-2009; MRC funded) and the 3-year health literacy study\u000d\u000a      of physical activity and diet among women with low health literacy\u000d\u000a      (SWITCH; 2008-2010, NIHR funded; McKenna) show prolonged\u000d\u000a      engagement with communities with low activity profiles [2-5]. A number of\u000d\u000a      local evaluations have influenced policy and provision across cities,\u000d\u000a      e.g., Derby (McKenna and Long) and Nottingham (Pringle).\u000d\u000a      Each was based on contemporary conceptual frameworks that refine\u000d\u000a      understanding about measurement of change while evaluating programme\u000d\u000a      impact (e.g., RE-AIM). Our Premier League Health evaluation confirmed that\u000d\u000a      an innovative amalgam of high profile professional football clubs can be\u000d\u000a      developed to powerfully and successfully promote physical activity to\u000d\u000a      hard-to-engage men [4,5]. This is through the reach of these clubs into\u000d\u000a      groups who only rarely access NHS provision.\u000d\u000a    In sport-for-development basic critical evaluations conducted for the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Executive, Sport England\/UK Sport and UNICEF led to a prolonged\u000d\u000a      array of international work, including that delivered in Nairobi, Harare,\u000d\u000a      Lusaka and Mumbai [1]. Commissions from Comic Relief and UK Sport have\u000d\u000a      assessed the contribution that sport might make to addressing the social\u000d\u000a      concerns linked to gang violence and support for children with HIV\/Aids.\u000d\u000a      Based on over &#163;200K of independent funding (Coalter), this approach\u000d\u000a      has changed the perspective of practitioners and funders, so they are now\u000d\u000a      more likely to formulate theories of change (particularly around\u000d\u000a      self-efficacy) that inform programme design, monitoring and evaluation.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21781","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Racism is a major societal and cultural issue, and over the last twenty\u000a      years sport has had a high profile within public debates about racism and\u000a      the development of effective antiracist strategies.\u000a    Our body of research over this time has impacted incrementally upon these\u000a      processes through the development of professional equality standards,\u000a      guidelines and policies and CPD; enhanced public understandings of race\u000a      and the multiple forms of racism; and the stimulation of debate to shape\u000a      policy and improve opportunities.\u000a    The first impact is on the development of professional equality\u000a      standards, guidelines and policies and CPD. As a sensitive political\u000a      issue, studying racism raises complex implications for research practice\u000a      and the dissemination of findings in order to have impact. An important\u000a      part of our research has been to establish long term relationships with\u000a      individuals based in a wide range of organisations and networks, locally\u000a      and nationally in order to maximise impact. For example, researchers Long\u000a      and Spracklen have been members on national equity\/diversity panels\u000a      responsible for developing and implementing equality standards in sport\u000a      [A], and others have moved into roles within the university from positions\u000a      within local anti-racist organisations and networks (Spracklen from Sporting\u000a        Equals; Hylton, a former member of the Black sports forum (BEMSport)\u000a      in Yorkshire, and his research on BME participation underpinned the\u000a      development of SportsWeb in Bradford).\u000a    The second impact has been to make significant contributions to\u000a      national agendas and emerging policy initiatives around racism. Our\u000a      initial research for the RFL and the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE)\u000a      laid the foundations for the Tackle It campaign in the mid 1990s\u000a      [B] (the first anti-racist campaign by a national governing body of sport)\u000a      and, reflecting our sustained research relationships, its subsequent\u000a      re-launch in 2010. Long has been a member of the national Accreditation\u000a      Panel for the Racial Equality Standard for Professional Football Clubs,\u000a      established by Kick it Out, and drew on research from the Centre\u000a      for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion on the intersection of race with\u000a      gender, sexuality, and disability in its subsequent development into the\u000a      now generic Equality Standard in 2009 [C]. Spracklen has played a\u000a      similar role as a verifier for the Equality Standard for Sport [http:\/\/www.equalitystandard.org\/].\u000a      Although some time after our 2000 report on racism in football, the\u000a      English Footballing authorities have included some of our recommendations\u000a      in their 2012 `Inclusion and Anti-Discrimination Action Plan' [D] .\u000a      Flintoff was invited to present her research on BME students' experience\u000a      of PETE in two national CPD events aimed at teachers and teacher educators\u000a      in 2009: the annual conference of the national network of teacher\u000a      trainers, and the Association for Physical Education, Equity conference;\u000a      the report was also included on `Multiverse', a Professional Resource\u000a      Network, funded by the TDA, to support teachers to raise the achievement\u000a      of students from diverse backgrounds [E]. Our close relationships with\u000a      high profile practitioners and policy makers, and the high regard in which\u000a      our research on racism is held by those outside academia is evidenced by\u000a      Lord Herman Ouseley's involvement as one of the keynote speakers at our\u000a      2005 national conference on Sport and Anti-Racism in the 21stCentury,\u000a      and in his written introduction to Long and Spracklen's (2010) book, Sport\u000a        and Challenges to Racism. More recently, our collective expertise\u000a      and reputation in the field led to our being commissioned to produce the\u000a      systematic review of participation by BME communities in sport and\u000a      physical recreation in 2009, providing an important evidence base for\u000a      underpinning the work of Sporting Equals and the UK Sports Councils to\u000a      increase ethnic diversity in sport [F].\u000a    Our third impact is on enhancing public understandings of race and\u000a      racism, nationally and internationally, including through media coverage.\u000a      Hylton's book on `Race' and Sport: Critical Race Theory, was\u000a      named as one of the top ten resources for thinking critically about\u000a      the role of sport in society, including a teachable summary of the book in\u000a      an innovative on-line North American based collection, The Social\u000a        Issues Collection by Routledge [www.socialissuescollection.com]; he\u000a      has had various media interviews and high profile keynote engagements as a\u000a      result of his work [G], and was invited to compile a special collection on\u000a      Race, Ethnicity and Sport of electronically\/web-based materials deemed\u000a      significant for researching race, ethnicity and sport, for the British\u000a      Library [H].

A key finding identified that support\u000a      for racial equality varied within and between organisations, with denial\u000a      of the existence of racism by key stakeholders an important barrier to the\u000a      development and implementation of effective anti-racist practice. Hylton's\u000a      (2003) PhD research and subsequent book [2] focused specifically on\u000a      exploring these processes in local government's (dis) engagement with\u000a      racial equality, the first study worldwide to draw on Critical Race Theory\u000a      (CRT) in its analysis of sport policy and practice. These studies informed\u000a      the development of a number of national equality campaigns and standards\u000a      in sport, such as Kick it Out's Equality Standard for Sport.\u000a    In the late 1990s early 2000s we led a series of studies focusing on\u000a      participation and sport and leisure experiences of black and minority\u000a      ethnic (BME) groups. Carrington's research [3] explores sport's role in\u000a      the way race and racism are perpetuated, and its place within black\u000a      diasporic struggles and in relation to the politics of recognition within\u000a      contemporary multicultural societies. Hylton's research (senior lecturer,\u000a      now Professor) on BME participation in sport in Bradford, underpinned the\u000a      development of SportsWeb, an advocacy network aimed at increasing\u000a      ethnic diversity and well being.\u000a    Two local studies [4] by Scraton (Professor, now Emeritus Professor)\u000a      extended our earlier focus on men's sport, by centring black and South\u000a      Asian women's experiences of physical activity programmes. The Zindagi\u000a      research in 2000, conducted for Kirklees Council, revealed the complex\u000a      interrelationship of race, gender and class in South Asian women's\u000a      experiences of a physical activity intervention programme. A later study\u000a      (with Holland, Research Assistant, now Research Fellow) mapped the\u000a      under-representation and experiences of BME women footballers in Yorkshire\u000a      and Humberside; recent work by Ratna (senior lecturer), Stride (PhD\u000a      student, now senior lecturer) and Watson (principal lecturer) has\u000a      continued this intersectional analysis.\u000a    In 2007\/8, Flintoff (Professor) extended the focus on sport to physical\u000a      education and led the first national study [5] of BME students'\u000a      experiences of PE teacher education revealing training contexts\u000a      characterised by racial and gender stereotyping and `colour blind'\u000a      practice. In 2008, Sporting Equals and the UK Sports Councils\u000a      commissioned us to conduct a systematic review of participation by BME\u000a      communities in sport and recreation [6] in recognition of the strength of\u000a      our expertise and research in this field.\u000a    Our research has demonstrated that although there may be a growing\u000a      participation of BME communities, sporting bodies and related\u000a      organisations remain characterised by an overwhelming whiteness.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21784","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research has transformed UK and international thinking, policy and\u000a      practice in the areas identified above:\u000a    Sport coaching as a blended professional area: We have led the\u000a      international sport coaching policy community, including leadership\u000a      positions in the International Council for Coaching Excellence (ICCE) and\u000a      the European Coaching Council (ECC).

This segmentation\/modelling\u000a      approach assists governing bodies of sport to review and reorganise their\u000a      sport coaching systems. For example, British Gymnastics has based its\u000a      Sport England funding submission, Participation `Gymnastics for All'\u000a        Strategy, and revised coaching structures on segmentation work\u000a      developed at Leeds Metropolitan University [G].\u000a    Sport coaching workforce development, education and qualifications:\u000a      Our research has underpinned coach development systems thinking in the UK\u000a      (the Coach Development Model) [H]. In particular, this research work has\u000a      helped to define the children and performer development coaching roles and\u000a      the Level 4 expertise associated with these roles [4]. The national lead\u000a      agency for coaching, Sports Coach UK, has based its Level 4 provision on\u000a      this work, and Level 4 programmes have been developed in basketball,\u000a      cricket, hockey, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, squash, and table\u000a      tennis, with development work currently taking place in canoeing,\u000a      equestrian sport, and judo.\u000a    The mechanisms of sport coach development and education: Our\u000a      research on coach development has led to professional development\u000a      programmes for the Football Association's Youth Coach Educators and High\u000a      Performing Coaches Academy [I]. Similar programmes have been put in place\u000a      for UK Sport and the Royal Yachting Association. We have also undertaken\u000a      research work to examine and inform the Football Association's player\u000a      development pathway. Research work in gymnastics and rugby league has led\u000a      to a redesign of their United Kingdom Coaching Certificate (UKCC) Levels\u000a      1-3. We have undertaken ground breaking and highly regarded 1:1 coach\u000a      development work using audio-video capture and a reflective framework in\u000a      hockey, rugby league and sailing.\u000a    Coaching in context: Our research work on women and girl's,\u000a      disability, and black and minority ethnic sport has led directly to a\u000a      number of coach development resources utilised by Sports Coach UK and the\u000a      Women's Sport Foundation [J]. These are now being accessed through Sports\u000a      Coach UK workshops and resources by thousands of practising coaches.\u000a    Overall\u000a    \u000a       Our central and very visible place in the UK and international sport\u000a        coaching policy environment and our very active research programme\u000a        situate us as very strong contenders for the world's leading university\u000a        in sport coaching policy, practice and development.\u000a       We estimate our research ideas, tools and resources have had a policy\u000a        and practice impact in over 30 countries, and directly on the work of at\u000a        least 26 international agencies and sporting bodies.

Our work has conceptualised\u000a      sport coaching as a blended professional area and created a conceptual\u000a      basis for policy development. Situated within a broader agenda of\u000a      professionalising practice, this approach recognises the extant structural\u000a      and resource conditions impacting on and influencing change in sport\u000a      coaching. This is with particular reference to the extensive and valued\u000a      contribution of community volunteers in addition to that of the more\u000a      visible full-time paid high-performance coach [2].\u000a    Sport coaching as a segmented workforce: Historically, sport\u000a      coaching has been treated as homogeneous or synonymous with\u000a      high-performance coaching. Our research has critically challenged and\u000a      redefined sport coaching as a segmented workforce with four main roles\u000a      identified - children's coaches, adult recreational coaches, performance\u000a      development coaches, and high performance coaches &#8212; closely aligned to the\u000a      specific wants and needs of identified participant and performer groups\u000a      [3]. Further, this segmentation has been augmented by work on expertise\u000a      development and existing staged educational approaches, which has led to\u000a      the development of the internationally recognised 4x4 Coach Development\u000a      Model [3].\u000a    Sport coaching workforce development, education and qualifications:\u000a      Our research has examined the implications of a blended and segmented\u000a      workforce for coach development, education and qualifications. Thus, we\u000a      have produced cutting edge role definitions, curricula and development\u000a      methodologies; for example, for children's coaches and performance\u000a      development coaches. Particular attention has been given to the higher\u000a      levels of the development and qualifications continuum (known as Level 4)\u000a      [4]. This work has established the roles, attributes, capabilities and\u000a      professional competences of coaches, broadly aligned at a post-graduate\u000a      level, which has provided the basis for recent qualification submissions.\u000a    The mechanisms of sport coach development and education: We have\u000a      established mechanisms and tools to facilitate coach development and\u000a      education. Our work has conceptualised coaching practice as a\u000a      multi-layered relational phenomenon [5] which focuses attention on the\u000a      cognitive, behavioural and social dimensions of practice, and with it a\u000a      range of learning philosophies and developmental approaches. Aligned with\u000a      this, our research has provided thinking tools for coach developers and\u000a      coaches to reflect on the knowledge bases, problem solving and decision\u000a      making repertoires used within complex, dynamic and politicised coaching\u000a      environments [1].\u000a    Sport coaching in context: Our research has developed an\u000a      understanding of, and given a voice to, the contexts, conditions and\u000a      constraints of less well represented coaching populations within the\u000a      professionalisation agenda, and the implications for coach development and\u000a      education. This includes studies on unpaid and community coaches, women\u000a      coaches, coaches of women and girls, and coaches of disabled athletes [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21786","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our research has influenced global anti-doping policy and practice since\u000d\u000a      2007.

For example, she successfully advocated that UKA altered\u000d\u000a        their strategy to\u000d\u000a        target the wider athletics community. UKA's Anti-Doping Manager stated\u000d\u000a        that Backhouse's\u000d\u000a        \"education knowledge has been invaluable to the development of this\u000d\u000a          strategy which aims\u000d\u000a          to provide appropriate and effective anti-doping education for all\u000d\u000a          sections of the athletics\u000d\u000a          community in the UK\".

Backhouse has delivered workshops for\u000d\u000a        organisations such\u000d\u000a        as UKAD and Sports Medicine Australia to challenge and shape their\u000d\u000a        anti-doping strategy.\u000d\u000a      A further impact of our research relates to the influence that the\u000d\u000a        findings have had on global\u000d\u000a        debates on public policy and practice. In response to our\u000d\u000a        reports, the WADA has altered\u000d\u000a        the anti-doping landscape of the global sports community.

The WADA's\u000d\u000a        Director of Education stated that our 2007 and 2009 reports provided to\u000d\u000a        the WADA have\u000d\u000a        \"proven to be key elements in the area of anti-doping social science\u000d\u000a          research.

As a\u000d\u000a        result, the WADA has created a Researcher Directory (www.wada-ama.org\/en\/Education-\u000d\u000a          Awareness\/Social-Science\/Researchers-Directory\/) to develop a\u000d\u000a        network of key\u000d\u000a        stakeholders and to increase visibility and awareness of social science\u000d\u000a        research.\u000d\u000a      The seventh main point of impact concerns health and welfare impacts\u000d\u000a        through the\u000d\u000a        influence on continuous professional development of practitioners\u000d\u000a            and researchers.\u000d\u000a        The initial research linked national and international beneficiaries\u000d\u000a        through collaborative\u000d\u000a        projects. These links have supported the professional development of two\u000d\u000a        research\u000d\u000a        assistants (Atkins and Patterson) who were involved in the WADA funded\u000d\u000a        projects. In\u000d\u000a        addition, the research team have secured internal funding for three\u000d\u000a        full-time PhD bursaries\u000d\u000a        (Director of Studies, Backhouse). External funding from the Rugby\u000d\u000a        Football Union (see\u000d\u000a        section 3) is supporting the first graduate of this programme (Whitaker)\u000d\u000a        to pursue post-doctoral\u000d\u000a        research in the field. Our commitment to addressing the gaps in the\u000d\u000a        literature, and\u000d\u000a        extending the research agenda, has given rise to a critical mass of\u000d\u000a        researchers focused on\u000d\u000a        doping and anti-doping in sport. For example, Whitaker's PhD thesis\u000d\u000a        marked a significant\u000d\u000a        step in identifying the risk and protective factors of doping in sport\u000d\u000a        through the novel\u000d\u000a        application of the Prototype Willingness model.\u000d\u000a      Since the impact of our work is global and expressed through\u000d\u000a        world-wide education\u000d\u000a        programmes implemented by the WADA, our work provides direct benefit\u000d\u000a          to the health\u000d\u000a          and quality of life of sports performers. Engagement with\u000d\u000a        education programmes founded\u000d\u000a        on our research, improves the awareness, understanding, and attitude of\u000d\u000a        sports\u000d\u000a        performers. In turn, this contributes to a reduced risk of potential\u000d\u000a        harm associated with\u000d\u000a        reducing and preventing doping in sport. In the UK, our impact is\u000d\u000a        demonstrated by the\u000d\u000a        7000+ athletes and their support personnel who have received anti-doping\u000d\u000a        education from\u000d\u000a        UKAD since 2011.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    We have substantially redirected anti-doping in sport by informing global\u000d\u000a      education policy and\u000d\u000a      practice at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the European Commission,\u000d\u000a      UK Anti-Doping\u000d\u000a      (UKAD) and UK Athletics (UKA).

Consequently, the WADA\u000d\u000a      released a call to\u000d\u000a      undertake a systematic review of literature regarding contemporary\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards doping in\u000d\u000a      sport and anti-doping education. Our Leeds Metropolitan research team of\u000d\u000a      Backhouse (PI: Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer 2005; Reader 2008), McKenna (Professor) and Robinson (Professor)\u000d\u000a      responded to this\u000d\u000a      competitive call and were successful in securing funding to undertake the\u000d\u000a      review. The WADA's\u000d\u000a      repeated investment in our research team over nine years (see section 3)\u000d\u000a      demonstrates their\u000d\u000a      confidence in the quality of our research and highlights the impact and\u000d\u000a      influence that our research\u000d\u000a      has on the global anti-doping community.\u000d\u000a    The first review [1] encompassed an extensive annotated bibliography of\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a      publications regarding: (i) predictors and precipitating factors in\u000d\u000a      doping, (ii) attitudes and\u000d\u000a      behaviours towards doping and, (iii) anti-doping education or prevention\u000d\u000a      programmes. The findings\u000d\u000a      of this review demonstrate that any attempt to make anti-doping\u000d\u000a      evidence-based was problematic\u000d\u000a      because the evidence base is weak [1, 3]. This undermines strategic\u000d\u000a      planning and limits our ability\u000d\u000a      to target appropriate and efficacious education programmes. The findings\u000d\u000a      also suggest there is an\u000d\u000a      urgent need to advance understanding of the psychosocial determinants of\u000d\u000a      doping behaviour,\u000d\u000a      especially through collaborative research efforts at a global level.\u000d\u000a    The recommendations of this first review have been considered and\u000d\u000a      addressed through empirical\u000d\u000a      research currently being undertaken worldwide [6]. Our research\u000d\u000a      collaborations with colleagues in\u000d\u000a      Australia, the US, the UK, and Hungary are helping to build on the\u000d\u000a      recommendations of the first\u000d\u000a      review in order to advance understanding of doping behaviours (see section\u000d\u000a      3 on the collaborative\u000d\u000a      grants obtained). Further, the findings of this review have guided the\u000d\u000a      doctoral programmes of three\u000d\u000a      Carnegie bursary funded students (Whitaker, Patterson and Erickson;\u000d\u000a      Backhouse is Director of\u000d\u000a      Studies) [4].\u000d\u000a    In 2008, Backhouse and McKenna were re-commissioned by the WADA to\u000d\u000a      evaluate the efficacy of\u000d\u000a      prevention approaches across four related, yet independent, social\u000d\u000a      domains. These domains were\u000d\u000a      the prevention of tobacco use, alcohol use, social drug use and bullying\u000d\u000a      (Patterson was the\u000d\u000a      Research Assistant on the project). The objective of this review was to\u000d\u000a      inform global anti-doping\u000d\u000a      education and policy by identifying the most potent factors of successful\u000d\u000a      domain-specific\u000d\u000a      prevention programmes. The findings [2, 5] suggested that the most\u000d\u000a      effective interventions are: (i)\u000d\u000a      targeted at young people and adolescents when attitudes and values are\u000d\u000a      forming, (ii) tailored to fit\u000d\u000a      the target population, (iii) interactive and active, (iv) derived from\u000d\u000a      social influence approaches, (v)\u000d\u000a      focused on developing core life skills, (vi) delivered by well-trained\u000d\u000a      individuals, and (vii) based on\u000d\u000a      booster sessions delivered over a number of years.

Provided consultancy on effective physical activity promotion in the\u000a      EU in both Spain (Regional Government Department of Sport and Physical\u000a      activity in Castilla-La Mancha) (2012) (Corroborating source A)\u000a      and in the Czech Republic (2010).\u000a    ii. Worked with the British Heart Foundation National Centre for Physical\u000a      Activity and Health in the development of the Exercise Referral Toolkit\u000a      (see - http:\/\/www.bhfactive.org.uk\/sites\/Exercise-Referral-Toolkit\/index.html)\u000a      published in 2011 (Corroborating source B).\u000a    iii. Member of a cross-sector working group of clinical, commercial and\u000a      third\/sector-public organisations who developed the `Active Planning\u000a      Toolkit' (see - http:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/media\/sharedlearning\/326_nhsglos_nhs_uk.pdf)\u000a      to facilitate implementation of the Centre for Public Health Excellence\u000a      (NICE) \"Promoting or Creating Built or Natural Environments that Encourage\u000a      and Support Physical Activity\" (2008) guidelines. The toolkit is\u000a      recognised by NICE as having a significant impact to the work in this area\u000a      going forward (Corroborating source C).\u000a    iv. Presented at national conferences on physical activity pathways in\u000a      2010 (62 health professionals attended) (Corroborating source B)\u000a      and regional public health conferences for art on referral in 2012 (South\u000a      West) and 2013 (Milton Keynes) (Corroborating source D).\u000a    v. Part of a group to develop a `Commissioning Resource for Physical\u000a      Activity, Mental Health and Wellbeing and Food and Nutrition for the North\u000a      West of England' (see - http:\/\/www.nwcommissioning.org\/planning-for-commissioning\/commissioning-for-\u000a        wellness\/),\u000a      for NHS North West, 2010-2011.\u000a    vi. Adoption of the evaluation processes and documentation developed by\u000a      Crone in the Art Lift, Gloucestershire project by the Bristol Art Shine\u000a      referral programme (Corroborating source D).\u000a    vii. Testimonies from public health and clinical professionals on the\u000a      impact of research on subsequent commissioning decisions in the area of\u000a      art and physical activity referral interventions (Corroborating sources D,\u000a      E, F, G).\u000a    b. Impact on professional development\u000a      The research has influenced the professional development of exercise\u000a      instructors across the UK and health professionals (doctors, nurses,\u000a      public health practitioners) across the UK and EU. \u000a    This is evidenced by the following:\u000a    i. Authored chapter and related course tutor slides and notes in the\u000a      British Association for Cardiac and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (BACPR)\u000a      exercise instructor manual; the resource for exercise instructors on the\u000a      national BACPR Phase IV exercise instructor course. Nine regions use the\u000a      manual, including Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, with approximately\u000a      250 instructors being trained per year (Corroborating sources B, H).\u000a    ii. Content for the In2Health's UK wide professional development\u000a      programme for clinicians (1200 clinicians attended per annum) includes the\u000a      research (Corroborating source I).\u000a    iii. Professor Crone was the lead for the EU Leonardo Funded Healthy\u000a      Europe through Learning and Practice (HELP) project (see - http:\/\/www.help-project.com\/3\/2\/WHAT-IS-\u000a        HELP?lingua=en)\u000a      which has developed an online CPD resource for health professionals across\u000a      6 EU countries. Initial impact from the needs analysis and piloting of the\u000a      resource identifies that over 300 EU based health professionals have been\u000a      involved in its development and piloting. Longer term impact will be known\u000a      after the product is launched November 2013 (Corroborating source A,\u000a      I).\u000a    iv. A central part of many of the commissioned evaluations has involved a\u000a      training element for staff involved in the delivery of these interventions\u000a      such as physical activity and health referral professionals.\u000a    v. Crone is co-author of text book; Physical Activity and Health\u000a      Promotion: Evidenced- based Approaches to Practice (2009).\u000a    c. Impact on patient benefit\u000a    The research has impacted on patients through improving practice and\u000a    striving for evidenced based practice in primary care.\u000a    This is evidenced by the following:\u000a    i. The applied interventions that underpin this case study have involved\u000a      over 6000 patients, thereby having a direct impact on these individuals\u000a      and their families within the community.\u000a    ii. Many of the commissioned evaluation research projects have included\u000a      the design of interventions enabling an evidenced based approach to\u000a      intervention design. The aim is to improve the effectiveness of such\u000a      interventions and thus improve individual patient uptake, attendance and\u000a      completion, leading to improved health outcomes (Corroborating sources B,\u000a      D, H, G).\u000a    iii. The BACPR course, taken by approximately 240 fitness instructors per\u000a      annum, each required to read the chapters contributed by Crone\u000a      (Corroborating source H). These instructors teach approximately\u000a      2-3 classes a week with approximately 20-30 patients in each class.\u000a      Crone's chapter and tutor resource on psychological considerations for\u000a      cardiac patients will inform their practice daily. The impact on patients\u000a      is therefore estimated at 6000-9000 per annum in the UK (Corroborating\u000a      source B).\u000a    iv. Crone's input into the content of three toolkits (two national, one\u000a      regional - exercise referral, use of the built environment for physical\u000a      activity and a commissioning resource) will have an impact on patients via\u000a      the evidence based interventions informed by these documents\u000a      (Corroborating source C).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken by Professor Diane Crone, Professor David James\u000a      and co-researchers has investigated the use of physical activity and art\u000a      promotion interventions in health care, as an adjunct to treatment, to\u000a      improve patient health and wellbeing.

The specific areas of focus are physical activity\/exercise referral,\u000a      and art referral. The research is summarized below.\u000a    Physical activity referral research\u000a      This includes large scale population-based exercise referral schemes in\u000a      Somerset (1999-2005), Greenwich (2005-2009) and South Staffordshire\u000a      (2009-2010). The research focussed on factors associated with patient\u000a      uptake, attendance and completion of the three independent schemes. The\u000a      research comprised a series of contracts awarded to the University of\u000a      Gloucestershire (Crone, James and Johnston) following\u000a      competitive tendering processes. These contracts also included\u000a      commissioned staff training and development, and quality assurance work.\u000a    The research contributed to a number of empirical findings (1, 2) and\u000a      practice-related findings (3, 4, and 5). As such, it has helped develop a\u000a      thorough understanding of the factors associated with patient engagement\u000a      (uptake, attendance and completion) including referral reason, age, gender\u000a      (4, 5) and a focus on complex socio-demographic factors, their measurement\u000a      and association (2, 3). In addition, and most substantively, the research\u000a      predominantly used an ecologically valid observational design to determine\u000a      factors associated with uptake and attendance outcomes (3, 4, and 5). The\u000a      primary findings were that factors associated with successful uptake and\u000a      completion include gender (more women take up, more men complete), age\u000a      (older), referral reason (physical reasons) and social-economic position\u000a      (less deprived). Mixed method research involving patients, referrers and\u000a      deliverers also confirmed the holistic multidimensional nature of\u000a      `success', rather than traditional notions of weight loss and blood\u000a      pressure reduction.\u000a    Art referral research\u000a      Involved developing evidence of effectiveness of a county scheme in\u000a      Gloucestershire, commissioned by the County Council and NHS (2007-2013).\u000a      The research team (Crone, James and Tyson) contributed to\u000a      the design, implementation and evaluation of an art referral intervention\u000a      based in primary care. The intervention targeted patients with\u000a      mild-moderate mental health problems and adopted a rigorous process and\u000a      outcome evaluation design not previously used in art referral\u000a      interventions. Research revealed the success of the intervention for\u000a      patients and practitioners (clinicians, commissioners and artists) who\u000a      identified the intervention as an alternative holistic option for the\u000a      treatment of mental health problems (6). Significant improvements in\u000a      mental wellbeing for patients were also found, with factors associated\u000a      with positive engagement identified as gender (women), age (older) and\u000a      more deprived socioeconomic groups.\u000a    The applied nature of this research has resulted in the research team\u000a      being involved in intervention and pathway design, in addition to\u000a      evaluation. This has been complemented by the inclusion of the research in\u000a      training materials for professionals involved in such interventions and\u000a      national policy recommendations.\u000a    To date Crone has published 48 articles, undertaken over 30\u000a      commissioned UK based research projects and secured two large EU grants\u000a      totalling over a &#163;1 million, co-authored one book, written five book\u000a      chapters, and presented nationally and in the EU. Publications selected as\u000a      the basis for the present impact are drawn from physical activity referral\u000a      research dating back to 1999 and arts referral research dating back to\u000a      2009.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23184","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Professor De Ste Croix's UEFA-funded research project, designed to\u000d\u000a      explore the effects of football match play on neuromuscular function and\u000d\u000a      injury risk in youth female footballers (in 2012), was important due to\u000d\u000a      increasing numbers in female participation in football and the increased\u000d\u000a      risk of injury in female players.1,3 Based on the findings of\u000d\u000a      the project, De Ste Croix was commissioned by the Football\u000d\u000a      Association (FA) to work in partnership on further research to inform\u000d\u000a      current practice in youth injury prevention.1 By working in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with FA Centres of Excellence (CoE) the application of De\u000a        Ste Croix's research is directly impacting individuals at risk of\u000d\u000a      injury (girls aged 8-17 years who have been identified as `at risk'\u000d\u000a      groups). The intervention programme that is underway with 12 CoE (circa\u000d\u000a      1000 girls) will be expanded to all 32 CoE (circa 2500 girls) in 2014.\u000d\u000a      This outreach work is looking to identify girls classified as at risk of\u000d\u000a      injury and to provide individualised training programmes to reduce injury\u000d\u000a      risk. This is the first national deployment of an intervention programme\u000d\u000a      directed at all girls participating in an FA CoE, and aimed at reducing\u000d\u000a      injuries of youth female footballers. Simultaneously, De Ste Croix\u000d\u000a      was also awarded a research grant from FIFA (the world governing body of\u000d\u000a      football) to build upon the findings of the UEFA-funded study, the remit\u000d\u000a      of this research being to `contribute to the world football family'. This\u000d\u000a      research is current, evolving and aims to explore the chronic effects of\u000d\u000a      football match play on neuromuscular readiness to re-perform in female\u000d\u000a      youth footballers. This research will inform and develop the current\u000d\u000a      globally accepted pre-habilitation programme (FIFA 11+) which is\u000d\u000a      used by over 30 million footballers worldwide. The current 11+ programme\u000d\u000a      has not been developed with paediatric populations in mind and therefore\u000d\u000a      is not deemed appropriate. This applied research on injury risk and\u000d\u000a      prevention in children is underpinned by De Ste Croix's expertise\u000d\u000a      in child neuromuscular functioning. The national and international reach\u000d\u000a      of this work is significant with 29 million girls and women participating\u000d\u000a      in football worldwide (source: FIFA `The Big Count').\u000d\u000a    Informing\/Changing Practice:\u000d\u000a    The above research has also led to De Ste Croix working directly\u000d\u000a      with a number of professional\/elite football clubs across Europe\u000d\u000a      including: FC Barcelona, SL Benfica, Athletic Club Bilbao, Bristol City\u000d\u000a      and Bristol Ladies Academy. In turn, the research has started to change\u000d\u000a      embedded pre-habilitation\/training practice in a relatively short space of\u000d\u000a      time in professional football clubs around the world, directly impacting\u000d\u000a      on around 1300 players.1,2,3,4,5 A member of the FC Barcelona\u000d\u000a      medical team states that: \"... this improvement in ACL prevention is a\u000d\u000a      direct result of the new training protocols introduced following Mark's\u000d\u000a      research. The medical staff at the club are also now more knowledgeable in\u000d\u000a      the area of physical mechanics as a result of the research put forward by\u000d\u000a      Mark.\".5 An additional impact that De Ste Croix's\u000d\u000a      research has had at FC Barcelona is an increased understanding and empathy\u000d\u000a      of pre-habilitation training for the women's team by the mainly male\u000d\u000a      medical staff. This has impacted on the women's team by increasing the\u000d\u000a      focus and attention given to the female players by the medical staff at\u000d\u000a      the club.5 As a direct result of De Ste Croix's\u000d\u000a      research Bristol City have also increased the time spent on neuromuscular\u000d\u000a      training programmes with its youth players, with the ultimate aim of\u000d\u000a      reducing non-contact injuries.2 Based on the research of De\u000d\u000a        Ste Croix, Bristol City have re-designed and implemented an\u000d\u000a      innovative pre-habilitation programme with all of their youth players\u000d\u000a      (ages 8-21 years) with a focus on the principles of movement control and\u000d\u000a      neuromuscular activity. This has led to Bristol City commissioning De\u000d\u000a        Ste Croix to evaluate the effectiveness of this change in practice.\u000d\u000a      Others, including a female team in the USA, have changed their practice by\u000d\u000a      implementing injury prevention work towards the end of training sessions\u000d\u000a      where fatigue is present.2,3 Head of Women's Soccer at Rider\u000d\u000a      University, New Jersey (USA) notes that: \"We implemented a change in\u000d\u000a      policy ... This change was a direct result of the research undertaken by\u000d\u000a      Mark and Gloucestershire.\".3 A physiotherapist at Athletic Club\u000d\u000a      Bilbao states that based on the research of De Ste Croix the club\u000d\u000a      have introduced a new training programme for their male youth players that\u000d\u000a      incorporates injury prevention in relation to muscle fatigue.4\u000d\u000a      This change in practice is a direct result of De Ste Croix's\u000d\u000a      research indicating that fatigue induces a large increase in injury risk.\u000d\u000a      The Football Association have also changed their policy by implementing\u000d\u000a      prevention programmes with National youth teams from 13 year-olds upwards.1\u000d\u000a      Previously such programmes were restricted to the senior teams but the\u000d\u000a      Head of Physiotherapy for the FA (Women) has stated that work by De\u000d\u000a        Ste Croix has \"... proved the applicability of certain training\u000d\u000a      methods to younger age groups. We have now implemented specific exercises\u000d\u000a      with the U13s and upwards that we used to employ with the senior team\u000d\u000a      only. This is a policy change that has occurred as a result of the work\u000d\u000a      with Gloucestershire.\".1\u000d\u000a    Reducing Injury Risk\u000d\u000a    Screening players for injury risk is an important part of reducing injury\u000d\u000a      incidence. As a direct result of the research undertaken by De Ste\u000d\u000a        Croix FC Barcelona and Athletic Club Bilbao have implemented\u000d\u000a      screening protocols using isokinetic testing with the specific intention\u000d\u000a      of reducing ACL injury.4,5 Although most of these professional\u000d\u000a      organisations have only recently changed their practice there is growing\u000d\u000a      evidence that this change has had an impact by reducing injury incidence.2,3,4,5\u000d\u000a      This work has included collecting injury incidence data as well as\u000d\u000a      mechanism data related to relative risk to help identify youth players at\u000d\u000a      risk.1,2,4 A physiotherapist at Athletic Club Bilbao notes: \"We\u000d\u000a      have implemented these testing techniques into our training programmes for\u000d\u000a      various groups already and we are checking injury levels and will have the\u000d\u000a      data soon. We are confident that the incidence of ACL injuries will be\u000d\u000a      reduced.\".4 FC Barcelona have confirmed a reduction in ACL\u000d\u000a      injuries (1 in 2013), and that the potential for that injury was\u000d\u000a      highlighted in the screening tests adopted following a change in practice\u000d\u000a      based on De Ste Croix's research. This change in practice has also\u000d\u000a      had a direct impact on the player as the medical team confirm that the\u000d\u000a      injury was easier to treat with less rehabilitation time required.5\u000d\u000a      Data from the FIFA funded research exploring the chronic effects of\u000d\u000a      fatigue accumulated during match play on injury risk and neuromuscular\u000d\u000a      readiness to re-perform is being used to inform and change training loads\u000d\u000a      and recovery strategies in youth footballers.2 Bristol City\u000d\u000a      Football Club are using these data to inform their practice in\u000d\u000a      implementing the FA's promotion of the new Elite Player Performance Plan\u000d\u000a      (EPPP), which advises on training hours for youth players.2 The\u000d\u000a      Academy Head of Sports Science and Medicine at Bristol City states that\u000d\u000a      the club's implementation of current FA policy is taking into account De\u000a        Ste Croix's research that age, maturation and fatigue for each\u000d\u000a      specific player is considered in devising and implementing their youth\u000d\u000a      training programmes. This is supported by the FA who state that the direct\u000d\u000a      improvements in training and recovery practices in elite youth sport that\u000d\u000a      are being implemented based on this research will, over time, see improved\u000d\u000a      health and well-being in sporting youth populations.1 The FA's\u000d\u000a      head physiotherapist for women's football concludes that: \"... as a direct\u000d\u000a      result of Mark's research we have found that we can influence the\u000d\u000a      prevalence of ACL injuries by implementing preventative measures at a\u000d\u000a      younger age range.\".1\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The research of Professor Mark De Ste Croix has begun to question\u000d\u000a      well-established practice in injury prevention and has proposed a change\u000d\u000a      in focus that is directly related to fatigue resistance.

De Ste Croix has\u000d\u000a      carried out work in three distinct but related areas:\u000d\u000a    1. The development of children's neuromuscular strength\u000d\u000a    The development of children's strength has not been well documented\u000d\u000a      especially in relation to eccentric muscle actions. De Ste Croix\u000d\u000a      is one of the few authors to have described the age and maturation related\u000d\u000a      changes in strength using isokinetic dynamometry and from longitudinal\u000d\u000a      data.a,e This has provided a clear understanding of when sex\u000d\u000a      differences start to emerge in strength development and have highlighted\u000d\u000a      that this divergence is both muscle group and muscle action specific.\u000d\u000a      Importantly, De Ste Croix has established the neuromuscular\u000d\u000a      mechanisms associated with the development of strength during childhood.\u000d\u000a      This has included using sophisticated equipment such as magnetic resonance\u000d\u000a      imaging and appropriate statistical techniques (allometric and multi-level\u000d\u000a      modelling). This has led to an increased knowledge in talent\u000d\u000a      identification and development models, challenging accepted practices and\u000d\u000a      re-evaluating perspectives.c Understanding the normal age and\u000d\u000a      sex-associated development in strength has provided a baseline from which\u000d\u000a      to explore changes that may increase or reduce injury risk and\u000d\u000a      subsequently how training might reduce this risk in paediatric\u000d\u000a      populations.\u000d\u000a    2. Injury risk and injury prevention in paediatric populations\u000d\u000a    There is a dramatic increase in injury incidence in children between the\u000d\u000a      ages of 11-16 years which might be ascribed to a number of neuromuscular,\u000d\u000a      maturation and biomechanical effects. De Ste Croix's work in this\u000d\u000a      area is underpinned by a number of highly competitive research grants from\u000d\u000a      FIFA, UEFA and the Football Association. Research that underpins this case\u000d\u000a      study has demonstrated that fatigue plays a key role in injury risk in\u000d\u000a      youth as it affects neuromuscular functioning. Importantly, the\u000d\u000a      detrimental effects on muscular and neuromuscular function is both age and\u000d\u000a      maturation specific.d These data reinforce the need for\u000d\u000a      organisations to re-evaluate their current provision for injury prevention\u000d\u000a      which is not individualised based on maturation stage. In particular, the\u000d\u000a      world-wide established FIFA 11+ (injury prevention programme) is\u000d\u000a      not suitable for children given that: (i) it does not focus on fatigue\u000d\u000a      resistance; and (ii) progressions are not suitable for maturational stages\u000d\u000a      of puberty.\u000d\u000a    3. Effectiveness of pre-habilitation programmes for injury prevention\u000d\u000a    De Ste Croix's work has examined whether commonly used stretching\u000d\u000a      techniques influence both muscular force production and neuromuscular\u000d\u000a      capability. These studies (2009-present) have indicated that stretching\u000d\u000a      does not influence neuromuscular functioning and should be included in\u000d\u000a      pre-habilitation programmes as they improve the range of movement and\u000d\u000a      subsequent length-tension relationship.f This research has also\u000d\u000a      informed current practice in eccentric conditioning by demonstrating\u000d\u000a      improvements in length-tension relationship and torque production after\u000d\u000a      eccentric training of the hamstring muscles. De Ste Croix's work\u000d\u000a      is influencing current knowledge and understanding of pre-habilitation\u000d\u000a      programmes for injury prevention in youth athletes by indicating that they\u000d\u000a      need to be maturational stage-specific, aimed at fatigue resistance, and\u000d\u000a      inclusive of stretching exercises and eccentric conditioning.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24002","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1) Children, teachers and local outdoor learning\u000a    Our research has informed policy development by Scotland's Ministers for\u000a      Education since 1999 and led to Higgins' appointment (2006-10) to\u000a      successive Ministerial Advisory Groups on outdoor learning in Scotland (Outdoor\u000a        Connections Advisory Group (2006-2008), Outdoor Learning\u000a        Strategic Advisory Group (2008-2010)) which reported on provision\u000a      and guided policy. The reports and curriculum guidance were based on our\u000a      research and led to `development officer' appointments at Education\u000a      Scotland (ES) (2006 &#8212; continuing), website development and `Curriculum for\u000a      Excellence (CfE) through Outdoor Learning' (2010) (5.1) (CfEtOL).\u000a      These developments were informed by part-Government-funded research\u000a      linking learning outdoors with CfE (Beames, Ross), teachers' approaches to\u000a      learning outdoors (Higgins, Nicol, Ross).CfEtOL is the first such national\u000a      policy in the UK or elsewhere. The ES website (5.2) addresses\u000a      issues highlighted in the research and the work of the advisory groups.\u000a      The `Outdoor Learning: Practical guidance, ideas and support for teachers\u000a      and practitioners in Scotland' section of the website uses our conceptual\u000a      framework and research (citing Beames, Higgins, Nicol, Ross). In 2010 ES\u000a      instigated a national CPD programme for teachers based on `Outdoor\u000a      Journeys'. Whilst having international relevance it relates specifically\u000a      to CfE, and is delivered in nationwide in-service programmes for teachers\u000a      (~1000), pre-service training at MHSE (~100 students\/year), Singapore,\u000a      Ireland, Italy (~100 students).\u000a    Christie et al. (5.3) surveyed schools throughout Scotland and\u000a      found that use of primary-school grounds had increased markedly, and\u000a      secondary schools indicated an increased desire to develop outdoor\u000a      learning since 2006. This shows that our research on local OE (Section 2\u000a      above), support materials and in-service provision (e.g. Outdoor Journeys)\u000a      has had an impact. In addition, over the past 10 years most Local\u000a      Authorities have established `outdoor learning groups', and residential\u000a      outdoor centre use has remained stable since our 2006 study despite\u000a      widespread budgetary pressures.\u000a    * Education Scotland' is the Scottish Government's education\u000a    advisory agency.

For simplicity all\u000a    references here are to `Education Scotland'.\u000a    2) Outdoor learning and sustainability education\u000a    In 2011 the Scottish Government made a manifesto commitment to explore\u000a      `education for sustainable development'\/`global citizenship' and, `outdoor\u000a      learning' in Scottish schools, and in recognition of our work, Higgins was\u000a      appointed chair of the Government's `One Planet Schools Ministerial\u000a      Advisory Group'. The group's `Learning for Sustainability' (LfS) report\u000a      (5.4) drew upon our existing research and commissioned literature reviews\u000a      (Christie, Higgins). The report made 31 recommendations which were all\u000a      accepted by the Government (March, 2013), including an internationally\u000a      rare entitlement to learning for sustainability and outdoor\u000a      learning (5.5). The Government's `Learning for sustainability\u000a      implementation group' (Higgins as chair) will implement the\u000a      recommendations throughout Scottish schools.\u000a    Our research on outdoor learning and sustainability resulted in Ross's\u000a      involvement in the revision of the General Teaching Council for\u000a        Scotland's `professional standards', which now require teachers to\u000a      address `learning for sustainability' and `outdoor learning' in their\u000a      practice (5.6).\u000a    Higgins, as the Scottish member of a UNESCO network on Reorienting\u000a        teacher education to address sustainability, initiated and guided\u000a      the development of the UN University `Regional Centre of Expertise in\u000a      Education for Sustainable Development for Scotland' (5.7). This was\u000a      approved in December 2012 and, following our research, has a significant\u000a      focus on outdoor learning. The Centre (located at MHSE) provides advice to\u000a      Scottish Government and aids delivery of the LfS report recommendations\u000a      (5.5).\u000a    Based on this research, staff deliver presentations and workshops for\u000a      professional and academic audiences throughout the UK and internationally,\u000a      extensive week-long CPD for Scottish and European teachers (EU Comenius\u000a      programme), and their approaches have been widely adopted by others for\u000a      international workshops (over 800 European teachers from 27 countries)\u000a      (5.8).

From 1950 to mid1980,\u000a      `outdoor education'\/'outdoor recreation' received little academic\u000a      attention. From 1990 to mid-2000 significant conceptual work emerged from\u000a      the University of Edinburgh's Moray House School of Education (MHSE),\u000a      notably from Higgins (at UoE since 1992, Professor since 2006), Nicol (p\/t\u000a      and f\/t since 2000), Beames (p\/t and f\/t since 2005) and Ross (since\u000a      2004). Scottish Government grants (&#163;61k, 2005-2007) facilitated work with\u000a      teachers and Local Authorities (1) and staff conducted MHSE-funded\u000a      research with Scottish school-children (2).\u000a    The conceptual support for Scottish outdoor education policy lies in our\u000a      work of the mid-1990s and features the now standard multi-dimensional\u000a      concept of outdoor education (defined above). Our work emphasised the\u000a      importance of research-informed concept-based programming (3). Our concept\u000a      of local `outdoor learning' as a pragmatic place-based approach has been\u000a      further developed, with staff focussing on curriculum\/policy, and\u000a      philosophical, sociological, practical and recreational aspects of the\u000a      field (4). Our critique of short-duration, weakly curriculum-linked,\u000a      strictly regulated adventure activities has been a major influence on\u000a      international re-examination of outdoor learning and its evidence-base\u000a      (2). Government and charitable-trust funding supported our studies of\u000a      local authorities, schools and teachers, and recognition of pupils'\u000a      achievements (1), consequently facilitating policy development for\u000a      locally-based outdoor learning. Related work on the socio-economics of\u000a      land-ownership and access to the countryside, and the centrality of access\u000a      for education and recreation established links to a broader policy agenda.\u000a      Our research-informed Learning Outside the Classroom (4) has\u000a      become a standard text.\u000a    1) Children, teachers and local outdoor learning\u000a    Our research on teachers' attitudes to the natural heritage (1) indicated\u000a      barriers to involvement in outdoor learning. This, with work above, led to\u000a      conceptual developments (e.g. a model emphasising initial local learning\u000a      before progressing further afield and then residentials), and associated\u000a      research (2) called `Outdoor Journeys' based on pupils `developing\u000a      questions about the local area', `researching' and `sharing findings'.\u000a      Findings from the studies above led to Esm&#233;e Fairbairn Trust funding for a\u000a      two-year action-research initiative (2011-13) examining outdoor learning\u000a      provision for the early secondary phase in Scotland. This has led to\u000a      greater understanding of the conditions that facilitate improved outdoor\u000a      learning, and by comparing findings with our 2006 study (5), demonstrated\u000a      significant growth and interest in outdoor learning, related to the policy\u000a      developments we have supported.\u000a    2) Outdoor learning and sustainability education\u000a    A consistent theme of our work (members of staff plus research fellow,\u000a      research assistant, five PhD students (three graduated since 2008) since\u000a      the 1990s has been the relationship between outdoor learning\/recreational\u000a      experiences and sustainability education. Our research reviews\u000a      demonstrated a link between formative outdoor educational experiences and\u000a      an orientation towards sustainability, and reconceptualised the discipline\u000a      by exploring the potential of outdoor experiences to operate as moral\u000a      impulses in the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24003","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The HBSC provides a unique data set for investigating why some\u000d\u000a      health-related trends in children and young people are increasing and\u000d\u000a      other trends decreasing by facilitating comparisons internationally. HBSC\u000d\u000a      data has been used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe to provide a\u000d\u000a      report on the social determinants of young people's health. This report\u000d\u000a      was highly commended by the British Medical Association (5.1). The\u000d\u000a      evidence from the HBSC data contributed to the Children's Environment and\u000d\u000a      Health Action Plan for Europe (CEHAPE) Regional Priority Goal II: \"To\u000d\u000a        prevent and substantially reduce health consequences from accidents and\u000d\u000a        injuries and pursue a decrease in morbidity from lack of adequate\u000d\u000a        physical activity by promoting safe, secure and supportive human\u000d\u000a        settlements for all children.\" In relation to physical activity this\u000d\u000a      resulted in a WHO Europe resource `Young and physically active' which uses\u000d\u000a      the HBSC data set to provide a rationale for the need to prioritise youth\u000d\u000a      activity in Europe (5.2; page 4). The importance of the HBSC data has also\u000d\u000a      been recognised by UNICEF who used HBSC to inform their thinking on health\u000d\u000a      inequalities (5.3; Innocent Report Card 9, The Children Left Behind) and\u000d\u000a      in which the HBSC measure of physical activity was used as a key indicator\u000d\u000a      of well-being (5.3: see page 14, Innocenti Report Card 9).

Other available data were only cross-sectional\u000d\u000a      which had clear limitations in determining the temporal pattern of PA. As\u000d\u000a      a result, adolescent girls were singled out in this five year review as a\u000d\u000a      priority group. In 2010 the Minister for Sport and the Commonwealth Games\u000d\u000a      commissioned a \"Teenage Girls\" summit, which was held in August 2010 at\u000d\u000a      the University of Edinburgh, and to which Jo Inchley was an invited\u000d\u000a      expert. Feedback gathered at the Summit, including information from the\u000d\u000a      HBSC and PASS data sets, was collated into a final report that was used to\u000d\u000a      inform recommendations to the Minister (5.5, page 3.)\u000d\u000a    The PASS report informed the following programmes by providing the\u000d\u000a      evidence for the kind of activities that girls wanted: Fit for Girls;\u000d\u000a      Y-Dance; Girls on the Move; Active Travel to School \/ Primary-Secondary\u000d\u000a      Transition project; I Bike and `simple steps to success'.\u000d\u000a    Jo Inchley was invited to contribute to the development and design of Fit\u000d\u000a      for Girls. By the end of the Fit for Girls programme 32 local authorities\u000d\u000a      had taken part in training and committed to delivery of the programme; 344\u000d\u000a      mainstream schools and 15 schools for pupils with additional support needs\u000d\u000a      were engaged with the programme; 106 workshops had taken place. The girls\u000d\u000a      themselves and PE staff reported increased participation as a result of\u000d\u000a      the Fit for Girls programme (5.6).\u000d\u000a    Inchley also advised on the production of a Paths for All resource about\u000d\u000a      pedometer use for young people `Simple Steps to Success'. The resource\u000d\u000a      used the evidence from the PASS report to inform the production of the\u000d\u000a      programme. The resource was sent to every primary and secondary school in\u000d\u000a      Scotland. On page 19 it is noted that `Child and Adolescent Health\u000d\u000a        Research Unit (CAHRU) at Edinburgh University: produced the research\u000d\u000a      that gave rise to this guide.' (5.7)\u000d\u000a    On the basis of the reputation of the HBSC and PASS work, Jo Inchley was\u000d\u000a      invited to be one of five advisors to the Government funded Scottish\u000d\u000a      Physical Activity Collaboration (SPARColl) from 2006-2011. Through\u000d\u000a      SPARColl she advised on the evaluation of physical activity programmes in\u000d\u000a      young people for NHS Health Scotland and for a knowledge exchange\u000d\u000a      programme on physical activity in adolescent girls in 2008\/2009 (funded by\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Funding Council). This programme involved events for\u000d\u000a      practitioners, policy makers and key academics with a focus on addressing\u000d\u000a      knowledge gaps and facilitating on-going dialogue between partners. The\u000d\u000a      programme highlighted practitioners' need for more evidence regards the\u000d\u000a      importance of role models in adolescent girls, and the type of role model\u000d\u000a      that was effective. This element of the project drew heavily on the work\u000d\u000a      of CAHRU. It also identified a need for practitioners to be informed on\u000d\u000a      how to effectively consult with adolescent girls regards their physical\u000d\u000a      activity needs. The outcomes were a set of resources which can be seen in\u000d\u000a      the Teenactive report. CAHRU's role was to write the resource associated\u000d\u000a      with `The Importance of Role Models in Making Adolescent Girls More\u000d\u000a      Active' (5.8).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Physical inactivity is a global health risk.

These researchers were all employed at the University of\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh until 2011).\u000d\u000a    The data demonstrated that as children grow, activity levels fall (a\u000d\u000a      significantly higher frequency of daily physical activity was found among\u000d\u000a      boys aged 11 than those aged 15 in most countries and regions) and\u000d\u000a      universally, girls are less active than boys. The most active regions are\u000d\u000a      Ireland and Austria while the least active are Denmark and Italy. This\u000d\u000a      project provided data that has been used globally to inform policy and to\u000d\u000a      make international comparisons of physical activity levels and associated\u000d\u000a      health parameters in young people and nationally to inform policy and\u000d\u000a      practice (2,3).\u000d\u000a    2) Physical Activity in Scottish School Children (PASS)\u000d\u000a    PASS was a longitudinal research study tracking levels of physical\u000d\u000a      activity across the primary-secondary transition over 5 years. The study\u000d\u000a      utilised an ecological framework which encompassed psychological, social\u000d\u000a      and environmental influences. Over 1500 schoolchildren from eight school\u000d\u000a      clusters in Angus, Fife, Glasgow City and West Lothian were involved in\u000d\u000a      the study. Data were collected by questionnaire survey undertaken in 2002\u000d\u000a      among P7 (Year 6 equivalent) pupils with five waves of data collection.\u000d\u000a      Qualitative interviews were also undertaken with a subgroup of pupils in\u000d\u000a      P7 and S2 (Year 8 equivalent) (2002 and 2007). The key staff involved were\u000d\u000a      Jo Inchley and Candace Currie. This was the first longitudinal study of\u000d\u000a      Scottish school children across the primary\/secondary school transition.\u000d\u000a      It identified a decrease in physical activity across the primary-secondary\u000d\u000a      school transition, with a further decline during the secondary school\u000d\u000a      years. The decrease was more acute for girls than for boys. The PASS\u000d\u000a      report also provided evidence for the kind of activities that girls wanted\u000d\u000a      to do (4, 5).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24004","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has influenced policy and practice in the UK and\u000d\u000a      internationally by contributing to\u000d\u000a      clinical guidelines and through training with health and exercise\u000d\u000a      professionals working with stroke\u000d\u000a      survivors.\u000d\u000a    The Cochrane Review on fitness after stroke: influencing clinical\u000d\u000a        practice\u000d\u000a    Cochrane systematic reviews help providers, practitioners and patients\u000d\u000a      make informed decisions\u000d\u000a      about health care, and are the most comprehensive, reliable and relevant\u000d\u000a      source of evidence (The\u000d\u000a      Cochrane Collaboration http:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/cochrane-reviews).\u000d\u000a    The 2012 update of our Cochrane systematic review of fitness training\u000d\u000a      (Brazzelli et al. 2012) is the\u000d\u000a      4th most cited Cochrane review about stroke and the 7th most accessed\u000d\u000a      Cochrane review (2,164\u000d\u000a      full-text accesses during 2011) about stroke (5.1.

Impaired fitness is associated\u000d\u000a      with post-stroke disability.\u000d\u000a      Many stroke survivors require rehabilitation, but fitness training was not\u000d\u000a      included in most\u000d\u000a      programmes.\u000d\u000a    This programme of research has:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      developed a rationale for physical fitness training after stroke;\u000d\u000a      examined the evidence of effect for whether exercise is beneficial\u000d\u000a        after stroke; and\u000d\u000a      explored the barriers and motivators for stroke survivors to\u000d\u000a        participate in exercise.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The key evidence was produced by Professor Gillian Mead and Dr David\u000d\u000a      Saunders (both at the\u000d\u000a      University of Edinburgh since 2001).\u000d\u000a    The methods used include observational studies, systematic reviews (which\u000d\u000a      collate all available\u000d\u000a      high-quality evidence), and meta-analyses which determine statistically\u000d\u000a      the various effects of\u000d\u000a      exercise after stroke. This research is designed to generate\u000d\u000a      recommendations for evidence-based\u000d\u000a      practice (and research).\u000d\u000a    a) Developing the rationale for exercise after stroke\u000d\u000a    Systematic review methodology demonstrated that aerobic fitness is\u000d\u000a      substantially impaired after\u000d\u000a      stroke (1). This is important because low aerobic fitness is likely to\u000d\u000a      increase the risk of recurrent\u000d\u000a      stroke and exacerbate post-stroke disability. Original research (2) showed\u000d\u000a      that impaired muscle\u000d\u000a      power in the lower limb unaffected by stroke is associated with important\u000d\u000a      functional impairments\u000d\u000a      e.g. time taken to rise from a chair. Furthermore, impaired lower limb\u000d\u000a      muscle power is associated\u000d\u000a      with fatigue (3), which affects about 40% of stroke survivors and is one\u000d\u000a      of the most distressing\u000d\u000a      post-stroke symptoms. These observational data justify the testing of\u000d\u000a      exercise training\u000d\u000a      interventions to improve physical function and disability after stroke.\u000d\u000a    b) Synthesis and meta-analysis of evidence for physical fitness\u000d\u000a        training after stroke\u000d\u000a    The principal research outputs are a series of systematic reviews\u000d\u000a      produced in association with the\u000d\u000a      Cochrane Collaboration (`Physical fitness training for stroke patients';\u000d\u000a      3, 4). These systematic\u000d\u000a      reviews and meta-analyses synthesised all available evidence from clinical\u000d\u000a      trials of exercise\u000d\u000a      training after stroke in order to determine whether exercise interventions\u000d\u000a      are beneficial for people\u000d\u000a      with stroke. Individual clinical trials generally do not provide adequate\u000d\u000a      evidence to form clinical\u000d\u000a      guidelines for exercise after stroke, whilst meta-analyses provide the\u000d\u000a      best level of evidence to\u000d\u000a      answer clinical questions like these. For the last 10 years Mead and\u000d\u000a      Saunders have led the\u000d\u000a      production and updating of this body of evidence.\u000d\u000a    These meta-analyses have identified the effects of physical fitness\u000d\u000a      training for patients. For\u000d\u000a      example, cardiorespiratory training leads to clinically important\u000d\u000a      improvements in mobility in stroke\u000d\u000a      patients when provided as part of their rehabilitation. This is important\u000d\u000a      because mobility is an\u000d\u000a      outcome which is valued by stroke patients themselves. The evidence from\u000d\u000a      the systematic reviews\u000d\u000a      and meta-analyses is of sufficiently high quality to justify the inclusion\u000d\u000a      of exercise training into\u000d\u000a      rehabilitation of stroke survivors.\u000d\u000a    Our research programme has also focussed on the implementation of this\u000d\u000a      evidence in practice.\u000d\u000a      For example, a systematic review found that key barriers to exercise were\u000d\u000a      lack of motivation,\u000d\u000a      environmental factors (e.g. transport), health concerns, and stroke\u000d\u000a      impairments; and the key\u000d\u000a      motivators were social support and the need to be able to perform daily\u000d\u000a      tasks (5).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"26411","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since the 2007 publication of the White Paper on Sport, sport has\u000a      had a prominent place in the\u000a      European Union's policy agenda.

During\u000a      this time he has\u000a      undertaken a significant body of research, partly in collaboration with\u000a      Worcester Colleagues (Dr Jo\u000a      Marshall, 2005-07; Professor Derek Peters, 2001-present; Karen Van Berlo,\u000a      1999-present)\u000a      focused on the global provision of physical education (PE) in schools and\u000a      the implications for child\u000a      health of this provision and, simultaneously, the provision and\u000a      effectiveness of training for PE\u000a      teachers across Europe.\u000a    Global Provision of PE\u000a    In 2005, as part of the United Nations Year of Sport &amp; Physical\u000a      Education, Hardman and Marshall\u000a      were commissioned by the International Council of Sport Science and\u000a      Physical Education\u000a      (ICSSPE) to undertake a second worldwide survey of PE. The survey sought\u000a      to assess the\u000a      worldwide provision of school PE and note developments since the Berlin\u000a      Physical Education\u000a      Summit in 1999 and their first worldwide survey published in 2002. A\u000a      multi-method approach was\u000a      adopted with analysis of a range of sources comprising global, national\u000a      and regional surveys,\u000a      continental regional and national PE-related projects, case studies and a\u000a      comprehensive literature\u000a      review. The pluralistic methods facilitated data collection on national\u000a      level policies and practice-related\u000a      issues in school PE, the PE curriculum, resources (human and material),\u000a      the PE\u000a      environment (school subject and PE teacher status; and pathway links to PE\u000a      activity in out-of-school\u000a      settings) and `Best Practice' exemplars.\u000a    Outcomes of the survey were reported in progress on a European level (see\u000a      References 1 and 3)\u000a      and on a global level (see Reference 4). The final survey report (Reference\u000a        5) found encouraging\u000a      policy actions had been made to reverse the previously identified\u000a      marginalisation of the PE\u000a      curriculum; however, many of these policies had been slow to action and\u000a      consequently the survey\u000a      findings reported that:\u000a    (i) PE was not being implemented in line with policy\u000a    (ii) there was a lack of allocated curriculum time for PE\u000a    (iii) teachers were inadequately trained, especially in primary education\u000a    (iv) there were inadequate PE facilities and equipment due to restricted\u000a      funding\u000a    (v) there was a lack of provision and links with community sport\u000a      programmes and facilities\u000a    The survey further identified a focus on competitive sport experiences\u000a      which limited participation\u000a      rather than expanding horizons. The research also questioned the\u000a      effectiveness of various global,\u000a      national and regional charters and policies since the survey reported no\u000a      change in the state of PE\u000a      in economically under-developed countries and variation in the actual\u000a      level of compliance to policy\u000a      at local level and extensive commentary from survey respondents that\u000a      practice does not match\u000a      policy.

By improving screening sensitivity, these activities\u000d\u000a      have had a beneficial impact on the patients' quality of life, their\u000d\u000a      families and society in general. We anticipate that this will improve on\u000d\u000a      the current 53% risk reduction in AAA-related deaths and mean cost\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of &#163;28k per patient per life-year gained.\u000d\u000a    Similar approaches have been applied to stroke patients scheduled for\u000d\u000a      elective carotid endarterectomy, a surgical procedure that corrects\u000d\u000a      carotid stenosis improving perfusion to the brain. Bailey's Group\u000d\u000a      have shown that the speed of surgical repair (ie. reducing the time\u000d\u000a      that clamps are applied to the diseased artery) dictates the extent of\u000d\u000a      free radical formation and corresponding neurocognitive decline that\u000d\u000a      persists during the post-operative recovery phase, highlighting why\u000d\u000a      \"surgical speed\" is so critical for patient outcome. Furthermore, it was\u000d\u000a      generally accepted that this procedure improves cognitive function, due in\u000d\u000a      part to increased cerebral perfusion. This was \"misinformed\" given that\u000d\u000a      prior investigators consistently failed to take into account learning\u000d\u000a      effects. As a consequence, patients are now being advised cognitive\u000d\u000a      function will be impaired during the recovery period thereby reducing\u000d\u000a      post-operative stress.\u000d\u000a    Given that arterial hypoxaemia is a common feature of vascular disease\u000d\u000a      with the capacity to stimulate free radical formation, the group have also\u000d\u000a      focused on chronic mountain sickness (CMS), a novel model of accelerated\u000d\u000a      vascular ageing and decreased longevity. Recognised by the World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation, CMS affects 5-10% of an estimated 140 million natives living\u000d\u000a      at altitude with treatment largely ineffective. They identified that CMS\u000d\u000a      was associated with impaired systemic vascular structure\/function due to a\u000d\u000a      free radical-mediated reduction in the vascular bioavailability of nitric\u000d\u000a      oxide. Similar to the surgical patients previously outlined, this was\u000d\u000a      attributed to a selective depletion in the antioxidant vitamin C,\u000d\u000a      providing clear justification for antioxidant prophylaxis as a viable\u000d\u000a      clinical intervention. In collaboration with the Bolivian High Altitude\u000d\u000a      Biology Institute (IBBA), pharmacological (iv ascorbate infusion)\u000d\u000a      and dietary (fresh fruit and vegetables) approaches have since been\u000d\u000a      deployed to increase the concentration of circulating antioxidants,\u000d\u000a      interventions that are already having a positive impact on patient health\u000d\u000a      and well-being (personal communication, Dr M Villena, IBBA).\u000d\u000a    Extending this work from the systemic to the cerebral circulation, novel\u000d\u000a      cerebrovascular function tests have been deployed within the sporting\u000d\u000a      context, notably in mountaineers to screen for \"subtle\" imperfections in\u000d\u000a      brain blood flow regulation that can be detected even at sea-level and\u000d\u000a      inform the risk of developing altitude-related illnesses during ascent to\u000d\u000a      high-altitude.

Similar tests have been applied for the\u000d\u000a      detection of subtle brain injury following concussion, a novel model of\u000d\u000a      accelerated brain ageing that increases susceptibility to dementia. A\u000d\u000a      recent publication in professional boxers highlighted that the majority of\u000d\u000a      brain injury occurs due to the mechanical trauma incurred by repetitive,\u000d\u000a      sub-concussive head impacts associated with sparring \"training\" and not as\u000d\u000a      traditionally believed, due to a single knockout blow during\u000d\u000a      \"competition\".

These works were subsequently extended to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate that resting and exercise-induced free radical formation was\u000d\u000a      more pronounced in old compared to young skeletal muscle (i), providing\u000d\u000a      the first human evidence in support of the Free Radical Theory of\u000d\u000a      Ageing postulated more than half a century ago. Follow-up studies provided\u000d\u000a      a mechanistic basis to explain why vascular endothelial function becomes\u000d\u000a      impaired with ageing which was attributed to a free radical-mediated\u000d\u000a      reduction in the vascular bioavailability of the vasodilator molecule\u000d\u000a      nitric oxide. These studies also highlighted the vascular benefits of\u000d\u000a      antioxidant prophylaxis which has implications for slowing down the ageing\u000d\u000a      process. The observation that exercise-induced free radical formation was\u000d\u000a      associated with a reduction in mitochondrial oxygenation led to a focus on\u000d\u000a      hypoxia involving collaborations with the Universities of Heidelberg\u000d\u000a      (B&#228;rtsch) and Copenhagen (Pedersen, Saltin, M&#246;ller and Secher) with\u000d\u000a      funding from the Danish Research Council to support a post-doctoral\u000d\u000a      researcher (Evans). The research provided the first human\u000d\u000a        evidence that free radical formation increased during hypoxia,\u000d\u000a      contrary to traditional opinion. The brain and lungs were later\u000d\u000a      indentified as \"regional generators\" allowing the team to calculate for\u000d\u000a        the first time, local rates of free radical turnover (ii, iii). The\u000d\u000a      findings also provided unique insight into the pathophysiology of\u000d\u000a      high-altitude illness, notably the neurological and pulmonary syndromes of\u000d\u000a      acute mountain sickness, high-altitude cerebral and pulmonary oedema.\u000d\u000a      Contrary to prevailing dogma, it was later suggested that in\u000d\u000a      physiologically controlled albeit undefined amounts, free radical\u000d\u000a      formation in hypoxia may prove an adaptive phenomenon that can accelerate\u000d\u000a      acclimatisation and boost exercise performance, akin to human\u000d\u000a      \"oxygen-sensing\".

While (repeated) exposures to hypoxia have been used by\u000d\u000a      athletes to improve sea-level aerobic performance for decades, emerging\u000d\u000a      evidence suggests that it is a primary cause of the vascular dysfunction\u000d\u000a      and premature mortality associated with clinical diseases including OSA.\u000d\u000a    One of the primary mechanisms underpinning adaptation to repeated\u000d\u000a      exposures to hypoxia involves secretion of erythropoietin (Epo), which\u000d\u000a      stimulates the production of new red blood cells eventually leading to an\u000d\u000a      improvement in physical performance subsequent to improved oxygen\u000d\u000a      delivery. However, despite this adaptation, exercise capacity is equally\u000d\u000a      impaired in hypoxia, hindering the benefits of training carried out at\u000d\u000a      altitude. As a consequence, more complex models of hypoxic training\u000d\u000a      including the `Live High-Train Low' (LHTL) paradigm have been developed.\u000d\u000a      This consists of living in hypoxia in order to stimulate Epo, while\u000d\u000a      training at sea level allows the athlete to maintain their \"normal\"\u000d\u000a      training intensity. This model has grown in popularity amongst athletes\u000d\u000a      though raised concerns with the IOC in terms of its legitimacy as an\u000d\u000a      ergogenic aid. Grants awarded by the IOC and the French Ministry of Sport\u000d\u000a      allowed Brugniaux to further optimise the efficacy and safety of\u000d\u000a      the LHTL model (i) demonstrating for the first time in an elite\u000d\u000a      population that it can improve aerobic, endurance-based performance (ii).\u000d\u000a      More recently, Brugniaux has focused on the development of\u000d\u000a      additional novel IHT paradigms that have been exploited by a\u000d\u000a      number of World-Class endurance athletes optimising their preparation for\u000d\u000a      the London 2012 Olympic Games and expeditionary members including Richard\u000d\u000a      Parks (see 4).\u000d\u000a    OSA is a common sleep disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of\u000d\u000a      complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway. These intermittent\u000d\u000a      occlusions result in chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) that involves\u000d\u000a      repeated episodes of arterial desaturation. Importantly, OSA patients are\u000d\u000a      more prone to vascular disease. In an attempt to explore the independent\u000d\u000a      role of hypoxia in the pathophysiology of this disease, Brugniaux\u000d\u000a      developed a novel model of intermittent hypoxia that involved\u000d\u000a      cycles of 2 minutes of hypoxia followed by 2 minutes of normoxia\u000d\u000a      specifically designed to simulate the apnoeic phases associated with OSA.\u000d\u000a      This study provided mechanistic insight into the ventilatory\u000d\u000a      response to CIH highlighting the fundamental pathways that led to a\u000d\u000a      systemic increase in Epo (iii) and free radical concentrations (iv)\u000d\u000a      providing a metabolic basis to explain the increased ventilatory\u000d\u000a      sensitivity and vascular impairment in hypoxia, supporting earlier\u000d\u000a      research conducted by Bailey (v).

This was a four year\u000a      project (October, 2007 - November, 2011) funded by the All Saints\u000a      Education Trust (&#163;125,000) and the Big Lottery Fund\/Local Food (&#163;10,000).\u000a      The Cooking Communities Project established a series of school-based\u000a      community cooking clubs (17 in total) in disadvantaged areas of West\u000a      Yorkshire, and aimed to develop young people's (11-18 years) food\u000a      preparation and cooking skills while also enhancing their understanding of\u000a      different generational and ethnic cultures. These clubs delivered 10 week\u000a      cooking courses (to approximately 250 children), which were led by food\u000a      technology teachers and `cooking champions'. These cooking champions were\u000a      older adults (between 50 and 85 years) from the local community who\u000a      volunteered to take part in the project (25 took part in total).\u000a    The impact of the Cooking Communities Project can be summarised in the\u000a      following areas:\u000a    Nutritional Awareness: The project was successful in increasing\u000a      the practical cooking skills and nutritional knowledge of both the\u000a      children and cooking champions, helping to promote an awareness of healthy\u000a      eating. The after-school cooking clubs succeeded in increasing pupils'\u000a      enthusiasm and skills in food preparation and cooking. Interest in\u000a      cultural foods and cooking increased among those who participated in the\u000a      project, in addition to an increase in the frequency of cooking at home as\u000a      well. Importantly, the older adults who volunteered as cooking champions\u000a      also increased their food knowledge. For example, there was an increase in\u000a      the number of Champions making spicy and Asian foods at home after the\u000a      pilots. One of the cooking champions commented: \"I have thoroughly enjoyed\u000a      being part of this pilot project; it has been a learning curve for me. I\u000a      can now make a hot curry sauce and use spices I have not tried before and\u000a      which I will continue to use.\"\u000a    Community cohesion: By bringing together children and older adults\u000a      from the community, social barriers were broken down and the level of\u000a      respect between generations increased. Furthermore, involving community\u000a      elders in this manner increased their sense of self-worth and contribution\u000a      to their community. The project team established links with local\u000a      charities\/organisations within the community, such as Caring\u000a        Together in Little London and Woodhouse, Meanwood Elderly, STEP\u000a(Supporting\u000a        the Elderly People) and the Extended\u000a        Services Inner North West Hub to recruit these cooking champions.\u000a      Before the cooking clubs, the cooking champions reported young people to\u000a      be `loud and bad mannered' and `intimidating when in groups on the\u000a      street', whereas after being involved in the projected they reported that\u000a      young people are `fun, energetic and enthusiastic.' One Cooking Champion\u000a      commented: \"Best bit was spending time with a group of young people, they\u000a      were keen to learn and it was great to help and be part of this project.\"\u000a    Local economic activity: The cooking clubs also helped to support\u000a      local businesses and stimulate local economic activity. All ingredients\u000a      used in the cooking clubs were provided freely to the schools.\u000a      Importantly, all ingredients were sourced from local suppliers such as Doorstep Organics and Sykes House Farm, and from\u000a      community based projects such as Fresh\u000a        `n' Fruity (a lottery funded initiative that provides affordable\u000a      fruit and vegetables by establishing market stalls in deprived\u000a      communities). During the course of the project over &#163;6,000 was spent at\u000a      these outlets, providing significant financial support to local businesses\u000a      and helping to educate children and their families about the benefits of\u000a      local food.\u000a    Educational training &amp; course development: Alongside the\u000a      afterschool cooking clubs, a range of educational training resources were\u000a      developed and freely distributed to schools across Yorkshire and\u000a      Humberside. These resources included information regarding nutritional\u000a      guidelines, hygiene training and recipe packs, and were designed to allow\u000a      schools to establish their own cooking clubs. To date, over 150 resource\u000a      packs have been dispatched to schools across Yorkshire and Humberside.\u000a      Furthermore, the course materials developed as part of the Cooking\u000a      Communities Project have been used in the development and delivery (by\u000a      Gatenby) of a Food Specialism Training Course for Higher Level Teaching\u000a      Assistants (HLTA) run by Leeds Trinity University.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study highlights the impact of Leeds Trinity's Cooking\u000a      Communities Project in promoting intergenerational and multicultural\u000a      community relations through afterschool cooking clubs.

This work was initiated at\u000a      the University of Hull (2003 - 2006) and has been continued at Leeds\u000a      Trinity University (2006 - to date). Her work has included an evaluation\u000a      of Hull City Council's healthy school meals scheme (initiated in 2004),\u000a      which provides free school meals to approximately 20,500 children in\u000a      primary and special schools to help reduce health inequalities. Gatenby\u000a      recorded lunch time intakes using weighed records and weighed food diaries\u000a      to capture details of food consumed at home. The research established\u000a      important differences between the food portions provided in school and the\u000a      actual food consumed, which resulted in children failing to meet the\u000a      recommended School Food Trust nutritional guidelines (Gatenby, 2007;\u000a      Gatenby, 2010a; Gatenby, 2011a).\u000a    This work has been extended by evaluating the impact of developing\u000a      practical cooking skills in school children. While it has been suggested\u000a      that teaching young people practical cooking skills may improve dietary\u000a      quality, schools have reported that the current food technology lessons\u000a      are unable to include enough practical food preparation and cooking\u000a      sessions to help children develop the necessary life skills (Gatenby,\u000a      2010b).\u000a    The need for such cooking clubs that develop practical cooking skills in\u000a      children was clearly demonstrated by initial survey work which highlighted\u000a      that 27% of the secondary school pupils who participated in the after\u000a      school cooking clubs did not know how to open a tin, 34% did not know how\u000a      to boil and egg and 20% could not follow a recipe (Gatenby, 2011b).\u000a      However, an evaluation survey of the project indicated that the cooking\u000a      clubs significantly improved the children's ability to prepare food and\u000a      cook healthy foods\/meals (Gatenby, 2011b). Importantly, by bringing\u000a      together children and adults from varying backgrounds, individuals were\u000a      also able to share cooking and eating experiences, which helped break down\u000a      barriers between generations and cultures. The evaluations demonstrated\u000a      that when different age groups worked together, respect increased across\u000a      the generations (Gatenby et al. 2010). Furthermore, the older\u000a      adults who acted as cooking champions also reported increases in their\u000a      sense of self-worth and contribution to their community (Gatenby, 2011b).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31134","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"286963","Name":"Oman"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Perry is a founding member of the International Centre for Mental\u000a      Toughness Development, which is run by AQR Ltd, an international test\u000a      publisher and business consultancy. As a group, there are currently\u000a      several key current projects demonstrating an educational impact.\u000a    The validation of the MTQ48 has proved important for a number of\u000a      educational bodies who use it as routine. For example the Institute of\u000a      Leadership &amp; Management (ILM) is the UK's largest management body,\u000a      combining industry-leading qualifications and specialist member services.\u000a      In 2011, 90,000 people gained an ILM qualification. The MTQ48 is available\u000a      free of charge to its members and is incorporated into a number of their\u000a      courses. Also, in 2011, Dubai Women's College established the Middle\u000a      East's first mental toughness centre for education. This will act as a hub\u000a      for the International Centre for Mental Toughness Development in the\u000a      U.A.E.\u000a    There are presently several ongoing funded projects to demonstrate the\u000a      educational impact.

Right Track is an initiative delivering bespoke packages of\u000a      support to 4,500 young people (school years 6, 9, 10 and 11) from across\u000a      the United Kingdom, including Mental Toughness assessments (validated by\u000a      Perry) and a ten-week coaching programme (developed by Dr. Clough at\u000a      University of Hull) in order to improve attainment, attendance, behaviour\u000a      and ultimately progression of the target cohort. Initial evaluation has\u000a      shown that 49% of the sample increased their mental toughness over this\u000a      time period. Of this group, the average increase in mental toughness was\u000a      19%. The impact of this was that those indicating a desire to study\u000a      full-time after year 11 rose from 17% to 28%, pupils indicating that they\u000a      liked being at school rise from 53% to 60%, and pupils believing that\u000a      \"teachers are always getting at me\" dropped from 40% to 29%. Teacher\u000a      feedback was similarly positive, suggesting that 45% of pupils improved\u000a      their behaviour, 33% improved their attendance, and 46% improved their\u000a      work in class. Indeed, attendance data highlights that of those pupils\u000a      with attendance below 85% at the beginning of the project, 73% improved\u000a      their attendance (on average, by 6.2%).\u000a    The main input from Perry in this project is two-fold. Firstly, he\u000a      conducted the statistical analysis from the first phase of the project.\u000a      Secondly, he has been central to the development and validation of a\u000a      career management tool, \"Carrus\", which assesses ability and\u000a      behaviour-based personality traits, creating reports to help career\u000a      management for young people, which is to be provided alongside the MTQ48.\u000a    Greater Merseyside Connexions (GMC) have started a 3-year project working\u000a      with 3,900 vulnerable young people mostly aged 14-16. The purpose is to\u000a      identify ways of preventing these becoming labelled as NEETs (Not in\u000a      Education, Employment or Training). It includes people in public care,\u000a      people with a learning difficulty and young offenders. GMC are keen to\u000a      work with Leeds Trinity to improve the behaviour and attendance of the\u000a      young people, and to help them acquire qualifications and employment, by\u000a      testing and improving mental toughness.\u000a    HULT International Business School run the biggest international MBA\u000a      programme in the world across 6 campuses; London, Boston, San Francisco,\u000a      Shanghai, Dubai and Sao Paulo. They are about to open a seventh in New\u000a      York. For the last year they have been using the MTQ48 on all students at\u000a      the beginning and end of their MBA and are then tracking their employment\u000a      post- graduation.\u000a    Mental toughness is not just beneficial to students, but to teachers\u000a      also. Teaching Leaders (TL) is an organisation aiming to develop what they\u000a      refer to as \"middle leaders\" to enable them to take up more senior\u000a      positions in education. There are currently around 200 middle leaders on\u000a      the TL Fellows programme. They are regularly assessed by themselves and\u000a      peers against a competency framework to track their development. They are\u000a      also participating in a project with Perry and Clough to assess their\u000a      mental toughness throughout the period and they have received training to\u000a      enhance this mindset. Halfway through the project, one year in,\u000a      performance against the competencies has significantly improved in all\u000a      areas. Analysis conducted and presented by Perry show that this is\u000a      partially attributable to mental toughness.\u000a    From his work on mental toughness and the impact on education, Perry was\u000a      invited to give a day's training to the Oman Ministry of Higher Education\u000a      at London South Bank University in November 2013. Further, he has been\u000a      asked to conduct additional research regarding higher education in\u000a      partnership with City and Guilds in 2014 across several nations in the\u000a      middle east.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of International Centre for Mental Toughness Development\u000a      (ICMTD) research has primarily been on increasing the mental toughness of\u000a      young people and improving their attitudes to learning.

Of late, key developments in\u000a      research involving John Perry (Senior Lecturer, Leeds Trinity University,\u000a      2010 - present), have (a) established the validity of the MTQ48 model and\u000a      the questionnaire, (b) established the relationships between mental\u000a      toughness and performance and (c) established the relationships between\u000a      mental toughness and psychological health and wellbeing.\u000a    Clough, Earle and Sewell (2002) conceptualised mental toughness as the\u000a      quality that determines how people effectively deal with challenge,\u000a      stressors and pressure, irrespective of prevailing circumstances. In doing\u000a      so, they presented the 4Cs model; challenge, commitment, control, and\u000a      confidence, which was measurable through a questionnaire, the Mental\u000a      Toughness Questionnaire- 48 (MTQ48). This questionnaire is the most\u000a      widely-used assessment of mental toughness globally and in 2013, it is\u000a      expected to be used by 2,700 test centres in business, health, sport, and\u000a      education, across 86 countries. Despite its widespread use, the factorial\u000a      validity had not been rigorously examined. After questions were raised in\u000a      published literature, Clough, Earle, Perry and Crust (2012) defended the\u000a      validity of the MTQ48, citing support for its criterion validity, before\u000a      Perry, Clough, Crust, Earle and Nicholls (2012) presented robust support\u000a      for the factorial validity of the measure using a sample of 8207 and a\u000a      series of confirmatory factor analyses and exploratory structural equation\u000a      models. This large, heterogeneous sample was collected from subsamples in\u000a      senior management, lower and middle management, clerical\/administrative\u000a      staff, athletes, and students. Examining single-factor, four-factor, and\u000a      six-factor models, Perry et al. reported satisfactory model fit in all\u000a      samples. Further, with the exception of control of emotion, all subscales\u000a      yielded good reliability.\u000a    Working with collaborators at the University of Basel (Gerber et al,\u000a      2012) Perry has shown that mental toughness is linked to mental health.\u000a      The results showed that mental toughness mitigated against the\u000a      relationship between high stress and depression in adolescents. It is\u000a      argued that improving mental toughness may be an effective way of\u000a      enhancing mental health in groupings that are difficult to reach by more\u000a      typical health interventions.\u000a    Perry's role in this recent research has been primarily as a\u000a      psychometrics expert.

In the UK, \"Sporting\u000a        Playgrounds\" research has been promoted in reviews by Play England\u000a      and the National Children's Bureau that advocate the role of recess based\u000a      play in moving children towards the recommended accumulation levels for\u000a      physical activity (Sec.5, Source.Ai\/Aii). In the USA, The National\u000a      Association of Physical Education (Sec.5, Source.B) reported\u000a      evidence (Sec.2, Ref.2) within their position statement in the\u000a      drive to increase appropriate and novel opportunities for non-curricula\u000a      physical activity within schools. Active Living Research Briefs (2011,\u000a      2012; Sec.5, Source.Ci\/Cii) featured multiple exemplars of RISES \"Sporting\u000a        Playgrounds\" research within its \"key\" results that subsequently\u000a      informed policy statements within the USA (Sec.5, Source.Cii p.5).\u000a      To further demonstrate the geographic reach and significance of this\u000a      research, in 2008 `A Call for Action' was made to change legislation by\u000a      the Government of Western Australia via the Children's Physical Activity\u000a      Coalition (CPAC) Charter for Active Kids. Within this document RISES \"Sporting\u000a        Playgrounds\" research was highlighted when constructing the action\u000a      point to \"provide traditional and innovative playground markings in\u000a      schools to motivate participation in physical activity before school and\u000a      during breaks in classes\" (Sec.5, Source.D p.18-19).

RISES \"Sporting Playgrounds\" research (Sec.3, Ref.4)\u000a      are the only references cited from outside the USA and this has led to\u000a      policy recommendations (Sec.5, Source.E; 3 &amp; 4, p 185)\u000a      outlining the benefits of playground design for child development and\u000a      recess as a contributor to daily MVPA targets.\u000a    The Liverpool \"Sporting Playgrounds\" work was incorporated in to\u000a      the 2008 NICE Public Health Guidance 8. The NICE Environment and Physical\u000a      Activity group was reconvened in 2010 to discuss new research evidence and\u000a      update Public Health Guidance 8. The consensus was that RISES \"Sporting\u000a        Playgrounds\" research remained central to the \"environment\" guidance\u000a      produced in January 2008. Public Health Guidance 17 `Promoting Physical\u000a      Activity for Children and Young People', published in January 2009, was\u000a      chaired by Professor Gareth Stratton and promoted aspects of play for\u000a      families, including children's active play (Sec.5, Source.Fi\/Fii).\u000a    Locally, the \"Sporting Playgrounds\" project has informed the\u000a      School Improvement Policy of Liverpool City Council (Sec.5, Source G),\u000a      and impacted the redesign of school playgrounds in a region of the UK that\u000a      is exposed to significant health inequalities. Furthermore, the UK based\u000a      company Magical Markings was commissioned by the \"Sporting Playgrounds\"\u000a      project to implement the playground markings. The economic impact of this\u000a      research was reflected by the Director of Magical Markings (Sec.5\u000a        Source.H) who stated that \"the research at the Liverpool John\u000a        Moores University helped me to form integral parts of my business plan\u000a        and helped gain a `competitive edge' at a time, when at is most\u000a        prosperous, 47 employees were employed by the company working all over\u000a        the UK\".\u000a    The health impact of changing physical activity in this manner is\u000a      important, since it has recently been demonstrated that increasing VPA by\u000a      5 minutes per day reduces the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.\u000a      Health economics analysis of our RISES \"Sporting Playgrounds\" data\u000a      concluded that the cost of increasing playtime VPA by 5 minutes per day\u000a      was &#163;5.40 per child per year (Sec.5, Source.I).

This work was led by Professor Gareth\u000a      Stratton (LJMU: 1990-2011) and supported by Professor Stuart Fairclough\u000a      (2001-present) and Dr Nicola Ridgers (2003-2010). The overall project\u000a      assessed complex playground marking interventions within longitudinal\u000a      study designs and produced 9 peer-reviewed publications to 2013.\u000a    One of the first publications (Sec.3, Ref.1) used a novel approach\u000a      to change the physical playground environment in infant schools. By\u000a      painting the playground surface with multi-coloured markings, playtime\u000a      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and vigorous physical\u000a      activity (VPA) significantly increased by 10% and 6%, respectively.\u000a      Uniquely, the laboratory-based technique of indirect calorimetry was used\u000a      to generate heart rate and oxygen consumption regression curves for\u000a      individuals that allowed accurate quantification of energy expenditure\u000a      during play. Subsequently, a competitive grant from \"Health Promotion\u000a      Wales\" funded further exploration of the effects of painting\u000a      multi-coloured markings in school playgrounds on children's physical\u000a      activity. Again, multicolour playground markings significantly increased\u000a      children's MVPA and VPA by a similar amount (13.4% and 4.5%,\u000a      respectively). This research proposed that if these observed levels of\u000a      physical activity could be sustained, then multi-coloured playground\u000a      markings could make a valuable contribution to the attainment of\u000a      health-related physical activity recommendations in young people, thereby\u000a      leading to short and long-term health benefits (Sec.3, Ref.2).\u000a    In 2003 competitive grant funding was obtained from Sport England to\u000a      undertake a controlled trial of school playground design and markings on\u000a      children's physical activity. This was part of a &#163;12M intervention\u000a      project, involving 500 schools nationally, sponsored by Nike Inc. and\u000a      organised by the DfES. Thirty-four schools were recruited in Liverpool to\u000a      the \"Sporting Playgrounds\" project to assess both the initial and\u000a      long term effects of playground redesign on children's physical activity\u000a      and energy expenditure. In extending the work of Stratton and Mullan (Sec.3,\u000a        Ref.2), the next RISES study by Ridgers et al., (Sec.3, Ref.3)\u000a      re-designed playgrounds at fifteen intervention schools into three\u000a      specific colour-coded zones; ball games (red zone), less structured active\u000a      games, such as chase and tag (blue zone), and quiet activities, such as\u000a      socialising and inactive cooperative games (yellow zone). The project also\u000a      installed physical structures that included soccer goal posts, basketball\u000a      hoops, fencing and seating as well as ensuring manipulative sports\u000a      equipment such as soccer balls, skipping ropes and tennis balls were\u000a      provided to promote activity. A unique aspect of this study was the medium\u000a      and long-term follow-up measurements at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The\u000a      strongest positive effects of the playground redesign on MVPA and VPA were\u000a      observed after 6 months, and were still evident on VPA after 12 months.\u000a    Concomitant to these studies, peer review publications utilising heart\u000a      rate data, accelerometry indices (Sec.3, Ref. 3&amp;4), and a new\u000a      systematic observation tool (System for Observation of Children's Activity\u000a      Relationships during Play; Sec.3, Ref.5) assessed the modifiable\u000a      conditions (physical activity levels, social group sizes, activity type,\u000a      and social behaviour) that influence play behaviour and are needed to\u000a      design optimal playground-based physical activity interventions.\u000a      Techniques such as `draw and write' have also been used in recent\u000a      empirical work to provide rich representations of the playground\u000a      experiences of children and how these can be altered by novel playground\u000a      designs. More recent studies have also used multi-level modelling to allow\u000a      for changes in participants activity levels over time, as well as\u000a      adjusting data at individual and school levels. Overall these\u000a      methodologies have enabled the demonstration of sustained changes in\u000a      physical activity at 6 and 12 months post-intervention and therefore have\u000a      provided practitioners with greater confidence in altering the playground\u000a      environment.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31378","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Exposure to health risks linked to hypokinetic conditions is exacerbated\u000d\u000a      in north-west England where health inequalities are present.

The impact of research outcomes from\u000d\u000a      SportsLinx, and the resulting change in health programmes available for\u000d\u000a      children, are documented in the Liverpool Active City Strategy 2012-2017 (Sec.5,\u000a        Source.B). The significance and reach of the SportsLinx Project's\u000d\u000a      contribution to obesity prevention was recognised by the presentation of\u000d\u000a      the Louis Bonduelle Foundation Award from the European Childhood Obesity\u000d\u000a      Group in 2011. Furthermore, the local impact of SportsLinx-related\u000d\u000a      programmes, such as Active Play, is demonstrated by the fact that in\u000d\u000a      2009-10 alone there were 99,111 identified SportsLinx activity contacts\u000d\u000a      with children, through initiatives such as the Fitness Fun Day,\u000d\u000a      After-School Clubs, and Referral Schemes (Sec.5, Source.D).\u000d\u000a      Moreover, the Active Play resources developed by RISES in conjunction with\u000d\u000a      Liverpool City Council were commercialised and 300 were sold by Liverpool\u000d\u000a      City Council to local authorities elsewhere in the UK. To date sales have\u000d\u000a      totalled &#163;42,000 (Sec.5, Source.E), demonstrating both the\u000d\u000a      national relevance of the programme and economic benefit back to Liverpool\u000d\u000a      City Council.\u000d\u000a    RISES research provided physical activity and health data that directly\u000d\u000a      led to impact on childrens physical activity and health by the development\u000d\u000a      and implementation of new programmes and initiatives in Wigan Borough. The\u000d\u000a      PEPASS findings (Sec.3, Ref.4) were adopted as the evidence base\u000d\u000a      from which to develop borough-wide school and community initiatives that\u000d\u000a      addressed concerns about children's physical health. The relationships\u000d\u000a      between these research findings and proposed programmes were articulated\u000d\u000a      in the 2010 PEPASS Annual Report (Sec.5, Source.F), and the 2011\u000d\u000a      Wigan Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (Sec.5, Source.G). In the\u000d\u000a      former, direct reference was made to the research that the Council claimed\u000d\u000a      enabled it to be at the \"cutting edge of research and impact\u000d\u000a      identification\" which ensured that its actions and programmes were \"based\u000d\u000a      on robust evidence\". For the first time in Wigan, research evidence\u000d\u000a      identified important areas for intervention and this led directly to the\u000d\u000a      CHANGE! trial. The findings from CHANGE! demonstrated clinically\u000d\u000a      meaningful, positive changes in body size and physical activity in one\u000d\u000a      hundred 9-10 year old children (Sec.3, Ref.5). In the context of\u000d\u000a      Wigan Borough, a reduction in BMI z-scores is associated with reduced\u000d\u000a      cardio-metabolic risk at a local population level that will have an\u000d\u000a      immediate positive health impact that could extend into significant future\u000d\u000a      health benefits. These findings were disseminated to local Council\u000d\u000a      officials, and all Wigan primary school Head Teachers at a practitioner\u000d\u000a      conference and through a project report. Furthermore, an article in the\u000d\u000a      Wigan Evening Post (Sec.5, Source.H), which is distributed across\u000d\u000a      the 118 square mile area of Wigan borough, increased the reach of this\u000d\u000a      research-based impact by accessing the wider community and by raising\u000d\u000a      awareness of the health issues linking physical activity to obesity. Since\u000d\u000a      the end of the CHANGE! Wigan Council has decided to invest in a\u000d\u000a      Borough-wide teacher training program and roll-out of the project's\u000d\u000a      curriculum resource to all primary schools at the end of 2013 (Sec.5,\u000d\u000a        Source.I). Whilst the initial CHANGE! research involved over 300\u000d\u000a      children from 12 schools, the impact of a full borough program roll-out\u000d\u000a      would mean CHANGE! healthy lifestyle messages would reach, and impact\u000d\u000a      upon, the physical activity patterns and health status in approximately\u000d\u000a      3,300 children across 110 schools.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    High global and national prevalence levels of child obesity and physical\u000d\u000a      inactivity carry a substantially increased health risk.

Prevalence rates of child\u000d\u000a      overweight and obesity in Liverpool (14.9% and 23.1%, respectively) and\u000d\u000a      Wigan (16.2% and 19.5%, respectively) are higher than the national\u000d\u000a      average. Furthermore, high levels of physical inactivity are evident in\u000d\u000a      both authorities. In response to this, our progressive strategy was to\u000d\u000a      complete linked research studies beginning with unique, large scale\u000d\u000a      surveillance from which evidenced-based intervention programmes were\u000d\u000a      implemented. These studies have resulted in positive behaviour change and\u000d\u000a      health improvement.\u000d\u000a    RISES developed and led the Liverpool City-wide `SportsLinx' longitudinal\u000d\u000a      research project launched in 1996. SportsLinx has evolved into a range of\u000d\u000a      education-based physical activity and healthy eating initiatives in\u000d\u000a      Liverpool (e.g. Active Play). Research outputs from SportsLinx span 1998\u000d\u000a      to 2012 under the direction of Professor Gareth Stratton (1990-2011), Dr\u000d\u000a      Allan Hackett (until 2011), and Dr Lynne Boddy (2004-present). The\u000d\u000a      underpinning RISES research that describes Physical Education, Physical\u000d\u000a      Activity and School Sport (PEPASS) and Children's Health, Activity and\u000d\u000a      Nutrition: Get Educated (CHANGE!) spans 2009 to 2013. Professor Stuart\u000d\u000a      Fairclough (2001-present) conceived and led both projects with support\u000d\u000a      from Dr Lynne Boddy (2004-present).\u000d\u000a    Over 6000 children per year participate in the core SportsLinx Project\u000d\u000a      and the total database now includes 70,000 Liverpool children since 1996.\u000d\u000a      Specifically this work has highlighted the increase in prevalence of\u000d\u000a      overweight and obesity from ~25% in 1998 to ~36% in 2011 (Sec.3, Ref.1).\u000a      These data are significantly higher than the national average.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, relative to 1998 values this research demonstrated reductions\u000d\u000a      in aerobic fitness of up to 5.6% in boys and 8.1% in girls, independent of\u000d\u000a      weight and maturation status (Sec.3, Ref.2). Interestingly, the\u000d\u000a      most recent SportsLinx data were among the first to demonstrate a\u000d\u000a      plateauing of the year-on-year increase in the prevalence of child\u000d\u000a      obesity, although absolute levels are still very high.\u000d\u000a    The SportsLinx project highlighted a need for physical activity\u000d\u000a      interventions in young children, which directly resulted in the launch of\u000d\u000a      the family-focused Active Play pre-school intervention programme in 2009.\u000d\u000a      Two hundred and forty children from 77 Liverpool families were involved in\u000d\u000a      the Active Play intervention to promote physically active play in the\u000d\u000a      under 5s. Post-intervention, children engaged in 4.5% and 13.1% more daily\u000d\u000a      physical activity than control group children during the week and at\u000d\u000a      weekends, respectively (Sec.3, Ref.3).\u000d\u000a    Outcomes from the SportsLinx project also led directly to the development\u000d\u000a      of the PEPASS project in 2008. PEPASS was part funded by Wigan Council\u000d\u000a      between 2008 and 2010 during which time 550, 10-11 year olds participated\u000d\u000a      in the programme. In a sample of over 1000 Wigan schoolchildren physical\u000d\u000a      activity levels were demonstrated to be 20% lower than counterparts\u000d\u000a      elsewhere in England, and that prevalence of overweight and obesity was\u000d\u000a      ~4% higher than the England average (Sec.3, Ref.4). This research\u000d\u000a      provided a robust evidence base that identified important areas for\u000d\u000a      intervention. For example, children that had low activity levels during\u000d\u000a      discretionary physical activity segments of the day were specifically\u000d\u000a      targeted via structured afterschool physical activity programmes (Sec.\u000d\u000a        3, Ref.4). As a direct consequence of the PEPASS research the\u000d\u000a      CHANGE! physical activity and healthy eating clustered randomised trial\u000d\u000a      was commissioned and began in 2010 in 6 schools in partnership with Wigan\u000d\u000a      Council. This intervention resulted in significant reductions in waist\u000d\u000a      circumference (1.63 cm) and BMI z-score (-0.24), and a significant\u000d\u000a      increase in light intensity physical activity of 26 minutes per day.\u000d\u000a      Moreover, these effects were strongest among those children at greatest\u000d\u000a      risk of poor health status (e.g., girls, and overweight\/obese; Sec 3,\u000d\u000a        Ref.5).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31379","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    With the aim of linking research to impact, members of the CHS group have\u000a      engaged in strategic and high profile dissemination activity.

This now provides UK-specific data\u000a      related to the incidence and aetiology of sudden cardiac death in the\u000a      young in the UK which provides support for on-going developments in PPS,\u000a      diagnosis and treatment. This has also enhanced the quality of care for\u000a      families affected by a young sudden cardiac death by providing a\u000a      fast-track to specialist diagnostics.\u000a    A major impact of CHS research is that it has resulted in significant\u000a      changes to the decision making criteria\/algorithm[s] employed in PPS in\u000a      the UK, Europe and across the world through the production of consensus\u000a      statement documents (Sec.5, Source.B\/C). Consensus statements are a\u000a      standard method of changing practice and clinical decision marking and\u000a      have global reach. Advancements in practice include updated diagnostic\u000a      algorithms (i.e. ECG criteria) for cardiologists and clinical\u000a      scientists and include CHS work on long QT syndrome (Sec.3, Ref.2).\u000a      These data were adopted in the European Cardiology Society consensus\u000a      statement for ECG interpretation in athletes (Sec.5, Source.B) as\u000a      well as the consequent inclusion in the recent Seattle Criteria (Sec.5,\u000a        Source.C) for PPS. These consensus guidelines, including the work\u000a      produced by the CHS, have become the cornerstone of PPS globally and have\u000a      been adopted by influential sports governing bodies (e.g. IOC, FIFA, Union\u000a      International du Cycling).\u000a    Research from the CHS have helped to characterise the structural and\u000a      functional phenotype of the athlete's heart (Sec.3, Ref.3-5) and\u000a      these represent the current `gold standard' in relation to upper normal\u000a      physiologic limits of cardiac adaptation, across gender and ethnicity for\u000a      all sporting populations. These data, and other CHS publications, have\u000a      directly contributed to bespoke educational material and practice\u000a      guidelines for PPS in the UK. Specifically, two \"Guideline\" documents have\u000a      been produced by the British Society of Echocardiography and endorsed by\u000a      the charity CRY (Sec.5, Source.D\/E) and have now changed the PPS of\u000a      athletes in the UK. To date these guidelines have been disseminated to\u000a      over 4000 UK and international members of the British Society of\u000a      Echocardiography and systematically enhanced service delivery in all\u000a      clinical echocardiography departments in the UK (Sec.5, Source.F).\u000a    CHS staff, in association with CRY, launched a \"CRY Cardiovascular\u000a      Screening Centre\" at LJMU opened by the then Secretary of State Rt. Hon\u000a      Andrew Burnham in 2009. This centre has provided a direct access service\u000a      for young people and athletes in the local community and since its\u000a      establishment has provided cardiac sports screening to over 200 young\u000a      people (Sec.5, Source.A). The CHS group, in collaboration with\u000a      clinical colleagues, have extended this service to elite athlete groups.\u000a      Specifically, this has led to a comprehensive PPS programme for Liverpool\u000a      FC (2010-present). To date we have completed PPS in over 500 young\u000a      athletes, with approximately 10% being referred on for further\u000a      investigation and monitoring and one professional athlete has been removed\u000a      from competitive sport due to the detection of cardiovascular pathology\u000a      and increased risk for sudden cardiac death (Sec.5, Source.G). The\u000a      translation of CHS research and development of a large scale PPS program\u000a      has also occurred within the National Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic\u000a      Hospital (ASPETAR), Doha, Qatar (Qatar National Pre-participation\u000a      Screening Programme launched in 2009). This programme has now screened\u000a      6730 athletes with 12 cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy detected (11\u000a      athletes disqualified from competition) as well as 22 other pathological\u000a      conditions resulting in disqualification or on-going monitoring. This\u000a      process has also provided new normative data for ECG and echocardiographic\u000a      parameters in Arabic\/Asian athletes to further feedback into diagnostic\u000a      criteria and treatment planning (Sec.5, Corr.H).\u000a    The provision of improved evidence-based guidelines for PPS has changed\u000a      policy and PPS implementation in the UK and globally. The Chair of the IOC\u000a      Medical Commission has stated (2013) \"The CHS group's on-going\u000a        research, leading to the continual enhancement of screening guidelines,\u000a        has improved sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and resulted in an\u000a        improved quality of care for athletes across the globe\" (Sec.5,\u000a        Source.I).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    There are twelve young (&lt;35 years) sudden cardiac deaths each week in\u000a      the UK. These deaths in the young, fit and otherwise healthy are\u000a      devastating, result in significant life-years lost and can lead to\u000a      substantial media attention. The focus of this case study is based on the\u000a      fact that the majority of these deaths may be preventable as it is\u000a      possible to detect young athletes at risk of sudden cardiac death through\u000a      pre-participation cardiovascular screening (PPS).

This work has been\u000a      undertaken by the following staff; Professor Greg Whyte (GW;\u000a      2006-present), Professor Keith George (KG; 2002-present), Professor Tim\u000a      Cable (TC; 1993-present), Professor Daniel Green (DG; 2006-present) and\u000a      Reader Dr David Oxborough (DO; 2012-present) in conjunction with multiple\u000a      collaborators within the UK and around the globe.\u000a    The CHS group, in collaboration with the National Centre of Excellence\u000a      for Cardiac Pathology, located at St. George's Hospital, published the\u000a      first UK study to systematically examine the aetiology of sudden cardiac\u000a      death in 118 young sudden cardiac death victims (Sec.2, Ref.1).\u000a      The results of this study confirmed the importance of cardiomyopathies in\u000a      the aetiology of sudden cardiac deaths in young athletes in the UK. This\u000a      work also highlighted that the hearts of these victims were often\u000a      morphologically normal, a finding that has two consequences; 1) this\u000a      implicates the importance of electrical disorders (e.g.\u000a      ionchannelopathies) in the incidence of sudden cardiac death in this\u000a      cohort, and 2) it reinforces the issue that there is substantial\u000a      phenotypical overlap (the \"Grey Zone\") between pathology and physiological\u000a      adaptation that requires careful evidence-based PPS protocols and\u000a      criteria.\u000a    In developing sustained links with sports governing bodies, charities and\u000a      clinical groups, the CHS has published novel empirical work related to the\u000a      upper normal limits of the athletic heart phenotype. This has been\u000a      undertaken in association with the key investigative tools associated with\u000a      PPS, namely ECG and echocardiography. For example, the CRG has published a\u000a      series of papers examining the ECG in large cohorts of elite athletes.\u000a      These papers included the largest studies of their kind examining in\u000a      excess of 2,000 elite athletes including unique data across gender and\u000a      ethnicity (Sec.3, Ref.2), that specifically reported a 0.4%\u000a      prevalence of long-QT syndrome and established new upper limits for QT\u000a      interval in elite athletes of 500 ms.\u000a    In addition, the CHS group has published a series of studies describing\u000a      the upper normal (physiological) limits for the morphological\u000a      characteristics of the left ventricle, right ventricle and left atrium in\u000a      a range of elite athletic populations (Sec.3, Ref.3-5).\u000a      Specifically, data (Sec.3, Ref.3) in a large group of elite\u000a      endurance athletes provided upper normal limits for right ventricular size\u000a      demonstrating unique right ventricular enlargement that is different to\u000a      that observed in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy that has\u000a      been implicated in a significant number of athletic sudden cardiac deaths\u000a      in the UK and globally. Uniquely, this paper also described novel indices\u000a      of regional and global right ventricular function as well as assessing the\u000a      impact of cardiac size upon function. This work provides supporting\u000a      evidence for the application of novel echocardiographic indices in PPS\u000a      allowing further improvement in the differentiation of physiological\u000a      versus pathological adaptation. The impact of ethnicity on sudden cardiac\u000a      death data has been noted globally. Characterisation of the effect of\u000a      ethnicity on the athlete's heart, however, was required to improve PPS.\u000a      The CHS were the first to publish, with key collaborators, comparative\u000a      echocardiographic data in Caucasian, Afro-Caribbean and West-Asian\u000a      athletes including gender comparisons. For example, we published the first\u000a      data characterising cardiac morphology in a large sample of elite black\u000a      athletes in comparison with elite Caucasian athletes (Sec.3, Ref.4).\u000a      The key outcome was the significantly higher prevalence of black athletes\u000a      (18% vs. 4%) presenting with left ventricular wall thickness above the\u000a      normal upper limit (&gt;12 mm). Furthermore, 3% of black athletes\u000a      exhibited left ventricular wall thickness above the accepted elite athlete\u000a      upper normal limit for white athletes (&gt;15 mm), that would trigger\u000a      further investigation. In a follow-up study (Sec.3, Ref.5) we\u000a      highlighted similar right ventricular adaptations across ethnic groups\u000a      which serves as valuable information for PPS when ECG findings are more\u000a      likely to be `abnormal' in athletes of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31955","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    An agreed outcome of this England Golf-funded research [3b] was the\u000a      production of a technical report [3a] that was provided to key decision-\u000a      and policy-makers within the organisation. The technical report's findings\u000a      and recommendations were discussed in significant depth within England\u000a      Golf, including at the top level at senior executive meetings. This led,\u000a      in the final quarter of 2011, to dissemination down through the\u000a      organisation via discussions with the regional development officers and\u000a      the county development officer network. To address and impart the research\u000a      findings within and throughout practice and policy, at the end of 2011 a\u000a      working group was set up by England Golf to revise the GolfMark scheme.\u000a      This research was highly influential in leading and shaping the revisions\u000a      made to the existing GolfMark scheme [5b].\u000a    With respect to the widening participation and improving GolfMark\u000a      research, recommendations made to England Golf that were adopted are\u000a      grouped under membership and GolfMark, as follows [see Whole Sport Plan\u000a      2013-2107: 5c]:\u000a    Membership recommendations adopted\u000a    1) Offer greater range of memberships facilitating more short-term,\u000a      student, junior and part- time engagement.\u000a    2) Promote female-friendly environments.\u000a    3) Appoint individuals from minority groups to prominent decision-making\u000a      positions.\u000a    4) Re-evaluate membership selection processes and dress codes.\u000a    GolfMark recommendations adopted\u000a    5) Highlight long-term economic impact of GolfMark among clubs.\u000a    6) Reduce the complexity of the application process.\u000a    7) Require clubs to provide more effective infrastructures for the\u000a      provision of coaching among target groups.\u000a    The revised GolfMark scheme was piloted in fourteen clubs across the\u000a      country during 2012, and the success of this has led to GolfMark having a\u000a      much greater focus upon clubs' overall business in relation to aspects\u000a      including operations, development and marketing. The new GolfMark was then\u000a      re-launched nationally in 2013, and is an integral aspect linked to one of\u000a      four key performance indicators within England Golf's proposed Whole Sport\u000a      Plan for the period 2013-2017 [5b-c].\u000a    One specific example of the impact derives from the finding from the\u000a      research that the barriers to engaging in GolfMark included some clubs'\u000a      inability to embrace and modernise in accordance with the scheme's\u000a      objectives. To educate and guide clubs and individuals, in addition to the\u000a      processes of accreditation and maintenance of good effective practice, the\u000a      revised GolfMark now supports them through an online signposting and\u000a      resource system, assisting them to both achieve and then maintain GolfMark\u000a      status [5d].\u000a    There are a number of direct beneficiaries from the impact of and changes\u000a      derived from this research, including:\u000a    1) The national governing body, England Golf, has implemented change\u000a      based on recommendations to reduce the decline in participation rates and\u000a      to widen participation. This has broader implications for addressing\u000a      participation rate objectives regarding the whole community, and young\u000a      people specifically, as set by Sport England. A potentially even wider\u000a      benefit is that this may contribute to Department of Health objectives\u000a      related to increasing physical activity participation amongst the national\u000a      population. Hence, the beneficiaries are not only England Golf, but also\u000a      other bodies including Sport England and the Department of Health.\u000a    2) The increased and wider participation addresses inequality issues, and\u000a      the increased activity and income will provide clubs with greater power to\u000a      direct their future development. Hence, direct beneficiaries include clubs\u000a      throughout England and their members, particularly those that embrace,\u000a      implement and attempt to gain from the revised GolfMark scheme.\u000a    It is considered by England Golf [5a-b] that the impact and value of this\u000a      research has improved the GolfMark scheme, and will consequently benefit\u000a      government, and many stakeholders of golf, including golf's governing\u000a      bodies, clubs, members, and professional coaches, as well as wider\u000a      communities, such as children\/young people. It is anticipated that the\u000a      recent changes in policy and strategies implemented based on this research\u000a      will lead to increased and wider participation in golf, and over the next\u000a      few years data will become available to demonstrate the effectiveness of\u000a      these changes. These data will be tracked and analysed to further assess\u000a      the long term impact of the research findings.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Comprehensive recommendations from research into barriers to\u000a      participation in golf were adopted by a National Governing Body (NGB) of\u000a      sport, England Golf, to inform their Whole Sport Plan (2013-17).

For\u000a      example, the awareness that the barriers to engaging in GolfMark included\u000a      a club's perceived inability to change and individuals' lack of knowledge,\u000a      led to the development of an online signposting and resource system to\u000a      guide and support clubs in achieving GolfMark status.

In addition to this trend,\u000a      a skewed participation demographic pattern towards older, white males in\u000a      higher socio-economic groups continues to exist, despite evidence\u000a      revealing that more young people and those from lower socio-economic\u000a      groups are becoming involved in golf (Sport England, 2011).\u000a    The demographic make-up of golf is effectively exclusionary, contravening\u000a      Sport England's terms of reference regarding `creating sporting\u000a      opportunities in every community'. The decline in participation also\u000a      impacts on Sport England's aims of having `25% fewer 16-18 year olds\u000a      dropping out of five sports', and has implications for wider government\u000a      physical activity for health initiatives. Addressing this exclusionary\u000a      demographic and increasing participation rates therefore assists not only\u000a      England Golf, but also contributes to wider government Health of the\u000a      Nation objectives.\u000a    Research\u000a    England Golf's response to addressing these specific problems is\u000a      GolfMark, an innovative scheme aimed at rewarding clubs for promoting\u000a      beginner- and junior-friendly environments through coaching provision and\u000a      the implementation of child protection and equality policies. Prior to\u000a      this research, no evidence existed on the impact of such a scheme on the\u000a      culture of clubs, or the extent to which they facilitate changes to the\u000a      breadth and quality of participation.\u000a    Framed around the goal of understanding and evaluating golf participation\u000a      in the England, the research was focused on three main questions:\u000a    1) What are the historical-cultural forces that have led to low\u000a      participation in golf among women, young people, minority ethnic groups\u000a      and working classes?\u000a    2) What impact was GolfMark having in terms of widening participation in\u000a      golf clubs?\u000a    3) What barriers remained to the successful implementation of GolfMark?\u000a    Question 1 sought to provide new insights by conducting a systematic\u000a      review of barriers to participation in, and social exclusions from, sport\u000a      (especially golf) [3a,c]. Question 2 was addressed through a survey of 24\u000a      club representatives, 134 members and 92 nomadic\/non- members across\u000a      England [3a-d]. Part of the analysis included a two-step cluster analysis,\u000a      from which three types of clubs emerged, categorised broadly as\u000a      `exclusive-family',' typical' and `cheap- male' types [3a]. Question 3 was\u000a      addressed through in-depth case studies at three clubs, each\u000a      representative of the three types identified, and these were located in\u000a      order to take into consideration geographical influences [3a,c,e].\u000a    The key research report underpinning this case study is the Technical\u000a      Report [3a], which provided an extensive and comprehensive report of the\u000a      research into the historical-cultural, GolfMark, and other barriers\u000a      affecting the widening of participation in golf in England. This research\u000a      has also led to the development of additional research outputs on this\u000a      topic [3c-e], and further research on verifying and understanding the\u000a      causes of changes in participation arising from the impact of this\u000a      research will be conducted.\u000a    Key findings\u000a    With respect to the three main questions, the outcomes were that:\u000a    1) The most important determinant of participation was socio-economic\u000a      status, as traditionally powerful groups (i.e., white, middle-class men)\u000a      maintain `class homogeneity', especially through decision-making positions\u000a      such as club secretary.\u000a    2) Club secretaries and managers agreed that GolfMark had its greatest\u000a      impact on them in relation to `gaining funding' and `creating links with\u000a      schools'. Only 30.6% of members were aware of GolfMark, and 76.1% did not\u000a      know whether their club had GolfMark. Most believed that issues addressed\u000a      by GolfMark were important, especially in the creation of junior- and\u000a      beginner-friendly environments.\u000a    3) Clubs that maintain traditional structures reinforce socially\u000a      exclusive cultural conventions, employ key positional personnel who\u000a      actively resist change, and are less likely to progress with GolfMark.\u000a      Rich, exclusive clubs are insulated from economic forces that are driving\u000a      change in smaller clubs, which must adapt or perish.\u000a    Who and when conducted\u000a      The research was conducted from February 2010 to July 2011. The lead\u000a      researcher was Dr David Piggott, and the co-researchers were Gary Leslie\u000a      and Greg Poller (both MSc by Research students).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31956","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A number of impact outcomes have been identified by the client as arising\u000a      as a direct result of the research.

These posts co-ordinate the programme for the reduction in\u000a        obesity through physical activity, healthier eating and emotional\u000a        well-being across the lifecycle. Their purpose was to `embed skills or\u000a        tools into local areas, run by local volunteers or community people'\u000a        (research report, page 16).\u000a      \u000aPartnership development: there was a reconfiguration of\u000a        the partnership arrangements used to tackle obesity, which also led to\u000a        the employment of a further staff member dedicated to the co-ordination\u000a        of partnership roles and to work specifically on childhood obesity\u000a        prevention.\u000a    \u000a    ii) Strategy\u000a    \u000a      \u000aLocal obesity strategies were developed, specific to\u000a        local requirements.\u000a      A `Healthy Weight' care pathway was established for 0\u000a        to 18 year olds in North-East Lincolnshire.\u000a      A new communications strategy for the obesity programme\u000a        was created, including the use of electronic media, to improve\u000a        communications at all levels of the programme.\u000a      \u000aHealthy eating opportunities: a new Healthy Choices\u000a        Award Scheme was introduced to enable and encourage food retailers to\u000a        offer healthier choices.\u000a      The introduction and implementation of a monitoring tool\u000a        took place to enhance ongoing evaluation of the strategy.\u000a    \u000a    iii) Training and resources\u000a    \u000a      \u000aTraining: between 2009 and 2011 a skills package was\u000a        introduced for health professionals that comprised of four new\u000a        certificated courses and a series of guides that were produced for\u000a        health trainers.\u000a      \u000aResource allocations to the obesity project were\u000a        enhanced, including the production of leaflets for both health workers\u000a        and clients, as well as the retention of resources that would otherwise\u000a        have been lost, for example, by establishing a library of advisory\u000a        documents.\u000a      In respect of health-worker behaviour change, workers\u000a        were trained in the wider understanding of the social and environmental\u000a        contexts of obesity, as well as lifecycle influences, to improve\u000a        efficacy of the obesity programme.\u000a    \u000a    The Care Trust also considers that the research has had a beneficial\u000a      impact on obesity levels in North-East Lincolnshire, and research is\u000a      currently underway to investigate this further.\u000a    How the research led to impact\u000a    The research was commissioned specifically due to the considerable\u000a      challenge of tackling the obesity `epidemic' in the North-East\u000a      Lincolnshire area, and the research technical report was provided directly\u000a      to key decision-makers in the Care Trust in 2009. It was also distributed\u000a      to a wide range of stakeholder groups accessing and using the Obesity\u000a      Prevention Strategy. Wider dissemination and impact, beyond the North-East\u000a      Lincolnshire region, has been achieved through academic journal articles\u000a      and conference presentations, and this is also ongoing.\u000a    Nature, extent and dates of the impact\u000a    The changes noted above were implemented from 2010. The project has also\u000a      stimulated local and regional debate relating to strategy monitoring,\u000a      collaborative service alliances, and marketing communication strategies,\u000a      which in turn led to further funding from North-East Lincolnshire Care\u000a      Trust allocated to the HART group to conduct additional research. These\u000a      subsequent projects have included investigating the changes made as a\u000a      consequence of the research (currently ongoing), as well as further grants\u000a      to research other related strategies, such as the Food for Fitness Team\u000a      and Health Promotion Portfolio in North-East Lincolnshire. In relation to\u000a      local and regional impact, the research has generated a strong working\u000a      relationship between the research team and the key regional agencies,\u000a      resulting in the team's input into strategic thinking in relation not only\u000a      to obesity programmes, but also to health promotion more generally in the\u000a      region.\u000a    The scope of the research is potentially international (with regard to\u000a      its relevance to obesity reduction strategies) as well as national, and\u000a      the School intends to develop this aspect in future work.

The\u000a      semi-structured focus groups and interviews established an in-depth\u000a      understanding of the experiences and opinions of those directly involved\u000a      with implementation of the strategy. Purposive sampling, supplemented by\u000a      snowball sampling via health professionals, was used to draw up a sample\u000a      for the focus groups and interviews comprising: 1) community participants\u000a      (intervention beneficiaries), and, 2) health professionals and local\u000a      stakeholders (at strategic and senior level). Focus groups and interviews\u000a      explored attitudes toward and experiences of both the delivery and\u000a      the receipt of the strategy. Thematic data analysis was used to\u000a      identify salient themes cohering around: 1) the implementation of the\u000a      strategy, and, 2) impact on the intended beneficiaries.\u000a    Principal findings\u000a    \u000a      There was a need for an expanded staffing base for the successful\u000a        delivery of the programme.\u000a      Open College Network Level 1 accredited training was required for\u000a        health workers in areas relating to healthy lifestyles.\u000a      There was a need to protect and enhance resources in this area of\u000a        work.\u000a      Specific recommendations were made in regard to enhancing partnership\u000a        working amongst a range of health stakeholders.\u000a      Health workers needed to accommodate more fully the social and\u000a        environmental contexts of obesity.\u000a      A new communications strategy would be beneficial.\u000a      Opportunities for healthier eating should be developed.\u000a    \u000a    Outputs\u000a    Findings were disseminated in various fora: a comprehensive research\u000a      report was produced for the client; an international conference\u000a      presentation was delivered, and international, peer-reviewed journal\u000a      articles were produced.\u000a    Who and when conducted\u000a    The research was conducted from June 2009 to March 2010 by members of\u000a      HART: Geoff Middleton (lead researcher), Hannah Henderson (n&#233;e Rigby), and\u000a      Donna Evans (co-researchers), all of whom were early career researchers at\u000a      the time.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32232","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of our research stems from its far reaching contribution to\u000a      the professional development, training and support services provided by\u000a      both sports coaches and sport science practitioners. In the sections that\u000a      follow, numbers in superscript refer to particular sources to corroborate\u000a      the impact (in section 5).\u000a    The influence of Hardy L on policy, service delivery, and the development\u000a      and provision of sport psychology support services (through for example,\u000a      his involvement with the British Olympic Association, UK Sport and the\u000a      England and Wales Cricket Board) has extended well beyond the UK1.\u000a      Indeed, his research has been and continues to be among the most\u000a        influential in the provision of sport psychology support to athletes and\u000a        coaches1. For instance, originally conceived when he\u000a      worked with Richard Butler (co-author) during his tenure as Chair of the\u000a      British Olympic Association's Psychology Steering Group and Head\u000a      Psychologist (1989-2001), performance profiling is generally acknowledged\u000a      to be a model of best practice for the development of optimal\u000a        performance and widely employed by practitioners 1, 2, 10.\u000a      The significance of Hardy L's impact on sport psychology provision is,\u000a      however, best evidenced by the influence that Hardy L, Jones G and Gould\u000a      (1996) has on the current thinking and professional practice of sport\u000a      psychologists and coaches almost 20 years after its publication 1,\u000a        6, 10.\u000a    In relation to professional service delivery, research into coaching and\u000a      reflective practice has also informed the development and training of\u000a      sports coaches and sport science practitioners. To illustrate, at the\u000a      request of the Welsh Football Trust, Cropley recently co-developed the\u000a      Youth `A' Coaching Licence, the first qualification of its kind in the\u000a        world. The content of the licence is based on research into\u000a      reflective practice, performance profiling and goal-setting from IRESE\u000a      researchers. The first cohort of coaches began the course in June, 2013\u000a      and the programme will run annually with approximately 20 candidates per\u000a      course2. The importance of Cropley's research for coach\u000a      development is such that he was invited by the Welsh Football Trust to\u000a      give a keynote presentation at their national conference (2013), and in\u000a      association with a Knowledge, Economy, Skills Scholarships Project,\u000a      received funding for a PhD (&#163;72,000) into the development of Level 1 and 2\u000a      coaching qualifications (2011)2.\u000a    In terms of influencing policy at a UK level, Cropley was invited to\u000a      provide a position statement for Sports Coach UK (SCUK) on the utility of\u000a      reflective practice for sports coaches as the basis for integrating\u000a      reflective practice into all UK sports coach education programmes (&#163;5,000\u000a      enterprise grant awarded, 2011) 7. Both he and Jones R were\u000a      also invited members of a panel of experts consulted by SCUK about how\u000a      `coaching excellence' could be better developed in the UK (2012) 8.\u000a      Also at a UK level, Cropley (in conjunction with Knowles at Liverpool John\u000a      Moores University) co-wrote a core supervised experience reflective\u000a      practice workshop for the British Association of Sport and Exercise\u000a      Sciences (BASES) 3, which is compulsory for all trainee\u000a        sport and exercise scientists pursuing BASES accreditation to work\u000a        professionally in the UK sport industry. The workshop, delivered by\u000a      Cropley has been running since 2010 and attended by some 120 candidates 3.\u000a      It has also been run as part of the BASES Continuing Professional\u000a      Development programme for Accredited Practitioners (2010) 3.\u000a      Internationally, research by Jones R has underpinned national\u000a        initiatives such as that of Sport New Zealand to grow leadership\u000a        potential in young people by helping to better prepare them to coach\u000a      9.\u000a    Further evidence of research impact can be found in the development\u000a        of new National Governing Body coach education programmes and in changes\u000a        to existing ones. For example, in relation to the former, Jones's\u000a      research into re-conceptualising the nature of coaching has been central\u000a        to the development of a new coach education programme offered by the\u000a      Gaelic Athletic Association 4, the largest sporting body in\u000a      Ireland. In addition, based on their earlier coach education work, Callow\u000a      and Roberts' current Sport Wales funded project has led to the upskilling\u000a        of more elite sport coaches in the UK 5. Although this\u000a      work is yet to be completed, the nature of the intervention and evaluation\u000a      has attracted considerable interest from other UK sporting agencies. For\u000a      example, in 2012, Callow and Roberts were consulted by UK Sport in\u000a      relation to best practice for the evaluation of their education\u000a      programmes.\u000a    In relation to the development of existing coach education programmes,\u000a      examples of the content of the programmes being underpinned by research\u000a      conducted at Bangor and Cardiff Met include the Rugby Football Union (RFU)\u000a      Level 4, British Gymnastics Level 3 and the UKCC Level 2 Paddle-Sport\u000a      courses 10. The RFU and Paddle-Sport courses include aspects\u000a      of performance profiling, goal setting and imagery, all of which are\u000a      underpinned by research from Bangor and Cardiff (Callow, Hardy L, Kingston\u000a      and Roberts) and the British Gymnastics course provides further evidence\u000a      of the impact of Jones's research on coaching practice 10.\u000a      Since 2008 more than 1600 coaches have completed the Paddle-Sport course\u000a      and 50 the RFU Level 4 coaching award.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 1993, research in service delivery and performance psychology from\u000a      the constituent groups of the Institute for Research Excellence in Sport\u000a      and Exercise (IRESE) at Bangor University and Cardiff Metropolitan\u000a      University has underpinned the content and provision of professional\u000a      training and development programmes in the UK and more globally.\u000a      Specifically, since 2008 the research has informed the development and\u000a      delivery of existing governing body coach education programmes and\u000a        coach education programmes that are among the first of their kind\u000a        anywhere in the world.

This body of work has been\u000a      disseminated via high quality peer-reviewed publications, evidences\u000a      methodological rigour, and has been the focus of empirical scrutiny and\u000a      debate.\u000a    Amongst the early research, the work by Hardy L [1] propagating models of\u000a      consultancy and performance profiling was instrumental in promoting a\u000a        model of equal expertise between clients and practitioners as an\u000a      approach to best practice for service delivery. Subsequent research into\u000a      the relative efficacy of various psychological skills proposed to aid\u000a      performance (e.g., goal setting, imagery) has helped shape the effective\u000a      use of these strategies across various performance contexts. For example,\u000a      Kingston and Hardy L provided the first evidence for the beneficial\u000a        effects of setting process goals on psychological constructs such as\u000a        anxiety and confidence, as well as on performance [2]. Meanwhile,\u000a      research conducted by Callow and Hardy L has advanced knowledge and\u000a      understanding of effective imagery use and demonstrated the benefits of novel\u000a        approaches to using mental imagery [3].\u000a    More recently, research by Cropley and Hanton has been a catalyst for the\u000a      use of reflective practice by professional practitioners. Although\u000a      reflective practice has long been advocated, a lack of knowledge and\u000a      understanding had hindered its use. Cropley's research [4] has helped to\u000a      redress this situation by demonstrating that reflective practice\u000a      facilitates the development of a range of characteristics associated with\u000a      effective sport psychology support. Also in relation to service delivery,\u000a      work by Jones R [5] has redefined the nature of coaching and the\u000a      subsequent role of coaches within it by depicting coaching as a\u000a      flexible process, dependent on the complexities of inter- and\u000a      intra-personal interactions and the social contexts within which they\u000a      occur. This view of coaching offers coaches a better understanding of\u000a        the reality and practice of coaching and contrasts with a\u000a      traditional rationalistic one where coaching is seen as a more ordered and\u000a      linear process, and wherein the role of coaches is largely to transfer\u000a      information [5].\u000a    The strands of service delivery and performance psychology have since\u000a      been drawn together by Callow and Roberts to underpin the development of\u000a      intervention programmes aimed at increasing coaches' use of psychological\u000a      skills with their athletes [6]. Funded by Sport Wales, this research\u000a      demonstrated that the commonly used workshop-based approaches to coach\u000a      education are ineffective and that an individualised needs-based approach\u000a      incorporating performance profiling and reflective practice increases\u000a        both understanding of psychological skills and coach confidence to teach\u000a        them. As a result of this work they received further funding from\u000a      Sport Wales for a five-year research programme (2009-2014) to: (i) further\u000a      develop their unique intervention with a view to informing future coach\u000a        education programmes, (ii) reach a greater number of elite sport\u000a      coaches in the UK, and (iii) evaluate the processes underlying\u000a      intervention effects. This evaluation research is an original contribution\u000a      to both sport psychology and coaching.\u000a    The underpinning research reflects an even contribution from Bangor\u000a      University and Cardiff Met.

From 2008, it\u000d\u000a      benefitted the organisation, and all recruits, as evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      specific impacts that follow.\u000d\u000a      Numbers in superscript refer to particular sources to corroborate the\u000d\u000a      impact (in section 5).\u000d\u000a    In 2008, informed by the above research, the Army Recruiting and Training\u000d\u000a      Division (ARTD)\u000d\u000a      established the Army Staff Leadership School (ASLS) with the remit of\u000d\u000a      training all non-commissioned\u000d\u000a      officers that received training postings in transformational leadership\u000d\u000a      and coaching\u000d\u000a      skills. The British Army uses non-commissioned officers to train\u000d\u000a      approximately 10,000 new recruits\u000d\u000a      each year. These non-commissioned officers are trained to deliver that\u000d\u000a      training by ASLS. All Army\u000d\u000a      trainers get posted back into active service after two years.

This research [3]\u000d\u000a      confirmed the Royal Marines' findings and also showed some regimental\u000d\u000a      differences in key\u000d\u000a      leadership variables (for instance, an appropriate role model was more\u000d\u000a      important for Guards\u000d\u000a      Regiments, whilst inspirational motivation was more important for the\u000d\u000a      Parachute Regiment).\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the research demonstrated that training recruit trainers to\u000d\u000a      use transformational\u000d\u000a      leadership and coaching skills could bring about long term change within\u000d\u000a      the organisation that was\u000d\u000a      sustainable beyond the period of the trainers' postings [3, 7].\u000d\u000a    As a result of this second success, Hardy L and Arthur were invited to\u000d\u000a      conduct similar research at\u000d\u000a      the Infantry Battle School, Brecon, where all non-commissioned officers\u000d\u000a      receive their training prior\u000d\u000a      to promotion [4], and at the Initial Training Group, where recruits for\u000d\u000a      non-Infantry Regiments (e.g.,\u000d\u000a      Tank, Artillery, Engineers) receive their initial training [5]. This\u000d\u000a      research confirmed the\u000d\u000a      generalisability of the previous findings.\u000d\u000a    In summary, this ten year programme of research demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      training the non-commissioned\u000d\u000a      officers who deliver training in transformational leadership and coaching\u000d\u000a      skills\u000d\u000a      reduces wastage in training, and enhances the soldier-in-training's\u000d\u000a      performance and mental health.\u000d\u000a      These findings were confirmed across different arms of the British\u000d\u000a      military services, different\u000d\u000a      training establishments and at different levels of training. The Bangor\u000d\u000a        model of transformational\u000d\u000a        leadership focuses upon providing an inspirational vision of what\u000d\u000a      training will lead to, helping\u000d\u000a      trainees to understand the challenges that must be overcome, and providing\u000d\u000a      individualised support\u000d\u000a      to help them overcome those challenges. The coaching skills utilised by\u000d\u000a      the model are: developing\u000d\u000a      a coaching relationship; setting appropriate goals, giving and receiving\u000d\u000a      feedback, and asking\u000d\u000a      questions that help soldiers-in-training to find their own solutions.\u000d\u000a    A feature of this research was that the researchers worked with a team of\u000d\u000a      \"key influencers\"\u000d\u000a      (typically, one commissioned officer between two and five warrant\u000d\u000a      officers) from within the\u000d\u000a      organisation. This ensured a legacy was left within the organisation after\u000d\u000a      the research had been\u000d\u000a      completed. These teams were coached to design and deliver bespoke\u000d\u000a      leadership and coaching\u000d\u000a      interventions to trainers within their organisation. The teams sat outside\u000d\u000a      the normal Chain of\u000d\u000a      Command (something of a precedent in the Armed Services) so that recruit\u000d\u000a      trainers could receive\u000d\u000a      additional coaching without jeopardising their annual reports and\u000d\u000a      promotion prospects.\u000d\u000a    The key researchers involved in this research are Hardy L\u000d\u000a      (appointed in 1978 now a Professor)\u000d\u000a      and Arthur (appointed as a research assistant in 2004 and then as\u000d\u000a      a Lecturer in 2009) who left in\u000d\u000a      December 2012.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32320","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of our research can be traced directly to the policy decisions\u000a      about the two key policy\u000a      imperatives of the Climbing Higher strategy. Evidence of the\u000a      impact is provided below. Numbers in\u000a      superscript refer to particular sources to corroborate the impact (in\u000a      section 5).\u000a    Public policy linked to sport and physical activity in Wales was\u000a      addressed explicitly in the Welsh\u000a      Government's first national strategy, Climbing Higher. Research\u000a      conducted at Cardiff Met has\u000a      informed policy decisions, influenced changes to the capture and\u000a        management of data\u000a        linked to physical activity provision, and altered the nature of that\u000a        provision for the\u000a        engagement of two particular age groups (60+ and 16 and under) &#8212;\u000a      together, 45% of the\u000a      Welsh population in 2012. Indirectly, it has also reduced public spending\u000a      on less effective\u000a      alternative provision and enhanced the health and well-being of these\u000a      segments of the population.\u000a      The main beneficiaries of the impact of this research have been the Welsh\u000a      Government, Ministers\u000a      with relevant portfolio responsibilities, Sport Wales (as a Welsh\u000a      Government sponsored body),\u000a      local authorities, schools, national governing bodies for sport and\u000a      community providers of physical\u000a      activity. Importantly too, the findings of the national School Sport\u000a      Survey released by Sport Wales\u000a      in October 2013 indicate that the number of young people taking part in\u000a      sport or physical activity\u000a      three or more times a week has risen from 27% in 2011 to 40% in 2013.\u000a    Physical activity levels amongst children and young people have been a\u000a      focus of sustained work\u000a      by Sport Wales. The evaluation of the Secondary School Sport Pilot\u000a      Programme was reported in\u000a      2006 by researchers at Cardiff Met, and published in 2007 [2]. As a result\u000a      of the findings of that\u000a      evaluation there was a recommendation for the 5x60 programme to be\u000a      `rolled-out' across Wales9.\u000a      The recommendation was accepted and implemented by Sport Wales. By\u000a      November 2009, there\u000a      were 218 secondary schools involved, and 99% of all secondary schools had\u000a      a `5x60 Officer' in\u000a      post8.\u000a    The Free Swimming Initiative in Wales was the first free-to-use national\u000a      public health programme\u000a      linked to swimming in Europe, and the Welsh Government currently invests &#163;3.5\u000a        million per\u000a        annum in its delivery. The impact on its continuation made by the 42\u000a      page Final Report [4] was\u000a      made explicit by the Audit Committee of the National Assembly for Wales in\u000a      2008: \"The Assembly\u000a      Government's flagship scheme for increasing physical activity, its Free\u000a      Swimming initiative,\u000a      contains a number of weaknesses. We recommend that the Assembly\u000a        Government implement\u000a        the recommendations in relation to the Free Swimming Initiative made by\u000a        both the Auditor\u000a        General and the evaluation report produced by the University of Wales\u000a        Institute, Cardiff\"\u000a      [original emphasis]7.\u000a    The first clear evidence of the impact of the research was concerned with\u000a      data capture and\u000a      management of information about free swimming. The Interim and Final\u000a      Reports of the evaluation\u000a      led to a recognition of the inadequacy of the previous arrangements for\u000a      monitoring participation. As\u000a      a result, a joint report published in January 200811\u000a      acknowledged the work conducted at Cardiff\u000a      Met to establish the method and to collect important baseline data. It\u000a      also contained\u000a      recommendations about the practical requirements.\u000a    The Final Report was presented to the Welsh Government and the Free\u000a      Swimming Steering\u000a      Group, chaired by Sport Wales, in February 2008. Various pieces of\u000a      policy-related correspondence\u000a      make clear how the research shaped policy implementation in each of the 22\u000a      local authorities in\u000a      Wales. In 2010, a `Restricted &#8212; Cabinet Business Paper'2, drew\u000a      upon findings from the evaluation\u000a      some of which were circulated by Sports Wales10. From this, the\u000a      Minister for Heritage presented\u000a      proposals that were directly influenced by the list of policy implications\u000a      identified in the Final Report\u000a      [4]. These were accepted and put into effect3. They included:\u000a    \u000a      The Free Swimming Initiative to become embedded into `Local Authority\u000a        Partnership\u000a        Agreements' produced by each local authority2;\u000a      The extension of the entitlement to free swimming for young people\u000a        outside of school\u000a        holidays to include weekends2;\u000a      An increased variety of activities to attract a wider range of young\u000a        people2;\u000a      A review of target groups2 &#8212; most recently, between 2012\u000a        and 2013 a pilot has been\u000a        conducted on Free Swimming for Veterans and Armed Forces Personnel4.\u000a    \u000a    There were also findings from the Final Report that informed the\u000a      amendment to the previous\u000a      arrangements for free swimming:\u000a    \u000a      The requirement for a robust performance measurement system2;\u000a      A move away from `free splash' towards developing structured water\u000a        based activities.\u000a    \u000a    As a result new minimum levels of provision were implemented throughout\u000a      Wales2.\u000a    Additionally, the Free Swimming Programme in England launched after\u000a      publication of the Final\u000a      Report in Wales was symmetrical in the choice of targeted groups and main\u000a      beneficiaries. The\u000a      Research Brief for the `Evaluation of the Impact of Free Swimming' in\u000a      England, released in January\u000a      2009, noted specifically the evaluation of the Free Swimming Initiative in\u000a      Wales5. A Briefing Paper\u000a      from the Association for Public Service Excellence6 also drew\u000a      attention to the lessons learnt from\u000a      Wales in relation to the Initiative and reported relevant data11.\u000a      It concluded: \"The benefits of free\u000a      swimming initiatives have been evidenced (...) from the lessons learnt in\u000a      Wales, particularly in\u000a      relation to the over 60s\" (p.5) &#8212; two research references [5, 6] also\u000a      refer.\u000a    Commenting on the two main policy imperatives of the `Climbing Higher'\u000a      strategy, the former Chief\u000a      Executive Officer for Sport Wales notes [emphasis added]1, \"the\u000a        research produced by the\u000a        Cardiff School of Sport in relation to the Free Swimming Initiative and\u000a        `5x60' has impacted\u000a        on the future policy direction and implementation that these programmes\u000a        have taken.

The portfolio of\u000a      evaluation research that has been established since then (including\u000a      outputs returned in the\u000a      Research Assessment Exercise 2008) underpins this case study and acted as\u000a      a platform for the\u000a      investigation into two national pilot schemes that are central to the\u000a      Welsh Government's 2005\u000a      national strategy, Climbing Higher, which has the aim of\u000a      increasing participation in sport and\u000a      physical activity.\u000a    Research on the pilot study of the Active Young People programme\u000a      [2] was undertaken at a cost\u000a      of &#163;9,000, and was the first substantive secondary school based sport and\u000a      physical activity policy\u000a      for young people in Wales. The first phase of the research occurred during\u000a      2004 and involved a\u000a      quantitative survey of 1,834 twelve to fourteen year olds from the six\u000a      secondary schools involved in\u000a      the pilot. In order to avoid focusing on only `sporty' or `active'\u000a      children all year seven and year nine\u000a      pupils were invited to take part. Through the support of sport development\u000a      officers and teachers an\u000a      overall response rate of 81% was achieved, and contextual data about the\u000a      young people\u000a      themselves were captured. The second phase of the research included\u000a      individual interviews with\u000a      gatekeepers and 11 focus groups involving 43 pupils who had completed the\u000a      initial survey and\u000a      were grouped according to gender and level of interest in sport and\u000a      physical activity. The design\u000a      and delivery of the Active Young People programme was informed by\u000a      the analysis of the\u000a      participation patterns, the activities provided, the reasons for\u000a      participation and the important role\u000a      that the sports development officers played within the schools themselves.\u000a      In turn, this research\u000a        shaped the phased `roll-out' of 5x60 &#8212; a national scheme intended to\u000a      increase the number of\u000a      secondary age pupils taking part in sport or physical activity for 60\u000a      minutes, at least five times a\u000a      week.\u000a    The other national pilot is the Free Swimming Initiative, and its\u000a      evaluation is the second element of\u000a      this impact case study. Commissioned by the Welsh Government at a cost of\u000a      &#163;193,000, the body\u000a      of research was reported in a series of six Interim Reports leading to the\u000a      Final Report [4]. A mixed\u000a      methods approach was adopted that used multiple sources combining primary\u000a      and secondary\u000a      data. Five national surveys were undertaken during the pilot period\u000a      reflecting the different settings\u000a      in which the Free Swimming Initiative had been implemented. Two of the\u000a      surveys were with twelve\u000a      to fifteen year olds from 14 schools in 10 local authorities &#8212; first in\u000a      2005 (n=1,585) and then\u000a      repeated in 2006\/07 (n=1,864). Two more were with the managers of all\u000a      pools offering free\u000a      swimming &#8212; first in 2005 (n=119), and then in 2005\/06 (n=123) &#8212; response\u000a      rates were 76% and\u000a      66% respectively. Evidence was also gathered in 2005 about participation\u000a      by older people from a\u000a      survey of 404 swimmers at 26 swimming pools in 10 local authorities. All\u000a      local authorities were also\u000a      required to submit bi-monthly pool usage data which, once verified\u000a      independently, were analysed\u000a      and reported on by the research team. Secondary data were captured from\u000a      each local authority's\u000a      annual plan from 2004\/05 to 2007\/08, and through Sport Wales' national\u000a      biennial surveys which,\u000a      for young people, introduced specific questions on free swimming.\u000a    The qualitative research involved individual interviews with members of\u000a      the Steering Group (n=7)\u000a      in 2004\/5 that focused on national implementation and co-ordination\u000a      matters. These were followed\u000a      up in 2005 with 26 interviews that focused on local operational issues\u000a      with chief leisure officers,\u000a      lead support officers and swimming pool managers from a geographically\u000a      varied sample of six\u000a      local authorities. In 2006 further qualitative research was undertaken\u000a      through the use of 12 focus\u000a      groups (a total of 48 participants) with different sets of professional\u000a      stakeholders including, again,\u000a      chief leisure officers and swimming pool managers, but also policy\u000a      officers, and sports\u000a      development officers.\u000a    The initial collection of primary data informed the evaluation of the\u000a      Free Swimming Initiative and\u000a      shaped its implementation as a public health policy. Specifically, it\u000a        included, methodological and\u000a        other challenges faced in conducting this kind of research [5], and\u000a        some of the public policy\u000a        tensions that can exist when there are competing priorities for public\u000a        funding. The\u000a      experiences of older (60 plus) swimmers were also analysed and became the\u000a      basis of a micro-case\u000a      study of policy implementation and stakeholder engagement [6] and builds\u000a      upon the earlier\u000a      public sector sports development research in the same area, Blaenau Gwent\u000a      [3].\u000a    The researchers involved in this work are Anderson (appointed in\u000a      2005 as a Research Assistant,\u000a      now a Lecturer), Bolton (appointed in 2001 as a Senior Lecturer,\u000a      now a Principal Lecturer),\u000a      Davies (appointed in 1983 as a Lecturer, now a Principal Lecturer),\u000a      Fleming (a Senior Lecturer\u000a      1994-1999 who returned in 2005, now a Professor), Galdes\u000a      (appointed in 2003 as an Academic\u000a      Associate who left in 2009), Jennings (appointed in 1992 as a\u000a      Senior Lecturer, now a Principal\u000a      Lecturer), Smith B (appointed in 1998 as a Senior Lecturer, now a\u000a      Principal Lecturer), and Elias,\u000a      Leach and Martin (all external collaborators).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32841","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A dissemination strategy with significant reach across \"the football\u000d\u000a      family\" has been developed by RISES via the FEx. Within the current REF\u000d\u000a      period this has included organising the first world-wide football\u000d\u000a      (soccer)-specific conference in 2008. Progression from research, through\u000d\u000a      dissemination to translation has resulted in impact and change in multiple\u000d\u000a      facets of industry practice.\u000d\u000a    FEx research (Sec.3, Ref.1-2) has directly impacted upon the\u000d\u000a      development and application of modern day computerised data analysis\u000d\u000a      systems. These tools have revolutionised performance analysis capability\u000d\u000a      within the football industry. For example, research (Sec.3, Ref.1)\u000d\u000a      was crucial in allowing Prozone to demonstrate the accuracy and\u000d\u000a      reliability of its computerised system in 2010. Consequently these data\u000d\u000a      were instrumental in allowing Prozone to gain acceptance within the\u000d\u000a      football industry as the leading provider of automated tracking solutions,\u000d\u000a      enabling them to realise their aim of becoming the world's leading\u000d\u000a      provider with a turnover now approaching &#163;10 million per annum (Sec 5,\u000d\u000a        Source.1). To date the Prozone client base includes 64 % of the 92\u000d\u000a      English professional football clubs, 100 % of the English Premier League\u000d\u000a      clubs, the English senior men's national team, as well as a substantial\u000d\u000a      international client base (e.g. Qatar, China). An on-going relationship\u000d\u000a      between the FEx and Prozone includes a Knowledge Transfer Partnership\u000d\u000a      started in 2012 (jointly funded by ESRC and the Technology Strategy Board;\u000d\u000a      &#163;144K) and joint delivery of training courses for football industry staff\u000d\u000a      (25 courses with 637 participants since 2011; Sec.5, Source.2).\u000d\u000a      The data collected using computerized systems (Sec.3, Ref.2) has\u000d\u000a      transformed the interpretation of game-related statistics by coaching and\u000d\u000a      scientific staff in football clubs. This change in interpretation and new\u000d\u000a      data has proved beneficial for practitioners who use such data in the\u000d\u000a      development of intervention strategies for the performance plan(s) of\u000d\u000a      players, teams and organisations. This is exemplified by the use of these\u000d\u000a      data and processes by the lead analyst for the England senior men's\u000d\u000a      national team at the Football Association (FA; Sec.5, Source.3).\u000d\u000a    Other impact derived from FEx research includes changes to the training\u000d\u000a      and recovery strategies employed with players in elite clubs in order to\u000d\u000a      promote recovery and subsequent performance, as well as reducing the\u000d\u000a      incidence of injury. For example, research on small-sided games (Sec.3,\u000d\u000a        Ref.3) provided coaches with data to help guide, control and\u000d\u000a      optimise the training stimulus, thereby reducing the likelihood of\u000d\u000a      inappropriate loading patterns for individual players. As a consequence of\u000d\u000a      adopting these evidence-based procedures for the planning and monitoring\u000d\u000a      of training load there has been an increase in player availability via a\u000d\u000a      reduction in overall (14%) and \"potentially preventable\" injuries (16%)\u000d\u000a      within the Liverpool FC first team squad from 2012-2013 (Sec 5,\u000d\u000a        Source.4). Research into recovery strategies (Sec.3, Ref.4)\u000d\u000a      has been fundamental to the development of a specialist muscle recovery\u000d\u000a      and regeneration program at Manchester United FC that has also contributed\u000d\u000a      to increases in player match availability (14%; Sec.5, Source.5)\u000d\u000a      through a reduction in injury across the last three domestic seasons.\u000d\u000a    A significant component of impact derived from FEx research (Sec.3,\u000d\u000a        Ref.1-5) is the development and delivery of; 1) formal\u000d\u000a      academic training for key staff in the football workforce (e.g. Head of\u000d\u000a      Performance, The Premier League; The FA's Head of Exercise Science\u000d\u000a      [Female]; The FA's Head of Exercise Science [Male]; Head of Sports\u000d\u000a      Science, Manchester United FC); 2) club or association-specific\u000d\u000a      scientific support and continuing professional development; 3)\u000d\u000a      structured mentoring programs; 4) the production of independent\u000d\u000a      audit documentation for sport science and medicine provision within the\u000d\u000a      FA, and; 5) the development of coach education materials for the\u000d\u000a      FA. For example, FEx research and support were crucial to the\u000d\u000a      accreditation, by the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences,\u000d\u000a      of the High Performance Laboratory located at Manchester United FC's\u000d\u000a      training complex (Sec.5, Source.6). The FA has been one of the\u000d\u000a      major beneficiaries of the knowledge created from FEx research activity\u000d\u000a      for the development of evidence-based practice (Sec.5, Source.7).\u000d\u000a      The FA is responsible for the delivery of all technical, medical and\u000d\u000a      science curricula related to football and coaching in England. Through\u000d\u000a      important physiological insights (Sec.3, Ref.1-4) the FEx have\u000d\u000a      delivered core components, and revised the entire syllabus of the Applied\u000d\u000a      Football Science and Conditioning Award (between 2010 and 2012) that\u000d\u000a      directly shapes the activity of the science and medicine community within\u000d\u000a      the sport (to date in excess of 60 practitioners) (Sec.5, Source.8).\u000d\u000a      Specific research (Sec.3, Ref. 5) has also been important in\u000d\u000a      creating the strategies and approaches to player learning detailed in\u000d\u000a      coach education curricula within the new FA Youth Awards (Sec.5,\u000d\u000a        Source.9).\u000d\u000a    Overall the research activity of the FEx has demonstrable impact across\u000d\u000a      key areas of activity within the football industry. As a consequence the\u000d\u000a      FEx has been at the forefront of the implementation of evidence-based\u000d\u000a      practice within the football industry both nationally and internationally\u000d\u000a      over the current REF cycle.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Football has significant sporting, cultural and economic impact with\u000d\u000a      reach around the globe. Despite this, football has long been resistant to\u000d\u000a      evidence-based practice. Football-related research at the Research\u000d\u000a      Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences (RISES) includes match and\u000d\u000a      training analysis and various aspects of player preparation and recovery.\u000d\u000a      This research has been translated into evidenced-based practice to produce\u000d\u000a      impact within multiple layers of football in the UK and abroad.

The pioneering work of Professor Tom Reilly in\u000d\u000a      the mid 1970's created gold standard methodologies and novel information\u000d\u000a      on the activity profile of players and the demands of the sport. Football\u000d\u000a      research continued and expanded within RISES and as a consequence the\u000d\u000a      Football Exchange (FEx) was launched in 2010 as an interdisciplinary group\u000d\u000a      responsible for the strategic management and delivery of research,\u000d\u000a      external consultancy and translation of knowledge to the football\u000d\u000a      industry. The FEx contains key staff associated with research and impact\u000d\u000a      translation included in this case study; Prof Barry Drust (1990-1998;\u000d\u000a      2003-present), Dr. Warren Gregson (2004-present), Dr. Paul Ford\u000d\u000a      (2007-present). Overall, FEx activity has resulted in 140+ scientific\u000d\u000a      papers and ~ &#163;1.5 million in grant and industry income since 1993.\u000d\u000a    Football research activity within the FEx has analysed multiple facets of\u000d\u000a      match and training exposure, providing empirical data that forms the basis\u000d\u000a      of evidence-based practice in relation to individualised physical training\u000d\u000a      regimes. FEx staff have produced multiple research outputs in this area\u000d\u000a      that have focused on two specific issues; 1) the development of\u000d\u000a      match analysis tools (Sec.3, Ref.1), and 2) the detailed\u000d\u000a      data collection of player activity in the real-world (Sec.3, Ref.2).\u000a      The data generated in Sec.3, Ref.1 established the validity and\u000d\u000a      reliability of Prozone Ltd's automated match-analysis tool, which is now\u000d\u000a      the world's leading computerised performance analysis system. The system\u000d\u000a      was shown to be highly accurate (within 0.4%) and reliable (~1.5-6 %) at\u000d\u000a      quantifying match-related displacement velocities. The key focus of Sec.3,\u000a        Ref.2 was match-to-match variability in the activity profiles of\u000d\u000a      elite players. This paper contributed detailed insights into the match\u000d\u000a      performance of players including substantial match-to-match variability in\u000d\u000a      key activities such as high speed running (~16 %) and total sprint\u000d\u000a      distance (~30%). This demonstrated the difficulties in obtaining accurate\u000d\u000a      representations of a player's performance profile from any single match\u000d\u000a      exposure.\u000d\u000a    Research from FEx staff have analysed multiple facets of player\u000d\u000a      preparation and recovery. In a novel study (Sec.3, Ref.3) the\u000d\u000a      impact of manipulating pitch dimensions on the physiological demands of\u000d\u000a      training (small-sided games) was examined. Heart rate was similar between\u000d\u000a      3 different pitch sizes (30x20 m, ~176; 40 x 30 m, ~173 and 50 x 40 m,\u000d\u000a      ~169 beats.min-1) despite a greater frequency of game-related\u000d\u000a      actions (tackles, shots on goal) when the pitch size was smallest,\u000d\u000a      suggesting that technical training can be increased without an elevation\u000d\u000a      in physical training load. Fundamental scientific research linked to\u000d\u000a      player recovery has also been undertaken by the FEx (Sec.3, Ref.4).\u000d\u000a      This study provided novel physiological data on the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      cold-water immersion (CWI), a commonly used recovery practice in elite\u000d\u000a      professional football. The study compared 2 x 5 min exposures to water\u000d\u000a      immersion at temperatures of 8 and 22oC. A similar reduction\u000d\u000a      (~40 %) in whole limb blood flow (femoral artery conductance) was observed\u000d\u000a      with immersion in both water temperatures. Interestingly, more blood\u000d\u000a      (~15%) was distributed to the skin in the colder water suggesting a\u000d\u000a      potential mechanism for the effectiveness of CWI in reducing muscle damage\u000d\u000a      following exercise.\u000d\u000a    The development of effective practice and training for improving player's\u000d\u000a      technical skills is also an important part of the training stimulus. Ford\u000d\u000a      et al. (Sec.3, Ref.5) analysed the practice activities and\u000d\u000a      instructional behaviours of coaches across multiple training sessions with\u000d\u000a      youth football players. The researchers observed that 65% of the\u000d\u000a      activities undertaken in training did not contribute to the development of\u000d\u000a      the decision making skills in players. Moreover, the coaches made a large\u000d\u000a      amount of verbalised instructional behaviours during these sessions. Both\u000d\u000a      findings are considered to be detrimental to skill acquisition in\u000d\u000a      football. Based on these findings, the authors made a number of\u000d\u000a      recommendations to coaches and governing bodies for optimising the skill\u000d\u000a      acquisition occurring from training sessions.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33764","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of research produced by this research group can be evidenced\u000a      in three key ways:\u000a    a) Reach: Raising public awareness\u000a      The strategy to gain wide scale impact has been focused on work designed\u000a      to raise public awareness. The reach of the research's social impact has\u000a      been aided by worldwide exposure via the BBC Lab UK, the London Marathon\u000a      Website, international magazines such as Runner's World, and commentary in\u000a      national and international newspapers. This coverage has led to further\u000a      exposure via Reuters and other worldwide media agencies. A high-profile\u000a      example being promotion to recruit participants to the BBC Lab UK project\u000a      featuring on the prime time television show the `One-Show' where Michael\u000a      Johnson narrated the video clips in the research. More recently, a film\u000a      commissioned by Copa 90, an independent television channel, on dealing\u000a      with stress during soccer penalty shooting has been viewed over 55,000\u000a      times.\u000a    b) Usage of self-help materials\u000a      In an experiment that was conducted in conjunction with Runner's World\u000a      Magazine and Audiofuel, RCSEP compared the effects of training\u000a      interventions assigned to 1050 runners. We provided individualised\u000a      feedback regarding intervention outcomes, and summarised results on YouTube.\u000a      Resources developed from the group's research, designed to support runners\u000a      have been openly available on the London Marathon website since 2010. Tips\u000a      are also posted via email to all entrants (&gt; 50,000 per year) as part\u000a      of the build-up to the event and runners can sign up for monthly\u000a        training tips. Building on this work, the research group hosted a\u000a      weekend workshop for runners (Knowing Sport Pilot scheme; January, 2011)\u000a      that introduced a series of self-help interventions focussed on\u000a      performance enhancement. We have also delivered self-help interventions on\u000a      mass. In an online experiment run in collaboration with BBC Lab UK\u000a      (2012-2013), 75,000 people worldwide used brief interventions (imagery,\u000a      self-talk, and planning) to facilitate performance during a competitive\u000a      online game. Olympian Michael Johnson delivered the training and narrated\u000a      the computer-generated individualised feedback. The feedback highlighted\u000a      the relationship between emotions and performance, and how to change\u000a      emotions. Comments posted by users were very positive, including accounts\u000a      of how participation had helped individuals perform better in a range of\u000a      roles (e.g., musician, exam student, driving instructor, chef, etc). As a\u000a      result of such initiatives, Professor Lane featured as an expert on the\u000a      popular weekly podcast \"Marathon\u000a        Talk\", speaking about psychological control for marathon runners.\u000a    The group have been involved in three externally funded (RCUK; ESRC)\u000a      events to disseminate findings to the general public. Research Councils UK\u000a      funded a workshop on emotion regulation for runners intended to\u000a      disseminate sports sciences to the general public (January, 2011).\u000a      Participant feedback following this event was positive with a number of\u000a      runners reporting completing personal best performances in the weeks\u000a      following the workshop. Second, the group also presented a workshop on\u000a      emotion and emotion regulation in sport at the Festival of Science\u000a      (November, 2011). Third, Professor Lane presented at the \"Cutting Edge\"\u000a      series on emotional control in diving, June 2012, a presentation that\u000a      included both Tom Daley and his coach Andy Banks. All three events were\u000a      popular, attracting over 500 delegates and receiving media coverage, which\u000a      ensured a wider reach. The cutting edge series is available to view via\u000a      the Research\u000a        Councils video page.\u000a    c) Direct benefit of being involved in the research\u000a      Participants have been the immediate beneficiaries of the groups research.\u000a      For example, participants in the BBC Lab UK project were not only taught\u000a      how to use an intervention, but also received immediate feedback on their\u000a      responses to questionnaires and performance in the test. Previously, in\u000a      the project developed in conjunction with Runner's\u000a        World, each participant (N= 1050, Lane et al., 2010) received\u000a      personalised feedback and advice on how to improve their mental approach\u000a      to running. A further example of benefits to participants can be\u000a      illustrated by RCSEP's research partnership with NHS West Midlands. A\u000a      project aimed at improving health and well-being among NHS staff resulted\u000a      in the development of e-resources\u000a        on health, well-being and their measurement. These were provided to\u000a      all NHS employees via open access on the internet. RCSEP also provided\u000a      self-help material for the NHS\u000a        live well project on how to use music when running on the couch to\u000a      5km programme.\u000a    A strategy to maximise awareness of our underpinning research has been to\u000a      work with high-profile athletes who engage in extreme sports. For example,\u000a      we worked with Sport Relief in preparation for TV presenter\u000a      Christine Bleakley's water-ski crossing of the English Channel (March,\u000a      2010).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the development and usage of self-help\u000a      material designed to aid people in feeling and performing better.

The has led to two\u000a        expert statements with practical guidelines, one on emotion\u000a      regulation and one on using music in sport and exercise. Underpinning this\u000a      work, RCSEP research has developed valid and reliable measures to enable\u000a      rigorous testing of theory in different areas. These include a measure\u000a        of mood validated across cultures (BRUMS: Terry et al., 1999; Terry\u000a      &amp; Lane, 2010), a measure that distinguishes mood from emotion (Beedie\u000a      et al., 2011), and a brief measure of emotional intelligence (Davies et\u000a      al., 2010). RCSEP have developed tools to help guide intervention work\u000a      including a measure that assesses the motivational effects of music during\u000a      exercise (Karageorghis et al., 2012).\u000a    RCSEP have examined the effectiveness of self-regulation strategies used\u000a      to help people perform and feel better. For example, studies have\u000a      investigated relationships between mood and performance among athletes\u000a      (Devonport &amp; Lane, 2009; Friesen, Devonport, Sellars et al., 2013;\u000a      Lane, 2009). We have also examined how athletes cope during endurance\u000a      events such as running (Lane et al., 2001; Lane &amp; Wilson, 2010;\u000a      Stanley et al., 2012), cycling (Beedie et al., 2012) and ultra-endurance\u000a      in extreme conditions (Devonport &amp; Lane, 2011; Lahart et al., 2013).\u000a      Work with industry has entailed examination of products such as natural\u000a      light simulation (Lumie\u000a        Lights) for athletes who train early in the morning (Lane, 2011),\u000a      and music designed (AudioFuel)\u000a      to aid performance (Karageorghis et al., 2012). In conjunction with \"Runner's\u000a        World\", we examined the use of cognitive strategies such as\u000a      self-talk and if-then planning to help runners manage emotions and improve\u000a      performance (Lane et al., 2010). A recent project in collaboration with BBC Lab UK\u000a      investigated the effects of brief interventions on emotions and\u000a      performance. In this project, participants received one of three possible\u000a      interventions before competing in a concentration grid test designed for\u000a      the study. On completion, participants received personalised feedback\u000a      addressing emotions associated with best performance, effectiveness of the\u000a      intervention, and guidance on transferring this knowledge to everyday\u000a      life.\u000a    The research group has received considerable external financial support.\u000a      This includes a 4-year ESRC grant to fund the Emotion Regulation of Others\u000a      and Self project (&#163;485,000), support to deliver an end-user event during\u000a      the Festival of Science (Research Councils UK: RCUK, &#163;1000), and support\u000a      to present at the Research Councils UK, Cutting Edge series with Olympic\u000a      diver, Tom Daley. The group received a grant from the British Association\u000a      of Sport and Exercise Sciences (BASES: &#163;1500) to produce an expert\u000a      statement on emotion regulation (Lane et al., 2012).

These areas of expertise\u000a      have been combined in studies aiming to improve health outcomes and\u000a      quality of life in selected populations, and minimise the costs of disease\u000a      and injury treatment via novel physical activity interventions. Our\u000a      success and international recognition can be confirmed by the frequent use\u000a      of our results by national and international bodies in the following\u000a      areas:\u000a    Chronic Disease: RCSEP research has helped identify\u000a      factors, such as specific medication dosage, genetic polymorphisms\u000a      (Panoulas et al., 2008, Panoulas et al., 2009) and physical inactivity\u000a      (Metsios et al., 2008, 2009, 2012) that may lead to increased risk for\u000a      heart disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Our current research,\u000a      partly funded by the Medical Research Council, focuses on behavioural\u000a      interventions to improve physical activity adherence, reduce the risk of\u000a      cardiovascular disease, and assess the cost effectiveness of specific\u000a      exercise interventions. Smoking: Despite efforts by\u000a      Governments world-wide, smoking remains a serious health hazard with\u000a      enormous quality-of-life and economic implications. Our innovative work in\u000a      this area demonstrated, for the first time in humans, that even acute\u000a      exposure to second-hand smoke causes detrimental health effects, including\u000a      respiratory, cardiovascular, immune and endocrine (Flouris et al., 2009).\u000a      We are one of the very few research teams in Europe working in this area\u000a      (Stavropoulos et al., 2008; Flouris et al., 2009, 2010, 2012; Metsios et\u000a      al., 2010).\u000a      Dance Science: RCSEP research has aspired to reduce injury\u000a      incidence and improve performance in elite dancers. We verified that RCESP\u000a      developed interventions reduce injury incidence by about 50% (Allen et\u000a      al., 2013). In conjunction with Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB) and\u000a      Harlequin Floors Plc we examined the BRB's dance floors and the stages\u000a      that they tour on (Hopper et al., 2013). This led to Harlequin developing\u000a      a travelling stage for BRB that mimics the mechanical properties of their\u000a      rehearsal studios, thereby reducing injuries. In a separate strand of\u000a      research, RCSEP have demonstrated vitamin D deficiency among dancers\u000a      during winter periods; a subsequent controlled intervention study revealed\u000a      improved muscle function and reduced injury occurrence in dancers on\u000a      vitamin D supplementation (Wyon et al., 2013). As a result, companies,\u000a      including the Royal Ballet, have implemented vitamin D supplementation\u000a      programmes for their dancers. RCSEP are one of the most well-recognised\u000a      dance-science research teams worldwide with more than 30 publications in\u000a      the last 2 years, partly the product of established collaborations with\u000a      hospitals (e.g., Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, London), research\u000a      institutions (e.g., Institute of Human Performance and Rehabilitation,\u000a      Greece) and industrial establishments (e.g., ArtEZ Conservatoire,\u000a      Netherlands, Harlequin Plc and SunVit).\u000a    Key Researchers: Yiannis Koutedakis, Professor in Applied\u000a      Physiology, 1992-present; Alan Nevill, Professor in Research 1999-present;\u000a      Matthew Wyon, Professor in Dance Science, 2002-present; George Metsios,\u000a      Reader in Clinical Exercise Physiology, 2007-present; Ross Cloak, Lecturer\u000a      2010-present.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34974","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The beneficiaries of this applied research were primarily the management,\u000a      coaching staff and players (senior and academy) of St Helens RFC (Date of\u000a      impacts: November 2010-September 2012), Warrington Wolves RFC (Date of\u000a      impact: September 2008-September 2010), and Premiership rugby union clubs\u000a      (Date of impact: September 2011-July 2013) as well as the governing bodies\u000a      of rugby league (RFL. Date of impact: January 2011-July 2013) and rugby\u000a      union (RFU. Date of impact: September 2011-July 2013). Contracts with all\u000a      organizations have existed during the assessment period for employment of\u000a      research students to conduct knowledge transfer activities (RFL,\u000a      2006-2010; Warrington Wolves RFC, 2006-2010; St Helens RFC, 2009-present)\u000a      or funded studentships (RFU, 2010-present). Some of these contracts remain\u000a      to ensure on-going impact from the original research or development of new\u000a      research.\u000a    Until this research was performed, the movement demands of elite rugby\u000a      players (league and union) were based on out-dated evidence or\u000a      inappropriate populations. Accordingly, professional clubs were unable to\u000a      deliver training programmes informed by the internal and external loads\u000a      currently imposed on players in Super League (rugby league) and English\u000a      Premiership (rugby union) competitions. Therefore, the primary impact of\u000a      this Group's research has been to influence coaching practice via the\u000a      objective quantification of individual player, and positional specific\u000a      demands during competitive match play. Data from competitive matches\u000a      (Waldron et al., 2011; Sykes et al., 2011; Cahill et al., 2012; Waldron et\u000a      al., 2013) were reported to the management and coaching staff of St Helens\u000a      RFC, Warrington Wolves RFC and via one-to-one meetings with staff of\u000a      several Premiership rugby union clubs. Findings were also fed into the\u000a      national governing body via national coaching conferences (RFU), seminars\u000a      (RFL) and invited symposia (BASES Annual Conferences 2009 and 2013), which\u000a      enabled dissemination of the work to a wider audience of academics and\u000a      practitioners.\u000a    The extent of the impact is evidenced in coaches' use of the data to\u000a      construct and deliver sport- specific, field-based practices that prepare\u000a      players for the demands of the competitive environment. For example, our\u000a      work has had direct impact on coaches' practices at St Helens RFC where we\u000a      helped to inform position- and individual-specific conditioning\u000a      strategies. More specifically, we have helped design and implement\u000a      training practices (i.e. drills) that are based on worst-case game\u000a      scenarios that have been employed by coaches and `ensure players are\u000a        conditioned to meet the demands of competitive matches' (St Helens\u000a      RFC, see 5.1). Governing bodies (i.e. RFL) have also incorporated our data\u000a      into `The re-structure of the RFL competition framework for Super\u000a        League Academies' (RFL, 5.1), and coach education resources which `have\u000a        helped to change the delivery approach taken by many coaches across all\u000a        levels and have provided a more evidence-based approach to the use of\u000a        small-sided games in coaching young rugby league players' (RFL,\u000a      5.1). These data have enabled rigorous evolution of individual clubs'\u000a      training practices and have been used to benchmark player performance in\u000a      relation to recovery and subsequent training. Accordingly, our research\u000a      has been used by the RFL and `has been central to recent changes that\u000a        we [RFL] have implemented to the RFL Player Development Pathway and the\u000a        England programme in particular' (RFL, 5.1). Assessing the movement\u000a      demands during matches has also allowed a better understanding of fatigue\u000a      (defined as reductions in high intensity activity during a match) and the\u000a      degree to which players `pace' their involvement within a game (e.g. Sykes\u000a      et al., 2011; Waldron et al., 2013). More specifically, the studies have\u000a      been invaluable for informing coaches on the preparation and use of\u000a      interchange players (i.e. substitutions) who, it appears, have different\u000a      movement characteristics to those of whole-game players (Waldron et al.,\u000a      2013). Accordingly, clear evidence to support the impact of our work has\u000a      been St Helens RFC's implementation of their interchange strategies during\u000a      the 2011 and 2012 seasons based on the research we had conducted with\u000a      them, i.e. `we refined our preparation of individual players and\u000a        implementation strategy for interchange players during games\u000a        based on the data collected as part of the initial GPS project in 2009'\u000a      (St Helens RFC, 5.1).\u000a    In the case of rugby union, GPS data are collected and analyzed each week\u000a      then entered onto a central database (Rugby Football Union `Elite Hub')\u000a      for clubs to review. Data are then used to review individual and team\u000a      workloads, from which club training practices can be altered to optimize\u000a      performance (RFU, 5.1). These data are also used by international coaches\u000a      to monitor player match and training loads in advance of international\u000a      matches and training camps (RFU, 5.1).\u000a    Evaluating the efficacy of training programmes or dietary manipulations\u000a      in rugby players, monitoring player performance after injury or assessing\u000a      a player's match capability is problematic due to a variety of issues\u000a      involved in studying real matches. For example, individual between- match\u000a      variability of approximately 15% in high intensity running has been\u000a      reported in rugby league, meaning that match-to-match comparisons of\u000a      performance are impractical. This measurement `noise' complicates the\u000a      assessment of systematic changes in match-related performance variables,\u000a      thereby hindering potential developments in the understanding of rugby\u000a      performance. Experimental research in a team sport environment is also\u000a      often considered to be invasive and difficult to control, thus preventing\u000a      its use with elite rugby players. To avoid such problems, the research\u000a      from the initial movement demands studies has been used in conjunction\u000a      with Higher Education Innovation Funding to develop a match simulation\u000a      protocol that simulates the movement patterns observed during rugby league\u000a      matches (Sykes et al., 2012; Waldron et al., 2013). This provides a more\u000a      stable research model with which to detect systematic changes in\u000a      performance and has several applications, including; informing coaching\u000a      practice and player selection (i.e. talent identification), player\u000a      rehabilitation and research. These match simulation protocols (Sykes et\u000a      al., 2012; Waldron et al., 2013) are now adopted by the broader rugby\u000a      league community for the assessment, monitoring and conditioning of rugby\u000a      league players. For example, our work has changed practice at two Super\u000a      League clubs who have used the simulation protocol to condition players to\u000a      specific match demands (St Helens RFC, 5.1) and determine players'\u000a      suitability to return to play after injury and rehabilitation (Widnes\u000a      Vikings RFC, 5.1). That is to say, rather than using running tests based\u000a      on subjective opinion as was the practice before, practitioners now have\u000a      players perform the simulation protocol (or part of) to ascertain their\u000a      physical capacity and ability to tolerate the running and contact demands\u000a      associated with match play. Coaches are now able to make informed\u000a      decisions on the player's capacity and how they might be best managed on\u000a      their return to play. The outcome is more objective judgement of player\u000a      capacity and a lower incidence of re-injury on return to play. The\u000a      protocols are also being used in current projects to answer coach-led\u000a      research questions that will impact on improving performance via training,\u000a      nutritional or tactical interventions.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The main applied outcomes of this body of research have been: (i) the\u000a      objective quantification of individual player demands during competitive\u000a      match play to better understand the typical internal and external loads\u000a      imposed on rugby players; (ii) identification of fatigue characteristics\u000a      and pacing strategies of interchange and whole-game players to inform\u000a      training practices and tactical strategies; (iii) the design of\u000a      appropriate training practices to ensure players are conditioned to\u000a      tolerate the most demanding passages of play during competitive matches;\u000a      and, (iv) the development of match simulation protocols for the objective\u000a      evaluation of player performance.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Chester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Chester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Chester","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007848}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    The basic research underpinning the impact was manifest in the following\u000a      papers:\u000a    \u000aCahill, N., Lamb, K., Worsfold, P., Headey, R., &amp; Murray, S.

The research quantified the external and internal match\u000a      demands of elite rugby league and rugby union players. Global Positioning\u000a      System (GPS) technology and video analysis were used to measure the total\u000a      and relative distances, number of collisions, heart rate and perceived\u000a      exertion (session RPE) for different positional groups during matches.\u000a      Depending on playing position, elite players cover mean distances of 4,200 - 6,900 m\u000a\u0009  (89-95 m&#183;min-1) and 5,100 - 7,100 m (62-78 m&#183;min-1)\u000a      in rugby league and rugby union, respectively. Rugby league players\u000a      demonstrate reductions in high intensity (31%) and very high intensity\u000a      running (47%) between the first and last quarter of a match. More\u000a      importantly, replacement players adopt a high initial intensity in their\u000a      first match quartile before a severe decline thereafter. However, in a\u000a      second bout, lower exercise intensity at the outset enables a higher\u000a      physiological exertion for later periods. Rugby league forwards are\u000a      involved in a collision approximately every minute, whereas this occurs\u000a      less frequently for backs (0.3 per minute) and adjustables (0.6 per\u000a      minute) during a match. Mean heart rates ~82-84% of maximum heart rate\u000a      were measured, with summated heart rate values of ~200, ~270 and ~300 AU,\u000a      and session RPE values of ~240, ~435 and ~380 AU for forwards, adjustables\u000a      and outside backs, respectively.\u000a    The case study emanated from the research of a group consisting of five\u000a      members of academic staff, supplemented by a core of PhD students: Dr\u000a      Craig Twist (Leader\/Senior Lecturer\/Reader, 2004-present); Dr Paul\u000a      Worsfold (Leader\/Senior Lecturer, 2006-present); Dr Jamie Highton (PhD\u000a      student, 2007-2011\/Lecturer, 2012-present); Dr Kevin Lamb (Reader,\u000a      1992-present); Dr Ceri Nicholas (Senior Lecturer, 2006-present); Dr Mark\u000a      Waldron (PhD student, 2009-2012.

(2012) responded to a request by coaches at St\u000a      Helens RFC seeking to better\u000a      understand the time-course of recovery in players in the days immediately\u000a      after a game. The\u000a      research had four distinct aims based on the coaches' need to know: a)\u000a      whether the current\u000a      periodization of training in the days immediately after a game was\u000a      appropriate; b) if recovery\u000a      patterns differed between positional groups; c) the role of match demands\u000a      on player recovery; and,\u000a      d) the response to currently adopted recovery measures. The research\u000a      provided a better\u000a      understanding of these issues and enabled coaches to devise suitable\u000a      training and monitoring\u000a      strategies in the days immediately after a game in order to optimize\u000a      player recovery. For example,\u000a      `This [research] has enabled us to programme training schedules more\u000a        effectively after matches\u000a        and better manage player fatigue on an individual basis. Indeed,\u000a        recovery protocols and monitoring\u000a      processes were changed as a consequence of the work conducted' (St\u000a      Helens RFC, see 5.1). The\u000a      research initiated many changes to the daily and seasonal practices of\u000a      staff at St Helens RFC,\u000a      including: the identification of meaningful changes in individual player\u000a      well-being using a daily\u000a      monitoring system; introduction of a neuromuscular monitoring protocol in\u000a      the days after matches;\u000a      the integration of match data with monitoring data to evaluate individual\u000a      player recovery and\u000a      training load; the implementation of a system for monitoring of individual\u000a      player training load; and,\u000a      the introduction of player education material to optimize health,\u000a      performance and recovery (e.g.\u000a      nutrition and recovery guidelines produced for Warrington Wolves and St\u000a      Helens rugby clubs that\u000a      are now provided to all players. From a position where player recovery and\u000a      training schedules\u000a      were based on coach intuition, the implementation of monitoring strategies\u000a      to manage player\u000a      fatigue and training practice content are seen as key impacts from the\u000a      Group's work.\u000a    Minimal recovery between matches and training occurs frequently during\u000a      tournament scenarios for\u000a      team sport athletes. Accordingly, the Group sought to better understand\u000a      the impact of intensified\u000a      competition on player recovery and performance (Johnston et al., 2013)\u000a      working in collaboration\u000a      with colleagues from Heriot-Watt University, Australian Catholic\u000a      University and the RFL. Findings\u000a      were used by Home Nations coaches to guide player monitoring strategies\u000a      during the international\u000a      competitions, which subsequently informed player selection and game time\u000a      throughout the\u000a      tournament. Our work has been used to `build an argument regarding the\u000a        over use of players\u000a        during the Easter period' (RFL, 5.1). Additionally, the recovery\u000a      practices of other sports have been\u000a      influenced by our work, such as the Scotland Football squad and Scotland\u000a      squash (Heriot-Watt\u000a      University). Similarly, the work has since been extended with the England\u000a      Handball Association\u000a      (EHA) to inform their own practices during European training camps and\u000a      tournaments. In an\u000a      emerging sport with little or no previous sports science input, our\u000a      research has assisted in the\u000a      implementation of new policies and changed the approaches taken by coaches\u000a      during\u000a      tournaments. For example, the lead sport scientist has employed our\u000a      recommendations for daily\u000a      monitoring of player well-being and neuromuscular function to enable\u000a      management of player\u000a      training loads and recovery strategies during national and international\u000a      competitions where multiple\u000a      fixtures in 4-5 day tournaments are commonplace. This information has been\u000a      critical with athletes\u000a      who are unaccustomed to the rigours of international tournaments, so much\u000a      so that the impact of\u000a      our work has been `useful to inform coaches of players more\u000a        susceptible to injury or illness so that\u000a        their practices can be adjusted. Monitoring is also used to identify\u000a        players who have decreased\u000a        physical performance, which can be used by coaches in team selection or\u000a        to inform player match\u000a        time' (EHA, 5.1).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The main applied outcomes of this body of research have been: (i) changes\u000a      to training, competition\u000a      and between-match practices at St Helens and Warrington Wolves Super\u000a      League clubs, and in\u000a      Rugby Football League (RFL) generally, and England Handball Association;\u000a      (ii) the development of\u000a      appropriate monitoring strategies to manage player health, well-being and\u000a      performance capability;\u000a      and, (iii) the development of player and coach education resources.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Chester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Chester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Chester","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007848}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    The basic research underpinning the impact was manifest in the following\u000a      papers:\u000a    \u000aJohnston, R., Gibson, N.V., Twist, C., Gabbett, T.J., MacNay, S., &amp;\u000a      MacFarlane, N., (2013).\u000a      Physiological responses to an intensified period of rugby league\u000a      competition.

Neuromuscular, biochemical and perceptual\u000a      responses were measured in\u000a      elite and sub-elite players in the days after a single match and during\u000a      intensified competition (three\u000a      representative matches in five days). In addition, match performance\u000a      characteristics were\u000a      measured using global positioning technology and video analysis. After a\u000a      single match, creatine\u000a      kinase, muscle soreness and sensations of fatigue were higher for up to\u000a      two days in both forwards\u000a      and backs. Neuromuscular function was lower on day one but not day two for\u000a      both groups.\u000a      Collisions for forwards were correlated with all markers of fatigue but\u000a      only neuromuscular function\u000a      was correlated with offensive contacts in backs. During intensified\u000a      matches, upper and lower body\u000a      neuromuscular function, perceived fatigue and creatine kinase deteriorated\u000a      as the competition\u000a      progressed. Cumulative fatigue corresponded to reductions in high speed\u000a      running and tackling\u000a      during matches later in the tournament. These findings have identified\u000a      some of the key contributors\u000a      to post match fatigue in rugby players and enable coaches to employ\u000a      appropriate measurement\u000a      strategies to manage player health and performance capacity.\u000a    This case study emanated from the research of a group consisting of four\u000a      members of academic\u000a      staff, supplemented by a core of PhD students: Dr Craig Twist\u000a      (Leader\/Senior Lecturer\/Reader,\u000a      2004-present); Dr Jamie Highton (PhD student, 2007-2011\/Lecturer,\u000a      2012-present); Dr Kevin\u000a      Lamb (Reader, 1992-present); Dr Ceri Nicholas (Senior Lecturer,\u000a      2006-present); Dr Mark Waldron\u000a      (PhD student, 2009-2012.

Together, the\u000a      TUE committee developed\u000a      guidelines and a diagnostic algorithm for the TUE process (Sources 1 and\u000a      4) that was adopted by\u000a      the UK National Anti-Doping Agency and used as the framework for medical\u000a      practitioners in the\u000a      diagnosis of EIA.\u000a    The early studies (References 1 and 2) and work on the TUE committee\u000a      highlighted the lack of\u000a      access or availability of centres that provided objective\u000a      bronchoprovocation testing. So Ansley and\u000a      Robson-Ansley started Sport Asthma (www.sportasthma.co.uk), which is a\u000a      consultancy service\u000a      that runs out of Northumbria University. Sport Asthma offers eucapnic\u000a      voluntary hyperpnea (EVH)\u000a      and allergy testing to athletes and referral service for physicians; EVH\u000a      is the bronchoprovocation\u000a      test recommended by the International Olympic Committee due to its high\u000a      sensitivity and\u000a      specificity. Sport Asthma is a UK Sport recommended testing centre in\u000a      England\u000a      (http:\/\/www.ukad.org.uk\/support-personnel\/asthma\/)\u000a      and is endorsed by Allergy UK (email from\u000a      Clinical Director of Allergy UK, 30\/04\/2009) (Source 6). Sport Asthma has\u000a      tested nearly 100\u000a      symptomatic athletes from various sports (swimming, athletics, cricket,\u000a      rugby and football) and to\u000a      date Sport Asthma has identified 27 athletes misdiagnosed with EIA who\u000a      were using asthma\u000a      medication unnecessarily. The interpretation of the results provided in\u000a      our reports to medical\u000a      practitioners has guided subsequent treatment and management of athletes\u000a      with exercise-induced\u000a      respiratory symptoms (Source 3).\u000a    Sport Asthma has worked closely with two regional professional football\u000a      teams (Newcastle United\u000a      Football Club and Sunderland Association Football Club) to implement a\u000a      screening programme for\u000a      all their players. This has been very successful and through this\u000a      programme with 49 asymptomatic\u000a      players screened so far, and 17 (34%) players have been diagnosed with EIA\u000a      and are now\u000a      receiving appropriate treatment (Source 3). The treatment efficacy of a\u000a      correct diagnosis is\u000a      currently being assessed in a study that evaluates the effective use of\u000a      inhaler technique by athletes\u000a      who use asthma medication.\u000a    The consultancy work with professional athletes has generated significant\u000a      interest from the media.\u000a      Most notable was the involvement in a documentary commissioned by the\u000a      British Medical Journal\u000a      (BMJ), which explored EIA. The film is posted on the BMJ website as part\u000a      of their continuing\u000a      education programme and provides a resource for clinicians\u000a      (http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/multimedia\/video\/2012\/04\/25\/exercise-induced-asthma).\u000a      Other press\u000a      exposure included two feature articles in Running Fitness (August 2009 and\u000a      May 2010), a national\u000a      magazine with a monthly circulation of 34,000, and an article in The\u000a      Journal newspaper (11\u000a      September 2009), which has a daily readership of over 26,000.

In\u000a      order to educate the public on lung health Ansley encouraged the MSc\u000a      Clinical Exercise\u000a      Physiology students to organise a Healthy Lung Awareness Day at the\u000a      university. The students\u000a      measured lung function and provided advice and feedback to over 300 staff\u000a      and students.\u000a      In addition to informing the general public about EIA and allergy in\u000a      athletes Ansley and Robson-\u000a      Ansley have given invited presentations to clinicians at conferences (e.g.\u000a      Royal Society of\u000a      Medicine 2012; EAACI Annual Congress, 2013) and workshops (e.g. EAACI\u000a      Asthma Summer\u000a      School 2010 and 2012).\u000a    In 2009 Ansley and Robson-Ansley obtained funding from Phadia Diagnostics\u000a      (&#163;16,000) to look at\u000a      allergy in athletes. The results from this study were published in a\u000a      high-ranking journal (Reference\u000a      4). The finding from the study of a 40% prevalence in allergy generated\u000a      interest from the Chief\u000a      Medical Officer for the British Olympic Team and the team doctor for UK\u000a      Athletics. This has\u000a      resulted in the implementation of a Healthy Airways programme for the\u000a      Olympic athletes in the lead\u000a      up to the London Olympic Games. The programme aims to identify \"at risk\"\u000a      athletes and develop\u000a      appropriate treatment and management plans. Ansley and Robson-Ansley\u000a      formulated the\u000a      screening process, which involved Robson-Ansley training up the sport\u000a      federations' doctors in\u000a      allergy skin-prick testing and Ansley authoring the asthma section in the\u000a      Athlete Health Guide that\u000a      was given to all the British Olympic track and field athletes prior to the\u000a      London Olympic Games.\u000a      As part of the Sport Asthma consultancy Ansley designed a novel EVH\u000a      testing device that is five\u000a      times more cost-effective than the traditional equipment and easily\u000a      portable in a briefcase allowing\u000a      testing at sports clubs and training facilities, unlike the old method,\u000a      which requires testing to be\u000a      conducted in a laboratory. Ansley has sold four EVH devices; to Exeter\u000a      University, Liverpool John\u000a      Moore's University, St George's University Hospital London and Gloucester\u000a      University.

Therefore, objective\u000a      bronchoprovocation testing is\u000a      necessary to obtain a secure diagnosis of EIA.\u000a    In 2007 Dr Les Ansley (Reader, employed at Northumbria from Sept 2007)\u000a      looked at the guideline\u000a      recommendations for performing an objective laboratory exercise test to\u000a      diagnose for EIA. Ansley\u000a      concluded that the usefulness of the guidelines was limited because of\u000a      their poor predictive value\u000a      in determining the correct intensity at which to perform the exercise\u000a      challenge. These findings were\u000a      presented at the annual conference of the European Respiratory Society\u000a      (2007) and received the\u000a      Young Scientist Award. Ansley subsequently designed and validated a heart\u000a      rate-based prediction\u000a      equation for determining the target intensity during an exercise\u000a      challenge. When this was\u000a      presented at the 2010 annual congress for the European Academy of Allergy\u000a      and Clinical\u000a      Immunology it won the thematic session for \"Asthma: exercise and\u000a      management\".\u000a    Ansley also evaluated the efficacy of implementing a screening programme\u000a      for EIA in athletes\u000a      using objective testing by employing the standard framework used when\u000a      evaluating any screening\u000a      policy. Ansley concluded that the adoption of a standardised testing\u000a      procedure is necessary for a\u000a      successful widespread screening programme; however, focused screening of\u000a      high-risk athlete\u000a      populations is recommended (Reference 1). Ansley has subsequently shown\u000a      that when a\u000a      screening programme is implemented almost 25% of previously undiagnosed\u000a      athletes have airway\u000a      dysfunction that could compromise their training and competition. These\u000a      data are being presented\u000a      at the 2012 annual meeting of the American Thoracic Society, which is the\u000a      largest respiratory\u000a      conference in the United States for respiratory physicians.\u000a    In 2008\/9 Ansley conducted the first ever audit into how physicians in\u000a      England diagnosed EIA. 257\u000a      GPs were surveyed via an online questionnaire with built-in logic steps,\u000a      which assessed the\u000a      diagnosis and treatment algorithm adopted. Rather worryingly, it was found\u000a      that the most\u000a      frequently employed tests were those with poor diagnostic value and that\u000a      85% of GPs had no\u000a      access to the recommended bronchoprovocation tests (Reference 2). Indeed,\u000a      when Ansley\u000a      conducted objective bronchoprovocation testing on 65 elite athletes who\u000a      all had a GP symptom-\u000a      diagnosis of EIA he found that almost half (49%) had been misdiagnosed and\u000a      were using\u000a      medication unnecessarily (Reference 3). Previous research had only ever\u000a      looked at under-\u000a      diagnosis, not over-diagnosis, for EIA.\u000a    On the basis of the association between exercise-induced asthma and elite\u000a      athletes Ansley\u000a      recently published a paper (Reference 4) proposing that exercise-induced\u000a      asthma might be\u000a      classed as an occupational lung disease. A change in the status of EIA\u000a      would have major\u000a      implications for clubs and teams in terms of duty of care towards their\u000a      athletes.\u000a    It is well known that the development of EIA is strongly predicted by\u000a      allergy (the \"allergic march\")\u000a      so in 2009 Ansley and Robson-Ansley (Professor) looked at the prevalence\u000a      of allergy in 210\u000a      competitors of the London Marathon. They found 40% of runners had allergy\u000a      but in over three-\u000a      quarters of these athletes their allergies were poorly managed (Reference\u000a      5). Unmanaged allergy\u000a      can have also potentially deleterious effects on cognitive and physical\u000a      task performance. Often\u000a      poorly managed allergy is due to lack of awareness of best practice.\u000a      Therefore, Robson-Ansley co-\u000a      authored a resource paper (Reference 6) to inform on current\u000a      recommendations in the treatment of\u000a      allergy in athletes.\u000a    Ansley and Robson-Ansley's main research collaborators are Hull and\u000a      Dickinson. Hull was\u000a      Ansley's PhD student and is now a respiratory consultant at The Royal\u000a      Brompton Hospital,\u000a      London; Dickinson is a senior lecturer at Canterbury Christ University.\u000a      Ansley and Robson-Ansley\u000a      were the principal investigators on all the collaborative projects.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35165","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The initial conference communications and press releases following the\u000a      formal publication of the research in 2012 has generated huge interest in\u000a      the popular press and most notably been reported on the front page of the\u000a      Daily Telegraph (Source 1), Daily Mail, featured on Breakfast TV and BBC\u000a      Radio 2 and 4, Dr Oz Show (Source 9). In addition, the information from\u000a      the relevant research outputs has been directly disseminated to:\u000a    \u000a      Previous and present National Director of Science at English Institute\u000a        of Sport (EIS);\u000a      Previous and present National Lead Performance Nutritionist at EIS;\u000a      GB Cycling physiologist, Regional Lead Physiologist and Lead\u000a        Practitioner for recovery at the EIS;\u000a      Performance nutritionists from GB Sailing, GB Modern Pentathlon, and\u000a        GB Triathlon at EIS;\u000a      GB Cycling and Team SKY professional Road Racing Team.\u000a    \u000a    As a result, these sports have used these products and have found a\u000a      positive benefit in recovering from strenuous exercise and injury. Of\u000a      particular note:\u000a    \u000a      GB cycling routinely use tart Montmorency cherry juice as part of\u000a        their recovery strategy on a daily basis during high training loads and\u000a        competition; \u000a      GB sailing, GB Triathlon and the GB Modern Pentathlon team use it when\u000a        travelling time zones and in heavy competition;\u000a      Used as an adjunct treatment of injured Olympic athletes in the\u000a        rehabilitation;\u000a      The EIS have now included cherry juice as an evidenced based\u000a        intervention in their resource guide for GB athletes.\u000a    \u000a    The use of this intervention has been directly driven by the research at\u000a      Northumbria and has been an integral part of the operations that has\u000a      resulted in recent Olympic and international sporting success. Testimonial\u000a      evidence from GB cycling confirms this: \"...we are utilising the\u000a        findings of your research and applying cherry juice as an intervention\u000a        to improve recovery and ultimately athlete performance here at GB\u000a        Cycling and Team SKY...\" (Source 3). Furthermore, many other sports\u000a      with high volume competition schedules have learned of the potential\u000a      benefits through dissemination of the research by the University and\u000a      popular press and ~50% of Premiership Football Clubs and ~80% of\u000a      Premiership Rugby Union teams now routinely use it and report a positive\u000a      effect on the recovery (Source 4). Also, numerous professional teams in\u000a      the USA routinely use cherry juice to enhance recovery and performance\u000a      that is based on evidence from our research. These include NFL &#8212; New York\u000a      Giants, Seattle Seahawks; NBA &#8212; Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers; NHL &#8212; New\u000a      York Rangers, Chicago Blackhawks; MLB &#8212; NY Mets, Seattle Mariners (source\u000a      Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma, NY, USA)\u000a      (Source 10).\u000a    A more recent application of the cherry juice in the management of\u000a      disordered sleep has also been extremely successful (Pigeon et al., 2009;\u000a      Howatson et al., 2012). In addition to using this intervention to assist\u000a      recovery, athletes have also implemented it as an adjunct treatment in\u000a      managing disturbed sleep from heavy training, return from injury,\u000a      improving general sleep quality and when travelling time zones &#8212;\u000a      statements in testimonials from National Lead Performance Nutritionists\u000a      include: \"... spontaneous self reports, from an athlete using cherry\u000a        juice daily after the IRU physio, training and strength sessions,\u000a        highlighted the impact on reduced DOMS, better sleep patterns and a\u000a        greater sense (feeling) of tolerance towards the following training\u000a        sessions over a two week time frame. This athlete believed this was a\u000a        contributor to his return to play, Olympic selection at trials and\u000a        participation in the London Olympic Games.\" (Source 2).\u000a    Interest in this functional food, globally, has grown enormously to the\u000a      point where sales have increased by two-fold for tart Montmorency cherry\u000a      juice concentrate (CherryActive) in the week of the research being\u000a      released. CherryActive, with over 1,000 retailers, is now the largest\u000a      supplier of Montmorency cherry concentrate and capsules in the UK. The\u000a      Managing Director has said the research has directly contributed to an\u000a      increase in sales (approximately 12 per cent increase from 2010 to 2011)\u000a      which was unexpected during a time of austerity and when the price of\u000a      cherries had increased enormously due to crop failures influenced by\u000a      inclement weather. This has resulted in a more sustainable future for the\u000a      business.\u000a    Many of thousands of people routinely use tart cherry concentrate to\u000a      manage joint pain, improve exercise recovery and sleep quality and also to\u000a      increase antioxidant intake; while it is not possible to completely\u000a      attribute our research with all these users, UK distributors have\u000a      attributed the increase in sales to the publication of the research and\u000a      the substantial expansion of their market (source from CherryActive). A\u000a      recent example of where the research has impacted on the wider community\u000a      is provided by Mark Allison who raised over &#163;100,000 for charity by\u000a      running across America in 100 days: he said tart cherry juice was\u000a      essential in aiding his recovery from day to day and he will routinely use\u000a      it to facilitate recovery from training and events for the future (Source\u000a      8)\u000a    The results from the research have also had a meaningful impact on the\u000a      wider community, where the application has been realised for numerous\u000a      people with disordered sleep, are time zone travellers or shift workers.\u000a      There was an increase (~two-fold worldwide) in the sales of Montmorency\u000a      cherry juice (Source 7) following the publication (Howatson et al., 2012)\u000a      of the research. The research was also recently featured on a Channel 4\u000a      series Food Hospital (December, 2011; Source 5) where a simplified on-line\u000a      public trial was conducted over a two-week period to examine the efficacy\u000a      of cherries in aiding sleep\u000a      (http:\/\/www.channel4.com\/programmes\/the-food-hospital\/).\u000a      Finally, a recent medical TV programme in the United States (The Dr Oz\u000a      Show, 30 October 2012) (Source 9) also highlighted the research conducted\u000a      at Northumbria and how the findings are being implemented by practitioners\u000a      and impacting on patients globally (http:\/\/www.doctoroz.com\/videos\/tart-cherry-all-natural-sleep-aid-pt-1\u000a      and http:\/\/www.doctoroz.com\/videos\/tart-cherry-all-natural-sleep-aid-pt-2)\u000a      &#8212; Source 10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Tart cherries are rich in phytochemicals that include compounds that\u000a      contain anthocyanins and melatonin, which possess antioxidant and\u000a      anti-inflammatory properties and consequently have the potential to\u000a      enhance recovery following strenuous physical activity.

Interestingly, many clinical pathologies (rheumatoid arthritis and\u000a      gout, for example) display similar characteristics of inflammation and\u000a      oxidative stress to those seen following strenuous exercise. These\u000a      exercise models of physiological stress, therefore, present useful\u000a      paradigms to examine the efficacy of numerous interventions that may be of\u000a      benefit in managing these factors.\u000a    Following an extensive review of the literature examining potential\u000a      interventions to manage the consequences of strenuous exercise (Dr Glyn\u000a      Howatson and Professor Ken van Someren, 2008), tart Montmorency cherries\u000a      were identified to contain high quantities of phytochemicals that display\u000a      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Consequently, it makes the\u000a      expectation tenable that this could be applied as a functional food to\u000a      reduce the negative effects of strenuous exercise by managing both\u000a      inflammation and oxidative stress and consequently accelerate recovery.\u000a      Until now, little or no research had addressed this question.\u000a    Howatson (Reader at Northumbria from September 2009) et al. (2010),\u000a      examined the extent to which muscle function could recover and oxidative\u000a      stress and inflammation could be managed by consumption of a tart\u000a      Montmorency cherry juice following the London Marathon. In a blinded,\u000a      placebo-controlled trial, the research showed that following a marathon\u000a      race muscle function recovery was significantly enhanced, which was\u000a      accompanied by a 10% increase in antioxidant capacity and a concomitant\u000a      decrease in inflammation and oxidative stress suggesting that cherry juice\u000a      ingestion accelerated recovery by managing negative effects associated\u000a      with strenuous exercise.\u000a    This was an important first step in demonstrating the efficacy of tart\u000a      cherry juice as a functional food to aid recovery by managing oxidative\u000a      stress and inflammation. In a further adjunct investigation (Howatson et\u000a      al., 2011a) the team examined the hypothesis that exercise-induced cardiac\u000a      troponin release was caused by oxidative stress following marathon\u000a      running. Despite there being changes in anti-oxidative capacity there was\u000a      no change in cardiac damage indices between cherry juice supplementation\u000a      and a placebo, thereby providing evidence that cardiac troponin release is\u000a      unlikely to be mediated by oxidative stress.\u000a    An often forgotten element of the recovery process is sleep. Athletes and\u000a      indeed members of the wider populations can suffer from disturbed sleep,\u000a      which may be due to travelling time zones, high training loads, shift\u000a      work, over-reaching and unexplained underperformance syndrome or some\u000a      other underlying pathology such as insomnia. Based on an independent\u000a      laboratory analysis that reported naturally high melatonin levels in a\u000a      tart Montmorency cherry concentrate, the team examined the efficacy of\u000a      cherry juice on melatonin levels and sleep quality and quantity (Howatson\u000a      et al., 2011b; with Dr Jason Ellis, Reader at Northumbria). Research\u000a      showed that cherry juice consumption showed a significant rise in total\u000a      melatonin and increased overall sleep quality by 5-6%. Finally, the team\u000a      have been awarded research funds (~&#163;200,000) from competitive internal and\u000a      industry sources to continue investigations into the applications of tart\u000a      Montmorency cherry juice in exercise and health paradigms.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35192","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The study findings of Abt, Siegler, Akubat, and Castagna (2011) suggest\u000a      that coaches and\/or athletes will need to adapt training methods depending\u000a      on the likely distance that athletes are required to regularly perform.\u000a      This knowledge has proved to be valuable throughout the sport science\u000a      field, contributing to incremental and cumulative advances in training\u000a      methods.\u000a    Akubat and Abt (2011) suggest coaches and\/or sports scientists will need\u000a      to adjust their training load recommendations depending on whether the\u000a      athlete is adopting a continuous or intermittent exercise.

Akubat identifies the limitations of those methods\u000a      such as rating of perceived exertion (RPE), Edwards Training Impulse\u000a      (TRIMP) &amp; Banisters TRIMP in his publications. He also argues that the\u000a      use of new technology such as GPS tracking devices cannot solely provide\u000a      sufficient, appropriate and accurate information on the training load.\u000a      This has led to his latest paper which shows the integration of iTRIMP and\u000a      GPS measurements is better than just the use of GPS alone (Akubat, Barrett\u000a      &amp; Abt 2013).\u000a    Research into the calculation of training impulse (TRIMP) in team sport\u000a      players following intermittent exercise concludes that the determination\u000a      of TRIMP from the change in the Heart Rate to Blood Lactate relationship\u000a      (derived from a continuous exercise protocol) may underestimate the\u000a      exercise `dose' of training and\/or matches in team sport players (Akubat\u000a      et al, 2011). As this underestimation is most prominent at the highest\u000a      intensities, the absolute exercise intensity and\/or the time spent at\u000a      these high intensities should be lowered if a given TRIMP is to be\u000a      achieved. Alternatively, if the absolute exercise intensity and\/or time\u000a      spent at these high intensities are maintained, then the actual `dose'\u000a      will be higher than that which is recorded.

The authors\u000d\u000a      argue that it may be\u000d\u000a      useful to examine the impact of modifications to judging criteria on\u000d\u000a      consistency in a range of\u000d\u000a      subjectively judged sports. The research is based upon two innovative\u000d\u000a      computational methods.\u000d\u000a      The first method compared differences in the range of the highest versus\u000d\u000a      lowest points awarded by\u000d\u000a      judges for each bout.

The\u000d\u000a      experimental repeated measures design involved ten experienced Muay Thai\u000d\u000a      judges observing\u000d\u000a      video footage of a Muay Thai contest in two different conditions: one with\u000d\u000a      and one without crowd\u000d\u000a      noise. The findings suggested that crowd noise affects judges' decisions\u000d\u000a      when officiating Muay\u000d\u000a      Thai. This adds to previous findings in others sports and points to the\u000d\u000a      potential for crowd noise to\u000d\u000a      contribute to home advantage through referee or judges' decisions. Several\u000d\u000a      explanations are\u000d\u000a      proposed that could help explain this, including informational conformity,\u000d\u000a      the use of a noise\u000d\u000a      heuristic, or cue learning where judges have previously associated crowd\u000d\u000a      cheers with a scoring\u000d\u000a      blow. Equally, it may be that judges' perceptual accuracy was compromised\u000d\u000a      by crowd noise, with\u000d\u000a      differing responses the result of unidentified individual differences.\u000d\u000a    Building upon this, the results of the Myers and Balmer (2012) study\u000d\u000a      suggest that crowd noise in an\u000d\u000a      ecologically and externally valid setting has a statistical and, to an\u000d\u000a      extent, a practical effect on the\u000d\u000a      judgments of Muay Thai officials. The results provide the first\u000d\u000a      experimental evidence of the impact\u000d\u000a      of live crowd noise on officials in sport. Overall, the combination of\u000d\u000a      experimental, observational,\u000d\u000a      and archival findings makes a compelling case for crowd influencing\u000d\u000a      officials' decisions.

Two specific examples are detailed below;\u000a    Rugby Football League (RFL): (2012-ongoing)\u000a      The RFL \"Embed the Pathway\" (EtP) programme was established in 2012. This\u000a      inaugural project (based on a major audit conducted by the RFL), is aimed\u000a      at the development of players aged 12- 16 years. In particular, this\u000a      programme aims to develop playing standards by improving coach education\u000a      (including psychological preparation) and curriculum delivery. The audit\u000a      by the RFL revealed that \"effective psychological coping\" is one of the\u000a      most important factors, along with skill acquisition, which often\u000a      determines player transition from academy to professional status. As such,\u000a      the cited research on stress and coping, and numerous other published\u000a      outputs by Nicholls and colleagues within professional rugby union, has\u000a      been instrumental in the development of the EtP programme. The Head of\u000a      Performance Services at the RFL (source no. 6) emphases the integration of\u000a      research into coaching development practice,\u000a    \"The research by Dr. Nicholls has been implemented into the Embed the\u000a        Pathway programme by incorporating psychological skills into training\u000a        sessions. We have incorporated many of his findings by training coaches\u000a        in how to teach coping strategies, so that players are deploying coping\u000a        strategies whilst on the field in training and matches to help them\u000a        perform better when stressed.\"\u000a    The research findings have been disseminated to all senior academy staff\u000a      of the 12 professional RFL Super League clubs (source no.7). The provision\u000a      of psychological care to athletes is a factor that will now contribute to\u000a      whether clubs retain their academy accreditation. The National Player\u000a      Development Manager will be assessing the ongoing impact of this work.\u000a    Rugby Football Union (RFU); (2006-ongoing)\u000a      The cited research has informed the coaching of both rugby union players\u000a      and coaches. The research identified effective coping strategies, which\u000a      have subsequently been incorporated by an RFU Academy Coach and the\u000a      England Saxons Head Coach. This individual is responsible for the coaching\u000a      of kicking across the RFU, from age group international players to England\u000a      first team players (source no. 8) and for managing the England Saxons\u000a      teams.\u000a    \"The aforementioned research has impacted my coaching in a number of\u000a        ways. In relation to kicking, since reading the papers in which Nicholls\u000a        identified effective coping strategies (Nicholls et al., 2005; 2006,\u000a        2009; Nicholls &amp; Polman, 2007), I have incorporated these strategies\u000a        into players' pre-kick routines. For example, I teach players specific\u000a        coping strategies and encourage them to use them in their kicking\u000a        routines.\"\u000a    This research has also impacted on the professional development and\u000a      coaching practices of RFU specialist kicking coaches;\u000a    \"A part of my job involves mentoring and running coaching sessions to\u000a        other specialist kicking coaches within England.

This enables other specialist kicking coaches to\u000a        include psychology in their coaching too and I know it has been very\u000a        successful in the development of players.\"\u000a    Furthermore, a report in the Rugby Football Union's technical journal\u000a      revealed how the findings of (Nicholls et al. 2009) were presented to\u000a      other coaches and how the club used this information to provide additional\u000a      support to their younger players (Source no.9).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research cited addresses the socio-pedagogical and psychological\u000a      aspects of sports coaching.

The\u000a      socio-pedagogical research was undertaken by Dr. Paul Potrac during his\u000a      employment at the University of Hull (2008- October 2013), in conjunction\u000a      with Professor Robyn Jones (Cardiff Metropolitan University). The\u000a      psychological aspects were conducted by researchers at the University of\u000a      Hull; Dr. Adam Nicholls (Graduate Teaching Assistant, 2004-2005 and\u000a      Lecturer, 2007-present), Johnny Bloomfield (Graduate Teaching Assistant,\u000a      2004-2006) and Prof. Remco Polman (Reader, 2004-2008).\u000a    This work was stimulated by the consultation document entitled `The\u000a      Development of Coaching in the United Kingdom' (UK Sports Council, 1999),\u000a      the Cunningham Report (2000) and by the formulation of `Sports Coach UK,'\u000a      which was assigned with leading the review and re-development of coach\u000a      education structures and standards across the United Kingdom. These\u000a      strategic developments highlighted the need for extended consideration and\u000a      visibility of the sociological, pedagogical and psychological aspects of\u000a      sports coaching practice within coach education schemes and ongoing\u000a      Continuing Professional Development initiatives.\u000a    The papers submitted as part of this case study respond to the above, by\u000a      outlining the socio- pedagogical and psychological complexities of\u000a      coaching practice, coach and athlete learning, and the psychological\u000a      stress associated with elite sport. The 6 peer-reviewed published outputs\u000a      (see Section 3) represent new findings and suggest alternative conceptual\u000a      frameworks from which complex everyday realities of sporting practice can\u000a      be understood by coach educators, coaches and athletes. Specifically, this\u000a      research has highlighted that the coaching process is not linear, nor\u000a      straightforward, but is instead grounded in the realities and\u000a      opportunities forged from human interaction (see Potrac &amp; Jones,\u000a      2009a, 2009b). The emphasis on the micro-political nature of coaching\u000a      practice in these papers has identified the need for coaches to consider\u000a      the character of their working relationships with key contextual\u000a      stakeholders (this includes, administrators, coaching staff, playing\u000a      staff, etc.), who frequently influence the time, space and resources\u000a      available to implement coaching programmes. Equally, this research has\u000a      also highlighted the political nature of coaches' engagement with formal\u000a      coach education provision. In particular, it has identified some of the\u000a      ways in which coaches may choose to fabricate their responses to the\u000a      ideas, methods, and assessments espoused in formal coach education\u000a      programmes (see Chesterfield, Potrac and Jones, 2010).\u000a    The key insights from the psychological-based research have been both\u000a      theoretical (underpinned by the theoretical framework of Lazarus) and\u000a      applied in nature. The research has generally been guided by the need to\u000a      understand more about the entire stress process in sport. This enquiry\u000a      involves the evaluation of stressors, feeling emotions, and coping in\u000a      athletes and secondly, to understand more about `coping effectiveness' so\u000a      that athletes can be taught how to maximise their coping efforts.\u000a    To this end, numerous outputs have been published by the group in this\u000a      area. Among these outputs, Nicholls et al. (2006) first reported\u000a      stressors, coping strategies, and perceived coping effectiveness\u000a      longitudinally among professional rugby union players during a key stage\u000a      of the season. Professional rugby players reported using a variety of\u000a      different coping strategies in order to manage the stressors they\u000a      encountered, but the effectiveness of their coping strategies varied.\u000a      Nicholls et al. (2009) expanded upon this research by examining emotions\u000a      in addition to stressors, coping and coping effectiveness among\u000a      professional rugby union players. Coping effectiveness was significantly\u000a      lower and emotional intensity was significantly higher during competition,\u000a      compared with training. However, players reported more stressors during\u000a      training than matches. The findings indicated that players should be\u000a      encouraged to deploy coping strategies during both training and matches.\u000a      Further, maximising coping effectiveness through coping training may be\u000a      the key to reducing the intensity of unpleasant emotions.\u000a    Adopting a more holistic approach than earlier investigations (Nicholls\u000a      et al., 2006; 2009), by measuring both sport and non-sporting stressors,\u000a      Nicholls et al. (2009) examined sources and symptoms of stress and\u000a      affective states among professional rugby union players. The findings\u000a      indicated that the players experienced multiple sporting and non-sporting\u000a      stressors and reported negative affective states. This research provides a\u000a      comprehensive representation of the stressors experienced by young\u000a      professional sportsmen. The `perspective section' of the output emphasises\u000a      that coaches and applied practitioners should recognise all facets of\u000a      psychological stress within professional sport, monitor stress levels\u000a      throughout a season, and teach players how to manage such stressors.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35571","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underlying aim of the research was to provide evidence-based\u000a      recommendations to improve clinical standards and patient care whilst\u000a      reducing falls in amputees and improving patient well-being. The knowledge\u000a      gained through biomechanical analysis has been used nationally and\u000a      internationally to inform and design appropriate and targeted exercise\u000a      intervention strategies aimed at attenuating the loss of musculoskeletal\u000a      function and reducing falls in lower limb amputees. The published works\u000a      described above have had a significant clinical impact on amputee\u000a      physiotherapy treatment and the revision of existing healthcare guidelines\u000a      and policies related to lower limb amputees in the UK and more recently\u000a      internationally in Australia (sources 1-10).\u000a    The 2008 audit findings revealed that 79% of lead physiotherapists within\u000a      the main Disablement Services Centre across the UK used some form of\u000a      outcome measure in amputee rehabilitation. However, there were no\u000a      standardised procedures in place on frequency and the specific outcome\u000a      measures (generic compared to population-specific) utilised. Moreover,\u000a      only 7% of physiotherapists audited monitored falls formally. These data\u000a      were disseminated by invitation to the 2009 BACPAR annual conference\u000a      (source no.1) having been published previously in their professional\u000a      journal (source no.2). Recommendations made to standardise the use of\u000a      clinical outcome measures resulted in the BACPAR Toolbox of Outcome\u000a        Measures (2010), implemented by physiotherapists nationally (source\u000a      no.3). Following on from the work done by Vanicek and colleagues (2008),\u000a      more recent independent research has examined the current use of outcome\u000a      measures by amputee physiotherapists, occupational therapists and\u000a      prosthetists (Queen Margaret University, unpublished doctoral research,\u000a      2012). The investigator comments (source no.4) that this study revealed\u000a      that all healthcare professionals surveyed were routinely using outcome\u000a      measures in their clinical practice.\u000a    This higher survey value indicates that healthcare practitioners are now\u000a      more aware of the relevance of outcome measures in monitoring patient\u000a      progress and evaluating successful treatment. BACPAR acknowledge the\u000a      contribution of Dr. Vanicek to the working group and are committed in\u000a      updating the present Toolbox of Outcome Measures (2010) to reflect\u000a      current and best practice (source no.5). Subsequent invited presentations\u000a      by Dr. Vanicek to the Australian Physiotherapists in Amputee\u000a      Rehabilitation (AustPAR), in September 2012 and June 2013, have further\u000a      disseminated recommendations on the standardisation of outcome measures in\u000a      clinical practice (source no.6). Head Physiotherapist at Port Kembla, NSW,\u000a      Australia (source no.7), reports:\u000a    \"Objective clinical outcome measures of walking velocity, Timed Up and\u000a        Go, AMPPRO, two minute walk distance and the four square step test have\u000a        become routine at our Rehabilitation Hospital. The feedback to the\u000a        patients on their weight bearing progress, and speed has encouraged each\u000a        new patient to progress a little more each day. I feel a great sense of\u000a        accomplishment as each patient fulfils their goal of domestic or\u000a        community ambulation with their prosthesis. Research in this area is\u000a        vital to clinicians who in turn have a direct impact on each new\u000a        amputee.\"\u000a    Several published outputs (Vanicek et al. 2009a; Vanicek et al. 2009b;\u000a      Vanicek et al. 2010; Barnett et al. 2009) make specific recommendations\u000a      for targeted exercises strengthening specific lower limb musculature and\u000a      joints during weight-transfer tasks for falls prevention. These research\u000a      findings have significantly changed physiotherapy practice in the UK and\u000a      internationally, by prompting clinicians to develop patient-specific falls\u000a      prevention goals. Head of Physiotherapy in Port Kembla, NSW, Australia\u000a      (source 7), states:\u000a    \"Australian Physiotherapy in Amputee Rehabilitation (AustPAR) has\u000a        progressed with Dr. Vanicek's research findings in regard to training\u000a        balance control. The early use of mobility aids as temporary \/interim\u000a        prostheses has provided the modifiable prosthesis while the stump\u000a        matures (Barnett et al, 2009)... The reported significance of hip and\u000a        ankle strategies for balance control (Vanicek et al., 2009b) has changed\u000a        my practice to devote more patient practice to hip extension exercise\u000a        with the patient in late stance, and more eccentric lower limb exercises\u000a        in preparation for recovery for a misstep (Vanicek et al., 2009a). My\u000a        patients have found that strengthening and partial weight-bearing\u000a        practice has prepared them for the whole gait practice and helped them\u000a        to develop much more trust in the prosthesis\".\u000a    Additional impact of the underpinning research is reflected in the\u000a      recently updated (2012) Evidence Based Clinical Guidelines for the\u000a        Managements of Adults with Lower Limb Prostheses, by the Chartered\u000a      Society of Physiotherapy, which makes specific reference to the work of\u000a      the group within their guidelines on prosthetic rehabilitation programming\u000a      (source no.9).

The work\u000a      derived from the collaborative efforts between Dr. Vanicek with local NHS\u000a      clinicians and healthcare providers examining the biomechanical factors\u000a      that distinguish transtibial amputee fallers from non-fallers and the\u000a      biomechanics and QoL factors of early gait retaining with EWA. The\u000a      projects were led by Dr. Vanicek, in collaboration with other staff from\u000a      the University of Hull, including Prof. Remco Polman (Reader, 2004-2008),\u000a      Prof. Lars McNaughton (Professor, 2003-2008), and Dr. Cleveland Barnett\u000a      (Ph.D student, 2007-2010). External collaborators included regional\u000a      Clinical Amputee physiotherapists (Amanda Hancock, Barbara Brown) and\u000a      vascular surgical Consultants (Prof. Ian Chetter and Dr. Patrick Coughlin)\u000a      from Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Hospitals Trust. Dr. Siobhan Strike\u000a      (Roehampton University) was an external academic collaborator.\u000a    A first study, an audit of clinical practice, investigated how\u000a      physiotherapists monitored falls and whether the use of outcome measures\u000a      in amputee rehabilitation was standardised in England. Shortcomings were\u000a      identified in that physiotherapists did not monitor falls incidence\u000a      regularly among their patients and that there was no consensus on the use\u000a      of outcome measures. Subsequently, Vanicek et al. (2009a) compared the\u000a      gait patterns of recent amputee fallers against non-fallers during level\u000a      walking to make evidence-based recommendations for improving falls\u000a      prevention programmes in LLA. This research suggested that falls\u000a      prevention and prosthetic rehabilitation programmes should focus on\u000a      targeting specific musculature of the prosthetic and intact limbs to\u000a      improve stability and progression, particularly during weight transfer on\u000a      to prosthetic single support. Vanicek et al. (2010) also identified\u000a      biomechanical differences in amputee fallers and non-fallers during stair\u000a      ascent, a more challenging task with greater falls risk than level\u000a      walking. The findings suggested the non-fallers performed mechanically\u000a      demanding tasks more cautiously. This group (2009b) were also the first to\u000a      measure postural responses to dynamic perturbations objectively in amputee\u000a      fallers compared to non-fallers utilising computerised dynamic\u000a      posturography (Neurocom Equitest). The findings revealed the Sensory\u000a      Organization Test and Motor Control Test protocols of the Equitest may be\u000a      population-specific and are not suitable diagnostic tests for reliably\u000a      identifying fallers from non-fallers in LLA.\u000a    Early walking aids (EWAs) are generic prosthetic devices that are\u000a      routinely used as part of amputee rehabilitation for early mobilisation\u000a      and gait re-education. In the UK, the two most popular EWAs include the\u000a      pneumatic post-amputation mobility aid (PPAM) and the articulated amputee\u000a      mobility aid (AMA). The latter, allows movement at the knee (in contrast\u000a      to the rigid construct of PPAM) and thus mimics a more natural walking\u000a      pattern during early rehabilitation. Previous studies had only evaluated\u000a      these EWA individually. The group conceived and undertook the HEART\u000a      study. This was the first RCT comparing amputees with different EWA during\u000a      early rehabilitation (namely the PPAM compared to AMA). Mazari et al.\u000a      (2010) were the first and only to demonstrate clearly that there were no\u000a      differences between articulated and non-articulated EWAs for clinical and\u000a      QoL outcomes in transtibial amputees. Barnett et al. (2009) reported\u000a      independently the kinematic gait patterns of amputees walking with the\u000a      EWA. Despite different gait patterns with the EWAs during early\u000a      mobilisation, the most significant gait adaptations occurred following\u000a      receipt of a functional prosthesis. Thus, amputee physiotherapists were\u000a      providing patients with the same level of long term care and clinical\u000a      outcomes irrespective of which EWA was available to them and their\u000a      patients.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36505","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    How research underpinned impact\u000d\u000a      The research underpinning impact, conducted by Hall and other\u000d\u000a      international partners from the PAPA project consortium, provided the\u000d\u000a      conceptual foundations for the design of the PAPA coach education\u000d\u000a      intervention programme. Impact was achieved as a result of delivering the\u000d\u000a      four year EU funded research project. The PAPA project involved the\u000d\u000a      design, implementation and testing of the coach education intervention\u000d\u000a      which itself aimed to improve participation motivation and indices of both\u000d\u000a      physical and psychological health in 10-14 year old children. The\u000d\u000a      underlying research identified why and where in the motivational process\u000d\u000a      it would be possible to intervene and have the greatest impact.\u000d\u000a    Research collaboration\u000d\u000a      The PAPA project was a collaboration between staff at eight partner\u000d\u000a      Universities from five EU countries, which, in addition to Hall, included\u000d\u000a      Joan Duda (University of Birmingham, UK), Bente Wold and Oddrun Samdal\u000d\u000a      (University of Bergen, Norway), Isabel Balaguer (University of Valencia,\u000d\u000a      Spain), Athanasios Papaioannou (University of Thessaly, Greece), Philippe\u000d\u000a      Sarrazin and Jean-Philippe Heuze (Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble,\u000d\u000a      France), Yngvar Ommundsen (Norwegian University of Sport, Norway) and\u000d\u000a      Jaume Cruz (Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain). The partnership\u000d\u000a      comprised leading researchers working in the field of sport motivation\u000d\u000a      whose collective theoretical and empirical research conducted between1993\u000d\u000a      and 2009 informed the design and implementation of the intervention.\u000d\u000a    Main beneficiaries \u000d\u000a      The PAPA project was designed to impact a number of distinct user groups\u000d\u000a      including coaches and administrative leaders in sport federations, PE\u000d\u000a      teachers, EU policy-makers involved in youth sport and health promotion\u000d\u000a      and young people across the EU. To date the PAPA project has impacted on\u000d\u000a      local, regional and national FA administrators in five European countries.\u000d\u000a      Impact on this group of stakeholders was initially facilitated through\u000d\u000a      representation on the PAPA external Advisory Board, where the English FA\u000d\u000a      Head of Coach Education was a member. Representatives from UEFA and WHO\u000d\u000a      also sat on the Advisory Board, enabling dialogue on strategies for\u000d\u000a      embedding the PAPA coach education programme into existing models of\u000d\u000a      training. Impact on the FA and North Riding FA was achieved through coach\u000d\u000a      educators who received PAPA coach education training. Coach Educators from\u000d\u000a      five European countries have been direct beneficiaries of the PAPA coach\u000d\u000a      training. Grass roots coaches were also beneficiaries along with 10-14\u000d\u000a      year old participants in teams competing in the five European countries.\u000d\u000a    Nature and Extent of Impact\u000d\u000a      The research has made a distinct and material contribution to impact by\u000d\u000a      improving standards in training for youth football coaches. The research\u000d\u000a      has guided the development of a theory based coach education programme,\u000d\u000a      including the development of a coaching workshop, written resources to\u000d\u000a      enhance professional practice and supporting web based resources located\u000d\u000a      on a dedicated web-site. Coach education training delivery and\u000d\u000a      implementation guidelines have been produced to support power-point slides\u000d\u000a      and DVD clips for the workshop. The research underpinning the project\u000d\u000a      influenced CPD training within the English FA, as the FA integrated the\u000d\u000a      initial training of FA coach educators into the CPD training programme of\u000d\u000a      each coach educator. In North Yorkshire three coach educators were trained\u000d\u000a      and eight workshops were delivered to grass roots coaches. Across the EU,\u000d\u000a      41 coach educators were trained to deliver the coach education\u000d\u000a      intervention. The research has also changed professional practice for\u000d\u000a      grass roots coaches. Across the EU, 112 training workshops were delivered\u000d\u000a      by FA coach educators and 1159 grass roots football coaches attended the\u000d\u000a      workshops and received training. Those receiving training were themselves\u000d\u000a      responsible for the coaching of approximately 8000 youth football players\u000d\u000a      and findings from the PAPA project indicate the trained coaches had a\u000d\u000a      positive impact on children's motivation and health behaviours.\u000d\u000a      Practitioner debate has subsequently been informed by the research\u000d\u000a      findings of the PAPA project, and various professional bodies are\u000d\u000a      utilising the findings to define best practice. In this case, impact was\u000d\u000a      achieved through a dissemination event held at St George's Park, Burton,\u000d\u000a      where members of the FA Education Department, professional coaches from\u000d\u000a      national FAs, representatives from WHO, UEFA, Sport Coach UK, national\u000d\u000a      sporting governing bodies and representatives from various sports\u000d\u000a      contributed to discussions on the implications of the research findings\u000d\u000a      from the project.

This work, and that of eight\u000d\u000a      international partners, contributed to the development of a\u000d\u000a      conceptually-based coach education intervention that was grounded in both\u000d\u000a      Achievement Goal Theory and Self-Determination Theory. Its specific aim\u000d\u000a      was to enhance children's motivation and Promote Adolescent Physical\u000d\u000a      Activity (the PAPA Project). The research by Hall helped to inform the\u000d\u000a      conceptual basis for the intervention. It specified how coaches might\u000d\u000a      influence achievement goals through the creation of empowering\u000d\u000a      environments that would aid in preventing disaffection, dropout and\u000d\u000a      burnout in youth sport. The research was influential in the creation of\u000d\u000a      theoretically based coaching strategies and the development of resources\u000d\u000a      that helped to promote adaptive motivation and prevent the emergence of\u000d\u000a      maladaptive motivational patterns.\u000d\u000a    Hall's research was important in the design of the intervention as it\u000d\u000a      examined motivational processes underpinning the exhibition of potentially\u000d\u000a      debilitating patterns of cognition, affect and behaviour. Specifically, it\u000d\u000a      focused upon how the meaning given to achievement through either\u000d\u000a      dispositional goals or perfectionism influenced debilitating outcomes such\u000d\u000a      as anxiety and burnout. Of the research referenced below, the study by Hall\u000d\u000a        and Kerr (1997) was one of the first to provide evidence that both\u000d\u000a      perceived ability and dispositional goals were important predictors of\u000d\u000a      state anxiety for athletes as competition approached. In a follow up\u000d\u000a      study, Hall and Kerr (1998) were able to further demonstrate that\u000d\u000a      a combination of low perceived ability and a preoccupation with\u000d\u000a      comparative or normative outcomes gave rise to potentially debilitating\u000d\u000a      levels of cognitive anxiety. In addition to the endorsement of specific\u000d\u000a      achievement goals, Hall, Kerr and Matthews (1998) also provided\u000d\u000a      evidence that perfectionism was an important predictor of pre-competitive\u000d\u000a      anxiety. The chapter by Duda and Hall (2001) from the Handbook of\u000d\u000a      Sport Psychology reviewed the influence of achievement goals on both\u000d\u000a      adaptive and maladaptive motivational outcomes, and provided both a\u000d\u000a      conceptual explanation and supportive evidence for the way in which\u000d\u000a      coaches may influence athletes' goals by creating either empowering or\u000d\u000a      disempowering achievement environments. Within this chapter, perfectionism\u000d\u000a      was also identified as a personality characteristic that appeared to be\u000d\u000a      motivationally paradoxical, suggesting that while an important energiser\u000d\u000a      of achievement striving, it had the potential to render athletes\u000d\u000a      psychologically vulnerable. The paper by Lemyre, Hall and Roberts\u000d\u000a        (2008) was influential in confirming those factors underpinning\u000d\u000a      vulnerability.

A further important\u000d\u000a      mechanism explaining the relationship between perfectionism and burnout\u000d\u000a      was identified in research by Hill, Hall, Appleton &amp; Kozub (2008)\u000d\u000a      where they reported that contingent self-worth was a critical mediator of\u000d\u000a      the association between perfectionism and burnout.

His research has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated to practitioners the importance of evaluations and the need\u000d\u000a      for both theory and evidence based practice. In 2001 he co-authored the\u000d\u000a      NHS `Exercise Referral Systems: National Quality Assurance Framework'\u000d\u000a      (NQAF). The importance of these professional guidelines is evidenced by\u000d\u000a      the Foreword from the Secretary of State for Health {A}. The NQAF has\u000d\u000a      influenced the planning and management of exercise referral services for\u000d\u000a      over a decade.

He has been a BASES accredited Sport and Exercise Scientist\u000d\u000a      since 1994. BASES requires evidence that its Scientists understand and\u000d\u000a      apply research findings {C}. His research positioned Smith to become the\u000d\u000a      founding Chair of York's Sport and Active Leisure Partnership (`Active\u000d\u000a      York') in 2003. In 2006 Doherty took over as Chair. Important formulated\u000d\u000a      policy over the Smith and Doherty period included the decision to focus on\u000d\u000a      HEPA, the need for representation from the PCT and the successful\u000d\u000a      application for recognition from Sport England {D}. As part of his\u000d\u000a      professional work Smith was Chair of BASES between 1998 and 2000. In this\u000d\u000a      role he had a major influence on professional standards, guidelines and\u000d\u000a      training through his work on accreditation and lobbying for Exercise\u000d\u000a      Science.\u000d\u000a    Smith has used his research to stimulate practitioner debate. Since 1993\u000d\u000a      he has written 14 papers for fitness magazines and professional journals\u000d\u000a      {E}. He has had 21 letters published ranging from The Times (03, 04 and\u000d\u000a      06) to the BMJ (2000). Smith &amp; Bird's research (2004) set out, among\u000d\u000a      other things, to provoke debate on transport policy.\u000d\u000a    HEALTH IMPACTS\u000d\u000a      Smith's work in Exercise Science has influenced CPD for Health and\u000d\u000a      Exercise Professionals and improved standards of training. In 1997 he\u000d\u000a      organised the first BASES conference with a health theme. This was\u000d\u000a      sponsored by the HEA, attracted 368 delegates, five International Keynotes\u000d\u000a      and 170 presentations. The abstracts were published in the Journal of\u000d\u000a        Sports Sciences {F}. He has given 72 research-informed CPD lecture\u000d\u000a      and workshop presentations.\u000d\u000a    Smith and Doherty's research expertise, in the area of exercise, has been\u000d\u000a      called upon to facilitate a potential change in advice and practice for\u000d\u000a      people who intend to undertake endurance events such as the marathon. In\u000d\u000a      November 2013 Smith and Doherty had a proposal accepted by the BHF which\u000d\u000a      will involve their convening two expert group meetings to produce a\u000d\u000a      consensus statement on chronic exercise and cardiovascular disease risk.\u000d\u000a      Funding has been agreed for (i) a BHF information pack, (ii) an open\u000d\u000a      access peer reviewed publication, and (iii) expenses and venue costs for\u000d\u000a      the expert meetings.\u000d\u000a    Doherty's research has developed practice nationally and internationally.\u000d\u000a      His work has enabled hundreds of rehabilitation programmes to provide\u000d\u000a      health services to patients with complex cardiac disease. His research led\u000d\u000a      to two position statements from the Resuscitation Council (UK). These\u000d\u000a      resolved concerns held by clinicians and patients about the risks of\u000d\u000a      exercise following a cardiac arrest or after having an Implantable\u000d\u000a      Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) {G}. This guidance, cited by the British\u000d\u000a      Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation, has\u000d\u000a      increased the confidence of clinicians in including ICD patients in\u000d\u000a      cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programmes. There are over 340 CR programmes\u000d\u000a      in the UK. Each has an average annual throughput of 500 cardiac patients.\u000d\u000a      As a result of this research the number of patients with a cardiac arrest,\u000d\u000a      ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure or ICD who can now access CR is\u000d\u000a      estimated to be 10% of all eligible patients (17,000 per year). This means\u000d\u000a      that potentially this research has had an impact on over 100,000 high-risk\u000d\u000a      patients over the last decade. The percentage of CR programmes that\u000d\u000a      actively exclude patients with ICD and cardiac arrest has been reduced\u000d\u000a      from 99% in 2003 to 14% in 2012 (National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation\u000d\u000a      [NACR] 2012 table 2, page 6) {H}.The impact is likely to be much larger if\u000d\u000a      international CR programmes are included. The exercise programme from\u000d\u000a      Doherty's RCT has been used at the Manchester Heart Centre since 2002 {I}\u000d\u000a      and York Hospital since 2004 {J}. The proven benefits from completing\u000d\u000a      exercise-based CR, coupled with an average completion rate of 500 patients\u000d\u000a      per year, per site, is estimated to have impacted on around 11,000\u000d\u000a      conventional cardiac patients.

Doherty, as part of the\u000d\u000a      Manchester Heart Centre (University of Manchester) research team (1999 to\u000d\u000a      2003), secured funding from a BHF Innovative Practice Fund [5] to develop\u000d\u000a      a fitness test and a new exercise training programme for this specific\u000d\u000a      group. The study was a success as there were no adverse events during 500\u000d\u000a      hours of exercise. The effect of the exercise programme was to\u000d\u000a      significantly improve fitness, lower anxiety and depression, and improve\u000d\u000a      quality of life. The trial which was published in Heart in 2003\u000d\u000a      [6] led to a policy statement in which the Resuscitation Council UK stated\u000d\u000a      that exercise was safe and effective in this patient population.

A systematic training programme was\u000a      implemented (Sept\u000a      2007 &#8212; Jan 2008) with 6 Health and Fitness Advisors (HFAs) and\u000a      theory-informed information\u000a      physical activity promotion booklets were developed and delivered\u000a      throughout the programme.\u000a      Regular meetings were held with the HFAs to provide feedback\/suggest\u000a      changes to the\u000a      intervention. Of the 1683 people referred to the exercise on referral\u000a      programme during the\u000a      recruitment period, 347 (20.6%) were recruited to the study with 184 being\u000a      randomly assigned to\u000a      the intervention arm. Results were disseminated via a report to funders\u000a      (April 2009 [3]) and a one\u000a      day meeting involving all Birmingham HFAs, Birmingham Exercise on Referral\u000a      Steering Board and\u000a      other key representatives from local PCTs (May 2009). This report led to\u000a      specific and enduring\u000a      changes in practice in the content, behaviour change approach adopted and\u000a      assessments utilised\u000a      in the induction consultations led by the HFAs. The report also impacted\u000a      policy, being described as\u000a      \"highly influential in preventing disinvestment and decommissioning of the\u000a      EoP scheme\" and with\u000a      evidence that it \"helped to identify the need for free access to exercise\u000a      facilities, a wider range of\u000a      activities and on-going support, which in turn fed into the development of\u000a      the award winning\u000a      Birmingham Be Active scheme (free gym and exercise activities).\" [4,5]\u000a    The systematic review on exercise in RA patients was cited (April 2009)\u000a      by the NHS Evidence\u000a      Service [managed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical\u000a      Excellence (NICE)]. Their remit\u000a      includes `providing access to authoritative clinical and non-clinical\u000a      evidence and best practice' to\u000a      assist people in the NHS, public health and social care sectors in their\u000a      decisions by guiding them\u000a      towards `trusted high quality resources.' The review has informed\u000a      recommendations on the\u000a      management of early RA provided by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines\u000a      Network (part of NHS\u000a      Quality Improvement Scotland). This latter impact is particularly\u000a      important given that patients with\u000a      RA have traditionally been advised by clinicians and health professionals\u000a      to reduce their levels of\u000a      physical activity. The review also laid the bases for the European League\u000a      Against Rheumatism\u000a      (EULAR) recommendations for cardiovascular risk management in RA\u000a      arthritis, which stated that\u000a      `evaluating the effects of lifestyle modification on cardiovascular risk\u000a      was added to the future\u000a      research agenda'. Such research work was indeed pursued in our controlled\u000a      trial of individualised\u000a      exercise training for individuals with RA, demonstrating, for the first\u000a      time, significant health and\u000a      welfare benefits not only in cardiovascular fitness, classical risk\u000a      factors (such as hypertension and\u000a      dyslipidaemia) and vascular function but also in overall well-being. This\u000a      work has also had a more\u000a      formal impact on practice in at least some areas of the National Health\u000a      Service in the UK. For\u000a      example, in Dudley, patients with rheumatoid arthritis are offered free\u000a      enrolment onto supervised\u000a      aerobic exercise provided by \"Action Heart\", traditionally a cardiac\u000a      rehabilitation centre. This is part\u000a      of their overall care package funded by the local NHS. Drawing on our\u000a      research, physical\u000a      activity\/exercise is now firmly embedded as a component of the early\u000a      management of RA in\u000a      recommendations by EULAR, the British Society of Rheumatology and the\u000a      American College of\u000a      Rheumatology (ACR). The National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) also\u000a      includes information\u000a      on the value of regular PA on their website. [6]\u000a    The educational leaflet developed by John and colleagues has, since 2010,\u000a      been freely provided in\u000a      the routine rheumatology outpatient clinics of Dudley Group and other NHS\u000a      Trusts from June 2013\u000a      onwards. The information contained within the leaflets is used by\u000a      rheumatologists as well as allied\u000a      health professionals. Within the on-going PA\/behaviour change trial with\u000a      RA patients, the\u000a      researchers conducted focus groups with key stakeholders to customise the\u000a      assessment tools and\u000a      gain further understanding of how RA patients view physical activity and\u000a      their reported barriers to\u000a      PA engagement. This information, and findings from a baseline survey\u000a      completed by more than\u000a      300 RA patients on the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society registry,\u000a      contributed to customisation\u000a      of the psychological intervention (June &#8212; August 2010). Additionally, in\u000a      terms of impact on service\u000a      provision, 8 fitness instructors at Action Heart Dudley medical charity\u000a      were trained to deliver the\u000a      intervention and (to July 2013) 54 RA patients received the autonomy\u000a      supportive one-on-one PA\u000a      consultations.

Research conducted in the School\u000a      focuses on\u000a      understanding levels and types of PA engagement, along with personal,\u000a      social, cultural, and\u000a      environmental factors that facilitate or hinder PA behaviours in two\u000a      specific hard to reach groups.\u000a      The first group, ethnic minority communities, has been served by research\u000a      that sought to quantify\u000a      and understand the behavioural patterns influencing physical activity and\u000a      sedentary time. This\u000a      includes a systematic review of PA and sedentary time amongst South Asian\u000a      women (Babakus &amp;\u000a      Thompson, 2012); and a research project focusing on barriers to youth\u000a      engagement in physical\u000a      education (PE), school sport, and physical activity in Muslim communities\u000a      [funded by the\u000a      Birmingham Advisory Support Services (BASS), Benn, Dagkas et al 2007-8].\u000a      The second group is\u000a      patients, including individuals with risk factors for cardiovascular\u000a      disease (CVD) and those with\u000a      rheumatoid arthritis (Duda, Veldhuijzen van Zanten et al; 2008 - 2013),\u000a      with research focusing on\u000a      the delivery of appropriately structured exercise and PA\u000a      promotion\/behavior change programmes.\u000a    PA promotion in ethnic minorities. Although ethnic minorities\u000a      living in the UK and other Western\u000a      countries are generally thought to be less active than the white\u000a      mainstream population, detailed\u000a      evidence on this position is extremely limited. A systematic review\u000a      conducted within the School\u000a      (Thompson, Professor of Public Health Nutrition, joined the School\u000a      September 2012) was the first\u000a      to examine all published evidence on PA and sedentary time (ST) amongst South\u000a        Asian women\u000a      (R1). The findings identified the limitations of previously published\u000a      research, particularly an almost\u000a      exclusive reliance on self-report measures that are not validated in this\u000a      population. Moreover, the\u000a      review indicated that existing studies are of relatively low quality with\u000a      only two studies examining\u000a      ST. The research calls into question the use of PA and ST self-report\u000a      measures in South Asian\u000a      women and suggests that these commonly employed methods may not be the\u000a      best investment of\u000a      time and resource for community groups, local authorities and health\u000a      professionals seeking to\u000a      gather baseline information, inform change, or evaluate the effectiveness\u000a      of health promotion\u000a      initiatives.\u000a    The `BASS Project' (co-led by Dagkas, Senior Lecturer in PE and Youth\u000a      Sport, left the School April\u000a      2013) was funded (&#163;30,000) by BASS [School Effectiveness Division,\u000a      Children, Young People and\u000a      Families (CYPF) programme]. This project was a partnership between the\u000a      School and the\u000a      Department of Islamic Studies at the University, the Senior Advisor and\u000a      colleagues within CYPF,\u000a      and local and regional primary and secondary schools. The research was\u000a      commissioned in\u000a      response to Local Authority concerns about a growing problem of parental\u000a      withdrawal of Muslim\u000a        girls from PE in schools. The BASS project has two key strengths\u000a      that illustrate the School's\u000a      authenticity approach to research in this field: depth in\u000a      understanding the issues from the\u000a      perspectives of the Muslim girls themselves (n=145); and breadth\u000a      with contributions from a wide\u000a      range of key stakeholders and end users including parents (n= 32), head\u000a      teachers and teachers\u000a      (n=19), community groups and national associations (R2).\u000a    PA promotion in at-risk\/clinical populations. Exercise referral\u000a      schemes typically commence\u000a      when a GP\/practice nurse refers a patient, with at least one risk factor\u000a      for CVD, to an exercise\u000a      programme run from a community or commercial leisure centre. The `EMPOWER'\u000a      project (led by\u000a      Duda, Professor of Sport and Exercise Psychology; R3) involved testing the\u000a      effect of a 3-month\u000a      structured exercise on referral programme, together with a theory based\u000a      motivation intervention, on\u000a      participants' PA adoption\/maintenance and associated well-being\u000a        benefits (2007 to 2009). This trial\u000a      was funded (&#163;165,000) by and involved collaboration with the South\u000a      Birmingham Primary Care\u000a      Trusts, NHS, and Birmingham City Council. The intervention was grounded in\u000a      Self Determination\u000a      Theory (SDT) and entailed the training of health and fitness advisors\u000a      (HFAs) in the Birmingham\u000a      catchment area to provide one-on-one physical activity promotion\u000a      consultations. These\u000a      consultations were designed to be supportive of individuals' feelings of\u000a      competence, autonomy and\u000a      relatedness within their physical activity engagement. Results at 6 months\u000a      follow-up revealed no\u000a      between arm differences in changes in physical activity levels, but\u000a      differences in anxiety and\u000a      ratings of overall health emerged favouring the participants taught by\u000a      SDT-trained HFAs. The\u000a      findings provided partial support for the SDT-based intervention but also\u000a      indicated a need for: (a)\u000a      SDT-based training for all instructors who create the `climate' in the\u000a      gym, and (b) a post-exercise\u000a      programme `top up' consultation when individuals are commencing the PA\u000a      maintenance phase.\u000a    Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk for\u000a      CVD, leading to premature death\u000a      in 50% of patients. In our systematic review (R4) the researchers\u000a      (including Veldhuijzen van\u000a      Zanten, Lecturer in Biological Psychology) concluded not only that it is\u000a      possible for RA patients to\u000a      engage safely in physical activity, but also that PA leads to a number of\u000a      health benefits. Another\u000a      important conclusion was that the effects of physical activity\/exercise on\u000a      the risk for CVD had not\u000a      been investigated systematically. They subsequently examined the effects\u000a      of exercise on CVD risk\u000a      in 20 RA patients (R5). Results indicated that an individualised aerobic\u000a      and resistance exercise\u000a      intervention can lead to significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness,\u000a      and a reduction in\u000a      individual CVD risk factors, composite CVD risk, and disease\u000a      activity\/severity.\u000a    The physical activity promotion literature clearly indicates that\u000a      clinical populations, such as patients\u000a      with RA, do not engage in sufficient levels of PA to accrue health\u000a      benefits. Further collaborative\u000a      work, funded by Arthritis Research UK and led by Dr Holly John (School PGR\u000a      student; 2007 -2011)\u000a      assessed the educational needs of RA patients and health care providers\u000a      with respect to\u000a      lifestyle modification required for reduction of the increased\u000a      cardiovascular risk. This led to the\u000a      development and formal evaluation of public information on the health\u000a      effects of regular PA for\u000a      people with RA (R6).

Within the PAPA\u000d\u000a      project specifically and in collaboration with the respective football\u000d\u000a      associations (including the PFA, FA-Norway, Hellenic FF, Real Federacion\u000d\u000a      Espanola, and UEFA), 46 tutors were trained to deliver the Empowering\u000d\u000a      Coaching&#8482; programme in England, France, Greece, Norway and Spain. One\u000d\u000a      hundred and fifty workshops (2010-2012) have been delivered to 1367\u000d\u000a      grassroots football coaches across these 5 countries with over 13,000\u000d\u000a      participants [see source 1 below]. Further uptake (at the national level)\u000d\u000a      of the Empowering Coaching&#8482; programme is exemplified in a contract (July\u000d\u000a      2013) with the Football Association [2] to deliver workshops to Level 1\u000d\u000a      tutors, Tesco Skills Coaches, and Regional Development Managers and an\u000d\u000a      agreement with England Athletics (March 2013) to deliver the workshop to\u000d\u000a      15 youth development coaches. An Empowering Teaching&#8482; workshop was also\u000d\u000a      delivered to 30 Welsh PE teachers in June 2012. In dance, 5 Empowering\u000d\u000a      Dance&#8482; workshops have been delivered to 45 staff members from two major\u000d\u000a      vocational dance schools in the UK (the Royal Ballet School, Nov 2012;\u000d\u000a      Elmhurst School of Dance, Nov 2012 - Jan 2013), to 27 of the top Artistic\u000d\u000a      Directors and choreographers associated with professional dance companies\u000d\u000a      from around the world (DanceEast Rural Retreat, Jan 2013), and to 65\u000d\u000a      professional dancers from the English National Ballet. All workshops\u000d\u000a      stimulated practitioner debate on leadership behaviours that are likely to\u000d\u000a      promote or compromise quality engagement in sport, PE and dance.\u000d\u000a    There is strong evidence of high levels of satisfaction with the service\u000d\u000a      delivered and, significantly, within the PAPA project 428 grassroots\u000d\u000a      coaches participating in the workshop indicated on a 5-point scale that\u000d\u000a      they felt they learned how to integrate the principles presented into\u000d\u000a      their practice (score = 4.34). Impact has also been realised in term of\u000d\u000a      improved health and welfare outcomes. For example, initial quantitative\u000d\u000a      findings across the 5 PAPA countries (controlling for baseline values,\u000d\u000a      age, and gender) have indicated that players whose coach participated in\u000d\u000a      the Empowering Coaching&#8482; workshop found the climate to be less marked by\u000d\u000a      maladaptive features and had lower intentions to dropout at the end of the\u000d\u000a      season than players whose coaches did not receive this training (R2).\u000d\u000a      Empowering climates also significantly and positively predicted enjoyment,\u000d\u000a      self-esteem and objective levels of physical activity in young footballers\u000d\u000a      (R2). Focus groups (conducted 2010 - 2012) involving 86 English and\u000d\u000a      Spanish grassroots football coaches, who participated in the Empowering\u000d\u000a      Coaching&#8482; workshop, revealed that coaches changed what they did and said\u000d\u000a      when in interactions with their young players in order to be more\u000d\u000a      empowering [1].\u000d\u000a    In order to extend reach, details of the training programme have been\u000d\u000a      published in practitioner-centred publications. Examples include\u000d\u000a      \"Empowering Coaching: The future of dance education?\" in Dance UK News,\u000d\u000a      Issue 80, Spring 2011; \"Empowering Coaching&#8482;: A critical contributor to\u000d\u000a      the future of coach education in hockey\" in PUSH, 2012, 40, p 41 - 42;\u000d\u000a      \"For the love of dance\" in Arts Professional, Feb 2013, and publications\u000d\u000a      targeted at policy makers (EU Public Health Review, March 2012). Social\u000d\u000a      Media has also been utilised to maximise reach regarding the significance\u000d\u000a      and potential application of the Empowering Coaching&#8482; workshops. A website\u000d\u000a      (www.empoweringcoaching.co.uk)\u000d\u000a      has been developed with versions live in French, Greek, Norwegian and\u000d\u000a      Spanish. In addition, Empowering Coaching&#8482; has a Facebook page and Twitter\u000d\u000a      feed, and all web-based outlets host videos specifically created to\u000d\u000a      further exploit the programme, and also highlight the results stemming\u000d\u000a      from the PAPA project.\u000d\u000a    The reach of the Empowering Coaching&#8482; programmes and related research are\u000d\u000a      contributing to strategic discussions about fundamental changes to\u000d\u000a      professional training. Negotiations are in progress with The FA [2] and\u000d\u000a      England Athletics regarding the incorporation of the Empowering Coaching&#8482;\u000d\u000a      programme as a required element of training for all football and athletics\u000d\u000a      coaches working with young people. A Memorandum of Understanding has been\u000d\u000a      signed with the University of Valencia [3] and contractual discussions are\u000d\u000a      underway with this and other PAPA Consortium partners, on future\u000d\u000a      exploitation of the training programme for international sport governing\u000d\u000a      bodies.\u000d\u000a    Serving as a potential dissemination outlet for future programme delivery\u000d\u000a      in this country, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with SportsCoach\u000d\u000a      UK (April 2011)[4]. Presentations on the Empowering Coaching&#8482; programmes\u000d\u000a      and deliberations regarding future integration of this training into\u000d\u000a      coaching awards have been undertaken with a broad array of additional key\u000d\u000a      stakeholders.

Achievement goal\u000d\u000a      theory (AGT) which was initially developed in the context of education,\u000d\u000a      argues that the demonstration of competence is central to variability in\u000d\u000a      the quality of achievement striving, and assumes that there are two\u000d\u000a      different lenses through which learners can judge their competence level\u000d\u000a      (namely, via a task- and\/or ego-involved manner). AGT also points to the\u000d\u000a      importance of the psychological environment created by teachers (i.e., the\u000d\u000a      degree to which the motivational climate operating is task- and\u000d\u000a      ego-involving) for students' levels of task and ego involvement. Drawing\u000d\u000a      from Self Determination Theory (SDT), optimal engagement and well-being\u000d\u000a      are autonomously motivated rather than controlled. Greater autonomous\u000d\u000a      motivation is dependent on perceptions of competence but also the degree\u000d\u000a      to which individuals perceive their needs for autonomy and relatedness\u000d\u000a      (with others) to be satisfied. SDT points to additional key\u000d\u000a      motivation-related haracteristics of the social environment, e.g., the\u000d\u000a      degree to which it is autonomy- and socially-supportive and controlling.\u000d\u000a    A systematic programme of internationally-leading research conducted by\u000d\u000a      Professor Joan Duda and her PhD students\/collaborators at the University\u000d\u000a      of Birmingham between 1992 to 2013 (published 2001 - 2013) generated the\u000d\u000a      following outcomes which underpin the impact described in this case study:\u000d\u000a    In a highly cited (~ 500 times) theoretical paper including a review of\u000d\u000a      the relevant research (see R1 below), it was demonstrated that the tenets\u000d\u000a      of AGT are applicable to understanding motivational processes in the sport\u000d\u000a      domain. In particular, research was reviewed which indicated that the\u000d\u000a      task-and ego-involving features of the climate created by coaches are\u000d\u000a      significantly related to differences in athletes' motivation and\u000d\u000a      associated cognitive, affective and emotional responses. In a longitudinal\u000d\u000a      study (R2), evidence was provided regarding the psychological mechanisms\u000d\u000a      by which coach-created climates, varying in their task- and ego-involving\u000d\u000a      characteristics, predict athletes' reported well-being. Reflecting an\u000d\u000a      initial theoretical and empirical integration of constructs and assumed\u000d\u000a      psychological processes embedded in AGT and SDT, results revealed that\u000d\u000a      changes in the task- and ego-involving features of the motivational\u000d\u000a      climate across a competitive season predicted changes in athletes'\u000d\u000a      emotional responses (e.g., feelings of vitality) via changes in the\u000d\u000a      satisfaction of their basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy\u000d\u000a      and relatedness. In support of SDT, research has indicated that the\u000d\u000a      autonomy supportive features of the climate are also predictive indicators\u000d\u000a      of athletes' welfare via their implications for need satisfaction (R3).\u000d\u000a    Further integration between AGT and SDT is reflected in research that\u000d\u000a      considered the characteristics of the prevailing motivational climate from\u000d\u000a      the perspective of both theoretical models (R4). Extending this line of\u000d\u000a      work into the context of physical education (PE), the findings revealed\u000d\u000a      that perceived autonomy-supportive teacher behaviours, and to a lesser\u000d\u000a      extent perceptions of a task-involving climate in PE classes, positively\u000d\u000a      predicted students' need satisfaction which corresponded to greater\u000d\u000a      autonomous motivation. Autonomous (or self-determined) motivation was also\u000d\u000a      found to positively predict students' leisure-time physical activity\u000d\u000a      intentions. Supporting the application of AGT and SDT to the domain of\u000d\u000a      dance, subsequent research (R5) revealed that the motivational climate\u000d\u000a      created by vocational dance teachers corresponded to differences in\u000d\u000a      dancers' well being as a function of the degree to which their\u000d\u000a      psychological needs were satisfied.\u000d\u000a    In the contexts of sport, PE and dance, this line of research led by\u000d\u000a      Professor Duda points to the need for the development of theoretically\u000d\u000a      grounded interventions to promote adaptive motivational climates in these\u000d\u000a      settings. With respect to intervention approaches, the conceptual and\u000d\u000a      empirical advancements epitomised in the outputs referenced above (R1-6)\u000d\u000a      have highlighted the need for a more comprehensive and integrated\u000d\u000a      conceptualisation of both the motivational climate and the role of\u000d\u000a      psychological need satisfaction in sustained participation and associated\u000d\u000a      well-being. A description of such an integrative conceptual framework,\u000d\u000a      which draws from both AGT and SDT, and an account of how this framework\u000d\u000a      provides the bases for the development of the Empowering Coaching&#8482;\u000d\u000a      training programmes, is described in (R6).\u000d\u000a    The research described above provided the foundation for the\u000d\u000a      European-Commission FP7 funded PAPA project (www.projectpapa.org;\u000d\u000a      2009 - 2013) which focused on the delivery and evaluation of the\u000d\u000a      Empowering Coaching&#8482; programme across 5 European countries and involved\u000d\u000a      the development of a collaborative research consortium of 8 university\u000d\u000a      partners (6 outside the UK).\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers:\u000d\u000a    Professor Joan Duda: Principal Investigator in this research programme\u000d\u000a      and developer of the Empowering Coaching&#8482; family of training programmes\u000d\u000a      which has evolved via her world-leading research, funded projects and\u000d\u000a      applied activities in this area since the early 1990s.\u000d\u000a    Research Fellows: Dr Eleanor Quested and Dr Paul Appleton have\u000d\u000a      contributed to the customising of the programme for grassroots football\u000d\u000a      and implementation of the Empowering Coaching&#8482; programme in the PAPA\u000d\u000a      project.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38879","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Providing the Evidence Base for Policy Guidelines\u000a    a) Stair climbing interventions for Public Health\u000a      This pioneering research on environmental prompts for physical activity\u000a      contributed to the evidence base for policy guidelines on the use of\u000a      signage for stair climbing as a means of increasing lifestyle physical\u000a      activity at the population level. For example in the UK, NICE Public\u000a      Health Guidance 13, 2008 recommends: `putting up signs at strategic\u000a        points to encourage them (employees) to use the stairs rather than lifts\u000a        if they can'. Dr Eves' research contributed nine out of the twenty\u000a      three worldwide studies that formed the evidence base for this conclusion\u000a      [1]. In the UK, these guidelines were the first to identify the effects of\u000a      the environment on lifestyle physical activity. In the USA, Dr Eves'\u000a      research contributed to both initial guidelines and the updated guidelines\u000a      in 2010 (Centres for Disease Control reviews, Kahn et al., 2002; Soler et\u000a      al., 2010: [2]). Dr Eves' interactions with Robin Soler (head of CDC\u000a      Community Intervention Task Force in 2010) identified an error in the\u000a      CDC's updated summary of effectiveness, and changed Soler's understanding\u000a      of how prompts work and subsequent planning for implementation of policy\u000a      guidelines in community interventions [3]. Dr Eves' research also\u000a      contributed twenty three out of forty two effects to a systematic review\u000a      of effectiveness, twenty one of which were successful (Nocon et al., 2010;\u000a      [4]), a prominence in the field which contributed to the NICE (2008) and\u000a      CDC (2010) guidelines for PA engagement in the general population. This\u000a      systematic review relied heavily on Dr Eves work for its conclusions (R3,\u000a      [4]).\u000a    b) Nudge Interventions for Public Health\u000a      To change stair climbing, Dr Eves' research uses point-of-choice prompts\u000a      which are messages displayed in the environment where a healthy choice can\u000a      be made. These interventions, first used in 1980, are predecessors to the\u000a      recent interest in `nudge' approaches to health. They predate the global\u000a      prominence afforded to Nudge by Thaler\u000a      and Sunstein's\u000a      book, `Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness'\u000a      published in 2008 and the Behavioural Insights Team, known as the `Nudge\u000a      Unit' set-up by the Cabinet Office in July, 2010. Dr Eves was recruited as\u000a      a consultant for the Behavioural Insight Team at the Cabinet Office\u000a      because they were proposing to use messages he developed as nudges (paper\u000a      R4 above; source [5]). His research contributed approx 7.2% of the total\u000a      evidence base for a review on `nudge' and 45.5% of the evidence base for\u000a      physical activity nudges submitted to the Department of Health (UK) by the\u000a      Behaviour Change Unit at Cambridge (2012). This provides further evidence\u000a      of the way in which the research has informed the evidence base for\u000a      decisions at government level. It is premature at this stage to calculate\u000a      the hard end outcomes from this input into government decision making [6].\u000a    Influencing Physical Activity Strategies\u000a      Examples that predate the current REF period illustrate that Dr Eves was\u000a      one of the first researchers worldwide to investigate the promotion of\u000a      stair climbing and offer insights into the genesis of the impacts\u000a      reported. Dr Eves' research provided the evidence for nine out of ten\u000a      successful stair interventions in the UK at the time of the NICE review\u000a      and is the primary source of evidence that applies this field to a UK\u000a      population. In Catalunya (Spain), the Department of Health was developing\u000a      a lifestyle physical activity strategy and they sought advice from Dr Eves\u000a      who was working on a stair climbing intervention there with Dr Puig-Ribera\u000a      (2005). This resulted in commissioned research, the outcomes of which\u000a      directly influenced the content and method of intervention for the\u000a      Catalunya Department of Health's PA campaigns that were launched in 2010\u000a      [7]. Dr Eves is currently advising these policy makers on a new approach\u000a      to worksite campaigns (2013-2015) to be made available throughout\u000a      Catalunya, Spain, in which stair climbing prompts are combined with\u000a      food-related prompts in canteens.\u000a    Changing practice at a regional level\u000a      Dr Eves designed and installed stair climbing interventions that changed\u000a      employers' practice in local authorities in Birmingham (2008, 2011),\u000a      Coventry (2011), Walsall (2012), Dudley (2012), Nottingham (2013) and\u000a      Worcester (2013), as well as Severn Trent (2008), the West Midlands police\u000a      (2009), Pilkingtons (2011) and the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce (2011).\u000a      A combined workforce of 6,650 was exposed to stair climbing campaigns over\u000a      this period, as well as a significant number of uncounted visitors to the\u000a      targeted buildings. A published research paper on these workplace\u000a      interventions reported a 12.3% increase in stair climbing, demonstrating\u000a      that such campaigns can change employees' behaviour towards a\u000a      health-enhancing alternative. This paper also prompted Unilever to request\u000a      use of Dr Eves' campaigns for their workforce nationally and\u000a      internationally. In Nottingham, the public health department was alerted\u000a      to Dr Eves' research by academics in the national PA field. In addition,\u000a      he was recruited by John Lloyd, the regional manager for Heart Research\u000a      UK, to offer expert comment on a planned stair climbing intervention for\u000a      use by National Car Parks Ltd (2010). The modified campaign that was\u000a      rolled out was `very well received' by end users of the car parks in\u000a      Birmingham, Walsall, Stratford-upon-Avon and Manchester. Use of this\u000a      campaign is currently being extended within the UK [8].\u000a    Influencing Society\u000a      More broadly, this research has been picked up by individuals who are not\u000a      directly involved in public health and the implementation of physical\u000a      activity strategies, thus leading to the potential for even wider impacts.\u000a      For example, Rob Koelewijn from KLM Health services requested a paper on\u000a      the effects of stair climbing as a means of `designing the working\u000a      environment to prevent health risks' (2008) for summary in the Dutch\u000a      Egonomics Journal (Tijdschrift voor Ergonomie); a US school requested\u000a      permission to use our stair climbing campaign (iv) in their school (2011);\u000a      Chris Hammer from a `green' architect's collective in the US used our\u000a      research (ii) to illustrate the potential for reduced carbon footprints\u000a      for lifts (2010); and a website, InformeDesign, that translates research\u000a      for use by architects and housing specialists amongst others, disseminated\u000a      a paper on potential effects of station design on stair usage.\u000a    Additionally, Dr Eves informs public debate about the benefits of stair\u000a      climbing. He is on the British Psychological Society expert panel and is\u000a      regularly requested to comment on research in this area. He provides\u000a      information for journalists preparing articles on stair climbing\/physical\u000a      activity\/weight loss (e.g., Self, 2008; Country Walking,\u000a      2008; Men's Health Magazine, 2009; Slimming World, 2012)\u000a      and has given radio interviews in the UK, Australia and the US on the\u000a      topic.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Insufficient levels of physical activity are a major public health\u000a      challenge. In the 1990s, approaches to meeting the challenge of increasing\u000a      physical activity (PA) shifted to a focus on the accumulation of activity\u000a      during daily living and interest in the potential effects of the built\u000a      environment on lifestyle physical activity. Researchers from the\u000a      University of Birmingham tested methods to encourage the increased use of\u000a      stairs, rather than escalators and lifts, with the aim of increasing\u000a      calorific expenditure during daily life. This research made a major\u000a      contribution to the evidence base for NICE (UK), as well as CDC (USA),\u000a      leading to recommendations to use signage as a public health message to\u000a      increase stair use. Campaigns prepared for the Department of Health\u000a      (Cataluyna, Spain) were rolled out nationally, with advice currently being\u000a      extended to worksite campaigns. At a regional level, councils throughout\u000a      the Midlands have employed the stair use campaigns, as have the police and\u000a      commercial firms, with Unilever requesting them for use nationally and\u000a      internationally and an improved campaign rolled out by National Car Parks\u000a      Ltd.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3336901","Name":"Catalunya"}],"References":"\u000a    The evidence base for this impact case is located primarily in\u000a      international, peer reviewed public health journals.\u000a    \u000aR1) Kerr, J., Eves, F., &amp; Carroll, D.

During the 1990s, there was a\u000a      change in strategy to address this problem of low levels of PA.\u000a      Recommendations for formal sessions of vigorous exercise were replaced by\u000a      guidelines targeting the accumulation of moderate intensity PA as part of\u000a      daily living (American College of Sports Medicine Position Statement,\u000a      1995). Additionally, the focus shifted to the influence of the built\u000a      environment on lifestyle activity (e.g. Sallis et al., 2004).\u000a      Concurrently, researchers from the University of Birmingham were testing\u000a      methods to encourage the increased use of stairs as part of daily life.\u000a      Stair climbing expends more energy per minute than jogging, is readily\u000a      available to most of the population, and the activity can be accumulated\u000a      throughout the day as part of work, leisure and home life. The\u000a      University's research indicates that stair climbing interventions produce\u000a      a 6.4% increase in usage of public access stairs, with a 12.3% increase\u000a      recently reported in one workplace. An `overweight' man for example, who\u000a      climbs stairs in his home an extra ten times each day, expends energy\u000a      equivalent to 3lbs of fat over a year. Stair climbing interventions can,\u000a      therefore, contribute to obesity reduction efforts at a population level,\u000a      and it has been estimated they are six times more cost-effective, i.e.\u000a      value for money, than their nearest competitor.\u000a    Dr Eve's first publication on stair climbing (2000) was only the fifth in\u000a      the field, followed by a further 34 peer-reviewed papers. All but two\u000a      papers were first authored by Dr Eves or one of his PhD students [J. Kerr\u000a      (1998-2001), O. Webb (2003-2007), E. Olander (2007-2010), A. Lewis\u000a      (2007-2011)]. The selected papers below illustrate some of the\u000a      translational issues for successful interventions to increase stair\u000a      climbing addressed in this programme of research.\u000a    Output R1 explored effects of poster size, message content and context\u000a      for public access interventions. It was the first report of a) differences\u000a      in stair climbing frequency for different demographic groups and b)\u000a      different intervention effects depending on context (shopping vs. travel).\u000a    Output R2 introduced a new intervention approach. Messages affixed to\u000a      stair risers had twice the beneficial effect of posters. A companion paper\u000a      demonstrated maintenance of effects three months after intervention\u000a      removal. Subsequent research revealed that stair riser banners: a) are\u000a      more effective because of enhanced visibility (2005), and b) are\u000a      unsuitable for busy sites (2008, 2009).

Uncontrolled effects of building occupancy,\u000a      minute-by-minute pedestrian traffic and time of day that influence lift\u000a      availability are the likely explanations for this problem (2011).\u000a    Output R4 on a workplace intervention reported for the first time: a) the\u000a      use of stair riser banners, b) a sustained, successful stair climbing\u000a      intervention, and c) a demonstration of greater responsiveness in\u000a      overweight individuals than those of healthy weight.

Reviewers for NICE made the same error.\u000a    Output R6 generalised the multi-component approach to workplace\u000a      intervention developed in R4 to a public access setting (tram station).\u000a      Uniquely in public health interventions, the effects of this new calorific\u000a      expenditure campaign were only observed in overweight pedestrians.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38880","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research insights that support this impact case study have been\u000a      extensively disseminated to scientific audiences through traditional means\u000a      since 2004 (e.g., international conferences and peer-reviewed academic\u000a      publications). This is the primary mechanism by which the research\u000a      informed the two major impacts as described below:\u000a    a) Impact on expert sport nutrition recommendations for athletes\u000a    Until the publication of the research insights described herein,\u000a      consensus agreement was that in order to optimise performance, endurance\u000a      athletes should consume carbohydrate during exercise at rates between\u000a      30-60 g per hour (i.e., 0.5 - 1.0 g\/min). Such a recommendation was\u000a      provided by multiple authoritative sources, including the American College\u000a      of Sport Medicine Position Stand on Nutrition and Athletic Performance\u000a      (2009) and the International Olympic Committee Consensus on Nutrition for\u000a      Sport (2004). It was based on evidence that the utilisation of ingested\u000a      carbohydrates during exercise was limited to ~ 1 g\/min, and therefore\u000a      consuming extra carbohydrate of a single transportable source would not\u000a      provide further metabolic advantages. However, the accumulating number and\u000a      consistency of new research insights highlighted above contributed to a\u000a      fundamental change in sport nutrition guidelines recommended for athletes\u000a      performing in endurance sports and this has received endorsement at the\u000a      very highest level by being incorporated into the most recent (2010,\u000a      published in 2011) International Olympic Committee Consensus on Nutrition\u000a      for Sport. [see corroborating sources 1-3] Specifically, International\u000a      Olympic Committee Consensus on Nutrition for Sport concludes (with\u000a      reference to endurance exercise): `As the duration of the event increases,\u000a      so does the amount of carbohydrate needed to optimise performance. To\u000a      achieve the relatively high rates of intake (up to 90 g\/h) needed to\u000a      optimise performance in events lasting more than about 3 hours, athletes\u000a      should practise consuming carbohydrate during training to develop an\u000a      individual strategy, and should make use of sports foods and drinks\u000a      containing carbohydrate combinations that will maximise absorption from\u000a      the gut and minimise gastrointestinal disturbances.'\u000a    b) Impact on the global sport nutrition food and beverage\u000a          manufacturing industry\u000a    Starting in 2007 and continuing to this day (currently 2012) the research\u000a      described in Section 2 has directly underpinned new product innovation in\u000a      the lucrative sport nutrition food and beverage manufacturing industry.\u000a      This research has impacted industry at all levels from national-level\u000a      small or medium enterprises (SMEs) through to the global fast moving\u000a      consumer goods (FMCG) industry. For example, the UK-based companies Torq\u000a      [4] and For Goodness Shakes! [5] both utilise the science of multiple\u000a      transportable carbohydrates in their product design and heavily use the\u000a      underpinning research in their marketing and materials. In the case of\u000a      FMCG, in 2007 Nestl&#233; SA launched an entire range of products (the C2MAX\u000a      product range, which includes sports bars, gels and beverages deigned for\u000a      endurance athletes) which is marketed globally under their sports\u000a      nutrition brand PowerBar&#174;. [6] The term C2MAX is derived directly from the\u000a      research undertaken at the University of Birmingham and refers to the\u000a      presence of two types of carbohydrate (i.e., C2, glucose and fructose) to\u000a      maximise (MAX) energy delivery to the body during exercise. Therefore, the\u000a      research supporting this impact case study has been of direct benefit to\u000a      industry and the economy via its influence on innovation and new product\u000a      development within the food and beverage sector. In addition, the\u000a      involvement of industry and in particular the marketing of new products\u000a      has facilitated the dissemination of the research to non-academic\u000a      audiences. [6] Finally, the manufacture of products utilising the research\u000a      insights generated at the University of Birmingham enables both\u000a      recreational and serious athletes globally to optimise their endurance\u000a      performance through access to the very best research-driven nutrition\u000a      products.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study relates to the optimisation of endurance performance in\u000a      athletes through the use of newly developed carbohydrate-based sports\u000a      foods and beverages.

Such products typically provide glucose-only based\u000a      carbohydrate forms (e.g., glucose, maltodextrin) which can effectively\u000a      deliver carbohydrate to the body for utilisation as energy when ingested\u000a      at moderate quantities (e.g., on average 0.5 - 1.0 grams of glucose\u000a      ingested during each minute of exercise [0.5-1.0 g\/min]). However, there\u000a      is a limitation in the body's ability to fully utilise the energy from\u000a      consuming glucose-only based carbohydrate forms when they are ingested at\u000a      higher rates during exercise; i.e. the utilisation for energy (known as\u000a      `exogenous carbohydrate oxidation') is limited to a maximum of ~1 g\/min\u000a      despite ingestion at rates well in excess of this (e.g., &gt;1.5 g\/min).\u000a    A systematic programme of scientific research conducted by researchers in\u000a      the School of Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Birmingham\u000a      between 2000-2010 and published between 2004 and 2011 generated the\u000a      following research insights that underpin the impact described in this\u000a      case study:\u000a    a. The utilisation of ingested carbohydrate during exercise can be\u000a        increased by up to 65% by consuming `multiple-transportable\u000a        carbohydrates'\u000a    It was demonstrated that the limitation to the oxidation of glucose-only\u000a      carbohydrates at 1.0 g\/min could be overcome by co-ingesting a fructose\u000a      containing carbohydrate source (e.g., fructose, sucrose) with glucose (see\u000a      outputs R1 and R2 below). In fact, in one study co-ingestion of very large\u000a      quantities of glucose + fructose (2.4 g\/min in a 1:1 ratio) during\u000a      exercise resulted in 65% greater exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates\u000a      than ingestion of glucose only with peak oxidation rates of 1.75 g\/min\u000a      reached, far in excess of the previously accepted 1.0 g\/min limit to\u000a      exogenous carbohydrate oxidation (R3). The results were confirmed in a\u000a      comprehensive collection of further studies (summarized in R4) and have\u000a      been extended to many food forms (drinks, sports bars, energy gels).\u000a      Glucose is absorbed in the intestine through a sodium-dependent glucose\u000a      transporter protein called SGLT1, which may become saturated at high rates\u000a      of glucose ingestion. Fructose is another carbohydrate type but its\u000a      absorption is not affected by SGLT1 saturation, because fructose is\u000a      absorbed by a different intestinal transporter (GLUT5). Thus, the results\u000a      of high exogenous carbohydrate oxidation with glucose and fructose\u000a      ingestion were attributed to the stimulation of multiple transport\u000a      mechanisms for absorption in the intestine (hence the term `multiple\u000a      transportable carbohydrates') facilitating greater total carbohydrate\u000a      delivery to the bloodstream for oxidation during exercise.\u000a    b. Fluid delivery during exercise is also enhanced with the\u000a          ingestion of `multiple-transportable carbohydrates'\u000a    In addition to enhancing exogenous carbohydrate oxidation during\u000a      exercise, the ingestion of drinks containing multiple transportable\u000a      carbohydrates was shown to be more beneficial for the emptying of fluid\u000a      from the stomach and delivery of fluid to the bloodstream than\u000a      glucose-only carbohydrate drinks (R5). This indicates these multiple\u000a      carbohydrate-containing beverages have advantages in terms of energy\u000a      provision and hydration during prolonged exercise and should therefore\u000a      offer superior outcomes for exercise performance.\u000a    c. The ingestion of `multiple-transportable carbohydrates' can\u000a          improve prolonged endurance performance by 8% over glucose-only based\u000a          carbohydrate forms\u000a    The superiority of multiple transportable carbohydrates for endurance\u000a      performance was shown in a study demonstrating that consuming glucose +\u000a      fructose drinks during prolonged exercise improved exercise performance by\u000a      ~8% over consuming glucose only drinks. This was in addition to the 11%\u000a      benefit glucose only provided over water, so the total benefit of glucose\u000a      + fructose over water was 19% (R6). This study provided evidence that by\u000a      overcoming the limitations to ingested carbohydrate delivery during\u000a      exercise it is possible to provide additional performance benefits to\u000a      athletes.\u000a    Key Researchers:\u000a    \u000a      Professor Asker Jeukendrup: was the Principal Investigator in this\u000a        research program.

With CLBP currently\u000a      costing the world's economy billions of pounds through loss of workforce\u000a      in the form of absenteeism, this is most certainly an area that is\u000a      important to address.

This will have impact for the manner in which practitioners\u000a      deal with those with chronic low back pain in relation to how they either\u000a      rehabilitate or try to prevent low back pain with prehabilitation. This is\u000a      of particular importance considering the method suggested by the research\u000a      team is to isolate the muscles of the low back whilst training where the\u000a      majority of the world's training and rehabilitation professionals prefer\u000a      to not isolate when exercising.

However the relationship between strength\u000a      training and chronic lower back pain has remained ambiguous, without clear\u000a      guidance on appropriateness or application. The research team through\u000a      their scholarly activity have attempted to address the issue of confusion\u000a      through quality research and develop a strategic approach to training with\u000a      groups who suffer from CLBP.\u000a    Momentary Muscular Failure (MMF) and Chronic Lower Back Pain\u000a      The paper by Fisher et al (2012) challenges many of the approaches to\u000a      conventional strength training building on previous work undertaken by\u000a      Smith and Bruce-Low in 2004. The use of training to momentary muscular\u000a      fatigue enhances training efficiency as well as strength gains and is the\u000a      salient point covered in this article. Conditioning the muscles of the\u000a      lower back (erector spinae and multifidus) using MMF, through specific\u000a      lumbar extension exercise (as highlighted through the work of Fisher et\u000a      al, 2011; Fisher et al, 2012; Bruce-Low et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2011;\u000a      Steele et al, 2013; Steele et al, 2013a and Steele et al, 2013b) halts\u000a      deconditioning of these muscles which in turn reduced the risk for low\u000a      back injury and pain (Steele et al, 2013b).\u000a    Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP)\u000a      As low back pain is one of the leading causes of work absenteeism around\u000a      the world and is therefore considered a major international problem with\u000a      escalating costs in the billions of pounds (&#163;10.6 billion in 1998 which\u000a      has only escalated since). In the UK, up to 50 million working days are\u000a      lost each year as a result of individuals suffering from lower back pain,\u000a      with 20 % (1 in 5) of the UK reporting back pain to their general\u000a      practitioner (Bruce-Low et al, 2012). Therefore, a greater understanding\u000a      of how to implement interventions to reduce CLBP would be extremely\u000a      valuable socially and financially.\u000a    Therefore, using the training intervention of MMF, this research has\u000a      potential for huge impact for helping to reduce one of the world's leading\u000a      causes of absenteeism.

Its reach over the decade of its development has been\u000a      into the cultural fissures of Ireland and Israel, and other countries. Its\u000a      significance lies in the way it reveals how, if carefully managed, sport\u000a      can foster intercultural understanding and harmony.\u000a    Changing the policies of sporting organisations: The Israeli\u000a      Sports Authority (ISA) has adopted the F4P programme in many different\u000a      locations. The Nazareth Manager of the British Council confirms that F4P\u000a      was recognised, in 2012, as the `flagship project' of the Israeli Ministry\u000a      of Culture and Sport, and that the F4P child-protection training programme\u000a      has been adopted as policy by the ISA, where previously no such procedures\u000a      were in place (source 5.1). Support from sports and education\u000a      policymakers, and evaluative action research reports and reviews, have\u000a      enabled coaches to independently initiate and plan cross-community\u000a      activities in football and other sporting arenas. In 2012, ISA and F4P\u000a      partners agreed that communities themselves would in future own the\u000a      programme and deliver it independently within their communities. In 2013 a\u000a      new NGO, Sport Unites, began working with the ISA, inheriting and adapting\u000a      the F4P model for a broader application beyond football, in the newly\u000a      named Sport 4 Life project.\u000a    The Director of Football Development at the Irish Football Association\u000a      (IFA) described his experience of F4P as `eye-opening' in relation to\u000a      values of inclusion, basing the IFA's grassroots programmes `on the values\u000a      and principles of Football 4 Peace, embedding these values in coaching\u000a      reaching thousands of children throughout Northern Ireland' (5.2). The\u000a      Ulster Sports Academy observed in 2013 that: `The University of Brighton\u000a      maintains the overarching leadership of Football 4 Peace\u000a      International...It has been the connection to other programmes overseas\u000a      pioneering the development of the methodology, curriculum and training'\u000a      (5.3).\u000a    The Head of International Relations at The Football Association (England)\u000a      has observed that F4P shows how `football can be used as a vehicle to\u000a      bring people and communities together' matching the FA's vision of `using\u000a      the power of football to build a better future'; its emphasis on\u000a      `teachable moments' has been adopted at grassroots level by the Derby\u000a      County (Football Club) Community Trust, for example, to engage\u000a      disaffiliated youth (5.6).\u000a    Social change through intercultural understanding and challenging\u000a        cultural prejudice: In Israel over 8,000 children from 40 Arab and\u000a      Jewish communities benefited from F4P. In 2009 Sir Bobby Charlton and the\u000a      Manchester United Foundation sent coaches out to be trained and to\u000a      volunteer in Israel. He reported on this as follows: `Using football to\u000a      bring different people together is an approach that we endorse as part of\u000a      our community outreach at Manchester United. I am delighted to be\u000a      extending this philosophy to Israel. It is a privilege to be working with\u000a      Arab and Jewish youngsters and to be a part of Football 4 Peace project'\u000a      (5.4). In 2012, over 1,000 children were involved in activities and 230\u000a      coaches and community leaders in Israel have been trained, cascading\u000a      training locally to create a national network. Over 200 volunteer student\u000a      coaches from the UK have travelled to Israel to work with Jewish and Arab\u000a      children, alongside volunteers from Germany. Support and mentoring enables\u000a      15 locally planned events each year.\u000a    The British Council, (5.1) writes: `In 10 years Football 4 Peace reached\u000a      children, coaches and community leaders throughout Israel and has become\u000a      the leading cross-community sports project.` In November 2011, the Israeli\u000a      Sports Minister, Limor Livnat, addressing a public conference of\u000a      international sports professionals, talked of F4P's work in bringing\u000a      Jewish and Arab children together with Palestinian and Jordanian children:\u000a      `In ten years of activity, amazing and wonderful experiences were\u000a      accomplished and strong ties and friendships were established between\u000a      children that are different from each other almost on any parameter &#8212;\u000a      language, (ethnic) origin, nationality &#8212; but share together their love of\u000a      football ... one cannot exaggerate the importance of these experiences in\u000a      reducing stereotypes and fostering good neighbourhood and brotherhood in a\u000a      place where once ignorance and fear thrived. Thanks to some of our actions\u000a      we were already able to implement we can already see the results on the\u000a      ground' (5.5).\u000a    Transforming citizens into ambassadors for peace: In 2010, the\u000a      model was implemented in Palestine (100 children and 8 coaches) and Jordan\u000a      (300 children and 16 coaches). It has been adopted in the Republic of\u000a      Ireland and Northern Ireland, where the Pilot Programme (`Gateway'\u000a      project) involved ten schools. Renamed F4P Ireland in 2008, the scheme\u000a      involved a further 11 schools in the first three years of the full\u000a      project, with 15 clubs and 60 coaches. In 2013, in collaboration with the\u000a      University of Ulster and Derry City Council, F4P ran an international\u000a      residential training camp for 90 participants (5.10, 5.11).\u000a    In collaboration with the University of Johannesburg, the F4P model has\u000a      also been adapted and adopted in South Africa (5.7); in Jordan, a new NGO\u000a      based on the F4P model was established, working in partnership with the\u000a      Scouts Association for the development of values-based coach education,\u000a      and focusing upon relations between indigenous and refugee communities\u000a      (2011\/12). In 2012, the F4P model was adopted in South Korea, by the Peace\u000a      Culture Institute in Korea (PCIK) and the Korean Sharing Movement (5.7).\u000a    Shaping political discourse: The high impact of the project in\u000a      political debate is evidenced in the F4P Director's invitation to the UK\u000a      Prime Minister's dinner\/reception at 10 Downing Street (December 2009), on\u000a      the visit of Israel's President Shimon Peres. The profile of our F4P work\u000a      was further enhanced through the endorsement of the President of the\u000a      Republic of Ireland Michael D. Higgins when he visited a F4P international\u000a      training camp in Derry\/Londonderry in March 2013, hosted by Football4Peace\u000a      Ireland as part of the City's programme of events as UK City of Culture\u000a      2013. The F4P Project Director has contributed to debate on the security\u000a      and defence agenda at NATO, in the context of cultural relations, conflict\u000a      prevention and resolution (5.9). Several film documentaries have been made\u000a      of the Israel F4P initiatives as well as one focusing on implementation of\u000a      the model in Ireland; many news\/media\/press features have reported the\u000a      projects, including a television feature in Korea (5.8).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research led to the creation of Football4Peace (F4P), which is a\u000a      vehicle for conflict resolution and peace building in divided societies.\u000a      By challenging cultural prejudice F4P has transformed passive citizens\u000a      into active ambassadors for peace.

SUGDEN\/TOMLINSON); Racism\u000a        and xenophobia in European football [reference 3.1], which includes\u000a      a chapter by TOMLINSON\/Fleming and; Sport in divided societies\u000a      (1998, eds. Bairner\/SUGDEN). This accumulative research identified both\u000a      the conservative side of sport, and sport's potential to provide the\u000a      catalyst for interventions in acute cases of social fracture and cultural\u000a      conflict.\u000a    Mapping: F4P was launched in 2001, initially as an element of the\u000a      World Sports Peace Project in Ibilin, Israel, in collaboration with the\u000a      Reverend Geoffrey Whitefield, who was a catalyst for the combination of\u000a      intervention, evaluation and research that provided the fulcrum for\u000a      sustained research and project development. As an activity based community\u000a      relations and reconciliation initiative, F4P generated evaluations and\u000a      sources for ongoing theorisation. In `Sport and community relations in\u000a      Northern Ireland and Israel' [3.2], SUGDEN compared cross-national cases.\u000a      The article demonstrated the core elements of identity building strategies\u000a      for effective cultural intervention, identifying the primary challenges\u000a      for sustained development and further implementation of the model.\u000a    Critical intervention: F4P was developed on the basis of a\u000a      distinctive model of values-based coaching anchored in an innovative\u000a      coaching manual rooted in core values: neutrality, equity\/inclusion,\u000a      respect, trust and responsibility. This symbiotic programme of project\u000a      development, research\/evaluation, and concept building confirmed that\u000a      sport-based interventions can challenge prejudices in tangible and\u000a      sustainable ways, facilitating co-existence within targeted regions while\u000a      at the same time embedding good practice within networks of coaches,\u000a      teachers and community leaders. These principles and initiatives were then\u000a      translated into wider spheres of educational\/cultural development via the\u000a      Ripple Effect model [3.3].\u000a    Impact expansion: The Ripple Effect model, advancing\u000a      systematically the insights and ideas of peace education theorist Gavriel\u000a      Salomon, was then applied in a range of sociopolitical settings. Arguing\u000a      that sport is intrinsically value-neutral, the model nevertheless shows\u000a      how, through partnership building and culturally sensitive and pragmatic\u000a      interventions, positive incremental contributions to peace building can be\u000a      accomplished. Drawing upon notions of critical pragmatism, left realism\u000a      and praxis, the approach illustrates the circumstances under which sport\u000a      can make a difference in the promotion of social justice and human rights\u000a      in deeply divided societies. F4P expanded its global reach by stimulating\u000a      and supporting initiatives in other regions of social and political\u000a      conflict (Ireland, South Africa and Korea). The model has been refined and\u000a      tested in further research rooted in international collaborations [3.4].\u000a      The resulting article, drawing on 30 in-depth interviews with stakeholders\u000a      and follow-on focus groups across 13 F4P projects, highlights the\u000a      intricacies and nuances characterising practice and implementation at the\u000a      local level [3.4]. Further UoB-based adaptations and research initiatives\u000a      have explored gender dimensions of F4P [3.5] and the persisting patterns\u000a      of racism in European football culture (BURDSEY and DOIDGE).\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a           Daniel Burdsey:\u000a          Lecturer (Sept 2004&#8211;31 Aug 2005), Senior Lecturer\u000a            (Sept 2005&#8211;31 Jul 2011), Principal Lecturer (1 Aug 2011&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Jayne Caudwell:\u000a          Senior Lecturer (Jan 2004&#8211;Jan 2012), Principal Lecturer (Feb\u000a            2012&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Mark Doidge:\u000a          Lecturer (Aug 2012&#8211;Aug 2013), Research Fellow (Aug 2013-to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          John Sugden:\u000a          Reader (Jan 1996&#8211;July 1999), Professor of the Sociology of Sport\u000a            (July 1999&#8211;to date), Assistant Head of School (Aug 2012&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Udo Merkel:\u000a          Senior Lecturer (Nov 1994&#8211;31 Aug 2003), Senior Lecturer, (May\u000a            2008&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Alan Tomlinson:\u000a          Lecturer (Sept 1975&#8211;Aug 1979), Senior Lecturer (Sept 1979&#8211;Dec\u000a            1983), Principal Lecturer (Jan 1984&#8211;Apr 1991), Reader (May 1991&#8211;June\u000a            1993), Professor of Leisure Studies (June 1993&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39772","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Safeguarding Paralympian well-being: UoB research on injuries and\u000a      risk factors has protected the well-being of Paralympic athletes by\u000a      improving how injuries are monitored, changing acclimatisation strategies,\u000a      safety rules and equipment design, and enhancing the education and\u000a      practices of clinicians working with Paralympic athletes. The findings on\u000a      pre-cooling in Paralympic athletes influenced the strategy for Great\u000a      Britain's athletes in the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. The research was\u000a      adopted in the acclimatisation strategy used by the British Paralympic\u000a      Association to safeguard athletes from heat stress in Beijing and is\u000a      identified by the English Institute of Sport as having impacted on the\u000a      sports performance of athletes during the Games.\u000a    Following the Beijing Olympics, the English Institute of Sport has\u000a      confirmed that this strategy has ongoing use within individual sports, in\u000a      particular wheelchair rugby and tennis (source 5.1).\u000a    Based on empirical evidence collected by WEBBORN at successive Winter\u000a      Paralympics, there have been rule changes for ice sledge hockey,\u000a      instigated by the International Paralympic Committee in the 2008 rule\u000a      book, which require standardised sledge design and the mandatory use of\u000a      protective clothing (5.2). The rule changes have been followed by a\u000a      reduction in injuries during the Paralympics and the eradication, thus\u000a      far, of certain injury types (5.2). Ice sledge hockey produced only one\u000a      lower limb fracture out of the 40 injuries (2.5%) treated in the 2010\u000a      Winter Paralympic Games compared with 4 of 12 (33%) of the injuries in\u000a      2002, before the introduction of the regulation change.\u000a    WEBBORN's research, along with his advisory roles to the International\u000a      Paralympic Committee and as Chief Medical Officer to the London 2012\u000a      Summer Paralympic Games, have ensured his findings have been disseminated\u000a      widely to clinicians. The International Paralympic Committee has\u000a      acknowledged that WEBBORN's work has made a significant contribution to\u000a      the Paralympic movement in relation to the education of clinicians in the\u000a      field, resulting in improved medical care. The injury study initiated by\u000a      WEBBORN in 2002 has now been integrated by the International Paralympic\u000a      Committee as a standard practice in all future Winter and Summer\u000a      Paralympics (5.3).\u000a    Improving elite athletes' preparation and acclimatisation: The\u000a      research on pre-cooling as a coping strategy for competition in hot\u000a      environments has also benefitted elite athletes. The findings were used by\u000a      the USA Olympic committee to guide its strategy for its athletes competing\u000a      in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games (5.4). The USA Olympic Committee's\u000a      preparation manual that advises coaches and athletes on competing in heat\u000a      and humidity contains four recommendations, all of them based on\u000a      referenced sport science research publications written by leading\u000a      researchers and institutions in the UK and Europe. UoB's research\u000a      publications underpin three of the four recommendations for cooling\u000a      strategies, including cooling vests, whole-body immersion and ice\u000a      packs\/towels. The manual notes the recommendations will help to delay and\u000a      potentially prevent body core temperature from rising to a point where it\u000a      impairs performance (5.4).\u000a    The Brazilian Olympic Committee has also acknowledged the importance of\u000a      the research, in particular the underpinning research publications [3.3]\u000a      and [3.4] above, and that this research is currently being used as\u000a      evidence in devising pre-cooling and heat acclimatisation strategies\u000a      designed to improve performance in the 2016 Olympics and Paralympic Games\u000a      (5.5).\u000a    Enhancing the training practices of recreational athletes: The\u000a      innovative findings of the sport science research at UoB have resulted in\u000a      improvements to the training equipment used by recreational athletes,\u000a      having a indirect impact on personal fitness. It has also led to changes\u000a      in the advice given to military personnel and people with disabilities\u000a      taking part in physical exercise.\u000a    The research by Jones and DOUST showing that starting a treadmill test\u000a      with a 1% gradient brings the same benefits as exercising outdoors has\u000a      contributed to personal fitness by changing how people are tested and\u000a      advised in gyms. Most treadmill tests of exercise function for fitness\u000a      assessment and personal training in sports and gyms use the principles\u000a      verified in this research and adopt the 1% gradient. The USA Navy refers\u000a      to the UoB research in online advice to navy personnel on how to maintain\u000a      personal fitness and recommends adding an incline of 1% when using a\u000a      treadmill (5.6).\u000a    Recreational athletes with disabilities are one of the target audiences\u000a      for the Peter Harrison Centre for Disability Sport, which has been\u000a      developing a `Fit and Healthy Resource for People with a Disability'.\u000a      WEBBORN has undertaken consultation and research activities that inform a\u000a      series of recommendations on which this new resource is based.

Dedicated laboratories were\u000a      established and equipped to measure human function in exercise and in many\u000a      sports, from rest to maximum effort, and UoB had one of the first\u000a      laboratories to have a dedicated environmental chamber. Environmental\u000a      investigations utilise the specially constructed chambers to control heat,\u000a      cold, humidity and oxygen partial pressure and focus on the application of\u000a      fundamental environmental physiology to the exercising human athlete. The\u000a      research has been characterised by rigorous analysis of the methodologies\u000a      and their application to the assessment and enhancement of sports and\u000a      exercise performance across different activities and environmental\u000a      conditions, for people of all abilities and those with disabilities\u000a      [references 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4].\u000a    Early work by Jones and DOUST [3.1] was the first publication to validate\u000a      a laboratory-based test to `normal' exercise performance outside of\u000a      laboratories. They showed that starting a treadmill test with a 1%\u000a      gradient effectively mimics the average outdoors conditions experienced\u000a      during running. People using treadmills with a 1% incline would,\u000a      therefore, be tested and assessed for their performance in conditions\u000a      similar to those exercising outdoors. This research informed the methods\u000a      and hypotheses of subsequent laboratory-based research at UoB [3.3], which\u000a      showed how scientific evidence can be used to improve the prediction of\u000a      the consequences of training and preparation in particular locations and\u000a      conditions for sport (eg, events in warm regions) and so enhance\u000a      strategies to improve the performance of athletes.\u000a    Broadening the field: Research at UoB has encompassed continuous\u000a      types of exercise and, more recently, intermittent sprint type exercise,\u000a      simulating the changes in pace experienced in field sports such as\u000a      football, rugby and hockey. Using rigorous science in sports-relevant\u000a      protocols, including intermittent and repeated sprint exercise, MAXWELL,\u000a      Castle, WEBBORN and WATT have demonstrated how improved performance in hot\u000a      conditions can be achieved by optimal precooling strategies, leading to\u000a      significant gains in work done in such conditions [3.3].\u000a    Related UoB research in Paralympic medicine started in the late 1990s.\u000a      This has extended the initial research further by developing new\u000a      understandings of the thermoregulatory physiology of novel situations,\u000a      such as those exhibited by tetraplegic athletes, who do not have normal\u000a      physiological control mechanisms for sweating and body temperature\u000a      regulation. The research has identified the appropriate interventions and\u000a      the best forms of support that are required to enable Paralympic athletes\u000a      to compete more safely in all environments and to perform to the best of\u000a      their ability safely [3.4].\u000a    Further Paralympic research involved large-scale multinational studies\u000a      monitoring injury occurrence at the Summer and Winter Paralympics [3.2,\u000a      3.5]. The research has revealed the complex medical and physiological\u000a      interactions that occur in Paralympic athletes, defining the patterns and\u000a      incidence of injury and illness [3.2, 3.4, 3.5]. The accepted model of\u000a      injury prevention first defines the extent and severity of the injury\u000a      problems and then establishes the mechanisms of injury so that preventive\u000a      measures can be put in place. Using this model, the International\u000a      Paralympic Committee has been able to work with sports federations to\u000a      implement the research outcomes. The research also demonstrated the\u000a      improvements required to better safeguard Paralympic athletes through\u000a      enhanced safety preparation for events and post-injury care pathways [3.2,\u000a      3.5].\u000a    Translation and intervention: The translation of the research has\u000a      been integrated with the academic research through key collaborations with\u000a      sporting organisations and participants as discussed in REF3a. In the\u000a      1990s, the UoB was contracted by four sports as part of the UK's Sports\u000a      Science Support Programme, to undertake applied research for sports\u000a      performance and assessment.\u000a    Research on heat cooling amongst Paralympic athletes was funded in 2003\u000a      by UK Sport to enable UoB researchers to work with the British Paralympic\u000a      Association to develop heat and acclimatisation strategies for use in the\u000a      Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Further funding from UK\u000a      Sport enabled WEBBORN to be part of a multi-disciplinary Beijing\u000a      Acclimatisation Group that, between 2006 and 2008, developed the\u000a      acclimatisation strategy for the 2008 Summer Paralympic Games.\u000a    This research on injury occurrence at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was\u000a      linked to the first Injury Survey conducted by the International\u000a      Paralympic Committee and was initiated by WEBBORN at the 2002 Winter\u000a      Paralympics. The survey highlighted that up to 24% of all Paralympic\u000a      athletes reported an injury during the Games. The success of this first\u000a      survey led the International Paralympic Committee to repeat it at the 2006\u000a      and 2010 Winter Paralympic Winter Games.\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Jonathan Doust:\u000a          Lecturer (April 1987&#8211;Aug 1988), Senior Lecturer (Sept\u000a            1988&#8211;Aug 1992), Principal Lecturer (Sept 92&#8211;Feb 2000), Professor of\u000a            Sport and Exercise Science (Jan 2004&#8211;to date), Head of School (Jan\u000a            2006&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Neil Maxwell:\u000a          Lecturer (Sept 1997&#8211;Aug 1999) Senior Lecturer (Sept\u000a            1999&#8211;May 2004), Principal Lecturer (June 2004&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Peter Watt:\u000a          Reader (Dec 2001&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Nick Webborn:\u000a          Principal Research Fellow (April 2004&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39773","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3355338","Name":"Namibia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2413451","Name":"Gambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"},{"GeoNamesId":"290291","Name":"Bahrain"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research and participatory methods have impacted on\u000a      policies that aim to address the lack of tourism and hospitality human\u000a      resources capacity, which is key to any nation's successful tourism\u000a      development.\u000a    The World Bank commissioned research into education, capacity building\u000a      and training in Gambia, which led to a re-designed education and training\u000a      policy. The research influenced the decision of the Spanish government to\u000a      fund The Gambia Tourism and Hospitality Institute (GTHI), a national\u000a      centre of excellence for tourism and hospitality education. The research\u000a      provided: a feasibility assessment (2009) and business plan (2011) to\u000a      direct policy, later implemented through `The Gambia Tourism and\u000a      Hospitality Institute Bill', which sought to create an enabling\u000a      environment for Gambians to study up to the level of a Higher National\u000a      Diploma in travel, tourism and hospitality. This bill was approved by the\u000a      National Assembly in 2011 (source 5.8). Drawing upon the University of\u000a      Brighton's recommendations, the GTHI was inaugurated in 2013 after an\u000a      investment of &#8364;2.7m. The GTHI aims to train an average of 200 school\u000a      leavers per year and upgrade the level of professional training amongst\u000a      the 30,000 workers in tourism and hospitality, a sector that contributes\u000a      16% to the national GDP (5.1, 5.2).\u000a    UNESCO-funded research in Nigeria led to a new national curriculum for\u000a      leisure, tourism and hospitality workforce training. As part of a larger\u000a      project aimed at revitalising Nigeria's Technical and Vocational Education\u000a      and Training (TVET), in collaboration with the Nigeria Board of Technical\u000a      Education (NBTE), NOVELLI produced a `Leisure, Tourism and Hospitality\u000a      Curriculum Review' (2004), followed by a `Capacity\u000a      Building\/Train-the-Trainers Programme' (NOVELLI and BURNS 2009). This led\u000a      to the adoption of new industry and employment-centred leisure, tourism\u000a      and hospitality teaching materials and a new national curriculum replacing\u000a      the previous redundant one, which dated back to colonial times. An\u000a      evaluation of the material and curriculum undertaken by the NBTE concluded\u000a      that the impacts had spread beyond Nigeria and that: `The tangible\u000a      outcomes of the initiative have been accepted for adoption in the ECOWAS\u000a      countries... Other counties outside the region, e.g. Libya, Bahrain,\u000a      Ethiopia, etc. have also benefitted from its achievement and have used the\u000a      curricula developed as part of their own national curricula.' (5.6).\u000a      Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) contains 32 coastal states, where unsustainable\u000a      tourism practices have already led to irreparable damage to fragile\u000a      ecosystems and significant economic losses. The United Nations\u000a      Environmental Programme (UNEP), Global Environmental Facility (GEF), UNIDO\u000a      and UNWTO have worked together to develop the Collaborative Actions for\u000a      Sustainable Tourism (COAST) initiative targeting the sub-Saharan\u000a      coastline. University of Brighton researchers were part of a consortium of\u000a      five experts undertaking research in three of the nine COAST Demonstrator\u000a      Projects. Research into `Best Available Practices\/Technologies' in\u000a      Nigeria, Gambia (NOVELLI) and Ghana (BENSON) led to the identification of\u000a      training needs and government guidelines for ecotourism development. On\u000a      this basis, COAST identified demonstrator sites and delivered, for\u000a      example, targeted training and local initiatives in the village of Kartong\u000a      (5.7). This research enabled local stakeholders to articulate a vision for\u000a      tourism development in their village and contributed to the community's\u000a      growing confidence in the future of that village. The process was\u000a      transformative on both sides leading to direct and indirect support for\u000a      local businesses, having far-reaching social and economic benefits within\u000a      the wider community (5.3).\u000a    The Gambia Ministry of Tourism and Culture commissioned the research\u000a      project GambiaHost that was aimed at the design of national\u000a      tourism and hospitality service standards to improve destination\u000a      competitiveness. NOVELLI facilitated participatory research with 67\u000a      industry stakeholders that identified the pitfalls of service standards\u000a      and the mitigating actions required to address them. Drawing upon the\u000a      recommendations from GambiaHost the Gambia Ministry of Tourism and\u000a      Culture funded a follow-up 12-day `Train the Trainers Programme' with 40\u000a      staff from hotels and tourism-related institutions on Customer Service\u000a      Skills and F&amp;B Cost Control. The beneficiaries of this training will\u000a      in turn train the rest of the employees on best practices on customer\u000a      excellence in their respective hotels (5.2, 5.9).\u000a    The Commonwealth Secretariat funded a project into customer service\u000a      capacity building in order to support the Namibia Tourism Board (NTB) in\u000a      implementing the 2011 `Tourism Human Resources Strategy for Namibia'.\u000a      NOVELLI and Taylor led three `train-the-trainers' pilot programmes with 60\u000a      Namibians working in tourism, who then became NTB-certified trainers in\u000a      January 2013 (5.5). Following the success of these programmes the NTB has\u000a      commissioned a further project into customer services and the delivery of\u000a      a Capacity Building Customer Service Training Programme that will train 25\u000a      tourism and shuttle operators and immigration officials in Swakopmund and\u000a      Windhoek.\u000a    NOVELLI and BURNS were further commissioned to produce two research\u000a      studies by the Aga Khan University (AKU) that produced recommendations on\u000a      ways to bridge the gap in postgraduate and executive education in Africa.\u000a      These led to AKU's strategic decision to invest in the establishment of a\u000a      new tourism-focused graduate and research school in East Africa (5.4).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Researchers at the University of Brighton have changed national tourism\u000a      policy and workforce training practices in African countries.

These are issues of continental importance, as Africa has been one\u000a      of the fastest-growing tourism regions in the world, but policy and\u000a      planning has been slow to respond to some of the human resource and\u000a      development challenges.\u000a    Origins: Tourism policy and planning research originates from\u000a      journal papers by BURNS [reference 3.1], NOVELLI [3.2] and BENSON [3.3]\u000a      based on findings from applied empirical work funded by the United Nations\u000a      World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) and the South East England Development\u000a      Agency (SEEDA). The findings demonstrated the inadequacy of traditional\u000a      approaches in tourism policy and strategic planning for human and physical\u000a      resource used both in developing and developed economies. BURNS' research\u000a      focused on post-conflict, fragile and emerging economies. This theme was\u000a      further researched in Africa by NOVELLI [3.4, 3.5] and by BENSON [3.3],\u000a      who demonstrated the opportunities and challenges for linking the rapidly\u000a      growing phenomenon of ecotourism and volunteer tourism to development.\u000a      Further empirical research by NOVELLI and BURNS [3.5] revealed the\u000a      importance of tourism network development and peer-to-peer capacity\u000a      building aimed at workforce development and poverty alleviation in Africa.\u000a    Critical intervention: The researchers devised new methodological\u000a      approaches that have also impacted upon tourism policy in Africa. A novel\u000a      participatory research method, the Rapid Situation Analysis (RSA), was\u000a      developed with funding from the ESRC (PTA-026-27-1451), and used to\u000a      produce new knowledge on innovative ways in which tourism can contribute\u000a      to local development [3.4]. Based on phenomenological principles, the RSA\u000a      approach included workshops, in-depth interviews, collaborative community\u000a      mapping and a range of public consultations aimed at investigating\u000a      stakeholder perceptions and practice in local tourism systems. RSA\u000a      demonstrated the importance of moving beyond largely Western conceived\u000a      ideas for establishing who benefits from existing tourism activities, in\u000a      order to give voice to those who experience tourism in some of the most\u000a      remote rural and poverty stricken areas of the world. In this way\u000a      indigenous voices can be embedded into both the micro- and the macro\u000a      policymaking processes.\u000a    Impact expansion: RSA has been used subsequently in research\u000a      funded by international organisations, including the World Bank, the\u000a      United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO),\u000a      the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and the\u000a      Commonwealth Secretariat. The research has led to knowledge transfer,\u000a      human capacity building and improvement of training and service standards\u000a      in Africa. The significance of the research findings and methodological\u000a      developments in the African context has been emphasised by the decision of\u000a      the Aga Khan University to work with University of Brighton researchers in\u000a      developing their executive tourism programme to be delivered at their new\u000a      campus in East Africa.\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Angela Benson:\u000a          Senior Lecturer (Jan 2004-Jul 2006), Principal\u000a            Lecturer (Aug 2006-to date)\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Peter Burns:\u000a          Professor of Tourism and Development (Sept 2000&#8211;Sept 2013)\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Christina Koutra:\u000a          Research Officer (Sept 2007&#8211;Aug 2008)\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Marina Novelli:\u000a          Senior Lecturer (Sept 2002&#8211;Jul 2006), Principal Lecturer (Aug\u000a            2006&#8211;Jan 2013), Reader (Feb 2013&#8211;to date)\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40281","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The key impacts of this research are the development of new professional\u000a      standards, guidelines and training in order to support The Football\u000a      Association's Safeguarding and Respect agendas; the introduction of a new\u000a      educational pathway for professional and aspirant referees; the delivery\u000a      of new forms of outreach in the local community and the development of new\u000a      funded programmes as part of the FA's National Game Strategy.\u000a    The research (2004, 2005) and associated contract work on the FA's Goal\u000a      Child Protection Strategy led to the development of resources for the FA's\u000a      Safeguarding Course, which has been accessed by an estimated 150,000\u000a      people in the period from 2008 to 2013.2 It also contributed to\u000a      the development of Safeguarding Policies and Codes of Conduct at the\u000a      55,000 youth football clubs in England. Continued collaboration with\u000a      Brackenridge at Brunel University led to further academic outputs and the\u000a      invitation to contract further significant research for the FA. The 2008\u000a      and 2009 evaluations of the Respect cultural change programme\u000a      stimulated adaptations to the Football Association's core interventions,\u000a      which focused on new codes of conduct; communications and relations\u000a      between team captains, players and match officials; and Respect `barriers'\u000a      or `technical areas'. In total, 850 football leagues across England are\u000a      now committed to Respect and all associated policies and\u000a      practices. Data from the Goal and Respect projects was\u000a      used in order to help shape The Football Association's Respect Parent\u000a      Module,3 an online educational resource that is now optional\u000a      for parents who follow their children through the sport, but compulsory\u000a      for all coaches. An estimated 30,000 coaches access the module each year\u000a      as part of their professional development. The Respect programme\u000a      now has a global reach. Both Holland and the USA have consulted with The\u000a      FA on the development of their own behaviour management initiatives; UEFA\u000a      have taken both the `brand' and significant elements into the\u000a      international arena and the Japanese FA have taken and copied the\u000a      programme wholesale.4\u000a    In the UK, the Respect recommendations were considered by the key\u000a      stakeholders in professional football including The FA Premier League, the\u000a      Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and the League Managers\u000a      Association (LMA). This led, in turn, to a report by the LMA in 2009\u000a      calling for the accreditation and professionalization of referee education\u000a      and training. Pitchford has subsequently worked with both The FA\u000a      and the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd (PGMOL) to develop a new\u000a      educational pathway for elite referees, which builds on both the Respect\u000a      data and the 2004 Training Needs Analysis. The new pathway was launched by\u000a      the PGMOL in 2012 and is delivered by the University of Gloucestershire.5\u000a    Pitchford's interest in the structures and format of the sport was\u000a      fuelled by research participants who consistently spoke about the\u000a      intrinsic, rather than the extrinsic, benefits of playing. They sought a\u000a      more playful, less pressurised version of the sport. In order to bring\u000a      this to reality, Pitchford made a successful bid to The Football\u000a      Foundation for &#163;160,000 to fund a five year football development programme\u000a      in deprived neighbourhoods in Gloucestershire. The project, called Onside,\u000a      used flexible, adapted versions of football to raise participation amongst\u000a      disengaged young people in challenging environments. Onside has\u000a      connected with over 6,000 young people during 2008 to 2013, and acts as a\u000a      source of data and experimentation for University staff and students\u000a      looking to explore this realm.\u000a    In 2009, Pitchford helped to support the establishment of a\u000a      pressure group, The National Children's Football Alliance (NCFA), which\u000a      aims to work with the sport's delivery organisations in order to improve\u000a      the experiences of children. The NCFA now has a reach of 200,000. 6\u000a      This work brought him into further contact with The Football Association\u000a      and he was then commissioned to produce the Drop Out in Youth Football\u000a      study. This work was widely utilised within The FA in order to stimulate\u000a      debate about the traditional structures and format of youth football and\u000a      was used to support the introduction of the national `Vauxhall Mash-Up'\u000a      programme, which aims to recruit and retain 14-18 year olds. The FA have\u000a      recruited eight regional coaches who work full time on the programme, and\u000a      have secured long term support from Vauxhall for the initiative.7\u000a    `Mash-up' is now a core element of the FA's 2011-2015 National Game\u000a      Strategy. The Strategy aims to make major changes to the experience of the\u000a      700,000 young people who currently participate in the sport, and to create\u000a      safer and more respectful environments for players, spectators and\u000a      volunteers. The research has contributed directly to this strategy through\u000a      the stimulation of practitioner debate over a sustained period, through\u000a      the introduction of new codes of conduct and professional standards, and\u000a      through the development of educational and training resources for players,\u000a      coaches, parents, spectators, officials and club administrators.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Andy Pitchford's research has been a significant influence on\u000a      the development of policies and services at The Football Association in\u000a      the period from 2008 to 2013.

Initially\u000a      the work centred on the interests of Professor Celia Brackenridge in child\u000a      protection and equality campaigns. Professor Brackenbridge left the\u000a      University in 2001, but continued to collaborate with Pitchford on\u000a      Goal (2001, 2002), an evaluation of The Football Association's\u000a      first child protection strategy.\u000a    The aim of the research team during this period was to use the voices of\u000a      children and young people in order to convince key stakeholders of the\u000a      need for more child-centred, ethical and inclusive approaches to the\u000a      delivery of youth sports. Data from this work were used as the basis for a\u000a      series of journal articles (2004a&amp;b, 2005c); and\u000a      then for a co-authored book, Brackenridge et al. (2007d).\u000a      The book enabled Pitchford to develop a new conceptual approach to\u000a      the analysis of young people playing the sport. This demonstrated the ways\u000a      in which the Football Association's policies and practices were\u000a      historically specific and contested, and not, as was previously assumed,\u000a      based on decades of learning and refinement. In turn, this helped to show\u000a      how youth football had become institutionalised, commercialised and\u000a      commodified; processes which had led to widespread dissatisfaction within,\u000a      and exclusion from, the sport.\u000a    From 2004 onwards, Pitchford had begun to work with other\u000a      football organisations on a research and consultancy basis. A Training\u000a        Needs Analysis for The Football Association's Refereeing Department\u000a      (2004), and a study of Professional Cultures in Elite Sport for UK\u000a      Sport and The Football Association (2005), helped to shape policy and\u000a      stimulate practitioner debate. This growing expertise around both referees\u000a      and young people led The Football Association in 2007 to return to\u000a      Brackenridge and Pitchford, who collaborated in order to conduct\u000a      an evaluation of Respect, a major cultural change programme aimed\u000a      at improving standards of behaviour at all levels of the sport. The 2008\u000a      and 2009 Respect evaluations helped to refine the Respect\u000a      interventions and to shape associated products and services, including an\u000a      online educational package for parents, The FA Respect Parent Module,\u000a      for which Pitchford was the specialist advisor. Data from these\u000a      reports then formed the basis for a journal article (2011e).\u000a    Findings from the early outputs informed Pitchford's keynote\u000a      presentation at the 2008 Youth Sport Conference at Loughborough\u000a      University, through which he argued for a new approach to youth football\u000a      that reflected the needs and demands of young people. In turn this led to\u000a      contributions to Radio 5 Live documentaries and local BBC Radio\u000a      Gloucestershire discussions. In December 2012 he was a major contributor\u000a      to BBC Radio 4's Football's Home Fans, a documentary assessing the\u000a      role of parents in the youth game.1 This continuing media\u000a      profile led to further contract work with The FA, including the 2011\u000a      project Drop Out in Youth Football; and with a new charity, the\u000a      National Children's Football Alliance (NCFA), for whom he conducted a\u000a      stakeholder survey in the same year.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40312","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has been instrumental in increasing children's outdoor play\u000d\u000a      on residential streets by:\u000d\u000a    1. Underpinning new interventions to increase children's active\u000d\u000a        outdoor play\u000d\u000a    In 2007, a range of dissemination activities took place (including\u000d\u000a      stakeholder events and media briefings) to showcase research quantifying\u000d\u000a      the contribution that time spent outdoors can make to children's physical\u000d\u000a      activity [1] and demonstrating that children spend the majority of their\u000d\u000a      time on built surfaces rather than in green spaces [2]. In 2008-9, people\u000d\u000a      who attended these events in Bristol used this evidence as a basis for\u000d\u000a      developing a new intervention to open up their streets for children's\u000d\u000a      play. The intervention involves simple signs and stewarding by local\u000d\u000a      residents to close selected residential streets to through-traffic after\u000d\u000a      school (from 3.30 to 5pm) so that children can play safely with minimal\u000d\u000a      disruption to cars. After this was successfully piloted, the residents set\u000d\u000a      up a new social enterprise Community Interest Company called `Playing Out\u000d\u000a      CIC' (www.playingout.net).

Increasing awareness and building partnerships\u000d\u000a    This pilot data was used by Playing Out CIC in partnership with Active\u000d\u000a      Bristol to encourage a cross-department collaboration within Bristol City\u000d\u000a      Council (BCC: Health, Children &amp; Young People's Services,\u000d\u000a      Sustainability and Transport) which led to a change in policy and in the\u000d\u000a      legal interpretation of transport regulations. This created a new\u000d\u000a      Temporary Street Play Order (TSPO) [a] which allowed regular street\u000d\u000a      closures on the basis of a single, annual application. Previously,\u000d\u000a      closures were restricted to two or three times per year. The wide support\u000d\u000a      for the `Playing Out' model from both the traditional and social media\u000d\u000a      brought the research to the attention of Play England who used the\u000d\u000a      research highlighting the importance of time outdoors to support the case\u000d\u000a      for outdoor play [b] and promote their national Love Outdoor Play\u000d\u000a      campaign.\u000d\u000a    3. Increasing funding potential and sustainability for third-sector\u000d\u000a        agencies\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research [1-4] was used in evidence briefings for\u000d\u000a      Bristol City Council [c] which led to increased and longer-term public\u000d\u000a      health funding for Playing Out CIC to deliver street play in 2010. The\u000d\u000a      evidence also helped enhance the funding potential of the play sector more\u000d\u000a      broadly by providing quantitative evidence which had been lacking. As Cath\u000d\u000a      Prisk, Director Play England asserts: \"There is very little\u000d\u000a        quantitative evidence to support the work of the play sector. This is\u000d\u000a        why we've joined up with ENHS as their research has showed that children\u000d\u000a        spent up to 30% of their time outside engaged in 'moderate to vigorous\u000d\u000a        physical activity'. If we could look to build up this kind of robust\u000d\u000a        evidence base it would give ourselves and community based organisations\u000d\u000a        access to further funding\" [d, 2012].\u000d\u000a    4. Influencing national policy\u000d\u000a    Page was invited to present a policy briefing on research findings\u000d\u000a      [1,2,4] to senior representatives of the Departments for Transport and\u000d\u000a      Health at two meetings in 2011 and 2012. In response to this, a\u000d\u000a      partnership involving the University of Bristol, Play England and Playing\u000d\u000a      Out CIC was invited to submit a bid to the Department for Health's\u000d\u000a      Innovation, Enterprise and Strategic Development fund. The bid was to roll\u000d\u000a      out the Playing Out model for street play nationally, alongside a national\u000d\u000a      campaign to promote street play and the provision of a web-based hub to\u000d\u000a      support residents in developing play opportunities in their communities.\u000d\u000a      The success of this bid [e], which is the largest single bid ever awarded\u000d\u000a      by the fund, confirms the acceptance of time spent outdoors as an\u000d\u000a      important public health target. The underpinning evidence [1,3,4] was also\u000d\u000a      used in the press release [f] to launch the national Free Range Kids\u000d\u000a      campaign initiated by Sustrans in 2011. This seeks to directly influence\u000d\u000a      policy and practice to encourage children to increase their independent\u000d\u000a      use of the environment. Examples of the impact of the Free Range Kids\u000d\u000a      campaign include political impact via the Early Day Motion 1954 (signed by\u000d\u000a      161 MPs) [g] and instrumental impact by, for example, the provision of\u000d\u000a      over 25,000 packs for parents to help them increase their children's\u000d\u000a      outdoor play. The importance of street play for children's physical\u000d\u000a      activity and health was recognised in the Annual Report of the Chief\u000d\u000a      Medical Officer 2012 [h]. This report includes the Bristol street play\u000d\u000a      model as a case study and cites ENHS research [5] to signal a shift in\u000d\u000a      national health policy highlighting street play as a significant source of\u000d\u000a      children's physical activity.\u000d\u000a    In summary, the impact from the underpinning research has significantly\u000d\u000a      benefited children by providing 304,200 new, regular outdoor play\u000d\u000a      opportunities. This translates to an additional ten minutes of MVPA per\u000d\u000a      day. To put this into context, a ten-minute per day change in weekday MVPA\u000d\u000a      increases the proportion of children meeting national health guidelines of\u000d\u000a      60 minutes per day of MVPA by 9% and children achieving guidelines are 35%\u000d\u000a      less likely to be in the top quartile for waist circumference. Beyond\u000d\u000a      increased physical activity for children, wider benefits include the\u000d\u000a      provision of 1,020 street-play champions within UK communities. They will\u000d\u000a      be supported by over 400 professionals from voluntary and public-sector\u000d\u000a      agencies who will receive new training in delivering street play [e]. The\u000d\u000a      reach of the impact continues to expand rapidly, with the underpinning\u000d\u000a      evidence increasingly highlighted to support policy and practice beyond\u000d\u000a      the UK. For example, Quebec has cited outputs [1] and [7] in making the\u000d\u000a      case for outdoor play being essential to youth health and development,\u000d\u000a      while the `Healthy Children-Healthy Spaces' collaboration has showcased\u000d\u000a      the Bristol Playing Out model in its campaign to get children active in\u000d\u000a      Canada [i].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Many children and young people are not sufficiently active to achieve a\u000d\u000a      range of physical and mental health benefits. Extensive research\u000d\u000a      undertaken at the University of Bristol has developed gold-standard\u000d\u000a      methods of quantifying the important contribution that time spent outdoors\u000d\u000a      and greater child independence make to children's daily physical activity.\u000d\u000a      This work has provided unique data to support the development of a new,\u000d\u000a      low-cost approach to adapting residential streets in Bristol for regular\u000d\u000a      outdoor play. The Bristol model has been adopted nationally to provide\u000d\u000a      street-play opportunities in the most disadvantaged areas. It is building\u000d\u000a      capacity to promote outdoor play in a range of public- and third-sector\u000d\u000a      agencies at local, regional and national levels. As a result, children are\u000d\u000a      spending more time outdoors and undertaking increased physical activity,\u000d\u000a      while both children and adults are engaging in more social interaction on\u000d\u000a      residential streets. The model has also been showcased internationally,\u000d\u000a      supporting a cultural shift towards reintroducing the street as a place\u000d\u000a      for children's outdoor play. This shift is necessary to combat the marked\u000d\u000a      decline in street play and child independence which has occurred in recent\u000d\u000a      decades.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Research outputs underpinning the case (papers in peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a          journals)\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Cooper, AR, Page, AS, Wheeler, BW, Hillsdon, M, Griew, PJ &amp; Jago,\u000d\u000a      R.

The need for\u000d\u000a      environmental interventions in halting the rise in obesity was central to\u000d\u000a      the influential 2007 UK Government Foresight Obesity report. Despite this\u000d\u000a      acknowledged need, methodological limitations restricted investigation\u000d\u000a      into children's use of the environment and hindered the development and\u000d\u000a      evaluation of environmental interventions. Research undertaken at the\u000d\u000a      University of Bristol has played a major part in addressing both of these\u000d\u000a      problems.\u000d\u000a    The Bristol research was conducted between 2006 and 2013. It has been led\u000d\u000a      by Dr A. Page (Lecturer (L)\/Senior Lecturer (SL) in Exercise and Health\u000d\u000a      Science 1994-2011, Reader in Physical Activity and Public Health 2011 to\u000d\u000a      present) and Professors A. Cooper (L\/SL\/Reader in Exercise and Health\u000d\u000a      Science 1997-2011, Professor of Physical Activity and Public Health 2011\u000d\u000a      to present) and R. Jago (L\/SL\/Reader in Exercise and Nutrition 2005-2012,\u000d\u000a      Professor of Paediatric Physical Activity and Public Health 2012 to\u000d\u000a      present) in the Centre for Exercise, Nutrition and Health Sciences (ENHS).\u000d\u000a      It has been funded by research grants totalling &#163;2.3 million from the\u000d\u000a      British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council, the World Cancer\u000d\u000a      Research Fund and the Department of Health. The research has produced a\u000d\u000a      body of internationally recognised work using objective data to quantify\u000d\u000a      the extent to which time outdoors relates to higher levels of children's\u000d\u000a      physical activity and that their independent mobility is a strong\u000d\u000a      predictor of increased time spent in active outdoor play. Specifically the\u000d\u000a      research has contributed in the following ways:\u000d\u000a    i. Developing new methods to quantify time spent outdoors and physical\u000d\u000a        activity\u000d\u000a    Page and Cooper identified that the development of lightweight personal\u000d\u000a      Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers would enable the outdoor\u000d\u000a      location of an individual to be objectively recorded (rather than\u000d\u000a      self-reported recall), and that if this information was integrated with\u000d\u000a      accelerometer data (an objective assessment of physical activity) it would\u000d\u000a      be possible to record the level and location of the person's daily\u000d\u000a      physical activity. Using these methods, Page and Cooper have, for the\u000d\u000a      first time, been able to accurately quantify differences in children's\u000d\u000a      level of activity outdoors and indoors. They have shown that physical\u000d\u000a      activity levels were two to three times higher outdoors than indoors [1].\u000d\u000a    ii. Emphasising the importance of streets for children's outdoor\u000d\u000a        physical activity\u000d\u000a    Further analysis of GPS and accelerometer data within a Geographic\u000d\u000a      Information System (GIS) allowed the time spent in different locations,\u000d\u000a      and the physical activity level within those locations, to be determined.\u000d\u000a      This demonstrated that while children are more active in green spaces such\u000d\u000a      as parks than in non-green spaces, only a small proportion of children's\u000d\u000a      time outdoors (less than 11%) is spent in green space. Time spent on built\u000d\u000a      surfaces and streets therefore contributes more to children's daily\u000d\u000a      physical activity and represents a very important, but previously\u000d\u000a      under-emphasised source of activity [2].\u000d\u000a    iii. Demonstrating the contribution of independent mobility and\u000d\u000a        parental license to children's outdoor physical activity\u000d\u000a    Alongside the use of GPS and accelerometer data, the Bristol team has\u000d\u000a      investigated the determinants of outdoor active play &#8212; a crucial step in\u000d\u000a      developing effective interventions. This work includes a new measure and\u000d\u000a      conceptualisation of children's independent mobility (IM: ability to visit\u000d\u000a      destinations in their neighbourhood unsupervised by adults) [3]. This new\u000d\u000a      measure has been shown to be a particularly important predictor of outdoor\u000d\u000a      play [4]. To augment data provided by the PEACH and PEAR projects [7,8],\u000d\u000a      Jago and Page used qualitative methods within the 3Ps and TAPP projects\u000d\u000a      [9,10] to explore children's freedom to roam, investigating the competing\u000d\u000a      pressures that parents face in balancing the benefits of active outdoor\u000d\u000a      play to their child's health against potential risks. They found that\u000d\u000a      children particularly value freedom from adult control and the\u000d\u000a      unstructured nature of active outdoor play and report concern about being\u000d\u000a      restricted by lack of suitable play spaces [5]. Parents also report that\u000d\u000a      taking part in activity with their children is difficult to achieve,\u000d\u000a      particularly during the school week [6].\u000d\u000a    iv. Underpinning development and evaluation of environmental\u000d\u000a        interventions to increase time spent active outdoors\u000d\u000a    The methods highlighted above have been extended to include adults and\u000d\u000a      support the development and funding of a series of flagship interventions.\u000d\u000a      Examples include: a) the MOVE project (ESRC funded; Cooper co-applicant),\u000d\u000a      where combined accelerometer and GPS data are being used by adolescents\u000d\u000a      within geography classes to stimulate greater engagement with the outdoor\u000d\u000a      environment and to increase time spent outdoors; b) Project ENABLE in\u000d\u000a      London (NPRI-funded; Cooper co-applicant), which investigates the unique\u000d\u000a      opportunity of whether movement of families into the Olympic Village will\u000d\u000a      increase use of the outdoor environment for physical activity; c) the\u000d\u000a      Bristol Biomedical Research Unit (NIHR-funded; Cooper lead for sedentary\u000d\u000a      theme), where GPS receivers combined with accelerometers are being used to\u000d\u000a      increase outdoor activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes; and d) The\u000d\u000a      Street Play project (Department of Health funded; Page academic lead),\u000d\u000a      which will roll out nationally a street-play intervention based on this\u000d\u000a      research, targeting areas in the top 10% for deprivation. This type of\u000d\u000a      funding is only awarded to schemes guaranteed to generate national impact.\u000d\u000a    In summary, since 2006 Page and Cooper have developed the world's largest\u000d\u000a      body of research using GPS and accelerometry to objectively quantify time\u000d\u000a      spent active outdoors and the importance of the built environment for\u000d\u000a      children's physical activity. These methods have been integrated with\u000d\u000a      survey and qualitative data (Jago and Page) to identify the major\u000d\u000a      contribution that both child independence and parental license make to\u000d\u000a      children's active outdoor play. The methods have been adopted by a range\u000d\u000a      of national and international research projects to implement and evaluate\u000d\u000a      new environmental interventions. These interventions promote increased\u000d\u000a      time spent active outdoors, which delivers significant health gains for\u000d\u000a      children.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40313","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This body of work has been pivotal in the implementation of local,\u000d\u000a      national and international active travel policies for children. These\u000d\u000a      policies have led to increases in active travel among children. As active\u000d\u000a      travel has been associated with improved health and is a sustainable form\u000d\u000a      of physical activity these policies will deliver both physical and mental\u000d\u000a      health benefits for beneficiaries in both the short and longer term. Three\u000d\u000a      broad pathways demonstrate the impact of the research:\u000d\u000a    A) UK Public Health Guidance\u000d\u000a    The research led to Cooper being invited to sit on the Programme\u000d\u000a      Development Group (PDG) for development of National Institute for Health\u000d\u000a      and Clinical Excellence (NICE; now National Institute for Health and Care\u000d\u000a      Excellence) Public Health Guidance for increasing children and young\u000d\u000a      people's physical activity. The guidance was published in January 2009\u000d\u000a      [a]. His invitation was a direct result of his leadership in research\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the potential for active travel to school to increase\u000d\u000a      children's overall physical activity. The guidance is intended for\u000d\u000a      implementation by a wide range of deliverers from national and high level\u000d\u000a      policy and strategy through to local strategic planning, local\u000d\u000a      organisations (planning, delivery and training) and local practitioners\u000d\u000a      (delivery) (guidance pg7). The recommendations are aimed at a wide range\u000d\u000a      of organisations and groups, including children's trusts and services,\u000d\u000a      community and voluntary groups, early years providers, Government\u000d\u000a      departments, local authorities, parents, families and carers and schools\u000d\u000a      and colleges (guidance pg 9) with the beneficiaries being pre-school and\u000d\u000a      school-age children and young people. Cooper contributed expert opinion on\u000d\u000a      academic research into active travel to school in the development of these\u000d\u000a      guidelines. The PDG produced 15 recommendations, of which two were\u000d\u000a      specifically about active travel (Rec5: Local Transport Plans: \"Transport\u000d\u000a        plans should aim to increase the number of children and young people who\u000d\u000a        regularly walk, cycle and use other modes of physically active travel\";\u000d\u000a      Rec12: Active and Sustainable School Travel Plans: that school leaders\u000d\u000a      should \"encourage a culture of physically active travel (such as\u000d\u000a        walking or cycling)\". The guidance is ubiquitous in regional and\u000d\u000a      national strategic plans to improve children's health (Section 4B);\u000d\u000a      however NICE do not collect evidence of impact.\u000d\u000a    B) International and National Policy impact\u000d\u000a    The research of Cooper and Page, and resulting NICE public health\u000d\u000a      guidance, has been cited in many regional, national and international\u000d\u000a      policy documents. For example, in County Durham the guidance is cited in\u000d\u000a      the interim cycling strategy 2009-2012 [b] which led to the FEAT 1st\u000d\u000a      (Families Enjoying Active Travel) pilot project. This measured the effects\u000d\u000a      of encouraging more physically active travel by supporting daily journeys\u000d\u000a      to school on foot and by bike and was a collaboration between North\u000d\u000a      Tyneside Council and the transport charity Sustrans (with whom Cooper\u000d\u000a      &amp; Page work (Section 4C)). The project resulted in an increase in\u000d\u000a      active travel to school and an almost doubling of children's physical\u000d\u000a      activity [c], and is now being rolled out across schools in Tyne and Wear.\u000d\u000a      Nationally, they are cited in the policy documents of organisations\u000d\u000a      promoting active travel (e.g. the Cycle Touring Club (\"Cycle-friendly\u000d\u000a        schools and colleges\" briefing 7c (July 2012)) and Sustrans [d], and\u000d\u000a      more broadly health (British Medical Association; \"Healthy\u000d\u000a        Transport=Healthy Lives\" (July 2012)). Internationally, they\u000d\u000a      are cited in policy documents from several countries including Australia,\u000d\u000a      USA, New Zealand, Denmark and Ireland. For example, In the USA four of\u000d\u000a      their studies are cited in \"Active School Travel: A Resource Binder for\u000d\u000a        Redwood City Community Members to Implement Walk and Bike to School\u000d\u000a        Programs\" [e]. This document describes how to implement active\u000d\u000a      travel to school interventions and provides many examples of success, such\u000d\u000a      as in Marin County where there has been a 64% increase in the number of\u000d\u000a      students walking to school and a 114% increase in the number of children\u000d\u000a      bicycling to school (page 29). They also provide three of twenty\u000d\u000a      references in a policy document from the US National Center for Safe\u000d\u000a      Routes to School [f] which informed the White House \"Task Force on\u000d\u000a        Childhood Obesity: Report to the President\" [g] where their work is\u000d\u000a      cited twice (of four references) supporting the role of active travel for\u000d\u000a      obesity prevention. This action plan provides 70 specific recommendations\u000d\u000a      of which five relate to active travel (5.8 to 5.12) including that \"Active\u000d\u000a        transport should be encouraged between homes, schools, and community\u000d\u000a        destinations.......\". These recommendations were enacted rapidly by\u000d\u000a      US Federal agencies, with the Department for Transportation initiating\u000d\u000a      National Bike to School day in 2012, which in 2013 had 1705 schools\u000d\u000a      participate across all states of the USA.\u000d\u000a    C) Working with national and international health promotion groups to\u000d\u000a        deliver direct benefits to beneficiaries\u000d\u000a    Cooper &amp; Page work directly with national and international\u000d\u000a      organisations to achieve increases in active travel among children. In\u000d\u000a        the UK they work closely with Sustrans in supporting active travel\u000d\u000a      to school programmes such as Safe Routes to Schools and Bike It by\u000d\u000a      providing both the evidence base from their research and expert guidance\u000d\u000a      that they provide directly to the organisation. The Sustrans programmes\u000d\u000a      are highly effective at increasing active travel. For example, in 2011,\u000d\u000a      work with 340,000 pupils in 1,400 schools resulted in an 80% increase in\u000d\u000a      the number of children regularly cycling to school. Philip Insall\u000d\u000a      (Sustrans Director, Health) has written \"their research provides\u000d\u000a        important support for us and helps steer and ensure the success of our\u000d\u000a        work\" [h]. In Denmark their work is represented on the\u000d\u000a      National Board of Health by Prof. Andersen and integrated into\u000d\u000a      recommendations (\"Physical activity in prevention and treatment of\u000d\u000a        common diseases\"), targeted for GPs and other health professionals.\u000d\u000a      Their research informs the work of TrygFonden, a not-for-profit Foundation\u000d\u000a      supporting action-orientated, knowledge-based projects that contribute to\u000d\u000a      increased safety, and where active transport in children is a primary\u000d\u000a      focus. For example, in 2010 The All Kids Bikes campaign engaged 143,000\u000d\u000a      children across Denmark in cycling to school on as many days as possible,\u000d\u000a      and a recent intervention in almost 2000 children in 24 schools in Odense\u000d\u000a      increased the proportion of children cycling to school every day by 8.9%\u000d\u000a      (report in review by Danish Cycling Federation\/TrygFonden).\u000d\u000a    In summary, their work provides the evidence base to support an extensive\u000d\u000a      range of interventions to increase active travel to school, is cited\u000d\u000a      widely in policy and planning documents, and is used by agencies\u000d\u000a      implementing these policies. It should be noted that the policy documents\u000d\u000a      for these interventions are not extensive reviews of the literature &#8212;\u000d\u000a      rather they include a few examples of authoritative research which has\u000d\u000a      driven the field. The implementation of school active travel interventions\u000d\u000a      will increase the physical activity of children with consequent health\u000d\u000a      benefits and are also likely to have environmental and economic benefit to\u000d\u000a      society, through reducing car use and lowering carbon emissions.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In May 2012 the UK Chief Medical Officer (CMO) convened a specialist\u000d\u000a      group of 20 academics to discuss a solution to the \"population-level lack\u000d\u000a      of physical activity\". The group, including Professor Ashley Cooper,\u000d\u000a      concluded that increasing active travel (walking or cycling) to\u000d\u000a      destinations such as work or school is the best option for achieving this\u000d\u000a      aim and encouraged the CMO to embed this is future policy initiatives.\u000d\u000a      Children are a major focus of such initiatives, since the majority of UK\u000d\u000a      children are not sufficiently active to meet current health guidelines,\u000d\u000a      and over the past decade active travel to school has been recognised as a\u000d\u000a      major opportunity for children to achieve healthy levels of physical\u000d\u000a      activity. This case study describes a programme of funded [6,7] research\u000d\u000a      work which has directly informed and underpinned understanding of the\u000d\u000a      importance of active travel to school by policy makers and public health\u000d\u000a      practitioners. The research is heavily cited in policy and planning\u000d\u000a      documents from 2009 to the present date, both in the UK and\u000d\u000a      internationally, and is used by organisations which implement\u000d\u000a      interventions to increase active travel in the UK and internationally. Via\u000d\u000a      these routes this work has benefitted children in many countries through\u000d\u000a      increased physical activity, higher fitness and improved health.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2615876","Name":"Odense"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Publications in peer reviewed journals\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Cooper AR, Page AS, Foster LJ, Qahwaji D.

Children who walked to school were significantly more\u000d\u000a      physically active than those travelling by car, and time-patterning showed\u000d\u000a      that the differences occurred during morning and afternoon commuting\u000d\u000a      times, suggesting that it is the journey to\/from school that is important.\u000d\u000a      This paper was the first to use this methodology and is highly cited.\u000d\u000a    To confirm these observations and to extend the work to include cycling,\u000d\u000a      Cooper &amp; Page used their involvement as originators in the European\u000d\u000a      Youth Heart Study (EYHS) to explore the physical activity levels of\u000d\u000a      children travelling to school by foot, car and bicycle in Odense, Denmark,\u000d\u000a      working with Prof L.B.Andersen (an acknowledged world leader in the field)\u000d\u000a      in the University of Southern Denmark. Similar to the UK, they found that\u000d\u000a      children who walked to school were more active than car travellers, with\u000d\u000a      cyclists at an intermediate level due to the limited ability of\u000d\u000a      accelerometers to accurately measure physical activity whilst cycling [2].\u000d\u000a      These data have also been highly cited. Cycling is the most common form of\u000d\u000a      travel to school in Denmark, and to further explore its contribution to\u000d\u000a      health they compared the fitness levels of children by how they travelled\u000d\u000a      to school, finding that cyclists were significantly fitter (8%) than both\u000d\u000a      walkers and car travellers. These were the first data to describe the\u000d\u000a      physical fitness of children by mode of travel to school and to identify\u000d\u000a      higher fitness in cyclists [3]. To confirm that the association with\u000d\u000a      fitness was not self-selection (i.e. fitter children choose to cycle) they\u000d\u000a      utilised the longitudinal nature of the EYHS data showing that children\u000d\u000a      who did not cycle to school when 9yrs old, but had changed to cycling by\u000d\u000a      15yrs old, increased fitness, whilst those who did not cycle were\u000d\u000a      unchanged [4]. This international work has continued, showing that\u000d\u000a      children who cycle to school have a better cardiovascular risk factor\u000d\u000a      profile than non-cyclists. Importantly, those who changed from non-cycling\u000d\u000a      at 9yrs to cycling by age 15yrs are also healthier, demonstrating the\u000d\u000a      importance of cycling to school for children's health.\u000d\u000a    Cooper and Page extended this work within the UK in the PEACH project [7]\u000d\u000a      by employing innovative methodology. Combining accelerometer and GPS data\u000d\u000a      they visualised journeys to and from school in a Geographical Information\u000d\u000a      System, allowing activity in these journeys to be accurately quantified, a\u000d\u000a      method called spatial segmentation. They have published unique papers\u000d\u000a      using this method to describe the contribution of walking to school to\u000d\u000a      overall moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and hence to meeting\u000d\u000a      health guidelines for children [5]. They have extended this method to\u000d\u000a      study adults [8], showing that walking to work is an important contributor\u000d\u000a      to adult physical activity.\u000d\u000a    In summary, Cooper and Page have conducted an ongoing programme of work\u000d\u000a      over the past 12 years, supported by five inter-related grants from highly\u000d\u000a      competitive funding agencies (MRC (National Prevention Research\u000d\u000a      Initiative), World Cancer Research Fund, NIHR) which has provided original\u000d\u000a      and unique data describing the role of active commuting in children's\u000d\u000a      physical activity and health. They were the first to use objective\u000d\u000a      measures of physical activity to show the importance of active travel to\u000d\u000a      overall physical activity, a study that has been replicated many times in\u000d\u000a      different countries and contexts. Their papers are highly cited, were\u000d\u000a      included in the Centres submission to RAE 2008 [1-3] where the Centre was\u000d\u000a      ranked third (UoA 46), and have been widely incorporated into policy\u000d\u000a      documents and guidance.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40391","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    (Note: Bracketed numbers and letters refer to Section 3 and 5,\u000a      respectively)\u000a    Exeter's research on exercise and smoking cessation has had impact in\u000a      three important ways: (1)\u000a      informing global health care policy guidelines, (2) generating global\u000a      media interest and informing\u000a      public debate and (3) providing clinical support for patients and\u000a      practitioners on best practice.\u000a    (1) Informing global health care policy guidelines\u000a    Our Cochrane Review [1] has been cited by organisations around the world\u000a      in guidelines on the\u000a      use of formal exercise interventions to support smoking cessation (e.g.,\u000a      by Royal Australian\u000a      College of General Practitioners Australia [A], and by the National Centre\u000a      for Smoking Cessation\u000a      and Training in the UK [B]).

An evidence\u000a      base is required to support policy, practitioners and the public on if\u000a      exercise is useful for these\u000a      conditions and what support is effective to help patients increase and\u000a      maintain physical activity.\u000a      Research carried out by Taylor (joined Exeter University, September, 2003)\u000a      spans phases from\u000a      pre-clinical and theory building to evaluation within randomised\u000a      controlled trials (RCTs), and\u000a      evidence synthesis. The research has significantly contributed to what we\u000a      know about the effects\u000a      of acute and chronic exercise interventions for patients with depression\u000a      and smokers, and how to\u000a      increase and maintain physical activity.\u000a    Most exercise interventions targeted at smokers wishing to quit smoking\u000a      have involved\u000a      supervised sessions lasting 40+ min, on 2-3 days per week, to increase\u000a      aerobic fitness. Only one\u000a      study, as revealed in our 2008 review [1], showed effects on increasing\u000a      long-term abstinence. In\u000a      2007 the first systematic review of the literature [2], including 3 of our\u000a      own original studies, showed\u000a      that a short single bout of brisk walking, compared with passive controls,\u000a      reduced cravings and\u000a      smoking-cue reactivity. In response to global media interest, and\u000a      questions about the mechanisms,\u000a      our subsequent acute studies have shown that physical activity reduces\u000a      attentional bias to and\u000a      salience of smoking images, using video and still images and functional\u000a      magnetic resonance\u000a      imagery of the brain. We integrated the promotion of short bouts of\u000a      physical activity to manage\u000a      cravings into a standard smoking cessation programme [3] through 2 years\u000a      of collaborative action\u000a      research involving both NHS Stop Smoking Service advisors and\u000a      approximately 140 smokers (in\u000a      Plymouth &amp; Birmingham), to develop a way to integrate physical\u000a      activity support into routine care,\u000a      using our self-help `Walk-2-Quit' guide.

Over 3 times as\u000a      many quit in our\u000a      intervention v. control group. Our intervention cost &#163;192 per participant,\u000a      and exploratory cost-effectiveness\u000a      modelling indicated this would provide huge financial savings for health\u000a      services.\u000a    Our NIHR-HTA funded systematic review of RCTs revealed that exercise\u000a      referral schemes\u000a      (ERS) have only a small, if any, benefit for increasing long-term physical\u000a      activity and reducing\u000a      depression [4], contrary to NICE clinical guideline CG90. In 2005, Taylor\u000a      and colleagues at Bristol\u000a      (Haase, Fox &amp; Lewis) developed an 8 month counselling intervention to\u000a      facilitate increases in\u000a      physical activity for depressed patients, to be rolled out into the NHS if\u000a      effective and acceptable to\u000a      patients. It drew on principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive\u000a      behavioural therapy to\u000a      enhance Self-Determination Theory constructs of competence, autonomy and\u000a      relatedness [5].\u000a      Within a NIHR-HTA funded RCT we showed that the intervention (offered to\u000a      161 depressed\u000a      patients) increased physical activity, but did not reduce depression,\u000a      compared with usual care [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40540","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Following the completion of the research in 2011, the results have been\u000a      used by Miller Research Ltd. to inform their work on the Food Tourism\u000a      Strategy for the Causeway Coast and Glens region of North Ulster in\u000a      Northern Ireland and the Brecon Beacons National Park Food Strategy in\u000a      Wales with an aim of networking producers to create a shared vision for\u000a      food tourism and increase visitor spend on food produce [5.1]. The Irish\u000a      Tourist Board (F&#225;ilte Ireland) has also used the research results to\u000a      involve local champions in food tourism and to make food tourism in\u000a      Ireland more sustainable [5.2].\u000a    The results of the research have also been taken forward by Miller\u000a      Research to inform policy initiatives in partnership with local and\u000a      regional authorities. These include the organisation of conferences with\u000a      national, regional and local stakeholders in association with the\u000a      Abergavenny Food Festival to promote the relationship between food\u000a      tourism, community development and regeneration; working with Visit County\u000a      Durham to upgrade the status of the Bishop Auckland Food Festival to a\u000a      premier regional event as part of the region's wider tourism strategy; and\u000a      strategy work on the Thames Food Festival to improve visitor perceptions\u000a      of South Oxfordshire and to increase levels of tourist expenditure on\u000a      local food produce. The research results are also informing the creation\u000a      of a food network and festival for Newport aiming to attract food tourists\u000a      to the city [5.2].\u000a    Attributable to the research has been the development of networks and\u000a      organised events to bring stakeholders together to enhance cross-sectoral\u000a      understanding in an attempt to overcome barriers identified to food\u000a      tourism development. The Institute for Tourism Research (INTOUR) at the\u000a      University of Bedfordshire hosted an event on Food Related Tourism\u000a      in September 2010 [5.3] at which over 60 delegates from local businesses\u000a      attended and local producers were invited to sell products in a small\u000a      marketplace at the event. The spatial reach of the impact upon commerce\u000a      has extended beyond the United Kingdom to Norway. Following a key note\u000a      address by Dr. Everett on the research at an industry seminar in 2011 at\u000a      North Cape industries in Norway, the Rico chain of hotels expressed\u000a      interest in increasing the use of local produce to both sustain local\u000a      producers and offer more local produce to their visitors [5.4].\u000a    Public seminars were organised by the research team to disseminate the\u000a      research and provide a forum in which local producers could network and\u000a      seek advice on how to develop food tourism. For example, co-hosted with\u000a      Miller Research `The Big Food Debate' on 18 September 2009 brought\u000a      together approximately 70 delegates aiming to develop food tourism. A\u000a      further public food tourism seminar was organised in conjunction with the\u000a      Scottish Border Food Network (SBFN) in Melrose from the 29 - 30 November\u000a      2009 as part of a wider set of projects to raise understanding of food\u000a      tourism at which the results of the research were presented [5.5]. The\u000a      event brought together an audience of 60 delegates including travel\u000a      journalists, food writers, tour operators, academics, the head of the\u000a      Scottish government food industry unit, representatives from NFU Scotland,\u000a      Scotland Food and Drink, Scottish Enterprise, Scottish Borders Council,\u000a      VisitScotland and MSPs. This event galvanised support for the SBFN who\u000a      have now developed a five-year Regional food strategy to enable Scottish\u000a      Borders to compete effectively in the national food and drink sector\u000a      [5.6]. Alongside contributing to the establishment of the Borders network,\u000a      beneficiaries were local producers looking to access local markets and\u000a      consumers now able to locate local produce.\u000a    With an aim of facilitating communication between stakeholders of food\u000a      tourism development and providing information for consumers an online\u000a      resource of the `UK Food Tourism' website was developed [5.7].

Food\u000a      tourism may be understood as the development of regionally specific food\u000a      and service based products that aim to increase visitor numbers within the\u000a      framework of sustainability [3.1]. Key elements include: a focus on the\u000a      use and promotion of localised agricultural produce; the strengthening of\u000a      local agricultural supply chains to the tourism industry; maximising the\u000a      economic benefits of tourist spend through enhanced multiplier effects and\u000a      reduced leakage; contributing to environmental sustainability by reducing\u000a      food miles and encouraging sustainable agriculture; and aiding community\u000a      stability through employment creation.\u000a    The Principal Investigator was Dr. Sally Everett who was employed as a\u000a      Senior Lecturer and later Head of Department by the University from May 1\u000a      2008 to December 31 2012 and the co-investigator was Dr. Susan Slocum\u000a      employed as a Research Assistant from March 1 2010 to March 31 2011.\u000a      Knowledge exchange activities were undertaken in partnership with a\u000a      private consultancy, Miller Research Ltd (www.miller-research.co.uk)\u000a      who had experience of consultancy on food tourism. The first phase of the\u000a      research involved consultations with food tourism specialists, providers\u000a      and associations on the potential of food tourism for sustainable\u000a      development. They included: Steve Blaimire, Consultant for Food\u000a      Development and Marketing, Isle of Wight; The Anglesey Sea Salt Company;\u000a      Peelham Farms\/Scottish Borders Network; Slow Food Berwick-Upon-Tweed; Phil\u000a      Jones, Food Festival Manager for Manchester Food and Drink. The focus of\u000a      these consultations was upon the potential of food tourism as a tourism\u000a      product and generator of economic, social and environmental benefits.\u000a      Simultaneously an analysis of relevant policy documents to assess the\u000a      potential for food tourism in rural sustainable development was consulted.\u000a      They included: DEFRA (2002) `Our Countryside: The Future - A Fair Deal for\u000a      Rural England'; DEFRA (2005) `Securing the future delivering UK\u000a      sustainable development strategy'; DEFRA (2010) `Food 2030'; Cabinet\u000a      Office (2002) `Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food'; and\u000a      the Welsh Assembly (2009) `Food Tourism Action Plan: Food and Drink for\u000a      Wales'. A required need for systematic research to inform the creation of\u000a      `vehicles of practical help' for food tourism suppliers and organisers was\u000a      identified to facilitate the interface for producer and consumer\u000a      engagements.\u000a    The second stage of the research consisted of a questionnaire survey of\u000a      267 attendees at three regional food festivals at Abergavenny, Stratford,\u000a      and East Midlands about their attitudes to food tourism. This data was\u000a      analysed and discussed as a component of the third research phase of 16\u000a      stakeholder interviews conducted during March and April 2010 with food\u000a      and\/or tourism organisations to establish a list of industry needs to\u000a      participate in food tourism. The results of the research indicate that\u000a      significant barriers to participation in food tourism development exist\u000a      for both food tourism providers and consumers. For the suppliers of food\u000a      tourism these include: identifying and accessing tourism markets, as\u000a      available data is limited, fragmented and not updated; the need to\u000a      establish a destination brand that is reflective of local food production;\u000a      not being able to access any available data on best-practice food tourism\u000a      case studies from other regions of the United Kingdom; consumers and the\u000a      hospitality industry lack knowledge of the geography and access to local\u000a      produce, nor do they comprehend the range of benefits of purchasing\u000a      locally; a lack of networks and partnerships between both food producers\u000a      and hostelries, and between potential partner regions.\u000a    For food tourism festival and event organisers the identified challenges\u000a      included: a struggle to make food festivals and farmers' markets\u000a      financially self-sustainable; an absence of a national promotional agency\u000a      for food festivals and farmers' markets; and a lack of information on\u000a      local food sourcing, advertisers and funding schemes [3.2, 3.3]. There was\u000a      also found to be regional variations in the coherence between local\u000a      government initiatives, regional food organizations and tourism bodies. In\u000a      some districts these stakeholders work together in partnerships whilst in\u000a      other areas they are highly competitive. The majority of tour operators\u000a      have difficulty connecting local agriculture with tourist activities, for\u000a      example the visiting of farms and educating the tourists on traditional\u000a      production techniques [3.4].

Key\u000a      challenges relate to: the organisation and networking of stakeholders\u000a      involved in the supply of food tourism; and raising levels of consumer\u000a      awareness about food tourism to link them to suppliers.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40545","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has been impactful at a number of levels. Firstly, national\u000a      governing bodies such as\u000a      the England and Wales Cricket Board have written into their coach\u000a      education awards the use of\u000a      CAIS in order for coaches to be able to explore their coaching practice. A\u000a      pilot licence of the tool\u000a      was provided to the England batting Coach, when he was in India with the\u000a      full England Cricket\u000a      Team (October-December 2012). We have piloted and used the tool with\u000a      England Hockey coaches\u000a      at workshops [3.4, 5.4] and High Performance Coaching events such as their\u000a      2012 High\u000a      Performance Assessment Camps and Futures Cup, which are the contexts for\u000a      junior high\u000a      performance development [5.5]. At these events we have had coaches utilise\u000a      the CAIS iPad\u000a      software tool to enable them to analyse their own and other coaches'\u000a      practice [5.5].\u000a    A company, Axis Coaching [5.1, 5.2], has been formed, of which Harvey has\u000a      a part-ownership\u000a      (17.5%), which is taking the developments of the iPad app [5.3] to the\u000a      sports coaching community.\u000a      The development of CAIS as an iPad application has involved working with\u000a      an Irish-based\u000a      performance analysis company, and these developments are on-going.\u000a    The official launch event of CAIS was held with collaborators\u000a      Loughborough University in\u000a      November 2012 where key players in the sport and education sectors were\u000a      present. Examples\u000a      include the British Olympic Association (now Performance Director as the\u000a      Football Association)\u000a      and representatives from performance sport in higher education\u000a      institutions (University of Stirling).\u000a    CAIS has been sold to the following organisations: Sports Coach UK for\u000a      use with their ASPIRE\u000a      program; Leicester City Football Club and the England and Wales Cricket\u000a      Board.

He also visited\u000a      staff at West Virginia\u000a      University and they have also expressed interest in the product. The\u000a      development team including\u000a      Harvey have also discussed offering different versions of CAIS for\u000a      different markets. For example,\u000a      Harvey and collaborators are considering developing a `lite' version of\u000a      the application restricted to\u000a      a few of the behaviours on the main product making the application more\u000a      available to individual\u000a      coaches in addition to large organisations. We have approached individuals\u000a      such as sport\u000a      performance directors in HEI's and they have fed back favourably on this\u000a      and suggested they\u000a      would be able to purchase licences on this basis. CAIS was nominated for a\u000a      Research Enterprise\u000a      Award at Loughborough University and received an Honourable Mention at the\u000a      final awards\u000a      ceremony.\u000a    The England Hockey coaches [5.6] that were engaged in the project are\u000a      Centrally Contracted\u000a      Coaches and this role involves them working with and assessing other\u000a      coaches. These coaches\u000a      stated the value of the tool in helping them in this role.

Allied to this,\u000a      systematic observation has been a key data collection tool for researchers\u000a      in order to analyse\u000a      teaching and coaching behaviour for the last 30 years. Developments of\u000a      computer technology have\u000a      `breathed new life' into this methodology as it enables the simultaneous\u000a      capture of multiple\u000a      coaching intervention behaviours, thus giving a more nuanced and complete\u000a      account of the\u000a      coaching process. The Coach Analysis Intervention System (CAIS) iPad\u000a      application allows for both\u000a      `live' coding and post-session coding, and thus is a useful tool for\u000a      practitioners and researchers\u000a      alike. CAIS is not only one of the first specific coaching behaviour tools\u000a      to be integrated with\u000a      computerised technology to aid coach behaviour techniques and practices,\u000a      but also it is the first\u000a      iPad software application that has been produced for this purpose. What is\u000a      also unique about this\u000a      iPad application is that, unlike many other iPad apps that could be used\u000a      to analyse coaching\u000a      behaviour and practice, it is fully underpinned by research and\u000a      development. Indeed, the\u000a      application only allows bespoke additions of behaviours that are validated\u000a      in the CAIS study by\u000a      Harvey and colleagues published in the Journal of Sport Sciences (JSS)\u000a      in 2012 [3.1].\u000a    The validation, development and initial research analysis with the tool\u000a      has been carried out from\u000a      January 2008 to the present time. While initial development work was\u000a      carried out when Harvey\u000a      was employed at a previous organisation (in collaboration with Muir and\u000a      Cushion; which involved in\u000a      stages 2 and 3 of CAIS highlighted in the JSS paper, 2012; [3.1]),\u000a      the work conducted on CAIS\u000a      since Harvey's arrival at the University of Bedfordshire (UoB) (Sept 2010)\u000a      which included some\u000a      additional coding of coaching behaviours as well as the intra- and\u000a      inter-observer reliability testing\u000a      highlighted in stages 4 and 5 of CAIS (see the JSS paper, 2012;\u000a      [3.1]), the production of the paper\u000a      in the Sports Coaching Review [3.3] and the initial piloting of CAIS on\u000a      the iPad platform with\u000a      England Hockey coaches (April 2012; [5.4]), research that was funded by an\u000a      internal research\u000a      grant from UoB. This work was presented in September 2013 to the\u000a      International Council for\u000a      Coach Education (ICCE) conference [3.5].\u000a    The publication of the JSS validation paper [3.1] has therefore\u000a      permitted the production of other\u000a      related research outputs and presentations [3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6]. It\u000a      has also formed the basis of\u000a      UoB-funded grant to work with coaches from England Hockey, the National\u000a      Governing Body for\u000a      hockey in England [5.4]. These links exist as Harvey works for England\u000a      Hockey as a Centrally\u000a      Contracted Coach and Coach Educator. He is also an assistant coach to the\u000a      England U16 National\u000a      Age Group Team. These links give him access to key decision-makers\u000a      permitting Harvey to\u000a      conduct research within England Hockey's Single System.\u000a    Furthermore, two PhD students (Cope and Pears) are using CAIS in contexts\u000a      outside of England\u000a      Hockey. Cope is using CAIS to explore youth soccer and youth swim coaches'\u000a      use of coaching\u000a      behaviours [5.7], and Pears is using CAIS in a study examining girls'\u000a      Centre of Excellence\u000a      Academy coaches' behaviours and practices [5.8].\u000a    Harvey is also continuing to collaborate in the development of CAIS with\u000a      Dr. Christopher Cushion\u000a      of Loughborough University and PhD student Mark Partington with research\u000a      conducted with youth\u000a      soccer academy coaches.

Central to the development of this\u000d\u000a      information service was Surrey's analysis of the market and existing\u000d\u000a      access schemes. The information service is the first European-wide scheme,\u000d\u000a      which represents a major advance in the provision of information on\u000d\u000a      accessible facilities (Letter of support `TourismForAll').\u000d\u000a    Apart from better fulfilling informational needs, our research has called\u000d\u000a      for support at all stages in the delivery of social tourism in order to\u000d\u000a      realise effective social outcomes. In 2010, Tourism Flanders (Regional\u000d\u000a      Tourist Board for Northern Belgium) organised several workshops to\u000d\u000a      introduce our research findings to social tourism partners. Subsequently\u000d\u000a      these recommendations were implemented by the Tourism Flanders' Holiday\u000d\u000a      Participation Centre. Following these recommendations, in 2011 Tourism\u000d\u000a      Flanders funded (&#8364;375,000) the development of a network of regional\u000d\u000a      `travel shops' in social support organisations. These travel shops\u000d\u000a      comprise teams of support workers who specialise in helping socially\u000d\u000a      excluded groups to overcome barriers to tourism participation.

In addition, the FETE scheme, funded under the EU's\u000d\u000a      Calypso programme, for which Surrey was a research partner, produced a\u000d\u000a      pilot exchange scheme between Belgium, Germany, Sweden and Finland. 14\u000d\u000a      young people without prior international travel experience were given the\u000d\u000a      opportunity to visit a non-neighbouring partner country in the low season.\u000d\u000a      The project produced direct social and economic impacts on the\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries and touristic partners involved. Tourism businesses were\u000d\u000a      further supported through the establishment of accessibility tourism\u000d\u000a      networks. The `Europeforall' website, based on Surrey's research, enabled\u000d\u000a      individual destinations, such as `VisitOslo', to improve the provision of\u000d\u000a      accessibility information by adopting the OSSATE scheme.

This research, based on semi-longitudinal interviews\u000d\u000a      and focus groups with social tourism users and support workers,\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the benefits of social tourism in terms of confidence, social\u000d\u000a      networks, family relations, mental health and positive behaviour changes.\u000d\u000a      It showed that social tourism can reduce direct, indirect and opportunity\u000d\u000a      social welfare costs, and highlighted the need for appropriate support\u000d\u000a      before, during and after the holiday as keys to realising social benefits\u000d\u000a      (Minnaert, Maitland and Miller, 2009).\u000d\u000a    From 2010, Miller and Minnaert (both Surrey) brought together academics,\u000d\u000a      policy makers and the commercial tourism sector to analyse the potential\u000d\u000a      of social tourism for the UK. NET-STaR (Network for Social Tourism and\u000d\u000a      Regeneration) used the theoretical work of academics, including Miller and\u000d\u000a      Minnaert, to identify and evaluate transferable, good practice examples\u000d\u000a      from across Europe, including innovations in social enterprise,\u000d\u000a      public-private partnerships and voluntary sector provision in the social\u000d\u000a      economy. Building on this research, Surrey became the leading research\u000d\u000a      partner in FETE (First European Travel Experience), funded under the EU's\u000d\u000a      Calypso programme. FETE implements a substantial pilot exchange of\u000d\u000a      disadvantaged young people without international travel experience,\u000d\u000a      between Belgium, Germany, Finland and Sweden. Surrey's research was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in shaping this international co-operation.\u000d\u000a    2.2 In 2005-2007, Surrey's research focused on how to widen\u000d\u000a      tourism participation. Previously, little was known about the travel\u000d\u000a      behaviour of individuals with access needs and the market size for\u000d\u000a      accessible tourism in Europe, with estimates varying considerably. Yet,\u000d\u000a      our study provided the first conclusive evidence). The significance of\u000d\u000a      this work is emphasised by their finding that the demand for accessible\u000d\u000a      tourism in Europe exceeds 127 million (27% of the European population)\u000d\u000a      (Eichhorn, Miller, Michopoulou, Buhalis (2008).\u000d\u000a    Researchers at Surrey also analysed information access schemes across 19\u000d\u000a      countries. With results showing that existing schemes only partly comply\u000d\u000a      with informational requirements due to high fragmentation and limited\u000d\u000a      geographical reach. These findings led to the development of the first\u000d\u000a      European-wide accessibility scheme (www.europeforall.com).\u000a      Surrey's research informed the scheme, and underpinned the business plan.\u000d\u000a    2.3 From 2009 to 2011, we investigated the supply-side barriers to\u000d\u000a    accessibility, significantly under-researched compared to demand. Surrey\u000d\u000a    analysed how tourism SMEs could be more sustainable and competitive. The\u000d\u000a    findings, derived from focus groups with SMEs and expert interviews,\u000d\u000a    demonstrated that the principal barriers to accessible tourism were\u000d\u000a    structural, informational and attitudinal. It was demonstrated that the most\u000d\u000a    effective knowledge-based networks to overcome these barriers should enable\u000d\u000a    informal interactions within formal structures, where close physical\u000d\u000a    proximity facilitate trust-based relationships &#8212; (online: http:\/\/ceta.enat.be\/?view=rubl&amp;id=306&amp;id2=778).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40577","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The main beneficiaries of our research are the organisations that\u000a      commissioned the team to conduct consultancy projects or directly adopted\u000a      our forecasting methodologies and reports. This research has reached\u000a      organisations such as the European Commission, tourist destination\u000a      governments, industry associations and individual tourism-related\u000a      enterprises across the world. Based on the developed methodology (e.g.,\u000a      Song and Witt, 2000 and 2003, Li et al, 2006), the Surrey team (has been\u000a      commissioned by the Pacific Asia Tourism Association (PATA) to produce\u000a      annual tourism forecasting reports. The reports are made available to all\u000a      PATA members including over 80 governments, 50 airlines, airports and\u000a      cruise lines and hundreds of travel companies around the world. The\u000a      research team have been invited to give over 50 presentations at\u000a      international conferences and workshops, and attended various media\u000a      releases of the commissioned projects over the past 10 years.\u000a    To date, over 370 tourism-related organisations and government agencies\u000a      from 39 countries have subscribed to the system.\u000a    Accurate tourism forecasts provide a scientific foundation for\u000a      formulating tourism policies (e.g., planning investments in\u000a      infrastructure, marketing resource allocation and tourist taxation) and\u000a      business strategies (e.g., operation management and new product\u000a      development). The common benefit these organisations gained is strongly\u000a      associated with the improved effectiveness of their strategic planning and\u000a      the reduced risks of decision failures. Below are some examples of the\u000a      impacts of our research.\u000a    PATA annual forecasting reports supports tourism policy change and\u000a      improved corporate planning. Many tourist destination governments use PATA\u000a      forecasts as a key reference to assist their tourism planning and revising\u000a      tourism policies (letter of support from PATA). For example, the\u000a      Philippines Department of Tourism revised their tourism strategy according\u000a      to PATA forecasts. It is noted explicitly in their tourism policy that \"to\u000a        achieve the projected growth in tourist numbers and expenditures\u000a      over the next decade, the Central Philippines will have to move to an\u000a      investment-driven strategy\".\u000a    Cathy Pacific is another example that applied the findings of the PATA\u000a      forecasting report (2011), which highlighted emerging, fast-growing\u000a      tourist markets and destinations. As a direct result Cathy Pacific\u000a      announced a new expansion in 2012: to add about 1,000 cabin crew, 300\u000a      pilots and 600 ground staff to those popular routes in order to \"meet\u000a        rising demand\". Consequently, the passenger revenue increased by\u000a      3.5% compared to 2011 despite the increase of fuel prices. The more\u000a      accurate tourism forecasts provided by Surrey's research ensure a solid\u000a      basis and greater confidence for Cathy Pacific's successful strategic\u000a      planning.\u000a    The web-based forecasting system supports improved tourism operation\u000a      management. Since 2011 Hong Kong Disneyland (HKD) has built its attendance\u000a      demand projection model by applying the forecasts provided by the\u000a      Surrey-designed system. HKD benefited from the system in two major areas:\u000a      attendance projection and pricing execution. In addition, the system\u000a      allowed HKD to quickly react to the changing business environment and\u000a      business needs. According to the letter of support from HKD, by using\u000a      better quality forecasts of arrivals the Park Operations team has been\u000a      able to significantly improve the level of guest satisfaction (by 5\u000a      percentage points to 80% overall in 2012). In the same year HKD generated\u000a      record revenues of HK$4,272 million, 18% higher than 2011, and a net\u000a      profit of HK$109 million, the first annual profit since the resort's\u000a      opening.\u000a    Finally, the application of the methodologies developed has allowed the\u000a      Surrey team to assess the demand for accessible tourism across Europe,\u000a      responding to the European Parliament's Preparatory Action \"Tourism\u000a      Accessibility for All\". While the impact of this project is yet to be\u000a      felt, the impact of the methodological work described above is in being\u000a      able to bring more advanced understanding to other areas of tourism\u000a      demand.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Surrey has a longstanding reputation in the world of\u000a      tourism demand modelling and forecasting research.

Since the 1990s the research in\u000a      this area has become increasingly active, led by a research team\u000a      consisting of Prof Haiyan Song (employed from 1997-2004 and Visiting\u000a      Professor thereafter), Prof Stephen Witt (employed from 1998-2004 and\u000a      Emeritus Professor thereafter) and Dr Gang Li (employed since 2003). The\u000a      research team have still retained close collaborations since the departure\u000a      of Prof Haiyan Song to Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU), and\u000a      Surrey, led by Dr Li, has continued to play a significant role in the\u000a      collaborative research.\u000a    Over the past 15 years, Surrey's research team have been making\u000a      continuous endeavours to advance tourism demand modelling and forecasting\u000a      methodologies to improve the explanatory power and forecast accuracy of\u000a      tourism demand models. For example, the team has introduced the\u000a      general-to-specific approach to tourism demand modelling, which is a\u000a      scientific procedure to identify significant influencing factors of\u000a      tourism demand (see Song and Witt, 2000; 2003). In addition, the team has\u000a      developed a number of advanced econometric models including the\u000a      time-varying-parameter (TVP) model, TVP almost ideal demand system (AIDS)\u000a      models, and TVP structural time series models (Li et al, 2005). Scientific\u000a      evidence shows that the above TVP methods improved tourism forecast\u000a      accuracy significantly (Song and Li, 2008). Meanwhile, the combination\u000a      between the AIDS model and more advanced econometric techniques leads to\u000a      more powerful tools for international tourism demand analysis. The above\u000a      models represent the most advanced econometric methods for tourism demand\u000a      modelling and forecasting in the present literature. Much of this research\u000a      programme won public funding from sources such as the Hong Kong government\u000a      and European Commission during the period 2003-2013.\u000a    A recent methodological innovation is the development of a web-based\u000a      forecasting system for Hong Kong inbound tourism. It is the first and\u000a      still the only online tourism forecasting system in the world. Launched in\u000a      2008, this innovation is based on a two-step rigorous methodology\u000a      including statistical forecasting and judgemental forecasting. The\u000a      statistical forecasting methodology of the system was developed at Surrey\u000a      (e.g., Song and Witt, 2000; Li, et al., 2005), and we continue to play a\u000a      key role in further development of the project. The system provides\u000a      forecasts of Hong Kong inbound tourist arrivals and expenditures, hotel\u000a      room nights and occupancy rates. The user-friendly web interface enables\u000a      non-expert users to access the instantly updated forecasts, and to adjust\u000a      the forecasts based on their own judgement. Such an intelligent,\u000a      interactive forecasting system greatly benefits tourism-related\u000a      organisations' strategic decision making and relevant policy making.\u000a    Currently Surrey is undertaking a European Commission funded project on\u000a      forecasting the demand for accessible tourism in Europe, based on which\u000a      the economic impact of accessible tourism will be estimated too. The\u000a      development of the methodology is based on the combination of forecasting\u000a      methods described in Section 2.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40591","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    (a) Introducing new evidence-based concepts to policy-makers and\u000a          the public (2007-2009)\u000a    This body of work coined the terms `demonstration effect' and `festival\u000a      effect', and introduced them into the UK legacy policy discourse, both\u000a      through the immediate users commissioning the research (eg DoH, Sport\u000a      England) and through intermediate users engaging with the work (eg\u000a      regional development agencies and local government). As such, the use of\u000a      these terms in policy documents or discourse can be directly attributed to\u000a      the SPEAR work (6). While the initial ESRC seminar series\u000a      contributed to the debate about the potential for legacies outside London\u000a      among immediate users involved in the series and among end users among the\u000a      wider public through the national press (eg The Guardian, 10\/8\/2007), the\u000a      significance of the work in informing policy was first highlighted in the\u000a      government's national physical activity plan in 2009 (7). This plan cited\u000a      interim findings as providing the \"best available international evidence\u000a      [to] maximis[e] the opportunities in the run-up to the 2012 Games and will\u000a      be used to guide the development of the regional 2012 health legacy plans\u000a      across England\" (p.51).\u000a    (b) Informing national government policies and programmes\u000a          (2009-2011)\u000a    In 2009, in a major speech on physical activity policy (8) following the\u000a      delivery of SPEAR's systematic review report to the immediate user\u000a      (DoH), the Secretary of State, Andy Burnham, noted \"the evidence from past\u000a      sporting events suggests the Games are likely to have two distinct effects\u000a      on the general public. The first is the demonstration effect...[but] the\u000a      second effect &#8212; the festival effect &#8212; [is] crucial...This, for me, is the\u000a      effect we need to maximise.\" Given these effects, Burnham goes on to note\u000a      that \"It's vital we make full use of major sporting events as a catalyst\u000a      which is why I want to start a dialogue with sports governing bodies. With\u000a      Ben Bradshaw [Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport], I want to\u000a      work with them to develop physical activity legacy plans alongside the\u000a      sports legacy plans they have to promote physical activity before, during\u000a      and after the event &#8212; to maximise the `festival effect' of this golden\u000a      decade.\" Burnham goes on to list a range of initiatives in dance, walking,\u000a      cycling and swimming that will seek to harness the festival effect\u000a      identified by SPEAR's research, including:\u000a    i) The addition of Dance4Life and Play4Life sub brands to Change4Life\u000a    ii) The establishment of a Dance Champions Group, including Strictly Come\u000a      Dancing personalities Arlene Phillips (judge), Angela Rippon (former host)\u000a      and Lisa Snowdon (former contestant).\u000a    iii) A Walking for Health 2012 campaign with Natural England to deliver\u000a      200k people more active.\u000a    iv) A national programme of cycling opportunities similar to the Sky\u000a      sponsored Skyline events.\u000a    v) An additional &#163;1m to allow councils not yet signed up for the free\u000a      swimming initiative to do so.\u000a    This clearly represents a significant range of initiatives developed by\u000a      the immediate research user with a clear reach to impact upon intermediate\u000a      and end users. Furthermore, Burnham's speech demonstrates that, although SPEAR's\u000a      research may not have directly stimulated these initiatives, it did\u000a      provide significant evidence for the purpose and direction that the\u000a      initiatives should take, with Burnham concluding \"So August 2019, we come\u000a      back to this room. Successful events staged. A rack of medals and even a\u000a      couple of big trophies won. Great memories. But the biggest prize &#8212;\u000a      everybody more active than they were.\"\u000a    Although the prevailing economic climate and the change of government in\u000a      2010 led to the scaling-back of some of these initiatives, there were\u000a      clear programme changes informed by the research in 2009-10, and these\u000a      also impacted on end users at the time (ii, v), whilst those that survived\u000a      the change of government (i) or did so on a smaller scale (iii, iv)\u000a      continued to impact upon end users from 2010. In fact, the research\u000a      retained influence among immediate users in the new government, with the\u000a      Coalition's Plans for the Legacy of the 2012 Games (9) noting that \"the\u000a      Responsibility Deal for Public Health will draw upon the `festival effect'\u000a      of the Games to encourage healthy, active lifestyles\" (p.5), and the\u000a      Minister for Sport, Hugh Robertson, reporting in Parliament that Weed's\u000a      Sport England report had guided his assessment of the relationship between\u000a      elite level sport and mass participation in sport at grassroots level\u000a      (10). Robertson also noted that UK Sport was currently finalising research\u000a      into the inspirational effects of major sports events, research\u000a      commissioned from a partnership between SPEAR and Sheffield Hallam\u000a      University in 2011. Similarly, in endorsing the use of Active Celebration\u000a      in the NHS Sport &amp; Physical Activity Challenge, Anne Milton, the\u000a      Minister for Public Health, commented that SPEAR's evidence-based\u000a      guide \"is a key resource...to create a lasting legacy of healthier, more\u000a      active communities\" (11).\u000a    Examples of intermediate users of the SPEAR research at the\u000a      national level have been SportCoachUK, who cite SPEAR's systematic\u000a      review (p.2) as underpinning their coaching legacy strategy (12), and the\u000a      Scottish Physical Activity and Health Alliance, who advocate the use of\u000a      Active Celebration to develop legacies from the 2014 Commonwealth Games in\u000a      Glasgow (13). SPEAR's systematic review was also directly\u000a      considered in the Culture, Media and Sport Commons Select Committee's\u000a      report on the legacy of the 2012 Games (14).\u000a    (c) Informing regional and local plans, programmes and activities\u000a          (2010-2012)\u000a    Through the DoH's regional physical activity network, SPEAR's\u000a      research, particularly the evidence-based guide, Active Celebration,\u000a      achieved considerable reach among intermediate users in regional and local\u000a      government across England, with SPEAR staff running over 20\u000a      workshops on the implementation of the findings at local level in all\u000a      English regions from 2010 to 2012. In just one example, SPEAR's\u000a      research is noted (pp.10-11) as underpinning Inspire North West: The\u000a      Health and Wellbeing Framework for the 2012 Games (15), and similar\u000a      references can be found in the strategies and frameworks of the other\u000a      English regions. Furthermore, despite the scaling-back of initiatives at\u000a      national level following the formation of the Coalition government in\u000a      2010, Active Celebration continued to reach intermediate users &#8212; local\u000a      health and physical activity promotion practitioners &#8212; throughout England,\u000a      from Hampshire in the South (16) to North Yorkshire in the North East (17)\u000a      and, of course, in London, where one Borough alone invested &#163;90k in the\u000a      initiative (18). While there is no systematic evaluation of the detail of\u000a      the impact of this research on end users (the least active and sedentary\u000a      members of the public), its continued use to inform the activities and\u000a      programmes developed by local health practitioners and professionals as\u000a      intermediate users suggests that it has important reach and likely\u000a      significance for such end users.\u000a    (d) Holding government policy to account and informing\u000a          international debate (2010-2013)\u000a    Since the change of government in 2010 and the rationalisation of sport\u000a      participation legacy policy, SPEAR's research has been used to\u000a      highlight shortcomings in national policy, particularly the lack of any\u000a      meaningful policies to use the 2012 Games to stimulate demand, thus\u000a      stimulating public debate among end users of the research to help hold\u000a      government policy to account. Particularly following the publication of\u000a      Places People Play, the government's Mass Participation Legacy Plan, but\u000a      also before this, critiques of government policy directly featuring SPEAR's\u000a      research have featured in, inter alia, The Times (18\/12\/2010), The\u000a      Telegraph (20\/5\/2010), and the British Medical Journal (23\/6\/2011) and,\u000a      internationally, in The New York Times (15\/2\/2011), The Washington Post\u000a      (28\/3\/2011), and the Canadian Medical Association Journal (19\/4\/2011). Weed\u000a      has featured in several TV documentaries, in which SPEAR research\u000a      has been used to directly challenge the former Olympics Minister, Tessa\u000a      Jowell (Sky News, 19\/12\/2010) and the current Minister for Sport, Hugh\u000a      Robertson (BBC One, 25\/2\/2011) about their policies for Olympic sport\u000a      legacies, and this has been supplemented by over 30 similar appearances on\u000a      local and national radio (2010-2013). As such, this body of work has\u000a      managed to achieve the somewhat unlikely dual outcome of both informing\u000a      government policy and holding government policy to account.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In 2005 London secured the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games following\u000a      a promise the Games would \"inspire a new generation to choose sport\".

This was the first grant\u000a      awarded by the ESRC on the subject of the 2012 Games. Following this, in\u000a      2008 the DoH (Physical Activity Co-ordinators Group) commissioned SPEAR\u000a      by competitive tender to undertake a worldwide evidence review to underpin\u000a      the development of physical activity legacies from London 2012 (3), and\u000a      this commission was extended in 2009 to include the development of an\u000a      evidence based guide (5).

As a result of the impact of this body of work, Weed\u000a      was invited to write a commentary for the British Medical Journal on the\u000a      impact of the Games on health (2), the online version of which has been\u000a      accessed over 3,400 times.

In particular, the potential to leverage pre-Games\u000a      `pregnancy' (as opposed to post-Games legacy) benefits, particularly in\u000a      terms of physical activity and sport participation, was being missed.\u000a    Prior to the body of work described here, received wisdom fell into two\u000a      camps: firstly, among cynics, that London 2012 could not deliver a\u000a      physical activity and sport participation legacy as no previous Games had\u000a      done so; secondly, among those positive about such legacies, that elite\u000a      sport universally inspires non-participants to try sport. SPEAR's\u000a      systematic review of worldwide evidence (1,3) demonstrated that both of\u000a      these perspectives are flawed. Firstly, the SPEAR review showed\u000a      that, while it is true that no previous Games has resulted in population\u000a      level increases in physical activity or sport participation and thus there\u000a      is no evidence for an inherent effect, no previous Games has developed\u000a      systematic programmes or strategies that seek to use a Games to increase\u000a      population level physical activity or sport participation. As such, there\u000a      are no previous examples of Games that have attempted to deliver such\u000a      legacies. However, there were examples of specific interventions that had\u000a      shown positive outcomes at the initiative level, but that were not on a\u000a      scale that would affect population level participation data (2,3). This\u000a      initiative level data allowed SPEAR to identify two processes by\u000a      which a Games might affect physical activity and sport participation:\u000a    (i) Demonstration Effect &#8212; elite sport, sports people and sports\u000a      events can encourage those who participate a little to participate a\u000a      little more, and can encourage those who have participated in the past to\u000a      participate again. However, this effect cannot inspire those who are not\u000a      interested in sport to participate &#8212; in fact, it can have a negative\u000a      effect in deterring such people from participating as a result of a\u000a      perceived `competence gap' (3).\u000a    (ii) Festival Effect &#8212; events on the scale of the Olympic Games\u000a      create in people a desire, if not an urge, to be part of the celebrations\u000a      of the event, and this effect is enhanced if the event is promoted as\u000a      bigger than and beyond sport. Thus, among the least active and sedentary\u000a      who are disinterested in sport, a festival effect can be harnessed to\u000a      encourage active celebration of the Games whilst de-emphasising sporting\u000a      and health messages that may be off-putting (1,3).\u000a    SPEAR's work showed that each effect is dependent on a positive\u000a      attitude towards the hosting of the Games among those targeted, and that\u000a      they are most powerful in the run up to the Games capitalising on\u000a      anticipation, rather than in the Games aftermath capitalising on memory\u000a      (1,2,3).\u000a    Subsequent analysis of national participation data for Sport England (4)\u000a      showed that around 25% of England's adult sporting population (those who\u000a      have played at least once in the last year) are responsive to a\u000a      demonstration effect, but this rises to 35% among those who are not club\u000a      members and participate less than twice a week (ie, those most likely to\u000a      be the targets of policy to increase participation). This data allowed an\u000a      analysis of Sport England's market segments to identify target groups to\u000a      be identified for demonstration effect initiatives as part of the\u000a      production of an evidence based guide for the Department of Health (DoH)\u000a      (5). This analysis showed that segments could be identified that included\u000a      15% of the population, but in which 40% would be those responsive to a\u000a      demonstration effect (4,5). A similar analysis was undertaken of the DoH's\u000a      Change 4 Life Family Clusters to identify which clusters would be most\u000a      responsive to festival effects. These analyses were used to match target\u000a      groups to potential initiatives (5).\u000a    This work was carried out at CCCU (2006 - 2010) by Prof Weed\u000a      (2006 -), Readers Chatziefstathiou (2005 -) and Wellard\u000a      (2003 -) and Dowse (2008 -) (all included in REF1), plus Fiore\u000a      (PhD student 2008-2012), Coren (submitted in UoA3) and Mansfield (1995 - 2011).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40592","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    (a) Providing a rationale for investment (immediate users)\u000d\u000a      Jane Ellison, the Minister for Public Health, noted in November 2013 (5)\u000d\u000a      that SPEAR's research\u000d\u000a      on Change4Life Clubs \"demonstrates the value of these clubs\", and used SPEAR's\u000d\u000a      data on\u000d\u000a      physical activity increases as a rationale for existing and continued\u000d\u000a      investment in 13,500 school\u000d\u000a      Change4Life Clubs.

However, in 2012\/13 the releases also\u000d\u000a      included SPEAR's insights on\u000d\u000a      the importance of stronger club links, particularly the awareness of such\u000d\u000a      links among pupils, who\u000d\u000a      are important in promoting the clubs through word of mouth to their\u000d\u000a      friends, and noting that less\u000d\u000a      than a quarter of NSSW participants who joined new clubs were able to join\u000d\u000a      a club directly linked to\u000d\u000a      their school (8).

As\u000d\u000a      such, rather than the\u000d\u000a      received wisdom that efforts should focus on `girl-friendly' sports, the\u000d\u000a      research suggested greater\u000d\u000a      benefits would be achieved by making sport and physical activity more\u000d\u000a      `child-friendly' and `youth\u000d\u000a      friendly'. Specifically, that fun, health, social interaction and skill\u000d\u000a      development should be prioritised\u000d\u000a      over sporting outcomes, and that the problem lies not with girls, or\u000d\u000a      indeed other less active young\u000d\u000a      people, themselves, but with the way in which physical activities are\u000d\u000a      constructed and presented.\u000d\u000a      More novel activities, which do not come with pre-conceptions about how\u000d\u000a      they have previously\u000d\u000a      been presented and delivered within schools, were suggested as having\u000d\u000a      particular potential.\u000d\u000a    However, the primary underpinning research for this case study are 5\u000d\u000a      evaluations of NSSW (2,4)\u000d\u000a      and 3 evaluations of Change4Life School Sport Clubs (3,4). The research\u000d\u000a      showed that the\u000d\u000a      programmes had impressive reach, with over 9 million young people taking\u000d\u000a      part in NSSWs (2010-2013) (2), and approaching quarter of a million young\u000d\u000a      people joining one of the 8,000+\u000d\u000a      Change4Life Clubs (3); however, more significant is the impact on the less\u000d\u000a      active. While 60% of all\u000d\u000a      participants in NSSW 2012 said they wanted to do more sport following the\u000d\u000a      week, two-thirds of\u000d\u000a      primary and half of secondary pupils that rarely participated in sports\u000d\u000a      outside PE, said NSSW\u000d\u000a      made them want to do more sport. A 6 month follow-up showed that 91% of\u000d\u000a      participants who said\u000d\u000a      they wanted to do more sport were actually doing more 6 months later.\u000d\u000a      Based on a sample of over\u000d\u000a      4,500 directly surveyed 8-15 year olds, analysis by age and activity level\u000d\u000a      showed that themes of\u000d\u000a      novelty, fun and learning about new sports were more attractive to the\u000d\u000a      less active. However, less\u000d\u000a      than 25% of pupils who joined clubs in new sports were able to join a club\u000d\u000a      linked to their school.\u000d\u000a      Qualitative insights showed that a key attraction was the perception of\u000d\u000a      ownership and choice about\u000d\u000a      what activities to do, which was contrasted with PE lessons, and that\u000d\u000a      recommendations from\u000d\u000a      friends was a key factor in joining new clubs in sports tried during the\u000d\u000a      week. Finally, GIS analysis of\u000d\u000a      registration data showed that while overall numbers of schools\u000d\u000a      participating in the programme were\u000d\u000a      relatively stable, there was a high rate of turnover and a low rate of\u000d\u000a      retention, with teacher surveys\u000d\u000a      suggesting that schools actively weighed the benefits of participation\u000d\u000a      each year against other\u000d\u000a      potential initiatives, rather than simply re-registering because they had\u000d\u000a      done so in the past.\u000d\u000a    Over the 3 years of secondary Change4Life Clubs, 110,000 young people\u000d\u000a      participated, of whom\u000d\u000a      98,000 are now positive about sport and choosing to play weekly, including\u000d\u000a      71% of those formerly\u000d\u000a      least active (3,4). Over 90% of participants said they now feel more\u000d\u000a      confident doing sport and\u000d\u000a      enjoy PE more. However, the first year evaluation showed that the reach of\u000d\u000a      clubs among the less\u000d\u000a      active could be doubled if less active pupils were more effectively\u000d\u000a      targeted, and that poorly defined\u000d\u000a      exit routes to appropriate participation pathways were creating a\u000d\u000a      bottleneck that restricted turnover\u000d\u000a      and new member recruitment. The primary Change4Life Clubs, introduced a\u000d\u000a      year later, learned the\u000d\u000a      lessons of the first year of the secondary programme, with 85% of\u000d\u000a      recruited members being less\u000d\u000a      active.

For instance, in 2009,\u000a      the Department of Health issued a good practice guide for `Provision of\u000a        adult balance services' that included input from Dr Pavlou. Within\u000a      this, citing Pavlou 2004, they stated that \"Innovative technology has been\u000a      highlighted by the Government as critically important in delivering\u000a      services for 21st century healthcare.\" As such, they recommend that all\u000a      supra-specialist centres should have access to dynamic visual stimulation\u000a      equipment (1).\u000a    Work at KCL has established that customised vestibular rehabilitation via\u000a      a DVD that incorporates visual motion exposure is an effective treatment\u000a      for people with dizziness and is particularly effective for improving\u000a      symptoms of VV. Most importantly, the DVD makes this type of treatment\u000a      accessible to all balance centres, not just supra-specialist ones and,\u000a      when used under supervision of a trained professional, is as effective as\u000a      the use of expensive and high-tech equipment. There are approximately 160\u000a      physiotherapists with an interest in vestibular rehabilitation across the\u000a      United Kingdom, with each seeing between 1-20 patients weekly. Currently\u000a      the DVD is being used in around 30 rehabilitation centres in the UK by\u000a      both NHS and private clinicians. Experts at the National Hospital for\u000a      Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London will attest to the use of\u000a      this DVD for their patients (2). KCL has copyrighted the DVD and it is now\u000a      available for purchase (3). There is a recognised need for this tool in\u000a      that a poll carried out by KCL researchers at the conference of the\u000a      Association of Chartered Physiotherapists with an interest in Vestibular\u000a      Rehabilitation in May 2012 found that of 70 participating physiotherapists\u000a      who treated VV symptoms, 80% said they would like to use the visual motion\u000a      DVD together with Google images, an optokinetic drum or virtual reality\u000a      (4). The Vestibular Rehabilitation Special Interest Group of the American\u000a      Physical Therapy Association has details on how to purchase the DVD on\u000a      their website following multiple requests by its members (5).\u000a    Through training sessions at relevant meetings, the work of KCL\u000a      researchers in assessing and treating VV has been disseminated to\u000a      clinicians both inside and outside of the UK. These involve a lecture\u000a      followed by a number of practical elements including case studies,\u000a      exposure to the optokinetic stimuli and appropriate types of exercises,\u000a      along with discussion of patient presentation, subjective symptom reports\u000a      and factors affecting outcome. Training sessions have occurred at UK\u000a      meetings of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery Dizziness\u000a      Course (November 2010, June 2013); Royal College of Medicine (March 2012);\u000a      the British Society of Audiology (annually) and the Association of\u000a      Chartered Physiotherapists with an interest in Neurology or Vestibular\u000a      rehabilitation in 2011 and 2012.

The 2011 `International Guidelines for Education in Vestibular\u000a      Rehabilitation Therapy' (VRT) has a number of clinical science\u000a      recommendations and state that for VRT therapists to be able to properly\u000a      evaluate, treat and manage the care of patients with vestibular disorders\u000a      they need an understanding of \"the clinical problems with which these\u000a      patients present.\" One of the areas of understanding with regard to\u000a      \"visual-vestibular interaction and the effects of apparent visual motion\u000a      in patients with vestibular impairments\" cites Pavlou 2006 as the sole\u000a      source of recommendation to fulfil this educational need (7). The 2012\u000a      Handbook of Clinical Neurology series includes a volume on Neurological\u000a      Rehabilitation, which is described as `a definitive review of current\u000a      neurorehabilitation practice' aimed at `a wide range of clinicians and\u000a      scientists.' Dr Pavlou, along with Professor Bronstein at Imperial College\u000a      London authored the chapter on Balance, which includes reference to Pavlou\u000a      2013 and cites Pavlou 2004 and 2006 with regards to incorporation of\u000a      optokinetic stimulation into balance rehabilitation programmes (8). Pavlou\u000a      2006, along with Pavlou 2011, is also cited in a fact sheet on VV produced\u000a      by the American Physical Therapy Association aimed at general physicians\u000a      (9) and in a podcast on VV organised by the same association with Dr\u000a      Pavlou and Dr Jeffrey Staab as the invited speakers (10).

Vestibular rehabilitation is the standard of\u000a      care for patients with vestibular dysfunction, with 50-80% of individuals\u000a      completing a customised programme achieving significant improvements.\u000a      Visual vertigo (VV) is a specific form of chronic dizziness whereby\u000a      symptoms occur due to an over-reliance on visual cues for posture and\u000a      orientation (i.e. visual dependence). Symptoms can be provoked by\u000a      disorienting visual environments such as crowds, supermarket aisles,\u000a      watching repetitive moving scenes on television or travelling on an\u000a      escalator. However VV symptoms do not improve with customised vestibular\u000a      exercises alone.\u000a    Since 2000, Dr Marousa Pavlou (2003-present, Lecturer in Physiotherapy)\u000a      at KCL, together with Professor Adolfo Bronstein at Imperial College\u000a      London have carried out research to improve the management of VV symptoms.\u000a      They initially investigated whether exposure to dynamic visual motion\u000a      (optokinetic stimulation &#8212; OKS) would promote desensitisation. Using a\u000a      \"hi-tech\" approach with inertial and visual motion simulators they found a\u000a      75% improvement in VV symptoms (as provoked by walking down supermarket\u000a      aisles) after 8 weeks of treatment (n = 40) (Pavlou M, et al. 2004). In a\u000a      study seeking to investigate the mechanism by which OKS works, KCL\u000a      researchers exposed 26 healthy subjects to OKS over 5 days. Results showed\u000a      that this form of therapy significantly reduced visual dependency, the\u000a      main aetiology of VV symptoms, hence confirming the validity of OKS for\u000a      this group of patients (Pavlou M, et al. 2011). In a subsequent study, KCL\u000a      researchers identified that the presence and severity of VV symptoms could\u000a      effectively be identified using a simple questionnaire (the Situational\u000a      Characteristics Questionnaire &#8212; SCQ) compared to more expensive,\u000a      cumbersome laboratory methods (i.e. Computerised Dynamic Posturography,\u000a      approximate cost &#163;80,000). The SCQ is a 19 question tool that queries how\u000a      frequently symptoms are provoked or exacerbated in environments with\u000a      visual-vestibular conflict or intense visual motion (e.g. supermarket\u000a      aisles) (Pavlou M, et al. 2006).\u000a    Wanting to make this type of physiotherapy treatment accessible to all\u000a      balance centres, and not just supra-specialist ones, Dr Pavlou initiated a\u000a      RCT to evaluate the responses to treatments that incorporated optokinetic\u000a      training via either a) a full-field visual environment rotator, b)\u000a      a DVD with supervision or c) a DVD without supervision. This clinical\u000a      trial showed no differences between groups with all showing significant\u000a      improvements in functional gait and VV symptoms. This provided evidence\u000a      that treatment was equally successful when optokinetic stimulation was\u000a      provided via a DVD. Whilst it would be most convenient and economical for\u000a      this DVD to be supplied directly to patients, this trial identified a\u000a      significantly higher dropout rate in the unsupervised groups, underlining\u000a      the importance of supervision. This study therefore indicated that the\u000a      DVD, when used under supervision, is an effective and economical method of\u000a      integrating visual motion into vestibular rehabilitation (Pavlou M, et al.\u000a      2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41268","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The bio-analytical research in forensic drug analysis by King's College\u000d\u000a      London (KCL) researchers into the testing of sports competitors for\u000d\u000a      prohibited substances has been recognised as world-leading.

These\u000d\u000a      include novel high resolution mass spectrometric screening method for all\u000d\u000a      of the urine samples (Musenga 2013) and the improved isotope ratio mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometric method for confirmatory testing of all samples where there\u000d\u000a      was suspicion of endogenous steroid administration (Brailsford 2012). In a\u000d\u000a      letter of support, the GSK Director for this operation writes that: \"As\u000d\u000a        the Drug Control Centre has been in the forefront of introducing\u000d\u000a        advances in anti-doping science for many years, we were particularly\u000d\u000a        impressed by their analytical chemistry ability which is evidenced by\u000d\u000a        their publication record, especially in such challenging areas as\u000d\u000a        quantitative handling of basic compounds, working with minor\u000d\u000a        contaminants such as those found in contraceptive steroids and the\u000d\u000a        application of biomarkers at an evidential forensic level\" (5).\u000d\u000a    The unprecedented scale of the anti-doping operation at London 2012 is\u000d\u000a      demonstrated by statistics revealing that over 5,000 athletes' samples\u000d\u000a      were tested during the Olympics and a further 1,400 during the Paralympic\u000d\u000a      Games, equating to almost 50% of the competitors and including all medal\u000d\u000a      winners. Working in a highly regulated environment, where confidentiality\u000d\u000a      and security were paramount at all times, DCC staff demonstrated their\u000d\u000a      track record of quality and delivery. Both these attributes came to the\u000d\u000a      fore in an environment that mandated not only a rapid turnaround of\u000d\u000a      results, but also accurate identification of prohibited substances and\u000d\u000a      interpretation of the findings. Indeed, unequivocal identification is\u000d\u000a      essential, since laboratory findings may be the subject of prolonged and\u000d\u000a      intense legal scrutiny. Negative analytical findings were securely\u000d\u000a      reported no later than 24 hours of receipt at the laboratory and even\u000d\u000a      adverse analytical findings were reported within very short time-frames.\u000d\u000a      The latest research on the interpretation and application of the human\u000d\u000a      growth hormone (hGH) biomarker projects described above were accepted by\u000d\u000a      WADA and resulted in the undisputed disqualification of two Paralympic\u000d\u000a      athletes for hGH misuse, as described in the letter from USADA (1).\u000d\u000a    The procedures set up at the ADSC for the London Olympic Games created a\u000d\u000a      base of knowledge around operations and processes. As such, the DCC is\u000d\u000a      currently working with scientists who will set up a similar laboratory in\u000d\u000a      Rio de Janeiro for their 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games (6). The DCC\u000d\u000a      also continuously works with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD), providing\u000d\u000a      assistance through their research and expertise. In a letter of support,\u000d\u000a      the Chief Executive of UKAD testifies that \"the Drug Control Centre is\u000d\u000a        the current provider of comprehensive analytical services to\u000d\u000a        UK-Anti-Doping and has demonstrated not only its ability to provide\u000d\u000a        consistent tests but also its commitment to lead the science behind\u000d\u000a        anti-doping testing.\" He goes on to describe how UKAD has \"valued\u000d\u000a        the advice and experience of the DCC\" and how they are \"experienced\u000d\u000a        in presenting its analytical results at athlete hearings, appeals and\u000d\u000a        courts of law both nationally and internationally\" (7).\u000d\u000a    In partnership with GSK, the DCC has delivered further impact based on\u000d\u000a      its drug monitoring programme role through public outreach programmes such\u000d\u000a      as \"Scientists in Sport\" (8). These encompass the promotion of anti-doping\u000d\u000a      messages as well as chemistry and science within schools and the broader\u000d\u000a      community through visits to\/presentations at both the Harlow Olympic\u000d\u000a      testing facility and the DCC laboratories at KCL.

This\u000d\u000a      operation, undertaken in their World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA)\u000d\u000a      accredited laboratories, was characterised by unprecedented scale, speed\u000d\u000a      and accuracy. It succeeded in protecting the health of athletes and the\u000d\u000a      integrity of the Games. KCL was chosen to undertake the 24\/7 anti-doping\u000d\u000a      operation based on its cutting-edge bio-analytical research in drug\u000d\u000a      control. Although a number of athletes were disqualified in the pre-Games\u000d\u000a      testing, the deterrent effect of the KCL work was evidenced by the few\u000d\u000a      doping cases during the Games itself.

The underpinning research has been led\u000d\u000a      by Professor David Cowan, Director of the DCC since 1990, and has resulted\u000d\u000a      in the development of new and improved analytical approaches for the\u000d\u000a      detection of a number of prohibited substances in sports. This research\u000d\u000a      has also involved Dr Andrew Kicman (1990-present, Head of Research &amp;\u000d\u000a      Development Group), Dr Norman Smith (2002-present, Senior Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow), Dr Alan Brailsford (2004-present, Post-Doctoral Analyst), Dr\u000d\u000a      Ivana Gavrilovic (2007-present, Post-Doctoral Research Analyst), Dr\u000d\u000a      Alessandro Musenga (2010-present, Post-Doctoral Analyst), Dr Mark Parkin\u000d\u000a      (2005-present, Lecturer in Analytical Science) and Dr Christopher Walker\u000d\u000a      (1986-present, Senior Analyst).\u000d\u000a    Key examples of cutting-edge bioanalytical research undertaken at the DCC\u000d\u000a      to deter drug misuse have included the development and application of the\u000d\u000a      first tests for stimulants (such as amphetamines), anabolic steroids and\u000d\u000a      the protein hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin, as well as the\u000d\u000a      development of more complex tests to confirm administration of the\u000d\u000a      naturally produced anabolic steroid 5&#945;-dihydrotestosterone.\u000d\u000a    Human Growth Hormone (hGH): In collaboration with the University\u000d\u000a      of Southampton, work on hGH detection has been pursued to develop a\u000d\u000a      reliable biomarker approach for detection of misuse with a longer window\u000d\u000a      of detection than was provided by existing approaches\u000d\u000a      (Erotokritou-Mulligan I, et al. 2009). This includes\u000d\u000a      characterising physiological variability of two markers of exogenously\u000d\u000a      administered hGH: insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and pro-collagen\u000d\u000a      type III N-terminal peptide. For this work, DCC scientists were essential\u000d\u000a      in helping plan the research from the anti-doping perspective and\u000d\u000a      performing all of the analytical measurements. World Anti-Doping Agency's\u000d\u000a      (WADA) accreditation of the DCC was an essential part of making the\u000d\u000a      approach legally defensible for anti-doping work. The development of\u000d\u000a      ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography\/tandem mass spectrometry for\u000d\u000a      quantifying IGF-1 is helping further to enhance detection methodology.\u000d\u000a    Nandrolone: In a study funded by the United States Anti-Doping\u000d\u000a      Agency, scientists at the DCC refined the detection of misuse of this\u000d\u000a      anabolic steroid by using state of the art gas chromatography-tandem mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometry to define the upper limits for urinary 19-norandrosterone\u000d\u000a      (19-NA), the principal urinary metabolite of nandrolone. This research was\u000d\u000a      undertaken on samples taken from a large cohort of healthy women not\u000d\u000a      taking anabolic steroids but including those using permitted\u000d\u000a      contraceptives containing norethisterone (Walker CJ, et al. 2009).\u000d\u000a      These important results confirmed that the WADA revised threshold for\u000d\u000a      19-NA for females was acceptable, negating the need for a more complex\u000d\u000a      approach for 19-NA analysis. New techniques have also been developed to\u000d\u000a      enable the administration of nandrolone to be distinguished from the oral\u000d\u000a      contraceptive norethisterone.\u000d\u000a    In additional work, KCL researchers have improved the ability to detect\u000d\u000a      the administration of naturally produced substances, especially the male\u000d\u000a      hormone testosterone, by using chemically synthesised molecularly\u000d\u000a      imprinted polymeric substances rather than using antibodies produced from\u000d\u000a      animals (Gavrilovi&#263; I, et al. 2011). They have also furthered the\u000d\u000a      development of combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry, including\u000d\u000a      sophisticated two-dimensional gas chromatography to simplify and improve\u000d\u000a      sample purification (Brailsford AD, et al. 2012).\u000d\u000a    Improvements achieved in both performance and efficiency of doping\u000d\u000a      control analysis include the development and validation of a simple, but\u000d\u000a      sensitive and rapid, analytical procedure based on flow cytometry to\u000d\u000a      detect human haemoglobin and haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers potentially\u000d\u000a      misused in endurance sports. KCL researchers have also developed methods\u000d\u000a      to deal with the quantification of difficult basic drugs such as\u000d\u000a      ephedrines (Gray N, et al. 2011) and a fast multi-analyte\u000d\u000a      screening method specifically developed for the detection of prohibited\u000d\u000a      xenobiotics in urine that allows the screening of several classes of\u000d\u000a      substance in a single chromatographic method with a very rapid run-time\u000d\u000a      (Musenga A, et al. 2013). These novel techniques proved invaluable\u000d\u000a      in the anti-doping analysis at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic\u000d\u000a      Games. Post Games, and of particular note, is the ability to review\u000d\u000a      archived data to be able to check for new `designer' drugs to see whether\u000d\u000a      athletes may have misused them under the WADA 8 year rule to be able to\u000d\u000a      re-investigate samples (Musenga A, et al. 2013).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42017","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    From 2008 onwards, the social, cultural and commercial impacts of these\u000a      themes of research are\u000a      evidenced by their influence on UK coaches, coach education practices, and\u000a      through professional\u000a      club and national governing body policies.\u000a    With respect to Theme 1: Directly from the original research work\u000a      at Loughborough [3.1, 3.2],\u000a      the Performance Environment Survey (PES) has reached into National\u000a      Governing Body policy and\u000a      significantly influenced methods of international team performance\u000a      assessment. Specifically, in\u000a      order to review and inform tournament preparation, the PES is now used as\u000a      part of FA Policy by\u000a      FA Club England and the National Coaches as a tournament evaluation tool.\u000a      Within point 120 in\u000a      the FA's (2011) Raising Our Game policy document, the FA states\u000a      \"Whilst The FA always seeks to\u000a      understand the reasons for disappointing results, and has collected\u000a      feedback previously from\u000a      coaching and playing squads, it should seek to go further in formally\u000a      collating qualitative and\u000a      quantitative feedback from all international squads to better understand\u000a      the successes and failures\u000a      of team environment and preparation from their perspective.\" This point is\u000a      acknowledged within\u000a      two of 25 recommendations summarized and reported by the FA from this\u000a      policy [5.8].\u000a      Subsequently, this process of tournament evaluation by players and the\u000a      role of the PES is\u000a      supported by a testimonial from the FA National Coach for the England\u000a      U-16's team [5.1].\u000a    With respect to Theme 2: From his original intervention research [3.3]\u000a      conducted at a single\u000a      youth academy, Harwood's 5C's programme and its principles and practices\u000a      have significantly\u000a      impacted upon the national approach of the FA towards its psychological\u000a      education of coaches and\u000a      clubs. Moreover knowledge of the 5C's is having an extensive reach into\u000a      1000's of coaches and\u000a      parents through direct promotion via FA channels. Specifically, the 5C's\u000a      now form the basis of the\u000a      FA Level 4 Psychology for Football education module for coaches. Based on\u000a      the delivery of mental\u000a      skills on the pitch, this national course has already served over 450\u000a      coaches from amateur youth\u000a      soccer, professional academies and centres of excellence. In further\u000a      support of this level 4 module,\u000a      the FA commissioned a coaches textbook based on the 5C's due to be\u000a      published by Harwood in\u000a      December 2013. In addition, the FA art and design team have worked with\u000a      Loughborough\u000a      University to create three 5C's educational wall posters for youth\u000a      football clubs, coaches and\u000a      parents. These wallposters have been distributed to 500 FA Charter\u000a      Standard football clubs in\u000a      conjunction with the creation of two FA webpages that have made these 5C\u000a      educational tips and\u000a      practices available for download by all registered coaches and visitors [5.7].\u000a      These 5C education\u000a      resources have been directly sent to 14,900 licensed coaches, and have\u000a      been promoted via\u000a      Twitter to 20,587 worldwide followers at #StGeorgesPark. To date, the\u000a      websites have been\u000a      accessed by 2456 unique visitors with over 1600 having actively downloaded\u000a      the 5C resources\u000a      [see 5.8]. This initiative is supported by the testimonial from\u000a      the FA Head of Player Development\u000a      [5.2].\u000a    The 5C principles have also influenced the development of the new FA\u000a      Advanced Youth Coaches\u000a      Award, established in 2012, and directly form the content of a textbook\u000a      and e-resource to support\u000a      the award. This is affirmed in a testimonial from the FA Director of Youth\u000a      Awards [5.3]. Finally, in\u000a      terms of internal impact within a professional club's long term player\u000a      development plan, the 5C's\u000a      philosophy is integrated within coach, player and parent education\u000a      policies at Nottingham Forest\u000a      FC and Leicester City FC. This integration of the 5C's approach is\u000a      documented in Nottingham\u000a      Forest's Player Development Strategy as an element of sport science\u000a      provision [see 5.6].\u000a    With respect to Theme 3: Harwood's research [3.4] on\u000a      psychological momentum revealed both\u000a      team and individual psychological strategies used by players and coaches\u000a      to maintain and regain\u000a      momentum during soccer games. Informed by this material, the resultant\u000a      professional textbook\u000a      `Momentum in Soccer' has been the core text for the FA Level 5 Psychology\u000a      for Football coach\u000a      education module. The book's framework focuses on how momentum within a\u000a      team is influenced\u000a      by individual and team factors, forming the structure of the three day\u000a      course. The book has sold\u000a      over 2300 copies to date with the course having served over 150 coaches\u000a      and support staff from\u000a      FA Academies, Centres of Excellence, Clubs and Schools since 2008. This\u000a      impact is confirmed\u000a      within the testimony from 5.2.\u000a    With respect to Theme 4: Cushion's research with CAIS in football\u000a      has led to the development of\u000a      a coach behaviour analysis software for use with tablet devices [see 5.10].\u000a      To date 20 software\u000a      licences have been sold. Axis Coaching Technology has been promoted to\u000a      1952 followers on\u000a      Twitter and has 450 signed up via LinkedIn.The software is being used\u000a      within professional football\u000a      at Leicester City FC, Southamption FC, Plymouth Argyle and Wigan Athletic\u000a      as part of continuing\u000a      professional development for coaching staff, coach behaviour evaluation\u000a      and informing the practice\u000a      environments created by coaches. This integration of the CAIS is\u000a      reinforced in testimony from\u000a      Academy Managers at Leicester City FC [5.4] and and Wigan Athletic\u000a      FC [5.5]. CAIS is also being\u000a      used within UK Sport's Inspire\/Aspire coach development programme, coaches\u000a      (including football\u000a      coaches) are supported with mentors in this programme and the mentors are\u000a      embedding CAIS\u000a      within their support programme. The CAIS is referred to within the Sports\u000a      Coach UK prospectus for\u000a      the Performance Coach Development Programme [5.9]\u000a    In summary, one of the fundamental indicators of significance in terms of\u000a      impact is the progression\u000a      and translation of these pieces of research into the policies and\u000a      practices of football's sport\u000a      governing body; the FA. Sport governing bodies are the service providers\u000a      and policy makers for\u000a      coaches and clubs with respect to coach and player education and\u000a      development. Through the FA\u000a      (its courses, website, social media outlets and management of national\u000a      teams) as well as direct\u000a      applications at club level, the various outputs from this research\u000a      programme have reached over\u000a      20,000 youth coaches (including international coaching members), from\u000a      1000's of clubs and teams\u000a      at all levels of the game. This is significant in integrating\u000a      sport psychology within the system of\u000a      youth development in football, and specifically through the behaviour and\u000a      applied practice of\u000a      coaches with youth football settings.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Football Association (FA) now incorporates player-centred evaluations\u000a      of international\u000a      tournaments into its policy as a result of longitudinal research at\u000a      Loughborough University aimed at\u000a      raising the profile and application of psychological principles in youth\u000a      football. In addition, FA\u000a      coaching award courses and coach development courses have integrated a\u000a      specific focus on core\u000a      psychological factors (known as the 5C's), and these have been promoted by\u000a      the FA to their\u000a      14,900 licensed coaches and 20,587 Twitter followers worldwide. These\u000a      principles have also been\u000a      adopted and embedded within English professional club academy programmes.\u000a      Further to this,\u000a      research conducted within coaching behaviour has resulted in the\u000a      development and marketing of\u000a      coach behaviour analysis software that has been sold to professional youth\u000a      academies and is\u000a      integral to coach development initiatives.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Loughborough University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Loughborough University","InstitutionName":"Loughborough University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10004113}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    All of these research studies have been published within leading\u000a      international peer reviewed\u000a      journals in the fields of sport psychology and sport science with impact\u000a      factors ranging from 1.2 to\u000a      2.7.\u000a    Theme 1:\u000a    \u000a3.1.

This research formed\u000a      key elements of\u000a      the FA's Psychology for Football programme and has been supported by over\u000a      &#163;500,000 of\u000a      research grant income to Loughborough University during this period. The\u000a      programme comprised\u000a      four main components. Firstly, research was initiated into identifying key\u000a      factors influencing the\u000a      performance by England National youth teams at international tournaments.\u000a      In the first study, Dr.\u000a      Chris Harwood (Reader in Applied Sport Psychology, 1998-current) and Dr.\u000a      Matt Pain (Research\u000a      Associate &amp; former PhD student, 2003-2012) developed the Performance\u000a      Environment Survey\u000a      (PES), a 66 item evaluation tool allowing coaches to assess the impact of\u000a      coaching, physical,\u000a      mental and social factors on team performance [3.1]. This tool was\u000a      used to investigate a wider\u000a      sample of England Youth teams, illustrating how important team, coaching\u000a      and social factors were\u000a      to players' perceptions of performance [3.2].\u000a    The second strand of research directly targeted the coach's role in the\u000a      psychological development\u000a      of the youth footballer. Harwood conducted an intervention study focused\u000a      on enhancing youth\u000a      coaches' levels of confidence in integrating mental skills and strategies\u000a      into their natural coaching\u000a      sessions [3.3]. His 5 C's programme over 15 weeks helped coaches\u000a      to teach players about\u000a      Commitment, Communication, Concentration, Control and Confidence within\u000a      their coaching\u000a      session time. Longitudinal results supported increases in coaches'\u000a      confidence about integrating the\u000a      5C's, and coaches reported simultaneous improvements in their young\u000a      players' demonstration of\u000a      5C psychological skills. This study was assisted by Nottingham Forest FC\u000a      who gave full access to\u000a      their coaching staff.\u000a    A third strand of applied research by Harwood and his research team\u000a      examined the phenomenon\u000a      of psychological momentum in football in order to help coaches and players\u000a      collaborate on the\u000a      mental skills and strategies required to maintain or regain control of a\u000a      game. In-depth interviews\u000a      with six student-athlete football players examined the situations and\u000a      strategies perceived to\u000a      positively and negatively influence momentum within teams and individuals\u000a      [3.4]. However,\u000a      assisted by contacts in the professional game and practical experience,\u000a      the information gained\u000a      from this study was then supplemented by further interviews with a range\u000a      of senior professional\u000a      players, managers and coaches. As a result of this additional work, and in\u000a      collaboration with\u000a      Alistair Higham (a coach educator with the FA), and Dr. Andy Cale (Head of\u000a      FA Player\u000a      Development), a textbook for coaches and players was published in 2005\u000a      entitled `Momentum in\u000a      Soccer: Controlling the Game'. This book represented a partnership with FA\u000a      Learning, the FA's\u000a      coach development arm, and Coachwise, the publisher for Sportscoach UK.\u000a    The fourth strand with Dr Chris Cushion (senior lecturer 2007- current)\u000a      building on his previous\u000a      published coach observation research in football has developed and\u000a      validated the Coach Analysis\u000a      Intervention System (CAIS) [3.5].

In addition, as a consequence of the\u000a      Loughborough Univerity\u000a      research, Professor Henry has regularly been invited to address NOC, IF,\u000a      and IOC staff on the\u000a      MEMOS [Master Ex&#233;cutif en Management des Organisations Sportives]\u000a      staff development\u000a      programme on measures to foster gender equity in governance and more\u000a      specifically he has acted\u000a      as advisor to studies by staff from NOCs in Poland, Israel and the Sudan\u000a      in relation to enhancing\u000a      electoral policies and practices in their national systems [5.7].\u000a    As regards issues in the governance of anti-doping, the period since 1999\u000a      has been one of\u000a      dramatic change in the global and domestic anti-doping regimes. The most\u000a      significant events at the\u000a      global level were the establishment of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)\u000a      and the ratification\u000a      of the UNESCO Convention Against Doping in Sport. WADA (and the National\u000a      Anti-Doping\u000a      Organisations) and UNESCO are the foundations of the global anti-doping\u000a      effort. The\u000a      Loughborough University research has had an impact on the way in which\u000a      education programmes\u000a      are planned by WADA and by the Japan Anti-Doping Agency [5.3, 5.4].\u000a      The research has also\u000a      impacted on the policy towards using legislation to underpin anti-doping\u000a      policy.\u000a    In terms of reach the research of Houlihan and Garcia has\u000a      provided WADA with evidence to\u000a      support its policy of encouraging governments to introduce legislation\u000a      specifically concerned with\u000a      controlling trafficking in performance enhancing drugs [5.3]. The\u000a      policy analysis instrument\u000a      (Improving and proving: A handbook for the evaluation of anti-doping\u000a      education programmes,\u000a      available at http:\/\/www.wada-ama.org\/Global\/Houlihan_Final_Report.pdf\u000a      ) developed by Houlihan\u000a      has been promoted by WADA as a model for the planning and evaluation of\u000a      anti-doping education\u000a      programmes.

The adoption or\u000a      endorsement by either\u000a      of these two organisations of research is significant insofar as they,\u000a      especially WADA, are the\u000a      reference points for all National Anti-Doping Organisations and all\u000a      international sports\u000a      organisations when devising their own anti-doping policies and activities.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research, conducted at Loughborough University between 1998 and 2013,\u000a      into two central\u000a      issues in sport governance, gender equity and doping, has changed the\u000a      policies and procedures of\u000a      two international sports organisations and their domestic affiliates.

The research reported in this case study\u000a      centres on\u000a      representation, decision-making, and compliance and accountability. The\u000a      research in relation to\u000a      the impact on governance and gender equity was concentrated in two studies\u000a      from 2002-4 and\u000a      2008-10 by teams of staff all based at Loughborough University throughout\u000a      the research, led by\u000a      Professor Ian Henry (1989-present) as Principal Investigator, and funded\u000a      by the IOC.

The research output from this first study [3.1,\u000a        3.4] identified the\u000a      extent of gender inequity in selected national and international sport\u000a      organisations and provided a\u000a      theoretical analysis of the institutional barriers to gender equity and\u000a      the impact of those barriers on\u000a      women within the organisations. The research, which was reported to, and\u000a      adopted by, the IOC's\u000a      World Conference on Women and Sport in Marrakesh in 2004, informed the\u000a      theoretical and\u000a      methodological framework for the second study.\u000a    Henry also led the second study (Professor Leigh Robinson (2000-2010) was\u000a      co-investigator). This\u000a      research [3.3] (drawing on some pilot studies of national\u000a      federations e.g. [3.2]), evaluated the\u000a      difficulties experienced by women in gaining election to local agencies of\u000a      the IOC, and identified\u000a      electoral strategies for the successful election of women in different\u000a      socio-political contexts across\u000a      the five continents and in world bodies. The 2008-10 IOC research\u000a      identified the range of structural\u000a      and cultural factors which explained the pattern of election of women to\u000a      executive positions in\u000a      National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and International Sports Federations\u000a      (IFs). It specified the\u000a      difficulties of establishing a unified set of governance principles in\u000a      highly varied cultural and\u000a      political environments, and analysed electoral strategies which have been\u000a      adopted in different\u000a      contexts to achieve more equitable outcomes. It proposed a set of actions\u000a      which would assist in\u000a      addressing the problems of women's underrepresentation in decision-making\u000a      bodies across\u000a      cultures which were reported to the IOC Women and Sport Commission in 2011\u000a      and to the IOC\u000a      World Conference on Women and Sport in 2012 [3.3].\u000a    Research by Professor Barrie Houlihan (1998-present) into the governance\u000a      of anti-doping policy\u000a      undertaken at Loughborough dates from the early 2000s and has been funded\u000a      by the European\u000a      Commission (2001, with PMP Consulting), the British Medical Association\u000a      (2001-2), the Council of\u000a      Europe (2002; 2003), UK Sport (2004), UNESCO (2009) and the World\u000a      Anti-Doping Agency (2011,\u000a      2012).

Dr Borja Garcia\u000a      (2008-present) was a co-investigator.\u000a    The initial phase of research had a similar focus to that on gender\u000a      equity insofar as it assessed\u000a      issues of stakeholder representation, compliance and accountability within\u000a      and between domestic\u000a      and international organisations. The main finding was to challenge the\u000a      emphasis on deterrence\u000a      and detection at the expense of education [3.5]. The later phase\u000a      of research examined and\u000a      developed methodologies for evaluating the impact of anti-doping activity\u000a      [3.6]. The research\u000a      provided insights into, inter alia: the problematic nature of\u000a      providing a `voice' for athletes in the\u000a      policy process; the weaknesses in existing anti-doping strategies and\u000a      strategy evaluation. In\u000a      particular the research emphasised the need for more effective monitoring\u000a      of compliance and the\u000a      development of techniques for ensuring better policy design in relation to\u000a      anti-doping education.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42115","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Warm-up exercise has an important role to play in optimising performance\u000d\u000a      during subsequent exercise. Prior to this body of research,\u000d\u000a      pre-competition activity was undertaken, in part, to warm the muscles\u000d\u000a      prior to the event. Research conducted at Aberystwyth University showed\u000d\u000a      clearly that rather than an increase in muscle temperature, it is a change\u000d\u000a      in muscle activation that leads to the ergogenic effect observed. This\u000d\u000a      research provided key evidence in the development of \"priming\" exercise\u000d\u000a      regimes for use prior to athletic competition.\u000d\u000a    Within this impact case study we are claiming two forms of impact. First,\u000d\u000a      the impact upon the professional practice of sports scientists, coaches,\u000d\u000a      and elite athletes who now employ priming exercise regimes (in the place\u000d\u000a      of other \"warm-up\" exercise) with prior to competition. Specifically, the\u000d\u000a      examples below show impacts upon the English Institute of Sport (EIS),\u000d\u000a      Team Sky professional cycling team, a professional UK based cyclist. It is\u000d\u000a      likely that others will have been impacted, and those discussed are not a\u000d\u000a      conclusive list. Secondary impact is claimed from the dissemination of\u000d\u000a      this work to amateur athletes and the wider exerciser community. This was\u000d\u000a      an impact upon society, and in particular, informing their behaviours.\u000d\u000a    Impact upon sports science practitioners and elite athletes\u000d\u000a    The key difficulty in \"proving\" impact within elite sport where the\u000d\u000a      differences in performance are miniscule, and the reward for success is\u000d\u000a      huge, is that the precise practice of practitioners and elite athletes are\u000d\u000a      closely guarded secrets. Whilst investigating the impact of this research\u000d\u000a      it became evident that there was a disconnect between the \"research\" and\u000d\u000a      its \"application\" within sport. It was clear from the research that there\u000d\u000a      was a significant benefit of priming exercise within the laboratory, but\u000d\u000a      these benefits were potentially not realised by sports scientists and\u000d\u000a      their athletes.\u000d\u000a    Example 1 - English Institute of Sport (source 1)\u000d\u000a    The head of physiology at the English Institute Sport (EIS) was clearly\u000d\u000a      influenced by the work on priming exercise of Dr Mark Burnley and\u000d\u000a      investigated the warm-up practices performed by elite UK athletes and\u000d\u000a      found that similar protocols were performed by sprinters all the way\u000d\u000a      through to marathon runners. He questioned this approach and presented an\u000d\u000a      alternative - priming exercise. This was met with resistance by coaches\u000d\u000a      and athletes alike - maybe unfairly, they suggested that \"your evidence is\u000d\u000a      circumspect so this is off limits\" and \"we don't want to spend all of our\u000d\u000a      pennies in the warm-up for fear that they would suffer in the main\u000d\u000a      performance\".\u000d\u000a    During a relaxed phase between competitions, Dr Ingham and colleagues\u000d\u000a      (with the backing of UK Sport) conducted applied work using an adapted\u000d\u000a      \"high-intensity\" priming protocol, based on our research, and found a 1 s\u000d\u000a      (0.8%; or 6 m) improvement in running performance in a group of elite 800m\u000d\u000a      runners. The majority of this performance improvement came in the final\u000d\u000a      400m, where the pace slowed less than the control.\u000d\u000a    This new priming protocol was on first glance similar to what athletes\u000d\u000a      previously performed, but contained a \"competition specific protocol\"\u000d\u000a      which elicited a marked improvement in performance. This testing using\u000d\u000a      elite athletes and a competition specific strategy brought the\u000d\u000a      breakthrough in application, which was fuelled from the research. This has\u000d\u000a      now been infused into the systems at EIS and their long-term strategy. EIS\u000d\u000a      network fed this practice to other physiologists and to other \"engine room\u000d\u000a      sports\" such as swimming, cycling and rowing and was used at the Beijing\u000d\u000a      Olympics and other major championships since.\u000d\u000a    Example 2 - Professional cycling (sources 2 and 3)\u000d\u000a    Our second example covers the use of priming exercise within professional\u000d\u000a      cycling. An interview broadcast live on ITV4 with a UK based professional\u000d\u000a      cyclist (riding for the metaltek_KOO professional cycling team). The\u000d\u000a      protocol performed prior to competition was based upon knowledge learned\u000d\u000a      from research performed at Aberystwyth University, and mentions that his\u000d\u000a      goal is to \"prime the muscles for the race\".

The specific\u000d\u000a      details of their practice are shown in a screenshot taken from the clip\u000d\u000a      (source 3.2). This shows a \"progressive\" 8 min warm up\", a number of short\u000d\u000a      accelerations to \"activate\" [the muscle fibres], and the instruction to\u000d\u000a      finish the protocol \"10 minutes before the start of competition\". It is\u000d\u000a      very clear that their practice is based upon the priming exercise\u000d\u000a      literature. They also state the usefulness of this practice across a range\u000d\u000a      of event distances, and that its use is also applicable to amateur\u000d\u000a      athletes.\u000d\u000a    Wider dissemination \/ impact upon amateur athletes and regular\u000d\u000a          exercisers\u000d\u000a    This body of research was selected for an independent Research Councils\u000d\u000a      UK (RCUK) report that detailed the impact of academic research on sport\u000d\u000a      and exercise practice published prior to the 2012 London Olympic games.\u000d\u000a      This research was not funded by RCUK, and so being cited in this report\u000d\u000a      shows clearly the significance of this research and the importance of the\u000d\u000a      timing of publication prior to the London Olympic games.\u000d\u000a    Once we move away from elite sport it is far easier to \"prove\" the impact\u000d\u000a      of the priming exercise research conducted at Aberystwyth University.

This research\u000d\u000a      established that \"high-intensity\" priming exercise (that significantly\u000d\u000a      increases blood lactate concentration) increases the primary amplitude of\u000d\u000a      the oxygen uptake response in the muscle consequent not to a \"warm-up\"\u000d\u000a      effect per se, but rather to an increase in muscle activity\u000d\u000a      (Burnley et al., 2002). This increase in muscle activation enhances the\u000d\u000a      muscles ability to utilize oxygen, leading to an increase in exercise\u000d\u000a      performance (Jones et al., 2003; Burnley et al., 2005). Jones et al.\u000d\u000a      (2003) demonstrated that prior heavy exercise resulted in an elevated\u000d\u000a      blood lactate concentration and enhanced subsequent performance (measured\u000d\u000a      as time to exhaustion during cycle ergometry) by 30-60%. Burnley et al.\u000d\u000a      (2005) performed a more comprehensive investigation and showed that both\u000d\u000a      prior moderate and prior heavy exercise increased mean power output during\u000d\u000a      a cycle performance trial by 2-3%. The findings of this research fly in\u000d\u000a      the face of traditional thinking &#8212; that the muscle must be \"warm\" to\u000d\u000a      perform optimally, and that an increase in blood lactate concentration has\u000d\u000a      a negative effect on subsequent exercise. This research clearly shows that\u000d\u000a      elevating blood lactate concentration (to~4mM) with a short (~6 min) bout\u000d\u000a      \"priming exercise\" (performed ~20-45 min prior to exercise), can\u000d\u000a      dramatically enhance exercise performance.\u000d\u000a    This research has impacted upon athletes and practitioners as it has\u000d\u000a      provided key evidence that overturns previous beliefs about \"warm-up\", and\u000d\u000a      it provides an alternative \"priming protocol\" that that can clearly\u000d\u000a      enhance exercise performance. This effect is likely most effective during\u000d\u000a      \"shorter\" (~2-15 min) bouts of exercise performed within the laboratory,\u000d\u000a      but would likely be of benefit during competitive events of up to a few\u000d\u000a      hours in duration.\u000d\u000a    Outline of underpinning research: what was undertaken, when, by whom:\u000d\u000a    The research underpinning this case study was conducted by the Human\u000d\u000a      Performance research group at Aberystwyth University, led by Dr Mark\u000d\u000a      Burnley (2002-2012; now University of Kent) and with colleagues at\u000d\u000a      Aberystwyth University; Prof. Jonathan Doust (2002-2006; now University of\u000d\u000a      Brighton), Dr Jonathan Baker (2007-present), Dr Glen Davison (2006-2011;\u000d\u000a      now University of Kent), and in collaboration and with Prof. Andrew Jones\u000d\u000a      (University of Exeter).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42116","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research conducted by Aberystwyth University's Physical Activity in\u000d\u000a      Ageing, Rehabilitation and Health Research Group has influenced provision\u000d\u000a      of, access to, and protocols for, community exercise schemes,\u000d\u000a      particularly, but not exclusively, in the rural context. Before 2005,\u000d\u000a      there were no community exercise schemes in operation in the rural region\u000d\u000a      of West Wales. The role of Aberystwyth University researchers in securing\u000d\u000a      the research funding to develop and implement CESs influenced directly the\u000d\u000a      change in provision of such services.

The continued provision of service is\u000d\u000a      now funded through the National Exercise Referral Scheme. In addition, our\u000d\u000a      evidence-based recommendation that the delivery of the scheme be\u000d\u000a      integrated into the local leisure centre is consistent with the scheme\u000d\u000a      being re-located entirely to the leisure centre in 2009.(1)\u000d\u000a    Our initial work provided a framework for subsequent services.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, Doust was the academic, expert consultant for the Welsh\u000d\u000a      Government's (GW) (2006) published guidance on setting up, running and\u000d\u000a      evaluating exercise referral schemes and the specification of core\u000d\u000a      training competencies that underpin the National Occupational Standards\u000d\u000a      (NOS).(2) In 2008 the WG funded the appointment of a National Coordinator\u000d\u000a      to commission approved training which met the new NOS for chronic\u000d\u000a      conditions and develop standard protocols. These protocols have been\u000d\u000a      implemented across Wales where there are rehabilitation programmes\u000d\u000a      delivered by exercise professionals with the necessary qualifications.(2)\u000d\u000a    Cardiac rehabilitation scheme:\u000d\u000a    Before 2005, the only cardiac rehabilitation schemes (CRSs) in operation\u000d\u000a      in the rural region of West Wales, was a centralised, hospital-based\u000d\u000a      programme. As part of the Aberystwyth research programme led by Doust,\u000d\u000a      four community-based CRSs were developed and implemented in the region,\u000d\u000a      three of which are still in operation, i.e. Aberystwyth, Cardigan and\u000d\u000a      Lampeter.(4)\u000d\u000a    The availability of a community-based CRS significantly impacted patient\u000d\u000a      engagement with the treatment regimen, such that there has been a 75%\u000d\u000a      increase in the proportion of referred patients who complete the exercise\u000d\u000a      programme, rising from 40% to 70% for the hospital-based and\u000d\u000a      community-based programmes, respectively.(5)\u000d\u000a    Increased engagement and the enhanced treatment regimen have, either\u000d\u000a      alone or together, led directly to improved health of individuals and\u000d\u000a      cost-savings for the health authority. More specifically, Ceredigion\u000d\u000a      Cardiac Rehabilitation Service estimates that the community-based scheme\u000d\u000a      prevents avoidable admissions to secondary care for at least 150 patients\u000d\u000a      pa, with a cost-saving, based on average days in hospital, of &#163;242,316.75\u000d\u000a      pa.(4-5)\u000d\u000a    As noted by the Locality Service Co-ordinator, `we have gained a service\u000d\u000a      which has been properly researched using validated physical and\u000d\u000a      psychological tools, ... providing opportunity to improve our standards\u000d\u000a      and develop protocols'(6, p39), and which `... prevent avoidable\u000d\u000a      admissions to secondary care'.(6, p42).\u000d\u000a    Falls prevention scheme:\u000d\u000a    The findings of our research have had a direct impact on regional\u000d\u000a      planning and delivery of community exercise schemes for falls prevention,\u000d\u000a      such that one scheme continues to operate at an optimal level,(7) whilst\u000d\u000a      another entirely new scheme has been launched(8).

Other key members of the research group include Dr Emily Oliver\u000d\u000a      (2009 to date), Dr Rachel Rahman (2008 to date), and Dr David Tod (2004 to\u000d\u000a      date).\u000d\u000a    In November 2003 Doust received a collaborative award (New Opportunities\u000d\u000a      Fund: &#163;289, 572) to design, implement and evaluate a GP Exercise Referral\u000d\u000a      Scheme (ERS) (the Ceredigion Exercise For Life Scheme) for people\u000d\u000a      identified by the GP as `someone who would benefit from a more active\u000d\u000a      lifestyle' and, alongside this, an enhanced scheme for people with, or at\u000d\u000a      risk of, heart disease (the Ceredigion Cardiac Rehabilitation Scheme &#8212;\u000d\u000a      CRS). The award was in partnership with Ceredigion Council and Ceredigion\u000d\u000a      NHS Trust, and was secured through a competitive, peer-review procedure.\u000d\u000a    The research (1-3) used a mixed methods approach to determine the\u000d\u000a      feasibility and estimate the effectiveness of the exercise schemes, the\u000d\u000a      acceptability of the schemes and their implementation, and both rates and\u000d\u000a      predictors of continued exercise at 6 months. In addition, focus groups\u000d\u000a      were conducted to further understand the results, inform decision-making\u000d\u000a      and refine treatment protocols. The key findings underpinning impact were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The high number of eligible patients who were referred (&gt;250\u000d\u000a        patients pa to each scheme) demonstrated that there was demand for\u000d\u000a        community exercise services.\u000d\u000a      Uptake was good for both ERS and CRS (&gt;70% of referred patients\u000d\u000a        attending), and a high proportion who started also completed the course\u000d\u000a        &#8212; 89% and 69% for ERS and CRS, respectively.\u000d\u000a      Effectiveness of the schemes was demonstrated through improvements in\u000d\u000a        a range of physiological markers of health (e.g. decreased skin fold),\u000d\u000a        as well as a range of psychological outcomes, such as reduced anxiety.\u000d\u000a      At 6-months follow-up, 50% of patients self-reported that they were\u000d\u000a        exercising at the required level, whilst 15% reported that they were no\u000d\u000a        longer exercising at the required level.\u000d\u000a      Access to leisure services during the exercise programme was liked by\u000d\u000a        patients and predicted longer term maintenance of exercise, whilst\u000d\u000a        patients also favoured the option of outdoor physical activity, as\u000d\u000a        opposed to only indoor structured exercise.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In 2005 Doust secured two competitive, peer-reviewed funding awards from\u000d\u000a      the Countryside Council for Wales in order to develop the evaluation\u000d\u000a      framework (&#163;14,000) for the Walking the Way to Health initiative in Wales\u000d\u000a      and, subsequently, to implement the evaluation framework (&#163;35,000).\u000d\u000a    The key findings (4-5) of the research were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      country-side walking to improve health was acceptable to, and safe\u000d\u000a        for, both the general public and sub-clinical populations.\u000d\u000a      non-healthcare professionals could be trained in a core set of\u000d\u000a        competencies required to set-up and deliver the walking scheme in\u000d\u000a        accordance with the programme protocol.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In 2009 Hudson and Oliver were commissioned (BCUHB: &#163;32,000) to estimate\u000d\u000a      the effects of a regional community exercise scheme for falls prevention\u000d\u000a      and, importantly, to make recommendations for future practice. A\u000d\u000a      significant factor in attracting a commission is the recognition of not\u000d\u000a      only specialist expertise but also research excellence. The work was\u000d\u000a      expanded to additionally receive an EU-funded Knowledge Economy Skills\u000d\u000a      Scholarship. Quantitative data were collected at the start and end of the\u000d\u000a      32-week exercise programme, with qualitative data collected at weeks 10,\u000d\u000a      20 and 30. The key findings (6) underpinning impact were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Significant improvements in objective measures of physical function\u000d\u000a        that continued throughout the 32 week period, including measures of\u000d\u000a        balance, gait, and co-ordinated movement.\u000d\u000a      Psychological variables, such as attitude towards exercise, improved\u000d\u000a        more in the early stages of the programme, but that these changes were\u000d\u000a        maintained.\u000d\u000a      The integration of programme provision with leisure services was a\u000d\u000a        strong patient preference and, when classes were held in the leisure\u000d\u000a        centre, attendance was higher than when classes were held in the\u000d\u000a        community health centre.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42393","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The claimed impacts have exclusively been led by or delivered at\u000a      Loughborough University between 2011 and 2013. There have been four\u000a      primary impacts. (1) a novel assessment tool (CET; 3.3) (2) the\u000a      LEAP treatment manual, available to download from http:\/\/www.lboro.ac.uk\/research\/nceds\/resources\/\u000a      (3) Patient benefit (n = 520 patients treated to date); (4). Training\u000a      workshops and consultancy for clinicians and exercise professionals (n =\u000a      circa 600 delegates to date).\u000a    The significance of both the CET and LEAP can be verified by our audit\u000a      report which suggests that these innovations have changed the way in which\u000a      clinicians across the globe assess and manage compulsive exercise within\u000a      their services.\u000a    (1)The CET [3.3] is being used as a screening tool for eating\u000a      disorder (ED) pathology, specifically for the compulsive\u000a      exercise that often pre-dates eating concerns. In fact, the National\u000a      Eating Disorders Collaboration (NEDC, Australia, http:\/\/www.nedc.com.au\/identifying-people-at-risk)\u000a      and Harvard University - affiliated ED service both recommend the CET as a\u000a      key screening measure [5.1, 5.2, 5.5]. The CET is published within\u000a      a book, written by two Harvard University Academics. The use of the CET\u000a      has a preventative impact of considerable significance by providing\u000a      assessment of this early ED symptom and thereby providing a target for\u000a      early intervention and reducing the overall number of ED cases.\u000a    (2) LEAP is an empirically-based [3.2, 3.4] cognitive-behavioural\u000a      intervention [3.5] delivered via either group or\u000a      individual settings and for use with in-patients and out-patients. Pilot\u000a      data (from 30 hospitalised patients), demonstrates the significance of the\u000a      LEAP impact in reducing length of hospitalisation (from 41 days in the\u000a      control group to 31 days in the LEAP group), improving quality of life and\u000a      reducing levels of anxiety among patients. In addition, there were\u000a      significant reductions in psychopathology, and increases in weight,\u000a      sustained at 12 month follow-up in comparison to `treatment as usual'\u000a      (data presented as Meyer et al., at the London International\u000a        Conference on Eating Disorders, 2009; 2010). Clinicians have\u000a      welcomed this development [5.1-5.5] with LEAP being presented at\u000a      over 25 clinical services and at NHS R&amp;D events. Director of the\u000a      Sydney Eating Disorders Service in Australia and the Associate Director\u000a      from Harvard University's affiliated eating disorder clinic both\u000a      acknowledge that this treatment will radically change the way in which\u000a      clinicians treat their patients [5.1, 5.2]. LEAP is currently\u000a      subject to an international, multi-centre randomised controlled trial,\u000a      funded by the Australian National Health Medical Research Council.\u000a    (3) In relation to direct patient benefit, the LEAP manual has only been\u000a      available for download since September 2011, and has been downloaded by 56\u000a      specialist eating disorder services in: the UK, USA, Australia, New\u000a      Zealand, Germany, Norway and Italy. The reach of the manual's impact can\u000a      be seen by the number of patients who have already received the LEAP\u000a      programme. Our recently conducted audit provides a conservative\u000a      approximation of 520 patients worldwide, external to Loughborough\u000a      University, who have benefitted as a direct result of the research\u000a      outlined in section three. Feedback reports that 80% of the services\u000a      endorsed LEAP as either \"useful\" or \"very useful\" at reducing patient's\u000a      compulsive exercise. In addition to the worldwide reach of LEAP, more\u000a      locally, a further 40 patients have benefitted from the LEAP work,\u000a      delivered at Loughborough University's (LU) partner services; Leicester\u000a      NHS Adult Eating Disorder (ED) service, and the Birmingham &amp; Solihull\u000a      Mental Health Foundation Trust ED inpatient service [5.3]. The\u000a      impact of LEAP is significant; with over 80% of the recipients reporting\u000a      that the treatment was either \"helpful\" or \"very helpful\" at helping them\u000a      to manage their unhealthy exercise in a healthier way, with all patients\u000a      endorsing that LEAP increased their awareness of the nature and function\u000a      of their compulsive exercise.\u000a    (4) The reach of LEAP is not constrained to directly benefitting eating\u000a      disorder clients. In addition, the underpinning research has led to\u000a      training workshops delivered to clinicians, who are now delivering LEAP to\u000a      their patients, as well as disseminating their acquired knowledge to\u000a      colleagues within their services [5.1-5.5]. 85% of clinicians, who\u000a      received LU's training, endorsed it as either \"useful\" or \"very useful\" at\u000a      increasing their ability to understand and appropriately manage\u000a      problematic exercise in their service.\u000a    In addition to the CET and LEAP impacts, the underpinning research has\u000a      led to the development of education and training programmes for athletes\u000a      and coaches (delivered to Athletes, Clinicians, Medics, Physiotherapists,\u000a      Sport Nutritionalists, Performance coaches, Teachers etc from\u000a      organisations including the English Institute of Sport, UK Athletics,\u000a      British Gymnastics, The Royal Ballet, British Triathlon etc). As a result,\u000a      LU now delivers consultancy, previously unavailable in the UK, to key\u000a      stakeholders.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Compulsive Exercise Test (CET) and Loughborough Eating disorders\u000a      Activity Programme (LEAP) are the world's first clinical assessment tool\u000a      and intervention designed to assess and treat compulsive exercise among\u000a      eating disorder patients.

They are\u000a      currently in use by in excess of 52 specialist eating disorder services\u000a      globally, including the vast majority of specialist services in the UK (a\u000a      minimum of 520 patients treated to date).

Specifically, since 2005, Professors Meyer\u000a      (Loughborough University employee 2005 to date) and Jon Arcelus (Visiting\u000a      Fellow at Loughborough University 2009 to date) and Drs Emma Haycraft\u000a      (Loughborough University employee 2007 to date), Lorin Taranis (Research\u000a      Student 2005-2009) and Huw Goodwin (Research Student and Post-Doctoral\u000a      fellow 2006-2012) have been researching those factors that cause and\u000a      maintain the devastating symptom of compulsive exercise (CE). Numerous\u000a      studies from world-leading groups demonstrate that exercise is often one\u000a      of the first symptoms to develop, the last to subside and is associated\u000a      with longer hospital stays, greater pathology, poor treatment outcome and\u000a      higher relapse rates. Until this research was carried out (exclusively at\u000a      Loughborough University) very little attempt had been made to understand\u000a      compulsive exercise.\u000a    Our initial CE research (partly funded by the Medical Research Council\u000a      inter-disciplinary Bridging Award) supervised by Prof. Meyer and Prof.\u000a      Arcelus highlighted to clinicians the multi-dimensional nature of CE,\u000a      which had previously been treated as a unitary construct [3.2]. In\u000a      addition, this work led to the development of a valid, reliable\u000a      measurement tool; the Compulsive Exercise Test, which has been subject to\u000a      factor analysis and psychometric evaluation in four separate studies to\u000a      date [e.g., 3.3]. This aetiological work, conducted between 2008\u000a      and 2010, also involved a longitudinal study of the development of CE\u000a      among a large group of adolescents (n = circa 1500). Three PhDs and\u000a      subsequent Research Associates; Dr Huw Goodwin, Dr Lorin Taranis; Carolyn\u000a      Plateau (current Research Student and Assistant) have contributed to this\u000a      portfolio of work. Our CE articles have already received 91 citations,\u000a      since being published in 2008.\u000a    The first tranche of cross-sectional research findings enabled us to\u000a      publish a novel conceptual model of CE[3.4]. The model\u000a      implicates some key maintaining factors for which, in addition to specific\u000a      social and environmental risk factors, were replicated by a longitudinal\u000a      study. The research underpinning the development of the LEAP manual led to\u000a      an invited special edition editorship by Prof. Meyer of the European\u000a        Eating Disorders Review, published in 2011.\u000a    Our resulting LEAP manual has been the subject of 8 training workshops in\u000a      the UK, Australia and the USA. This clinician training has been informed\u000a      by our fundamental research into the treatment process [e.g., 3.5],\u000a      and has included 4 invited workshops at international conferences (with\u000a      circa 600 delegates to date).\u000a    Since 2008, this research has been supported by grants from competitive\u000a      peer-reviewed sources, including an MRC Interdisciplinary Bridging Award,\u000a      funding from the Health Innovation Education Council (HIEC); National\u000a      Health Service Comprehensive Local Research Network funding and funding\u000a      from the Australian National Health Medical Research Council for an\u000a      international randomised controlled trial. This research has already\u000a      resulted in 13 peer-reviewed journal articles (2011 to date), all of which\u000a      are published in international journals.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42396","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The evidence of the research impact is wide and significant. It has been\u000a      evidenced by a) advancing assistive technologies in a sporting\u000a      environment; b) having peer-reviewed knowledge; c) being of an applied\u000a      nature with out-reach to athletes, coaches and wheelchair manufacturers\u000a      and d) has instigated collaborative networks with several key\u000a      internationally renowned researchers. The PHC's research (2008-13) has\u000a      delivered on a number of performance related projects which have impacted\u000a      on UK Sports funded Paralympic Sports and contributed to ParalympicGB's\u000a      achievements at the London 2012 Paralympics [5.1, 5.2].\u000a    Supporting Paralympic Performance: The outputs from the PHC's\u000a      wheelchair configuration research theme has significantly influenced the\u000a      preparation strategies of the Paralympic athletes leading into the 2012\u000a      London Paralympic Games, by better educating them about wheelchair\u000a      configuration and chair choice (all members of the wheelchair rugby and\u000a      basketball teams, n=36). The research findings have been presented by Dr's\u000a      Goosey-Tolfrey and Mason to ParalympicsGB practitioners and both GB\u000a      athletes\/coaches. The LU based research found that changes in wheelchair\u000a      camber greatly influenced wheelchair mobility performance. With Dr's\u000a      Goosey-Tolfrey and Mason's assistance they worked closely with UK Sport's\u000a      Research and Innovation team on individual case studies to optimise\u000a      straight line speed and agility within the sport of wheelchair rugby.\u000a      Working with the rugby athletes on an individual basis provided them with\u000a      the evidence-base to help inform their choice when purchasing sports\u000a      wheelchairs for London 2012. Consequently, two of the twelve players\u000a      reduced their chair camber following this work [5.3]. Furthermore,\u000a      one of the central projects in LU's partnership with UK Sport was\u000a      identified from the earlier work of Dr Barry Mason's PhD, where the need\u000a      to individualise the wheelchair-user-interface was identified. This led to\u000a      a joint partnership between UK Sport, BMW and LU (including the Sports\u000a      Technology Institute (2011-12)) where a systematic ergonomic approach was\u000a      adopted to improve the design of wheelchair seating. This team developed\u000a      individualised seating for 8 players (4 men and 4 women) competing in the\u000a      Paralympic Games in London 2012 [5.4]. At the other end of the\u000a      sporting spectrum, the key insights from this work have advised athletes,\u000a      particularly those who are new to wheelchair sport or inexperienced, to\u000a      configure their sports wheelchairs to 18&#176; camber and 26\" wheels.\u000a    The LU based research has facilitated the development of on-court\u000a      wheelchair sport specific procedures, a pool of normative physiological\u000a      data and training guidelines that can and have been used by sport science\u000a      practitioners within the Home Institutes (English Institute of Sport\u000a      (EIS)) and National Governing Bodies. Moreover, a presentation has been\u000a      made by Dr's Leicht and Goosey-Tolfrey to the UK Sport talent team\u000a      entitled `The physiological determinants of performance in upper body\u000a      exercise in athletes with a disability' to inform the talent scientists of\u000a      the disability pathways. Similarly, the PHC's work has been cited within\u000a      the guidelines for preparing the Paralympic athlete and practitioner for\u000a      the 2012 London Paralympic Games that was circulated to all GB staff and\u000a      athletes at the Games (~600). With Dr Goosey-Tolfrey's assistance novel\u000a      training strategies have been identified for those practitioners working\u000a      in disability sport enabling them `To deliver the best prepared\u000a      Paralympics team to the Paralympic Games' (achieving the strategic\u000a      objective of the British Paralympic Association) [5.1, 5.5].\u000a    The PHC's research agenda has helped inform the talent identification for\u000a      British Disability Cycling\/ British Para-triathlon, identifying credible\u000a      performance for Goalball and assisted the applied research that has been\u000a      provided to the British Wheelchair Basketball Association and Great\u000a      Britain Wheelchair Rugby. LU's research has helped with the development of\u000a      heart rate (HR) guidelines for GB wheelchair athletes during training and\u000a      with the quantification of exercise intensity through the use of rating of\u000a      perceived exertion (RPE) methods. For example, individualised HR training\u000a      methods have been established by testing at LU, and consequently been used\u000a      by several of the GB wheelchair basketball players whilst they were\u000a      overseas in Europe to support their training (2011) [5.6].\u000a    Education and Knowledge Transfer: The PHC is recognised as a\u000a      leading Paralympic research centre and proof of this positioning was the\u000a      invitation to lead and organise the 2013 UK High Performance Conference\u000a      for Paralympic Sports Science and Sports Medicine (with the British\u000a      Paralympic Association and EIS) funded by the PHF. Moreover, at the other\u000a      end of the exercise continuum, the key studies cited earlier [3.1, 3.2\u000a        &amp; 3.3] underpin sections of a 20 page booklet (which was\u000a      developed with Bromakin and RGK wheelchair manufacturers and\u000a      ParalympicsGB). This information is essential as it guides rehabilitation\u000a      specialists and those involved with development athletes through the\u000a      journey of wheelchair sports chair selection from beginner to elite\u000a      performer [5.7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This well established research conducted by members of Peter Harrison\u000a      Centre for Disability Sport (Loughborough University) is seen as an\u000a      integral part of the support provided for Paralympic wheelchair athletes\u000a      and has impact in 3 key areas:\u000a    \u000a      To help identify the fundamental characteristics of elite wheelchair\u000a        athletes and assist with athlete profiling by supporting the Paralympic\u000a        `performance pathways' to refine their talent identification and\u000a        confirmation procedures\u000a      With the refinement of the testing and monitoring procedures used to\u000a        assess the physiological and biomechanical demands of wheelchair sport\u000a        performance\u000a      Supporting the education of high-performance coaches by enabling them\u000a        to gain a better understanding of the technical variables that affect\u000a        wheelchair mobility performance\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Loughborough University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Loughborough University","InstitutionName":"Loughborough University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10004113}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Dr Goosey-Tolfrey's recognition and impact in the field has been\u000a      facilitated by her publications in high-quality peer-reviewed journals\u000a      such as Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise which is ranked\u000a      3\/84 of the Sports Sciences journals.

This was cemented and advanced via an initial &#163;746,000\u000a      grant by the Peter Harrison Foundation (PHF) for the establishment of the\u000a      Peter Harrison Centre for Disability Sport (PHC) (2004-10). The\u000a      underpinning research that is relevant to generating impact began in 2008\u000a      and was led by Dr Vicky Goosey-Tolfrey who was appointed as Senior\u000a      Lecturer &amp; Director of the PHC in 2007 at LU, and was promoted in 2011\u000a      to Reader in Applied Disability Sport. It also involved three PhD\u000a      students, one of which was funded by UK Sport in partnership with\u000a      ParalympicsGB all who now hold post-doctoral positions (Dr's Barry Mason,\u000a      Christof Leicht and John Lenton; 2011-present).\u000a    The research also grew out of an International collaboration with Prof.\u000a      Lucas van der Woude (Chair in Human Movement, Rehabilitation and\u000a      Functional Recovery at the University Medical Center Groningen). The work\u000a      enabled the PHC to bridge the divide between rehabilitation sciences and a\u000a      high performance sporting environment where LU's expertise lies by sharing\u000a      knowledge across the exercise continuum. Due to the complexity of\u000a      wheelchair propulsion it is unclear how the daily-ambulation research\u000a      translates to a sporting context. The experimental studies have confirmed\u000a      that during sub-maximal wheelchair propulsion the use of larger camber\u000a      settings (20&#176; and 24&#176;) increased the power output (PO)\u000a      requirements of the wheelchair sportsperson [3.1]. During\u000a      sub-maximal propulsion PO increments are unfavorable due to the\u000a      associated increases in physiological demand. Given the fact that smaller\u000a      wheels (24\") also increase the physiological demands the group were able\u000a      to conclude that the selection of both these configurations should be\u000a      avoided in the same wheelchair to prevent these elements becoming\u000a      exacerbated and thus performance hampered [3.2]. The use of an\u000a      instrumented hand-rim (SMARTWheel) was a novel and innovative\u000a      approach into the ergonomics of wheelchair configuration. It has never\u000a      been adopted before in sports wheelchairs with the relevant sports\u000a      specific range of configurations. Yet, it enabled a more detailed\u000a      investigation into the ergonomics of sports wheelchair performance evoked\u000a      by changes in wheel size [3.3].\u000a    The laboratory based investigations that are conducted in the PHC's\u000a      state-of-the-art facilities use a specialised treadmill which enable the\u000a      researchers to investigate the biomechanical and physiological responses\u000a      of sports wheelchair propulsion. Using this ecologically valid approach,\u000a      ensuring that the wheelchair athlete is tested in their own sports\u000a      wheelchair the group have extended their research strategy to challenge\u000a      the use of able-bodied exercise\/training paradigms and their application\u000a      to the wheelchair athlete. Research at LU has established that the ratings\u000a      of perceived exertion (RPE) can be utilised for the regulation of\u000a      hand-cycling exercise for trained paraplegics [3.4].

Yeadon (1990-present) at\u000d\u000a      Loughborough University between 1993 when he was Senior Lecturer and 2013\u000d\u000a      when he was Professor of Computer Simulation in Sport. This comprehensive\u000d\u000a      and unique research into twisting somersaults was based upon\u000d\u000a      three-dimensional image analysis of performances together with theoretical\u000d\u000a      computer simulations, giving key insights into the mechanics of aerial\u000d\u000a      movement and implications for coaching.\u000d\u000a    The mechanics of twisting somersaults is considered from a theoretical\u000d\u000a      perspective in a four part research article [3.1]. The mechanics\u000d\u000a      of rigid body aerial motion shows that there are two modes of motion: the\u000d\u000a      twisting somersault and the wobbling somersault. This provides a basis for\u000d\u000a      understanding more complex motions of a multi-segmented system which can\u000d\u000a      move from one mode of motion to another. The abilities of contact and\u000d\u000a      aerial techniques to initiate and control twist are established using\u000d\u000a      computer simulations of an 11-segment link model of the human body. A\u000d\u000a      method is presented for partitioning twisting techniques used in recorded\u000d\u000a      performances into a contact component and aerial components corresponding\u000d\u000a      to symmetrical movements, asymmetrical arm movements and asymmetrical hip\u000d\u000a      movements. The key findings are that (a) twist may be initiated during the\u000d\u000a      flight phase aerial using asymmetrical arm and hip movements to produce\u000d\u000a      tilt of the longitudinal axis away from the vertical somersault plane, (b)\u000d\u000a      tilt may also be removed using asymmetrical movements resulting in the\u000d\u000a      cessation of twist, (c) aerial techniques make a greater contribution than\u000d\u000a      contact techniques to twisting in elite trampolining performances [3.1].\u000d\u000a    Subsequent articles [3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5] apply the method of\u000d\u000a      partitioning twisting techniques to competitive performances in\u000d\u000a      springboard diving, rings dismounts, high bar dismounts, and twisting\u000d\u000a      somersaults on floor. Again it was found that aerial techniques make a\u000d\u000a      greater contribution than contact techniques. The limits of aerial\u000d\u000a      twisting techniques in the aerials event of freestyle skiing are\u000d\u000a      established in [3.6] by optimising simulated performance for 10\u000d\u000a      aerial twisting techniques using specific asymmetrical movements of arms\u000d\u000a      and hips. The article provides detailed analyses of the 10 techniques. The\u000d\u000a      key finding is that (d) a maximum of six twists will be possible in a\u000d\u000a      triple somersault.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42657","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Over the last three years, Dr Buchan's research involving HIT has\u000d\u000a      resulted in a number of media outlets publicising his work which has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the debate and highlighted awareness of the importance of\u000d\u000a      physical activity for health and well-being. Findings of the research were\u000d\u000a      aired on the BBC 1 show The One Show in January 2011 which provided an\u000d\u000a      excellent opportunity to raise awareness of the general public to the\u000d\u000a      benefits of short duration HIT for enhancing health and well- being. The\u000d\u000a      findings have also been featured in more than 385 distinct mainstream\u000d\u000a      media outlets, ranging from well-known outlets such as ScienceDaily and\u000d\u000a      the Daily Telegraph to smaller newspapers, International fitness magazines\u000d\u000a      such as Shape and Viz as well as blogs on sports and medicine. The\u000d\u000a      research findings were also highlighted in several foreign-language\u000d\u000a      outlets, including Russian, Greek and Norwegian local websites.\u000d\u000a    As a direct consequence of this media exposure, Dr Buchan has been\u000d\u000a      approached by other organizations and individuals who share the same\u000d\u000a      passion for the improvement of health and well-being in youth through\u000d\u000a      physical activity. Two collaborative investigations currently underway\u000d\u000a      with key stakeholders are detailed below:\u000d\u000a    4.1 The development and implementation of a planned and progressive\u000d\u000a        curriculum based Physical Education programme for pre-school and P1\u000d\u000a        pupils.\u000d\u000a    This programme has been implemented in collaboration with a number of key\u000d\u000a      stakeholders that include; NHS Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire Council,\u000d\u000a      Glasgow University and South Lanarkshire Education. This collaborative\u000d\u000a      project, which involves Dr Buchan as the Lead Investigator, will\u000d\u000a      investigate the effects of a Physical Education intervention upon measures\u000d\u000a      of health and well-being in youth.\u000d\u000a    Eight primary schools have accepted our invitation for involvement in the\u000d\u000a      project which is currently underway. During the participant recruitment\u000d\u000a      sessions responses from parents have been extremely positive with nearly\u000d\u000a      all parents in agreement of the importance of programmes to enhance their\u000d\u000a      child's health and well-being. The programme also involves up-skilling\u000d\u000a      teaching staff across South Lanarkshire, with a view to improving physical\u000d\u000a      activity levels and cardiometabolic health in Scottish youth. Teacher\u000d\u000a      training events have been undertaken with a number of practitioners, and\u000d\u000a      initial feedback of the Physical Education intervention has been extremely\u000d\u000a      positive.\u000d\u000a    Building upon the well-established evidence that has demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      children who have well developed fundamental movement skills are more\u000d\u000a      likely to participate in physical activity and are more likely to become\u000d\u000a      active adolescents, this project has the unique ability to develop these\u000d\u000a      key fundamental movement skills at the onset of primary education.\u000d\u000a      Increasing physical activity levels are often cited by the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government as a key pledge in recent policy documents as a means of\u000d\u000a      preventing overweight, obesity and associated health implications. This\u000d\u000a      project can therefore become a catalyst for initiating national level\u000d\u000a      change within the PE curriculum so that children develop key fundamental\u000d\u000a      skills to assist them in becoming active adolescents and adults through\u000d\u000a      continued physical activity participation.\u000d\u000a    4.2 Collaborative research partnership with the Scottish Ethnic\u000d\u000a        Minority Sports Association.\u000d\u000a    Directly resulting from the media exposure of the HIT research, Dr\u000d\u000a      Buchan's research group was invited to discuss its findings and\u000d\u000a      implications with members of the Scottish Ethnic Minority Sports\u000d\u000a      Association (SEMSA). The subsequent meeting and discussion of findings led\u000d\u000a      to the commencement of a study early in 2012 to examine the prevalence of\u000d\u000a      cardiovascular disease risk factors among Scottish South Asians.

Lack of\u000d\u000a      time is often cited as a common determinant of exercise participation\u000d\u000a      regardless of sex, age, ethnicity or health status (Buchan et al, 2011a).\u000d\u000a      Recently, a growing body of evidence has found that the adaptations\u000d\u000a      typically associated with traditional endurance exercise may also occur\u000d\u000a      through low volume, high-intensity interval training (HIT) (Burgomaster et\u000d\u000a      al, 2008). Nonetheless, this work and others similar have been conducted\u000d\u000a      with adult populations and involve laboratory based protocols on a cycle\u000d\u000a      ergometer which has little practical usability for the general public.\u000d\u000a      Also, the use of HIT interventions is often perceived as unpractical and\u000d\u000a      intolerable by the general population, including youth.\u000d\u000a    Since 2010 Dr Buchan's research work (Buchan et al, 2011a, b; 2013),\u000d\u000a      conducted at UWS, has set out to establish that HIT interventions are a\u000d\u000a      safe and practical means of improving health and well- being within youth\u000d\u000a      populations. The purpose of these studies therefore was to develop a PA\u000d\u000a      intervention which could be readily undertaken by youth and within the\u000d\u000a      school environment. These studies determined the effects of HIT programmes\u000d\u000a      upon a number of health and well-being measures which included: weight,\u000d\u000a      BMI, blood pressure, physical fitness and cardiometabolic health which\u000d\u000a      involved the measurement of a number of metabolic markers of health such\u000d\u000a      as glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein and cholesterol.\u000d\u000a    Overall the findings from these studies confirmed that it is feasible to\u000d\u000a      implement HIT interventions within the school setting for youth and for\u000d\u000a      them to adhere to a rigorous protocol. Positive improvements were noted in\u000d\u000a      physical fitness measures (Buchan et al, 2011a, b; 2013), as well as a\u000d\u000a      reduction in systolic blood pressure (Buchan et al, 2011a), although no\u000d\u000a      improvements were noted in any of the metabolic measures. As our studies\u000d\u000a      have used apparently healthy adolescent cohorts, it is unsurprising that\u000d\u000a      limited changes have occurred in the metabolic profiles of cohorts post\u000d\u000a      intervention.\u000d\u000a    The main aim of Dr Buchan's HIT research was to develop an intervention\u000d\u000a      that is not labour or time intensive, not expensive, and not difficult to\u000d\u000a      implement, but which is modifiable and can provide valid and reliable\u000d\u000a      measurements of intensity and duration. The school environment, and in\u000d\u000a      particular physical education, affords an ideal setting to practice\u000d\u000a      health-promoting behaviours and is widely recognized as an important\u000d\u000a      setting for collaborative intervention. Over the past three years, Dr\u000d\u000a      Buchan has worked with local high schools, teachers and education\u000d\u000a      authorities to establish the feasibility of HIT in youth which is now\u000d\u000a      established. Given the time constraints of school curricula, incorporating\u000d\u000a      a HIT protocol into the physical education curriculum can function to\u000d\u000a      improve the health and well-being of youth populations.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42773","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The research was conducted on-site at University Hospital Aintree in\u000d      collaborations with members of the surgical and multi-disciplinary team.\u000d      That physical fitness had an impact on survival in this group of patients\u000d      was therefore rapidly disseminated to all members of the surgical and\u000d      inter-disciplinary team at University Hospital Aintree.\u000d    As a consequence of this research, a business case was presented by the\u000d      surgical and multidisciplinary team to the local NHS Trust to expand the\u000d      pre-operative service of CPET to incorporate such testing pre- and\u000d      post-chemotherapy. The business case noted that:\u000d    \"It is now clear that although chemotherapy may reduce tumour size and\u000d      improve operability, this may actually worsen cardiorespiratory fitness.\u000d      It is therefore necessary to perform pre-operative CPX testing twice on\u000d      these patients. Once before the chemotherapy to ensure they are suitable\u000d      candidates for surgery and chemotherapy, and then again after chemotherapy\u000d      to ensure they are still fit for surgery.\"\u000d    This would result in a doubling of the volume of such testing completed\u000d      during each year. Based upon the research, the objectives of the proposal\u000d      were\u000d    \"To identify those patients undergoing major elective colorectal surgery\u000d      at highest risk of post-operative complications and to plan elective\u000d      post-operative admission to the critical care unit\u000d    To identify lower risk patients that can be transferred directly to the\u000d      ward post-operatively\u000d    To identify patients who are at particularly high risk, and for whom\u000d      non-surgical treatment options may be more appropriate\u000d    To provide capacity for referral of patients from other surgical\u000d      specialties considered to be at high risk for CPX testing in order to aid\u000d      assessment of peri-operative risk\"\u000d    The benefits (impact) of the proposal were considered to be:\u000d    \"...predominantly clinical quality benefits, but there may be some cost\u000d      benefits associated with reductions in morbidity and overall length of\u000d      stay (critical care and hospital stay) and reductions in unplanned\u000d      critical care admissions in this group of patients.\"\u000d    The business case was successful; as a result all patients now undergoing\u000d      chemotherapy for UGI cancer will undertake pre- and post- chemotherapy\u000d      exercise testing for the determination of lactate threshold and maximal\u000d      oxygen uptake. This represents a change from previous policy at this\u000d      hospital where patients were tested for physical fitness (though not\u000d      routinely) only after chemotherapy. This change has been introduced as the\u000d      underpinning research has indicated that those with low physical fitness\u000d      prior to chemotherapy have significantly reduced survival in the\u000d      post-surgery period. Hence, if pre-chemotherapy exercise testing indicates\u000d      low physical fitness then such patients will not undergo chemotherapy, but\u000d      will still undergo surgery unless physical fitness is severely impaired.\u000d    All patients now undergo exercise testing prior to surgery, whereas\u000d      previously only those perceived \"at risk\" (normally based on age) were\u000d      tested. This provides an objective indicator of outcome such that the\u000d      surgical team can both choose whether or not to operate, but also can\u000d      consider potential alternative methods of operation.\u000d    The beneficiaries of the impact of this research are therefore the\u000d      patients and the NHS trust within which University Hospital Aintree\u000d      resides. Patients are benefitted as they may be placed at a lower risk of\u000d      death following surgery by not undergoing chemotherapy if physical fitness\u000d      is low. Alternatively, unnecessarily risky operations may not be\u000d      undertaken. The NHS trust is benefitted as by identifying those\u000d      individuals most at risk, and thus avoiding unnecessarily risky\u000d      operations, this policy should bring about a reduction in mortality and\u000d      morbidity. Furthermore, an understanding of the risk to each individual\u000d      patient should bring about an improvement in the planning of the\u000d      post-operative period (i.e. critical care bed or to the ward).

This has been based on previously published data\u000d      demonstrating that physical fitness measured via CPET is a predictor of\u000d      risk in the peri- and post-operative period in patients undergoing major\u000d      intra-abdominal (lower torso) surgery.\u000d    However, prior to our undertaking research in this area, whether risk\u000d      during and following major upper GI (upper torso) surgery is also related\u000d      to physical fitness was not known.

Much of this discussion\u000d      was centred on the book's focus on revising commonly held myths about\u000d      rugby in Munster and tangibly influenced public discourse in that regard.\u000d      The research for the book on Munster Rugby featured heavily on online\u000d      discussion fora and in email correspondence from fans of the Munster Rugby\u000d      sports team. There was also a feature length article in the Limerick\u000d        Leader newspaper when the book was published. The book revised and\u000d      challenged many popular assumptions about the history of rugby in Munster,\u000d      particularly the popularly promoted idea that the game is `classless' in\u000d      the province. Indeed, class formed the subject matter of press reviews,\u000d      particularly one written by the playwright John Breen in the Irish\u000d        Examiner. This was followed by a review in Cork's Evening Echo\u000d      (readership 76,000) in which it was stated that: `Rugby in Munster: A\u000d      Social and Cultural History is a compelling read. Its narrative unravels\u000d      many of the highly complex mysteries of rugby in Munster. It puts into\u000d      context the opinions, grudges, loyalties and traditions that have evolved\u000d      since the game was first played here in the 1870s.'\u000d    The research also succeeded in reaching people in the Irish peripheries\u000d      as a `hard to reach' sub- group. In this case, the book provoked dozens of\u000d      comments on the popular `People's Republic of Cork' blog &#8212; a very active\u000d      discussion forum patronised by people living in this county of South West\u000d      Ireland. Debate about the findings of the book also dominated the\u000d      Cork-based newspaper The Irish Examiner's (circulation 43,000 JNLR figure)\u000d      internet discussion forum in November 2011. Rugby in Munster\u000d      formed the basis of media interviews on RTE Radio's Sport at Seven, The\u000d        Irish Times, and The Wall Street Journal and Dublin's\u000d      98fm.The WSJ (circulation 2,118,315, American Audit Bureau of\u000d      Circulations) featured the research, where it underpinned a discussion on\u000d      the business and marketing model used by Munster rugby (April 30, 2010).\u000d      This interview also drew upon O'Callaghan's research into the professional\u000d      evolution of Munster rugby and the contrived nature of the modern\u000d      provincial unity enjoyed by the Munster team and fans: `Nobody foresaw\u000d      this when rugby union went professional in 1995. Liam O'Callaghan, a\u000d      historian at Liverpool Hope University whose doctoral thesis examines\u000d      Munster rugby, said that \"they were playing three times a year in the\u000d      Irish inter-provincial championship, often in front of three-figure\u000d      crowds, and the occasional match against a touring team.

The interviewer,\u000d      Greg Allen probed O'Callaghan on three issues: the modern Munster rugby\u000d      phenomenon and his argument that this is based on an egalitarian myth, the\u000d      relationship between the team and its home ground, something that he has\u000d      again attributed to myth and the manner in which the game has historically\u000d      given rise to parochial identities. These issues were of particular\u000d      interest to the rugby-following public as, again, they involved the\u000d      revision of key aspects of the Munster team's historical self-perception.\u000d    More pervasive has been the impact of the research in influencing public\u000d      discourse surrounding an institution of popular cultural acclaim in\u000d      Ireland (the Munster rugby team) through fan internet forums and message\u000d      boards. For example one blogger (thetrueball.com) has commented that: `it\u000d      has become quite the fashion in Irish rugby circles to champion the cause\u000d      of the game in Limerick as proof that in Ireland at least, the game is\u000d      classless, or rather cross-class.

Dr Salo's\u000d\u000a      close working relationship with\u000d\u000a      UK Athletics has allowed him to translate the acquired knowledge directly\u000d\u000a      to the very highest level\u000d\u000a      of the sport. While research on elite athletes is inherently difficult and\u000d\u000a      changes are in most cases\u000d\u000a      practically impossible to quantify at the athlete level due to so many\u000d\u000a      extraneous variables, it can be\u000d\u000a      clearly demonstrated that UK Athletics and British Bob Skeleton have\u000d\u000a      changed their practices, and\u000d\u000a      that both coaches and athletes appreciate and value the insights drawn\u000d\u000a      from Dr Salo's work.\u000d\u000a    Using research to inform professional work and practice: The\u000d\u000a      research from paper 1 improved\u000d\u000a      understanding of key issues in 4x100 m relay exchanges and how to measure\u000d\u000a      these baton\u000d\u000a      exchanges.

This work also prompted\u000d\u000a      UK Athletics to adapt\u000d\u000a      and develop a new approach which included inviting and supporting Dr Salo\u000d\u000a      to attend pre-competition\u000d\u000a      training camps and to be part of the support team at major Championships.\u000d\u000a      During the\u000d\u000a      current REF cycle, Dr Salo has analysed over 90% of all British national\u000d\u000a      senior relay team activities\u000d\u000a      (52 relay training sessions and 49 relay competitions). These include the\u000d\u000a      following preparation\u000d\u000a      camps and Championships: Beijing Olympics 2008, Berlin World Championships\u000d\u000a      2009, Barcelona\u000d\u000a      European Championships 2010, Daegu World Championships 2011 and London\u000d\u000a      Olympics 2012\u000d\u000a      [15].

Each workshop included up\u000d\u000a      to 10 of the best male\u000d\u000a      and female sprinters in the UK. The purpose of these workshops was to go\u000d\u000a      through performances\u000d\u000a      from the previous summer and to learn lessons for the future. While the\u000d\u000a      target audience as top\u000d\u000a      athletes is inevitably limited by the elite nature of the group, the same\u000d\u000a      message reaches broader\u000d\u000a      audiences via the coaches, as they coach wider groups of athletes\u000d\u000a      (including youth). Further\u000d\u000a      workshops have been held for hurdle coaches in November 2011 and December\u000d\u000a      2012 (15-20\u000d\u000a      coaches in each). Key topics in these presentations were the further\u000d\u000a      insight into hurdling technique\u000d\u000a      found in paper 2 (technique changes when fatigued and how take-off\u000d\u000a      distances are related to\u000d\u000a      running velocity). These workshops were the first time that these issues\u000d\u000a      had been introduced into\u000d\u000a      formal coach education in the UK. The National Event coach for hurdles at\u000d\u000a      UK Athletics (who has\u000d\u000a      personally coached athletes to ten Olympic or World Championship Gold\u000d\u000a      medals) has utilised this\u000d\u000a      insight in his coaching over the last few years: \"I have worked with Dr\u000d\u000a        Aki Salo on various sprint\u000d\u000a        and hurdles related projects since 1998. All this time, he has been able\u000d\u000a        to uniquely explain\u000d\u000a        biomechanics and research issues with very applied and understandable\u000d\u000a        way to help my coaching\u000d\u000a        processes. For example, in the early 2000's, Dr Salo's work revealed how\u000d\u000a        hurdle take-off distance\u000d\u000a        is dependent on running velocity, which helped me to implement changes\u000d\u000a        to my athletes' running\u000d\u000a        technique. I am still using the same principles with my current athletes\u000d\u000a        who include, for example,\u000d\u000a        Lawrence Clark (4th at the London Olympics 2012 in 110 m hurdles) and\u000d\u000a        Andrew Pozzi (4th at the\u000d\u000a        2012 World Indoor Championships in 60 m hurdles).\" [18]. Further,\u000d\u000a      based on the research in paper\u000d\u000a      5, Dr Salo and UK Athletics have analysed critical step length and step\u000d\u000a      frequency values from all\u000d\u000a      100 m finalists in the UK Championships since 2005 to inform coaches on\u000d\u000a      their athletes' technique\u000d\u000a      [15]. Consequently, this work has reached all 80 male and female finalists\u000d\u000a      and their coaches in the\u000d\u000a      current REF cycle.\u000d\u000a    Stimulated practitioner debate and wider dissemination: Dr Salo's\u000d\u000a      work has also found wider\u000d\u000a      national and international non-science audience &#8212; for example, paper 5 was\u000d\u000a      specifically discussed\u000d\u000a      in American coaching web-sites and blogs in spring 2011 [19]. His applied\u000d\u000a      research work with UK\u000d\u000a      Athletics (based on papers 1, 3, 4 &amp; 5) has been featured in the\u000d\u000a      Universities UK reports on \"the\u000d\u000a      Impact of Universities\" and \"The Impact of University Research and Sports\u000d\u000a      Development\" as well\u000d\u000a      as in mass media including international news agencies, newspapers and\u000d\u000a      national TV in 2012 [20].\u000d\u000a      This work also received governing body endorsement with an honourable\u000d\u000a      mention from the\u000d\u000a      European Athletics Association [14].\u000d\u000a    Influence on policy: Dr Salo's work at the Berlin World\u000d\u000a      Championships in 2009 forced the\u000d\u000a      International Association of Athletics Federations to clarify and modify\u000d\u000a      their relay running rules (the\u000d\u000a        definition of the exact starting point of the baton exchange) in the\u000d\u000a      following autumn [15].\u000d\u000a    Changed practice and influence on professional standards: The\u000d\u000a      impact and benefit of Dr\u000d\u000a      Salo's research is not limited only to athletics sprinting. Based on\u000d\u000a      research knowledge and findings\u000d\u000a      on sprint start and sprinting (papers 3-5), UK Sport and British Bob\u000d\u000a      Skeleton contracted the\u000d\u000a      University of Bath to translate his expertise to the bob skeleton start in\u000d\u000a      2012-2014 [21]. This\u000d\u000a      demonstrates that Dr Salo's research can be transferred to and have an\u000d\u000a      impact across other sports\u000d\u000a      and this project is the first of its kind for bob skeleton.

Athletes are important role models and an increase in\u000d\u000a      participation as a result of their\u000d\u000a      success can be strongly linked to wider social and economic benefits. For\u000d\u000a      example, athletics (the\u000d\u000a      major sport researched in this case study) has seen a 25% surge in\u000d\u000a      participation in England since\u000d\u000a      the London 2012 Olympic Games (Sport England Active People Survey 7, June\u000d\u000a      2013).

In line with our Integrative Human Performance\u000d\u000a      research group focus,\u000d\u000a      the main aim of his research is to understand the fundamental principles\u000d\u000a      underlying performance in\u000d\u000a      order to improve an individual athlete's technique and efficiency. He\u000d\u000a      specialises in the technique of\u000d\u000a      elite sprinters and hurdlers. Research on elite athletes is inherently\u000d\u000a      difficult, as athletes and their\u000d\u000a      coaches are generally hesitant to participate in research due to fear of\u000d\u000a      making changes to their\u000d\u000a      normal training.\u000d\u000a    Paper 1: This research in 2000-2001 carried out in Bath (supported\u000d\u000a      by a grant from UK Athletics\u000d\u000a      [7]) investigated relay exchanges utilising British national men's 4x100 m\u000d\u000a      team as participants. The\u000d\u000a      core of this squad comprised World Championship 4x100 m medallists. This\u000d\u000a      research identified the\u000d\u000a      best baton change-over distances in the exchange area, athletes' running\u000d\u000a      velocity patterns and\u000d\u000a      their interaction with each other.\u000d\u000a    Paper 2: This is the first paper in sprint hurdling that assessed\u000d\u000a      the effect of fatigue and different\u000d\u000a      running velocities (at different parts of the run) on hurdle clearances.\u000d\u000a      The research was fully\u000d\u000a      conducted in Bath in 2000-2004 and was partly supported by a Royal Society\u000d\u000a      grant [6]. The\u000d\u000a      participants included World Championship and Olympic athletes. This\u000d\u000a      research found critical\u000d\u000a      technique elements that appeared when fatigued and what happens to\u000d\u000a      technique when the\u000d\u000a      athletes do not reach the right take-off distance. Also, this paper\u000d\u000a      demonstrated how changing\u000d\u000a      running velocity alters the take-off distance and hurdle clearance path,\u000d\u000a      which has not been\u000d\u000a      considered in coach education previously.\u000d\u000a    Paper 3: This research was conducted in Bath in 2004-2006 when Ian\u000d\u000a      Bezodis was a PhD student\u000d\u000a      and Dr Salo was his lead supervisor (Prof. Kerwin, who was a\u000d\u000a      co-supervisor, was also employed\u000d\u000a      by the University of Bath until autumn 2005). The research was partly\u000d\u000a      supported by Dr Salo's\u000d\u000a      grants from UK Athletics [8-9, 11]. The mechanics of sprinting has been\u000d\u000a      rarely examined with true\u000d\u000a      elite athletes running at high velocities. Participants in this research\u000d\u000a      included an Olympic relay gold\u000d\u000a      medal winner whose 100 m personal best was under 10 seconds. Elite\u000d\u000a      athletes are a very specific\u000d\u000a      group and it is difficult or impossible to predict their technique based\u000d\u000a      on the performance of lower\u000d\u000a      level athletes. This paper highlighted that the role of muscles around the\u000d\u000a      knee joint in maximal\u000d\u000a      velocity sprinting may be different to that previously believed to be the\u000d\u000a      case.\u000d\u000a    Paper 4 (and presentation receiving award in 2009 [13]): This\u000d\u000a      research, which was carried out in\u000d\u000a      2006-2009 and partly supported by grants from UK Athletics [9, 11],\u000d\u000a      provided insight into the most\u000d\u000a      important and appropriate measure of the sprint start and how the best\u000d\u000a      starts are performed. This\u000d\u000a      study proved that previous research had overlooked the correct performance\u000d\u000a      measure in sprint\u000d\u000a      starts. Without the right performance outcome, one cannot provide athletes\u000d\u000a      and coaches with\u000d\u000a      appropriate advice. Participants in this research included several\u000d\u000a      athletes who had reached the\u000d\u000a      finals either at the European or World Indoor Championships during the\u000d\u000a      previous two years. This\u000d\u000a      research was carried out in Bath when Neil Bezodis was a PhD student (Dr\u000d\u000a      Salo was his lead\u000d\u000a      supervisor and Dr Trewartha co-supervisor; Dr Trewartha has also been\u000d\u000a      employed by the\u000d\u000a      University of Bath over the whole time period of this research; currently\u000d\u000a      as Senior Lecturer).\u000d\u000a    Paper 5: This is the first paper to longitudinally assess a group\u000d\u000a      of world absolute top elite sprinters,\u000d\u000a      most of whom ran under 10 seconds several times during the study period\u000d\u000a      (partly supported by\u000d\u000a      grants from UK Athletics [8-9,12] and Leverhulme Trust [10]). The\u000d\u000a      literature contains many debates\u000d\u000a      about whether step length (SL) or step frequency (SF) is the most critical\u000d\u000a      factor in sprinting (based\u000d\u000a      on average performances of groups). However, elite athletes need to 'fine\u000d\u000a      tune' their own\u000d\u000a      performance and this research found that some athletes were more SL\u000d\u000a      reliant and some more SF\u000d\u000a      reliant. This has implications for athlete preparation for competition.\u000d\u000a      For example, SL-reliant\u000d\u000a      athletes might need to focus more on force and flexibility whereas\u000d\u000a      SF-reliant athletes might be\u000d\u000a      better concentrating on nervous system considerations. All co-authors were\u000d\u000a      in Bath when the main\u000d\u000a      bulk of this research was conducted in 2003-2005. Dr Batterham carried out\u000d\u000a      further statistical\u000d\u000a      analysis after he had moved to the University of Teesside.

ParticipACTION is a not-for-profit\u000a      organisation solely dedicated to inspiring and supporting healthy and\u000a      active living for Canadians. In 2010-12, ParticipACTION launched a\u000a      multi-million dollar national media campaign including television and\u000a      radio adverts, newspaper articles, and toolkits specifically developed for\u000a      health practitioners, teachers, parents and children. The announcement of\u000a      the new guidelines by ParticipACTION generated more than 100 million\u000a      earned media impressions [11] and over 50% of parents of 7-12 years olds\u000a      reported that they had become more active as a family, spoken to their\u000a      children about being more active, or established stricter rules regarding\u000a      sedentary behaviour, as a result of viewing the ParticipACTION campaign\u000a      [12]. In addition, as described by the CEO of Active Healthy Kids Canada \"the\u000a        Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for children serve as a\u000a        scientifically grounded benchmark against which the physical activity\u000a        levels of Canadian youth are assessed\" [13].

The British\u000a      Heart Foundation National Centre for physical activity and health has used\u000a      the guidelines to develop a resource for people directly involved with the\u000a      promotion of physical activity to children (e.g., teachers, youth workers,\u000a      public health commissioners) helping them to interpret the guidelines to\u000a      inform their practice [18].\u000a    Locally, Gillison and Standage have used their research to influence\u000a      strategy and policies for children's health and wellness within Bath and\u000a      North East Somerset. This includes tailored recommendations to meet\u000a      specific local needs\/challenges [e.g., Grant 3]; including direction on\u000a      how to produce resources which engage parents with local obesity\u000a      prevention strategies [19], and input into the design and content of an\u000a      initiative to replace Healthy Schools (The Director of Public Health\u000a      Award) [20]. This package was adopted by 41% of local schools in its first\u000a      year.\u000a    National and Local Policy and Practice &#8212; Energy Requirements\u000a    The revised Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) co-produced by Riddoch and\u000a      published by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition are reported\u000a      directly to Public Health England, the Department of Health and other\u000a      government departments. The advice given to health professionals and those\u000a      planning menus for specific groups in the UK since 2011 has been changed\u000a      [21] and so too has the generic advice to the general public via NHS\u000a      Choices [22].\u000a    National Policy and Practice &#8212; UK National Curriculum\u000a    The BtBYCB London 2012 initiative which Standage, Cumming, and Gillison\u000a      helped to refine, improve and evaluate [23] was successfully launched by\u000a      21st Century Legacy in March 2011. The aim of 21st\u000a      Century is to have 80% of secondary schools in the UK participating in the\u000a      BtBYCB programme by 2016 [24]. HRH the Princess Royal provided the\u000a      following endorsment \"The BtBYCB programme is a great way to help\u000a        fulfil the promise that the London 2012 Olympic Games would be an\u000a        inspiration to the youth of Britain and the rest of the world. The\u000a        Programme, which inspires, engages and empowers young people, gives them\u000a        the opportunity to find their unique potential and to follow their\u000a        dreams\" [24]. By July 2013, BtBYCB had already been delivered to\u000a      over 115,000 pupils in a diverse range of schools across England,\u000a      Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland [25]. The programme has a broader\u000a      reach than physical activity alone as indicated in the following statement\u000a      from the founder of 21st Century Legacy, \"Schools report\u000a        that the enthusiasm generated by BtBYCB, driven by the programme's focus\u000a        on personal agenda, is leading to increased aspirations in other areas\u000a        of students' lives\" [23]. The development of the programme received\u000a      support from the Chair of Ofsted who commented that the unique\u000a      characteristics of BtBYCB \"...gives your dynamic project a real\u000a        credibility that is not often found in other projects whose aspirations\u000a        may be similar\" [26]. In April 2012, the BtBYCB initiative was\u000a      integrated into the New Curriculum for Secondary Schools (under the\u000a      subject heading of PSHE; Key Stage 3). That is, via ASDAN Education, the\u000a      completion of BtBYCB now results in 3-credits towards the Certificate of\u000a      Personal Effectiveness GCSE equivalent qualification [24].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted at the University of Bath has influenced policy and\u000a      practice regarding the promotion of physical activity and wellbeing in\u000a      youth. Canadian and UK governments have revised their physical activity\u000a      guidelines and recommendations for children and adolescents based on\u000a      research co-produced by staff from Bath. In Canada, these revised physical\u000a      activity guidelines have been used by the not-for-profit organisation\u000a      ParticipACTION as the basis for multi-million dollar multimedia\u000a      advertising campaign which generated more than 100 million earned media\u000a      impressions. These revised guidelines are also being used in the\u000a      measurement and monitoring of national trends in physical activity in\u000a      large national surveys in Canada. In the UK, revised physical activity\u000a      guidelines have been directly distributed to key stakeholders and more\u000a      broadly disseminated to the public via NHS Choices and national charities\u000a      (e.g., British Heart Foundation).

The\u000a      researchers contributing to these impacts include psychologists Martyn\u000a      Standage (2002-present, Reader), Sean Cumming (2006-present, Senior\u000a      Lecturer), and Fiona Gillison (2007-present, Senior Lecturer), and an\u000a      epidemiologist, Chris Riddoch (2007 until retiring in July 2011,\u000a      Professor).\u000a    Riddoch is an expert in physical activity epidemiology, who published\u000a      over 40 peer-reviewed articles during his time at Bath. His work has been\u000a      pivotal in standardising and optimising methods for the use of\u000a      accelerometers as objective measures of physical activity and sedentary\u000a      behaviour, representing a significant advance in the study of physical\u000a      activity and health in children. In collaboration with colleagues at other\u000a      national and international Institutions, he established and led a series\u000a      of longitudinal epidemiological studies of child and adolescent health,\u000a      including the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and\u000a      European Youth Heart Study (EYHS) (e.g., Grant 1). Riddoch's research was\u000a      the first to establish accurate measures of physical activity in UK youth\u000a      with the alarming finding that fewer than 5% meet international\u000a      recommendations for physical activity [1]. This research simultaneously\u000a      demonstrated that prior self-report measures in children had drastically\u000a      underestimated the prevalence of inactivity in youth [1]. Following these\u000a      initial observations, Riddoch was the sole UK-based author of revised\u000a      evidence-based physical activity guidelines for Canada in 2010 &#8212; which\u000a      included more flexible and developmentally-appropriate guidelines for\u000a      children [2]. He was one of 15 international authors of a technical report\u000a      that recommended a revision to physical activity guidelines in the UK,\u000a      including guidelines for children [3]. He was one of 10 contributors in\u000a      the production of new UK Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) on behalf of the\u000a      Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (and the only physical activity\u000a      expert). This was the first update to DRVs since 1991 and proposed a\u000a      change (increase) based on improved evidence &#8212; especially improved\u000a      estimates of physical activity energy expenditure [4]. Finally, Riddoch\u000a      was one of 6 UK-based authors of an International Olympic Committee\u000a      consensus statement on physical activity and sport requirements for health\u000a      in youth [5].\u000a    Standage, Gillison &amp; Cumming have led research at Bath that (i) maps\u000a      the determinants of motivation towards sustained physical activity, and\u000a      (ii) applies this information to inform ecologically-based interventions\u000a      that promote physical activity, health and wellbeing in youth (e.g.,\u000a      Grants 2 &amp; 3). A primary contribution includes empirical and\u000a      theoretical additions to Self Determination Theory that are particularly\u000a      salient to physical activity [e.g., 6]. For example, school-based research\u000a      generated specific strategies for teachers and coaches to better support\u000a      children's motivation towards physical activity. These strategies range\u000a      from the applied conceptualisation of exercise `goal content' (i.e., what\u000a      people are aiming to achieve through exercise) [7] through to the\u000a      identification of specific strategies that can help teachers\/coaches to\u000a      promote sustained (autonomous) motivation, engagement, and \"out of school\"\u000a      activity in children [e.g., 6, 8]. In 2008, Bath were approached by the\u000a      Vice-chair of the British Olympic Association (Dr David Hemery, CBE) to\u000a      collaborate with the testing, refining, and developing of a London 2012\u000a      schools initiative, entitled `Be the Best You Can Be' (BtBYCB). The aim of\u000a      BtBYCB is to promote pupil well-being, aspirations and engagement in\u000a      health-promoting behaviours. Funded via an ESRC award (Grant 2), previous\u000a      empirical research from Bath [e.g., 6-8] was used to enhance BtBYCB in\u000a      terms of how the programme was delivered (e.g., degree of choice\u000a      provided to children in setting and reviewing goal content) and what\u000a      was delivered (e.g., inclusion of motivationally-adaptive materials and\u000a      engaging tasks). Subsequently, Standage, Cumming, and Gillison implemented\u000a      a cluster randomised controlled trial coupled within an innovative\u000a      mixed-methods component to evaluate BtBYCB in 1333 children and their\u000a      teachers [9]. Even though the results have not yet published, the work was\u000a      co-produced with the key stakeholders and the findings highlight key\u000a      characteristics of school-based initiatives that determine success (e.g.,\u000a      importance of teacher involvement and modelling). Gillison &amp; Standage\u000a      continue to expand and develop theoretically-based questions relevant to\u000a      physical activity in children and adolescents with local partners in\u000a      applied settings (e.g., Grant 3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43255","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Researchers at Bath have had significant impacts on reducing the burden\u000d\u000a      of injuries and illnesses in both sport and military training\u000d\u000a      environments. These impacts include knowledge transfer and engagement with\u000d\u000a      key stakeholder groups (e.g. practitioners), as well as changes to policy,\u000d\u000a      practice and outcomes with regards to personnel\/player welfare. Although\u000d\u000a      wider research dissemination is relatively recent, our stakeholders have\u000d\u000a      acted immediately based on the conclusions and recommendations submitted\u000d\u000a      in earlier reports, often long before journal publications.\u000d\u000a    Musculoskeletal Injuries in Military Training.\u000d\u000a    Based on our analysis of British Army Parachute Regiment training [1] the\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Defence implemented (i) evidence-based physical selection\u000d\u000a      criteria, (ii) a 2-week increase in training duration and (iii) the\u000d\u000a      introduction of a 1000 kcal per day nutritional training supplement in\u000d\u000a      (High Activity Training Supplement (HATS), implemented by Defence Food\u000d\u000a      Services Agency (DFSA) in 2008) [7]. This intervention has resulted in an\u000d\u000a      increase in recruit success rates during Parachute Regiment training (from\u000d\u000a      43 to 58%) and a substantial reduction of all-cause medical discharge\u000d\u000a      incidence during training from 14 to 5% [8]. The decision to implement\u000d\u000a      this intervention across all three military services was not taken lightly\u000d\u000a      by the MOD (the cost of implementation is ~&#163;2.5 million per annum).\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the nutritional supplement component has now been implemented\u000d\u000a      throughout all military initial training, thus benefiting approximately\u000d\u000a      20,000 trainees per year, or 80,000 trainees since inception in 2009 [7].\u000d\u000a      Early findings were disseminated to practitioners at the Occupational\u000d\u000a      &amp; Environmental Medicine Conference in November 2008 [8] and more\u000d\u000a      complete analyses to the Military Rehabilitation Conference at the ExCel\u000d\u000a      in London in November 2010 [9]. Whilst the initial research was focussed\u000d\u000a      on Parachute Regiment trainees, it has been used more generally to inform\u000d\u000a      wider British Army training policy and practices &#8212; for example, via the\u000d\u000a      implementation of physical selection standards and more progressive\u000d\u000a      training regimens throughout the army [10]. Our orthotic insole\u000d\u000a      intervention research with Royal Navy Officer Cadet trainees has also\u000d\u000a      resulted in a 50% reduction in time-loss lower limb injuries among\u000d\u000a      trainees [3], and has been implemented across the Royal Navy, affecting\u000d\u000a      some 3000 trainees per annum. It has also been used to inform and direct\u000d\u000a      related British Army research, leading to the implementation of a related\u000d\u000a      training risk reduction model [11]. As a result of research and expertise\u000d\u000a      in this area, Dr Bilzon was appointed by the Director General Army Medical\u000d\u000a      Services to act as Honorary Civilian Consultant Advisor in Sport &amp;\u000d\u000a      Exercise Science in January 2012. Based on conservative estimates from\u000d\u000a      British Army training alone, a health economist has estimated that,\u000d\u000a      collectively, this research into musculoskeletal injuries in the military\u000d\u000a      has contributed directly to an annual training delivery cost-saving of &#163;49\u000d\u000a      million associated with training completion rates and an additional &#163;13.5\u000d\u000a      million saving associated with a reduction in injury incidence since 2009\u000d\u000a      [10].\u000d\u000a    Exertional Heat Illness in military training.\u000d\u000a    A primary outcome from this research was that the incidence of exertional\u000d\u000a      heat illness was relatively high, ranging from 5-10% across the training\u000d\u000a      events monitored [4], affecting approximately 500 trainees per year.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, casualties were not being appropriately diagnosed and\u000d\u000a      treated. Our demonstration that all casualties had core body temperatures\u000d\u000a      &gt;39.502daC has heightened awareness of the gravity of the issue and led\u000d\u000a      to immediate changes in Army Recruiting &amp; Training Division medical\u000d\u000a      guidance to training establishments on the prevention and treatment for\u000d\u000a      heat-related illnesses. This included the use of the Glasgow Coma Scale to\u000d\u000a      monitor levels of consciousness and reporting to the medical centre for\u000d\u000a      clinical observation. This research was presented to the Army Recruiting\u000d\u000a      &amp; Training Division Research Working Group in 2010 and recommendations\u000d\u000a      incorporated into MOD-wide policy and medical research strategy. Our\u000d\u000a      research has therefore contributed directly to changes in trainee\u000d\u000a      healthcare policy, whereby all suspected heat illness cases will be\u000d\u000a      referred to the medical centre for monitoring and observation in a\u000d\u000a      controlled environment. This has and will continue to reduce the risk of\u000d\u000a      relapse and secondary complications among ~12,000 otherwise healthy\u000d\u000a      British Army trainees per annum [10].\u000d\u000a    Musculoskeletal Injuries in Sport &#8212; impact from injury surveillance\u000d\u000a        research.\u000d\u000a    The long-term injury surveillance research programmes from Bath that are\u000d\u000a      in place across the whole array of Rugby Union, from youth to premiership\u000d\u000a      rugby, have generated specific recommendations that are being used by the\u000d\u000a      RFU across all levels of rugby in their medical safety policy and have\u000d\u000a      been embedded into RFU coaching courses such as `Rugby Ready' since 2010\u000d\u000a      [12].

Since international and national sports\u000d\u000a      governing bodies and government agencies with stakeholder interest fund\u000d\u000a      our research, there is a direct and immediate route to impact.\u000d\u000a    Musculoskeletal injuries and illnesses in the military\u000d\u000a    Collectively, our research conducted in partnership with the MOD\u000d\u000a      identified physical fitness, energy balance, training progression, lower\u000d\u000a      limb biomechanics and cigarette smoking as independent risk factors for\u000d\u000a      musculoskeletal injury. Specifically, one holistic study conducted in\u000d\u000a      partnership with Optimal Performance Ltd identified that the physical\u000d\u000a      fitness selection standards were inappropriate, the physical training\u000d\u000a      programme was not progressive in nature and the dietary energy provision\u000d\u000a      for Parachute Regiment trainees was 1000 kcal\/day less than energy\u000d\u000a      expended during training [1]. Specific recommendations, addressing each of\u000d\u000a      these issues, were implemented and subsequently evaluated. A further\u000d\u000a      randomised controlled trial demonstrated a 50% reduction in lower limb\u000d\u000a      injuries among Royal Navy Officer Cadets following personal orthotic\u000d\u000a      insole intervention [2]. This study was conducted in partnership with Dr\u000d\u000a      Andrew Franklyn-Miller, a sports medicine physician based at the Defence\u000d\u000a      Medical Rehabilitation Centre Headley Court and as part of a University of\u000d\u000a      Bath PhD studentship (supervised by Bilzon). Based on our earlier\u000d\u000a      findings, and having previously noted the high incidence of Exertional\u000d\u000a      Heat Illness casualties in Parachute Regiment training [1], we conducted a\u000d\u000a      further MOD-funded prospective cohort study to assess incidence and\u000d\u000a      pathophysiology of Exertional Heat Illness in military trainees [3]. This\u000d\u000a      study was conducted under a MOD research contract to Bath (see Grant 2)\u000d\u000a      and in collaboration with Professor Neil Walsh (Bangor University) and\u000d\u000a      Professor Simon Jackson (University of Plymouth). The findings highlighted\u000d\u000a      the relatively high incidence of Exertional Heat Illness during different\u000d\u000a      military training events (5-10%) and the misclassification of the\u000d\u000a      condition and associated treatment by medical and training staff [3]. This\u000d\u000a      research also suggested a role for immune disturbance, particularly during\u000d\u000a      long duration (&gt;45 min) exercise, something that could potentially be\u000d\u000a      managed.\u000d\u000a    Musculoskeletal injuries in sport (rugby)\u000d\u000a    Our partnership with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) has taken an\u000d\u000a      epidemiological approach to understand injuries in a series of studies\u000d\u000a      (Grants 3-5) in youth, community, premiership and women's Rugby Union [4].\u000d\u000a      These findings quantify for the first time at all levels of the game the\u000d\u000a      relatively high incidence of injury associated with tackling and the high\u000d\u000a      severity of injuries associated with the scrum [4]. This has led to\u000d\u000a      further mechanistic studies, funded by the IRB (Grant 6), that demonstrate\u000d\u000a      the differences in player impact forces in the scrum when adopting\u000d\u000a      different methods of engagement with the opposition [5]. Importantly,\u000d\u000a      these studies demonstrated that impact forces in the scrum can be reduced\u000d\u000a      by changing the initial contact [5].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43276","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2411586","Name":"Gibraltar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The models and modelling approaches developed by Fletcher and Blake have\u000d\u000a      fed into the development of tourism-related and general economic policies\u000d\u000a      by a number of international organisations, national governments and\u000d\u000a      public authorities of various ranks. This is evidenced through a series of\u000d\u000a      examples.\u000d\u000a    Blake's work on dynamic modelling of tourism demand during the Olympics\u000d\u000a      (P3) developed new methodologies for estimating the impact of future\u000d\u000a      events. This accounts for the fact that businesses and other actors in the\u000d\u000a      economy anticipate these events and make changes to their activity many\u000d\u000a      years in advance. The model developed by Blake was used to estimate the\u000d\u000a      value of the London 2012 Olympics to the UK. It also showed the value of\u000d\u000a      the post-Olympic tourism legacy and economic gains that would be made by\u000d\u000a      London partly at the expense of the rest of the UK. These findings\u000d\u000a      contributed to the evidence base that led to policy changes, such as\u000d\u000a      promoting the need for destination image building during the Games and of\u000d\u000a      spreading the tourism benefits around the UK. This was delivered through\u000d\u000a      the work of the Nations and Regions Group, which identified opportunities\u000d\u000a      for tourism outside of London.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, Blake led a research project commissioned by the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government (R1) to estimate the size and economic contribution of wildlife\u000d\u000a      tourism in Scotland (G3). This involved the estimation of net impacts of\u000d\u000a      tourism, taking account of displacement (P1 &amp; P2). This project\u000d\u000a      estimated that wildlife tourists spent &#163;276 million in Scotland during\u000d\u000a      2009, which contributed &#163;65 million to Scotland's gross domestic product\u000d\u000a      (GDP) and 2,763 full-time equivalent jobs. This provided the evidence base\u000d\u000a      that led to VisitScotland naming 2013 the `Year of Natural Scotland' (R2\u000d\u000a      &amp; R3).\u000d\u000a    In 2010-11, Blake led a research project commissioned by UK Music &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      umbrella organisation for different elements of the UK music industry\u000d\u000a      (G5). The resulting publication Destination: Music (R4)\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that 7.7 million tourists travel to or within the UK to\u000d\u000a      attend music festivals or concerts. They spend &#163;1.4 billion during the\u000d\u000a      course of their trips, contributing &#163;864 million to the UK economy and\u000d\u000a      providing the equivalent of almost 20,000 full-time jobs. This project\u000d\u000a      took displacement into account in estimating the economic contribution of\u000d\u000a      this activity (P1 &amp; P2). This report was discussed in Parliament on 22\u000d\u000a      November 2011 (R5), and has led to the formation of a UK live music group\u000d\u000a      with representation by CEOs from music and events companies (R6). The\u000d\u000a      evidence base contained in this report also provided the basis for\u000d\u000a      increased lobbying by the industry for a greater representation of music\u000d\u000a      in VisitBritain's marketing, which has since included iconic music images\u000d\u000a      in its `Great Britain' campaign (R7).\u000d\u000a    In 2012, Blake conducted research for Tourism Respect to estimate the\u000d\u000a      economic impacts of implementing a reduced rate of VAT for accommodation\u000d\u000a      and visitor attractions (G8). This involved the construction of a CGE\u000d\u000a      model to estimate the net impact of displacement. This was in a dynamic\u000d\u000a      setting to show how activity changes in advance of any tax-change taking\u000d\u000a      place (P3). The results from this research demonstrate that such a policy\u000d\u000a      would boost GDP by between &#163;3 billion and &#163;4 billion per year while being\u000d\u000a      broadly revenue neutral. These results were presented to HM Treasury\u000d\u000a      officials in September 2012 (R8) who have used them in a briefing note to\u000d\u000a      ministers for possible consideration in future budgets. It has also been\u000d\u000a      used as the basis for industry lobbying (R9 &amp; R10) and is a key source\u000d\u000a      in the current debate on the levels of VAT in these sectors.\u000d\u000a    Since the 1980s, the UK Government and the Government of Gibraltar have\u000d\u000a      used the economic models developed by Fletcher to determine the impact of\u000d\u000a      various changes. These include the closure of HMS Dockyard, the closure of\u000d\u000a      the Royal Naval Hospital, the development of Gibraltar Ship Repair, the\u000d\u000a      opening of the frontier with Spain, the appeal against EU judgements on\u000d\u000a      regional selectivity with respect to Corporation Tax Rates, the operation\u000d\u000a      of off-shore economic activities, and the management of its online gaming\u000d\u000a      industry (G4).\u000d\u000a    In a letter to BU's Vice-Chancellor, the Chief Minister for Gibraltar\u000d\u000a      says the research by Fletcher has \"provided invaluable policy insights,\u000d\u000a      enabling appropriate planning and negotiating approaches to be made\"\u000d\u000a      (R11).\u000d\u000a    He continues: \"Specifically since 2008, Professor John Fletcher's\u000d\u000a      input-output model, suitably updated, has provided robust evidence for the\u000d\u000a      EU to support Gibraltar's offshore business, its right to determine its\u000d\u000a      own corporate tax rates and the current issues with respect to the online\u000d\u000a      gaming tax changes proposed by the UK. Furthermore, Professor Fletcher's\u000d\u000a      research into the economic impact of Gibraltar on the Campo de Gibraltar,\u000d\u000a      provided invaluable insights into the relationship between the two\u000d\u000a      economies and were welcomed by both sides of the frontier\" (R11).\u000d\u000a    To summarise, the economic modelling techniques developed by Blake and\u000d\u000a      Fletcher more accurately predict the outcome of events, policy changes or\u000d\u000a      other major economic decisions.

These have pioneered application of new approaches to\u000d\u000a      estimating the economic impacts of tourism activities.\u000d\u000a    Economic impact research has evolved since the 1970s with the use of\u000d\u000a      input-output models. These typically estimate static economic impacts that\u000d\u000a      are limited in their applicability. Building on these earlier models, more\u000d\u000a      recent research, in which Fletcher and Blake have been instrumental, has\u000d\u000a      extended and enhanced economic impact modelling in the following ways:\u000d\u000a    - The incorporation of the role of displacement, by which tourism\u000d\u000a        activity displaces other forms of activity through developments of\u000d\u000a        computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. P1 used a CGE model to\u000d\u000a      estimate the impacts of tourism showing that displacement caused by\u000d\u000a      tourism expenditure leads to reductions in manufacturing sectors. This in\u000d\u000a      part reduces the benefits tourism brings to some sections of the economy\u000d\u000a      and could lead to the overall impact of tourism on some groups being\u000d\u000a      negative (P2).\u000d\u000a    - The use of dynamic models to allow impacts of future events to be\u000d\u000a        seen before they take place (P3-P6). P3 is the first example of such\u000d\u000a      a dynamic model being used to estimate the economic impacts of tourism. It\u000d\u000a      showed that an event such as the Olympics can have impacts on economic\u000d\u000a      activity years in advance. This is due to anticipation that the event will\u000d\u000a      take place at a definite time in the future, and expectation of tourism\u000d\u000a      expenditures at that event. This methodology also enables the estimation\u000d\u000a      of expenditures in host cities as compared to the host country (P4-P6).\u000d\u000a    - The incorporation of forecasting functions and environmental impact\u000d\u000a        modules in user-friendly interfaces (G1 &amp; G2) and web interfaces\u000d\u000a        (G6). This allows the impact models that have been developed to have\u000d\u000a      a greater application, with users and policy makers able to generate new\u000d\u000a      sets of results to answer immediate questions. In the case of G6, this has\u000d\u000a      included a web-based questionnaire through which businesses in tourism\u000d\u000a      destinations input data regarding their firm's activity over a period of\u000d\u000a      time. These data sets are gathered through an online database to allow the\u000d\u000a      same firms to then access indicators that not only demonstrate their\u000d\u000a      economic and environmental impacts in their destination but also to\u000d\u000a      consider the performance of their business relative to the sector average,\u000d\u000a      minimum and maximum for each variable incorporated. For instance, a hotel\u000d\u000a      can see what contribution it makes to the local economy, what the\u000d\u000a      environmental consequences are and how well it is performing in terms of\u000d\u000a      energy usage, what its revenue per available room is compared with the\u000d\u000a      sector and even the proportion of its marketing costs in relation to its\u000d\u000a      sector.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43387","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This impact case study demonstrates how research carried out by the SESRC\u000d\u000a      has culminated in the development of a new recognised category of health\u000d\u000a      and wellness footwear, based upon `Microwobbleboard&#8482;' techology, which has\u000d\u000a      directly led to the creation and growth of a successful international\u000d\u000a      business, FitFlop Ltd.\u000d\u000a    Following a search of UK universities for relevant expertise in foot and\u000d\u000a      ankle biomechanics in 2006, the Founder of Brandhandling Ltd approached\u000d\u000a      the SESRC.

The research continues to be led by Dr Katya Mileva (Senior\u000d\u000a    Research Fellow, 2001 - to date) in collaboration with Dr David Cook (Senior\u000d\u000a    Lecturer, 2003 - left LSBU 2012) and Dr Darren James (Research Assistant,\u000d\u000a    2004 - 2012 and Research Fellow, 2012 - to date).\u000d\u000a    Specifically, research has explored interventions designed to promote\u000d\u000a      gait efficiency via modulation of the impact force during walking.\u000d\u000a      Research since 2004 has demonstrated altered temporal movement patterns\u000d\u000a      when wearing footwear compared to barefoot walking [1]. Further\u000d\u000a      experimental studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of\u000d\u000a      intrinsic foot muscles [2] and mechanical interventions involving\u000d\u000a      whole-body [3] or direct lower-limb [4] vibration enhance the\u000d\u000a      proprioceptive input from the foot and ankle complex.\u000d\u000a    In 2006, SESRC researchers developed a column-based mid-sole design,\u000d\u000a      comprising differing mid-sole densities, intended to mechanically\u000d\u000a      stimulate the wearer and effectively modulate the impact forces during\u000d\u000a      walking. The concept aimed to enhance the activity of the stabilising leg\u000d\u000a      muscles by creating a more active loading profile, pushing the wearer into\u000d\u000a      the middle section of the softer, `questioning' foot-bed zone earlier than\u000d\u000a      traditional footwear. The new technology was termed \"Microwobbleboard&#8482;\".\u000d\u000a    A 2006 study by the SESRC [5], funded by Brandhandling Ltd, evaluated the\u000d\u000a      effects of this new footwear on ground reaction force and muscle activity\u000d\u000a      during walking, compared to standard athletic footwear. The research found\u000d\u000a      significantly increased electromyographic amplitude of the lateral\u000d\u000a      stabilizer m. peroneus longus (12%); prolonged activation time of the\u000d\u000a      pelvis stabilizer m. gluteus maximus (42%), reduced stance time duration\u000d\u000a      and increased rate of force production during propulsion. These findings\u000d\u000a      indicate that the neuromuscular responses are more likely a result of the\u000d\u000a      specific characteristics of the footwear rather than being induced through\u000d\u000a      destabilisation only. The study results were independently verified by\u000d\u000a      research conducted by Drs Graham-Smith and Jones at Salford University.\u000d\u000a    The research findings confirmed the potential of exploring a soles'\u000d\u000a      construction to impact an individual's gait pattern via stimulation of the\u000d\u000a      peripheral sensory system during every step.\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, the SESRC has, with significant funding from FitFlop Ltd,\u000d\u000a      undertaken further research and development of the technology using\u000d\u000a      3-dimensional motion capture and neurophysiological methodologies. These\u000d\u000a      follow-up studies, based upon the FitFlop&#8482; sandal [6, 7], have: (i)\u000d\u000a      identified a 22% increase in shock absorption with interaction, (ii)\u000d\u000a      confirmed the enhanced activation of specific lower limb muscles and\u000d\u000a      reduced plantar pressures under the mid-foot and forefoot regions, (iii)\u000d\u000a      justified clinical implications in light of the significant reduction in\u000d\u000a      sagittal plane ankle joint range of motion and joint moment-related\u000d\u000a      indices.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43394","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Poor circulation is an increasing health problem in clinical (eg\u000a      diabetics, peripheral vascular disease) and non-clinical groups (eg.\u000a      obesity, pregnancy, high alcohol consumption and frequent long-haul flying\u000a      (economy class syndrome)). Worldwide an estimated 30 million people across\u000a      all age groups suffer with peripheral vascular disease, with over 100,000\u000a      people newly diagnosed each year in the UK alone.

Current treatment regimens rely on pharmaceutical and compression\u000a      therapies or surgical interventions, with highly variable efficacy and\u000a      demand on health-care resources.\u000a    SESRC's research has led to the development and subsequent retail of a\u000a      range of improved circulation boosters (Revitive&#8482; range) for and by Actegy\u000a      Ltd, a health device company based in Ascot.\u000a    In 2006, Actegy approached the SESRC to explore the possibility of it\u000a      marketing and selling a breathing device (YouBreathe) invented and\u000a      developed by the SESRC. As a result of this interaction, Actegy became\u000a      aware of the SESRC's expertise and knowledge in electro-mechanical\u000a      stimulation. In 2008, Actegy awarded the SESRC funding to evaluate the\u000a      physiological efficacy and performance of its Circulation Booster product\u000a      in order to provide scientific evidence to update and defend its\u000a      physiological performance claims. Actegy was able to provide sufficient\u000a      evidence to Advertising Standards Agency reviewers to justify the claimed\u000a      performance benefits (1) and to continue trading.\u000a    The results identified the opportunity to materially improve product\u000a      performance and to identify clinical indications such as diabetes. As a\u000a      consequence, in 2008, Actegy commissioned the SESRC to undertake a product\u000a      development programme aimed at expanding the range of advanced circulation\u000a      products based upon its current Circulation Booster technology. By 2011,\u000a      the SESRC's work had led to three differentiated products which Actegy\u000a      subsequently had manufactured and launched under its Revitive&#8482; range (2).\u000a      The IsoRocker, WidePulse and On\/Off ratio technologies developed by the\u000a      SESRC deliver a more natural user experience than comparable competitor\u000a      products. Patents applications on all three products were applied for by\u000a      Actegy during 2013 with SESRC staff named as inventors (3, 4, 5).\u000a    The new innovations are user focussed and improve the user experience.\u000a      The IsoRocker increases circulation and gives greater comfort during use.\u000a      The Wide-Pulse stimulation reduces the required voltage making the device\u000a      safer to use.

The research was undertaken by\u000a      Drs Paul Sumners (Research Fellow, 2003 to date), Katya Mileva (Senior\u000a      Research Fellow, 2001 to date) and Joanna Bowtell (Senior Lecturer, 1999 -\u000a      left LSBU in 2011).\u000a    The SESRC researchers have developed a considerable body of scientific\u000a      knowledge and expertise in physiological effects of electro-mechanical\u000a      interventions including electrical (1, 2), vibratory (3, 4) and magnetic\u000a      (4) stimulation. This has enabled the addition of novel research and\u000a      development programmes for improving human physical activity and health.\u000a    Research since 2001 using noxious and innocuous electrical nerve\u000a      stimulation demonstrated close coupling between muscle activation and\u000a      joint kinetics and kinematics via spinal reflex modulation (1). In 2008,\u000a      experiments were undertaken to determine the potential of novel electrical\u000a      stimulation parameters (1ms pulse width) to engage central neural circuits\u000a      and increase stability and structural integrity of the foot. The research\u000a      demonstrated potentiated intrinsic foot muscle activation and acute\u000a      beneficial impact from electrical foot stimulation on the coordination of\u000a      foot structures during subsequent movement (2).\u000a    These findings imply a potential for increased movement range and\u000a      enhanced plantar-venous plexus function thus producing an increased venous\u000a      ejection volume from the foot and calf structures. Enhanced muscle oxygen\u000a      dynamics and oxidative energy metabolism were also found during voluntary\u000a      exercises with superimposed vibration (3).Prolonged voluntary (5) and\u000a      vibration- evoked (4) muscle activity was also found to produce\u000a      significant modulation of the corticospinal excitability and the\u000a      peripheral excitatory and contractile processes.\u000a    This knowledge has enabled the development of novel technological\u000a      approaches for stimulation of the peripheral sensory receptors that could\u000a      be used during activity to improve exercise performance by simultaneously\u000a      enhancing muscle excitation, perfusion and oxygenation (3).\u000a    Building up from these results, the SESRC undertook a novel experimental\u000a      programme to investigate the effects of innocuous foot plantar surface\u000a      electrical stimulation on lower limb blood flow and swelling. In 2011 the\u000a      potential of this novel intervention to alleviate peripheral circulatory\u000a      deficits and associated pain and discomfort was compared to that of mild\u000a      voluntary contractions in a series of randomized controlled trials\u000a      utilising Doppler Ultrasound, Laser Doppler Flowmetry, Near-Infrared\u000a      Spectroscopy and Opto-electric Volumetry.\u000a    The findings demonstrated enhanced venous outflow and tissue perfusion,\u000a      improved muscle oxygenation and reduced swelling in healthy participants\u000a      with induced venous insufficiency via 40 minutes of immobility (6). These\u000a      factors had not previously been systematically investigated utilising foot\u000a      plantar surface stimulation.\u000a    Based upon these findings further experiments were designed to devise\u000a      approaches for enhanced physiological efficiency via improvements to the\u000a      existing plantar surface stimulation technology.\u000a    The research has demonstrated that:\u000a    \u000a      incorporation of a rocking mechanism to allow ankle movement during\u000a        stimulation leads to an increased venous ejection volume and more\u000a        natural movement patterns.\u000a      stimulation with wider pulses allows lower stimulation intensities to\u000a        be used to achieve efficient muscle activation similar to voluntary\u000a        recruitment patterns.\u000a      incorporating longer rest periods between evoked contractions allows\u000a        an increased efficiency of the muscle pump, enhanced venous return and\u000a        improved tissue oxygenation.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43682","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The guidelines developed by Gleeson for immunoendocrine monitoring of\u000a      athletes and strategies\u000a      to minimize risk of overtraining and infection were commissioned by UK\u000a      Sport and have since been\u000a      updated as an expert position statement (with a previous PhD student, Prof\u000a      Neil Walsh, Bangor\u000a      University: Gleeson M and Walsh N.

For\u000a      example, the regular monitoring of salivary IgA and nutritional and\u000a      lifestyle strategies to limit stress\u000a      and minimize infection risk are currently recommended by BASES, the\u000a      English Institute of Sport\u000a      (EIS) [5.1], the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) [5.2],\u000a      the European College of Sport Science\u000a      (ECSS) and the International Society of Exercise and Immunology (ISEI).\u000a      Gleeson's guidelines\u000a      were adopted by the recent programme of infection prevention strategies\u000a      that were developed in\u000a      2011-2012 by a medic working for UK Sport\/EIS [5.3]. Thus, the\u000a      research has both wide reach to\u000a      applied sport scientists, athletes and coaches and significance by\u000a      altering nutrition and monitoring\u000a      practices leading to reduced infection risk for athletes.\u000a    The Loughborough University-based research 2008-2013 has led to an\u000a      appreciation of the\u000a      importance of monitoring salivary IgA as a non-invasive marker of immune\u000a      function and predictor\u000a      of illness risk in athletes and the monitoring of salivary cortisol and\u000a      testosterone as hormonal\u000a      markers of stress [5.4] in both able and spinal cord injured\u000a      athletes. With Gleeson's assistance,\u000a      saliva monitoring has been used to assess training\/competition stress in\u000a      several professional\u000a      football and rugby clubs including Chelsea FC, Manchester City FC,\u000a      Manchester United FC [5.4],\u000a      Leicester City FC and Leicester Tigers RFC and the England rugby union\u000a      squad. Gleeson has\u000a      been instrumental in setting up these initiatives with these clubs in the\u000a      period 2004-2010, initially\u000a      by providing assistance with the analysis of saliva samples and guidance\u000a      on sample collection\u000a      methods and the timing of collections and the appropriate interpretation\u000a      of the results of the\u000a      analysis [5.4].\u000a    Loughborough University's research [3.1-3.3] on the most\u000a      effective nutritional interventions to\u000a      boost immunity and reduce infection risk is being applied in the world of\u000a      sport. For example,\u000a      probiotic supplementation is presently being used to support training\u000a      and\/or competition\u000a      performances by UK Athletics, British Cycling Federation, British Rowing,\u000a      British Canoe Union,\u000a      British Triathlon Federation, British Swimming, the Rugby Football Union,\u000a      the Welsh and Scottish\u000a      Rugby Football Unions, and other professional athletes [5.1, 5.2, 5.5].\u000a      The Lactobacillus probiotic\u000a      product that Gleeson's research demonstrated to be effective in reducing\u000a      incidence of URTI in\u000a      athletes was used by GB athletes in the lead up to and during the most\u000a      recent 2010\u000a      Commonwealth, and 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games following discussions\u000a      with the Head of\u000a      Performance Nutrition of the EIS [5.1] and via advice disseminated\u000a      to Sport Dietitians UK. The\u000a      Loughborough University research has also widened the market of probiotics\u000a      to the sporting\u000a      population [5.5, 5.6].\u000a    The research findings have been communicated in conversation with key\u000a      individuals within the EIS\u000a      [5.1, 5.3], AIS [5.2], International Olympic Committee\u000a      (IOC) etc and also through invited\u000a      presentations in the UK since 2008 (e.g. EIS Strength and Conditioning\u000a      conference; EIS Nutrition\u000a      conference; EIS Unwell Athlete workshop; UKA Coaches conference, Sport\u000a      Dietitians UK\u000a      Workshops, Royal Society of Medicine Symposia) and abroad (e.g. IOC\u000a      Offices, Switzerland;\u000a      Nestle Nutrition Institute Symposia in Zurich and Mallorca). Moreover, for\u000a      wider impact, Gleeson\u000a      occasionally contributes articles aimed at practicing sport scientists,\u000a      coaches and athletes (e.g.\u000a      The Sport and Exercise Scientist, Strength and Conditioning, UEFA\u000a        Direct) and lay people\u000a      (SportEX Health, Peak Performance, Men's Health, Runners World, Cycling\u000a        Weekly) as well as\u000a      disseminating translation of the research to the national press, radio and\u000a      television, both home and\u000a      abroad. This ensures that the research findings inform not only the elite,\u000a      but also the wider general\u000a      public who engage in regular exercise for fun and health.\u000a    The example outputs [3.1-3.6], along with other related outputs,\u000a      have contributed to the\u000a      development of nutritional support protocols and guidelines documents for\u000a      monitoring of athletes\u000a      as part of physiological support services to athletes [5.1-5.3].\u000a      These documents have been\u000a      published as review articles in academic journals (e.g. An ECSS\/ACSM\u000a      position statement on\u000a      prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the overtraining syndrome in European\u000a        Journal of Sport\u000a        Sciences 2013, two ISEI position statements on exercise and immune\u000a      function and maintaining\u000a      immune health in Exercise Immunology Review 2011, a BASES expert\u000a      statement in Journal of\u000a        Sports Sciences 2012). Loughborough University has developed a\u000a      strong reputation for high\u000a      quality original research in this area as evidenced by Gleeson's tenure as\u000a      vice president (2005-2007)\u000a      and president (2007-2009) of the ISEI.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of the research by Professor Gleeson on immune responses to\u000a      exercise and predictors\u000a      of infection risk in athletes has altered practice of sport science\u000a      support personnel, coaches and\u000a      athletes in several areas including: immunoendocrine monitoring\u000a      procedures, training prescription\u000a      and the use of nutritional interventions to reduce exercise stress\u000a      responses and minimize risk of\u000a      infection.

A series of studies that began in 2000 at\u000a      Loughborough University has\u000a      demonstrated that immune perturbations (e.g. depression of lymphocyte\u000a      cytokine production)\u000a      could be prevented by an appropriate dose (30-60 g\/hour) of carbohydrate\u000a      ingestion during\u000a      prolonged exercise via an attenuation of the exercise cortisol response [3.1]\u000a      and that chronic (daily\u000a      high dose vitamin C and E supplementation for 4 weeks), but not acute,\u000a      high-dose antioxidant\u000a      vitamin supplementation could also reduce the cortisol response to\u000a      exercise and so reduce the\u000a      inhibitory effect of exercise on some aspects of immune function [3.2].\u000a      Further studies initiated in\u000a      2009 at Loughborough University have established that regular ingestion of\u000a      Lactobacillus\u000a      probiotics can reduce common cold or upper respiratory tract infection\u000a      (URTI) risk in athletes; for\u000a      example, the paper published in 2011 [3.3] described the first\u000a      study to show that daily ingestion of\u000a      a probiotic supplement could reduce respiratory infection risk in a large\u000a      student cohort of\u000a      endurance athletes and games players.\u000a    Research at Loughborough University has also established the value of\u000a      immunoendocrine\u000a      monitoring as a practical tool to identify athletes who are not responding\u000a      well to stress [3.4, 3.5]\u000a      and are therefore at an increased risk of infection. For example, a study\u000a      on Americas Cup\u000a      yachtsmen in 2008 (with Dr Jonathan Folland, senior lecturer, 2004-2013),\u000a      established that weekly\u000a      measurement of salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) was a good predictor of\u000a      URTI risk [3.4]. Falls in\u000a      salivary IgA of 40% or more below normal healthy baseline concentration\u000a      indicated a one in two\u000a      chance of contracting an URTI within 3 weeks. These findings have\u000a      important implications for\u000a      athletes and coaches in identifying periods of high URTI risk. Other\u000a      studies since 2008 have\u000a      established which aspects of altered immune function predispose an athlete\u000a      to URTI and predict\u000a      illness risk. For example, papers published in 2011 and 2012 [3.5,\u000a        3.6] showed that illness-prone\u000a      athletes had lower salivary IgA secretion and a higher anti-inflammatory\u000a      cytokine production to\u000a      antigen challenge than athletes who remained illness-free during 4 months\u000a      of winter training, thus\u000a      establishing two markers that can be used to evaluate infection risk in\u000a      athletes. Furthermore, both\u000a      anti-inflammatory cytokine production to antigen challenge and infection\u000a      incidence were higher in\u000a      athletes with high training loads compared with athletes who had\u000a      low-moderate training loads.\u000a    Gleeson has published over 60 relevant papers since 2000 with an H-index\u000a      of 36. The six\u000a      exemplar research outputs listed in section 3 are separated into: (A)\u000a      those which changed practice\u000a      in elite sport by providing evidence for the potential benefit of certain\u000a      practical or nutritional\u000a      interventions to minimize immune impairment and infection risk and (B)\u000a      those focusing on\u000a      advancing sports science immunoendocrine monitoring procedures.

Early\u000d\u000a      research into this\u000d\u000a      problem focused almost exclusively on female victims. Hartill's work,\u000d\u000a      however, addressed the\u000d\u000a      problem of the sexual abuse of boys in sport. In addition, Hartill (Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer at Edge Hill since\u000d\u000a      30\/10\/00) and Prescott (Senior Lecturer at Edge Hill University\u000d\u000a      01.01.01-31.08.12) have\u000d\u000a      conducted research into the UK's response to sexual (and other forms of)\u000d\u000a      child abuse in sport\u000d\u000a      through work with the British Rugby Football League (RFL) (Hartill, 2012,\u000d\u000a      Hartill and Prescott,\u000d\u000a      2007). The underpinning research was undertaken from 2001 onwards.\u000d\u000a    Hartill's research represented the first investigation into the sexual\u000d\u000a      abuse of male children\u000d\u000a      within sport. The research generated life stories of men who had been\u000d\u000a      sexually abused as children\u000d\u000a      within a sport context and showed that the cultures of male-sport\u000d\u000a      (notoriously closed\u000d\u000a      environments) were frequently conducive to the sexual abuse of boys\u000d\u000a      (Hartill, 2009, 2013). These\u000d\u000a      conclusions have been reinforced by the steadily increasing number of male\u000d\u000a      athletes disclosing\u000d\u000a      childhood sexual victimization by coaches and others in positions of trust\u000d\u000a      within sport since Hartill\u000d\u000a      began publishing on this issue. In particular, it offered an original\u000d\u000a      sociological perspective on child\u000d\u000a      sexual abuse in sport beyond dominant pathological approaches which fail\u000d\u000a      to consider adequately\u000d\u000a      the socio-cultural antecedents of sexual violence.\u000d\u000a    The research relationship between EHU and the RFL was initiated in 2001\u000d\u000a      as the RFL began\u000d\u000a      the process of producing its first child protection policy and procedures.\u000d\u000a      The Chief Executive\u000d\u000a      Officer for BARLA (British Amateur Rugby League Association) invited\u000d\u000a      Hartill to join the Child\u000d\u000a      Protection in Rugby League Working Group. As in other UK sport governing\u000d\u000a      bodies, there was no\u000d\u000a      intention to monitor or evaluate the implementation of the policy.\u000d\u000a      However, EHU has now produced\u000d\u000a      three studies for the RFL in relation to its approach to child protection\u000d\u000a      and safeguarding (Hartill\u000d\u000a      and Prescott, 2002, 2007; Prescott and Hartill, 2012). This research\u000d\u000a      provided specific information\u000d\u000a      on where the key challenges lay in relation to the RFL's approach to\u000d\u000a      safeguarding and provided\u000d\u000a      guidance and support as it established and implemented its child\u000d\u000a      protection policy and procedures.\u000d\u000a    From a total population of 205 UK clubs, a postal survey elicited a 37%\u000d\u000a      (75 clubs) response. The\u000d\u000a      research (Hartill and Prescott, 2007) found that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      15 per cent (n=11) of responding clubs had not designated a `club\u000d\u000a        child protection officer'\u000d\u000a        despite the requirement to do so within the RFL policy;\u000d\u000a      over a fifth (n=16) of clubs had not presented the policy and\u000d\u000a        procedures to their members\u000d\u000a        12 months after the launch of the policy;\u000d\u000a      where the policy was presented, it tended to be designated a\u000d\u000a        low-priority status;\u000d\u000a      children and young people were not included within the development of\u000d\u000a        the child protection\u000d\u000a        policy and procedures, nor the implementation process;\u000d\u000a      two-thirds (n=48) of respondents stated the policy had a positive\u000d\u000a        impact on their club, a\u000d\u000a        fifth (n=15) stated it had no impact, and 7 per cent (n=5) gave a\u000d\u000a        negative response to the\u000d\u000a        child protection policy.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43783","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The following impacts arose between January 2008 and July 2013.\u000d\u000a    1) Changing practice by sports scientists and sports medicine\u000d\u000a      practitioners in the consideration of fatigue as an aetiological risk\u000d\u000a      factor for injury; highlighting the influence of fatigue on markers of\u000d\u000a      injury, and in conducting musculoskeletal profiling and\/or implementing\u000d\u000a      injury prevention strategies post-exercise. Evidence-based-practice is\u000d\u000a      paramount to practitioners across a number of user groups, to include\u000d\u000a      sports scientists, physiotherapists, and medics. This change in practice\u000d\u000a      has been evident in both clinical settings and professional football, as\u000d\u000a      detailed below (KF 1-4).\u000d\u000a    Clinical Practice: Physiotherapists and medical practitioners have\u000d\u000a      amended practice to acknowledge the influence of fatigue as an\u000d\u000a      aetiological factor for injury. In 2013, Greig was invited by IPRS\u000d\u000a      Mediquipe to deliver a key-note presentation entitled \"Fatigue and\u000d\u000a      isokinetics in football\" to a delegation including clinicians,\u000d\u000a      physiotherapists, sports scientists and practitioners from elite sport.\u000d\u000a      Physiotherapists and clinicians were subsequently given the opportunity to\u000d\u000a      discuss the practical implications of fatigue profiling with Greig and the\u000d\u000a      distributors of the isokinetic dynamometer used in the research.\u000d\u000a      Isokinetic profiles are typically conducted at rest. Greig's research has\u000d\u000a      highlighted a 20% deficit post-fatigue, and clinically this magnitude of\u000d\u000a      change would be \"red-flagged\" for intervention. Thus medical practitioners\u000d\u000a      from private health institutions and elite sport have expanded the scope\u000d\u000a      of isokinetic profiling to consider fatigue (Sources 1 and 2, Section 5).\u000d\u000a      The most contemporary version of the isokinetic dynamometer, Biodex System\u000d\u000a      4, has recently been amended to add a fatigue component in the Biofeedback\u000d\u000a      mode. This component has the ability to enable the clinician to select the\u000d\u000a      desired percentage of fatigue (Source 1. Section 5).\u000d\u000a    Professional Football: Given the sport-specific focus of the research to\u000d\u000a      date, the change in practice has been most evident in football. Over the\u000d\u000a      last 6 years Greig has worked with the Football Association to provide\u000d\u000a      sports science support to the development squads, primarily the U16 and\u000d\u000a      U19 England teams. His research has influenced his own practice as a\u000d\u000a      sports scientist. Players benefit from direct input in post-exercise\u000d\u000a      prehabilitation programmes. As a sports scientist with the England squads\u000d\u000a      Greig has worked with a physiotherapist, team Doctor, and coaching staff.\u000d\u000a      These colleagues assist in the delivery of the interventions and are\u000d\u000a      thereby also attaining new skills. Indirectly, through advisory groups and\u000d\u000a      conference attendance, sports scientists at professional clubs are\u000d\u000a      provided with professional development by the Football Association (Source\u000d\u000a      4, Section 5).\u000d\u000a    2) Injury prevention policy\u000d\u000a    This body of research undertaken by Greig considers the influence of\u000d\u000a      fatigue as a biomechanical, rather than physiological, concern when\u000d\u000a      evaluating injury risk and has been cited recently in the injury audit\u000d\u000a      reports produced by UEFA (Risk Factors for Lower Extremity Muscle Injury\u000d\u000a      in Professional Soccer: The UEFA Injury Study.

The cumulative impact of sport-specific\u000d\u000a      exposure over a career in elite sport is also being investigated, with\u000d\u000a      implications for the care and rehabilitation of retired players. In a\u000d\u000a      follow-up of the UEFA Champions League study, the impact of cumulative\u000d\u000a      fatigue was considered in relation to fixture congestion (Source 5). The\u000d\u000a      UEFA recommendation was to consider the design of match schedules to\u000d\u000a      ensure recovery between games and minimise the impact of fatigue on\u000d\u000a      injury. PhD work currently on-going under the supervision of Greig is\u000d\u000a      considering the replication of tournament demands, using repeated bouts of\u000d\u000a      the laboratory protocol.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research has been evident in a change of practice\u000d\u000a      regarding the consideration of fatigue in musculoskeletal profiling, and\u000d\u000a      as an aetiological risk factor for injury.

He has been employed continuously throughout\u000d\u000a      the assessment period and is currently a Reader in Sport and Exercise\u000d\u000a      Biomechanics in the Department of Sport and Physical Activity. The\u000d\u000a      underpinning research was undertaken at Edge Hill between 2008 and 2010.\u000d\u000a    Injury audits by English and European football governing bodies have\u000d\u000a      highlighted fatigue as a risk factor for injury in professional football.\u000d\u000a      The interpretation is consistently a lack of physiological conditioning.\u000d\u000a      This case study is based on a biomechanical consideration of fatigue as an\u000d\u000a      aetiological risk factor.\u000d\u000a    Greig has developed a treadmill representation of the physical demands of\u000d\u000a      match-play, showing that the mechanical response to soccer-specific\u000d\u000a      exercise mirrors the epidemiological pattern of injury incidence. This\u000d\u000a      exercise model has been used to conduct a series of studies investigating\u000d\u000a      the influence of fatigue on biomechanical markers of injury.\u000d\u000a    Key Finding 1 (Output #1): Eccentric hamstring strength (as measured\u000d\u000a      using isokinetic dynamometry) is impaired with soccer-specific fatigue,\u000d\u000a      particularly at high speeds. The time history of changes in hamstring\u000d\u000a      strength is in line with the incidence and mechanism of hamstring strain\u000d\u000a      injury.\u000d\u000a    Key Finding 2 (Output #2): Acknowledging that isokinetic strength has\u000d\u000a      limited kinesiological relation to soccer-specific activities, a kinematic\u000d\u000a      analysis of agility sprinting was conducted using the same fatigue\u000d\u000a      protocol. Agility, and in particular cutting, is both a high risk movement\u000d\u000a      and functionally relevant to the observed changes in hamstring strength. A\u000d\u000a      fatigue effect was evident in both knee flexion and varus, increasing the\u000d\u000a      risk of injury.\u000d\u000a    The consideration of fatigue as a risk factor for injury was continued\u000d\u000a      next by a PhD student (Small) supervised by Greig. This body of work\u000d\u000a      further developed the exercise model of fatigue by creating a free-running\u000d\u000a      protocol.\u000d\u000a    Key Finding 3 (Output #3): Acknowledging the limitations of treadmill\u000d\u000a      protocols in replicating the functional activities inherent in soccer, a\u000d\u000a      free-running protocol is presented which replicates the physical demands\u000d\u000a      of match-play. Sprinting is a primary non-contact injury mechanism, and\u000d\u000a      functionally related to hamstring strain injury which is a primary injury\u000d\u000a      type. This study showed that fatigue induced technical changes in\u000d\u000a      sprinting technique, with implications for injury.\u000d\u000a    Key Finding 4 (Output #4): The free-running protocol was shown to produce\u000d\u000a      a similar magnitude decrease in eccentric hamstring strength as the\u000d\u000a      treadmill protocol used previously. Again the changes in eccentric\u000d\u000a      hamstring strength mirror epidemiological observations of injury\u000d\u000a      incidence. The isokinetic dynamometry analysis was extended to consider\u000d\u000a      functional changes in the strength-angle relationship, given the observed\u000d\u000a      changes in running techniques. Fatigue was shown to influence both peak\u000d\u000a      strength, and the angle of peak strength.\u000d\u000a    Research into fatigue as an aetiological factor for injury has continued,\u000d\u000a      with Greig developing a body of work considering varied injury mechanisms.\u000d\u000a      The consideration of fatigue has evolved from treadmill to free-running,\u000d\u000a      and subsequently to repeated trials to reflect the impact of fixture\u000d\u000a      congestion on the modern professional. PhD students currently supervised\u000d\u000a      by Greig are investigating the physical response to soccer-specific\u000d\u000a      exercise in the heat (as a precursor to World Cups in Rio and Qatar), and\u000d\u000a      the development of injury prevention strategies to develop \"fatigability\".\u000d\u000a      Injury epidemiology in similar intermittent team sports (supervised by\u000d\u000a      Greig at M-Level) is being used to develop a research strategy considering\u000d\u000a      whether a change in policy might be more effective than any\u000d\u000a      musculo-skeletal intervention.

Cunningham and Hale's early work generated the\u000a      first data quantifying\u000a      the physical demands placed upon elite sailors during training and\u000a      simulated competition, from\u000a      which a novel sailing ergometer was developed, which has been used in\u000a      later sailing research and\u000a      support work.\u000a    To support the introduction and development of the evidenced based\u000a      training practices; regular\u000a      physiological monitoring of ~50-100 Youth, Podium Potential and Podium\u000a      squad sailors per year\u000a      was conducted annually in the UC laboratories (1995-2010) (~150-300 in the\u000a      REF period).

Cunningham's contribution to this guide was a key factor\u000a      in Concept2, one of the\u000a      world's leading rowing machine manufacturer and retailers, becoming the\u000a      RYA's preferred supplier\u000a      of rowing ergometers at no cost to the RYA (up to 20 units in any year).\u000a    This guidance is underpinned by Cunningham's research and is the first\u000a      evidenced based training\u000a      guidelines using rowing ergometers to simulate the cardiorespiratory and\u000a      neuromuscular demands\u000a      of sailing. The guide has been written for elite and recreational sailors,\u000a      including those in younger\u000a      and older age categories. Individual heart rate zones are used to\u000a      prescribe training intensity.\u000a      Specific training programmes were devised for all of the Olympic sailing\u000a      classes (i.e. different\u000a      dinghys and sailboards), with five incremental levels of application,\u000a      ensuring the training could be\u000a      used by athletes in the Youth, Podium Potential and Podium squads.\u000a    iii. Performance gains for individuals and teams at the elite and\u000a        recreational level.\u000a    The development of the collaborative RYA and UC research and applied\u000a      sports science support\u000a      programmes over the past three decades have paralleled the increase in\u000a      funding for both elite\u000a      sailors and their support teams (including sports science and medicine).\u000a      It is therefore difficult to\u000a      quantify the exact impact that the aforementioned research and support\u000a      programmes have had on\u000a      athletes' success. However, it is notable that Team GB's sailors were at\u000a      the top of the medal tables\u000a      at the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games and 3rd in 2012; of\u000a      particular note were the 3 gold\u000a      medals in 2008 achieved for single-handed sailing, the focus of\u000a      Cunningham's research work. Iain\u000a      Percy (Double Olympic champion) provides testament to the significant\u000a      contribution of\u000a      Cunningham's sports science support work in helping the team to win medals\u000a      (see section 5,\u000a      source 8).\u000a    In the 12 months building up to 2008 Olympic Games (opened 8\/8\/2008) and\u000a      during the\u000a      competition period (i.e. after 1\/1\/2008 and within the REF period), new\u000a      haematological and\u000a      biochemical analysis techniques were developed (see Lewis et al.\u000a      2009 in section 3) and used with\u000a      all 18 of the British Sailing Team to rapidly identify markers of\u000a      increased illness risk. This enabled\u000a      training and nutritional interventions to be targeted to reduce illness,\u000a      improve training progression\u000a      and safely and effectively lose weight (see section 5, source 8). The\u000a      wider impact of the\u000a      development of these techniques has not been documented but there are\u000a      clear applications to the\u000a      wider sporting community.\u000a    iv. The transfer of skills and knowledge to other elite sport\u000a        organisations and teams\u000a    The early work of Cunningham and Hale set the foundation on which a more\u000a      established sports\u000a      science and medicine team has now developed, they are able to draw on\u000a      novel research and\u000a      support techniques developed in other disciplines to inform their own best\u000a      practice. In turn the RYA\u000a      and UC are using this knowledge to continue to drive and refine their own\u000a      research and support\u000a      programme including an on-going PhD research programme and the continuing\u000a      monitoring and\u000a      support to maintain the British Sailing Team's world class performance.\u000a      The progression of\u000a      Cunningham to the role of as Head of Sport Science and Medicine in Team\u000a      Artemis (America's\u000a      Cup Team)4, Campbell and Mullan to more senior roles has led to\u000a      wider dissemination and impact\u000a      of the knowledge and skills form their roles in the RYA and UC.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A 20 year collaborative programme of research and physiological\u000a      monitoring between the Royal\u000a      Yachting Association (RYA) and the University of Chichester (UC) has\u000a      significantly impacted upon\u000a      training and competitive strategies adopted by the RYA to maintain world\u000a      class sailing performance\u000a      within the REF period.

Before 1994 there was very\u000a      limited physiological\u000a      data documenting the physical demands of competitive dingy and\u000a      boardsailing and as such\u000a      training was not underpinned by an empirical evidence base. Cunningham and\u000a      Hale's early\u000a      research addressed this shortfall and documented the physical demands\u000a      placed upon elite athletes\u000a      during competitive sailing, culminating in the development of novel\u000a      laboratory simulations where\u000a      the cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular responses could be studied\u000a      (Buchanan et al. 1996,\u000a      Cunningham et al. 1995, 1998, Cunningham &amp; Hale 2007). Much of\u000a      the research undertaken in the\u000a      earlier part of this period formed Dr Cunningham's PhD (undertaken\u000a      part-time as a staff candidate)\u000a      entitled `The physiological demands of elite single-handed dinghy\u000a        sailing' (awarded in 2004). Due\u000a      to the sensitive nature of the research, in terms of competitive advantage\u000a      for the British Sailing\u000a      Team, a five-year publication embargo was imposed.\u000a    These studies and the baseline data became a foundation for the\u000a      continuing development of\u000a      evidenced based training and a sports science support programme for Youth,\u000a      Podium Potential\u000a      and Podium squads.\u000a    Between 2005 and 2011 Adrian Campbell (UC Research Associate) and Paul\u000a      Mullan (English\u000a      Institute of Sport (EIS) Physiologist) worked at UC under Cunningham's\u000a      supervision expanding the\u000a      RYA's research and support programme. Although Prof Hale retired in 2004\u000a      he continued to\u000a      contribute to the programme as Emeritus Professor of UC. Dr Rosemary Dyson\u000a      another member of\u000a      the UC academic staff also undertook research in to the physical demands\u000a      of boardsailing. During\u000a      this period, alongside the monitoring and evaluation that had now become a\u000a      routine part RYA\u000a      training and preparation for competition, Cunningham, Campbell, Mullan and\u000a      UC researchers\u000a      conducted research projects to investigate novel strategies to enhance\u000a      performance. Published\u000a      studies include the investigation into the incidence of injuries in elite\u000a      and recreational windsurfers\u000a      (Dyson et al. 2006); and the development of haematological tests\u000a      to monitor risks of overtraining\u000a      and illness (Lewis et al. 2009). Unpublished research included an\u000a      evaluation of the impact of cool\u000a      vests on physical performance in hot and humid environments which\u000a      influenced competitive\u000a      strategies prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\u000a    In 2011 Cunningham left his post with the RYA (and left employment of the\u000a      University) to take up a\u000a      full time position as Head of Sport Science and Medicine for the Artemis\u000a      America's Cup Team and\u000a      Campbell moved to take up the role of Performance Scientist at the\u000a      Scottish Institute of Sport.\u000a      Mullan was then appointed as Head of Sports Science and Medicine at the\u000a      RYA. Two new\u000a      research associates (Dr David Macutkiewicz &amp; Tim Jones) were employed\u000a      by UC in 2011 to work\u000a      alongside Mullan and they now play an integral part in developing and\u000a      implementing the RYA's\u000a      research and evidenced based support programme.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43831","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research carried out by Dr Myers and high-speed craft (HSC) research\u000d\u000a      team (Professor\u000d\u000a      McMorris, Drs Dyson, Dobbins, University of Chichester (UoC); Dr Tom\u000d\u000a      Gunston, SIG-SCP;\u000d\u000a      Drs Sharon Holmes, Stuart King, QinetiQ Ltd), has achieved significant\u000d\u000a      impact across the\u000d\u000a      globe for individuals and organisations that use high speed marine craft.\u000d\u000a      The principal\u000d\u000a      pathways for impact are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Uptake of research by civil and military organisations leading to\u000d\u000a        change in guidelines\u000d\u000a        and\/or working practices including procurement and training;\u000d\u000a      Launch of commercial ventures drawing on the findings of the research;\u000d\u000a      Development and delivery of training materials based on outcomes from\u000d\u000a        the research\u000d\u000a        delivered to users\/operators of high speed craft;\u000d\u000a      Improved boat operative experience and performance through reduced\u000d\u000a        exposure to\u000d\u000a        vibration and shock resulting from better designed craft and\/or working\u000d\u000a        practices.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Creation and revision of international standards and guidance\u000d\u000a      Longer-term impact stemming from the UoC work arises from High Speed Craft\u000d\u000a      Human\u000d\u000a      Factors Engineering Design Guide written by Dobbins with two co-authors\u000d\u000a      from industry\u000d\u000a      (Ergonomist and Naval Architect) (ABCD-TR-08-01; 2008).

The programme was\u000d\u000a      driven by\u000d\u000a      widespread anecdotal reports of fatigue following transits in HSC. A\u000d\u000a      secondary driver was the\u000d\u000a      EU Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive, for which 8-hour action and\u000d\u000a      limit values are\u000d\u000a      mandated, using whole-body vibration (WBV) data, recorded primarily on\u000d\u000a      terrestrial vehicles.\u000d\u000a      Prior to the research programme, no representative data existed describing\u000d\u000a      either the HSC\u000d\u000a      environment, or its effect in the physical and cognitive performance of\u000d\u000a      passengers\/crew.\u000d\u000a      Acceleration data collected in open rigid inflatable boats (RIB)\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that WBV and\u000d\u000a      shock\/impact levels were far in excess of those experienced in any other\u000d\u000a      form of transport and\u000d\u000a      the EU Limit Value was often exceeded within minutes of normal operation.\u000d\u000a      These data\u000d\u000a      suggested that the EU mandated values and the current WBV evaluation\u000d\u000a      standard (ISO 2631-5:2004)\u000d\u000a      were incompatible with HSC operations and resulted in an international\u000d\u000a      committee\u000d\u000a      being formed to revise the latter, on which Dr Gunston represents the UK.\u000d\u000a    The acceleration data confirmed it was not possible to simulate HSC\u000d\u000a      conditions, which\u000d\u000a      necessitated the development of methodologies and equipment for sea-based\u000d\u000a      trials to reliably\u000d\u000a      assess their effect on physical and cognitive performance. It was also\u000d\u000a      necessary to use\u000d\u000a      participants for who HSC transits followed by high intensity activity\u000d\u000a      formed part of their role.\u000d\u000a      Over 100 specialised military personnel participated in 14 trials\u000d\u000a      conducted in Poole, Plymouth,\u000d\u000a      Faslane and Panama City covering a range of sea conditions. These trials\u000d\u000a      were supported\u000d\u000a      through extensive in-kind support (MOD, UK Special Forces, Royal Marines)\u000d\u000a      covering\u000d\u000a      personnel and equipment. Initial trials conducted with the Special Forces\u000d\u000a      team responsible for\u000d\u000a      UK maritime security, demonstrated reduced running performance (-15%),\u000d\u000a      following 2-hour\u000d\u000a      high-speed RIB transits in calm\/moderate seas. This confirmed the\u000d\u000a      importance of the issue\u000d\u000a      and the need to identify the underlying causes and ways to mitigate it.\u000d\u000a      Further sea-trials were\u000d\u000a      conducted with a Royal Marine maritime protection unit over a range of sea\u000d\u000a      conditions. These\u000d\u000a      reported reduced physical performance post-transit of 20-25%. Measurements\u000d\u000a      were also made\u000d\u000a      of muscle activity and metabolic rate during sea-transits, which indicated\u000d\u000a      low aerobic demand,\u000d\u000a      but high muscle activity, however both were reduced when a commercial\u000d\u000a      suspension seat was\u000d\u000a      used.

NAI have filed and been granted\u000a      filed patents worldwide (US, EU, China, Canada, Japan) based on Harris'\u000a      beta-alanine work to create the `beta-alanine patent estate' (see http:\/\/www.carnosyn.com\/about).\u000a      In particular, Harris' discovery that the presence of paraesthesia\u000a      (tingling sensation in the skin) occurred with beta-alanine supplemented\u000a      in bolus form, led to the development and manufacture of slow-release\u000a      beta-alanine capsules by NAI, these capsules minimizing or preventing\u000a      paraesthesia effects. Thus in 2012, the slow-release beta-alanine capsules\u000a      were patented by NAI under the CarnoSyn&#174; registered trademark (U.S. Patent\u000a      No. 8,129,422 entitled \"Methods and compositions for increasing the\u000a      anaerobic working capacity in tissues.\"). Harris is named as one of the\u000a      two inventors on this patent (other NAI patents also name Harris as sole\u000a      or joint inventor) which cites more than 30 of Harris' publications within\u000a      the period he was employed at Chichester (including all of those listed\u000a      under section 3). Furthermore, during fiscal year 2011, NAI expanded the\u000a      beta-alanine licensing programs through the execution of a supply\u000a      agreement with Nestle Nutrition (Nestle) and a license and supply\u000a      agreement with Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). From the start of fiscal year\u000a      2009, NAI revenues with the sale and licences of beta-alanine has grown\u000a      from $515.000 to $4.8 million in the fiscal year 2013. During fiscal year\u000a      2013, NAI issued seven new beta-alanine patents also based on Harris' work\u000a      whilst at Chichester bringing the number of NAI patents possessed by June\u000a      2013 to twenty-five for beta-alanine and five for sustained released\u000a      beta-alanine. Multiple WO, US, CN and one KR filed patents returned from\u000a      the WIPO Patentscope database that are beta-alanine related and cite\u000a      Harris as the inventor; these patents also establish the deep connection\u000a      between Roger Harris and NAI Inc.\u000a    Many sports nutrition companies (e.g. UK-based Maximuscle, the leading\u000a      European Sports Nutrition company, bought by GlaxoSmithKline for &#163;162\u000a      million), now provide beta-alanine as a single ingredient or incorporated\u000a      in a multi-ingredient product. Elite athletes use Maximuscle beta- alanine\u000a      (e.g. Welsh National Rugby Union (\"beta-alanine is used 4 weeks prior to\u000a      and for duration of campaigns\") and British Weight Lifting). It is quite\u000a      rare for elite athletes to share `secrets' during interview about their\u000a      nutritional intake, however, Dai Green, a 400 m hurdles World Champion\u000a      acknowledged taking beta-alanine. One can only speculate about the impact\u000a      of such revelation by a World Champion. Confirmation of the reach and\u000a      significance of Harris' work comes through the Australian Institute of\u000a      Sport (AIS) Sports Supplement Program in its 2012 factsheet on\u000a      beta-alanine supplementation. This factsheet targets to inform elite and\u000a      amateur athletes, their coaches and support organisations and arises from\u000a      \"a cutting-edge program initiated in 2000 following a major review of\u000a        supplement practices by AIS athletes and their related issues [it] is\u000a        designed to provide world's best practice in the research, education and\u000a        provision of sports foods and supplements for AIS athletes and coaches\".\u000a    Professor Harris has been an advocate for evidence based sports nutrition\u000a      for many years. Harris and co-workers were invited to contribute to the\u000a      BBC TV series called \"The Truth about Food\" and was screened on BBC2 in\u000a      February 2007. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the\u000a      International Society of Sports Nutrition in 2011 for outstanding\u000a      contributions to the sciences of sports nutrition. He routinely\u000a      contributes to public and scientific debate, for example, evidence on\u000a      beta-alanine supplementation was presented by Harris at the 76th\u000a      Nestl&#233; Nutrition Institute at its scientific workshop in Oxford (UK) on 15\u000a      August 2012 during the London Olympic Games, a workshop in which a\u000a      multidisciplinary group of scientists, athletes, and coaches discussed the\u000a      latest scientific evidence on the effectiveness of micronutrients and\u000a      exercise performance.

As\u000a      such, the optimal dose of beta-alanine supplementation was established by\u000a      this study and became, in part through collaborative endeavour, the\u000a      adopted beta-alanine supplementation protocol by UK (Nottingham Trent\u000a      University) and non-UK based research groups (e.g. University of Oklahoma,\u000a      USA; University of S&#227;o Paulo, Brasil; Ghent University, Belgium).\u000a      Subsequent work, directed by Harris (Hill et al., 2007) confirmed an\u000a      effect on high intensity cycling performance by 4 week of beta-alanine\u000a      supplementation. Hill et al (2007) also examined the effect of\u000a      beta-alanine supplementation over a 10 week period and showed that a\u000a      larger increase in carnosine content in both slow- and fast-twitch muscle\u000a      fibres was associated with increased high-intensity cycling performance.\u000a      This was the first study (Hill et al., 2007) that established the impact\u000a      of augmented carnosine content on high-intensity exercise. Further studies\u000a      by Harris and co-workers (Kendrick et al., 2008, 2009) found 1). no\u000a      evidence that a combination of isokinetic training and beta-alanine\u000a      supplementation for 4 weeks would result in higher carnosine content, and\u000a      2). that 10 weeks of resistance training did enhance carnosine content,\u000a      underpinning the view that the beta-alanine supplementation is key for\u000a      augmenting carnosine content. Since leaving Chichester, co-worker Sale\u000a      continued to build on the landmark studies undertaken at Chichester. For\u000a      example, work on the effect of beta-alanine supplementation for\u000a      high-intensity cycling capacity (Sale et al., 2011), endurance of\u000a      sustained isometric contractions of knee extensors (Sale et al., 2012),\u000a      high-intensity swimming performance (De Salles Painelli et al., 2013),\u000a      high-intensity intermittent upper-body performance in judo and jiu-jitsu\u000a      competitors (Tobias et al., 2013) and 2000m rowing performance (Hobson et\u000a      al., 2013). Although the main focus of Harris and co-workers was initially\u000a      on the ergogenic effects on sport performance, they were able to show\u000a      elevated carnosine content in resistance-trained body builders (Tallon et\u000a      al., 2005), and lower carnosine content in older subjects (Tallon et al.,\u000a      2007). Subsequent work in older subjects showed effects of beta-alanine\u000a      supplementation on performance with potential implications for activities\u000a      of daily living and prevention of falls (Stout et al., 2008). A review by\u000a      the British Journal of Sports Medicine (co-authored by Harris), in a\u000a      prominent series on nutritional supplements, covered beta- alanine as a\u000a      performance enhancing aid (Castell et al., 2010).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43969","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The extensive programme of research undertaken at Essex has demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that Green Exercise can yield benefits both to health and well-being.\u000d\u000a      These findings have significant implications, and through proactive\u000d\u000a      dissemination and via externally commissioned projects, Essex's research\u000d\u000a      has had an impact on the policies and practices of a number of health and\u000d\u000a      environmental organisations. It has also informed a consumer engagement\u000d\u000a      campaign in the private sector.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Mind: For many years the British mental health charity\u000d\u000a      Mind has campaigned to enhance the use of alternative treatments to help\u000d\u000a      tackle the UK's growing problem of poor mental health. The charity\u000d\u000a      recognised that Green Exercise had the potential to not only offer a\u000d\u000a      cost-effective solution, but also to avoid the adverse side-effects often\u000d\u000a      associated with clinical treatments. Following the group's research to\u000d\u000a      explore the available benefits of Green Exercise to mental health\u000d\u000a      (specifically amongst vulnerable groups), Mind commissioned Essex to\u000d\u000a      undertake two Green Exercise studies in 2007. These studies found that\u000d\u000a      people experiencing mental health distress were frequently using physical\u000d\u000a      activities to help lift their mood, reduce stress, provide purpose and\u000d\u000a      meaning, and reduce vulnerability to depression. Furthermore, it was shown\u000d\u000a      that such activity helped develop motivation and self-esteem, and that\u000d\u000a      contact with other people was helping to reduce isolation, provide support\u000d\u000a      and improve social skills.\u000d\u000a    In recognition of their significance, Mind published the results of the\u000d\u000a      studies in the 2007 report Ecotherapy: The Green Agenda for Mental\u000d\u000a        Health. This called for the concepts of Green Exercise to be\u000d\u000a      considered amongst mainstream treatment options [see corroborating source\u000d\u000a      1]. A letter of support from Mind's Community Portfolio Manager details\u000d\u000a      how the report was then used to support a successful Big Lottery funding\u000d\u000a      bid, to develop the `Ecominds' grant programme [2]. Beginning in 2008,\u000d\u000a      this was a &#163;7.5M, five year initiative which facilitated 130 environmental\u000d\u000a      projects nationwide, promoting mental health via green activity engagement\u000d\u000a      [3]. Mind's Community Portfolio Manager explains how:\u000d\u000a    \"Ecominds projects help people living with mental health problems get\u000d\u000a      involved in green activities to improve confidence, self-esteem, and their\u000d\u000a      physical and mental health. Participants learn about exercise, healthy\u000d\u000a      eating, recycling and sustainable environments, whilst all the while\u000d\u000a      finding support and friendship, and gaining employment training. By\u000d\u000a      engaging with their local communities many projects are also transforming\u000d\u000a      derelict land and helping to break down the stigma of mental health. [...]\u000d\u000a      In summary, Ecominds projects are having a profound impact upon a\u000d\u000a      significant proportion of our population, and widespread health and\u000d\u000a      wellbeing benefits have been reported nationwide. Green Exercise\u000d\u000a      researchers at Essex played an important role in helping this outcome to\u000d\u000a      be achieved\".\u000d\u000a    Community Portfolio Manager, Mind\u000d\u000a    The extensive impact of Ecominds-funded projects, along with widespread\u000d\u000a      positive feedback from project participants, is also summarised in the\u000d\u000a      2013 report Ecominds Directory of Projects 2009-2013 [4]. Although\u000d\u000a      many Ecominds activities have now completed their original funded work,\u000d\u000a      most of the 130 projects are still providing some type of environmental\u000d\u000a      activity for participants, and many have successfully obtained new funds\u000d\u000a      to continue their activities [5]. Since the launch of Ecominds, Essex\u000d\u000a      researchers have also remained actively involved in the programme,\u000d\u000a      undertaking evaluation exercises [6].\u000d\u000a    Impact on environmental organisations: Green Exercise research has\u000d\u000a      also had an impact on environmental organisations. This has primarily been\u000d\u000a      through the use of research findings to inform organisational strategies\u000d\u000a      and communication with the public. For instance, having adopted the term\u000d\u000a      `Green Exercise' following Essex's early research in 2003, in 2012 Natural\u000d\u000a      England (NE) cited the Essex Dose of Nature paper in an\u000d\u000a      evidence-based information pack, highlighting why the natural environment\u000d\u000a      should form an integral part of public health [7]. Essex's work has also\u000d\u000a      informed Natural England's own research strategies. For example, in 2010\u000d\u000a      Essex research was cited in a presentation by NE's strategic health\u000d\u000a      advisor at a LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming) UK event [8]. Essex\u000d\u000a      staff are also regularly invited to contribute to strategic research\u000d\u000a      meetings at NE through the `Outdoors for All' advisory group. Finally,\u000d\u000a      Natural England drew upon Essex's Green Exercise research in their\u000d\u000a      response to the 2011 Office for National Statistics consultation on how\u000d\u000a      national well-being should be measured [9], to argue that proximity to\u000d\u000a      nature is a significant determinant of health and well-being.\u000d\u000a    Impact in the private sector: In 2012 the sports bra manufacturer\u000d\u000a      Shock Absorber launched a consumer engagement campaign entitled `Get Out\u000d\u000a      There' (GOT), to promote the benefits of exercising outdoors. Based on her\u000d\u000a      extensive Green Exercise research at Essex, Dr Barton was asked to act as\u000d\u000a      spokesperson and ambassador for the campaign. The campaign drew directly\u000d\u000a      upon Essex's research, for instance, by promoting the findings that\u000d\u000a      exercising outdoors can significantly boost mood and self-esteem. The GOT\u000d\u000a      campaign was facilitated by the public relations company Iris PR, which\u000d\u000a      reported the positive outcomes and widespread coverage that the campaign\u000d\u000a      generated. This included 35 pieces of online coverage and 8 pieces of\u000d\u000a      print coverage, contributing to over 40% more media deliverables than were\u000d\u000a      originally targeted by the campaign. It is clear from the campaign\u000d\u000a      evaluation that Barton's contribution to the project was an important\u000d\u000a      factor in securing such widespread coverage, for example, by undertaking\u000d\u000a      interviews with the Daily Telegraph and BBC Radio Nottingham [10, see\u000d\u000a      pages 42, 69].\u000d\u000a    Finally, in a wider context and independently of the GOT campaign, it\u000d\u000a      should be noted that the Essex group's public engagement and dissemination\u000d\u000a      activities have been significant in heightening awareness and raising the\u000d\u000a      public profile of Green Exercise research. Notably, within the REF2014\u000d\u000a      impact period, Essex research has featured on NHS Choices (the UK's\u000d\u000a      largest health website) which, in 2010, highlighted the research showing\u000d\u000a      that just five minutes of Green Exercise can boost mental health [11]. The\u000d\u000a      same piece of research was drawn upon by the BBC [12], whose coverage has\u000d\u000a      also featured Essex on a number of other occasions over the past five\u000d\u000a      years [13] [14].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The term `Green Exercise' was first coined at the University of Essex to\u000d\u000a      describe physical activity undertaken in `green' surroundings.

It is also widely recognised that contact with\u000d\u000a      the natural environment can have positive effects on mental well-being. In\u000d\u000a      2003, researchers at the University of Essex formally proposed the\u000d\u000a      synergistic benefits of adopting physical activity whilst at the same time\u000d\u000a      being directly exposed to nature. This concept was coined `Green Exercise'\u000d\u000a      (Pretty et al., 2003) and initiated a rigorous scientific research\u000d\u000a      programme. Combining expertise in sports science, physiology, psychology\u000d\u000a      and environmental sciences, this programme has demonstrated that Green\u000d\u000a      Exercise can yield benefits to both health and well-being and that,\u000d\u000a      additionally, it can increase the likelihood of participant understanding\u000d\u000a      of and care for nature.\u000d\u000a    Based in the School of Biological Sciences, the research has been led\u000d\u000a      primarily by Jules Pretty (Professor of Environment and Society), Dr Jo\u000d\u000a      Barton (n&#233;e Peacock, as Research Officer, Senior Research Officer and\u000d\u000a      Lecturer) and Dr Rachel Bragg (n&#233;e Hine, as Research Officer and Senior\u000d\u000a      Research Officer). More recently, significant contributions have also been\u000d\u000a      made by Drs Carly Wood, Valerie Gladwell, Dominic Micklewright, Gavin\u000d\u000a      Sandercock and Murray Griffin. The group's research has developed using\u000d\u000a      both laboratory- and field-based approaches. Initial laboratory studies,\u000d\u000a      starting in 2003, analysed the Green Exercise concept within a controlled\u000d\u000a      setting by comparing the health outcomes of viewing rural or urban scenes\u000d\u000a      whilst exercising on a treadmill. The researchers at Essex were the first\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary group to quantify a synergistic health benefit. This\u000d\u000a      research showed that exercising with green views improved self-esteem and\u000d\u000a      mood, and reduced mean arterial blood pressure much more than exercise\u000d\u000a      would alone, thus demonstrating the importance of the chosen exercise\u000d\u000a      environment (Pretty, 2004).\u000d\u000a    Complementing the laboratory-based studies, since 2004 the group have\u000d\u000a      conducted a number of field studies involving over 1,500 participants and\u000d\u000a      all externally funded by key stakeholders (see, for example, Pretty et\u000d\u000a      al., 2007). This has extended to also include evaluation of a variety of\u000d\u000a      nature-based projects at both community and national levels. Standardised\u000d\u000a      questionnaires were used to quantify changes in key mental health\u000d\u000a      parameters such as self-esteem and mood after participating in a range of\u000d\u000a      Green Exercise activities. This research shows that Green Exercise, across\u000d\u000a      all ranges of intensity, duration or green environmental setting can serve\u000d\u000a      to improve self-esteem, whilst reducing feelings of anger, tension and\u000d\u000a      depression. The health message stemming from this research has important\u000d\u000a      implications for the sedentary population, as it encourages a realistic\u000d\u000a      and achievable transition to an active lifestyle. Significantly, the\u000d\u000a      research also demonstrated that there are associated benefits available to\u000d\u000a      participants across a broad range of health and fitness statuses.\u000d\u000a    Researchers at Essex are internationally recognised for being the first\u000d\u000a      group to conceptualise a `dose of nature' for improving psychological\u000d\u000a      health. In 2010, a unique secondary multi-study analysis was used to\u000d\u000a      inform an optimal dose of Green Exercise according to activity type, and\u000d\u000a      environmental and participant characteristics. The concept of a dose of\u000d\u000a      nature suggests several questions relating to the activities (in terms of\u000d\u000a      the type, duration and intensity), types of green places (e.g. urban green\u000d\u000a      space, countryside, waterside, wilderness, woodlands) and participant\u000d\u000a      characteristics (age, sex, health status). The research established a\u000d\u000a      `dose-response' curve and showed that the greatest changes in self-esteem\u000d\u000a      and mood appear after the first five minutes of exercise, suggesting an\u000d\u000a      immediate mental health impact (Barton and Pretty, 2010). The publication\u000d\u000a      of this research stimulated a significant amount of interest. An editorial\u000d\u000a      commentary, which drew upon this and subsequent publications to summarise\u000d\u000a      `The Benefits of Being Green', appeared in the November 2012 issue of Environmental\u000d\u000a        Science and Technology (ES&amp;T). Referring to the 2010 `dose of\u000d\u000a      nature' publication, the commentary states that \"the paper was an instant\u000d\u000a      success &#8212; it was publicized widely and featured as one of the most\u000d\u000a      down-loaded articles of 2010 in ES&amp;T\".\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43971","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impacts arising from the manufacture of biomedical equipment:\u000a      Cooper's academic research on second derivative spectroscopy (Cooper et\u000a      al., 1998; Myers et al., 2005) informed the development of the InspectraTM\u000a\u0009  StO2 near infrared spectrometers produced by Hutchinson Technology\u000a      Inc.

Secondly, the letter notes how Cooper's\u000a      research also contributed to device validation, outlining how the 2005\u000a      collaborative study (Myers et al., 2005) is \"widely cited by users of the\u000a      StO2 system to justify the use of the device in physiology and medicine\".\u000a      In the REF2014 impact period, the InspectraTM StO2 series of\u000a      NIRS devices has subsequently led to extensive impact in three areas:\u000a    Commercial impact: As a global technology manufacturer, Hutchinson\u000a      employs 2,000 staff in two divisions. One of these, the BioMeasurement\u000a      Division, designs, manufactures and sells a single product type &#8212; the\u000a      InspectraTM StO2 NIRS system. Over the five-year period\u000a      2008-12, the BioMeasurement Division reported net InspectraTM\u000a      sales of $9.04M [2] [3].\u000a    Clinical impact: The main clinical use of the current technology\u000a      has centred on measurements of the thenar (thumb) muscle saturation as an\u000a      indicator of peripheral oxygen delivery to tissue. Typical patient groups\u000a      include: a) Blood Loss (trauma, post-surgical gastrointestinal bleed); b)\u000a      Elderly (clinical signs confounded by medication, co-morbidities,\u000a      infection or early sepsis); and c) Critical Care Patients (non-alarming\u000a      clinical signs, difficult to diagnose, heart dysfunction). Two devices are\u000a      used. Firstly, the InSpectra&#8482; StO2 Spot Check, which is a small\u000a      portable device used to quickly and cost-effectively identify patients at\u000a      risk for circulatory distress. Once identified to have low StO2 (tissue\u000a      oxygen saturation), patients are then continuously monitored with the InSpectraTM\u000a        StO2 Monitor. These devices both received 510(k) clearance from the\u000a      US Food and Drug Administration in 2011 and 2010 respectively, enabling\u000a      them to be legally used in hospital emergency and critical care\u000a      environments as cost-effective tools to help rapidly assess tissue\u000a      perfusion and shock. There have been over 200 clinical studies on this\u000a      technology, many of which cite the original Essex research. Illustrating a\u000a      number of significant points, these studies show that, for instance, a low\u000a      oxygen saturation can be associated with worse outcomes in critically ill\u000a      patients (Lima et al., Crit Care. 2009; 13(Suppl 5):S13). It is\u000a      also demonstrated that using saturation to guide patient treatment (Miner\u000a      et al., Crit Care Med. 2010; 38(12):S86) can result in significant\u000a      economic benefits in the form of shorter hospital stays (down from 11.4 to\u000a      8.9 days).\u000a    Applied sports impact: Hutchinson spectrometers have been applied\u000a      extensively to examine muscle oxygen biology in applied sport and exercise\u000a      science. A number of published articles report on such use of Hutchinson\u000a      devices. Most notably, these include studies on: muscle oxygenation in\u000a      handball players (Int. J. Sports Physiol. Perform. 2008; 3:251-26);\u000a      sailors (Int. J. Sports Med. 2008; 29:11-15); high-altitude\u000a      climbers (Crit Care. 2009; 13(Suppl 5):S7); and exercise in\u000a      patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (Clin Sci (Lond).\u000a      2009; 117:405-413) and intermittent claudication (PM&amp;R. 2009;\u000a      1:932-940).\u000a    Impacts of muscle optics on elite sports performance: The more\u000a      applied aspects of Cooper's academic research (see: Hesford et al., 2012;\u000a      2013a; 2013b), undertaken in collaboration with the British Olympic\u000a      Association (BOA), demonstrated the potential for using real time wireless\u000a      portable NIRS to enhance elite sports performance. It revealed asymmetry\u000a      in muscle oxygenation due to the nature of the demands of high-speed\u000a      cornering constricting blood flow to the right leg in speed skaters. These\u000a      research findings were then used to test the efficacy of new equipment and\u000a      nutritional supplementation strategies. For example, NIRS research\u000a      demonstrated that nitrate-rich beetroot juice would both enhance\u000a      performance and reduce the muscle oxygen asymmetry. The Head of Sports\u000a      Science and Research at the BOA [4] notes that \"this research made an\u000a      outstanding contribution to the preparation of our winter sports athletes\u000a      for the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver in 2010 and is making an impact\u000a      for the preparation of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi in 2014...In\u000a      particular, the research work improved the understanding of the\u000a      physiological demands of speed skating and allowed the coaching team to\u000a      develop a new approach to train single limbs with specific technical\u000a      drills\". He adds that \"as a consequence of this work, there has been an\u000a      increasing demand in the British sporting community and abroad for the use\u000a      of NIRS in athletic populations\".\u000a    An example of this increasing demand is that Essex was commissioned to\u000a      assist in the training of [text removed for publication] and the British\u000a      hockey team. [text removed for publication] [5] explains that: \"The\u000a      technique suggested that our intended training goal of improving oxygen\u000a      consumption at the level of the muscle was realised in the majority of the\u000a      players tested, helping to inform their future training direction [...]\u000a      this project illustrates that the muscle optics research of Professor\u000a      Cooper has useful application in the real world elite sporting environment\u000a      as a non invasive measure of muscle function\". The Senior Strength and\u000a      Conditioning Coach of the Great Britain and England Hockey Team states [6]\u000a      that: \"Chris Cooper's groups at the University of Essex are leading the\u000a      way in the use of NIRS and proved invaluable for GB Hockey in a recent\u000a      training study [...] the NIRS device proved to be an excellent\u000a      non-invasive assessment tool that has helped quantify performance changes\u000a      and further our knowledge around oxygen kinetics and adaptation rates in\u000a      muscle tissue following a training intervention\".\u000a    Impacts from public engagement: Significant public engagement\u000a      activity has been undertaken by Essex staff, describing their latest\u000a      research in muscle NIRS. As well as national and international coverage\u000a      via broadcast and print media (including international magazines such as Wired)\u000a      sports performance research has been used to engage the public directly.\u000a      Most notably this has been at the Edinburgh International Science Festival\u000a      (EISF). In 2010, Cooper was involved in developing Blood Bar, a\u000a      workshop and show supported in part by a grant from EPSRC. Blood Bar\u000a      featured discussions of the colour of blood and its use in health and\u000a      sport monitoring, including examples of Essex optics research. Blood Bar\u000a      returned to the festival in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and has become one of its\u000a      most popular events. The workshop has also toured to Cheltenham Science\u000a      Festival (2011) and to the Abu Dhabi Science Festival (2011, 2012 and\u000a      2013). In 2011, Cooper organised a live scientific research study adjacent\u000a      to the Blood Bar &#8212; \"Shining Light on Exercise\" &#8212; looking at the effect of\u000a      age and gender on muscle oxygenation during high-intensity exercise\u000a      (Wingate Test). Cooper also gave public lectures in 2010 and 2011 as part\u000a      of the festival program.\u000a    In 2012, EISF staged InMotion, a major interactive exhibition on\u000a      the science of human movement, which demonstrated the latest research in\u000a      this area. Cooper advised on experiments and provided optics research\u000a      equipment for an interactive demonstration on heart rate and oxygen\u000a      saturation. InMotion appeared at the National Museum of Scotland in 2012,\u000a      toured to Abu Dhabi later that year and then returned to be part of the\u000a      2013 EISF. The exhibition will go to the Glasgow Science Centre for six\u000a      months starting at Easter 2014, to mark the Commonwealth Games. Details of\u000a      all the public engagement activities undertaken by Cooper and others are\u000a      included in a letter of support from the Director of the Edinburgh\u000a      International Science Festival [7].\u000a    Evaluation reports show that the Blood Bar filled to capacity each year\u000a      (1,740 children, average age 9.3); the Cheltenham (2,000 visitors) and Abu\u000a      Dhabi (2,400 visitors) events had a similar age spread. InMotion had\u000a      35,000 visitors at the Museum in 2012, 3,500 at the Ocean Terminal Mall\u000a      (Edinburgh) in 2013 and 5,000 in Abu Dhabi [8] [9] [10]. In his letter,\u000a      the EISF Director, notes that; \"We have had a highly productive\u000a      partnership with you and your group over the last four years which has\u000a      contributed to some of the most successful events EISF has staged\" [7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Essex underpinned the development and application of near\u000a      infrared muscle oxygen spectroscopy (NIRS) devices that have had medical\u000a      and sporting applications in three areas:\u000a    1) Research on second derivative spectroscopy underpinned the concept of\u000a      the Hutchinson Technology InSpectraTM tissue\u000a      spectrometers, and later Essex publications validated the technology.

The methods make use of near\u000a      infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This technique uses wavelengths of light &#8212;\u000a      invisible to the naked eye &#8212; that can penetrate deep into tissue. Once in\u000a      the tissue, different wavelengths are absorbed by the blood protein\u000a      haemoglobin, as well as the cellular proteins myoglobin and mitochondrial\u000a      cytochrome c oxidase. Haemoglobin and myoglobin transport oxygen\u000a      to the mitochondrion inside the cell, where the cytochrome oxidase\u000a      consumes it. These methods of oxygen delivery and utilisation are\u000a      responsible for over 95% of the oxygen consumed by the body, and hence the\u000a      vast majority of the energy requirements that drive all cellular\u000a      processes.\u000a    NIRS has been known for over 30 years as a safe and non-invasive means of\u000a      reporting on human biology and medicine with widespread potential for\u000a      on-going applications in sport and exercise sciences. However, a major\u000a      problem with the development of this technology is that near infrared\u000a      light is multiply scattered by tissue. This makes it difficult to convert\u000a      the amount of light reaching the detector into the quantifiable\u000a      concentration of haemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase necessary for\u000a      meaningful physiological and biological interpretation of the data.\u000a      Research at Essex has used interdisciplinary methods to approach this\u000a      problem, combining the complementary expertise of sports scientists,\u000a      psychologists, physiologists, clinicians, physicists and biochemists to\u000a      develop new methods to analyse and interpret data. Important developments\u000a      have been made in both brain and muscle research, but this impact case\u000a      study focuses on the muscle work. The key underpinning research at Essex\u000a      has been in two areas:\u000a    1) The discovery of the use of second derivative spectroscopy of\u000a        deoxyhaemoglobin to eliminate artefacts from light scattering in tissue\u000a        near infrared spectroscopy (Cooper et al., 1998; Myers et al.,\u000a      2005). This method enables absolute concentrations of tissue chromophores\u000a      to be determined, in particular deoxyhaemoglobin (the form of haemoglobin\u000a      that has released its oxygen to tissue), hence informing on oxygen\u000a      extraction. This work was carried out by Professor Chris Cooper (exemplar\u000a      publication: Cooper et al., 1998) and the idea was developed by\u000a      researchers at Hutchinson Technology Inc. (US). Hutchinson applied the\u000a      second derivative technique to a wider wavelength range that also\u000a      incorporates the oxyhaemoglobin chromophore. This meant that the ratio of\u000a      the oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration in muscle could be\u000a      determined. This ratio is defined as tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) &#8212; an\u000a      important clinical and biological parameter. The key piece of original\u000a      peer-reviewed research that validated this technology was undertaken in\u000a      2005 by the company in collaboration with Cooper, who advised on the\u000a      details of methodology and analysis (Myers et al., 2005).\u000a    2) The application of portable NIRS as a means of measuring real time\u000a        muscle oxygen delivery and utilisation that can inform training programs\u000a      (see: Hesford et al., 2012; 2013a; 2013b). As part of a 2007 EPSRC\u000a      `Achieving Gold in 2012' project grant, medical engineers at UCL and Essex\u000a      researchers (biochemists, clinicians, physiologists and coaches) were\u000a      funded to: (i) develop a new portable muscle optics device; and (ii)\u000a      determine the benefits of such a device as a tool to optimise sports\u000a      performance. The Essex team consisted of Cooper (Professor and Project\u000a      Lead), Beneke (Professor and co-applicant, now employed as Professor of\u000a      Sports Medicine in Marburg, Germany), Angus (Lecturer in Exercise\u000a      Physiology, who left Essex in 2011) and Parry (Triathlon coach at the time\u000a      of the study, now Lecturer and Human Performance Unit Director at Essex).\u000a    The bespoke portable device is still under development at UCL. However,\u000a      the sports application ideas developed by the Essex researchers resulted\u000a      in a number of sports science publications using a commercial NIRS\u000a      spectrometer. Arising from this work, a new collaboration was developed\u000a      between Cooper and Dr. Marco Cardinale, at the time Head of Sports Science\u000a      and Research at the British Olympic Association. This funded a PhD student\u000a      at the University of Essex, Catherine Hesford. The collaboration between\u000a      2009-2012 resulted in a series of peer-reviewed publications (see: Hesford\u000a      et al., 2012; 2013a; 2013b) using a new commercial portable muscle\u000a      spectrometer (Artinis Inc. PortamonTM), which demonstrated\u000a      clearly the potential benefits of the use of a NIRS device for monitoring\u000a      elite athletes in the field. This research revealed aspects of the muscle\u000a      physiology, measured in real time by wireless NIRS, that were challenged\u000a      during the extreme stress of short track speed skating.

These articles stated the\u000d\u000a      case for a more individualised approach to coaching and provided practical\u000d\u000a      guidelines for implanting this approach and improving relationships\u000d\u000a      between athletes and coaches.\u000d\u000a    These articles attracted a volume of feedback (mostly via email) from the\u000d\u000a      readership, in the form of comments and observations. Comments came from a\u000d\u000a      range of individuals including athletes and individual coaches, but also\u000d\u000a      from those involved at a higher level and in coach education. An example\u000d\u000a      of this was the Director of the Burton Track and Field Academy (4), a UK\u000d\u000a      Athletics Coach Tutor, who is now incorporating the findings of this\u000d\u000a      research into his own coaching style and in the way he approaches the\u000d\u000a      education of other UK Athletics coaches.

This\u000d\u000a      has been driven by recent policy documents including the `UK Coaching\u000d\u000a      Framework' (SportsCoachUK, 2007) and `Coaching Scotland 2011-2015: A\u000d\u000a      framework for sports coaching in Scotland' (sportScotland, 2011).\u000d\u000a      These documents have called for an increased emphasis on\u000d\u000a      professionalisation and a need for research investigating factors related\u000d\u000a      to coach education and effective coaching behaviours. The research\u000d\u000a      findings underpinning the impact discussed in this case study are part of\u000d\u000a      a body of work carried out by Lorimer, a Lecturer at Abertay University.\u000d\u000a      This body of work examined the empathic accuracy of coaches and athletes,\u000d\u000a      a key factor in social intelligence that influences the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      coach-athlete interactions. This in turn promotes more effective training,\u000d\u000a      increased performance, and coach\/athlete personal satisfaction.\u000d\u000a    This research developed an innovative video-based methodology for\u000d\u000a      assessing empathic accuracy in coach-athlete interaction as near to `in\u000d\u000a      situ' as possible, in contrast to the limited questionnaire designs\u000d\u000a      previously used. This video-based approach has also been shown to be\u000d\u000a      useful for promoting reflective practice in coaches, an essential skill,\u000d\u000a      and part of the assessment requirements of obtaining the higher levels of\u000d\u000a      the UK Coaching Certificate.\u000d\u000a    Key findings include a general lack of accurate understanding of\u000d\u000a      moment-to-moment thoughts and feelings, between coaches and athletes of\u000d\u000a      all levels and across all the sports examined. This is important in\u000d\u000a      relation to two approaches to coaching that have seen increased emphasis\u000d\u000a      in the research literature\/coaching materials over the past 5-years. These\u000d\u000a      are `athlete-centred coaching' and the `personal side of coaching'. Each\u000d\u000a      of these approaches focus on the importance of coaches being trained to\u000d\u000a      understand the individual needs of athletes in order to promote self-ownership, self-regulation, and self-actualisation.\u000d\u000a    This body of research has highlighted a series of potential factors that\u000d\u000a      influence the level of understanding displayed by coaches and athletes.\u000d\u000a      Some factors, such as sport-type, cannot be altered but are flagged to\u000d\u000a      inform coaches, coach educators, and sport psychologists. Other factors,\u000d\u000a      such as relationship duration and group size, can be influenced and this\u000d\u000a      information can play an important role coach planning a potentially\u000d\u000a      important role in policy choices such as which model of athlete and coach\u000d\u000a      progression (e.g. dual development or coaching pathways) to use in the\u000d\u000a      management of a sport and in individual performance enhancement.\u000d\u000a    As well as having a theoretical (e.g. inclusion of interpersonal\u000d\u000a      perception in models of the coach-athlete relationship) and\u000d\u000a      methodological impact (e.g., the ability to measure moment-to-moment\u000d\u000a      cognitive processes in sports coaching), this research has also been\u000d\u000a      published as applied guidelines for coach-athlete interaction. These\u000d\u000a      guidelines focus on increased emphasis on the athlete, improved\u000d\u000a      interpersonal interaction, and intrapersonal awareness. This has wider\u000d\u000a      ramifications for coach education and coach development particular in\u000d\u000a      regards to emphasising a need to change coach education from a focus on\u000d\u000a      content\/declarative knowledge of a sport to procedural\/conditional\u000d\u000a      knowledge of coaching (i.e. how to coach rather than what to coach).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43977","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As well as being recognised and highly cited within academic literature,\u000d\u000a      the research into high\u000d\u000a      intensity exercise is also having a verifiable impact on perceptions of\u000d\u000a      exercise.

The work examined the use of high intensity training to improve\u000d\u000a      both health and\u000d\u000a      endurance capacity. High intensity training involves repeated bouts of\u000d\u000a      supramaximal effort, with\u000d\u000a      each bout lasting no longer than 30 seconds.\u000d\u000a    Exercise is known to be a powerful regulator of human carbohydrate\u000d\u000a      metabolism. However,\u000d\u000a      adherence to exercise is low in the general population, with lack of time\u000d\u000a      cited as a major barrier to\u000d\u000a      exercise adherence. The initial research by Babraj et al was carried out\u000d\u000a      to determine whether low\u000d\u000a      volume, high intensity training could elicit similar improvements in\u000d\u000a      insulin sensitivity to those seen\u000d\u000a      with more traditional, higher volume, lower intensity training regimes.\u000d\u000a      The research demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that HIT markedly improved insulin sensitivity in a sedentary population\u000d\u000a      as assessed by an oral\u000d\u000a      glucose tolerance test. This was the first major study to demonstrate the\u000d\u000a      metabolic health benefits\u000d\u000a      of high intensity exercise. Building on this study, the research into HIT\u000d\u000a      has focused on the\u000d\u000a      minimum amount of training required to elicit performance and health\u000d\u000a      improvements. Subsequent\u000d\u000a      research has utilised different protocols that reduce the duration or\u000d\u000a      number of sprints being\u000d\u000a      performed (2011, 2012). These papers show similar improvements in health\u000d\u000a      outcomes and\u000d\u000a      improvements in aerobic fitness to those associated with longer duration\u000d\u000a      sprints. This has\u000d\u000a      changed our understanding of the required exercise duration for health\u000d\u000a      benefits and is potentially\u000d\u000a      very significant in relation to public health and for development of\u000d\u000a      endurance capacity in athletes.\u000d\u000a    These are major findings and have re-opened the debate on the intensity\u000d\u000a      and duration of exercise\u000d\u000a      needed to promote good health and fitness. In light of the review\u000d\u000a      currently taking place into\u000d\u000a      exercise advice in Scotland, this research is extremely timely. The\u000d\u000a      initial research has been\u000d\u000a      extended to consider different populations. One of the most important of\u000d\u000a      these, given the changing\u000d\u000a      demographics in the UK and the potential costs of ill health in the\u000d\u000a      elderly, is the older population.\u000d\u000a      Determining that lower volume training can significantly improve\u000d\u000a      cardio-metabolic health within an\u000d\u000a      older population is therefore extremely important. The reduction in total\u000d\u000a      exercise time required,\u000d\u000a      approximately 10 minutes total time for each training session, with just 1\u000d\u000a      minute of actual exercise\u000d\u000a      can clearly address one of the main barriers to adherence, that of real or\u000d\u000a      perceived lack of time.\u000d\u000a      This lack of time is also an important factor in performance sport, albeit\u000d\u000a      for different reasons. The\u000d\u000a      research undertaken so far has also demonstrated performance enhancement\u000d\u000a      in competitive\u000d\u000a      athletes, achieved in a very time efficient manner.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44093","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3277605","Name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research carried out in Malaysia impacted on capacity development\u000a      across all sporting nations.

More internationally, in recognition of the\u000a      value of the development reports in building capacity, Olympic Solidarity,\u000a      the Solidarity Commission of the International Olympic Committee has\u000a      developed a platform to make the capacity development process followed in\u000a      this research available to NSAs worldwide.\u000a    In Malaysia, the research has led to the following impacts:\u000a    \u000a      A set of development actions has been established from the report by\u000a        the Olympic Council of Malaysia in order to guide future planning for\u000a        the NSAs: In response to the report, the OCM developed an action\u000a        plan that is being used to help with the development of the NSAs. The\u000a        Hon Secretary of the OCM noted that \"the OCM Strategic Committee should\u000a        study and where appropriate include them as part of OCM's Strategic Plan\u000a        under the section `Developing the capacity of NSAs'\".\u000a\u000a      All NSAs have computers and access to information technology: The\u000a        research showed that some NSAs lacked access to computers and\u000a        information technology. This was impacting on their ability to promote\u000a        themselves, communicate with stakeholders, manage their finances\u000a        properly and to establish and run competitions.

In addition, the Report has identified 10\u000a        NSAs without computers.

As\u000a      a consequence, the capacity development process has been implemented in\u000a      the NSAs of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u000a    \"So far we have evaluated 22 national federations and the feedback is, on\u000a      one side rather pessimistic because the results are not rather good, but\u000a      on the other side, just the process of evaluation served a lot to\u000a      understand the state of our NFs, but for the Secretaries General of these\u000a      federations to understand what their main problems are.\" (Vice- President,\u000a      Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina)\u000a    More importantly, this capacity building process is considered by Olympic\u000a      Solidarity as the main mechanism by which they will facilitate the\u000a      development of Olympic sport organisations in the future. As a\u000a      consequence, Olympic Solidarity have adopted the RAT and have developed a\u000a      platform that will make the capacity building process set out here\u000a      available to all National Olympic Committees in order to develop NSAs\u000a      world-wide.

The programme of research was commissioned in order to\u000a      investigate ways of developing the country's sport system so that it can\u000a      make a greater contribution to the economy. This specific strand of the\u000a      research was carried out with the National Sport Associations, which are\u000a      the Malaysian equivalent of National Governing Bodies. The research aimed\u000a      to evaluate the capacity of the NSAs to contribute effectively to a\u000a      national sport industry and make recommendations for their development.\u000a    An analysis of National Sport Associations was carried out using the\u000a      Readiness Assessment Tool (RAT) developed by Robinson and Minikin (2011).\u000a      This enabled the identification of the gaps that exist between the current\u000a      level of development of the NSAs and what is perceived necessary, by an\u000a      expert panel, for NSAs to be able to contribute effectively to the\u000a      national sport industry. This research was the first application of the\u000a      Readiness Assessment Tool to assess the capacity of a nation's NSA sector.\u000a    Data collection was carried out by a Research Assistant who was based at\u000a      the Olympic Council of Malaysia and National Sport Council for a period of\u000a      four weeks in June and July 2011. The Readiness Assessment Tool\u000a      questionnaire was distributed via the OCM to all 53 member and associate\u000a      member NSAs. Responses were received from 28 of the 36 full members and 5\u000a      of the 17 associate members of the OCM. The results of the questionnaires\u000a      were used to assess the level of organisational development of each NSA,\u000a      which, when compared to the benchmark, allowed an identification of where\u000a      each organisation needs development. A Readiness Assessment development\u000a      report was generated for each respondent NSA and an opportunity was\u000a      provided for their representatives to clarify, dispute and discuss the\u000a      findings.\u000a    The individual findings were then merged to create an assessment of the\u000a      NSAs as a whole, so that recommendations could be made for improving the\u000a      development of NSAs in general. This was the first time the Readiness\u000a      Assessment Tool had been used to do this. The overall findings, supported\u000a      by interviews with the Olympic Council of Malaysia, the National Sports\u000a      Council, the National Institute of Sport, the Office of the Sports\u000a      Commissioner and the Ministry for Youth and Sport led to 27\u000a      recommendations for NSA development ranging from the provision of\u000a      computers to all NSAs to the development of financial procedures and\u000a      policies for all NSAs.

This research was led by\u000d\u000a      Professor David Lavallee after he took up his post at the University of\u000d\u000a      Stirling. The systematic review set out in this case study, was carried\u000d\u000a      out from August 2011-October 2011 and examined the transitions high\u000d\u000a      performance athletes make to other careers after they retire from their\u000d\u000a      sport. The purpose of this study was to provide a systematic review of\u000d\u000a      studies on athletes' career transition out of sport in order to identify\u000d\u000a      the existing evidence base and inform intervention strategies. The\u000d\u000a      research produced a journal article and a series of conference\u000d\u000a      presentations that have disseminated the findings to academic and\u000d\u000a      practitioner communities.\u000d\u000a    The research identified the key variables related to the quality of\u000d\u000a      athletes' career transitions. These variables have been used to train\u000d\u000a      practitioners who are providing proactive (e.g., career planning,\u000d\u000a      providing education of transferable skills) and reactive support (e.g.,\u000d\u000a      coping with emotions, supporting identity reformation process) programmes\u000d\u000a      to athletes to help them prepare for their career transition out of sport\u000d\u000a      and adjust to post-sport lives. This research has found that high-level\u000d\u000a      sporting competition plays an important role in developing transferable\u000d\u000a      skills such as communication and time management, but that athletes who\u000d\u000a      focus exclusively on their sport can become role restricted and be more\u000d\u000a      at-risk of finding it difficult to change career. Athletes who are better\u000d\u000a      prepared for life after sport are able to balance their education and\u000d\u000a      career development alongside training and competition.

The organisations worked with different groups of children\u000d\u000a      and young people in different contexts with the main areas being: (i)\u000d\u000a      personal development (self-efficacy and self-esteem); (ii) gender equality\u000d\u000a      and women's empowerment; (iii) HIV and AIDS; and (iv) peer leader\u000d\u000a      development.\u000d\u000a    This research was designed to build the capacity of these organisations\u000d\u000a      to be able to undertake their own monitoring and evaluation and to be able\u000d\u000a      to move away from having an external agency undertake evaluation on their\u000d\u000a      behalf. The research provided a framework for the participating\u000d\u000a      organisations to design their own monitoring and evaluation projects and\u000d\u000a      provided the appropriate advice, support and training to develop the\u000d\u000a      knowledge and skills necessary for staff to become proficient in\u000d\u000a      undertaking monitoring and evaluation.

The project enhanced the relationship between heritage and\u000d      tourism in three civic tourist destinations through a novel Information\u000d      Communication Technology (ICT) environment that provided integrated and\u000d      user- friendly tourism e-services facilitating advanced access to European\u000d      cultural heritage assets\u000d    The main focus of the project was the development of an ICT architecture\u000d      capable of offering tourists and other users customised e-services for\u000d      retrieving and accessing complex multimedia information, based on cutting\u000d      edge service orientated data mining and multi-agent technology. The\u000d      platform was developed by the team and implemented in three European\u000d      cities, Genoa, Amsterdam and Leipzig. The ISAAC architecture was organised\u000d      in four different layers, a repositories layer, a communication and\u000d      harmonization layer, an applicative services layer dedicated to specific\u000d      applications e-services and a multi-modal human interface layer.\u000d    The ISAAC architecture was designed to incorporate all stages of the\u000d      cultural experience, from the pre-visit to the post-visit. A key\u000d      innovation was the transition from single, isolated technologies to an\u000d      integrated platform with compelling e-services which were selected after\u000d      an evaluation phase. They include an interactive map with a virtual tour,\u000d      event calendar, itinerary planning, profiling, tourism satisfaction\u000d      software and mobile clients (ISAAC 2009a, p14). The feedback on the\u000d      prototype was positive overall. The evaluation report highlighted the\u000d      \"usefulness of the prototype for city partners\" and the fact that \"all\u000d      cities aim to use the platform at the end of the project\" (Mitsche, Vogt\u000d      &amp; Cooper, 2009, p 43).\u000d    Research developed at the University of Sunderland fed directly into the\u000d      content and structure of the ISAAC digital platform. As part of the work\u000d      packaged 1 the Sunderland team led a user survey of current digital and\u000d      non\/digital cultural tourism media, which fed directly into the platform\u000d      (Mitsche et al 2007). The study recommended that the digital platform\u000d      should appeal to different market sectors (tourists and locals) related to\u000d      their different knowledge levels and needs using appropriate\u000d      interpretative media. This was achieved through focusing on interaction,\u000d      senses and good content provision and interpretation. The latter focuses\u000d      on the technology, interpretation and eGovernance from the point of view\u000d      of the various stakeholders &#8212; tourists\/residents\/other stakeholders &#8212; and\u000d      the full life-cycle tourist experience &#8212; pre\/during\/post &#8212; visit &#8212; while\u000d      underlining unique experiential and symbolic selling points.\u000d    The University of Sunderland also participated in the development of\u000d      interpretative strategies for the partner cities of Amsterdam, Genoa and\u000d      Leipzig (Mitsche et al. 2008). As part of Work Package 4 a number of\u000d      workshops were organised enabling cooperation and communication between\u000d      destination managers, stakeholders and communities. An interpretative\u000d      strategy was produced that could be taken up by the partner cities and by\u000d      any other cities independent from, but aligned with their current\u000d      marketing and positioning strategy development level.\u000d    As a result of this work a number of non-technological innovations were\u000d      introduced mostly related with interpretation including: the integration\u000d      of cultural heritage, tourism and IT in the interpretation process; the\u000d      use of stories in positioning and destination management; the integration\u000d      of a variety of tangibles and intangibles in flexible and interpretative\u000d      systems; the tour based bundling approach to enlarging tourist footfall;\u000d      the production of a novel city platform for aggregated user content and\u000d      the development of a new methodological approach to active participation\u000d      based on blended focus groups and user preference evaluation approaches\u000d      (ISAACa, pp 68-77).\u000d    The three partner cities started from different stages in the process of\u000d      developing interpretative strategies, and each independently decided which\u000d      novel stories to tell. Amsterdam focused on the concept of hidden\u000d      treasures (ISAACb), Leipzig on the district of Plagwitz and the\u000d      diverse cultural scene set within the Gr&#252;nderzeit architecture\u000d      (ISAACd), and Genoa on the Palazzi Rolli (ISAACc). The specific\u000d      contents of these themes have been integrated and translated into the\u000d      terms of the ISAAC test cases, ensuring their sustainability beyond the\u000d      life of the project.\u000d    The ISAAC project resulted in a new set of e-services for Genoa tourists\u000d      and residents with \"material and immaterial `stories' running along\u000d      cultural and touristic itineraries throughout the city\" (ISAAC, 2009a, p\u000d      85). The ISAAC project also caused \"significant changes in the city's in-\u000d      house reorganisation around digital modernisation, particularly in how it\u000d      exploits promotes and manages its cultural heritage\" (ISAAC, 2009,a p 85).\u000d      The participation in the ISAAC project also led to a new platform for\u000d      Leipzig tourists and residents where \"users gets an overview of the topic\u000d      Grunderzeit and the different Grunderzeit districts\" (ISAAC, 2009a, p97).\u000d      The municipality of Leipzig believes that the platform will increase the\u000d      attractiveness of its cultural heritage. Finally Amsterdam gained \"a new\u000d      e-service with a virtual tour through the architectural history of\u000d      Amsterdam\" as well as research on \"cultural heritage marketing\", user\u000d      needs and on \"tangible and non tangible aspects of cultural heritage\".\u000d      (ISAAC, 2009a, p91).\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    2The European funded ISAAC Project aimed to enhance the relationship\u000d      between heritage and tourism in urban destinations through a novel\u000d      Information Communication Technology (ICT) environment.

A successful relationship\u000d      between cultural heritage and tourism depends on the implementation of a\u000d      positive communication process that makes the heritage experience\u000d      attractive and meaningful. The tourist encounter can be significantly\u000d      enhanced through effective and engaging heritage interpretation, which\u000d      plays a crucial role in assisting the visitor's process of learning. As\u000d      interest in heritage attractions continues to grow, managers are faced\u000d      with providing new and exciting ways to convey their messages to visitors.\u000d      Interpretation should relate what is being displayed or described to\u000d      something within the personality and the life experiences of the visitor.\u000d      ICT solutions can help a great deal in the interpretation process,\u000d      creating added value by providing better services.

Among other things, the study\u000d      recommended to widen the appeal of digital platforms adapting them to\u000d      different knowledge levels and needs using appropriate interpretative\u000d      media.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44199","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The University of Sunderland led a strong dynamic and influential cross\u000d      sector partnership on a European Social Fund project addressing the\u000d      challenges that demographic change poses in the North East of England. The\u000d      project had a clear impact in the region with the development of\u000d      innovative ways of influencing and addressing the employment and skills\u000d      dimension of the over 50s and European migrants, including Erasmus\u000d      students. A total of 473 participants engaged in the project, 60% of these\u000d      were over 50 years old and 30% from ethnic minorities.(UoS 2012c), p 2).\u000d      The project has resulted in lasting change in the region. It made a\u000d      difference, for example, in the way Durham County Council addresses\u000d      employability challenges of over 50s (DCC 2012 p8). Lessons have been\u000d      shared with other regions where mobility and migration are also important\u000d      (UoS 2012b).\u000d    The Changing People project focused on five Strategic priorities: first,\u000d      to identify effective methods for re-engaging older workers, second to\u000d      develop and deliver innovative ways of training older workers and prolong\u000d      their working lives, third to help employers to change workplace cultures\u000d      and provide flexibility for older workers, fourth to explore methods by\u000d      which older workers could be used to promote entrepreneurship and fifth to\u000d      develop and pilot innovative ways of integrating migrant workers into the\u000d      workforce to address employers' skills needs. As well as acting as a\u000d      project lead partner the University of Sunderland coordinated Work Package\u000d      five on migration and integration. The package considered how migration is\u000d      affecting the North East and identified opportunities for harnessing the\u000d      benefits from inward European migration\u000d    As part of Work Package five, research was undertaken into the work,\u000d      leisure and travel experiences of Polish migrants in the North East of\u000d      England, a community with 25.000 members (UoS &amp; NEMP 2012, p9). The\u000d      research developed two key ideas of Kevin Hannam's mobilities paradigm:\u000d      the interrelation of different forms of mobility and the differential\u000d      power geometries underpinning mobilities. The research identified a number\u000d      of barriers which affected the employability and the quality of life of\u000d      polish migrants, including the recognition of qualifications (UoS &amp;\u000d      NEMP 2012, p54). One of the key conclusions of the research was the need\u000d      for a web based centralised resource of information, which was identified\u000d      as a key demand of the community.\u000d    In response to these findings the \"W\" project was piloted\u000d      in Spring 2011 (UoS &amp; NEMP 2012). The project created an accessible\u000d      online database storing relevant websites migrants may need. By clicking\u000d      the W icon in a website, a new window opened that provided the user with a\u000d      vast array of information relating to the North East. The W project was\u000d      piloted on www.nemp.org.uk, the\u000d      North East migration partnership and www.2b.nepco.org.uk,\u000d      the North East polish community organisation (1). Between July and\u000d      September 2011 the W searching mechanism was evaluated by means of a short\u000d      online questionnaire. 79% of the respondents considered the database\u000d      either useful or very useful.

The W searching mechanism has\u000d      subsequently been improved and is now ready to be rolled out.\u000d    Retaining skilled migrants may provide a viable proposition for promoting\u000d      economic growth. As part of work package five, various innovations were\u000d      proposed for integrating European graduates that have studied in the North\u000d      East. A mobile phone application was developed named EmployME\u000d      (UoS 2012a) (2). The application was a pilot project designed for current\u000d      and recent graduates to help them obtain employment. It was developed in\u000d      summer 2011 by the web development team at the University of Sunderland.\u000d      The app was greatly improved following a four months testing period. It\u000d      consisted of three main elements, career opportunities and development,\u000d      employability advice and networking. The application was positively\u000d      evaluated through a series of focus groups and workshops involving\u000d      students and employers (UoS 2012a, p15-21).\u000d    Much of the project activity was concentrated on bringing together the\u000d      relevant stakeholders, developing a shared understanding of future\u000d      directions and identifying a package of interventions that could be\u000d      mainstreamed. Successful outcomes were presented at national and\u000d      international events so that lessons could be shared (UoS 2012b). The list\u000d      of presentations include the European Employment forum (UoS &amp;NEMP\u000d      2011) and the launch of the million + report \"Research that Matters\" at a\u000d      Parliamentary reception for MPs and Peers (3).

The paradigm puts into question the\u000d      territorial and sedentary precepts of twenty-century social sciences.\u000d      Professor Hannam has led in the development of this paradigm, with a\u000d      series of outputs in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2012. Hannam is editor of the Mobilities\u000d      journal, which he originally developed following the Mobilities, Multiple\u000d      Identities and Citizenship conference held at the University of Sunderland\u000d      in November 2003.\u000d    This case study demonstrates the impact of Kevin Hannam's work on\u000d      mobility and social exclusion for the understanding of the impacts of\u000d      demographic change on the local economy with special attention to European\u000d      migration. Mobilities cannot be described without paying attention to the\u000d      necessary immobilities and social exclusion that are related to it.\u000d      Analysing mobilities involves examining the consequences of this mobility\u000d      for different people and places located in what we might call the fast and\u000d      slow lanes of social life. The work of Hannam also calls attention to the\u000d      interrelation between migration, return migration, tourism and Diaspora.\u000d    The case study presents the impact of a European funded project on\u000d      \"Changing People: Rising to the challenge of Demographic Change in the\u000d      North East of England and Beyond\" that ran between 2009 and 2012. The\u000d      project was submitted under Priority 2 of the European Social Fund which\u000d      focuses on Competitiveness and Employment. The University of Sunderland\u000d      was the leading partner in the consortium which also included the North\u000d      East Polish Community Organisation, the North East Strategic migration\u000d      partnership, the charities Age UK and Mental Health Matters, the regional\u000d      development agency One North East and the Local Authority Durham County\u000d      Council.\u000d    Demographic change has been widely recognised as one of the most\u000d      significant challenges facing Europe. The Changing People project\u000d      responded to these challenges by developing, testing, and delivering new\u000d      ways of addressing a range of interlinked employment and skills dimensions\u000d      posed by demographic change. The case study relates mostly to the work\u000d      package on migration and integration. As part of this package extensive\u000d      research was undertaken into the work, leisure and travel experiences of\u000d      the Polish migrations in the North East of England.\u000d    The Changing People's project led on to a further successful research\u000d      application to the EU lifelong learning programme for which the University\u000d      of Sunderland was the leading partner.

This\u000a      relationship has led to a much more\u000a      comprehensive understanding by WADA of the extent of anabolic steroid and\u000a      growth hormone supply\u000a      and the potential physiological consequences of using these drugs (5.1).\u000a      One of the major unexpected\u000a      findings from this collaboration was that, when growth hormone was\u000a      administered at the correct dosages,\u000a      there were beneficial effects observed. These included cardiovascular,\u000a      respiratory function, lean tissue\u000a      mass development and improvements in strength. However, the subjects\u000a      studied tended to use higher\u000a      than recommended dosages which were detrimental and potentially led to\u000a      increases in cardiovascular,\u000a      cerebral, and hepatic risk. Therefore it can be seen that his work has led\u000a      to greater understanding of the\u000a      health (and consequent economic) consequences of AAS abuse.\u000a    With regard to output 3.3 in particular, Professor Baker was invited by\u000a      WADA to disseminate his findings\u000a      at a Physiological Society meeting at King College (5.4). An invited\u000a      audience comprised an international\u000a      range of scientists and medical staff, support workers and practioners.\u000a      Therefore Professor Baker's work\u000a      has contributed to international understanding of the potential\u000a      physiological benefits and risks of AAS\u000a      abuse. In addition, the research related to counterfeit performance\u000a      enhancing drugs and self-administered\u000a      polypharmacy regimes has been invaluable in informing WADA as to where\u000a      analytical\u000a      capability is most needed and thus this research has directly informed the\u000a      policy makers within WADA in\u000a      terms of shaping future practice.\u000a    Professor Baker's research (3.2, 3.4 and 3.5) has also had direct impact\u000a      for the Welsh Rugby Union\u000a      (WRU) (see 5.2). The recommendations and guidelines arising from Professor\u000a      Baker's research work on\u000a      the potential dangers of steroid abuse in sport have directly informed the\u000a      strategic approach, operational\u000a      policies and procedures of the WRU in relation to steroid abuse.\u000a      Guidelines have now been designed in\u000a      order to ensure that Clubs at all levels throughout Wales are cognisant of\u000a      the challenges involved in\u000a      preventing steroid abuse. As a result of Professor Baker's work, the WRU\u000a      has now introduced an\u000a      educational induction programme involving seminars on the dangers of AAS\u000a      abuse, has initiated a test\u000a      regime, and now offers counselling for affected players. The early\u000a      identification of problems is paramount\u000a      to reducing harmful effects. Professor Baker's research has demonstrated\u000a      that sports drug abusers are\u000a      less likely to seek help (despite simple possession not being a legal\u000a      offence) as some users believe that\u000a      their abuse of such drugs is illegal or otherwise stigmatised. The\u000a      reduction of barriers to health seeking\u000a      behaviours by the use of the WRU guidelines and signposts are therefore of\u000a      critical importance in helping\u000a      to alleviate or prevent health problems. Thus it can be seen that the\u000a      research work of Professor Baker\u000a      has had direct impact for the WRU in their capacity as the leaders of\u000a      community development of rugby in\u000a      Wales and on the health of AAS abusers.\u000a    In 2010, Professor Baker was invited to contribute to the Advisory\u000a      Council on the Misuse of Drugs\u000a      (ACMD) report (5.3) that was sent to the Home Secretary and the Secretary\u000a      of State for Health. The\u000a      report was commissioned due to the ACMD's increasing concerns about the\u000a      use of anabolic steroids by\u000a      the general public, and in particular young people. The purpose of the\u000a      report was to consider the\u000a      evidence of harms and provide advice on potential harm reduction\u000a      mechanisms. The ACMD set out to\u000a      consider the available evidence regarding anabolic steroid use\/misuse,\u000a      physical and social harms. Given\u000a      Professor Baker's findings with regard to counterfeit drugs (3.1) and, in\u000a      particular, the points relating to\u000a      the ease of purchase of such drugs and their potential harmful effects\u000a      arising from skin commensal\u000a      organisms, his work was instrumental in informing the debate and\u000a      facilitating the resultant practical advice\u000a      on the use of such drugs. It should also be noted that this report also\u000a      referenced several other influential\u000a      pre-UWS research papers by Professor Baker.\u000a    Further international impact is evident by the inclusion of Professor\u000a      Baker's findings on the prevalence of\u000a      counterfeit drugs (3.1) in a review report (5.5) which was funded by the\u000a      United States National Institute on\u000a      Drug Abuse and which is disseminated via the US National Library of\u000a      Medicine. This position statement,\u000a      which reviewed the abuse of Androgens and appearance and\u000a      performance-enhancing substances\u000a      worldwide, is used by a wide variety of stakeholders who have an interest\u000a      in Androgen dependence.\u000a    Two further authorities reports (5.6 and 5.7), disseminated by the\u000a      Australian Crime Commission, rely on\u000a      evidence from Baker et al (3.1) identifies the scale of the international\u000a      problem in relation to AAS\u000a      counterfeit supply and the associated potential health and safety issues\u000a      for users.\u000a    In summary, Baker's work has been demonstrated to have shaped public and\u000a      sports policy within an\u000a      international arena, educated stakeholders on harm reduction, and\u000a      potentially safeguarded and protected\u000a      the health of countless AAS users of all ages.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research of Professor Julien Baker, the Director of the Institute for\u000a      Clinical Exercise and Health\u000a      Science (ICEHS), in conjunction with prestigious partners such as the\u000a      World Anti-Doping Agency\u000a      (WADA), has impacted on a number of key issues related to drug abuse in\u000a      sport.

This study revealed that,\u000a      whereas it had been hitherto commonly felt that drug abuse was most likely\u000a      to have been prevalent in\u000a      \"serious\" athletes, in fact there was a far more widespread problem\u000a      associated with the abuse of\u000a      prescription medicines and human growth hormone which was rapidly growing\u000a      amongst exercise\u000a      participants at all levels and genders.\u000a    Professor Baker and his team at UWS have undertaken further related\u000a      research and he has continued to\u000a      develop the critically important collaborative relationship with the World\u000a      Anti-Doping Agency (WADA),\u000a      National Drug Testing Centre (in conjunction with Professor Cowan and Dr\u000a      Kicman of King's College),\u000a      resulting in a number of authoritative and debate shaping co-authored\u000a      papers. For example, the paper\u000a      entitled Counterfeiting in Performance and Image Enhancing Drugs (2009)\u000a      details the extent of fake drug\u000a      availability and the acute adverse effects from contaminated vials. This\u000a      research (3.1) analyses the\u000a      widespread additional problems of drug abuse which are being presented\u000a      through counterfeit substances\u000a      being supplied by overseas online distributors. Counterfeit substances,\u000a      which may bear no relation to the\u000a      described ingredients on advertising\/packaging, are being supplied and\u000a      these drugs may be either\u000a      ineffective or actually harmful due to their reaction on the human system.\u000a      Examples of the harmful effects\u000a      include intramuscular abscesses and communicable diseases. In addition, an\u000a      important area of joint\u000a      research interest (with colleagues from King's College) is the challenging\u000a      task of developing a reliable\u000a      test methodology for the detection of human growth hormone (hGH) abuse in\u000a      the human body. The\u000a      necessity for reliable tests and the challenges in developing such tests\u000a      have been highlighted and\u000a      discussed in Professor Baker's UWS research (see 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 as\u000a      examples) as a critical\u000a      requirement to further understanding the extent of hGH abuse. As a\u000a      naturally occurring substance in\u000a      humans, it has consequently proven to be very difficult to reliably detect\u000a      misuse of human growth\u000a      hormone (a joint grant application of &#163;200K has recently been submitted to\u000a      WADA that would aim to\u000a      develop a unique, new test for its detection).\u000a    Research into emerging trends in designer doping (3.2) profiles the so\u000a      called \"Designer Drug\" problem\u000a      and the fact that cocktails of drugs (polpharmacy regimes, see also 3.3)\u000a      are being taken by individuals for\u000a      a range of purposes (including the \"cosmetic\" benefits associated with fat\u000a      loss and body shape profiling).\u000a      This particular problem was found to be exacerbated by increased\u000a      availability at low cost from online\u000a      overseas suppliers. Usage of these drugs potentially leads to a range of\u000a      damaging effects on the human\u000a      condition. These include elevated blood pressure which can lead to\u000a      increased cardiovascular and\u000a      cerebral risk. Further related research (for example, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5)\u000a      analyses the physiological effects and\u000a      disease manifestations of performance enhancing drugs such as\u000a      androgenic-anabolic steroids, growth\u000a      hormone, and insulin and also provides guidance on the development of\u000a      policies to detect and manage\u000a      such use and abuse. This body of research has demonstrated that\u000a      polypharmacy regimes may prove\u000a      especially difficult to detect because, if they are cycled correctly, the\u000a      opportunity of proving a case of\u000a      doping is almost impossible unless an athlete is actually caught in\u000a      possession.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44505","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research has assisted in mitigating harm to players. It has further\u000a      influenced professional standards and game legislation. Two specific\u000a      examples of impact are presented here to illuminate this case study,\u000a      demonstrating how impact has arisen from the body of research outlined\u000a      above.\u000a    Firstly, a change in Rugby League bylaws, which occurred after a case was\u000a      made by the Chairman of The RLMA to The Rugby Football League which\u000a      occurred as a direct result of research undertaken by Gissane and\u000a      colleagues and, secondly, raising the debate around concussion in sport\u000a      globally, through research into the rapid assessment of concussion using\u000a      the King-Devick test. The RLMA was successful in getting a bylaw regarding\u000a      entering the field of play. Today, that bylaw is still part of RFL Medical\u000a      Standards.\u000a    E.9 Hot Weather Code\u000a    When both clubs medical staff agree that the heat and\/or humidity is\u000a        such that players require additional water they should approach the\u000a        Match Commissioner (or Referee if there is no Match Commissioner) to\u000a        request one or both of the special measures below. (Where there is only\u000a        one Doctor present he\/she is entitled to make the request on his\/her\u000a        own).

For the first time, many amateur players played in the summer.\u000a      The evidence and the consequent bylaw were important to those players\u000a      also. Gissane was awarded the Esso prize for research by the Occupational\u000a      Medicine Society in 2004, in recognition of research and its impact.\u000a    Concussion as a topic is currently being debated in public. As part of\u000a      that debate, the research has been discussed extensively in online forums,\u000a      and has featured in the mainstream press, e.g. the `New York Times'. The\u000a      research that has been conducted by Gissane and his fellow researchers has\u000a      featured prominently in this discussion4,5,6. The discussion in\u000a      the media has included radio shows, television news shows and also\u000a      newspaper reports, raising awareness and stimulating debate amongst a wide\u000a      audience around this important issue.\u000a    The underpinning research focuses on the fact that anyone who\u000a      participates in sport risks being concussed. At the grassroots levels of\u000a      any sport resources and funding are often not available for some of the\u000a      more sophisticated equipment available to professional sports persons. The\u000a      importance of this issue was presented in an article in the journal Neurosurgery\u000a      (Duenas et al. 2013), where Gissane's work was directly cited and\u000a      highlighted. Yet, the risk is still present and coaching and support staff\u000a      must be educated in recognising and assessing the injury. This has led to\u000a      the interest in the research in the media. A simple test is employed,\u000a      which can be used at several sporting levels for minimal costs. It has\u000a      been able to identify un-witnessed concussion which has led to greater\u000a      understanding of the incidence of concussion in sport.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The outcomes of this research have directly influenced practices and\u000a      policies for injury prevention and player health in both rugby league and\u000a      rugby union.

This\u000a      research has been accomplished through a number of international\u000a      collaborations (notably with colleagues in Ireland and New Zealand).\u000a    A series of 14 articles have been produced which examine the incidence of\u000a      injury in Rugby League. As part of this series it was possible to examine\u000a      the effect on injury when the playing calendar was moved from winter to\u000a      summer1 2 and the effect of the advent of fulltime\u000a      professionalism. A medical and performance issue that concerned Rugby\u000a      League medical staff was player hydration\/dehydration as a result of\u000a      having to play in higher temperatures. Initially, the Rugby Football\u000a      League produced leaflets on the subject, and referees allowed support\u000a      staff to enter the field provided they didn't interfere with play. Within\u000a      three seasons, the controller of referees suggested that too many support\u000a      staff were on the field, and that they were doing more than supplying\u000a      water. The Rugby Football League then sought to limit the occasions on\u000a      which support staff could go onto the field. This move concerned the Rugby\u000a      League Medical Association. Their concern was that players would have a\u000a      much reduced access to water, and less opportunity to drink. The issue was\u000a      discussed at the RLMA AGM in 2000 and Dr Chris Wragg (Chairman) went back\u000a      to the RFL to describe the medical position and requested that the RFL\u000a      reconsider its position. He provided evidence in support of this request\u000a      in the form of the Jennings et al (1999) research3 which\u000a      described the risk involved.\u000a    Sport related-concussion is seen as a major problem in team contact\u000a      sports by sports medicine practitioners. Furthermore, the longer term\u000a      consequences can be especially problematic with research suggesting a link\u000a      between concussion and early onset dementia. Research has suggested that\u000a      concussion is under reported, because the diagnosis and management is\u000a      misunderstood. More recently, research by Gissane in collaboration with\u000a      others has sought to describe the problem in both rugby codes4 5\u000a      and its costs6 more fully. It has also sought to make use of\u000a      new tools (e.g. the King-Devick Test) that can be used to identify\u000a      concussion.4 5 Attitudes towards concussion have changed.\u000a      Personnel involved in sport, particularly medical staff, are now keen to\u000a      identify concussion rates, so that problems can be prevented in either the\u000a      immediate, medium or longer term, in order to improve the safety of\u000a      players.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44506","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The published findings from the Pollock et al.

The long-term prognosis is poorly\u000d\u000a      understood; but\u000d\u000a      associated with an increased risk of stress fracture, failure to achieve\u000d\u000a      peak bone strength, and poor\u000d\u000a      performance.

Iron is involved in\u000d\u000a      mitochondrial energy production and\u000d\u000a      the production and maintenance of haemoglobin; thus, a healthy iron\u000d\u000a      balance is crucial for\u000d\u000a      performance. Iron injections have been effective in some, but not in all,\u000d\u000a      studies. Longitudinal data,\u000d\u000a      particularly in elite athletes, are rare and much needed in order to\u000d\u000a      further understand the clinical\u000d\u000a      significance of iron deficiency.\u000d\u000a    The Pollock et al. (2010) paper 1 details the prevalence of\u000d\u000a      aspects of the female athlete triad in 44\u000d\u000a      elite British female distance runners. Low bone mineral density was\u000d\u000a      present in 34.2% of athletes,\u000d\u000a      with 33% displaying osteoporosis of the radius. Pedlar commenced pilot\u000d\u000a      data collection for the\u000d\u000a      project in 2002, concerned that the health of distance runners could be\u000d\u000a      compromised by their\u000d\u000a      training and recovery practices. Female distance runners based at SMUC\u000d\u000a      were encouraged to visit\u000d\u000a      Middlesex University for an annual Duel-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)\u000d\u000a      scan, funded by the\u000d\u000a      English Institute of Sport. Interest grew and a number of collaborations\u000d\u000a      developed with sports\u000d\u000a      medicine practitioners including Dr Roger Wolman and Dr Noel Pollock,\u000d\u000a      prompting the systematic\u000d\u000a      data collection for the purpose of a research study commencing in 2003.\u000d\u000a      Pedlar presented\u000d\u000a      preliminary data at a British Olympic Association professional development\u000d\u000a      session for doctors in\u000d\u000a      2007, organised by Dr Roger Wolman and after sufficient longitudinal data\u000d\u000a      was collected, the paper\u000d\u000a      was published in 2010 by clinician Dr Noel Pollock.\u000d\u000a    The Pedlar et al.

A PhD student supervised by Pedlar is currently studying the\u000d\u000a      efficacy of iron repletion\u000d\u000a      in iron deficient, non-anaemic elite distance runners and has completed a\u000d\u000a      collaborative study with\u000d\u000a      the Mr Toby Richards at University College London (vascular surgeon).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44578","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The review undertaken to inform the further development of the Physical\u000d\u000a      Activity guidelines in 2010\u000d\u000a      (`Making the case for UK Physical Activity Guidelines for Early Years:\u000d\u000a      Recommendations and draft\u000d\u000a      summary statements based on the current evidence') highlighted the need to\u000d\u000a      consider the\u000d\u000a      emerging research in the area of sedentary behaviour.

This is a UK-wide document that presents guidelines\u000d\u000a      on the volume, duration,\u000d\u000a      frequency and type of physical activity required. At p.7, the report\u000d\u000a      highlights the need for\u000d\u000a      minimising the amount of time spent being sedentary for extended periods\u000d\u000a      for all four categories of\u000d\u000a      individuals (Early Years, Children and Young People, Adults and Older\u000d\u000a      Adults) [5.2, 5.7, 5.8]. The\u000d\u000a      report does not specify a quantified target for sedentary time, as per the\u000d\u000a      recommendation from the\u000d\u000a      working group. It does give tailored guidance on limiting sedentary time\u000d\u000a      for early years children\u000d\u000a      (pp.22-25) [5.2, 5.7,5.8]. The report also includes details of\u000d\u000a      strategies to reduce sedentary\u000d\u000a      behaviour, for example `children and young people may engage in light\u000d\u000a      activity and reduce sitting\u000d\u000a      and lying time by playing active computer games or engaging in activities\u000d\u000a      that involve moving in\u000d\u000a      and around the home, classroom or community' (p.29) [5.2,5.7,5.8].\u000d\u000a    From these new UK physical activity guidelines, factsheets have been\u000d\u000a      derived that clearly highlight\u000d\u000a      the guidance in relation to sedentary behaviour that emerged from the\u000d\u000a      working group [5.3].\u000d\u000a    These new policy guidelines have been published by the UK government for\u000d\u000a      use by health\u000d\u000a      professionals and practitioners, providing the first step in raising\u000d\u000a      awareness of the critical health\u000d\u000a      issues of sedentary behaviour for the whole UK population.\u000d\u000a    Wider dissemination and incorporation into guidance documents has also\u000d\u000a      taken place.

Sedentary behaviour &#8212;\u000d\u000a      operationally defined\u000d\u000a      as `sitting time' is distinct from moderate-to-vigorous physical activity\u000d\u000a      (MVPA), the latter being more\u000d\u000a      extensively researched. Work from the Behavioural Medicine\u000d\u000a      research theme [G3.3] has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the significance of this area of work recently by providing\u000d\u000a      an analysis indicating that\u000d\u000a      sedentary behaviour has been implicated in markers of cardio-metabolic\u000d\u000a      health and that it may be\u000d\u000a      a more important indicator of poor health than MVPA (Henson et al 2013,\u000d\u000a      Diabetologica) [3.1].\u000d\u000a      Our initial research in youth, the significance of which is evidenced\u000d\u000a      through the observation that\u000d\u000a      sedentary behaviour patterns track from childhood into adolescence or\u000d\u000a      adulthood [3.4], was\u000d\u000a      through Project STIL (Sedentary Teenagers and Inactive Lifestyles) [G3.1].\u000d\u000a      This was the first\u000d\u000a      large-scale sedentary behaviour study of teenagers in the UK. It produced\u000d\u000a      one of two main UK\u000d\u000a      data sources for self-reported levels of multiple sedentary behaviours [3.3].\u000d\u000a      Very detailed\u000d\u000a      momentary assessment diaries were used to plot the nature, duration and\u000d\u000a      context of sedentary\u000d\u000a      and other behaviours (e.g., MVPA) across weekday and weekend leisure time.\u000d\u000a      This was the only\u000d\u000a      UK data set to investigate sedentary behaviours beyond screen time (TV and\u000d\u000a      computers) and\u000d\u000a      concluded that about one-quarter to one-third of young people watch 4\u000d\u000a      hours per day or more.\u000d\u000a      Data on computer game playing are more variable, but with a significant\u000d\u000a      number reporting to play\u000d\u000a      for more than 1 hour\/day in the mid-2000s [3.3]. The `Sedentary\u000d\u000a      Behaviour and Obesity: Review of\u000d\u000a      the Current Scientific Evidence' report drew its evidence on prevalence of\u000d\u000a      sedentary behaviour in\u000d\u000a      UK youth from several papers published from Loughborough University [3.2,\u000d\u000a        3.3]. The latter\u000d\u000a      research being funded through the Health Education Board for Scotland [G3.2].\u000d\u000a    Two systematic reviews were conducted specifically to inform the\u000d\u000a      `Sedentary Behaviour and\u000d\u000a      Obesity: Review of the Current Scientific Evidence' report: one on\u000d\u000a      tracking of sedentary behaviour of\u000d\u000a      youth over time [3.4] and one on sedentary behaviour and diet [3.5].\u000d\u000a      The review on tracking\u000d\u000a      analysed 21 studies, showing that TV viewing tracks with moderate strength\u000d\u000a      similar to MVPA. This\u000d\u000a      is important in showing some stability of the behaviour in question and\u000d\u000a      the need for well-designed\u000d\u000a      interventions for behaviour change with good fidelity.\u000d\u000a    The `Sedentary Behaviour and Obesity: Review of the Current Scientific\u000d\u000a      Evidence' report had a strong\u000d\u000a      focus on obesity. Our earlier meta-analysis [3.6] on the\u000d\u000a      association between some sedentary\u000d\u000a      behaviours (e.g. TV viewing) and indicators of body fatness in youth,\u000d\u000a      suggested that this\u000d\u000a      association was surprisingly small. This may be due to confounding factors\u000d\u000a      such as diet. The\u000d\u000a      second systematic review for the DoH report, therefore, investigated the\u000d\u000a      association between\u000d\u000a      dietary patterns and sedentary behaviour [3.5] &#8212; the first such\u000d\u000a      review. Analysing 19 study samples\u000d\u000a      for children and 26 for adolescents, results showed consistent\u000d\u000a      associations between sedentary\u000d\u000a      behaviour, mainly screen time\/TV viewing, and unhealthy diet. This is\u000d\u000a      important in suggesting an\u000d\u000a      association between these types of sedentary behaviours with some negative\u000d\u000a      health outcomes,\u000d\u000a      such as obesity and diabetes, and strengthened the justification for\u000d\u000a      national guidelines. This\u000d\u000a      research has been widely disseminated via Scivee.tv (http:\/\/www.scivee.tv\/node\/32396).\u000d\u000a    The reach of the work is demonstrated by the incorporation of the\u000d\u000a      recommendations in the four\u000d\u000a      home countries Chief Medical Officers' report `Start Active, Stay Active'.\u000d\u000a      This new physical activity\u000d\u000a      guidance for all age groups now includes explicit statements on minimising\u000d\u000a      time spent being\u000d\u000a      sedentary each day.\u000d\u000a    "}]
